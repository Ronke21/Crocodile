<text>In astronomy, photometry, from Greek &quot;photo-&quot; (&quot;light&quot;) and &quot;-metry&quot; (&quot;measure&quot;), is a technique used in astronomy that is concerned with measuring the flux or intensity of light radiated by astronomical objects. This light is measured through a telescope using a photometer, often made using electronic devices such as a CCD photometer or a photoelectric photometer that converts light into an electric current by the photoelectric effect. When calibrated against standard stars (or other light sources) of known intensity and colour, photometers can measure the brightness or apparent magnitude of celestial objects.

The methods used to perform photometry depend on the wavelength region under study. At its most basic, photometry is conducted by gathering light and passing it through specialized photometric optical bandpass filters, and then capturing and recording the light energy with a photosensitive instrument. Standard sets of passbands (called a photometric system) are defined to allow accurate comparison of observations. A more advanced technique is spectrophotometry that is measured with a spectrophotometer and observes both the amount of radiation and its detailed spectral distribution.

Photometry is also used in the observation of variable stars, by various techniques such as, &quot;differential photometry&quot; that simultaneously measures the brightness of a target object and nearby stars in the starfield or &quot;relative photometry&quot; by comparing the brightness of the target object to stars with known fixed magnitudes. Using multiple bandpass filters with relative photometry is termed &quot;absolute photometry&quot;. A plot of magnitude against time produces a light curve, yielding considerable information about the physical process causing the brightness changes. Precision photoelectric photometers can measure starlight around 0.001 magnitude.

The technique of &quot;surface photometry&quot; can also be used with extended objects like planets, comets, nebulae or galaxies that measures the apparent magnitude in terms of magnitudes per square arcsecond. Knowing the area of the object and the average intensity of light across the astronomical object determines the surface brightness in terms of magnitudes per square arcsecond, while integrating the total light of the extended object can then calculate brightness in terms of its total magnitude, energy output or luminosity per unit surface area.

==Methods==

Astronomy was among the earliest applications of photometry. Modern photometers use specialised standard passband filters across the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Any adopted set of filters with known light transmission properties is called a photometric system, and allows the establishment of particular properties about stars and other types of astronomical objects. Several important systems are regularly used, such as the UBV system (or the extended UBVRI system), near infrared JHK or the Strömgren &quot;uvbyβ&quot; system.

Historically, photometry in the near-infrared through short-wavelength ultra-violet was done with a photoelectric photometer, an instrument that measured the light intensity of a single object by directing its light onto a photosensitive cell like a photomultiplier tube. These have largely been replaced with CCD cameras that can simultaneously image multiple objects, although photoelectric photometers are still used in special situations, such as where fine time resolution is required.

==Magnitudes and colour indices==

Modern photometric methods define magnitudes and colours of astronomical objects using electronic photometers viewed through standard coloured bandpass filters. This differs from other expressions of apparent visual magnitude observed by the human eye or obtained by photography: that usually appear in older astronomical texts and catalogues.

Magnitudes measured by photometers in some commonplace photometric systems (UBV, UBVRI or JHK) are expressed with a capital letter, such as &quot;V&quot; (mV) or &quot;B&quot; (mB). Other magnitudes estimated by the human eye are expressed using lower case letters, such as &quot;v&quot;, &quot;b&quot; or &quot;p&quot;, etc. E.g. Visual magnitudes as mv, while photographic magnitudes are mph / mp or photovisual magnitudes mp or mpv. Hence, a 6th magnitude star might be stated as 6.0V, 6.0B, 6.0v or 6.0p. Because starlight is measured over a different range of wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum and are affected by different instrumental photometric sensitivities to light, they are not necessarily equivalent in numerical value. For example, apparent magnitude in the UBV system for the solar-like star 51 Pegasi is 5.46V, 6.16B or 6.39U, corresponding to magnitudes observed through each of the visual &#x27;V&#x27;, blue &#x27;B&#x27; or ultraviolet &#x27;U&#x27; filters.

Magnitude differences between filters indicate colour differences and are related to temperature. Using B and V filters in the UBV system produces the B–V colour index. For 51 Pegasi, the B–V = 6.16 – 5.46 = +0.70, suggesting a yellow coloured star that agrees with its G2IV spectral type. Knowing the B–V results determines the star&#x27;s surface temperature, finding an effective surface temperature of 5768±8 K.

Another important application of colour indices is graphically plotting star&#x27;s apparent magnitude against the B–V colour index. This forms the important relationships found between sets of stars in colour–magnitude diagrams, which for stars is the observed version of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Typically photometric measurements of multiple objects obtained through two filters will show, for example in an open cluster, the comparative stellar evolution between the component stars or to determine the cluster&#x27;s relative age.

Due to the large number of different photometric systems adopted by astronomers, there are many expressions of magnitudes and their indices. Each of these newer photometric systems, excluding UBV, UBVRI or JHK systems, assigns an upper or lower case letter to the filter used. For example, magnitudes used by Gaia are &#x27;G&#x27; (with the blue and red photometric filters, GBP and GRP) or the Strömgren photometric system having lower case letters of &#x27;u&#x27;, &#x27;v&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;y&#x27;, and two narrow and wide &#x27;β&#x27; (Hydrogen-beta) filters. Some photometric systems also have certain advantages. For example, Strömgren photometry can be used to measure the effects of reddening and interstellar extinction. Strömgren allows calculation of parameters from the &quot;b&quot; and &quot;y&quot; filters (colour index of &quot;b&quot; − &quot;y&quot;) without the effects of reddening, as the indices m 1 and c 1.

==Applications==
There are many astronomical applications used with photometric systems. Photometric measurements can be combined with the inverse-square law to determine the luminosity of an object if its distance can be determined, or its distance if its luminosity is known. Other physical properties of an object, such as its temperature or chemical composition, may also be determined via broad or narrow-band spectrophotometry.

Photometry is also used to study the light variations of objects such as variable stars, minor planets, active galactic nuclei and supernovae, or to detect transiting extrasolar planets. Measurements of these variations can be used, for example, to determine the orbital period and the radii of the members of an eclipsing binary star system, the rotation period of a minor planet or a star, or the total energy output of supernovae.

==CCD photometry==

A CCD (charge-coupled device) camera is essentially a grid of photometers, simultaneously measuring and recording the photons coming from all the sources in the field of view. Because each CCD image records the photometry of multiple objects at once, various forms of photometric extraction can be performed on the recorded data; typically relative, absolute, and differential. All three will require the extraction of the raw image magnitude of the target object, and a known comparison object. 
The observed signal from an object will typically cover many pixels according to the point spread function (PSF) of the system. This broadening is due to both the optics in the telescope and the astronomical seeing. When obtaining photometry from a point source, the flux is measured by summing all the light recorded from the object and subtracting the light due to the sky. The simplest technique, known as aperture photometry, consists of summing the pixel counts within an aperture centered on the object and subtracting the product of the nearby average sky count per pixel and the number of pixels within the aperture. This will result in the raw flux value of the target object. When doing photometry in a very crowded field, such as a globular cluster, where the profiles of stars overlap significantly, one must use de-blending techniques, such as PSF fitting to determine the individual flux values of the overlapping sources.

===Calibrations===
After determining the flux of an object in counts, the flux is normally converted into instrumental magnitude. Then, the measurement is calibrated in some way. Which calibrations are used will depend in part on what type of photometry is being done. Typically, observations are processed for relative or differential photometry.
Relative photometry is the measurement of the apparent brightness of multiple objects relative to each other. Absolute photometry is the measurement of the apparent brightness of an object on a standard photometric system; these measurements can be compared with other absolute photometric measurements obtained with different telescopes or instruments. Differential photometry is the measurement of the difference in brightness of two objects. In most cases, differential photometry can be done with the highest precision, while absolute photometry is the most difficult to do with high precision. Also, accurate photometry is usually more difficult when the apparent brightness of the object is fainter.

===Absolute photometry===

To perform absolute photometry one must correct for differences between the effective passband through which an object is observed and the passband used to define the standard photometric system. This is often in addition to all of the other corrections discussed above. Typically this correction is done by observing the object(s) of interest through multiple filters and also observing a number of photometric standard stars. If the standard stars cannot be observed simultaneously with the target(s), this correction must be done under photometric conditions, when the sky is cloudless and the extinction is a simple function of the airmass.

===Relative photometry===

To perform relative photometry, one compares the instrument magnitude of the object to a known comparison object, and then corrects the measurements for spatial variations in the sensitivity of the instrument and the atmospheric extinction. This is often in addition to correcting for their temporal variations, particularly when the objects being compared are too far apart on the sky to be observed simultaneously. When doing the calibration from an image that contains both the target and comparison objects in close proximity, and using a photometric filter that matches the catalog magnitude of the comparison object most of the measurement variations decrease to null.

===Differential photometry===

Differential photometry is the simplest of the calibrations and most useful for time series observations. When using CCD photometry, both the target and comparison objects are observed at the same time, with the same filters, using the same instrument, and viewed through the same optical path. Most of the observational variables drop out and the differential magnitude is simply the difference between the instrument magnitude of the target object and the comparison object (∆Mag = C Mag – T Mag). This is very useful when plotting the change in magnitude over time of a target object, and is usually compiled into a light curve.

===Surface photometry===
For spatially extended objects such as galaxies, it is often of interest to measure the spatial distribution of brightness within the galaxy rather than simply measuring the galaxy&#x27;s total brightness. An object&#x27;s surface brightness is its brightness per unit solid angle as seen in projection on the sky, and measurement of surface brightness is known as surface photometry. A common application would be measurement of a galaxy&#x27;s surface brightness profile, meaning its surface brightness as a function of distance from the galaxy&#x27;s center. For small solid angles, a useful unit of solid angle is the square arcsecond, and surface brightness is often expressed in magnitudes per square arcsecond. The diameter of galaxies are often defined by the size of the 25th magnitude isophote in the blue B-band.

===Forced photometry===
In forced photometry, measurements are conducted at a specified &quot;location&quot; rather than for a specified &quot;object&quot;. It is &quot;forced&quot; in the sense that a measurement can be taken even if there is no object visible (in the spectral band of interest) in the location being observed. Forced photometry allows extracting a magnitude, or an upper limit for the magnitude, at a chosen sky location.

==Software==
A number of free computer programs are available for synthetic aperture photometry and PSF-fitting photometry.

SExtractor and Aperture Photometry Tool are popular examples for aperture photometry. The former is geared towards reduction of large scale galaxy-survey data, and the latter has a graphical user interface (GUI) suitable for studying individual images.
DAOPHOT is recognized as the best software for PSF-fitting photometry.

== Organizations ==
There are a number of organizations, from professional to amateur, that gather and share photometric data and make it available on-line. Some sites gather the data primarily as a resource for other researchers (ex. AAVSO) and some solicit contributions of data for their own research (ex. CBA):
* American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO).
* Astronomyonline.org
* Center for Backyard Astrophysics (CBA).

<doc id="207561" wikidata="Q15790761" url="?curid=207561" title="Processor power dissipation">
<text>Processor power dissipation or processing unit power dissipation is the process in which computer processors consume electrical energy, and dissipate this energy in the form of heat due to the resistance in the electronic circuits.

== Power management ==

Designing CPUs that perform tasks efficiently without overheating is a major consideration of nearly all CPU manufacturers to date. Historically, early CPUs implemented with vacuum tubes consumed power on the order of many kilowatts. Current CPUs in general-purpose personal computers, such as desktops and laptops, consume power in the order of tens to hundreds of watts. Some other CPU implementations use very little power; for example, the CPUs in mobile phones often use just a few watts of electricity, while some microcontrollers used in embedded systems may consume only a few milliwatts or even as little as a few microwatts.

There are a number of engineering reasons for this pattern:
* For a given CPU core, energy usage will scale up as its clock rate increases. Reducing the clock rate or undervolting usually reduces energy consumption; it is also possible to undervolt the microprocessor while keeping the clock rate the same.
* New features generally require more transistors, each of which uses power. Turning unused areas off saves energy, such as through clock gating.
* As a processor model&#x27;s design matures, smaller transistors, lower-voltage structures, and design experience may reduce energy consumption.

Processor manufacturers usually release two power consumption numbers for a CPU:
* &quot;typical thermal power&quot;, which is measured under normal load (for instance, AMD&#x27;s average CPU power)
* &quot;maximum thermal power&quot;, which is measured under a worst-case load

For example, the Pentium 4 2.8 GHz has a 68.4 W typical thermal power and 85 W maximum thermal power. When the CPU is idle, it will draw far less than the typical thermal power. Datasheets normally contain the thermal design power (TDP), which is the maximum amount of heat generated by the CPU, which the cooling system in a computer is required to dissipate. Both Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have defined TDP as the maximum heat generation for thermally significant periods, while running worst-case non-synthetic workloads; thus, TDP is not reflecting the actual maximum power of the processor. This ensures the computer will be able to handle essentially all applications without exceeding its thermal envelope, or requiring a cooling system for the maximum theoretical power (which would cost more but in favor of extra headroom for processing power).

In many applications, the CPU and other components are idle much of the time, so idle power contributes significantly to overall system power usage. When the CPU uses power management features to reduce energy use, other components, such as the motherboard and chipset, take up a larger proportion of the computer&#x27;s energy. In applications where the computer is often heavily loaded, such as scientific computing, performance per watt (how much computing the CPU does per unit of energy) becomes more significant.

CPUs typically use a significant portion of the power consumed by the computer. Other major uses include fast video cards, which contain graphics processing units, and power supplies. In laptops, the LCD&#x27;s backlight also uses a significant portion of overall power. While energy-saving features have been instituted in personal computers for when they are idle, the overall consumption of today&#x27;s high-performance CPUs is considerable. This is in strong contrast with the much lower energy consumption of CPUs designed for low-power devices.

== Sources ==
There are several factors contributing to the CPU power consumption; they include dynamic power consumption, short-circuit power consumption, and power loss due to transistor leakage currents:

The dynamic power consumption originates from the activity of logic gates inside a CPU. When the logic gates toggle, energy is flowing as the capacitors inside them are charged and discharged. The dynamic power consumed by a CPU is approximately proportional to the CPU frequency, and to the square of the CPU voltage:

where is the switched load capacitance, is frequency, is voltage.

When logic gates toggle, some transistors inside may change states. As this takes a finite amount of time, it may happen that for a very brief amount of time some transistors are conducting simultaneously. A direct path between the source and ground then results in some short-circuit power loss (formula_1). The magnitude of this power is dependent on the logic gate, and is rather complex to model on a macro level.

Power consumption due to leakage power (formula_2) emanates at a micro-level in transistors. Small amounts of currents are always flowing between the differently doped parts of the transistor. The magnitude of these currents depend on the state of the transistor, its dimensions, physical properties and sometimes temperature. The total amount of leakage currents tends to inflate for increasing temperature and decreasing transistor sizes.

Both dynamic and short-circuit power consumption are dependent on the clock frequency, while the leakage current is dependent on the CPU supply voltage. It has been shown that the energy consumption of a program shows convex energy behavior, meaning that there exists an optimal CPU frequency at which energy consumption is minimal for the work done.

=== Reduction ===
Power consumption can be reduced in several ways, including the following:
* Voltage reduction dual-voltage CPUs, dynamic voltage scaling, undervolting, etc.
* Frequency reduction underclocking, dynamic frequency scaling, etc.
* Capacitance reduction increasingly integrated circuits that replace PCB traces between two chips with relatively lower-capacitance on-chip metal interconnect between two sections of a single integrated chip; low-κ dielectric, etc.
* Power gating techniques such as clock gating and globally asynchronous locally synchronous, which can be thought of as reducing the capacitance switched on each clock tick, or can be thought of as locally reducing the clock frequency in some sections of the chip.
* Various techniques to reduce the switching activity number of transitions the CPU drives into off-chip data buses, such as non-multiplexed address bus, bus encoding such as Gray code addressing, or value cache encoding such as power protocol. Sometimes an &quot;activity factor&quot; (&quot;A&quot;) is put into the above equation to reflect activity.
* Sacrificing transistor density for higher frequencies.
* Layering heat-conduction zones within the CPU framework (&quot;Christmassing the Gate&quot;).
* Recycling at least some of that energy stored in the capacitors (rather than dissipating it as heat in transistors) adiabatic circuit, energy recovery logic, etc.
* Optimizing machine code - by implementing compiler optimizations that schedules clusters of instructions using common components, the CPU power used to run an application can be significantly reduced.

== Clock frequencies and multi-core chip designs ==
Historically, processor manufacturers consistently delivered increases in clock rates and instruction-level parallelism, so that single-threaded code executed faster on newer processors with no modification. More recently, in order to manage CPU power dissipation, processor makers favor multi-core chip designs, thus software needs to be written in a multi-threaded or multi-process manner to take full advantage of such hardware. Many multi-threaded development paradigms introduce overhead, and will not see a linear increase in speed when compared to the number of processors. This is particularly true while accessing shared or dependent resources, due to lock contention. This effect becomes more noticeable as the number of processors increases.

Recently, IBM has been exploring ways to distribute computing power more efficiently by mimicking the distributional properties of the human brain.

== Processor overheating ==
Processors can be damaged from overheating, but vendors protect processors with operational safeguards such as throttling and automatic shutdown. When a core exceeds the set throttle temperature, processors can reduce power to maintain a safe temperature level and if the processor is unable to maintain a safe operating temperature through throttling actions, it will automatically shut down to prevent permanent damage.

<text>VIA Technologies, Inc. () is a Taiwanese manufacturer of integrated circuits, mainly motherboard chipsets, CPUs, and memory. It was the world&#x27;s largest independent manufacturer of motherboard chipsets. As a fabless semiconductor company, VIA conducts research and development of its chipsets in-house, then subcontracts the actual (silicon) manufacturing to third-party merchant foundries such as TSMC.

VIA is also the parent company of VIA Labs Inc. (VLI, ). As an independently traded subsidiary, VLI develops and markets USB 3, USB 4, USB Type-C, and USB PD controllers for computer peripherals and mobile devices.

==History==
The company was founded in 1987, in Fremont, California, USA by Cher Wang. In 1992, it was decided to move the headquarters to Taipei, Taiwan in order to establish closer partnerships with the substantial and growing IT manufacturing base in Taiwan and neighbouring China.

In 1999, VIA acquired most of Cyrix, then a division of National Semiconductor. That same year, VIA acquired Centaur Technology from Integrated Device Technology, marking its entry into the x86 microprocessor market. VIA is the maker of the VIA C3, VIA C7 &amp; VIA Nano processors, and the EPIA platform. The Cyrix MediaGX platform remained with National Semiconductor.

In 2001, VIA established the S3 Graphics joint venture.

In January 2005, VIA began the VIA pc-1 Initiative, to develop information and communication technology systems to benefit those with no access to computers or Internet. In February 2005, VIA celebrated production of the 100 millionth VIA AMD chipset.

On 29 August 2008, VIA announced that they would release official 2D accelerated Linux drivers for their chipsets, and would also release 3D accelerated drivers.

In July 2008, VIA Labs, Inc. (VLI) was founded as a wholly-owned subsidiary of VIA Technologies Inc. (VIA) to develop and market integrated circuits primarily for USB 3.0. VLI was intended to be a &quot;smaller and thus more agile&quot; company that can quickly respond to the changing market. It would later become an independently traded subsidiary in 2020.

In 2013, VIA entered into an agreement with the Shanghai Municipal Government to create a fabless semiconductor company called Zhaoxin. The joint venture is producing x86 compatible CPUs for the Chinese market.

In November 2021, Intel recruited some of the employees of the Centaur Technology division from VIA, a deal worth $125 million, and effectively acquiring the talent and know-how of the x86 division. VIA retained the x86 licence and associated patents, and its Zhaoxin CPU joint-venture continues.

==Products==



By the mid-1990s, VIA&#x27;s business focused on integrated chipsets for the PC market. Among PC users then, VIA was best known for its motherboard (core-logic) chipsets. However, VIA&#x27;s products include audio controllers, network/connectivity controllers, low-power CPUs, and even CD/DVD-writer chipsets. PC and peripheral vendors such as ASUS then bought the chipsets for inclusion into their own product brands.

In the late 1990s, VIA began diversifying its core-logic business, and the company made business acquisitions forming a CPU division, graphics division, and a sound division. As advances in silicon manufacturing continue to increase the level of integration and functionality in chipsets, VIA acquired these divisions at the time to remain competitive in the core-logic market.

VIA has produced multiple x86 compatible CPUs, through its acquisitions of Cyrix and Centaur Technology. VIA produces CPUs through the Zhaoxin joint venture. Many of the CPUs are BGA chips sold pre-soldered onto a motherboard. Some of the VIA x86 processors also contain an undocumented Alternate Instruction Set.

==Market trends==

By 1996, VIA established itself as an important supplier of PC components with its chipsets for Socket 7 platform. With the Apollo VP3 chipset in 1997 VIA pioneered AGP support for Socket 7 processors. VIA&#x27;s market position between 1998 and 2000 derived from the success of its Pentium III chipsets. Around 2001 Intel discontinued the development of its SDRAM chipsets, and stated as policy that only RDRAM memory would be supported going forward. Since RDRAM was more expensive and offered few, if any, obvious performance advantages, manufacturers found they could ship performance-equivalent PCs at a lower cost by using VIA chipsets.

In response to increasing market competition, VIA acquired the ailing S3 Graphics business in 2001. While the S3 Savage chipset was not fast enough to survive as a discrete graphics product, its low manufacturing cost made it an ideal for integration with the VIA northbridge. At the time under VIA, the S3 brand generally held about 10% share of the PC graphics market, behind Intel and Nvidia. VIA also included the VIA Envy soundcard on its motherboards, which offered 24-bit sound. While its Pentium 4 chipset designs struggled to win market share in the face of legal threats from Intel, the K8T800 chipset for the Athlon 64 was popular.

From 2004 to 2012, VIA continued the development of its VIA C3 and VIA C7 as well as other x86 and x86-64 compatible processors, targeting small, light, low power applications, a market space in which VIA continues to be successful. For example, in January 2008, VIA unveiled the VIA Nano, an 11 mm × 11 mm footprint VM-enabled x86-64 processor, which debuted in May 2008, for ultra-mobile PCs. By 2013 with its Zhaoxin joint-venture, VIA continued to create x86-64 compatible CPU designs derived from their 1999 purchase of Centaur Technologies and integrated-graphics systems, owing to VIA&#x27;s earlier relationship and eventual 2001 purchase of S3 Graphics.

==Legal issues==
On the basis of the Integrated Device Technology Centaur Technology acquisition, VIA appeared to have come into possession of at least three patents, which covered key aspects of processor technology used by Intel. On the basis of the negotiating leverage these patents offered, in 2003 VIA arrived at an agreement with Intel that allowed for a ten-year patent cross license, enabling VIA to continue to design and manufacture x86 compatible CPUs. VIA was also granted a three-year grace period in which it could continue to use Intel socket infrastructure.

<doc id="207571" wikidata="Q817668" url="?curid=207571" title="Benjamin Haydon">
<text>Benjamin Robert Haydon (; 26 January 178622 June 1846) was a British painter who specialised in grand historical pictures, although he also painted a few contemporary subjects and portraits. His commercial success was damaged by his often tactless dealings with patrons, and by the enormous scale on which he preferred to work. He was troubled by financial problems throughout his life, which led to several periods of imprisonment for debt. He died by suicide in 1846.

He gave lectures on art, and kept extensive diaries that were published after his death.

==Early years==
=== Childhood ===
Haydon was born in Plymouth, the only son of another Benjamin Robert Haydon, a prosperous printer, stationer and publisher, and his wife Mary, the daughter of the Rev. Benjamin Cobley, rector of Dodbrooke, near Kingsbridge, Devon. At an early age he showed an aptitude for study, which was carefully fostered by his mother. At the age of six he was placed in Plymouth Grammar School, and at twelve in Plympton Grammar School, where Sir Joshua Reynolds had received most of his education. Reading Albinus inspired him with a love for anatomy, and from childhood he wanted to become a painter.

=== Royal Academy ===

Full of energy and hope, he left home, on 14 May 1804, for London, where he entered the Royal Academy Schools. He was so enthusiastic that Henry Fuseli asked when he found time to eat. In 1807, at the age of 21, Haydon exhibited, for the first time, at the Royal Academy. The painting he entered, &quot;The Repose in Egypt&quot;, was bought by Thomas Hope a year later for the Egyptian Room at his townhouse in Duchess Street. This was a good start for Haydon, who shortly afterwards received a commission from Lord Mulgrave and an introduction to Sir George Beaumont. In 1809 he finished his picture of &quot;Dentatus&quot;, which, though it increased his fame, resulted in a lifelong quarrel with the Royal Academy, whose committee hung it in a small side-room instead of in the great hall. That same year, he took on his first pupil, Charles Lock Eastlake, later a leading figure in the British art establishment.

=== Financial troubles ===
The financial difficulties which were to dog him for the rest of his life began in 1810 when, in response to Haydon having achieved a certain amount of commercial success, his father stopped paying him his annual allowance of £200. He also became involved in disputes with Beaumont, for whom he had painted a picture of Macbeth, and with Richard Payne Knight, who had outraged Haydon by denying both the aesthetic and the financial value of the sculptures from the Parthenon, recently brought to Britain by Lord Elgin. Haydon was fascinated by the &quot;Elgin Marbles&quot;, and believed that they provided evidence that ancient Greek artists had studied anatomy. &quot;The Judgment of Solomon&quot;, his next production, was sold for £700, to two Plymouth bankers, and also brought £100 voted to him by the directors of the British Institution, and the freedom of the borough of Plymouth. The income was not enough to pay off all his debts, but it maintained his credit, allowing him to continue borrowing.

==Height of career==
=== Early paintings ===

At the end of May 1814 Haydon took advantage of the cessation of hostilities with France to visit Paris with his friend David Wilkie, and see the art collections gathered by Napoleon from across Europe at the Louvre. Much of what he saw there disappointed him: he described Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Transfiguration&quot;, a painting he had particularly wanted to see, as &quot;small &amp; insignificant&quot;. At François Gérard&#x27;s studio he saw a portrait of Napoleon, and began to develop a fascination with the defeated French leader, although, unlike some of his more radical friends such as William Hazlitt, Haydon never admired him politically.

On returning to England, he produced &quot;Christ&#x27;s Entry into Jerusalem&quot;, which was later to form the nucleus of the American Gallery of Painting, erected by his cousin, John Haviland of Philadelphia. While painting another large work, the &quot;Resurrection of Lazarus&quot;, his financial problems increased, and he was arrested but not imprisoned, the sheriff-officer taking his word for his appearance. In October, 1821, he increased his commitments when he married Mary Hyman, a widow with two young children, whom he had known for some years. In 1823 Haydon spent two months imprisoned for debt in the King&#x27;s Bench Prison, where he received consoling letters from leading men of the day. While there, he drew up a petition to Parliament in favour of the appointment of &quot;a committee to inquire into the state of encouragement of historical painting&quot;, which was presented by Lord Brougham.
=== Further paintings ===
During 1825, following an agreement for his financial support with his lawyer, Thomas Kearsey, Haydon turned, rather unwillingly, to portrait painting, and at first had considerable success. His works in the genre were, however, attacked in a savage review in Theodore Hook&#x27;s weekly newspaper &quot;John Bull&quot;. Haydon later blamed the article for his loss of clientele, and falling back into unmanageable levels of debt. Following a second period of incarceration at the King&#x27;s Bench Prison in 1827, he painted the &quot;Mock Election&quot; inspired by an incident he had witnessed there. The picture was bought by King George IV for £500. Encouraged by this success, he painted a companion picture, &quot;Chairing the Member&quot;, returning to the prison to make drawings of some of the inmates. A third painting of contemporary life showed the audience at a Punch and Judy show in the New Road at Marylebone. His hopes that the king would buy this work were disappointed, a setback he blamed on the actions of the Keeper of the King&#x27;s Pictures, William Seguier.
Among Haydon&#x27;s other pictures were: &quot;Eucles&quot; (1829); &quot;Napoleon at St Helena&quot;, for Sir Robert Peel; &quot;Xenophon, on his Retreat with the &#x27;Ten Thousand,&#x27; first seeing the Sea&quot;; and &quot;Waiting for the Times&quot;, purchased by the Marquis of Stafford (all 1831); and &quot;Falstaff&quot; and &quot;Achilles playing the Lyre&quot; (1832). &quot;Curtius Leaping into the Gulf&quot;, and &quot;Uriel and Satan&quot;. (1843) As a supporter of parliamentary reform, he had the idea of painting a grand canvas of a meeting on Newhall Hill near the Jewellery Quarter, addressed by Thomas Attwood, leader of the Birmingham Political Union. Attempts to raise subscriptions to fund the painting failed, and only sketches were ever made, but Haydon did receive a commission from the new Whig prime minister, Lord Grey, for a picture of the Reform Banquet held at the Guildhall. Completed in 1834, &quot;The Reform Banquet&quot; contained 597 individual portraits. He also made a painting of the &quot;Meeting of the Anti-Slavery Society,&quot; now in the National Portrait Gallery.

==Later years==

Haydon became well known as a lecturer on painting, and from 1835 onwards travelled throughout England and Scotland on lecture tours. He campaigned to have the country&#x27;s public buildings decorated with history paintings showing the glories of the nation&#x27;s past, and within three days of the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834 he visited the prime minister, Lord Melbourne, in order to impress on him the importance of government patronage of art, especially in relation to the opportunities offered by the rebuilding made necessary by the disaster. Although a scheme along the lines of his suggestions was in fact carried out at the Houses of Parliament, Haydon played no part in it. When, in 1843, an exhibition was held at Westminster Hall, to choose designs for paintings to decorate the Houses of Parliament, he submitted two cartoons – &quot;The Curse of Adam&quot; and &quot;Edward the Black Prince&quot; – but the commission charged with choosing artists to carry out the work (which included his former pupil, Eastlake) found neither suitable.

He then painted &quot;The Banishment of Aristides,&quot; which was exhibited, along with other works, at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, where he had hired a gallery several times over the years. The American dwarf General Tom Thumb was then appearing at the same venue; over the Easter week 12,000 people paid to see him, while only 133 visited Haydon&#x27;s exhibition.

===Death===

The artist&#x27;s difficulties increased to such an extent that, whilst employed on his last grand effort, &quot;Alfred and the Trial by Jury,&quot; overcome by debts of over £3,000, disappointment, and ingratitude, he wrote &quot;Stretch me no longer on this rough world,&quot; and attempted suicide by shooting himself. The bullet failed to kill him, and he finished the task by cutting his throat. He left a widow and three surviving children, who were generously supported by Haydon&#x27;s friends, including Sir Robert Peel, the Count d&#x27;Orsay, Thomas Talfourd and Lord Carlisle. A resident of Paddington, he was buried just to the north-west of the grave of Sarah Siddons at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Paddington, London. The cemetery was converted to a park, St Mary&#x27;s Gardens, in 1885. Haydon&#x27;s is one of the few preserved stones. It is modest and eroded but his name is still (2014) just legible.

==Writings==
In 1839 Haydon began work on an autobiography, drawing on materials from his extensive diaries. Before his death he had completed the story of his life up to the year 1820. It was published in three volumes in 1853, edited by Tom Taylor, with additional material from the diaries, under the title &quot;Life of Benjamin Robert Haydon, Historical Painter, from his Autobiography and Journals&quot;.

The autobiography was assessed by the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot; in this way:
:To form a correct estimate of Haydon it is necessary to read his autobiography. This is one of the most natural books ever written, full of various and abundant power, and fascinating to the reader. [...] His love for his art was both a passion and a principle. He found patrons difficult to manage, and, not having the tact to lead them gently, he tried to drive them fiercely. He failed; abused patrons and patronage, and intermingled talk of the noblest independence with acts not always dignified. He was self-willed to perversity, but his perseverance was such as is seldom associated with so much vehemence and passion. [...] To the last he believed in his own powers and in the ultimate triumph of art. [...] He proclaimed himself the apostle and martyr of high art, and, not without some justice, believed himself to have a claim on the sympathy and support of the nation.

:Every reader of his autobiography will be struck by the frequency and fervour of the short prayers interspersed throughout the work. Haydon had an overwhelming sense of a personal, overruling and merciful providence, which influenced his relations with his family, and to some extent with the world. [...] His eager and combative character was partly his enemy, but he had other enemies actuated by motives as unworthy as his own were always high-pitched and on abstract grounds laudable.

Haydon&#x27;s &quot;Lectures&quot;, published shortly after their delivery, showed that he was as bold a writer as painter. He also wrote the long and elaborate article on &quot;Painting,&quot; in the 7th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

==Critical opinion==
Charles Dickens wrote in 1846 that &quot;All his life [Haydon] had utterly mistaken his vocation. No amount of sympathy with him and sorrow for him in his manly pursuit of a wrong idea for so many years – until, by dint of his perseverance and courage it almost began to seem a right one – ought to prevent one from saying that he most unquestionably was a very bad painter, and that his pictures could not be expected to sell or to succeed.&quot; Dickens also observed Haydon&#x27;s art to be &quot;quite marvellous in its badness&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Pupils===

Haydon had several pupils. These included Charles and Edwin Landseer, William Bewick, John Jackson and Edward Chatfield.

===In written works===
* William Wordsworth addressed a sonnet &quot;To B.R. Haydon&quot; in 1815.
* John Keats named Haydon in several of his works, including &quot;Addressed to Haydon&quot; (1816), &quot;To Haydon&quot;, and &quot;To Haydon with a Sonnet Written on Seeing the Elgin Marbles&quot; (1817).
* Lara Kriegel, in her 2007 book &quot;Grand Designs: Labor, Empire, and the Museum in Victorian Culture&quot;, has examined Haydon&#x27;s activities as a design reformer, especially his argument that mechanics and artisans should learn to draw from the figure in order to learn principles of taste.
* Aldous Huxley’s 1921 short story “The Tillotson Banquet” revolves around the rediscovery of a fictional pupil of Haydon and the character of Lypiatt in &quot;Antic Hay&quot; is thought by some to be based on Haydon himself.

===In drama===
* In 1977, the British actor Leonard Rossiter played Haydon in a West End play, written by satirist John Wells, titled &quot;The Immortal Haydon&quot;. It is held to be one of Rossiter&#x27;s greatest performances. A BBC camera crew from the documentary series &quot;Arena&quot; filmed his rehearsals for the show. Rossiter had previously (1969) broadcast a monologue adapted by Eric Ewens from the artist&#x27;s journals. 
* In 2007, Nunkie Theatre Company premiered &quot;Blood, Bone and Genius,&quot; a new one-man play based on Haydon&#x27;s life and diaries, written and performed by Robert Lloyd Parry, in the historic life-drawing classroom of the Royal Academy Schools in London. The first performance took place on 22 June, the 161st anniversary of Haydon&#x27;s suicide. It was specially written to tie in with &quot;The Body Politic,&quot; a display of Haydon&#x27;s anatomical drawings at the Royal Academy of Art.
* In 2008, Vancouver&#x27;s Touchstone Theatre premiered &quot;Influence&quot;, written by Janet Munsil and directed by Katrina Dunn. The story centres on John Keats&#x27; first visit to see the Elgin Marbles, as the guest of Haydon, where they unexpectedly encounter the Greek gods Athena, Hephaestus, and Apollo. The play is set at a time when Keats was still an unknown, under the mentorship of Haydon. The premiere performance was 6 November 2008.
* In the 2014 film &quot;Mr. Turner&quot;, Haydon is played by Martin Savage. He is portrayed both ranting at the Royal Academy, London, at odds with all other Fellows, and in the context of borrowing a large sum of money from Turner, which rather than accepting graciously, is taken with bitterness, as he wishes the sum to be larger.

<text>Optica, founded as the Optical Society of America (later the Optical Society), is a professional society of individuals and companies with an interest in optics and photonics. It publishes journals, organizes conferences and exhibitions, and carries out charitable activities.

==History==
Optica was founded in 1916 as the Optical Society of America, under the leadership of Perley G. Nutting, with 30 optical scientists and instrument makers based in Rochester, New York. It soon published its first journal of research results and established an annual meeting. The group&#x27;s &quot;Journal of the Optical Society of America&quot; was created in 1918. The first series of joint meetings with the American Physical Society took place in 1918.

In 2008, it changed its name to the Optical Society. In September 2021, the organization&#x27;s name changed to Optica, in reference to the organization&#x27;s journal by the same name and geographic neutrality to reflect the society&#x27;s global membership.

In 2024, following an employee whistleblower complaint, Bloomberg News reported that the Optica Foundation Challenge was funded entirely by Huawei. In response, the United States House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology launched a probe and Optica announced that it would no longer accept money from Huawei, remove the company&#x27;s representation on a panel of judges, return donations made by Huawei from 2022 onward, and remove Elizabeth A. Rogan as CEO.

<text>The Nigger is a play by American playwright Edward Sheldon (1886–1946). It explores the relationship between blacks and whites in the melodrama of a politician faced with a sudden, personal dilemma. The play was first performed on Broadway in New York City at the New Theatre on December 4, 1909. The play was adapted to a novel, and a film adaptation, directed by Edgar Lewis, was made in 1915. Because the title was controversial, the film was released in some markets as &quot;The Governor&quot; or &quot;The New Governor&quot;.

<doc id="207580" wikidata="Q2997652" url="?curid=207580" title="Richard Whately">
<text>Richard Whately (1 February 1787 – 8 October 1863) was an English academic, rhetorician, logician, philosopher, economist, and theologian who also served as a reforming Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin. He was a leading Broad Churchman, a prolific and combative author over a wide range of topics, a flamboyant character, and one of the first reviewers to recognise the talents of Jane Austen.

==Early life and education==
Whately was born in London, the son of the Rev. Dr. Joseph Whately (1730–1797). He was educated at a private school near Bristol, and at Oriel College, Oxford, from 1805. He obtained a B.A. in 1808, with double second-class honours, and the prize for the English essay in 1810; in 1811, he was elected Fellow of Oriel, and in 1814 took holy orders. After graduation he acted as a private tutor, in particular to Nassau William Senior who became a close friend, and to Samuel Hinds.

==Career==
===University of Oxford===
In 1825, Whately was appointed principal of St. Alban Hall at the University of Oxford, a position obtained for him by his mentor Edward Copleston, who wanted to raise the notoriously low academic standards at the Hall, which was also a target for expansion by Oriel. 

Whately returned to the University of Oxford, where he had seen the social impact of unemployment on the city and region.

A reformer, Whately was initially on friendly terms with John Henry Newman. They fell out over Robert Peel&#x27;s candidacy for the Oxford University seat in Parliament. 

In 1829, Whately was elected as Drummond Professor of Political Economy at Oxford in succession to Nassau William Senior. His tenure of office was cut short by his appointment to the archbishopric of Dublin in 1831. He published only one course of &quot;Introductory Lectures&quot; in two editions (1831 &amp; 1832).

===Archbishop of Dublin===
Whately&#x27;s appointment by Lord Grey to the see of Dublin came as a political surprise. The aged Henry Bathurst had turned the post down. The new Whig administration found Whately, who was known at Holland House and effective in a parliamentary committee appearance speaking on tithes, an acceptable option. Behind the scenes Thomas Hyde Villiers had lobbied Denis Le Marchant on his behalf, with the Brougham Whigs. The appointment was challenged in the House of Lords, but without success.

In Ireland, Whately&#x27;s bluntness and his lack of a conciliatory manner caused opposition from his own clergy, and from the beginning he gave offence by supporting state endowment of the Catholic clergy. He enforced strict discipline in his diocese; and he published a statement of his views on Sabbath (&quot;Thoughts on the Sabbath&quot;, 1832). He lived in Redesdale House in Kilmacud, just outside Dublin, where he could garden. He was concerned to reform the Church of Ireland and the Irish Poor Laws. He considered tithe commutation essential for the Church.

===Irish national education 1831 to 1853===
In 1831, Whately attempted to establish a national and non-sectarian system of education in Ireland, on the basis of common instruction for Protestants and Catholics alike in literary and moral subjects, religious instruction being taken apart. 

In 1841, Catholic archbishops William Crolly and John MacHale debated whether to continue the system, with the more moderate Crolly supporting Whately&#x27;s gaining papal permission to go on, given some safeguards. In 1852, the scheme broke down due to the opposition of the new ultramontanist Catholic archbishop of Dublin, Paul Cullen, who would later become the first Irish prelate named Cardinal. Whately withdrew from the Education Board the following year.

During the famine years of 1846 and 1847, the archbishop and his family tried to alleviate the miseries of the people. On 27 March 1848, Whately became a member of the Canterbury Association. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.

===Personal life===
After his marriage to writer Elizabeth Whately ( Pope) in 1821, Whately lived in Oxford. He gave up his college fellowship, which could not then be held by married men, and began tutoring and writing. 

An uncle, William Plumer, presented him with a living in Halesworth in Suffolk, and Whately moved there. His daughters were writer Jane Whately and missionary Mary Louisa Whately. One of his nephews was Canon William Pope.

===Death===

Beginning in 1856, Whately began experiencing symptoms of decline, including paralysis of his left side, but he continued his public duties.

In the summer of 1863, Whately was prostrated by an ulcer in his leg; after several months of acute suffering, he died on 8 October 1863.

==Works==
Whately was a prolific writer, a successful expositor and Protestant apologist in works that ran to many editions and translations. His &quot;Elements of Logic&quot; (1826) was drawn from an article &quot;Logic&quot; in the &quot;Encyclopædia Metropolitana&quot;. The companion article on &quot;Rhetoric&quot; provided &quot;Elements of Rhetoric&quot; (1828). In these two works Whately introduced erotetic logic.

In 1825 Whately published a series of &quot;Essays on Some of the Peculiarities of the Christian Religion&quot;, followed in 1828 by a second series &quot;On Some of the Difficulties in the Writings of St Paul&quot;, and in 1830 by a third &quot;On the Errors of Romanism Traced to Their Origin in Human Nature&quot;. In 1837 he wrote his handbook of &quot;Christian Evidences&quot;, which was translated during his lifetime into more than a dozen languages. In the Irish context, the &quot;Christian Evidences&quot; was adapted to a form acceptable to Catholic beliefs, with the help of James Carlile.

==Character==
Humphrey Lloyd told Caroline Fox that Whately&#x27;s eccentric behaviour and body language was exacerbated in Dublin by a sycophantic circle of friends. He was a great talker, a wit, and loved punning. In Oxford his white hat, rough white coat, and huge white dog earned for him the sobriquet of the White Bear, and he exhibited the exploits of his climbing dog in Christ Church Meadow.

==Views==
A member of the loose group called the Oriel Noetics, Whately supported religious liberty, civil rights, and freedom of speech for dissenters, Roman Catholics, Jews, and even atheists. He took the line that the civil disabilities imposed on non-Anglicans made the state only nominally Christian, and supported disestablishment. He was a follower of Edward Copleston, regarded as the founder of the Noetics taken as apologists for the orthodoxy of the Church of England. 

A devout Christian, Whately took a practical view of Christianity. He disagreed with the Evangelical party and generally favoured a more intellectual approach to religion. He also disagreed with the later Tractarian emphasis on ritual and church authority. Instead, he emphasised careful reading and understanding of the Bible.

His cardinal principle was that of Chillingworth —‘the Bible, and the Bible alone, is the religion of protestants;’ and his exegesis was directed to determine the general tenor of the scriptures to the exclusion of dogmas based on isolated texts. There is no reason to question his reception of the central doctrines of the faith, though he shrank from theorising or even attempting to formulate them with precision. On election he held, broadly speaking, the Arminian view, and his antipathy to Calvinism was intense. He dwelt more on the life than on the death of Christ, the necessity of which he denied.

Whately took a view of political economy as an essentially logical subject. It proved influential in Oxford. The Noetics were reformers but largely centrist in politics, rather than strong Whigs or Tories. One of Whately&#x27;s initial acts on going to Dublin was to endow a chair of political economy in Trinity College. Its first holder was Mountifort Longfield. Later, in 1846, he founded the Dublin Statistical Society with William Neilson Hancock.

Whately&#x27;s view of political economy, and that common to the early holders of the Trinity college professorship, addressed it as a type of natural theology. He belonged to the group of supporters of Thomas Malthus that included Thomas Chalmers, some others of the Noetics, Richard Jones and William Whewell from Cambridge. 

He saw no inconsistency between science and Christian belief, which differed from the view of other Christian critics of Malthus. He differed also from Jones and Whewell, expressing the view that the inductive method was of less use for political economy than the deductive method, properly applied.

In periodicals, Whately addressed other public questions, including the topic of transportation and the &quot;secondary punishments&quot; on those who had been transported; his pamphlet on this topic influenced the politicians Lord John Russell and Henry George Grey.

==Legacy==
Whately was an important figure in the revival of Aristotelian logic in the early nineteenth century. The &quot;Elements of Logic&quot; gave an impetus to the study of logic in Britain, and in the United States of America, logician Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) wrote that his lifelong fascination with logic began when he read Whately&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; as a 12-year-old boy.

Whately&#x27;s view of rhetoric as essentially a method for persuasion became an orthodoxy, challenged in mid-century by Henry Noble Day. &quot;Elements of Rhetoric&quot; is still cited, for thought about presumption, burden of proof, and testimony.

Irish historian William Edward Hartpole Lecky thought Whately’s importance and influence greater than his later historical repute would indicate, and that Whately’s unsystematic, aphoristic style of writing might explain history’s relative forgetfulness of him:He had a singular felicity of illustration, and especially of metaphor, and a rare power of throwing his thoughts into terse and pithy sentences; but his many books, though full of original thinking and in a high degree suggestive to other writers, had always a certain fragmentary and occasional character, which prevented them from taking a place in standard literature. He was conscious of it himself, and was accustomed to say that it was the mission of his life to make up cartridges for others to fire.

In 1864, Jane Whately, his daughter, published &quot;Miscellaneous Remains&quot; from his commonplace book and in 1866 his &quot;Life and Correspondence&quot; in two volumes. &quot;The Anecdotal Memoirs of Archbishop Whately&quot;, by William John Fitzpatrick, was published in 1864.

<text>Riverside Park is a scenic public park on the waterfront of the Upper West Side, Morningside Heights, and Hamilton Heights neighborhoods of the borough of Manhattan in New York City. The park measures long and wide, running between the Hudson River and Henry Hudson Parkway to the west and the serpentine Riverside Drive to the east.

Riverside Park was established by land condemnation in 1872 and was developed concurrently with Riverside Drive. Originally running between 72nd and 125th Streets, it was extended northward in the first decade of the 20th century. When the park was first laid out, the right-of-way of the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s West Side Line blocked access to the river. In the 1930s, under parks commissioner Robert Moses&#x27;s West Side improvement project, the railroad track was covered with an esplanade and several recreational facilities. Few modifications were made to the park until the 1980s, when it was renovated and extended southward as part of the Riverside South development.

Riverside Park is part of the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway, a pedestrian and bicycle route around Manhattan&#x27;s waterfront. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation operates and maintains the park, although its operating activities are supported by the Riverside Park Conservancy. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a New York City scenic landmark.

==History==
=== Planning===

The of land in the original park between 72nd and 125th Streets were once inhabited by the Lenape people, but by the 18th century, European settlers used it for farming. Over the years, several villas were also constructed along the river. The area&#x27;s two largest settlements were the villages of Bloomingdale and Manhattanville. In 1846, the Hudson River Railroad (later the West Side Line and Hudson Line) was built along the waterfront, connecting New York City to Albany.

By the 1850s, New York City was growing quickly. The construction of Central Park nearby in the 1860s spurred construction on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Similar development on the Upper West Side was slower: by 1865, only West 76th and 86th Streets had been completed and opened. By an act of the New York State Legislature passed that year, the Central Park commissioners had the responsibility of executing the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, the Manhattan street grid, within Upper Manhattan.

In 1865, Central Park commissioner William R. Martin put forth the first proposal for a riverside park along the Hudson River. An act providing for such was presented to the Legislature by commissioner Andrew Haswell Green in 1866 and approved the next year. In his argument for a riverside park, Green wrote that the only location on the Hudson River waterfront reserved for park space was the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan island. The first segment of Riverside Park was acquired in 1872 by condemning lots for a cost of $7.25 million, or over for each of the in the original park. The park also included the construction of Riverside Avenue, a boulevard lined with trees and overlooking the future park and the waterfront. The avenue was initially laid out in 1868 and was wide for its entire length. The plans for Riverside Park and Avenue came to the attention of William M. Tweed, who bought several lots adjacent to the park in anticipation of its construction.

=== Construction ===

==== Late 19th century ====
Initially, Riverside Avenue had been planned to run in a straight line, which would have required a retaining wall and extensive fill. However, the area&#x27;s difficult topography had come to the attention of the Manhattan park commissioners. In 1873, the commissioners selected Frederick Law Olmsted, a park commissioner who had also designed Central Park, to redesign the park and avenue. Olmsted devised a plan that would create a main road extending from 72nd to 123rd Streets, with overpasses at 79th and 96th Streets, as well as &quot;carriage roads&quot; to serve the nearby neighborhood. The park and drive together would vary between wide. Olmsted&#x27;s plan, which also included designs for Fort Washington Park and Morningside Park, called for these parklands to be designed around the existing landscape. Olmsted wrote in 1873 that Riverside Park &quot;presented great advantages as a park because the river bank had been for a century occupied as the lawns and ornamental gardens in front of the country seats along its banks. Its foliage was fine, and its views magnificent.&quot;

Construction on Riverside Park and Avenue started in 1874 or 1876, and Olmsted was ousted as parks superintendent in 1877. Designers such as Calvert Vaux, Samuel Parsons, and Julius Munckwitz laid out the stretch of park and road between 72nd and 125th Streets in a way that made the park look like the Hudson Valley. Riverside Avenue opened in 1880 and quickly became popular, though parts of the road, such as the 96th Street overpass, remained incomplete through the 1900s. There was no single plan that encompassed the entirety of Riverside Park, which meant it would incorporate a number of separate designs. Olmsted wrote in 1886 that &quot;in many important particulars the design has been mangled,&quot; saying that the park&#x27;s terrain was too steep for recreation, and that Riverside Avenue&#x27;s trees might block views of the river; despite this, Olmsted&#x27;s offer to work with Vaux to create a unified park design was denied. Furthermore, the railroad cut the park off from the waterfront.

With the park&#x27;s construction came land purchases in the Upper West Side. However, development in the neighborhood was slow to come since most of the lots were too expensive for the middle class to purchase, and the wealthy preferred to settle on the East Side of Manhattan. Development of low-density residences and small apartment buildings did not come until the 1880s. These residents formed an organization called the West End Avenue Association, which in 1888 published a booklet titled &quot;West End Avenue: Riverside Park in the City of New York&quot; extolling the park&#x27;s benefits. At the time, few wealthy families had settled in the area. It would take until the 1900s and 1910s before Riverside Avenue and Park gained its present-day concentration of upscale houses.

The park was not extensively developed, either. A temporary tomb for the late U.S. president Ulysses S. Grant was built at Claremont Hill in 1885, since Grant had said he wanted to be buried in New York City. Additionally, paths between 72nd and 79th Streets were laid out in 1891. However, in an 1893 article, &quot;The New York Times&quot; mentioned that &quot;but a small portion of the land thus acquired has been improved so as to be capable of public use.&quot; At the time, Riverside Park did not include the shorefront. In November 1893, a compromise was reached that would allow for the shore to be used for parkland while still allowing access to docks, and two months later, the park commissioners adopted plans to build docks at 79th and 96th Streets. Under an act of the state legislature, the city condemned an underwater area along the shore, which would allow for land reclamation to expand the park. By 1895, paths had been laid out between 96th and 120th Streets. The permanent Grant&#x27;s Tomb opened at 122nd Street two years later. Notwithstanding the lack of park development, Riverside Park still contained nuisances such as outdoor sewerage, squatters&#x27; shacks, and coal emissions from the trains, as well as garbage dumps at 77th and 96th Streets. These conditions persisted through the 1920s.

==== Early 20th century ====

Several structures were built in the late 1890s and early 1900s. Two monuments were built in Riverside Park at the turn of the 20th century: a permanent Grant&#x27;s Tomb at 120th Street in 1897, and the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument at 89th Street in 1902. This would be followed by eight other monuments from the 1900s through 1920s. The construction of these monuments signified a major change in the use of Riverside Park, since the park was no longer being idealized solely as a nature space, though writer Elizabeth Cromley says that the monuments did fit in with the park aesthetic. Another structure built in the park was Columbia University&#x27;s Gould Boathouse, constructed at 115th Street in 1896. The Gould Boathouse was abandoned by the 1920s and burned down in 1927. Other waterfront projects undertaken in the first decade of the 20th century included a stadium for Columbia University, built along land fill. Another proposal, for a new boathouse for the Motor Boat Club, was vetoed by mayor George B. McClellan Jr. in 1906.

The existence of Manhattan Valley at approximately 125th Street blocked the further development of Riverside Park northward. However, in 1898, construction commenced on an ornate viaduct carrying Riverside Drive across the valley to 135th Street. The viaduct, designed by F. Stuart Williamson, was completed in 1901 and consisted of 26 steel-latticed arches rising above ground level. By 1902, plans were made to extend the park&#x27;s border north to 155th Street. Williamson also designed the park extension, which contained stone retaining walls as well as grand entrances designed. The first extension of Riverside Park, from 125th/129th to 137th Streets, was completed in 1902. The city acquired land northward to 158th Street in 1903, and with the completion of this park extension in 1908, Riverside Avenue was renamed Riverside Drive.

In 1906, there was an effort to expand Riverside Park by adding the piece of land bounded by Riverside Drive, Claremont Avenue, and 116th and 122nd Streets. This was seen as historically important because it was the site of Battle of Harlem Heights. The city also envisioned 116th Street as a grand gateway to Grant&#x27;s Tomb. Neither the park extension nor the 116th Street gateway were built, and today, the only remnants of this plan are the wide curves at the intersection of 116th Street and Riverside Drive, where the Colosseum and Paterno apartment buildings sit. The underwater area owned by the city was filled between 1911 and 1912 using rock from the excavation of the Catskill Aqueduct. The landfilling was criticized as it was done without public knowledge. One prominent group to form during this time was the Women&#x27;s League for the Protection of Riverside Park, formed in 1916 to advocate recreational uses within the park. Many of the club&#x27;s members were from prominent or wealthy families, and a sizable number of its early members lived close to Riverside Park.

=== West Side Improvement===

==== Initial plans ====

Even as there was discussion to expand Riverside Park, the New York Central Railroad continued to expand its facilities. This clashed with the ideals of the City Beautiful movement, which led an increasing segment of the population to view the railroad as a nuisance rather than a part of the park. Even so, the railroad was a crucial part to New York City&#x27;s commerce, and as such could not be removed. As early as 1909, there were plans to expand the West Side Line to six tracks within Riverside Park, though this was heavily opposed. The crux of the disagreement was a stipulation that would give New York Central the rights to develop the shorefront with commercial enterprises. The area between 59th and 72nd Streets was being planned for development into train yards, which citizens&#x27; groups strongly opposed, and the city had no money to condemn that land.

Disputes over the railroad&#x27;s role within the park continued for several years. At the time, there were other issues that beset the rail line; in particular, the street-level southern section of the line was known as Death Avenue due to the high level of collisions there. In 1913 New York Central presented a proposal for the railroad to be grade-separated, including constructing a new tunnel within Riverside Park. This plan was received favorably by the citizens&#x27; groups. By 1917, there was a tentative agreement to enact that proposal. Another initiative that aided the redevelopment of Riverside Park was the closure of one of the garbage dumps in 1923. Despite a citywide growth in realty values in the 1910s and 1920s, such benefits did not translate to the area nearest Riverside Park, and in the section between 69th and 89th Streets, real estate values declined slightly. As such, the local community wanted to improve Riverside Park.

The railroad grade-separation proposal remained stalled until the passage of the Kaufman Act in 1924, which forced the electrification of all railroads in the city. The same year, comptroller Charles L. Craig put forth a plan to create a waterfront parkway in Riverside Drive to alleviate vehicular traffic. The &quot;Craig Plan&quot;, the first of four unsuccessful blueprints for the park&#x27;s reconstruction that were proposed in the 1920s, also called for the inclusion of athletic facilities, a feature that would eventually be included in the park&#x27;s reconstruction. The proposal included plans for expanding Riverside Park, such as a freshwater swimming pool between 72nd and 75th Streets; a play field from 75th to 77th Streets; and a recreation building with a new boathouse between 77th and 81st Streets. The plans included land reclamation using excavation from the New York City Subway&#x27;s Eighth Avenue subway line, which created up to of new parkland. Planners thought that the railroad tunnel&#x27;s utility could be increased as well. While some suggested building the parkway atop the tunnel, others proposed converting the top of the tunnel into parkland and building a waterfront parkway instead.

Disputes about the tunnel roof and parkway delayed the approval of a Riverside Park plan for several years, by which point increasing pollution made the park nearly unusable. The Women&#x27;s League endorsed a proposal for converting Riverside Drive&#x27;s bridle trail to a children&#x27;s playground, though they opposed the scenic parkway in Riverside Park. Other organizations also opposed building the parkway in Riverside Park; for instance, the City Club endorsed building the parkway on the waterfront instead, in order to give more space to recreational uses. The waterfront parkway proposal was supported only by a minority of architects and organizations, and was voted down by the Board of Estimate. In June 1929, the city voted to approve a plan that would build the parkway above the tracks, but not on the waterfront.

==== Execution ====

The architecture firm McKim, Mead &amp; White was hired to create plans for the parkway and the grade-separated railroad tunnel (later known as the Freedom Tunnel). In order to meet the requirements of the project, the firm proposed erecting a City Beautiful-style retaining wall with arches, similar to that of a Roman aqueduct, that seemed to support the highway above it. The retaining wall would include parapets and Neoclassical detailing, as well as arches to ventilate the railroad tracks behind the wall. The road would have contained classical flagpoles and lampposts, viewing areas, and resting areas for pedestrians. The plans also called for the reconstruction of the 86th Street marina and the construction of parking lots, playgrounds, and tennis courts.

Work between 72nd and 79th Streets was underway when parks commissioner Robert Moses was appointed in 1934. Moses halted McKim, Mead &amp; White&#x27;s plan, deriding it as a &quot;visionary scheme,&quot; since he thought the highway&#x27;s construction would make the new parkland inaccessible and contain too many pedestrian tunnels. Furthermore, Moses believed that his alternate plan would be completed more quickly and cheaply. Moses&#x27;s biographer Robert Caro described Moses surveying the area prior to his project, and seeing:

a wasteland six miles (10 km) long, stretching from where he stood all the way north to 181st street ... The &#x27;park&#x27; was nothing but a vast low-lying mass of dirt and mud... Unpainted, rusting, jagged wire fences along the tracks barred the city from its waterfront ... The engines that pulled trains along the tracks burned coal or oil; from their smokestacks a dense black smog rose toward the apartment houses, coating windowsills with grit ... [a stench] seemed to hang over Riverside Drive endlessly after each passage of a train carrying south to the slaughterhouses in downtown Manhattan carload after carload of cattle and pigs... [Once, Frances Perkins ] heard Moses exclaim, &quot;Isn&#x27;t this a temptation to you? Couldn&#x27;t this waterfront be the most beautiful thing in the world?&quot;

Moses&#x27;s updated &quot;West Side Improvement&quot; plan, designed by Gilmore D. Clarke, Michael Rapuano, and Clinton Loyd, retained the railroad tunnel under the park, but moved the parkway to the shorefront instead; this would become the Henry Hudson Parkway. As part of the project, the parkway was to connect with the West Side Elevated Highway at the south end of Riverside Park, while the railroad would connect to the High Line viaduct even further south. The parkway was to be built on newly filled land along the shore, requiring the extension of the shoreline by and the dumping of of fill. This resulted in a more contiguous park area, since the roof of the tunnel would then be occupied by parkland. Moses&#x27;s plan was also more actively focused toward recreation: his plan called for playgrounds, tennis courts, wading and swimming pools, an amphitheater, and docks at 79th and 96th Streets. The roof of the railroad tunnel would host several of these recreation fields, while other parts of the tunnel&#x27;s roof would be used by a promenade. The cost as submitted to the New York City Board of Estimate was $11 million (equivalent to $ million in ), of which $6 million would go toward the railroad tunnel alone (equivalent to $ million in ).

By mid-1934, Moses was ready to employ about 4,000 workers through the Works Progress Administration. Filling operations were underway by early 1935, requiring the dumping of of dirt per day. The parkway in Riverside Park was approved in June 1935, and was completed in 1937. In addition, plans for a new boat basin at 149th Street were announced in 1939. The West Side Improvement project was completed by 1941. The project was twice as big as the Hoover Dam&#x27;s construction. In total, the project plan added to the park. Ultimately eight full playgrounds were built, as well as baseball fields and tennis, handball, and basketball courts. Having achieved its goal of rebuilding Riverside Park, the Women&#x27;s League disbanded in 1937.

=== Decline ===

For several decades after the completion of the Moses-era improvements, few changes were made to the park: a memorial grove was added in 1946; a playground at 76th Street was added in 1952; and the 103rd Street playground was restored in 1960. A monument to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, first proposed in 1947, was never realized due a lack of funding and opposition from city officials. Riverside Park had its own New York City Police Department precinct (the 26th Precinct), but this was abolished in 1954.

By 1962, a new children&#x27;s playground was proposed between 102nd and 106th Streets, to be dedicated to the philanthropist Adele Rosenwald Levy. The architect Louis Kahn and the artist and landscape architect Isamu Noguchi prepared plans for a $1 million facility to include among other things, a community center, an amphitheater, and play structures. The plan proved to be controversial: advocates claimed the playground would create additional recreational space, while opponents argued that the playground would be excessively expensive and serve essentially as a memorial to a private figure. Despite having redesigned the playground five times, and having the support of Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr., the designers met with much resistance. In 1963, opponents filed suit to prevent construction of the project, and in 1966, the project was cancelled by the new administration of Mayor John Lindsay.

Ultimately during the 1960s, a playground and a comfort station were added at 76th Street, another comfort station was added at 91st Street, and tennis courts were built between 97th and 119th Streets. Otherwise, the park was neglected, and vandalism and dumping were common. In 1970 a writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that the northern part of the park, in western Harlem, was in worse condition than the original park near the Upper West Side and Morningside Heights. Around this time, several shafts were installed in Riverside Park as part of a project to reduce sewage outflows into the Hudson River, which forced the temporary closure of part of the park.

In 1971, officials proposed converting the West Side Elevated Highway and Henry Hudson Parkway into Westway, a six-lane interstate highway connecting the George Washington Bridge and the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, which would have resulted in the condemnation of portions of Riverside Park. The construction of Westway within Riverside Park was ultimately deemed infeasible due to a state law that prohibited the Henry Hudson Parkway&#x27;s conversion into an interstate highway. The Westway plan was abandoned altogether by 1984.

=== Late 20th century ===

==== Restoration ====
By 1979, NYC Parks was restoring retaining walls and making plans to rehabilitate several playgrounds. The failed Westway proposal had inspired a movement to make Riverside Park a designated city landmark, so as to preclude future construction that might take away parkland. Advocates petitioned the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission to make the park an official city landmark. Riverside Park was designated as a New York City scenic landmark in 1980 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1983.

The Friends of Riverside Park organization was formed in March 1979, initially working to plant new trees and stop deterioration of existing trees. Their projects included the conservation of 500 endangered Dutch elm trees in Riverside Park. The organization soon turned toward preservation-oriented initiatives, successfully working to stop July 4 fireworks shows in the park and plans for a restaurant at the 79th Street Boat Basin. The city indicated in 1983 that it planned to refurbish parts of the park, especially the section between 97th and 110th Streets, at a cost of $910,000. The park&#x27;s partial renovation was completed in 1984. However, Riverside Park was still in a dilapidated state because of funding shortfalls: it lacked any full-time security, park rangers, or recreation workers, and had a staff of 40 workers for the entire park. Throughout the late 20th century, homeless people and drug users would congregate in the park. By the 1990s, there were estimated to be between 75 and 325 homeless people living within Riverside Park, including the Freedom Tunnel.

In 1987, fourteen area cooperatives combined to create the Riverside Park Fund to raise money for maintenance. The Fund also sponsored a proposal for a continuous $3 million path that would run the length of the park to the George Washington Bridge, though this path would be delayed through the mid-1990s. Starting in 1992, NYC Parks restored the retaining wall within Riverside Park between 98th and 120th Streets. By 1994, the Riverside Park Fund was conducting various projects including landscaping, the installation of new playgrounds, and the restoration of existing facilities. A dog run was proposed for the Morningside Heights section of the park in 1998, but was canceled after opposition.

The North River Wastewater Treatment Plant was constructed between 137th and 144th Streets, alongside Riverside Park&#x27;s northern section, during the late 1980s. The Riverbank State Park was built atop the plant, opening in 1993. Ten Mile River Playground was renovated in 1995 for $450,000.

==== Riverside Park South====
In the 1980s Donald Trump, then the owner of the of land just south of Riverside Park that had been the Penn Central freight rail yard, proposed building a massive development including a huge shopping mall and the world&#x27;s tallest skyscraper. Facing great opposition and hobbled by his weak financial position, Trump agreed in 1990 to adopt a new plan for the site put forward by six civic groups. The new plan, called Riverside South, included much smaller buildings centered around a new Riverside Park South, stretching between 72nd and 59th Streets with a similar design to the original Riverside Park. In order to expand Riverside Park by , Trump&#x27;s proposed shopping mall would be eliminated and the elevated West Side Highway would be relocated eastward to grade and buried. A new Riverside Boulevard would curve above the relocated highway, with the park sloping down toward the river. Portions of the former rail yard, such as the New York Central Railroad 69th Street Transfer Bridge, would be incorporated into the new park. As part of the project, Trump and the city agreed to build a new bicycle path connecting Riverside Park with Hudson River Park immediately to the south.
In November 1998, the first phase of the new Riverside Park South started, having been designed by Thomas Balsley &amp; Associates. Phase 1, a section from 72nd to 68th Streets, was opened just over two years later in January 2001. Pier I at 70th Street, part of the railyard, was rebuilt; it maintains its original length of , but is narrower than originally, at . Phase 2, opened in 2003, comprises a waterfront section from 70th Street to 65th Street, including two plazas at 66th and 68th Streets and a jagged waterfront. Phase 3, opened in August 2006, stretches from 65th Street to 62nd Street on the waterfront. Phase 4 opened in 2007 along the waterfront from 62nd to 57th Streets.

The design of Phases 5 and 6, located between the current and future highway alignments, is partially tied to the fate of the highway relocation, the timing of which is still uncertain. However, NYC Parks has approved interim and final designs for those two sections; construction of the interim park started in August 2016. Relocating the highway will require some reconstruction of the park.

=== 21st century ===
By the Fund&#x27;s 20th anniversary, much of the park south of 125th Street had been restored, and Upper West Side and Morningside Heights residents had become invested in the park&#x27;s well-being. The northern section, above 125th Street, still remained deteriorated, with poorly maintained ballfields and a lack of access from nearby neighborhoods. This was attributed to the economic conditions in the neighborhoods adjoining each section: while the Upper West Side was generally wealthy, Harlem was mostly lower-class.

In 2015, after a quarter-century of planning, construction started on a new pedestrian bridge connecting Hamilton Heights to Riverside Park at 151st Street, replacing a tunnel and a long staircase. After some delays, the bridge opened in 2017. Also in 2017, NYC Parks released a master plan for Riverside Park. The plan called for the restoration of the rotunda, Soldiers &amp; Sailors Monument, Cherry Walk, and pedestrian walkways; expansion of the marina; construction of new bicycle paths and a new 111th Street entrance; and construction of new play areas in Morningside Heights and at the north waterfront. A bicycle bypass was proposed in 2016 to reduce frequent congestion and collisions between pedestrians and bicyclists in the park. The first section opened in 2019.

Riverside Park continued to suffer from various problems such as faulty drainage systems and deterioration. In 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that following every rainstorm, water tended to pool on the roof of the Freedom Tunnel and other locations due to the three-tiered topography of the park, and that the tunnel&#x27;s retaining wall was leaking. In addition, there was visible decay in some of the structures within Riverside Park, such as the 79th Street Rotunda, retaining walls, and various pathways. Other issues included the poor design of Riverside Drive&#x27;s curbs and the dilapidated condition of the park&#x27;s trees. The city government announced in December 2019 that it would spend $11.5 million to fix the park&#x27;s drainage systems. Nonetheless, parts of the park remained in poor condition in the early 2020s, with inadequate lighting and bad pavement. A $7.4 million renovation of Ten Mile River Playground was announced in late 2023; during the project&#x27;s planning, a set of dark monkey statues in the playground were removed. Cherry Walk was closed in September 2024 for further repairs lasting six months.

== Geography and design ==
Riverside Park is classified by the Parks Department as a community park covering . The primary section of Riverside Park is the tiered slopes between the Henry Hudson Parkway and Riverside Drive from 72nd Street to 125th Street, designated as both an official New York City landmark and a NRHP site. This section ranges from wide. The eastern border of the park is generally Riverside Drive, a curving avenue with a maximum grade of 1 in 27. Various apartment buildings and religious/educational institutions on Riverside Drive overlook the park. The Henry Hudson Parkway, on the park&#x27;s western border, contains numerous interchanges that are included as part of the official landmark designation.

The 1930s rebuild was designed by architect Michael Rapuano, a Rome Prize Fellow, who placed London plane trees and Robinia trees atop the Freedom Tunnel. At 74th and 97th Streets, curving stone staircases led from the top of the tunnel to the playgrounds below. During the renovation, much of the original topography was modified in order to conceal the tunnel, and large clusters of trees were installed elsewhere in the park. Most of the initial plantings were removed by the 1980s.

There is also a northern section of the park from 135th Street to 155th Street and adjacent to Riverbank State Park. This area is designed more simply than the rest of the park, as the Henry Hudson Parkway is elevated in the area, and much of the space is occupied by parking lots. It is neither protected by the Landmarks Preservation Commission nor listed on the NRHP.

=== Geographical features ===
Sources vary on how many tiers are included in Riverside Park. James T. Dowell of the Riverside Park Fund states that there are three tiers: Riverside Drive on top, the promenade above the Freedom Tunnel below, and the parkland beside the Henry Hudson Parkway and waterfront esplanade at the bottom. The city&#x27;s Landmarks Preservation Commission, as well as the National Park Service&#x27;s NRHP report for the park, say that there are four &quot;registers&quot;: three are similar to those cited by Dowell, while the fourth &quot;register&quot; is the sloping area that connects Riverside Drive and the roof of the Freedom Tunnel. Each of the &quot;registers&quot; serves a specific purpose. The uppermost, which includes Riverside Drive, serves as the border to the park. The central sections, comprising both the sloping region and the plateau above the Freedom Tunnel, contain most of the greenery as well as playgrounds and other recreational facilities. The lowermost register, next to Henry Hudson Parkway, provides a waterfront promenade with views of the Hudson River, as well as the Palisades on the opposite bank.

Before the park existed, poet Edgar Allan Poe was said to have enjoyed sitting on rocky &quot;Mount Tom&quot; at 83rd Street. The rock outcropping still exists and is the only such formation at Riverside Park with a name.

=== Paths ===

The park&#x27;s central &quot;registers&quot; contain various curving pathways amid the greenery. These paths are connected to Riverside Drive and the waterfront level via staircases and ramps.

Riverside Walk, a waterfront walkway, runs the entire length of the park between 72nd and 158th Streets. This walkway includes Cherry Walk, a path between 100th and 125th Streets, which is named for the cherry trees beside it. The grouping of 700 cherry trees was donated in 1909 by the Committee of Japanese Residents.

Riverside Park contains a bicycle lane that runs for most of the park&#x27;s length, except for a small gap in West Harlem. However, there are multiple locations where the bicycle lane intersects with the pedestrian paths, causing congestion. As such, a bicycle bypass is being built within several sections of Riverside Park.

=== Extensions and connections ===
Riverside Park South extends from 72nd to 59th Street on the former Penn Central yard, with an old locomotive on display. Riverside Park South leads to Hudson River Park which leads to Battery Park at the southern tip of Manhattan. With the addition of Riverside Park South and Hudson River Park, a continuous waterfront right-of-way for pedestrians and bicyclists now stretches nearly the length of Manhattan from north to south.

Paths along the river connect the park to Fort Washington Park to the north. The portion of Fort Washington Park from 181st Street to Dyckman Street includes Inspiration Point, a shelter at 190th Street.

=== Wildlife ===
A bird sanctuary exists in Riverside Park between 116th to 124th Streets. New York City Audubon estimates that birdwatchers have seen more than 177 bird species at the sanctuary since the 1980s. About has been reforested and over 3,000 individual plants have been placed in the sanctuary since 1997. More than 80 bird species have been seen at the Bird Drip, a man-made water feature near 120th Street.

Riverside Park contains numerous other species of wildlife. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation states that park visitors can see waterfowl such as Canada geese, mallards, and American black ducks; raptors, such as red-tailed hawks, American kestrels and peregrine falcons; songbirds; raccoons; and reptiles. In addition, a wild turkey named Giuliani was first spotted at Riverside Park in 2003, and several other wild turkeys have since been observed at the park.

== Landmarks and structures ==

===Monuments and statues===
Riverside Park includes numerous monuments and statues.&lt;ref name=&quot;nycgovparks.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== &quot;Amiable Child Monument&quot; ====

The &quot;Amiable Child Monument&quot;, at Riverside Drive north of 122nd Street, on the slope north of Grant&#x27;s Tomb, commemorates the long-ago death of a beloved child, a small boy who died in what was then an area of country homes near New York City. One side of the monument reads: &quot;Erected to the Memory of an Amiable Child, St. Claire Pollock, Died 15 July 1797 in the Fifth Year of His Age.&quot; The monument is composed of a granite urn on a granite pedestal inside a wrought iron fence. Originally erected by George Pollock, who was either the boy&#x27;s father or his uncle, the monument has been replaced twice due to deterioration. It is thought to be the only private, single-person grave on city-owned land in New York City.

==== &quot;Eleanor Roosevelt Monument&quot; ====
The &quot;Eleanor Roosevelt Monument&quot; is located at 72nd Street and was dedicated in 1996. The landscape architects Bruce Kelly and David Varnell designed the planted, circular monument. The artist Penelope Jencks sculpted the larger-than-life statue of Eleanor Roosevelt, the boulder on which it leans, and the foot-stone on which it rests. The architect Michael Dwyer designed inscriptions in the surrounding granite pavement, including a quotation from Roosevelt&#x27;s 1958 speech at the United Nations advocating universal human rights, and a bronze tablet, located in the planting bed, summarizing her achievements.

==== Firemen&#x27;s Memorial ====

The &quot;Firemen&#x27;s Memorial&quot;, located on the west side of Riverside Drive opposite West 100th Street, was dedicated in 1913. The architect Harold Van Buren Magonigle designed the monument as a sarcophagus in Tennessee marble, with a dedicatory inscription on the east side. The artist Attilio Piccirilli embellished it with allegorical figures on the north and south sides, and a bas-relief bronze plaque on the west side. Approached from the west by a grand staircase, the monument sits on a terrace surrounded by a classical balustrade. A tablet, dedicated to the horses who assisted the firemen with their duties, was embedded in the monument&#x27;s terrace paving in 1927.

==== General Franz Sigel statue ====

The General Franz Sigel memorial, at 106th Street, was designed by the architect William W. Bosworth and dedicated in October 1907. Karl Bitter sculpted the centerpiece, an equestrian statue of Sigel, who attained the rank of general in the Union Army during the Civil War. The larger-than-life bronze figure is located atop a stone pedestal at the top of a staircase. The figure formerly had a sword, but it was removed in 1941. NYC Parks restored the statue in the late 1980s.

==== Grant&#x27;s Tomb ====

The design of Grant&#x27;s Tomb, located in the median of Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, is loosely based on the design of the ancient Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. The memorial was dedicated in 1897. The architect John Hemenway Duncan designed the building as a cube with blind colonnades on the east, west, and north sides, and a portico of Doric columns leading to the entrance door on the south side. Atop the cube, he placed a cylindrical dome embellished with Ionic columns, topped with a conical cap. Inside, the principal room is a crypt with sarcophagi containing the remains of President Ulysses S. Grant and his wife Julia Dent Grant. The National Park Service has maintained the tomb since 1958 as the General Grant National Memorial. Grant&#x27;s Tomb is both a New York City landmark and a national monument.

==== Joan of Arc memorial ====
The Joan of Arc memorial, located at 93rd Street, was designed by the architect John V. Van Pelt and dedicated in 1915. The artist Anna Hyatt Huntington sculpted the statue, which depicts Joan of Arc on horseback in bronze. The statue was restored in 1939 and 1987.

==== Louis Kossuth monument ====
The monument in honor of Hungarian leader Lajos (Louis) Kossuth is located at West 113th Street. It was dedicated in 1928. The artist János Horvay sculpted a bronze statue of Kossuth standing atop a stone pedestal, and two more bronze figures at its base. The pedestal is embellished with an inscription and a denticulated cornice.

==== &quot;Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument&quot; ====
The &quot;Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument&quot;, dedicated in 1902, commemorates Civil War veterans of both the Union Army and Navy. Originally planned for Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn, the monument was erected in Riverside Park opposite West 89th Street. The architects Stoughton &amp; Stoughton in collaboration with the architect Paul E. M. DuBoys designed the monument as a circular temple embellished with twelve fluted Corinthian columns atop a rusticated basement, a reinterpretation of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens. The architects sited the monument on a series of stepped terraces surrounded by a low classical balustrade. The Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument is a designated New York City landmark.

==== Warsaw Ghetto Plaza ====

Riverside Park almost received a monument to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which would have been located between 83rd and 84th Streets. A granite plaque, set in the paving at the end of the Promenade, near 84th Street, on October 19, 1947, is inscribed: &quot;This is the site for the American memorial to the heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto Battle April–May 1943 and to the six million Jews of Europe martyred in the cause of human liberty.&quot; Subsequent proposals for larger monuments were made by Jo Davidson, Percival Goodman, Ivan Meštrović, and a partnership between Erich Mendelsohn and Nathan Rapoport; however, none were approved due to a lack of funding and officials&#x27; fears that a large monument might distract drivers on the Henry Hudson Parkway. A monument measuring with a height of , to be sculpted by Meštrović, was approved in 1952 but was never built. NYC Parks restored the site in 2001. It is now called the Warsaw Ghetto Memorial Plaza.

==== Other monuments ====
There are several other monuments in Riverside Park. These include:
* 1956 Hungarian Revolution memorial: designed by Tamás Nagy and dedicated in 2017.
* &quot;Hippopotamus Fountain&quot;, at 91st Street: designed by the landscape architect Mark K. Morrison, sculpted by the artist Bob Cassilly, and dedicated in 1993.
* General Horace Porter memorial, at 122nd Street (at Grant&#x27;s Tomb): a flagpole on a pedestal, dedicated in 1939.
* John Merven Carrere memorial, at 99th Street: a pink granite terrace designed by the architect Thomas Hastings and dedicated to the architect John Merven Carrère in 1919.
* &quot;Major General Frederick D. Grant&quot;, at 122nd Street (at Grant&#x27;s Tomb): a flagpole on a pedestal dedicated in 1939.
* &quot;Robert Ray Hamilton Fountain&quot;, at 76th Street: designed by the architects Warren and Wetmore and dedicated in 1906.
* Woman&#x27;s Health Protective Association memorial, at 116th Street: sculpted by Bruno Louis Zimm and composed of a stele, an exedra, and a drinking fountain, it was dedicated in 1910.

==== Plaques ====
There are several plaques in Riverside Park that commemorate various events or structures. These include:
* Armed Forces Plaque, at 121st Street, dedicated 1953
* Battle of Harlem Heights Marker, at 121st Street, dedicated 1961
* Chaplains Memorial. at 121st Street, dedicated 1950
* Chinese Tablet, at about 124th Street (north of Grant&#x27;s Tomb), dedicated 1897

* Henry Neufeld Playground Plaque, at 76th Street, dedicated 1991
* Marine Heroes Tablet, at 93rd Street, dedicated 1950

===Other structures===
Riverside Park contains several other physical structures, including a three-story rotunda with a boat basin, a field house, and a building used by Riverside Park Conservancy volunteer operations.

==== 79th Street Boat Basin, Rotunda, and cafe ====

The 79th Street Boat Basin is one of the boating facilities in Riverside Park. The basin contained 116 slips and was used as a launch site for kayaks, canoes and sailboats. It took in hundreds of thousands of dollars in dock-fee revenues each year. NYC Parks provided fresh water lines and a boat pump-out system for sewage disposal at no additional cost, but all other services, including electricity, telephone, television, and internet access, were charged to boat owners. The marina closed for rebuilding in 2021.

Adjacent to the boat basin, the 79th Street Rotunda, a three-story traffic circle, allows access to the Henry Hudson Parkway and to the park from 79th Street. The rotunda is constructed with reinforced concrete clad with cut stone. An underground parking garage sits below it.

An arcade with vaulted Guastavino tiled ceilings surrounds the rotunda and overlooks the marina. Currently, it is the site of the open-air O&#x27;Neals&#x27; West 79th Street Boat Basin Cafe. The internal courtyard and seasonal cafe were added after a design competition.

The designs of the 79th Street Rotunda and Boat Basin have changed little since their construction. The structures were designed to make Riverside Park into a grand &quot;river gate&quot; for marine travelers.

==== 102nd Street Field House ====
The 102nd Street Field House, adjacent to the Freedom Tunnel structure, was completed in 1937. NYC Parks renovated it in 1964 but it was damaged by fire in the 1970s. NYC Parks renovated the Field House again starting in 2015.

==== Peter Jay Sharp Volunteer House ====
The Peter Jay Sharp Volunteer House is located at 107th Street. Built in the late 19th century, the structure was formerly a one-story limestone tool shed that had become dilapidated over the years. In 2003, the architects Murphy Burnham &amp; Buttrick converted the building into an architectural folly, adding a mezzanine and second floor, expanding the floor area from . The Riverside Park Conservancy operates out of the building, with facilities to aid their operation, including: storage space, plant-growing areas, a restroom, a kitchenette, and a meeting room on the second floor.

== Activities ==
Riverside Park&#x27;s numerous recreation facilities include tennis, volleyball and basketball courts; soccer fields; and a skatepark.

===Play areas===
Riverside Park contains several playgrounds. All of the following playgrounds are located near the intersection with Riverside Drive unless otherwise stated.
* Little Engine Playground, at Riverside Boulevard between 67th and 68th Streets
* Classic Playground, at 74th Street
* Neufeld Playground, at 76th Street
* River Run Playground, at 83rd Street
* Hippo Playground, at 91st Street
* Dinosaur Playground, at 97th Street
* 101st St. Soccer Field, at 101st Street
* Riverside Park, at 119th Street
* Claremont, at 124th Street
* Riverbank Playground, at 142nd Street
* Ten Mile River, at 148th Street
* Palisades Playground, at 148th Street

Playgrounds that are designated as &quot;Tot Lots&quot; include:
* Tot Lot One Hundred Five, at 105th Street
* Tot Lot One Hundred And Ten, at 110th–111th Streets
* Tot Lot One Hundred And Twelve, at 112th–113th Streets
* Tot Lot One Hundred And Sixteen, at 116th–117th Streets

Riverside Park contains three dog runs at 72nd, 87th, and 105th Streets.

In addition, Riverside Park contains Riverside Skatepark at 109th Street. It was the first full-sized public skatepark in Manhattan, designed and built in 1995 by skateboarder and skatepark builder Andy Kessler.

=== Recreation ===
Riverside Park contains a number of facilities. There are nine baseball fields in the park, including five standalone fields (four from 104th to 107th Streets and one at 72nd Street), as well as two pairs of baseball fields that each overlap with another sporting field, at 77th and 146th/147th Streets. There are also five sets of basketball courts at 71st, 76th, 102nd, 111th, and 148th Streets. Seven handball courts are located in Riverside Park, five at 111th Street and two at 71st Street, as well as 20 tennis courts, ten each at 96th and 119th Streets. There are also six soccer fields, at 71st, 74th, 77th, 101st, 103rd, and 107th Streets. Volleyball courts are located at 102nd, 105th, and 148th Streets. Most of the facilities were built in the 1930s reconstruction of Riverside Park, except a recreational building near West 91st Street, as well as the Columbia University tennis courts near 119th–121st Streets.

A free season of events, named Summer on the Hudson, takes place throughout Riverside Park between May and October and hosts events for all including movies, concerts, and children&#x27;s shows. In addition to the 79th Street Boat Basin, there is a kayak launch at 148th Street. During the spring and the summer, a free kayak rental also operates at 72nd Street.
The Riverside Clay Tennis Association (RCTA) operates ten red-clay tennis courts near 96th Street, which are open to the general public.

==Management==
A nonprofit organization called the Riverside Park Conservancy maintains the park. while NYC Parks owns and operates the land and facilities. The Conservancy&#x27;s responsibilities include maintaining and restoring park areas, as well as providing educational and cultural programs. In the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, the Conservancy had net assets (own equity) of about $4.82 million and liabilities of $1.34 million, which amounted to total assets of $6.16 million. Net assets increased $630,000 from the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.

In the late 1970s, New York City&#x27;s park system was in bad shape: underfunded and plagued with crime. As a result, the Riverside Park Fund was founded in 1987 as a grassroots community organization formed to reclaim the park by establishing community gardens and improving park maintenance. The Fund was renamed the Riverside Park Conservancy in 2012. Merritt Birnbaum, who was previously executive director of the Friends of Governor&#x27;s Island, was named President &amp; CEO in 2022. It has 30 staff who focus on park programs and projects, including gardens, playgrounds, sports fields, monuments and landscaping. Cumulatively the Conservancy had received $6.6 million in private donations and had spent 80,000 worker-hours on restoring the park.

===Robert M. Morgenthau Citizenship Award===
The Robert M. Morgenthau Citizenship Award was created by the Riverside Park Conservancy in 2016, in honor of Robert Morgenthau, the former Manhattan District Attorney. It is granted each year for service to the park and the community.

== Transportation ==
There are several New York City Subway stations within two blocks of the park, particularly those on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line () from 72nd Street to 145th Street. Direct bus service is provided by the buses along Riverside Drive, as well as the crosstown routes.

<text>Leo Anthony Gallagher Jr. (July 24, 1946 – November 11, 2022), known simply as Gallagher, was an American comedian who became one of the most recognizable comedic performers of the 1980s for his prop-based and observational style. His signature routine involved the &quot;Sledge-O-Matic&quot;, a large mallet-like tool which he used to smash various items, most notably watermelons. For more than 30 years, he played between 100 and 200 shows a year, destroying tens of thousands of melons.

==Early life==
Gallagher was born in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on July 24, 1946, to a family of Irish and Croatian heritage. Until the age of nine, he lived in Lorain, Ohio, but because of his asthma, the family moved to South Tampa, Florida, where he attended Henry B. Plant High School. He went on to graduate from the University of South Florida with a chemical engineering degree in 1970. He minored in English literature.

==Career==
After college, Gallagher began working as comic/musician Jim Stafford&#x27;s road manager. Stafford and Gallagher traveled to California in 1969; during which time, Gallagher decided to perform as well. He began honing his own comedy act while frequenting both The Comedy Store and The Ice House. He performed twice on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; when Johnny Carson was hosting, though Carson disliked prop comedy. He first appeared on the show on December 5, 1975, when he demonstrated his prop, &quot;The Tonight Show Home Game&quot;, and again on May 9, 1979. He also performed several times on the show when guest hosts were filling in for Carson. Additionally, Gallagher made appearances on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, and at the Playboy Clubs.

In contrast to other popular stand-up comics of the era who transitioned to sitcom and movie roles, Gallagher remained mostly a touring comedian, and he once noted that he performed &quot;200 shows a year for 35 years.&quot; Per &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, he did over 3,500 live shows over the course of his career.

Running for governor (as an independent) in the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election, Gallagher finished 16th out of 135 candidates with 5,466 votes.

===Comedy style===
Proclaiming himself the &quot;Wizard of Odd,&quot; Gallagher was known for &quot;witty wordplay&quot; and sharp observational comedy, but his signature act involved the use of the &quot;Sledge-O-Matic&quot;, a large wooden mallet that he used to smash a variety of food items and other objects, culminating with a watermelon. His favored targets also included oranges, cottage cheese, pound cake, beans, cheeseburgers, tubes of toothpaste, video game controllers, and grapes. The Sledge-O-Matic act, an example of physical prop comedy, was a parody of the unintentionally humorous advertisements for the Ronco Veg-O-Matic, a kitchen tool that was heavily advertised on U.S. television from the mid-1960s through the 1970s. Gallagher&#x27;s audiences were often issued ponchos, or knew to bring raincoats, to prepare for debris cast off into the audience. He dubbed the front row of his shows &quot;Death Row&quot;. His show also featured a variety of props, including a large trampoline designed to look like a couch. Gallagher wrote his own jokes and toured with as many as 15 footlockers of props.

In July 1999, he performed a show in Cerritos, California, in which he used stereotypes that were considered offensive towards Mexicans. In January 2011, Gallagher walked out of comedian Marc Maron&#x27;s &quot;WTF&quot; podcast when Maron continued to ask Gallagher about the controversial jokes after Gallagher had responded that, out of a two-to-three-hour show, there were only five jokes, which he had &quot;heard on the street&quot;. In a subsequent interview that touched on the incident, Gallagher accused Maron of &quot;taking the other side of everything&quot;. In subsequent years, Gallagher&#x27;s routine was criticized for frequent homophobia, paranoid overtones, and racism.

In July 2012, Gallagher was featured in a television commercial for GEICO Insurance, repeating his Sledge-O-Matic routine.

Despite serious cardiac issues he experienced in his 60s and early 70s, Gallagher continued to tour until 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced him to stop.

===Sledge-O-Matic===

Though it varied from performance to performance, Gallagher would usually end each of his shows with his signature &quot;Sledge-O-Matic&quot; routine.

It traditionally began with the following preamble:

Ladies and gentlemen! I did not come here tonight just to make you laugh. I came here to sell you something and I want you to pay particular attention!

The amazing Master Tool Corporation, a subsidiary of Fly-By-Night Industries, has entrusted who? Me! To show you! The handiest and the dandiest kitchen tool you&#x27;ve ever seen. And don&#x27;t you wanna know how it works!?

Well, first you get out an ordinary apple. You place the apple between the patented pans. Then you reach for the tool that is not a slicer, is not a dicer, is not chopper in a hopper! What in the hell could it possibly be?! The Sledge-O-Matic!

Gallagher would then produce a large, usually wooden, mallet, roughly the size of a sledgehammer, and smash it down onto the apples, hurling chunks of produce into the audience. People in the first several rows were usually prepared to be splattered by opening umbrellas, wearing raincoats, or raising plastic sheeting. Fans called the experience &quot;Gallagherizing&quot;.

The entire routine was inspired by infomercials which peddled novelty household products and whose popularity peaked in the late 1970s/early 1980s before waning during the 1990s.

===Audience injuries===

On some occasions audience members sustained injuries during Gallagher&#x27;s performances.

At a show at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, California, on September 29, 1990, a woman in the audience was struck on the head by a heavy plush penguin that had a fire extinguisher inside it. She later sued the comedian for $13,000 in medical bills, $20,000 in lost wages, and punitive damages reportedly in excess of $100,000. The case went to trial in 1993, with the jury ultimately siding with Gallagher, following a raucous trial where Gallagher took the stand and reportedly got as many laughs as he would during one of his shows. The presiding judge, William Froeberg, later said &quot;... in seven years on the bench, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of characters, but none so theatrical ... It was entertaining. It certainly wasn&#x27;t boring.&quot;

At a show at the Washington County Fair in Hillsboro, Oregon, on July 8, 2010, a woman rushed the stage, slipped on debris, and was taken to the hospital for her injuries.

== Conflict with brother ==
In the early 1990s, Gallagher&#x27;s younger brother Ron asked him for permission to perform shows using Gallagher&#x27;s trademark Sledge-O-Matic routine. Leo granted his permission on the condition that Ron, who shared a strong likeness to Leo, and his manager clarified in promotional materials that it was Ron Gallagher, not Leo Gallagher, who was performing. Ron typically performed in venues smaller than those in which Leo Gallagher performed. After several years, Ron began promoting his act as Gallagher Too or Gallagher Two. In some instances, Ron&#x27;s act was promoted in a way that left unclear the fact that he was not the original Gallagher.

Leo initially responded by requesting only that his brother not use the Sledge-O-Matic routine. Ron nonetheless continued to tour as Gallagher Too using the routine. In August 2000, Leo sued his brother for trademark violations and false advertising. The courts ultimately sided with Leo, and granted an injunction prohibiting Ron from performing any act that impersonated his brother in small clubs and venues. This injunction also prohibited Ron from intentionally bearing likeness to Leo.

== Legacy ==
In 2004, Comedy Central rated Gallagher the 100th best stand-up comedian of all time. Gallagher was displeased with being ranked so low, and he told &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, &quot;I looked at the other people and I was trying to find anyone I ever heard of. How could I be behind people I never heard of? ... I made 13 one-hour shows for Showtime, which are available on videotape. I invented the one-man show on cable.&quot;

Gallagher is portrayed by Paul F. Tompkins in the 2022 movie, &quot;.&quot;

Announcing his death on November 11, 2022, his manager said that while Gallagher had his detractors, &quot;He was an undeniable talent and an American success story&quot;.

== Scientific study ==
In the 1980s, researchers at Loma Linda University used Gallagher&#x27;s comedy to study laughter&#x27;s effect on the body. Taking blood samples from ten medical school students while they watched Gallagher in action, the researchers observed the subjects&#x27; white blood cells increasing. The scientists said that laughing appeared to have boosted their immune systems.

==Personal life==
Gallagher said he lost nearly all of his fortune speculating on the stock market, and joked that he was &quot;broke&quot;. However, his long-time manager disputed this as a bit of comedic exaggeration, adding, &quot;We all need to be as broke as Leo.&quot;

During a performance on March 10, 2011, in Rochester, Minnesota, Gallagher collapsed on stage, clutching his chest. He was rushed to Saint Marys Hospital, where it was determined that he had suffered a minor heart attack.

A year later, on March 14, 2012, just before a performance in Lewisville, Texas, Gallagher began to experience intense chest pains. Gallagher&#x27;s manager said the comic suffered a &quot;mild to serious&quot; heart attack and was placed in the hospital in a medically induced coma while doctors tried to determine what was wrong with his heart. After replacing two coronary stents, doctors slowly brought him out of the coma on March 18, 2012. He quickly recovered and started talking to his family. His manager, Christine Sherrer, stated that he was breathing on his own, moving, and telling jokes.

Gallagher died in Palm Desert, California, on November 11, 2022, at the age of 76. The cause of death was organ failure.

<doc id="207586" wikidata="Q5637306" url="?curid=207586" title="Hacking Matter">
<text>Hacking Matter is a 2003 book by Wil McCarthy. It deals with &quot;programmable matter&quot; (like colloidal films, bulk crystals, and quantum dots) that, he predicts, will someday be able mimic the properties of any natural atom, and ultimately also non-natural atoms. McCarthy predicts that programmable matter will someday change human life profoundly, and that its users will have the ability to program matter itself - to change it, from a computer, from hard to soft, from paper to stone, from fluorescent to super-reflective to invisible. In his science fiction, he calls this technology &quot;Wellstone&quot;.

The book includes interviews with researchers who are developing the technology, describes how they are learning to control its electronic, optical, thermal, magnetic, and mechanical properties, and speculates on its future development.

<text>The VALIS trilogy is a set of science fiction/philosophical novels by author Philip K. Dick which include &quot;VALIS&quot; (1978), &quot;The Divine Invasion&quot; (1980), and &quot;The Transmigration of Timothy Archer&quot; (1982). Dick&#x27;s first novel about the VALIS concept originally titled &quot;VALISystem A&quot; (written 1976), was published as &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot; after Dick&#x27;s death (March 1982) in 1985.

==Background==
In February and March 1974, Dick experienced a series of visions and other inexplicable perceptual and cognitive phenomena. For the rest of his life, Dick explored the philosophical implications and hypothesized about the origins of the experience, in a journal which eventually ran to hundreds of thousands of words. This work became known as the &quot;Exegesis&quot;, selections of which were published as &quot;The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick&quot;.

Dick&#x27;s leading hypothesis was that he had been contacted by a transcendental, mystical mind he called VALIS (vast active living intelligence system).

In the summer of 1976, Dick completed a novel based on these so-called &quot;2-3-74 experiences,&quot; which he titled &quot;VALISystem A&quot;. The novel was sold to Bantam Books, but after editor Mark Hurst suggested some possible revisions, Dick began contemplating a revision so radical as to constitute a new novel. The original &quot;VALISystem A&quot; was published posthumously as &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot;.

The new version, titled simply &quot;VALIS&quot;, was completed late in 1978 and published in 1981 (the plot of the earlier version appears as the plot of a science fiction movie, also called &quot;VALIS,&quot; that the characters see). By that time, Dick had completed a second novel, one also filled with his thoughts about religion and philosophy and very indirectly linked to &quot;VALIS&quot; (the VALIS entity gets but two mentions), which he called &quot;VALIS Regained&quot; and which was published as &quot;The Divine Invasion&quot;.

Dick soon began talking (in letters and interviews) about a third novel to complete a &quot;VALIS Trilogy.&quot; After Dick&#x27;s death, several omnibus editions of the &quot;VALIS Trilogy&quot; were published, with his final mainstream novel &quot;The Transmigration of Timothy Archer&quot;. &quot;Timothy Archer&quot; does not cite VALIS, yet Dick himself called the three novels a trilogy, saying &quot;the three do form a trilogy constellating around a basic theme.&quot;

<text>Nick Rhodes (born Nicholas James Bates; 8 June 1962) is an English keyboardist and producer, best known as a founding member and the keyboardist of the band Duran Duran. He has also been the only constant member of the group since their 1978 inception. 

Rhodes has been involved in several side projects outside of, but related to, Duran Duran: he released an album with Arcadia in 1985 (featuring Duran Duran members Le Bon and Roger Taylor), and recorded and performed as the Devils in 2002 with Stephen Duffy, longtime musical friend and the original lead singer of Duran Duran. In March 2013, he released the TV Mania side project with former Duran Duran guitarist, Warren Cuccurullo.

==Early history==
Nicholas James Bates is the only child of affluent parents who were the owners of a Birmingham toy shop. He attended Woodrush High School in Wythall, north Worcestershire. Bates left school in 1978 at the age of sixteen, and founded Duran Duran with his childhood friend John Taylor (who then played lead guitar) and Taylor&#x27;s art school friend Stephen Duffy (vocals, bass, guitar). Having considered band names such as &#x27;RAF&#x27;, &#x27;Arabia&#x27;, &#x27;Industry&#x27; and &#x27;Arcadia&#x27;, they named their band after &quot;Dr. Durand Durand&quot;, Milo O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s character from the sci-fi film &quot;Barbarella&quot; the day after the movie had been broadcast by BBC 1 on 20 October 1978. The three of them made their first recordings on a cassette tape recorder above Bates&#x27; parents&#x27; toy shop and played their first gig on 5 April 1979 at Birmingham Polytechnic, and were joined by Simon Colley (clarinet and bass) soon after. In June 1979 Duran Duran opened for the band Fashion at the Barbarella&#x27;s club in Birmingham, but following the departure of Duffy and Colley reformed soon after with vocalist Andy Wickett and drummer Roger Taylor. At this point Bates&#x27; stage name was Dior Bates. After several personnel changes Duran Duran finally settled on the line-up including guitarist Andy Taylor and lead singer Simon Le Bon in May 1980 and were eventually signed to EMI.

Born Nicholas Bates, he decided to change his name for aesthetic reasons. The decision was finally made during Duran Duran&#x27;s first official interview when the journalist asked his name and he made a snap decision based upon options he had been considering, he answered Nick Rhodes and never questioned it again.
As the band coalesced into its final line-up in 1979–1980, Duran Duran started playing at a local Birmingham club called the Rum Runner. The club owners became the band&#x27;s managers, and Rhodes began working at the club as a disc jockey.

Rhodes reportedly owns the Duran Duran name; this was mentioned in the Andy Warhol diaries. In the entry for October 5, 1986, Warhol told his diarist Pat Hackett: &quot;One of the Taylors isn&#x27;t in the group anymore but Nick owns the name so it&#x27;s still Duran Duran.&quot; In 1986, Andy and Roger Taylor left the band, returning in 2001 to reunite and create the &quot;Astronaut&quot; album.

==Contributions to Duran Duran==
The band achieved rapid success, and Rhodes was a driving force throughout. An unschooled musician, he experimented with the sounds his analogue synthesisers were capable of, but shied away from the &quot;novelty&quot; sounds of some other early synth bands. The distinctive warble of &quot;Save a Prayer&quot;, the keyboard stabs of &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, and the string sounds of &quot;Come Undone&quot; and &quot;Ordinary World&quot; are some of his most recognisable creations, as well as the futuristic oscillating synth that characterised Duran Duran&#x27;s self-titled first album. He popularised the Crumar Performer on the early records.

Rhodes was also quick to recognise the potential of the music video, and pushed the band to put more effort into their early videos than seemed warranted at the time (before the advent of MTV). Barely twenty when the band hit major stardom, he cultivated an androgynous and sometimes flamboyant image, wore heavy makeup, and changed his hair colour at whim. By the late 1990s, Rhodes had begun writing lyrics for Duran Duran, as well as music. His digitally altered voice is heard on the title track to the 1997 album &quot;Medazzaland&quot;.

==Record production==

Rhodes studied production techniques while in the studio with Duran Duran, eventually helping to mix several tracks on the &quot;Rio&quot; album, and was a co-producer on many of the band&#x27;s later albums.

In early 1983, he discovered the band Kajagoogoo and co-produced their debut single &quot;Too Shy&quot; which became a UK no. 1 (prior to any of Duran&#x27;s singles reaching no. 1).

Rhodes and Warren Cuccurullo wrote and produced three tracks for the Blondie reunion album in 1996; the tracks were not used, but one song called &quot;Pop Trash Movie&quot; was later recorded by Duran Duran for the 2000 album &quot;Pop Trash&quot;.

In 2002, Rhodes co-produced and played additional synthesizers in nine tracks of the album &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot; by the Dandy Warhols. In 2004 he produced British-based pop group Riviera F for their debut EP &quot;International Lover&quot;, published on Pop Cult/Tape Modern (Rhodes&#x27; &amp; Stephen Duffy&#x27;s label).

==Side projects==

With Le Bon, Rhodes formed the side project Arcadia while Duran Duran was on hiatus in 1985. The band had a moody, keyboard-heavy sound, far more atmospheric than Duran Duran (or the hard rock of the other Duran splinter group of 1985 [John and Andy Taylor], the Power Station).

The band scored a major hit with &quot;Election Day&quot; and the band&#x27;s only album, &quot;So Red the Rose&quot;, went platinum in the US but was less successful in their native UK. The band never toured and was dissolved when Duran Duran regrouped in 1986. In 1999, Rhodes reunited with Duran Duran&#x27;s original vocalist, Stephen Duffy, to create new music based on some of the earliest Duran music the two had written together. The result was the album &quot;Dark Circles&quot;, released under the name the Devils. Also in 1999, Rhodes had a small guest appearance (in voice only) as a Canadian bomber pilot in &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;.

In 2006 Rhodes and John Taylor collaborated on the compilation album &quot;Only After Dark&quot;. In 2011 Rhodes along with Andrew Wyatt and Mark Ronson remixed Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; for the British electronic band&#x27;s remix compilation &quot;Remixes 2: 81–11&quot;. Also in 2011, Rhodes wrote the afterword to the award-winning &#x27;80s 7-inch vinyl cover art book &quot;Put the Needle on the Record&quot;.

In March 2013, TV Mania made up of Rhodes and ex-Duran Duran guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, released &quot;Bored with Prozac and the Internet?&quot;. Throughout the 1990s, Rhodes worked on this side project with Cuccurullo. To support the launch of the project, Rhodes had an exhibition of his photography, BEI INCUBI (Beautiful Nightmares) at the Vinyl Factory in Chelsea, London on 7 March 2013.

In 2021, Rhodes collaborated with Stewart Bevan&#x27;s daughter Wendy Bevan on the series of &quot;Astronomia&quot; albums.

In 2022, Rhodes collaborated with Rob Crow, Roy Mayorga, Aaron Tanner, and more on a cover of the Residents&#x27; song, &quot;Mahogany Wood&quot;.

==Personal life==
Rhodes met Julie Anne Friedman (heiress to the Younkers Department Store fortune) at a yacht party while on an American tour in 1982, and married her on 18 August 1984. They have one daughter together, Tatjana Lee Orchid (born 23 August 1986). After a brief separation and an attempt to reconcile, they filed for divorce in 1992. Rhodes has had several long relationships with various women but has not remarried.

Rhodes, as a former art student, became enamoured with the art world early in his career, making friends with pop-art artist Andy Warhol and the Factory crowd, and attending exhibitions worldwide. At the end of 1984, he released his own book of abstract art photographs called &quot;Interference&quot;. Many of the photos were displayed at an exhibition at the Hamilton Gallery in London. He continues to showcase photography on occasion, including in British magazines such as &quot;Tatler&quot; and also occasionally appears at the Cannes International Film Festival.

In November 2011, Rhodes received an Honorary Doctorate of Arts degree from the University of Bedfordshire, for his services to the music industry. Rhodes appears in Burke&#x27;s Peerage under his second cousin&#x27;s entry for the family of Lindley-Highfield of Ballumbie Castle, being related to the Highfield family through his paternal grandmother, Irene Lavinia Bates (née Highfield).

Rhodes is a long-time vegetarian, occasionally a pescatarian. In a 2012 interview for the official Duran Duran website he cited Italian, Lebanese, and Indian food as his favourites. He moved to central London two years after Duran Duran&#x27;s success and continues to reside there.

<text>Richard Claxton Gregory (October 12, 1932 – August 19, 2017) was an American comedian, actor, writer, activist and social critic. His books were bestsellers. Gregory became popular among the African-American communities in the southern United States with his &quot;no-holds-barred&quot; sets, poking fun at the bigotry and racism in the United States. In 1961 he became a staple in the comedy clubs, appeared on television, and released comedy record albums.

Gregory was at the forefront of political activism in the 1960s, when he protested against the Vietnam War and racial injustice, and advocated for animal rights. He was arrested multiple times and went on many hunger strikes. He later became a speaker and author. Gregory died of heart failure, aged 84, at a Washington, D.C., hospital in August 2017.

== Early life ==
Gregory was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Lucille, a house cleaner, and Presley Gregory. At Sumner High School, he was aided by teachers, among them Warren St. James; he also excelled at running, winning the state cross-country championship in 1950. Gregory earned a track scholarship to Southern Illinois University (SIU), where he set school records as a half-miler and miler. He was named the university&#x27;s outstanding student athlete of the year in 1953. He was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. In 1954, his college career was interrupted for two years when he was drafted into the United States Army. At the urging of his commanding officer, who had taken notice of his penchant for joking, Gregory got his start in comedy in the Army, where he entered and won several talent shows. In 1956, Gregory briefly returned to SIU after his discharge, but dropped out because he felt that the university &quot;didn&#x27;t want me to study, they wanted me to run.&quot;

In the hopes of becoming a professional comedian, Gregory moved to Chicago, where he became part of a new generation of black comedians that included Nipsey Russell, Bill Cosby, and Godfrey Cambridge, all of whom broke with the minstrel tradition that presented blacks stereotypically. Gregory drew on current events, especially racial issues, for much of his material: &quot;Segregation is not all bad. Have you ever heard of a collision where the people in the back of the bus got hurt?&quot;

== Career ==

=== 1956–1964: Comedy career ===
Gregory started helping his family with the gigs he started to get at a young age. Gregory began his career as a comedian while serving in the military in the mid-1950s. He served in the Army for a year and a half at Fort Cavazos, formerly known as Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Lee in Virginia, and Fort Smith in Arkansas. He was drafted in 1954 while attending Southern Illinois University. After being discharged in 1956, he returned to the university but did not receive a degree. He moved to Chicago with a desire to perform comedy professionally. In 1958, Gregory opened the Apex Club nightclub in Illinois. The club failed and landed Gregory in financial hardship. In 1959, Gregory landed a job as master of ceremonies at the Roberts Show Club.

While working for the United States Postal Service during the daytime, Gregory performed as a comedian in small, primarily black-patronized nightclubs of the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit. In an interview with &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, Gregory described the history of black comics as limited: &quot;Blacks could sing and dance in the white night clubs but weren&#x27;t allowed to stand flat-footed and talk to white folks, which is what a comic does.&quot;

In 1961, Gregory was working at the black-owned Roberts Show Bar in Chicago when he was spotted by Hugh Hefner.

Gregory attributed the launch of his career to Hefner. Based on his performance at Roberts Show Bar, Hefner hired Gregory to work at the Chicago Playboy Club as a replacement for comedian &quot;Professor&quot; Irwin Corey.

In 1961, Gregory made his New York debut at The Blue Angel nightclub, also recording a live set there, &quot;Dick Gregory at the Blue Angel&quot; for his album &quot;East &amp; West&quot;. He soon came back to Chicago and finally got his big break at the Playboy Club in Chicago, also in 1961, that was supposed to be one night and ended up being six weeks and earned him a spot in &quot;Time&quot; and a guest appearance on Jack Paar’s show and other night clubs shows, etc.

Gregory&#x27;s comedy occasioned controversy in some conservative white circles. The administration of the University of Tennessee, for instance, branded Gregory an &quot;extreme racist&quot; whose &quot;appearance would be an outrage and an insult to many citizens of this state&quot;, and revoked his invitation by students to speak on campus. The students sued, with noted litigator William Kunstler as their counsel, and in &quot;Smith v. University of Tennessee&quot;, 300 F. Supp. 777 (E.D. Tenn. 1969), won an order from the court that the university&#x27;s policy was &quot;too broad and vague&quot;. The University of Tennessee then implemented an &quot;open speaker&quot; system, and Gregory subsequently performed in April 1970.

In 1964, Gregory&#x27;s book, &quot;&quot;, was published. Since then, the book has never been out of print. In 2019 a trade paperback was published as well as an audio version. Gregory was number 82 on Comedy Central&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Stand-ups&quot; of all time and had his own star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

=== 1967–1969: Political career ===
Gregory began his political career by running against Richard J. Daley for Mayor of Chicago in 1967. Though he did not win, this would not prove to be the end of his participation in electoral politics.

Gregory ran for president in the 1968 United States presidential election as a write-in candidate of the Freedom and Peace Party, which had broken off from the Peace and Freedom Party. He garnered 47,097 votes, including one from Hunter S. Thompson, with fellow activist Mark Lane as his running mate in some states. His running mate in New Jersey was Dr. David Frost of Plainfield, a biologist, Rutgers professor, and Chairman of NJ SANE (Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy). Famed pediatrician Dr. Benjamin Spock was the running mate in Virginia and Pennsylvania garnering more than the party he had left. The Freedom and Peace Party also ran other candidates, including Beulah Sanders for the New York State Senate and Flora Brown for the New York State Assembly. Gregory&#x27;s efforts landed him on the master list of Nixon&#x27;s political opponents.

Gregory then wrote the book &quot;Write Me In&quot; about his presidential campaign. One anecdote in the book relates the story of a publicity stunt that came out of Operation Breadbasket in Chicago. The campaign had printed one-dollar bills with Gregory&#x27;s image on them, some of which made it into circulation. The majority of these bills were quickly seized by the federal government, much in part to the bills resembling authentic US currency enough to work in many dollar-cashing machines of the day. Gregory avoided being charged with a federal crime, later joking that the bills could not really be considered United States currency, because &quot;everyone knows a black man will never be on a U.S. bill.&quot; On October 15, 1969, Gregory spoke at the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam demonstration in Washington, D.C., where he joked to the crowd: &quot;The President says nothing you kids do will have any effect on him. Well, I suggest he make one long-distance call to the LBJ ranch&quot;.

=== 1970–2013: Post-standup career ===
He was a co-host with radio personality Cathy Hughes, and was a frequent morning guest, on WOL 1450 AM talk radio&#x27;s &quot;The Power&quot;, the flagship station of Hughes&#x27; Radio One. He also appeared regularly on the nationally syndicated &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; program.

Gregory appeared as &quot;Mr. Sun&quot; on the television show &quot;Wonder Showzen&quot; (the third episode, entitled &quot;Ocean&quot;, aired in 2005). As Chauncey, a puppet character, imbibes a hallucinogenic substance, Mr. Sun warns: &quot;Don&#x27;t get hooked on imagination, Chauncey. It can lead to terrible, horrible things.&quot; Gregory also provided guest commentary on the &quot;Wonder Showzen&quot; Season One DVD. Large segments of his commentary were intentionally bleeped out, including the names of several dairy companies, as he made potentially defamatory remarks concerning ill effects that the consumption of cow milk has on human beings. Gregory attended and spoke at the funeral of James Brown on December 30, 2006, in Augusta, Georgia. Gregory was an occasional guest on the Mark Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Make It Plain&quot; Sirius Channel 146 Radio Show from 3 pm to 6 pm PST. Gregory appeared on &quot;The Alex Jones Show&quot; on September 14, 2010, March 19, 2012, and April 1, 2014.

Gregory gave the keynote address for Black History Month at Bryn Mawr College on February 28, 2013.
His take-away message to the students was to never accept injustice.

Towards the end of his life, he was featured in a Fantagraphics book by Pat Thomas entitled &quot;Listen, Whitey: The Sights and Sounds of Black Power 1965–1975&quot;, which uses the political recordings of the Civil Rights era to highlight sociopolitical meanings throughout the movement. Gregory is known for comedic performances that not only made people laugh, but mocked the establishment. According to Thomas, Gregory&#x27;s monologues reflect a time when entertainment needed to be political to be relevant, which is why he included his standup in the collection. Gregory is featured along with the likes of Malcolm X, Huey P. Newton, Jesse Jackson, Martin Luther King Jr., Langston Hughes and Bill Cosby.

==Political activism==
=== Anti-Apartheid ===
On July 21, 1979, Gregory appeared at the Amandla Festival in Boston, where Bob Marley, Patti LaBelle, and Eddie Palmieri, among others, performed. Gregory gave a speech before Marley&#x27;s performance, blaming President Jimmy Carter, and showing his support for the international Anti-Apartheid Movement.

=== Civil rights movement ===
Gregory was active in the civil rights movement. On October 7, 1963, he came to Selma, Alabama, and spoke for two hours on a public platform two days before the voter registration drive known as &quot;Freedom Day&quot; (October 7, 1963).

In 1964, Gregory became more involved in civil rights activities, activism against the Vietnam War, economic reform, and anti-drug issues. As a part of his activism, he went on several hunger strikes and campaigns in America and overseas. In the early 1970s, he was banned from Australia, where government officials feared he would &quot;...stir up demonstrations against the Vietnam war.&quot;

In 1964, Gregory played a role in the search for three missing civil rights workers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, who vanished in Philadelphia, Mississippi. After Gregory and members of CORE met with Neshoba County Sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey, Gregory became convinced that the Sheriff&#x27;s office was complicit. With cash provided by Hugh Hefner, Gregory announced a $25,000 reward for information. The FBI, which had been criticized for inaction, eventually followed suit with its own reward, and the rewards worked. The bodies of the three men were found by the FBI 44 days after they disappeared.

At a civil rights rally marking the 40th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Gregory criticized the United States, calling it &quot;the most dishonest, ungodly, unspiritual nation that ever existed in the history of the planet. As we talk now, America is 5 percent of the world&#x27;s population and consumes 96 percent of the world&#x27;s hard drugs&quot;.

=== Feminism ===
Gregory was an outspoken feminist, and in 1978 joined Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan, Bella Abzug, Margaret Heckler, Barbara Mikulski, and others to lead the National ERA March for Ratification and Extension, a march down Pennsylvania Avenue to the United States Capitol. Gregory was invited to join the march by actress and activist Susan Blakely. There were over 100,000 on Women&#x27;s Equality Day (August 26), 1978, to demonstrate for a ratification deadline extension for the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution, and for the ratification of the ERA. The march was ultimately successful in extending the deadline to June 30, 1982, and Gregory joined other activists to the Senate for celebration and victory speeches by pro-ERA Senators, members of Congress, and activists. The ERA narrowly failed to be ratified by the extended ratification date.

=== JFK assassination ===
Gregory became an outspoken critic of the findings of the Warren Commission concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald. On February 3, 1975, in Washington, D.C., Gregory introduced photographic forensic investigator Stephen Jaffe and assassination researchers Robert J. Groden and Ralph Schoenman to the members and lawyers for the presidential commission known as the Rockefeller Commission who gave testimony and presented evidence. A month later, on March 6, 1975, Gregory and researcher Robert J. Groden appeared on Geraldo Rivera&#x27;s late night ABC talk show &quot;Goodnight America&quot;. An important historical event happened that night when the famous Zapruder film of JFK&#x27;s assassination was shown to the public on TV for the first time. The public&#x27;s outraged response to its showing led to the Hart-Schweiker investigation, which contributed to the Church Committee Investigation on Intelligence Activities by the United States, which in turn resulted in the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations investigation.

=== Martin Luther King, Jr. ===
Gregory and Mark Lane conducted landmark research into the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., helping move the U.S. House Select Assassinations Committee to investigate the murder, along with that of John F. Kennedy. Lane was the author of conspiracy theory books such as &quot;Rush to Judgment&quot;. The pair wrote the King conspiracy book &quot;Code Name Zorro&quot;, which postulated that convicted assassin James Earl Ray did not act alone.

In 1998, Gregory spoke at the celebration of the birthday of Dr Martin Luther King Jr., with President Bill Clinton in attendance. Not long after, the President told Gregory&#x27;s long-time friend and public relations consultant Steve Jaffe, &quot;I love Dick Gregory; he is one of the funniest people on the planet.&quot; They spoke of how Gregory had made a comment on Dr. King&#x27;s birthday that broke everyone into laughter when he noted that the President made Speaker Newt Gingrich ride &quot;in the back of the plane,&quot; on an Air Force One trip overseas.

=== Other conspiracy theories ===
Gregory also argued that the Moon landing was faked and the commonly accepted account of the 9/11 attacks was inaccurate, among other conspiracy theories.

=== Native American rights ===
In 1966, Gregory and his wife were arrested for illegal net fishing alongside the Nisqually people in Washington state in a protest fish-in. The tribe was protesting against the state laws that ban forms of fishing other than hook-and-line because it barred their rights guaranteed to them through a federal treaty that allowed them to fish in their traditional ways. He was later released from jail in Olympia, Washington, after six weeks of fasting to call attention to the violation of Native American treaties by the United States government.

=== US Embassy hostage crisis in Iran ===
Gregory was an outspoken activist during the US Embassy hostage crisis in Iran. In 1980, he traveled to Tehran to attempt to negotiate the hostages&#x27; release and engaged in a public hunger strike there, weighing less than 100 pounds (45 kg) when he returned to the United States.

=== Vegetarianism and animal rights ===
Gregory became a vegetarian and fasting activist in 1965 &quot;based on the philosophy of nonviolence practiced during the Civil Rights Movement.&quot; His 1973 book, &quot;Dick Gregory&#x27;s Natural Diet For Folks Who Eat: Cookin&#x27; with Mother Nature&quot;, outlined how fasting and eating vegetarian led to dramatic weight loss. He developed a diet drink called Bahamian Diet Nutritional Drink and went on TV shows to advocate his diet to help the morbidly obese. He wrote the introduction to Viktoras Kulvinskas&#x27; book &quot;Survival into the 21st Century&quot;. A talk he gave at Amherst College in 1986 inspired Tracye McQuirter to become a vegan activist.

In 1984, he founded Health Enterprises, Inc., a company that distributed weight-loss products. With this company, Gregory made efforts to improve the life expectancy of African Americans, which he believed was being hindered by poor nutrition and drug and alcohol abuse. In 1985, Gregory introduced the Slim-Safe Bahamian Diet, a powdered diet compound. He launched the weight-loss powder at the Whole Life Expo in Boston under the slogan &quot;It&#x27;s cool to be healthy.&quot; The diet compound, if drunk three times a day, was said to prompt rapid weight loss. Gregory received a multimillion-dollar distribution contract to retail the diet.

In 1985, the Ethiopian government adopted, to reported success, Gregory&#x27;s formula to combat malnutrition during a period of famine in the country. Gregory&#x27;s clients included Muhammad Ali. In 1987, he helped Walter Hudson, then the fattest person alive, lose nearly in the span of one year.

In 2003, Gregory and Cornel West wrote letters on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to Kentucky Fried Chicken&#x27;s CEO, asking that the company improve its animal-handling procedures.

Gregory saw civil rights and animal rights as intrinsically linked, once stating, &quot;Because I&#x27;m a civil rights activist, I am also an animal rights activist. Animals and humans suffer and die alike. Violence causes the same pain, the same spilling of blood, the same stench of death, the same arrogant, cruel and vicious taking of life. We shouldn&#x27;t be a part of it.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Gregory met his future wife Lillian Smith at an African-American club; they married in 1959. They had 11 children (including one son, Richard Jr., who died two months after birth): Michele, Lynne, Pamela, Paula, Xenobia (Stephanie), Gregory, Christian, Miss, Ayanna, and Yohance. In a 2000 interview with &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Gregory was quoted as saying, &quot;People ask me about being a father and not being there. I say, &#x27;Jack the Ripper had a father. Hitler had a father. Don&#x27;t talk to me about family.

=== Health and death ===
Gregory was diagnosed with lymphoma in late 1999. He said he was treating the cancer with herbs, vitamins, and exercise, which he believed kept the cancer in remission.

Gregory died from heart failure at a hospital in Washington, D.C., on August 19, 2017, at the age of 84. A week prior to his death, he was hospitalized with a bacterial infection.

<doc id="207594" wikidata="Q432348" url="?curid=207594" title="Cornelius Cole">
<text>Cornelius Cole (September 17, 1822 – November 3, 1924) was an American politician who served a single term in the United States House of Representatives as a Republican representing California from 1863 to 1865, and another term in the United States Senate from 1867 to 1873. Cole, who died at the age of , is the longest-lived U.S. Senator.

==Early life and education==
Cornelius Cole was born in Lodi, New York on September 17, 1822. He received his education at local common schools, Ovid Academy in Ovid, Lima Seminary in Lima, and Hobart College in Geneva. He graduated from Wesleyan University of Middletown, Connecticut in 1847, studied law with William H. Seward, and was admitted to the bar in 1848. After a year mining gold in California, in 1849 he began to practice law, first in San Francisco, then in Sacramento.

== Political career ==
On March 8, 1856, Cole was one of the organizers of the California branch of the Republican Party, acting as secretary and writing its initial manifesto. He served on the Republican National Committee from 1856 to 1860. From August 1856 to January 1857, Cole and James McClatchy edited the &quot;Sacramento Daily Times&quot;.

Additionally, he was nominated on the Republican ticket for Clerk of Sacramento Court but was unsuccessful. In 1858 he was elected District Attorney of Sacramento County. In 1862 he and his family moved to Santa Cruz. During the American Civil War, Cole supported the Union. In 1863, he was commissioned as a captain after winning an election to command the Santa Cruz Cavalry Troop, a unit he helped raise for the California Militia. He did actively command because he had been elected to Congress.

In 1862, Cole was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Union Republican, and he served one term, March 4 1863 to March 3, 1865. On November 19, 1863, Cole traveled to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania with Abraham Lincoln. He was on the speaker&#x27;s platform near Lincoln, and both heard and saw him deliver the Gettysburg Address. On April 14, 1865, Cole spoke with Lincoln a few hours before Lincoln was assassinated.

In 1865, he was elected to the United States Senate, serving one term from March 4, 1867 to March 3, 1873. During his final two years as a senator, Cole served as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He was also one of the senators who voted in favor of the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson.

== Later life ==

After returning to California following his retirement from politics, he practiced law in San Francisco and Los Angeles. In 1880, he moved to Colegrove, where he lived in retirement. Cole was the founder of Colegrove, a settlement he created on land that had been part of Rancho La Brea; he acquired the land from owner Henry Hancock as payment for helping Hancock confirm title to Rancho La Brea. Colegrove was named for Cole&#x27;s wife, and several streets were named for his children, including Willoughby Avenue, Eleanor Street and Seward Street.

== Death and burial ==
Cole died of pneumonia in Los Angeles on November 3, 1924. He was buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

At age 102, Cole is the longest-lived U.S. Senator.

==Family==
In January 1853, Cole married Olive Colegrove of Trumansburg, New York. They were the parents of nine children.

Cole&#x27;s brother, George W. Cole, was a Union Army officer in the American Civil War who attained the rank of major general by brevet. After the war, George Cole was acquitted of the murder of L. Harris Hiscock, whom he accused of having an affair with Mrs. Cole.

<text>Cornell George Hopley Woolrich ( ; December 4, 1903 – September 25, 1968) was an American novelist and short story writer. He sometimes used the pseudonyms William Irish and George Hopley.

His biographer, Francis Nevins Jr., rated Woolrich the fourth best crime writer of his day, behind Dashiell Hammett, Erle Stanley Gardner and Raymond Chandler.

==Biography==
Woolrich was born in New York City. His parents separated when he was young, and he lived for a time in Mexico with his father before returning to New York to live with his mother, Claire Attalie Woolrich.

He attended Columbia University but left in 1926 without graduating when his first novel, &quot;Cover Charge&quot;, was published. As Eddie Duggan observes, &quot;Woolrich enrolled at New York&#x27;s Columbia University in 1921 where he spent a relatively undistinguished year until he was taken ill and was laid up for some weeks. It was during this illness (a &quot;Rear Window&quot;–like confinement involving a gangrenous foot, according to one version of the story) that Woolrich started writing, producing &quot;Cover Charge&quot;, which was published in 1926.&quot; &quot;Cover Charge&quot; was one of his Jazz Age novels inspired by the work of F. Scott Fitzgerald. A second short story, &quot;Children of the Ritz&quot;, won Woolrich the first prize of $10,000 the following year in a competition organised by College Humor and First National Pictures; this led to his working as a screenwriter in Hollywood for First National Pictures. While in Hollywood, Woolrich explored his sexuality, apparently engaging in what Francis M. Nevins Jr. describes as &quot;promiscuous and clandestine homosexual activity&quot; and by marrying Violet Virginia Blackton, the 21-year-old daughter of J. Stuart Blackton, one of the founders of the Vitagraph studio. Failing in both his attempt at marriage and at establishing a career as a screenwriter (the unconsummated marriage was annulled in 1933; Woolrich garnered no screen credits), Woolrich sought to resume his life as a novelist:
When he turned to pulp and detective fiction, Woolrich&#x27;s output was so prolific his work was often published under one of his many pseudonyms. For example, &quot;William Irish&quot; was the byline in &quot;Dime Detective Magazine&quot; (February 1942) on his 1942 story &quot;It Had to Be Murder&quot;, source of the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock movie &quot;Rear Window&quot; and itself based on H.G. Wells&#x27; short story &quot;Through a Window&quot;. François Truffaut filmed Woolrich&#x27;s &quot;The Bride Wore Black&quot; and &quot;Waltz into Darkness&quot; in 1968 and 1969, respectively, the latter as &quot;Mississippi Mermaid&quot;. Ownership of the copyright in Woolrich&#x27;s original story &quot;It Had to Be Murder&quot; and its use for &quot;Rear Window&quot; was litigated before the US Supreme Court in &quot;Stewart v. Abend&quot;, 495 U.S. 207 (1990).

He returned to New York, where he and his mother moved into the Hotel Marseilles (Broadway and West 103rd Street on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side). Eddie Duggan observes that &quot;[a]lthough his writing made him wealthy, Woolrich and his mother lived in a series of seedy hotel rooms, including the squalid Hotel Marseilles apartment building in Harlem [sic], among a group of thieves, prostitutes and lowlifes that would not be out of place in Woolrich&#x27;s dark fictional world.&quot; Woolrich lived there until his mother&#x27;s death on October 6, 1957, which prompted his move to the slightly more upscale Hotel Franconia (20 West 72nd Street near Central Park). Duggan wrote:
In later years, he socialized on occasion in Manhattan bars with Mystery Writers of America colleagues and younger fans such as writer Ron Goulart. He moved later to the Sheraton-Russell on Park Avenue and became a virtual recluse. In his 60s, with his eyesight failing, lonely, wracked by guilt over his homosexuality, tortured by self-doubt, alcoholic and a diabetic, Woolrich neglected himself to such a degree that he allowed a foot infection to become gangrenous which resulted, early in 1968, in the amputation of a leg.

After the amputation and a conversion to Catholicism, Woolrich returned to the Sheraton-Russell, requiring the use of a wheelchair. Some of the staff there would take Woolrich down to the lobby so he could look out on the passing traffic.

Woolrich did not attend the premiere of Truffaut&#x27;s film of his novel &quot;The Bride Wore Black&quot; in 1968, even though it was held in New York City. He died September 25, 1968.

Woolrich bequeathed his estate of about $850,000 to Columbia University to endow scholarships in his mother&#x27;s memory for writing students. His papers are also kept at the Columbia University Libraries.

==Bibliography==
Most of Woolrich&#x27;s books are out of print, and new editions were slow to come out because of estate issues. However, new collections of his short stories were issued in the early 1990s. As of February 3, 2020, the Faded Page has seven titles available as ebooks in the public domain in Canada; these may be still under copyright elsewhere. In 2020 and 2021, Otto Penzler&#x27;s &quot;American Mystery Classics&quot; series released new editions of &quot;Waltz into Darkness&quot; and &quot;The Bride Wore Black&quot; in both hardcover and paperback. In January 2025, a ebook complete novels edition for countries where his work falls in the public domain has been released by Delphi Classics.

Woolrich died leaving fragments of an unfinished novel, titled &quot;The Loser&quot;; fragments have been published separately and also collected in &quot;Tonight, Somewhere in New York&quot; (2005).

<text>San Pedro Sula () is the capital of Cortés Department, Honduras. It is located in the northwest corner of the country in the Sula Valley, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of Puerto Cortés on the Caribbean Sea. With a population of 701,200 in the central urban area (2023 calculation) and a population of 1,445,598 in its metropolitan area in 2023, it is the nation&#x27;s primary industrial center and second largest city after the capital Tegucigalpa, and the largest city in Central America that is not a capital city.

==History==
Before the arrival of the Spanish, the Sula Valley was home to approximately 50,000 native inhabitants. The area that is home to the modern city served as a local trade hub for the Mayan and Aztec civilizations. The Spanish conquest brought about a demographic collapse from which the native population would never recover.

On 27 June 1536, Don Pedro de Alvarado founded a Spanish town beside the Indian settlement of Choloma, with the name of Villa de Señor San Pedro de Puerto Caballos (modern San Pedro Sula). The new town had 35 Spanish citizens, and Alvarado allocated 200 of his slaves to help build the new town and work the surrounding fields. He sent out expeditions into outlying regions to secure the new town, extend the area of Spanish domination, and commandeer supplies. Alvarado annulled all encomienda rights established in the area under Andres de Cerezeda, and reassigned the villages to the citizens of San Pedro.

The new settlement barely survived the colonial period. In 1601, the Spanish government declared Santo Tomás as the official port for the Central American colonies; this move diverted exports from Puerto Cortés and resulted in an economic decline that would last through the 17th century. Additionally, San Pedro Sula was left exposed to raids by pirates and French, Dutch, and English mercenaries. By the mid-18th century, the Spanish government decided to build a number of coastal fortresses to curb English attacks. One of these fortresses, the Fortaleza de San Fernando, was built in Omoa, less than 50 miles from San Pedro Sula. The subsequent increase in trade supported an increase in population from 70 inhabitants in 1714 to 357 in 1789.

Post-independence San Pedro Sula remained an impoverished village, dependent on trade between Omoa and the country&#x27;s interior. In 1875, Frank Frye, the American consul in the Bay Islands, reported a population of 1200. The city benefitted from the growth of the banana trade in the 1870s and 1880s and formed a close relationship with US-based shipper and railroad entrepreneur Samuel Zemurray&#x27;s Cuyamel Fruit Company, and the construction of the Interoceanic Railroad between 1869 and 1874 which connected the city to the coast at Puerto Cortés. Zemurray worked closely with local elites who invested in subsidiary enterprises and thus shaped the way politically for Cuyamel to establish itself and pay very few taxes.

==Economy==
In 2013, fifteen years after the effects of Hurricane Mitch, Honduras is one of the poorest countries in Latin America; around San Pedro Sula, banana production has not fully recovered, and &quot;manufacturing has all but dried up.&quot; The problems are exacerbated by organized gangs, whose rules prevent residents from safely leaving gang-controlled neighborhoods such as Chamelecón for jobs in other parts of town.

In 2000, then-Mayor Roberto Larios Silva said &quot;San Pedro Sula is where the economic development of the country is concentrated via the city&#x27;s industrial, commercial, and financial development.&quot; The then-manager of Hotel Copantl attributed its growth in business-related tourism ...[to] the maquila (apparel 
manufacturing) industry.

, San Pedro Sula generated two-thirds of the country&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP).
==Crime==
San Pedro Sula was the &quot;murder capital of the world&quot; until early 2016 when Caracas, Venezuela, surpassed its homicide rate. Since the 2009 Honduran military coup &quot;unemployment and underemployment rates have doubled while the number of people living in extreme poverty has skyrocketed.&quot; In 2013, the city had 187 homicides per 100,000 residents, surpassing the 148 per 100,000 of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The latter had previously topped the list for three consecutive years, with about three homicides per day. Both cities are major operational and strategic distribution points in the illegal drug trade, particularly to the United States, and have significant gang activity. In response, authorities launched Operation Lightning, saturating violence hotspots with police and soldiers. Meanwhile, arms trafficking has flooded the country, with just under 70% of all firearms being illegal. 83% of homicides in the city involve firearms.

According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;the homicide rate is stoked by the rivalry of the brutal street gangs, mostly descendants of gangs formed in Los Angeles and deported to Central America in the 1990s, including Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and the 18th Street gang. Their ranks are fed by the disastrous economy of Honduras, and emboldened more recently by alliances with Mexican drug traffickers moving cocaine through the country.&quot;

Crime and economic stress have led to the migration of large numbers of unaccompanied minors to the US border. The latest data from the CBP shows San Pedro Sula as the major source for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) migrating from Honduras.

==Geography==
===Climate===
San Pedro Sula features has a tropical wet and dry climate (&quot;Aw&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification, with a dry season spanning from January through May and a wet season covering the remaining months. The city experiences relatively high temperatures year-round and some rainfall. However, it does not quite fall under the tropical monsoon climate category. San Pedro Sula has experienced hurricanes and tropical storms and is prone to them during the hurricane season usually when the storms form in the southern part of the Caribbean or Western Africa.

==Administrative divisions==

San Pedro Sula, as most cities built under the Spanish colonial period, is divided in quadrants.
Avenues in the city run from north to south and streets run from east to west. First Street and First Avenue mark the &quot;center of the city&quot; and effectively divide it into four major quadrants NW, NE, SW and SE.

===Southwest===
Barrio El Benque, the business district, is just to the west and south of the center, and other neighborhoods in the suroeste include Barrio Paz Barahona, Barrio La Guardia, Colonia Altamira, Colonia Mesetas, Barrio Río de Piedras, Barrio Suyapa (from 12 Avenida S out to Avenida Circunvalación, from 7 Calle S to 10 Calles S), Colonia Hernandez, Barrio Prado Alto, and Colonia El Chamelecón. The latter includes area from 23 Avenida S west to 27 Avenida S, from 1 Calle (named Bulevar Los Próceres there) south to 5 Calle S0. To the south of Colonia El Chamelecón are Colonia Dubón, Colonia Figueroa, Colonia Trejo (from 10 Calle S to 12 Calle S, from about Avenida Circunvalación to 25 Avenida S, including the Consulate of Nicaragua), Colonia Altamira, and Colonia Altiplano. Colonia Las Mesetas runs from 12 Calle S to 14 Calle S, from 21 Avenida A (S) to past 24 Avenida S.

===Northwest===
Barrio Guamilito is just to the west and north of the center. Noroeste neighborhoods include Colonia Moderna (from 1 Calle to 5 Calle NO, from Avendia Circunvalación to the river beyond 24 Avenida), Colonia La Mora (from 5 Calle NO to 7 Calle NO, from Avendia Circunvalación to the río beyond 24 Avenida), Colonia Zeron, the Colonia Columbia by the Universidad de San Pedro Sula, Barrio La Cervecería and Barrio Guadalupe. Across the river along which 24 Avenida runs is Colonia Juan Lindo and Colonia Jardines Del Valle.

From the river past 24 Avenida, north to 25 Calle and west to 12 Avenida, is Colonia Universidad. Universidad de San Pedro Sula is to its south, across the river. West of Colonia Universidad is Colonia Country, a small neighborhood including the Academia Americana, and Colonia Villas del Sol, which runs from Boulevard Mackey west to include Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Honduras en el Valle de Sula, and goes north to Río Bermejo but does not cross it.

Just past the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras en el Valle de Sula, and spanning the Río Bermejo, is Colonia El Pedregal, which has residential high-rises.

Further out, north across the Río Bermejo, running to the edge of the city, and with calles (streets) renumbering from 1 up, are Colonia Los Alpes and Rancho El Coco and Residencial Los Cedros and Colonia La Tara.

Far to the north is Colonia Fesitranh.

===Northeast===
Barrio Las Acacias is just to the north of center. Nor-Este neighborhoods include Barrio San Cristobal, Villa Florencia, Colonia Ideal, Barrio Morazán, Colonia Modelo, and further out Colonia Bográn, Colonia El Carmen, and Colonia Los Laureles.

===Southeast===
Includes the road to the airport, Aeropuerto Internacional Ramon Villeda Morales and to the city of La Lima. Southeast neighborhoods include Barrio Medina (11 Calle SE to Avenida Juan Pablo II, 4 Avenida SO to 10 Avenida SE), Colonia La Aurora (defined by 7 Calle SE to 10 Calle SE, and 14 Avenida SE to Segundo Anilo (approximately where 18 Avenida would be), Barrio Cabañas, Barrio La Navidad, San Pedro, Barrio Las Palmas, Barrio San Luís, Colonia La Unión, Barrio La Paz. Farther out: Colonia Rivera Hernández, San Cristobal.

===Chamelecón===
With dateline giving San Pedro Sula as the location, the New York Times in 2014 described the Chamelecón district as a &quot;warren of modest cement-block houses painted in now chipped and fading pastels&quot;, subject to pressure of street gangs. This is not the Colonia El Chamelecón neighborhood within San Pedro Sula, but rather it is the Chamelecón that lies outside to the south of San Pedro Sula, on the Chamelecón River.

<doc id="207599" wikidata="Q375966" url="?curid=207599" title="Phil Hellmuth">
<text>Phillip Jerome Hellmuth Jr. (born July 16, 1964) is an American professional poker player who has won a record seventeen World Series of Poker bracelets, the majority in no-limit hold&#x27;em. He is the winner of the Main Event of the 1989 World Series of Poker (WSOP) and the Main Event of the 2012 World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE), and he is a 2007 inductee of the WSOP&#x27;s Poker Hall of Fame. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest tournament players in history.

==Personal life==
Hellmuth was born in Madison, Wisconsin, and attended Madison West High School. He had trouble with grades and friends during school and said at the time he was the &quot;ugly duckling&quot; of his family. He moved on to the University of Wisconsin–Madison for three years, where he dropped out to become a full-time poker player.

Since 1992, he has lived in Palo Alto, California, with his wife, Katherine Sanborn, who is a psychiatrist at Stanford University, and their two sons, Phillip III and Nicholas.

==Poker career==
Hellmuth is known for usually taking his seat at poker tournaments long after they begin.

As of December 2024, his live tournament winnings exceed $30,000,000.

===World Series of Poker===

In the 1988 World Series of Poker, Hellmuth had his first in-the-money finish at the $1,500 Seven Card Stud Split, a fifth-place finish. In the 1988 WSOP, he came in 33rd after being eliminated by eventual champion Johnny Chan.

In 1989, the 24-year-old Hellmuth became the youngest player to win the Main Event of the WSOP by defeating the two-time defending champion Johnny Chan in heads-up play; Hellmuth&#x27;s record was broken by Peter Eastgate (22) in 2008.

As of September 2020, Hellmuth had won over $15,000,000 at the WSOP and ranked fourth on the WSOP All Time Money List, behind Antonio Esfandiari, Daniel Colman, and Daniel Negreanu. Hellmuth also was fifth all time in number of times cashed in the WSOP Main Event with eight (1988, 1989, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2009, and 2015), placing him behind Berry Johnston (ten), and Humberto Brenes, Doyle Brunson, and Bobby Baldwin (nine).

Fourteen of Hellmuth&#x27;s 17 bracelets have been in Texas hold&#x27;em, though he has had some success in non-hold&#x27;em events. As of the start of the 2015 World Series, 22 of Hellmuth&#x27;s 52 final tables are for a variety of games, including 2–7 Lowball, Seven Card Stud Hi-Lo, Seven Card Razz, and Omaha hold&#x27;em (Pot Limit, Limit, and Hi-Lo), as well as mixed games like H.O.R.S.E and the $50,000 Poker Player&#x27;s Championship; his first-ever WSOP final table (and first-ever WSOP cash) was in Seven Card Stud Hi-Lo in 1988, and his second-ever WSOP final table (and third-ever WSOP cash) was in Pot Limit Omaha hold&#x27;em w/Rebuys in 1989. His third-ever WSOP final table (and fifth-ever WSOP cash) was his Main Event victory in 1989.) Of those 22 events, Hellmuth has finished runner-up six times.

At the 1993 World Series of Poker, Hellmuth became the second player in WSOP history to win three bracelets in one WSOP. (Walter &quot;Puggy&quot; Pearson was the first to do so in 1973; one of those bracelets was for winning the Main Event.) Hellmuth&#x27;s three victories came in three consecutive days. (Ted Forrest also won three bracelets in three consecutive days at the 1993 WSOP to become the third player to win three bracelets in one WSOP.)

At the 1997 World Series of Poker, Hellmuth won his 5th bracelet of the decade, the most of any player in the 1990s.

At the 2006 World Series of Poker, Hellmuth captured his 10th World Series of Poker bracelet in the $1,000 No Limit Hold&#x27;em with rebuys event. At the time, it tied him with Doyle Brunson and Johnny Chan for most bracelets. At the 2007 World Series of Poker, Hellmuth won his record-breaking 11th bracelet in the $1,500 No Limit Hold&#x27;em Event.

Hellmuth&#x27;s sponsor arranged for him to arrive at the 2007 WSOP Main Event in a race car. Hellmuth lost control of the car in the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino parking lot and hit a light fixture. He gave up the car for a limo, arriving at the Main Event two hours late.

At the 2008 WSOP Main Event, Hellmuth verbally abused another player and received a one-round penalty. After a private meeting with WSOP Commissioner Jeffrey Pollack, the penalty was overruled, and Hellmuth finished the tournament in 45th place.

In the 2011 World Series of Poker, Phil finished second in three tournaments, in the 2–7 Draw Lowball Championship, the Seven Card Stud Hi-Low Split-8 or Better Championship, and The Poker Player&#x27;s Championship eight-game mix.

On June 11, 2012, Hellmuth won his 12th World Series of Poker bracelet in the $2,500 Seven-Card Razz event, defeating Don Zewin and earning $182,793. Zewin had finished third to Chan and Hellmuth when Hellmuth won his first bracelet in 1989. This is the first bracelet Hellmuth has won in a non-hold&#x27;em event, and made him the first player to win at least one bracelet in each of the last four decades, and only the third player in WSOP history to win a bracelet in four decades (Jay Heimowitz won 6 bracelets, spanning the 1970s through the 2000s, and Billy Baxter won 7 bracelets, also spanning the 1970s through the 2000s). Hellmuth also collected $2,645,333 for his fourth-place finish in the $1,000,000 buy-in &quot;Big One for One Drop&quot; tournament, by far the largest single tournament cash of his career.

On October 4, 2012, Hellmuth won his 13th World Series of Poker bracelet in the €10,450 WSOPE No Limit Hold&#x27;em Main Event, earning €1,022,376 ($1,333,841) and becoming the first player to ever win both the WSOP and WSOPE Main Events. This win also made Hellmuth the first player in WSOP history to win multiple bracelets in three decades (1993 (3), 2003 (2), and 2012 (2)). Also, Hellmuth finished runner-up in the WSOP Player of the Year race for a record third time (2006, 2011, and 2012).

In 2010. he was the television bubble boy finishing seventh at the $25,000 WPT World Championship.

===Other notable tournaments===
Hellmuth makes regular appearances on episodes of &quot;Poker After Dark&quot; on PokerGO both as a player and as a drop-in commentator. Hellmuth won his first &quot;Poker After Dark&quot; tournament in the first episode of the third season, winning $120,000. Hellmuth returned two weeks later and claimed his second &quot;Poker After Dark&quot; title, winning another $120,000. Hellmuth is the Season 3 champion of &quot;Late Night Poker&quot;.

In 2000, he won the Poker EM 7-Card Stud Main Event in Austria. Phil defeated 437 other players to win $106,250. In 2005, Hellmuth won the first NBC National Heads-Up Poker Championship. He defeated Men Nguyen, Paul Phillips, Huck Seed, Lyle Berman and Antonio Esfandiari on the way to the final against Chris Ferguson whom he defeated in two out of three games. While trying to repeat in 2006, he lost in the first round to Chip Reese. In 2007, Hellmuth did not play due to the PartyPoker.com Premier League Poker, a British tournament in which he took part. He won four out of his six group matches and eventually finished third in the finals. Hellmuth took part in the 2008 National Heads-Up Poker Championship, losing in the first round to Tom Dwan. In 2013, Hellmuth finished in second place, losing to Mike Matusow in the final round and earning $300,000.

In July 2020, PokerGO announced a new series called &quot;High Stakes Duel&quot; which would follow a heads-up format of poker with the stakes doubling every round and the loser of the match having the first option to challenge for a rematch. Hellmuth would face Antonio Esfandiari in Round 1 on July 31, 2020, with the buy-in for each player being $50,000. Hellmuth defeated Esfandiari, and Esfandiari immediately declared his intention for a rematch. Round 2 was held on September 24, 2020, and would see each player buy-in for $100,000. Hellmuth again defeated Esfandiari, and Round 3 would be set for October 21, 2020, when Esfandiari immediately challenged for a rematch after the loss. Round 3 saw the buy-in doubled to $200,000, and Hellmuth defeated Esfandiari for the third consecutive time. Following the unique rules of &quot;High Stakes Duel&quot;, Esfandiari was out of challenges and Hellmuth could cash out his $400,000 in winnings or progress through to Round 4. Hellmuth decided to cash out the $400,000 and announced in his winner&#x27;s interview that he will be ready for Season 2.

In 2021, Phil Hellmuth challenged Daniel Negreanu in High Stakes Duel II. The two played three rounds, and Hellmuth won all three and cashed out his $400,000. Following that victory, he returned for High Stakes Duel III. In round 1, he faced challenger Nick Wright of Fox Sports and won $100,000. His seven-game winning streak came to an end after Tom Dwan challenged him in round 2 and defeated him for $200,000. Phil Hellmuth defeated Dwan in round 3 for $400,000.

==Other activities==
Hellmuth appeared in GSN&#x27;s and PokerGo&#x27;s cash game show, &quot;High Stakes Poker&quot;. He was involved with creating the software for UltimateBet and was formerly a member of Team UB.

Hellmuth has made several instructional poker videos, including his &quot;Ultimate White To Black Belt Course&quot; and &quot;Phil Hellmuth&#x27;s Million Dollar Poker System.&quot; He has written for Cardplayer magazine and authored several poker books including &quot;Play Poker like the Pros,&quot; &quot;Bad Beats and Lucky Draws,&quot; &quot;The Greatest Poker Hands ever Played&quot;, and &quot;Poker Brat.&quot; In May 2004 he partnered with Oasys Mobile to create a mobile app called &quot;Texas Hold&#x27;em by Phil Hellmuth.&quot; In spring 2006, Hellmuth replaced Phil Gordon as commentator on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot;. Hellmuth was a poker coach on Fox Sports Network’s Best Damn Poker Show.

In 2009, Hellmuth&#x27;s publishing company, Phil&#x27;s House Publishing, published the Stephen John and Marvin Karlins book &quot;Deal Me In: 20 Of The World&#x27;s Top Poker Players Share The Heartbreaking and Inspiring Stories of How They Turned Pro&quot;.

==Personality and controversy==

Hellmuth is known for his &quot;Poker Brat&quot; personality, especially after taking bad beats. In the first week of &quot;Poker After Dark&quot; on NBC, Hellmuth asked fellow pros Shawn Sheikhan, Steve Zolotow, Gus Hansen and Huck Seed to stop talking while it was his turn to act on his hand after Annie Duke raised him. They initially complied, but when Hellmuth began to talk, he was mocked by Seed, who said, &quot;please be quiet so I can talk,&quot; eliciting laughter from the other players. Hellmuth then threatened never to play on the show again and walked off the set. After the show&#x27;s producers intervened, Hellmuth returned and was eliminated a few hands later by Sheikhan. Duke remained quiet while the drama played out, though in a later interview, she described Hellmuth&#x27;s behavior as &quot;one of the biggest overreactions I have ever seen.&quot;

On Day 5 of the 2008 WSOP Main Event, Hellmuth folded to Cristian Dragomir&#x27;s bet on a flop of . Asked by the table to show his hand, Dragomir revealed that he had called Hellmuth&#x27;s pre-flop re-raise with , a much weaker hand. Hellmuth proceeded to call Dragomir an &quot;idiot,&quot; among other insults, and was eventually issued a warning by the floorperson for continued berating of another player. Other players, including his friend Mike Matusow, advised him to stop. Nonetheless, he continued to verbally abuse Dragomir until he received a one-round penalty. The penalty was to be carried out at the beginning of play the next day. After Hellmuth had a private meeting with WSOP Commissioner Jeffrey Pollack, Pollack overruled the floorperson&#x27;s penalty.

<doc id="207600" wikidata="Q26371" url="?curid=207600" title="Hemiptera">
<text>Hemiptera (; ) is an order of insects, commonly called true bugs, comprising over 80,000 species within groups such as the cicadas, aphids, planthoppers, leafhoppers, assassin bugs, bed bugs, and shield bugs. They range in size from to around , and share a common arrangement of piercing-sucking mouthparts. The name &quot;true bugs&quot; is often limited to the suborder Heteroptera.

Entomologists reserve the term &quot;bug&quot; for Hemiptera or Heteroptera, which does not include other arthropods or insects of other orders such as ants, bees, beetles, or butterflies. In some varieties of English, all terrestrial arthropods (including non-insect arachnids and myriapods) also fall under the colloquial understanding of &quot;bug&quot;.

Many insects with &quot;bug&quot; in their common name, especially in American English, belong to other orders; for example, the lovebug is a fly and the Maybug and ladybug are beetles. The term is occasionally extended to colloquial names for freshwater or marine crustaceans (e.g. Balmain bug, Moreton Bay bug, mudbug) and used by physicians and bacteriologists for disease-causing germs (e.g. superbugs).

Most hemipterans feed on plants, using their sucking and piercing mouthparts to extract plant sap. Some are bloodsucking, or hematophagous, while others are predators that feed on other insects or small invertebrates. They live in a wide variety of habitats, generally terrestrial, though some are adapted to life in or on the surface of fresh water (e.g. pondskaters, water boatmen, giant water bugs). Hemipterans are hemimetabolous, with young nymphs that somewhat resemble adults. Many aphids are capable of parthenogenesis, producing young from unfertilised eggs; this helps them to reproduce extremely rapidly in favourable conditions.

Humans have interacted with the Hemiptera for millennia. Some species, including many aphids, are significant agricultural pests, damaging crops by sucking the sap. Others harm humans more directly as vectors of serious viral diseases. The bed bug is a persistent parasite of humans, and some kissing bugs can transmit Chagas disease. Some species have been used for biological control of insect pests or of invasive plants. A few hemipterans, have been cultivated for the extraction of dyestuffs such as cochineal and carmine, and for shellac. Cicadas have been used as food, and have appeared in literature since the &quot;Iliad&quot; in Ancient Greece.

== Diversity ==

Hemiptera is the largest order of hemimetabolous insects (not undergoing complete metamorphosis; though some examples such as male scale insects do undergo a form of complete metamorphosis ), containing over 95,000 named species. Other insect orders with more species are all holometabolous, meaning they have a pupal stage and undergo complete metamorphosis. The majority of species are terrestrial, including a number of important agricultural pests, but some are found in freshwater habitats. These include the water boatmen, backswimmers, pond skaters, and giant water bugs.

== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==

Hemiptera belong to the insect superorder Paraneoptera, which includes lice (Psocodea), thrips (Thysanoptera), and the true bugs of Hemiptera. Within Paraneoptera, Hemiptera is most closely related to the sister clade Thysanoptera.

The fossil record of hemipterans goes back to the Carboniferous (Moscovian). The oldest fossils are of the Archescytinidae from the Lower Permian and are thought to be basal to the Auchenorrhyncha. Fulgoromorpha and Cicadomorpha appear in the Upper Permian, as do Sternorrhyncha of the Psylloidea and Aleyrodoidea. Aphids and Coccoids appear in the Triassic. The Coleorrhyncha extend back to the Lower Jurassic. The Heteroptera first appeared in the Triassic.

The present members of the order Hemiptera (sometimes referred to as Rhynchota) were historically placed into two orders, the so-called Homoptera and Heteroptera/Hemiptera, based on differences in wing structure and the position of the rostrum. &quot;Homoptera&quot; was established as paraphyletic group and an obsolete name.

The order is now divided into four suborders, Heteroptera, Sternorrhyncha, Auchenorrhyncha, and Coleorrhyncha. The earlier work was based on nuclear DNA, but later phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA suggests that Homoptera may be monophyletic after all, a sister group of Heteroptera. The cause of the disparity in the analyses is suggested to be the long branch attraction effect in phylogenetic analysis, due to rapidly evolving DNA regions.

The cladogram shows Hemiptera&#x27;s placement within Paraneoptera, as well as how Hemiptera&#x27;s four suborders are related. English names are given in parentheses where possible.

== Biology ==

=== Mouthparts ===

The defining feature of hemipterans is their &quot;beak&quot; in which the modified mandibles and maxillae form a &quot;stylet&quot; which is sheathed within a modified labium. The stylet is capable of piercing tissues and sucking liquids, while the labium supports it. The stylet contains a channel for the outward movement of saliva and another for the inward movement of liquid food. A salivary pump drives saliva into the prey; a cibarial pump extracts liquid from the prey. Both pumps are powered by substantial dilator muscles in the head. The beak is usually folded under the body when not in use. The diet is typically plant sap, but some hemipterans such as assassin bugs are predators.

Both herbivorous and predatory hemipterans inject enzymes to begin digestion extra-orally (before the food is taken into the body). These enzymes include amylase to hydrolyse starch, polygalacturonase to weaken the tough cell walls of plants, and proteinases to break down proteins.

Although the Hemiptera vary widely in their overall form, their mouthparts form a distinctive &quot;rostrum&quot;. Other insect orders with mouthparts modified into anything like the rostrum and stylets of the Hemiptera include some Phthiraptera, but for other reasons they generally are easy to recognize as non-hemipteran. Similarly, the mouthparts of Siphonaptera, some Diptera and Thysanoptera superficially resemble the rostrum of the Hemiptera, but on closer inspection the differences are considerable. Aside from the mouthparts, various other insects can be confused with Hemiptera, but they all have biting mandibles and maxillae instead of the rostrum. Examples include cockroaches and psocids, both of which have longer, many-segmented antennae, and some beetles, but these have fully hardened forewings which do not overlap.

=== Wing structure ===

The forewings of Hemiptera are either entirely membranous, as in the Sternorrhyncha and Auchenorrhyncha, or partially hardened, as in most Heteroptera. The name &quot;Hemiptera&quot; is from the Greek (&#x27;; &quot;half&quot;) and (&#x27;; &quot;wing&quot;), referring to the forewings of many heteropterans which are hardened near the base, but membranous at the ends. Wings modified in this manner are termed &quot;hemelytra&quot; (singular: &quot;hemelytron&quot;), by analogy with the completely hardened elytra of beetles, and occur only in the suborder Heteroptera. In all suborders, the hindwings – if present at all – are entirely membranous and usually shorter than the forewings. The forewings may be held &quot;roofwise&quot; over the body (typical of Sternorrhyncha and Auchenorrhyncha), or held flat on the back, with the ends overlapping (typical of Heteroptera). The antennae in Hemiptera typically consist of four or five segments, although they can still be quite long, and the tarsi of the legs have two or three segments.

=== Sound production ===

Many hemipterans can produce sound for communication. The &quot;song&quot; of male cicadas, the loudest of any insect, is produced by tymbal organs on the underside of the abdomen, and is used to attract mates. The tymbals are drumlike disks of cuticle, which are clicked in and out repeatedly, making a sound in the same way as popping the metal lid of a jam jar in and out.

Stridulatory sounds are produced among the aquatic Corixidae and Notonectidae (backswimmers) using tibial combs rubbed across rostral ridges.

=== Life cycle ===

Hemipterans are hemimetabolous, meaning that they do not undergo metamorphosis, the complete change of form between a larval phase and an adult phase. Instead, their young are called nymphs, and resemble the adults to a greater or lesser degree. The nymphs moult several times as they grow, and each instar resembles the adult more than the previous one. Wing buds grow in later stage nymphs; the final transformation involves little more than the development of functional wings (if they are present at all) and functioning sexual organs, with no intervening pupal stage as in holometabolous insects.

==== Parthenogenesis and viviparity ====


Many aphids are parthenogenetic during part of the life cycle, such that females can produce unfertilized eggs, which are clones of their mother. All such young are females (thelytoky), so 100% of the population at these times can produce more offspring. Many species of aphid are also viviparous: the young are born live rather than laid as eggs. These adaptations enable aphids to reproduce extremely rapidly when conditions are suitable.

== Locomotion ==


Hemipterans make use of a variety of modes of locomotion including swimming, skating on a water surface and jumping, as well as walking and flying like other insects.

=== Swimming and skating ===

Several families of Heteroptera are &quot;water bugs&quot;, adapted to an aquatic lifestyle, such as the water boatmen (Corixidae), water scorpions (Nepidae), and backswimmers (Notonectidae). They are mostly predatory, and have legs adapted as paddles to help the animal move through the water. The pondskaters or water striders (Gerridae) are also associated with water, but use the surface tension of standing water to keep them above the surface; they include the sea skaters in the genus &quot;Halobates&quot;, the only truly marine group of insects.

=== Marangoni propulsion ===

Marangoni effect propulsion exploits the change in surface tension when a soap-like surfactant is released on to a water surface, in the same way that a toy soap boat propels itself. Water bugs in the genus &quot;Microvelia&quot; (Veliidae) can travel at up to 17 cm/s, twice as fast as they can walk, by this means.

=== Flight ===

Flight is well developed in the Hemiptera although mostly used for short distance movement and dispersal. Wing development is sometimes related to environmental conditions. In some groups of Hemiptera, there are variations of winged, short-winged, and wingless forms within a single species. This kind of polymorphism tends to be helpful when habitats are temporary with more energy put into reproduction when food is available and into dispersal through flight when food becomes scarce. In aphids, both winged and wingless forms occur with winged forms produced in greater numbers when food resources are depleted. Aphids and whiteflies can sometimes be transported very long distances by atmospheric updrafts and high altitude winds. Wing-length polymorphism is notably rare in tree-living Hemiptera.

=== Jumping ===

Many Auchenorrhyncha including representatives of the cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, and froghoppers are adapted for jumping (saltation). Treehoppers, for example, jump by rapidly depressing their hind legs. Before jumping, the hind legs are raised and the femora are pressed tightly into curved indentations in the coxae. Treehoppers can attain a take-off velocity of up to 2.7 metres per second and an acceleration of up to 250 g. The instantaneous power output is much greater than that of normal muscle, implying that energy is stored and released to catapult the insect into the air. Cicadas, which are much larger, extend their hind legs for a jump in under a millisecond, again implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release.

===Sedentary===

Instead of relying on any form of locomotion, most Sternorrhyncha females are sedentary or completely sessile, attached to their host plants by their thin feeding stylets which cannot be taken out of the plant quickly.

==Ecological roles==

===Feeding modes===

====Herbivores====
Most hemipterans are phytophagous, using their sucking and piercing mouthparts to feed on plant sap. These include cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, froghoppers, aphids, whiteflies, scale insects, and some other groups. Some are monophages, being host specific and only found on one plant taxon, others are oligophages, feeding on a few plant groups, while others again are less discriminating polyphages and feed on many species of plant. The relationship between hemipterans and plants appears to be ancient, with piercing and sucking of plants evident in the Early Devonian period.

Hemipterans can dramatically cut the mass of affected plants, especially in major outbreaks. They sometimes also change the mix of plants by predation on seeds or feeding on roots of certain species. Some sap-suckers move from one host to another at different times of year. Many aphids spend the winter as eggs on a woody host plant and the summer as parthenogenetically reproducing females on a herbaceous plant.

Phloem sap, which has a higher concentration of sugars and nitrogen, is under positive pressure unlike the more dilute xylem sap. Most of the Sternorrhyncha and a number of Auchenorrhynchan groups feed on phloem. Phloem feeding is common in the Fulgoromorpha, most Cicadellidae and in the Heteroptera.

The Typhlocybine Cicadellids specialize in feeding on non-vascular mesophyll tissue of leaves, which is more nutritious than the leaf epidermis. Most Heteroptera also feed on mesophyll tissue where they are more likely to encounter defensive secondary plant metabolites which often leads to the evolution of host specificity.

Obligate xylem feeding is a special habit that is found in the Auchenorrhyncha among Cicadoidea, Cercopoidea and in Cicadelline Cicadellids. Some phloem feeders may take to xylem sap facultatively, especially when facing dehydration. Xylem feeders tend to be polyphagous; to overcome the negative pressure of xylem requires a special cibarial pump.

Phloem feeding hemiptera typically have symbiotic micro-organisms in their gut that help to convert amino acids. Phloem feeders produce honeydew from their anus. A variety of organisms that feed on honeydew form symbiotic associations with phloem-feeders. Phloem sap is a sugary liquid low in amino acids, so insects have to process large quantities to meet their nutritional requirements. Xylem sap is even lower in amino acids and contains monosaccharides rather than sucrose, as well as organic acids and minerals. No digestion is required (except for the hydrolysis of sucrose) and 90% of the nutrients in the xylem sap can be utilised. Some phloem sap feeders selectively mix phloem and xylem sap to control the osmotic potential of the liquid consumed.

A striking adaptation to a very dilute diet is found in many hemipterans: a filter chamber, a part of the gut looped back on itself as a countercurrent exchanger, which permits nutrients to be separated from excess water. The residue, mostly water with sugars and amino acids, is quickly excreted as sticky &quot;honey dew&quot;, notably from aphids but also from other Auchenorrhycha and Sternorrhyncha.

Some Sternorrhyncha including Psyllids and some aphids are gall formers. These sap-sucking hemipterans inject fluids containing plant hormones into the plant tissues inducing the production of tissue that covers to protects the insect and also act as sinks for nutrition that they feed on. The hackleberry gall psyllid for example, causes a woody gall on the leaf petioles of the hackleberry tree it infests, and the nymph of another psyllid produces a protective lerp out of hardened honeydew.

====Predators====

Most other hemipterans are predatory, feeding on other insects, or even small vertebrates. This is true of many aquatic species which are predatory, either as nymphs or adults. The predatory shield bug for example stabs caterpillars with its beak and sucks out the body fluids. The saliva of predatory heteropterans contains digestive enzymes such as proteinase and phospholipase, and in some species also amylase. The mouthparts of these insects are adapted for predation. There are toothed stylets on the mandibles able to cut into and abrade tissues of their prey. There are further stylets on the maxillae, adapted as tubular canals to inject saliva and to extract the pre-digested and liquified contents of the prey.

====Haematophagic ectoparasites====

A few hemipterans are haematophagic ectoparasites), feeding on the blood of larger animals. These include bedbugs and the triatomine kissing bugs of the assassin bug family Reduviidae, which can transmit the dangerous &quot;Chagas disease&quot;. The first known hemipteran to feed in this way on vertebrates was the extinct assassin bug &quot;Triatoma dominicana&quot; found fossilized in amber and dating back about twenty million years. Faecal pellets fossilised beside it show that it transmitted a disease-causing &quot;Trypanosoma&quot; and the amber included hairs of the likely host, a bat.

=== As symbionts ===

Some species of ant protect and farm aphids (Sternorrhyncha) and other sap-sucking hemipterans, gathering and eating the honeydew that these hemipterans secrete. The relationship is mutualistic, as both ant and aphid benefit. Ants such as the yellow anthill ant, &quot;Lasius flavus&quot;, breed aphids of at least four species, &quot;Geoica utricularia&quot;, &quot;Tetraneura ulmi&quot;, &quot;Forda marginata&quot; and &quot;Forda formicaria&quot;, taking eggs with them when they found a new colony; in return, these aphids are obligately associated with the ant, breeding mainly or wholly asexually inside anthills. Ants may also protect the plant bugs from their natural enemies, removing the eggs of predatory beetles and preventing access by parasitic wasps.

Some leafhoppers (Auchenorrhyncha) are similarly &quot;milked&quot; by ants. In the Corcovado rain forest of Costa Rica, wasps compete with ants to protect and milk leafhoppers; the leafhoppers preferentially give more honeydew, more often, to the wasps, which are larger and may offer better protection.

===As prey: defences against predators and parasites===

Hemiptera form prey to predators including vertebrates, such as birds, and other invertebrates such as ladybirds. In response, hemipterans have evolved antipredator adaptations. &quot;Ranatra&quot; may feign death (thanatosis). Others such as &quot;Carpocoris purpureipennis&quot; secrete toxic fluids to ward off arthropod predators; some Pentatomidae such as &quot;Dolycoris&quot; are able to direct these fluids at an attacker. Toxic cardenolide compounds are accumulated by the heteropteran &quot;Oncopeltus fasciatus&quot; when it consumes milkweeds, while the coreid stinkbug &quot;Amorbus rubiginosus&quot; acquires 2-hexenal from its food plant, &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;. Some long-legged bugs mimic twigs, rocking to and fro to simulate the motion of a plant part in the wind. The nymph of the Masked hunter bug camouflages itself with sand grains, using its hind legs and tarsal fan to form a double layer of grains, coarser on the outside. The Amazon rain forest cicada &quot;Hemisciera maculipennis&quot; displays bright red deimatic flash coloration on its hindwings when threatened; the sudden contrast helps to startle predators, giving the cicada time to escape. The coloured patch on the hindwing is concealed at rest by an olive green patch of the same size on the forewing, enabling the insect to switch rapidly from cryptic to deimatic behaviour.

Some hemipterans such as firebugs have bold aposematic warning coloration, often red and black, which appear to deter passerine birds. Many hemipterans including aphids, scale insects and especially the planthoppers secrete wax to protect themselves from threats such as fungi, parasitoidal insects and predators, as well as abiotic factors like desiccation. Hard waxy coverings are especially important in the sedentary Sternorrhyncha such as scale insects, which have no means of escaping from predators; other Sternorrhyncha evade detection and attack by creating and living inside plant galls. Nymphal Cicadoidea and Cercopoidea have glands attached to the Malpighian tubules in their proximal segment that produce mucopolysaccharides, which form the froth around spittlebugs, offering a measure of protection.

Parental care is found in many species of Hemiptera especially in members of the Membracidae and numerous Heteroptera. In many species of shield bug, females stand guard over their egg clusters to protect them from egg parasitoids and predators. In the aquatic Belostomatidae, females lay their eggs on the back of the male which guards the eggs. Protection provided by ants is common in the Auchenorrhyncha.

== Interaction with humans ==

=== As pests ===

Although many species of Hemiptera are significant pests of crops and garden plants, including many species of aphid and scale insects, other species are harmless. The damage done is often not so much the deprivation of the plant of its sap, but the fact that they transmit serious viral diseases between plants. They often produce copious amounts of honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mould. Significant pests include the cottony cushion scale, a pest of citrus fruit trees, the green peach aphid and other aphids which attack crops worldwide and transmit diseases, and jumping plant lice which can be plant-specific and transmit diseases, as with the Asian citrus psyllid which transmits citrus greening disease.

=== For pest control ===
Members of the families Reduviidae, Phymatidae and Nabidae are obligate predators. Some predatory species are used in biological pest control; these include various nabids, and even some members of families that are primarily phytophagous, such as the genus &quot;Geocoris&quot; in the family Lygaeidae. Other hemipterans are omnivores, alternating between a plant-based and an animal-based diet. For example, &quot;Dicyphus hesperus&quot; is used to control whitefly on tomatoes but also sucks sap, and if deprived of plant tissues will die even if in the presence of whiteflies.

The spined soldier bug (&quot;Podisus maculiventris&quot;) sucks body fluids from several pests including the larvae of the Colorado beetle and the Mexican bean beetle.

=== Insect products ===

Other hemipterans have positive uses for humans, such as in the production of the dyestuff carmine (cochineal). The FDA has created guidelines for how to declare when it has been added to a product. The scale insect &quot;Dactylopius coccus&quot; produces the brilliant red-coloured carminic acid to deter predators. Up to 100,000 scale insects need to be collected and processed to make a kilogram (2.2 lbs) of cochineal dye. A similar number of lac bugs are needed to make a kilogram of shellac, a brush-on colourant and wood finish. Additional uses of this traditional product include the waxing of citrus fruits to extend their shelf-life, and the coating of pills to moisture-proof them, provide slow-release or mask the taste of bitter ingredients.
=== As human parasites and disease vectors ===

Chagas disease is a modern-day tropical disease caused by &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot; and transmitted by kissing bugs, so-called because they suck human blood from around the lips while a person sleeps.

The bed bug, &quot;Cimex lectularius&quot;, is an external parasite of humans. It lives in bedding and is mainly active at night, feeding on human blood, generally without being noticed. Bed bugs mate by traumatic insemination; the male pierces the female&#x27;s abdomen and injects his sperm into a secondary genital structure, the spermalege. The sperm travel in the female&#x27;s blood (haemolymph) to sperm storage structures (seminal conceptacles); they are released from there to fertilise her eggs inside her ovaries.

=== As food ===

Some larger hemipterans such as cicadas are used as food in Asian countries such as China, and they are much esteemed in Malawi and other African countries. Insects have a high protein content and good food conversion ratios, but most hemipterans are too small to be a useful component of the human diet. At least nine species of Hemiptera are eaten worldwide.

=== In art and literature ===

Cicadas have featured in literature since the time of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, and as motifs in decorative art from the Chinese Shang dynasty (1766–1122 B.C.). They are described by Aristotle in his &quot;History of Animals&quot; and by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Natural History&quot;; their mechanism of sound production is mentioned by Hesiod in his poem &quot;Works and Days&quot; &quot;when the Skolymus flowers, and the tuneful &quot;Tettix&quot; sitting on his tree in the weary summer season pours forth from under his wings his shrill song&quot;.

=== In mythology and folklore ===

Among the bugs, cicadas in particular have been used as money, in folk medicine, to forecast the weather, to provide song (in China), and in folklore and myths around the world.

=== Threats ===

Large-scale cultivation of the oil palm &quot;Elaeis guineensis&quot; in the Amazon basin damages freshwater habitats and reduces the diversity of aquatic and semi-aquatic Heteroptera. Climate change may be affecting the global migration of hemipterans including the potato leafhopper, &quot;Empoasca fabae&quot;. Warming is correlated with the severity of potato leafhopper infestation, so increased warming may worsen infestations in future.

<text>Adsorption is the adhesion of atoms, ions or molecules from a gas, liquid or dissolved solid to a surface. This process creates a film of the &quot;adsorbate&quot; on the surface of the &quot;adsorbent&quot;. This process differs from absorption, in which a fluid (the &quot;absorbate&quot;) is dissolved by or permeates a liquid or solid (the &quot;absorbent&quot;). While adsorption does often precede absorption, which involves the transfer of the absorbate into the volume of the absorbent material, alternatively, adsorption is distinctly a surface phenomenon, wherein the adsorbate does not penetrate through the material surface and into the bulk of the adsorbent. The term &quot;sorption&quot; encompasses both adsorption and absorption, and &quot;desorption&quot; is the reverse of sorption.

Like surface tension, adsorption is a consequence of surface energy. In a bulk material, all the bonding requirements (be they ionic, covalent or metallic) of the constituent atoms of the material are fulfilled by other atoms in the material. However, atoms on the surface of the adsorbent are not wholly surrounded by other adsorbent atoms and therefore can attract adsorbates. The exact nature of the bonding depends on the details of the species involved, but the adsorption process is generally classified as physisorption (characteristic of weak van der Waals forces) or chemisorption (characteristic of covalent bonding). It may also occur due to electrostatic attraction. The nature of the adsorption can affect the structure of the adsorbed species. For example, polymer physisorption from solution can result in squashed structures on a surface.

Adsorption is present in many natural, physical, biological and chemical systems and is widely used in industrial applications such as heterogeneous catalysts, activated charcoal, capturing and using waste heat to provide cold water for air conditioning and other process requirements (adsorption chillers), synthetic resins, increasing storage capacity of carbide-derived carbons and water purification. Adsorption, ion exchange and chromatography are sorption processes in which certain adsorbates are selectively transferred from the fluid phase to the surface of insoluble, rigid particles suspended in a vessel or packed in a column. Pharmaceutical industry applications, which use adsorption as a means to prolong neurological exposure to specific drugs or parts thereof, are lesser known.

The word &quot;adsorption&quot; was coined in 1881 by German physicist Heinrich Kayser (1853–1940).

==Isotherms==
The adsorption of gases and solutes is usually described through isotherms, that is, the amount of adsorbate on the adsorbent as a function of its pressure (if gas) or concentration (for liquid phase solutes) at constant temperature. The quantity adsorbed is nearly always normalized by the mass of the adsorbent to allow comparison of different materials. To date, 15 different isotherm models have been developed.

=== Freundlich ===

The first mathematical fit to an isotherm was published by Freundlich and Kuster (1906) and is a purely empirical formula for gaseous adsorbates:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the mass of adsorbate adsorbed, formula_3 is the mass of the adsorbent, formula_4 is the pressure of adsorbate (this can be changed to concentration if investigating solution rather than gas), and formula_5 and formula_6 are empirical constants for each adsorbent–adsorbate pair at a given temperature. The function is not adequate at very high pressure because in reality formula_7 has an asymptotic maximum as pressure increases without bound. As the temperature increases, the constants formula_5 and formula_6 change to reflect the empirical observation that the quantity adsorbed rises more slowly and higher pressures are required to saturate the surface.

===Langmuir===

Irving Langmuir was the first to derive a scientifically based adsorption isotherm in 1918. The model applies to gases adsorbed on solid surfaces. It is a semi-empirical isotherm with a kinetic basis and was derived based on statistical thermodynamics. It is the most common isotherm equation to use due to its simplicity and its ability to fit a variety of adsorption data. It is based on four assumptions:
# All of the adsorption sites are equivalent, and each site can only accommodate one molecule.
# The surface is energetically homogeneous, and adsorbed molecules do not interact.
# There are no phase transitions.
# At the maximum adsorption, only a monolayer is formed. Adsorption only occurs on localized sites on the surface, not with other adsorbates.

These four assumptions are seldom all true: there are always imperfections on the surface, adsorbed molecules are not necessarily inert, and the mechanism is clearly not the same for the first molecules to adsorb to a surface as for the last. The fourth condition is the most troublesome, as frequently more molecules will adsorb to the monolayer; this problem is addressed by the BET isotherm for relatively flat (non-microporous) surfaces. The Langmuir isotherm is nonetheless the first choice for most models of adsorption and has many applications in surface kinetics (usually called Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics) and thermodynamics.

Langmuir suggested that adsorption takes place through this mechanism: formula_10, where &quot;A&quot; is a gas molecule, and &quot;S&quot; is an adsorption site. The direct and inverse rate constants are &quot;k&quot; and &quot;k&quot;−1. If we define surface coverage, formula_11, as the fraction of the adsorption sites occupied, in the equilibrium we have:

:formula_12

or

:formula_13

where formula_4 is the partial pressure of the gas or the molar concentration of the solution.
For very low pressures formula_15, and for high pressures formula_16.

The value of formula_11 is difficult to measure experimentally; usually, the adsorbate is a gas and the quantity adsorbed is given in moles, grams, or gas volumes at standard temperature and pressure (STP) per gram of adsorbent. If we call &quot;v&quot;mon the STP volume of adsorbate required to form a monolayer on the adsorbent (per gram of adsorbent), then formula_18, and we obtain an expression for a straight line:

:formula_19

Through its slope and &quot;y&quot; intercept we can obtain &quot;v&quot;mon and &quot;K&quot;, which are constants for each adsorbent–adsorbate pair at a given temperature. &quot;v&quot;mon is related to the number of adsorption sites through the ideal gas law. If we assume that the number of sites is just the whole area of the solid divided into the cross section of the adsorbate molecules, we can easily calculate the surface area of the adsorbent.
The surface area of an adsorbent depends on its structure: the more pores it has, the greater the area, which has a big influence on reactions on surfaces.

If more than one gas adsorbs on the surface, we define formula_20 as the fraction of empty sites, and we have:

:formula_21

Also, we can define formula_22 as the fraction of the sites occupied by the &quot;j&quot;-th gas:

:formula_23

where &quot;i&quot; is each one of the gases that adsorb.

Note:

1) To choose between the Langmuir and Freundlich equations, the enthalpies of adsorption must be investigated. While the Langmuir model assumes that the energy of adsorption remains constant with surface occupancy, the Freundlich equation is derived with the assumption that the heat of adsorption continually decrease as the binding sites are occupied. The choice of the model based on best fitting of the data is a common misconception.

2) The use of the linearized form of the Langmuir model is no longer common practice. Advances in computational power allowed for nonlinear regression to be performed quickly and with higher confidence since no data transformation is required.

===BET===

Often molecules do form multilayers, that is, some are adsorbed on already adsorbed molecules, and the Langmuir isotherm is not valid. In 1938 Stephen Brunauer, Paul Emmett, and Edward Teller developed a model isotherm that takes that possibility into account. Their theory is called BET theory, after the initials in their last names. They modified Langmuir&#x27;s mechanism as follows:

:A(g) + S ⇌ AS,

:A(g) + AS ⇌ A2S,

:A(g) + A2S ⇌ A3S and so on.

The derivation of the formula is more complicated than Langmuir&#x27;s (see links for complete derivation). We obtain:

:formula_24

where &quot;x&quot; is the pressure divided by the vapor pressure for the adsorbate at that temperature (usually denoted formula_25), &quot;v&quot; is the STP volume of adsorbed adsorbate, &quot;vmon&quot; is the STP volume of the amount of adsorbate required to form a monolayer, and &quot;c&quot; is the equilibrium constant &quot;K&quot; we used in Langmuir isotherm multiplied by the vapor pressure of the adsorbate. The key assumption used in deriving the BET equation that the successive heats of adsorption for all layers except the first are equal to the heat of condensation of the adsorbate.

The Langmuir isotherm is usually better for chemisorption, and the BET isotherm works better for physisorption for non-microporous surfaces.

===Kisliuk===
In other instances, molecular interactions between gas molecules previously adsorbed on a solid surface form significant interactions with gas molecules in the gaseous phases. Hence, adsorption of gas molecules to the surface is more likely to occur around gas molecules that are already present on the solid surface, rendering the Langmuir adsorption isotherm ineffective for the purposes of modelling. This effect was studied in a system where nitrogen was the adsorbate and tungsten was the adsorbent by Paul Kisliuk (1922–2008) in 1957. To compensate for the increased probability of adsorption occurring around molecules present on the substrate surface, Kisliuk developed the precursor state theory, whereby molecules would enter a precursor state at the interface between the solid adsorbent and adsorbate in the gaseous phase. From here, adsorbate molecules would either adsorb to the adsorbent or desorb into the gaseous phase. The probability of adsorption occurring from the precursor state is dependent on the adsorbate&#x27;s proximity to other adsorbate molecules that have already been adsorbed. If the adsorbate molecule in the precursor state is in close proximity to an adsorbate molecule that has already formed on the surface, it has a sticking probability reflected by the size of the SE constant and will either be adsorbed from the precursor state at a rate of &quot;k&quot;EC or will desorb into the gaseous phase at a rate of &quot;k&quot;ES. If an adsorbate molecule enters the precursor state at a location that is remote from any other previously adsorbed adsorbate molecules, the sticking probability is reflected by the size of the SD constant.

These factors were included as part of a single constant termed a &quot;sticking coefficient&quot;, &quot;k&quot;E, described below:

:formula_26

As SD is dictated by factors that are taken into account by the Langmuir model, SD can be assumed to be the adsorption rate constant. However, the rate constant for the Kisliuk model (&quot;R&quot;’) is different from that of the Langmuir model, as &quot;R&quot;’ is used to represent the impact of diffusion on monolayer formation and is proportional to the square root of the system&#x27;s diffusion coefficient. The Kisliuk adsorption isotherm is written as follows, where θ(&quot;t&quot;) is fractional coverage of the adsorbent with adsorbate, and &quot;t&quot; is immersion time:

:formula_27

Solving for θ(&quot;t&quot;) yields:

:formula_28

===Adsorption enthalpy===
Adsorption constants are equilibrium constants, therefore they obey the Van &#x27;t Hoff equation:

:formula_29

As can be seen in the formula, the variation of &quot;K&quot; must be isosteric, that is, at constant coverage.
If we start from the BET isotherm and assume that the entropy change is the same for liquefaction and adsorption, we obtain
:formula_30
that is to say, adsorption is more exothermic than liquefaction.

===Single-molecule explanation===
The adsorption of ensemble molecules on a surface or interface can be divided into two processes: adsorption and desorption. If the adsorption rate wins the desorption rate, the molecules will accumulate over time giving the adsorption curve over time. If the desorption rate is larger, the number of molecules on the surface will decrease over time. The adsorption rate is dependent on the temperature, the diffusion rate of the solute (related to mean free path for pure gas), and the energy barrier between the molecule and the surface. The diffusion and key elements of the adsorption rate can be calculated using Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion and Einstein relation (kinetic theory).
Under ideal conditions, when there is no energy barrier and all molecules that diffuse and collide with the surface get adsorbed, the number of molecules adsorbed formula_31 at a surface of area formula_32 on an infinite area surface can be directly integrated from Fick&#x27;s second law differential equation to be:

:formula_33

where formula_32 is the surface area (unit m2), formula_35 is the number concentration of the molecule in the bulk solution (unit #/m3), formula_36 is the diffusion constant (unit m2/s), and formula_37 is time (unit s). Further simulations and analysis of this equation show that the square root dependence on the time is originated from the decrease of the concentrations near the surface under ideal adsorption conditions. Also, this equation only works for the beginning of the adsorption when a well-behaved concentration gradient forms near the surface. Correction on the reduction of the adsorption area and slowing down of the concentration gradient evolution have to be considered over a longer time.
Under real experimental conditions, the flow and the small adsorption area always make the adsorption rate faster than what this equation predicted, and the energy barrier will either accelerate this rate by surface attraction or slow it down by surface repulsion. Thus, the prediction from this equation is often a few to several orders of magnitude away from the experimental results. Under special cases, such as a very small adsorption area on a large surface, and under chemical equilibrium when there is no concentration gradience near the surface, this equation becomes useful to predict the adsorption rate with debatable special care to determine a specific value of formula_37 in a particular measurement.

The desorption of a molecule from the surface depends on the binding energy of the molecule to the surface and the temperature. The typical overall adsorption rate is thus often a combined result of the adsorption and desorption.

== Quantum mechanical – thermodynamic modelling for surface area and porosity ==
Since 1980 two theories were worked on to explain adsorption and obtain equations that work. These two are referred to as the chi hypothesis, the quantum mechanical derivation, and excess surface work (ESW). Both these theories yield the same equation for flat surfaces:

: formula_39

where &quot;U&quot; is the unit step function. The definitions of the other symbols is as follows:

: formula_40

where &quot;ads&quot; stands for &quot;adsorbed&quot;, &quot;m&quot; stands for &quot;monolayer equivalence&quot; and &quot;vap&quot; is reference to the vapor pressure of the liquid adsorptive at the same temperature as the solid sample. The unit function creates the definition of the molar energy of adsorption for the first adsorbed molecule by:

: formula_41

The plot of formula_42 adsorbed versus formula_43 is referred to as the chi plot. For flat surfaces, the slope of the chi plot yields the surface area. Empirically, this plot was noticed as being a very good fit to the isotherm by Michael Polanyi and also by Jan Hendrik de Boer and Cornelis Zwikker but not pursued. This was due to criticism in the former case by Albert Einstein and in the latter case by Brunauer. This flat surface equation may be used as a &quot;standard curve&quot; in the normal tradition of comparison curves, with the exception that the porous sample&#x27;s early portion of the plot of formula_42 versus formula_43 acts as a self-standard. Ultramicroporous, microporous and mesoporous conditions may be analyzed using this technique. Typical standard deviations for full isotherm fits including porous samples are less than 2%.

Notice that in this description of physical adsorption, the entropy of adsorption is consistent with the Dubinin thermodynamic criterion, that is the entropy of adsorption from the liquid state to the adsorbed state is approximately zero.

==Adsorbents==

===Characteristics and general requirements===
Adsorbents are used usually in the form of spherical pellets, rods, moldings, or monoliths with a hydrodynamic radius between 0.25 and 5 mm. They must have high abrasion resistance, high thermal stability and small pore diameters, which results in higher exposed surface area and hence high capacity for adsorption. The adsorbents must also have a distinct pore structure that enables fast transport of the gaseous vapors.
Most industrial adsorbents fall into one of three classes:
* Oxygen-containing compounds – Are typically hydrophilic and polar, including materials such as silica gel, limestone (calcium carbonate) and zeolites.
* Carbon-based compounds – Are typically hydrophobic and non-polar, including materials such as activated carbon and graphite.
* Polymer-based compounds – Are polar or non-polar, depending on the functional groups in the polymer matrix.

===Silica gel===
Silica gel is a chemically inert, non-toxic, polar and dimensionally stable (&lt; ) amorphous form of SiO2. It is prepared by the reaction between sodium silicate and acetic acid, which is followed by a series of after-treatment processes such as aging, pickling, etc. These after-treatment methods results in various pore size distributions.

Silica is used for drying of process air (e.g. oxygen, natural gas) and adsorption of heavy (polar) hydrocarbons from natural gas.

===Zeolites===

Zeolites are natural or synthetic crystalline aluminosilicates, which have a repeating pore network and release water at high temperature. Zeolites are polar in nature.

They are manufactured by hydrothermal synthesis of sodium aluminosilicate or another silica source in an autoclave followed by ion exchange with certain cations (Na+, Li+, Ca2+, K+, NH4+). The channel diameter of zeolite cages usually ranges from 2 to 9 Å. The ion exchange process is followed by drying of the crystals, which can be pelletized with a binder to form macroporous pellets.

Zeolites are applied in drying of process air, CO2 removal from natural gas, CO removal from reforming gas, air separation, catalytic cracking, and catalytic synthesis and reforming.

Non-polar (siliceous) zeolites are synthesized from aluminum-free silica sources or by dealumination of aluminum-containing zeolites. The dealumination process is done by treating the zeolite with steam at elevated temperatures, typically greater than . This high temperature heat treatment breaks the aluminum-oxygen bonds and the aluminum atom is expelled from the zeolite framework.

===Activated carbon===

The term &quot;adsorption&quot; itself was coined by Heinrich Kayser in 1881 in the context of uptake of gases by carbons.

Activated carbon is a highly porous, amorphous solid consisting of microcrystallites with a graphite lattice, usually prepared in small pellets or a powder. It is non-polar and cheap. One of its main drawbacks is that it reacts with oxygen at moderate temperatures (over 300 °C).

Activated carbon can be manufactured from carbonaceous material, including coal (bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite), peat, wood, or nutshells (e.g., coconut). The manufacturing process consists of two phases, carbonization and activation. The carbonization process includes drying and then heating to separate by-products, including tars and other hydrocarbons from the raw material, as well as to drive off any gases generated. The process is completed by heating the material over in an oxygen-free atmosphere that cannot support combustion. The carbonized particles are then &quot;activated&quot; by exposing them to an oxidizing agent, usually steam or carbon dioxide at high temperature. This agent burns off the pore blocking structures created during the carbonization phase and so, they develop a porous, three-dimensional graphite lattice structure. The size of the pores developed during activation is a function of the time that they spend in this stage. Longer exposure times result in larger pore sizes. The most popular aqueous phase carbons are bituminous based because of their hardness, abrasion resistance, pore size distribution, and low cost, but their effectiveness needs to be tested in each application to determine the optimal product.

Activated carbon is used for adsorption of organic substances and non-polar adsorbates and it is also usually used for waste gas (and waste water) treatment. It is the most widely used adsorbent since most of its chemical (e.g. surface groups) and physical properties (e.g. pore size distribution and surface area) can be tuned according to what is needed. Its usefulness also derives from its large micropore (and sometimes mesopore) volume and the resulting high surface area. Recent research works reported activated carbon as an effective agent to adsorb cationic species of toxic metals from multi-pollutant systems and also proposed possible adsorption mechanisms with supporting evidences.

==Water adsorption==
The adsorption of water at surfaces is of broad importance in chemical engineering, materials science and catalysis. Also termed surface hydration, the presence of physically or chemically adsorbed water at the surfaces of solids plays an important role in governing interface properties, chemical reaction pathways and catalytic performance in a wide range of systems. In the case of physically adsorbed water, surface hydration can be eliminated simply through drying at conditions of temperature and pressure allowing full vaporization of water. For chemically adsorbed water, hydration may be in the form of either dissociative adsorption, where H2O molecules are dissociated into surface adsorbed -H and -OH, or molecular adsorption (associative adsorption) where individual water molecules remain intact 

==Adsorption solar heating and storage==

The low cost ($200/ton) and high cycle rate (2,000 ×) of synthetic zeolites such as Linde 13X with water adsorbate has garnered much academic and commercial interest recently for use for thermal energy storage (TES), specifically of low-grade solar and waste heat. Several pilot projects have been funded in the EU from 2000 to the present (2020). The basic concept is to store solar thermal energy as chemical latent energy in the zeolite. Typically, hot dry air from flat plate solar collectors is made to flow through a bed of zeolite such that any water adsorbate present is driven off. Storage can be diurnal, weekly, monthly, or even seasonal depending on the volume of the zeolite and the area of the solar thermal panels. When heat is called for during the night, or sunless hours, or winter, humidified air flows through the zeolite. As the humidity is adsorbed by the zeolite, heat is released to the air and subsequently to the building space. This form of TES, with specific use of zeolites, was first taught by John Guerra in 1978.

==Carbon capture and storage==
Typical adsorbents proposed for carbon capture and storage are zeolites and MOFs. The customization of adsorbents makes them a potentially attractive alternative to absorption. Because adsorbents can be regenerated by temperature or pressure swing, this step can be less energy intensive than absorption regeneration methods. Major problems that are present with adsorption cost in carbon capture are: regenerating the adsorbent, mass ratio, solvent/MOF, cost of adsorbent, production of the adsorbent, lifetime of adsorbent.

In sorption enhanced water gas shift (SEWGS) technology a pre-combustion carbon capture process, based on solid adsorption, is combined with the water gas shift reaction (WGS) in order to produce a high pressure hydrogen stream. The CO2 stream produced can be stored or used for other industrial processes.

==Protein and surfactant adsorption==

Protein adsorption is a process that has a fundamental role in the field of biomaterials. Indeed, biomaterial surfaces in contact with biological media, such as blood or serum, are immediately coated by proteins. Therefore, living cells do not interact directly with the biomaterial surface, but with the adsorbed proteins layer. This protein layer mediates the interaction between biomaterials and cells, translating biomaterial physical and chemical properties into a &quot;biological language&quot;. In fact, cell membrane receptors bind to protein layer bioactive sites and these receptor-protein binding events are transduced, through the cell membrane, in a manner that stimulates specific intracellular processes that then determine cell adhesion, shape, growth and differentiation. Protein adsorption is influenced by many surface properties such as surface wettability, surface chemical composition and surface nanometre-scale morphology.
Surfactant adsorption is a similar phenomenon, but utilising surfactant molecules in the place of proteins.

==Adsorption chillers==

Combining an adsorbent with a refrigerant, adsorption chillers use heat to provide a cooling effect. This heat, in the form of hot water, may come from any number of industrial sources including waste heat from industrial processes, prime heat from solar thermal installations or from the exhaust or water jacket heat of a piston engine or turbine.

Although there are similarities between adsorption chillers and absorption refrigeration, the former is based on the interaction between gases and solids. The adsorption chamber of the chiller is filled with a solid material (for example zeolite, silica gel, alumina, active carbon or certain types of metal salts), which in its neutral state has adsorbed the refrigerant. When heated, the solid desorbs (releases) refrigerant vapour, which subsequently is cooled and liquefied. This liquid refrigerant then provides a cooling effect at the evaporator from its enthalpy of vaporization. In the final stage the refrigerant vapour is (re)adsorbed into the solid. As an adsorption chiller requires no compressor, it is relatively quiet.

==Portal site mediated adsorption==
Portal site mediated adsorption is a model for site-selective activated gas adsorption in metallic catalytic systems that contain a variety of different adsorption sites. In such systems, low-coordination &quot;edge and corner&quot; defect-like sites can exhibit significantly lower adsorption enthalpies than high-coordination (basal plane) sites. As a result, these sites can serve as &quot;portals&quot; for very rapid adsorption to the rest of the surface. The phenomenon relies on the common &quot;spillover&quot; effect (described below), where certain adsorbed species exhibit high mobility on some surfaces. The model explains seemingly inconsistent observations of gas adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics in catalytic systems where surfaces can exist in a range of coordination structures, and it has been successfully applied to bimetallic catalytic systems where synergistic activity is observed.

In contrast to pure spillover, portal site adsorption refers to surface diffusion to adjacent adsorption sites, not to non-adsorptive support surfaces.

The model appears to have been first proposed for carbon monoxide on silica-supported platinum by Brandt &quot;et al.&quot; (1993). A similar, but independent model was developed by King and co-workers to describe hydrogen adsorption on silica-supported alkali promoted ruthenium, silver-ruthenium and copper-ruthenium bimetallic catalysts. The same group applied the model to CO hydrogenation (Fischer–Tropsch synthesis). Zupanc &quot;et al.&quot; (2002) subsequently confirmed the same model for hydrogen adsorption on magnesia-supported caesium-ruthenium bimetallic catalysts. Trens &quot;et al.&quot; (2009) have similarly described CO surface diffusion on carbon-supported Pt particles of varying morphology.

==Adsorption spillover==

In the case catalytic or adsorbent systems where a metal species is dispersed upon a support (or carrier) material (often quasi-inert oxides, such as alumina or silica), it is possible for an adsorptive species to indirectly adsorb to the support surface under conditions where such adsorption is thermodynamically unfavorable. The presence of the metal serves as a lower-energy pathway for gaseous species to first adsorb to the metal and then diffuse on the support surface. This is possible because the adsorbed species attains a lower energy state once it has adsorbed to the metal, thus lowering the activation barrier between the gas phase species and the support-adsorbed species.

Hydrogen spillover is the most common example of an adsorptive spillover. In the case of hydrogen, adsorption is most often accompanied with dissociation of molecular hydrogen (H2) to atomic hydrogen (H), followed by spillover of the hydrogen atoms present.

The spillover effect has been used to explain many observations in heterogeneous catalysis and adsorption.

==Polymer adsorption==

Adsorption of molecules onto polymer surfaces is central to a number of applications, including development of non-stick coatings and in various biomedical devices. Polymers may also be adsorbed to surfaces through polyelectrolyte adsorption.

==In viruses==
Adsorption is the first step in the viral life cycle. The next steps are penetration, uncoating, synthesis (transcription if needed, and translation), and release. The virus replication cycle, in this respect, is similar for all types of viruses. Factors such as transcription may or may not be needed if the virus is able to integrate its genomic information in the cell&#x27;s nucleus, or if the virus can replicate itself directly within the cell&#x27;s cytoplasm.

==In popular culture==
The game of &quot;Tetris&quot; is a puzzle game in which blocks of 4 are adsorbed onto a surface during game play. Scientists have used &quot;Tetris&quot; blocks &quot;as a proxy for molecules with a complex shape&quot; and their &quot;adsorption on a flat surface&quot; for studying the thermodynamics of nanoparticles.

<doc id="207611" wikidata="Q700152" url="?curid=207611" title="Prince Laurent of Belgium">
<text>Prince Laurent of Belgium (Laurent Benoît Baudouin Marie de Saxe-Cobourg; born 19 October 1963) is the second son and youngest child of King Albert II and Queen Paola, and younger brother of King Philippe. Currently, he is 15th in the Belgian line of succession. He had been as high as third in line, but the constitution was amended in 1991 to extend an equal right of succession to women, putting him behind his sister, Princess Astrid, and her descendants.

Laurent&#x27;s involvement with animal welfare and the environment, together with his eccentric personality and relative lack of interest in protocol, has caused him to be dubbed by elements of the popular Belgian press as (the &quot;eco-blunderer&quot;).

==Early life and education==
Prince Laurent was born on 19 October 1963 at the Belvédère Château in Laeken, northern Brussels. He was educated at the Royal Cadet High School and at the Royal Military Academy.

==Marriage and children==
Prince Laurent and Claire Louise Coombs were married in Brussels on 12 April 2003. Coombs was also given the title of Princess of Belgium upon her marriage. The couple have three children, who are sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth in the line of succession to the throne respectively: 
*Princess Louise (born 6 February 2004)
*Prince Nicolas (born 13 December 2005, twin with Aymeric)
*Prince Aymeric (born 13 December 2005, twin with Nicolas)

The family live in &quot;Villa Clementine&quot;, in Tervuren.

Prince Laurent is also a godfather to Princess Maria Carolina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, the daughter of Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro, a current pretender to the former throne of Two Sicilies and his wife, Princess Camilla, Duchess of Castro.

==Alleged corruption scandal==
In December 2006, Prince Laurent&#x27;s name surfaced in a corruption scandal in which funds of the Belgian Navy were spent on his residence (Villa Clémentine) in Tervuren. Although the investigating magistrates denied that Laurent was personally implicated, some of the accused have implicated the prince in the press.

On 5 January 2007, it became known that King Albert II had signed a royal decree, making it possible for Laurent to be called up as a witness in the corruption trial which was to start 8 January. One of the defendants immediately used this to subpoena the prince. During the evening of 8 January, Prince Laurent was interrogated by federal police, appearing in court the following day where he testified at the trial that he had no reason to believe the funding of his renovations could be illegal.

Media reports in March 2007 suggested that Laurent was no longer welcome at the Royal Palace, possibly due to his role in the corruption scandal.

In March 2011, the prince visited the former Belgian colony of the Congo without receiving the required permission; the reported purpose of the visit was to promote awareness of deforestation. As a result, on 9 April he accepted conditions laid down by Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme regarding his future activities; had he not done so, the matter of his annual appanage would have been in question.

==Health==
In March 2014, Prince Laurent was hospitalised with pneumonia and depression. He was voluntarily placed in a medically-induced coma on March 25, and was awakened on 27 March. On 4 April, Queen Paola stated in a letter that Laurent&#x27;s condition was improving, and that she felt he was &#x27;the most vulnerable&#x27; of her three children.

==Titles, styles and honours==

* &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; Prince Laurent of Belgium

<doc id="207612" wikidata="Q1723437" url="?curid=207612" title="Canal through Walcheren">
<text>The Canal through Walcheren in the Netherlands crosses the east of Walcheren. It connects the Westerschelde and the Veerse Meer.

== Context ==
In the 15th and 16th century Middelburg, capital of Zeeland was booming. The city was on Walcheren Island, and had a connection to the sea just to the east via the small river Arne. In 1535 the Havenkanaal was opened, and Middelburg continued in prosperity. However, in the 17th and 18th century Middelburg&#x27;s connections to the sea all silted up. 

In 1809 King Louis Bonaparte decided to construct the New Harbor Canal, which connected Middelburg to Veere. After the annexation by France this work was halted. After independence was regained in 1813, work continued. It was made possible by a national subsidy (a loan without interest) of 1,000,000 guilders. Middelburg would repay 25,000 guilders a year. The canal was opened in August 1817, but the prosperity of Middelburg was not restored. 

== History ==

In 1871 the Sloedam was constructed for the Roosendaal–Vlissingen railway. The dam connected the islands Walcheren and Zuid-Beveland, and cut off the Sloe, which was the southern approach to Middelburg over water. Therefore, and to profit from the expected benefits of the railway, the new Canal through Walcheren was dug.

On the north side of Middelburg, the Canal through Walcheren follows the bed of the Havenkanaal (New Harbor Canal) of 1817. In Middelburg the canal passed along the fortifications. Here it led to the demolishment of the Vlissingen Gate. In Vlissingen the canal was connected to extensive new harbour works.

The railroad entering Walcheren from the east does not cross this canal, but bends south and runs along it up to Vlissingen.

== Today ==
The canal is operational for shipping up to CEMT-class Va and recreational boating as well, the maximum speed is . All movable bridges (5) and sluices are remote controlled from a central point in Vlissingen, to be contacted by VHF.
North of the bridges in Middelburg is a branch to the harbour of Arnemuiden for CEMT-class II boats and after a mile on that canal an other branch to the harbour of Nieuw- en Sint Joosland for CEMT-class 0.
Excess waters (rain) from a part of Walcheren is discharged on the canal by a pumping station in Middelburg.

<doc id="207615" wikidata="Q886894" url="?curid=207615" title="Ptolemy Apion">
<text>Ptolemy Apion or simply known as Apion (; between 150 BC and 145 BC – 96 BC) was the last Greek King of Cyrenaica who separated it from the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, and in his last will bequeathed his country to Rome. He was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty.

==Biography==
Apion was the son of Ptolemy VIII Physcon, king of Egypt (170-165, 145-132, and 127-116) and king of Cyrene and Cyprus (163-116 BC), by a concubine. Apion&#x27;s mother is often identified with Eirene, who was his mistress around 147 BC, but there is no evidence for this.

Ptolemy Apion was apparently given Cyrene as a separate kingdom ca. 105-101 BC. Nothing is recorded of Ptolemy&#x27;s reign of Cyrenaica. Some scholars have doubted that he ever actually reigned. Ptolemy died in 96 BC without heirs. In Ptolemy&#x27;s will, he left Cyrenaica and his ancestral royal estates to the rule of the Roman Republic.

<text>Willie Doherty (born 1959) is an artist from Northern Ireland, who has mainly worked in photography and video. He has twice been a Turner Prize nominee.

==Life and work==

Doherty was born in Derry, Northern Ireland, and was educated at St Columb&#x27;s College, Derry. From 1978 to 1981 he studied at Ulster Polytechnic in Belfast. As a child, he witnessed Bloody Sunday in Derry, and many of his works deal with The Troubles. Some of his pieces take images from the media and adapt them to his own ends.

These works by Doherty explore the multiple meanings that a single image can have. Doherty has suggested that this interest may stem from his witnessing of Bloody Sunday and subsequent knowledge that many photos of the incident did not tell the whole truth. Some of Doherty&#x27;s earliest works are of maps and similar images accompanied by texts in a manner similar to the land art of Richard Long, except that here the text sometimes seems to contradict the image.

Doherty&#x27;s video pieces are often projected in a confined space, giving a sense of claustrophobia. The videos themselves sometimes create a mood that has been compared to film noir.

Doherty has acknowledged the importance of the Orchard Gallery in Derry as a venue where he could see modern art in his formative years. He was a participant in Documenta (13).

==Critical reception==
Riann Coulter wrote in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; that &quot;Doherty is arguably the most significant Northern Irish artist of his generation.&quot; Aidan Dunne wrote in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; that Doherty has a &quot;big international reputation&quot; and that his exhibition in June 2013 at Art Basel had been &quot;impressive&quot;.

National Museums Northern Ireland&#x27;s Curator of Fine Art, Anne Stewart, said, &quot;The Ulster Museum has long admired Willie Doherty, in particular the profoundly affecting ways in which his work explores themes of identity, territoriality and surveillance. His work frequently involves the layering of text and image, which creates a sense of ambiguity and plays on the viewer&#x27;s prejudices and assumptions.”

<text>An elliptical galaxy is a type of galaxy with an approximately ellipsoidal shape and a smooth, nearly featureless image. They are one of the three main classes of galaxy described by Edwin Hubble in his Hubble sequence and 1936 work &quot;The Realm of the Nebulae&quot;, along with spiral and lenticular galaxies. 
Elliptical (E) galaxies are, together with lenticular galaxies (S0) with their large-scale disks, and ES galaxies with their intermediate scale disks, a subset of the &quot;early-type&quot; galaxy population.

Most elliptical galaxies are composed of older, low-mass stars, with a sparse interstellar medium, and they tend to be surrounded by large numbers of globular clusters. Star formation activity in elliptical galaxies is typically minimal; they may, however, undergo brief periods of star formation when merging with other galaxies. Elliptical galaxies are believed to make up approximately 10–15% of galaxies in the Virgo Supercluster, and they are not the dominant type of galaxy in the universe overall. They are preferentially found close to the centers of galaxy clusters.

Elliptical galaxies range in size from dwarf ellipticals with tens of millions of stars, to supergiants of over one hundred trillion stars that dominate their galaxy clusters. Originally, Edwin Hubble hypothesized that elliptical galaxies evolved into spiral galaxies, which was later discovered to be false, although the accretion of gas and smaller galaxies may build a disk around a pre-existing ellipsoidal structure.
Stars found inside of elliptical galaxies are on average much older than stars found in spiral galaxies.

*M49 (NGC 4472)
*M59 (NGC 4621)
*M60 (NGC 4649)
*M87 (NGC 4486), whose supermassive black hole was the first black hole to be imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope.
*M89 (NGC 4552)
*M105 (NGC 3379)
*NGC 4697, part of the NGC 4697 Group
*ESO 383-76, one of the largest galaxies known.
*IC 1101, the central galaxy of Abell 2029
*Hercules A, supergiant elliptical galaxy
*Maffei 1, the closest giant elliptical galaxy
*CGCG 049-033, known for having the longest galactic jet discovered
*Centaurus A (NGC 5128), an elliptical/lenticular radio galaxy with peculiar morphology and unusual dust lanes
*NeVe 1, the source of the Ophiuchus Supercluster eruption, the most powerful astronomical event known
*M86 (4406) an elliptical or lenticular galaxy in the constellation Virgo

== General characteristics ==
Elliptical galaxies are characterized by several properties that make them distinct from other classes of galaxy. They are spherical or ovoid masses of stars, starved of star-making gases. Furthermore, there is very little interstellar matter (neither gas nor dust), which results in low rates of star formation, few open star clusters, and few young stars; rather elliptical galaxies are dominated by old stellar populations, giving them red colors. Large elliptical galaxies typically have an extensive system of globular clusters. They generally have two distinct populations of globular clusters: one that is redder and metal-rich, and another that is bluer and metal-poor.

The dynamical properties of elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disk galaxies are similar, suggesting that they may be formed by the same physical processes, although this remains controversial. The luminosity profiles of both elliptical galaxies and bulges are well fit by Sersic&#x27;s law, and a range of scaling relations between the elliptical galaxies&#x27; structural parameters unify the population.

Every massive elliptical galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center. Observations of 46 elliptical galaxies, 20 classical bulges, and 22 pseudobulges show that each contain a black hole at the center. The mass of the black hole is tightly correlated with the mass of the galaxy, evidenced through correlations such as the M–sigma relation which relates the velocity dispersion of the surrounding stars to the mass of the black hole at the center.

Elliptical galaxies are preferentially found in galaxy clusters and in compact groups of galaxies.

Unlike flat spiral galaxies with organization and structure, elliptical galaxies are more three-dimensional, without much structure, and their stars are in somewhat random orbits around the center.

==Sizes and shapes==

The largest galaxies are supergiant ellipticals, or type-cD galaxies. Elliptical galaxies vary greatly in both size and mass with diameters ranging from 3,000 light years to more than 700,000 light years, and masses from 105 to nearly 1013 solar masses. This range is much broader for this galaxy type than for any other. The smallest, the dwarf elliptical galaxies, may be no larger than a typical globular cluster, but contain a considerable amount of dark matter not present in clusters. Most of these small galaxies may not be related to other ellipticals.

The Hubble classification of elliptical galaxies contains an integer that describes how elongated the galaxy image is.
The classification is determined by the ratio of the major (&quot;a&quot;) to the minor (&quot;b&quot;) axes of the galaxy&#x27;s isophotes:

:formula_1

Thus for a spherical galaxy with &quot;a&quot; equal to &quot;b&quot;, the number
is 0, and the Hubble type is E0. While the limit in the literature is about E7, it has been known since 1966 that the E4 to E7 galaxies are misclassified lenticular galaxies with disks inclined at different angles to our line of sight. This has been confirmed through spectral observations revealing the rotation of their stellar disks. Hubble recognized that his shape classification depends both on the intrinsic shape of the galaxy, as well as the angle with which the galaxy is observed. Hence, some galaxies with Hubble type E0 are actually elongated.

It is sometimes said that there are two physical types of ellipticals: the giant ellipticals with slightly &quot;boxy&quot;-shaped isophotes, whose shapes result from random motion which is greater in some directions than in others (anisotropic random motion); and the &quot;disky&quot; normal and dwarf ellipticals, which contain disks. This is, however, an abuse of the nomenclature, as there are two types of early-type galaxy, those with disks and those without. Given the existence of ES galaxies with intermediate-scale disks, it is reasonable to expect that there is a continuity from E to ES, and onto the S0 galaxies with their large-scale stellar disks that dominate the light at large radii.

Dwarf spheroidal galaxies appear to be a distinct class: their properties are more similar to those of irregulars and late spiral-type galaxies.

At the large end of the elliptical spectrum, there is further division, beyond Hubble&#x27;s classification. Beyond &quot;gE&quot; giant ellipticals, lies D-galaxies and cD-galaxies. These are similar to their smaller brethren, but more diffuse, with large haloes that may as much belong to the galaxy cluster within which they reside than the centrally-located giant galaxy.

==Star formation==
In recent years, evidence has shown that a reasonable proportion (~25%) of early-type (E, ES and S0) galaxies have residual gas reservoirs
and low-level star formation.

Herschel Space Observatory researchers have speculated that the central black holes in elliptical galaxies keep the gas from cooling enough for star formation.

<text>Spiral galaxies form a class of galaxy originally described by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 work &quot;The Realm of the Nebulae&quot; and, as such, form part of the Hubble sequence. Most spiral galaxies consist of a flat, rotating disk containing stars, gas and dust, and a central concentration of stars known as the bulge. These are often surrounded by a much fainter halo of stars, many of which reside in globular clusters.

Spiral galaxies are named by their spiral structures that extend from the center into the galactic disc. The spiral arms are sites of ongoing star formation and are brighter than the surrounding disc because of the young, hot OB stars that inhabit them.

Roughly two-thirds of all spirals are observed to have an additional component in the form of a bar-like structure, extending from the central bulge, at the ends of which the spiral arms begin. The proportion of barred spirals relative to barless spirals has likely changed over the history of the universe, with only about 10% containing bars about 8 billion years ago, to roughly a quarter 2.5 billion years ago, until present, where over two-thirds of the galaxies in the visible universe (Hubble volume) have bars.

The Milky Way is a barred spiral, although the bar itself is difficult to observe from Earth&#x27;s current position within the galactic disc. The most convincing evidence for the stars forming a bar in the Galactic Center comes from several recent surveys, including the Spitzer Space Telescope.

Together with irregular galaxies, spiral galaxies make up approximately 60% of galaxies in today&#x27;s universe. They are mostly found in low-density regions and are rare in the centers of galaxy clusters.

==Structure==

Spiral galaxies may consist of several distinct components:
* A flat, rotating disc of stars and interstellar matter of which spiral arms are prominent components
* A central stellar bulge of mainly older stars, which resembles an elliptical galaxy
* A bar-shaped distribution of stars
* A near-spherical halo of stars, including many in globular clusters
* A supermassive black hole at the very center of the bulge
* A near-spherical dark matter halo

The relative importance, in terms of mass, brightness and size, of the different components varies from galaxy to galaxy.

=== Spiral arms ===

&quot;Spiral arms&quot; are regions of stars that extend from the center of barred and unbarred spiral galaxies. These long, thin regions resemble a spiral and thus give spiral galaxies their name. Naturally, different classifications of spiral galaxies have distinct arm-structures. Sc and SBc galaxies, for instance, have very &quot;loose&quot; arms, whereas Sa and SBa galaxies have tightly wrapped arms (with reference to the Hubble sequence). Either way, spiral arms contain many young, blue stars (due to the high mass density and the high rate of star formation), which make the arms so bright.

=== Bulge ===

A &quot;bulge&quot; is a large, tightly packed group of stars. The term refers to the central group of stars found in most spiral galaxies, often defined as the excess of stellar light above the inward extrapolation of the outer (exponential) disk light.

Using the Hubble classification, the bulge of Sa galaxies is usually composed of Population II stars, which are old, red stars with low metal content. Further, the bulge of Sa and SBa galaxies tends to be large. In contrast, the bulges of Sc and SBc galaxies are much smaller and are composed of young, blue Population I stars. Some bulges have similar properties to those of elliptical galaxies (scaled down to lower mass and luminosity); others simply appear as higher density centers of disks, with properties similar to disk galaxies.

Many bulges are thought to host a supermassive black hole at their centers. In our own galaxy, for instance, the object called Sagittarius A* is a supermassive black hole. There are many lines of evidence for the existence of black holes in spiral galaxy centers, including the presence of active nuclei in some spiral galaxies, and dynamical measurements that find large compact central masses in galaxies such as Messier 106.

=== Bar ===

Bar-shaped elongations of stars are observed in roughly two-thirds of all spiral galaxies. Their presence may be either strong or weak. In edge-on spiral (and lenticular) galaxies, the presence of the bar can sometimes be discerned by the out-of-plane X-shaped or (peanut shell)-shaped structures which typically have a maximum visibility at half the length of the in-plane bar.

=== Spheroid ===
The bulk of the stars in a spiral galaxy are located either close to a single plane (the galactic plane) in more or less conventional circular orbits around the center of the galaxy (the Galactic Center), or in a spheroidal galactic bulge around the galactic core.

However, some stars inhabit a &quot;spheroidal halo&quot; or &quot;galactic spheroid&quot;, a type of galactic halo. The orbital behaviour of these stars is disputed, but they may exhibit retrograde and/or highly inclined orbits, or not move in regular orbits at all. Halo stars may be acquired from small galaxies which fall into and merge with the spiral galaxy—for example, the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy is in the process of merging with the Milky Way and observations show that some stars in the halo of the Milky Way have been acquired from it.

Unlike the galactic disc, the halo seems to be free of dust, and in further contrast, stars in the galactic halo are of Population II, much older and with much lower metallicity than their Population I cousins in the galactic disc (but similar to those in the galactic bulge). The galactic halo also contains many globular clusters.

The motion of halo stars does bring them through the disc on occasion, and a number of small red dwarfs close to the Sun are thought to belong to the galactic halo, for example Kapteyn&#x27;s Star and Groombridge 1830. Due to their irregular movement around the center of the galaxy, these stars often display unusually high proper motion.

===Oldest spiral galaxies===
BRI 1335-0417 is the oldest and most distant known spiral galaxy, as of 2024. The galaxy has a redshift of 4.4, meaning its light took 12.4 billion years to reach Earth.

The oldest grand design spiral galaxy on file is BX442. At eleven billion years old, it is more than two billion years older than any previous discovery. Researchers believe the galaxy&#x27;s shape is caused by the gravitational influence of a companion dwarf galaxy. Computer models based on that assumption indicate that BX442&#x27;s spiral structure will last about 100 million years.

The oldest multi-arm spiral galaxy, as of 2022, is A2744-DSG-z3. Its redshift is z=3.059, which corresponds to 11.5 billion light years to Earth.

A1689B11 is an extremely old spiral galaxy located in the Abell 1689 galaxy cluster in the Virgo constellation. A1689B11 is 11 billion light years from the Earth, forming 2.6 billion years after the Big Bang.

In June 2019, citizen scientists through Galaxy Zoo reported that the usual Hubble classification, particularly concerning spiral galaxies, may not be supported, and may need updating.

==Origin of the spiral structure==

===History===
The pioneer of studies of the rotation of the Galaxy and the formation of the spiral arms was Bertil Lindblad in 1925. He realized that the idea of stars arranged permanently in a spiral shape was untenable. Since the angular speed of rotation of the galactic disk varies with distance from the centre of the galaxy (via a standard solar system type of gravitational model), a radial arm (like a spoke) would quickly become curved as the galaxy rotates. The arm would, after a few galactic rotations, become increasingly curved and wind around the galaxy ever tighter. This is called the &quot;winding problem&quot;. Measurements in the late 1960s showed that the orbital velocity of stars in spiral galaxies with respect to their distance from the galactic center is indeed higher than expected from Newtonian dynamics but still cannot explain the stability of the spiral structure.

Since the 1970s, there have been two leading hypotheses or models for the spiral structures of galaxies:
* star formation caused by density waves in the galactic disk of the galaxy.
* the stochastic self-propagating star formation model (SSPSF model) – star formation caused by shock waves in the interstellar medium. The shock waves are caused by the stellar winds and supernovae from recent previous star formation, leading to self-propagating and self-sustaining star formation. Spiral structure then arises from differential rotation of the galaxy&#x27;s disk.

These different hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, as they may explain different types of spiral arms.

===Density wave model===
Bertil Lindblad proposed that the arms represent regions of enhanced density (density waves) that rotate more slowly than the galaxy&#x27;s stars and gas. As gas enters a density wave, it gets squeezed and makes new stars, some of which are short-lived blue stars that light the arms.

====Historical theory of Lin and Shu====

The first acceptable theory for the spiral structure was devised by C. C. Lin and Frank Shu in 1964, attempting to explain the large-scale structure of spirals in terms of a small-amplitude wave propagating with fixed angular velocity, that revolves around the galaxy at a speed different from that of the galaxy&#x27;s gas and stars. They suggested that the spiral arms were manifestations of spiral density waves – they assumed that the stars travel in slightly elliptical orbits, and that the orientations of their orbits is correlated i.e. the ellipses vary in their orientation (one to another) in a smooth way with increasing distance from the galactic center. This is illustrated in the diagram to the right. It is clear that the elliptical orbits come close together in certain areas to give the effect of arms. Stars therefore do not remain forever in the position that we now see them in, but pass through the arms as they travel in their orbits.

====Star formation caused by density waves====
The following hypotheses exist for star formation caused by density waves:
* As gas clouds move into the density wave, the local mass density increases. Since the criteria for cloud collapse (the Jeans instability) depends on density, a higher density makes it more likely for clouds to collapse and form stars.
* As the compression wave goes through, it triggers star formation on the leading edge of the spiral arms.
* As clouds get swept up by the spiral arms, they collide with one another and drive shock waves through the gas, which in turn causes the gas to collapse and form stars.

===More young stars in spiral arms===
Spiral arms appear visually brighter because they contain both young stars and more massive and luminous stars than the rest of the galaxy. As massive stars evolve far more quickly, their demise tends to leave a darker background of fainter stars immediately behind the density waves. This make the density waves much more prominent.

Spiral arms simply appear to pass through the older established stars as they travel in their galactic orbits, so they also do not necessarily follow the arms. As stars move through an arm, the space velocity of each stellar system is modified by the gravitational force of the local higher density. Also the newly created stars do not remain forever fixed in the position within the spiral arms, where the average space velocity returns to normal after the stars depart on the other side of the arm.

===Gravitationally aligned orbits===
Charles Francis and Erik Anderson showed from observations of motions of over 20,000 local stars (within 300 parsecs) that stars do move along spiral arms, and described how mutual gravity between stars causes orbits to align on logarithmic spirals. When the theory is applied to gas, collisions between gas clouds generate the molecular clouds in which new stars form, and evolution towards grand-design bisymmetric spirals is explained.

== Distribution of stars in spirals ==

The stars in spirals are distributed in thin disks radial with intensity profiles such that
:formula_1
with formula_2 being the disk scale-length; formula_3 is the central value; it is useful to define: formula_4 as the size of the stellar disk, whose luminosity is

formula_5.

The spiral galaxies light profiles, in terms of the coordinate formula_6, do not depend on galaxy luminosity.

==Spiral nebula==

Before it was understood that spiral galaxies existed outside of our Milky Way galaxy, they were often referred to as &quot;spiral nebulae&quot;, due to Lord Rosse, whose telescope Leviathan was the first to reveal the spiral structure of galaxies. In 1845 he discovered the spiral structure of M51, a galaxy nicknamed later as the &quot;Whirlpool Galaxy&quot;, and his drawings of it closely resemble modern photographs. In 1846 and in 1849 Lord Rosse identified similar pattern in Messier 99 and Messier 33 respectively. In 1850 he made the first drawing of Andromeda Galaxy&#x27;s spiral structure. In 1852 Stephen Alexander supposed that Milky Way is also a spiral nebula.

The question of whether such objects were separate galaxies independent of the Milky Way, or a type of nebula existing within our own galaxy, was the subject of the Great Debate of 1920, between Heber Curtis of Lick Observatory and Harlow Shapley of Mount Wilson Observatory. Beginning in 1923, Edwin Hubble observed Cepheid variables in several spiral nebulae, including the so-called &quot;Andromeda Nebula&quot;, proving that they are, in fact, entire galaxies outside our own. The term &quot;spiral nebula&quot; has since fallen out of use.

==Milky Way==

The Milky Way was once considered an ordinary spiral galaxy. Astronomers first began to suspect that the Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy in the 1960s. Their suspicions were confirmed by Spitzer Space Telescope observations in 2005, which showed that the Milky Way&#x27;s central bar is larger than what was previously suspected.

<text>An irregular galaxy is a galaxy that does not have a distinct regular shape, unlike a spiral or an elliptical galaxy. Irregular galaxies do not fall into any of the regular classes of the Hubble sequence, and they are often chaotic in appearance, with neither a nuclear bulge nor any trace of spiral arm structure. This absence of structure in an irregular galaxy leads to little density waves in these galaxies. This makes irregular galaxies prime areas to study star formation without the effects of density waves.

Collectively they are thought to make up about a quarter of all galaxies. Some irregular galaxies were once spiral or elliptical galaxies but were deformed by an uneven external gravitational force. Irregular galaxies may contain abundant amounts of gas and dust. This is not necessarily true for dwarf irregulars. Irregular galaxies may also be formed in galaxy collisions.

Irregular galaxies are commonly small, about one tenth the mass of the Milky Way galaxy, though there are also unusual cases of large irregulars like UGC 6697. Due to their small sizes, they are prone to environmental effects like colliding with large galaxies and intergalactic clouds.

==Types==
There are three major types of irregular galaxies:

* An Irr-I galaxy (Irr I) is an irregular galaxy that features some structure but not enough to place it cleanly into the Hubble sequence. 
**Subtypes with some spiral structure are called Sm galaxies
**Subtypes without spiral structure are called Im galaxies.

* An Irr-II galaxy (Irr II) is an irregular galaxy that does not appear to feature any structure that can place it into the Hubble sequence.
* A dI-galaxy (or dIrr) is a dwarf irregular galaxy. This type of galaxy is now thought to be important to understand the overall evolution of galaxies, as they tend to have a low level of metallicity and relatively high levels of gas, and are thought to be similar to the earliest galaxies that populated the Universe. They may represent a local (and therefore more recent) version of the faint blue galaxies known to exist in deep field galaxy surveys. These types of irregular galaxies also have high amounts of dark matter. 

Irregular galaxies are considered late-type along with spiral galaxies as opposed to early type elliptical galaxies. 

Some of the irregular galaxies, especially of the Magellanic type, are small spiral galaxies that are being distorted by the gravity of a larger neighbor.

==Magellanic Clouds==

The Magellanic Cloud galaxies were once classified as irregular galaxies. The Large Magellanic Cloud has since been re-classified as type SBm (barred Magellanic spiral). The Small Magellanic Cloud remains classified as an irregular galaxy of type Im under current galaxy morphological classification, although it does contain a bar structure.

<text>Sean Scully (born 30 June 1945) is an Irish-born American-based artist working as a painter, printmaker, sculptor and photographer. His work is held in museum collections worldwide and he has twice been named a Turner Prize nominee. Moving from London to New York in 1975, Scully helped lead the transition from Minimalism to Emotional abstraction in painting, abandoning the reduced vocabulary of Minimalism in favour of a return to metaphor and spirituality in art.

Scully has also been a lecturer and professor at a number of universities and his writing and teachings are collected in the 2016 book, &quot;Inner: The Collected Writings and Selected Interviews of Sean Scully.&quot;

==Early life==
Sean Scully was born in Dublin, Ireland, on 30 June 1945. Four years later his family moved to London where they lived in a working-class part of south London, moving from lodging to lodging for a number of years. By the age of 9, Scully knew he wanted to become an artist, and from the age of 15 until he was 17, Scully was apprenticed at a commercial printing shop in London as a typesetter, an experience that greatly influenced the art to come.

From the age of 17 until he turned 20, despite working full-time in various jobs including graphic design, and messenger, Scully attended evening classes at the Central School of Art, focused on figurative painting. While working a stint as a plasterer&#x27;s labourer on the Victoria Station Ballroom, Scully made daily visits to the Tate Milbank to visit Van Gogh&#x27;s Chair (1888), which made an impression on him. In 1963, at the age of 18, Scully had a job loading trucks with flattened boxes at a cardboard factory. The idea of stacking central to much of his work came from this experience.

=== Education ===
In September 1965 Sean Scully, age 20, began to study full-time at Croydon College of Art, London, before moving on to Newcastle University in 1968. At Newcastle University, the University Theatre&#x27;s production of Samuel Beckett’s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; made a lasting impact on him. Scully was also influenced by a trip to Morocco in 1969, where he became fascinated by the multi-colored stripes locals wove into wool tents and robes. Scully was awarded the Frank Knox Memorial Fellowship in 1972 to attend Harvard University. It was during this first stay in the US that Scully began to experiment with new techniques such as tape and spray paint.

== Career ==

=== Early career: 1970–1980 ===
Scully&#x27;s first commercial show, at the Rowan Gallery in London, sold out. During this period Scully taught at the Chelsea College of Art and Design, and Goldsmith&#x27;s, while continuing to paint in his Elephant Lane studio in Rotherhithe. In 1975, at the age of 30, Scully was awarded a two-year Harkness Fellowship with which he moved to New York.

Once in New York, he began to develop important friendships with fellow artists such as Robert Ryman, and others in academic and artistic circles. Scully&#x27;s response in the 1970s had been to bring the objectives of American Minimalism together with those of Op art, an important current in Europe, creating works using overlays and “supergrids” that bridged these two artistic movements in a new way. Once in New York, Minimalism had a strong influence on his work, and for a few years, Scully&#x27;s palette was reduced to the grey monochrome ‘Black paintings’ series.

Scully began working on the series known as &quot;The Catherine Paintings&quot; in 1979, while sharing his Duane Street studio with his third wife, the artist Catherine Lee. The idea behind the series was to choose the important painting Scully produced during each year together, that would then become part of a collection named after her. This was the beginning of Sean&#x27;s own private collection of his work.

=== Departure from Minimalism: 1980–1982 ===

By 1980 Scully considered himself to be at war with the movement of Minimalism in New York and wanted to bring more human elements into his art. He made multiple trips to Morocco and Mexico during this time, as he considered these trips to have “a direct bearing on what I think art should be doing – which is concentrating on what’s interesting, engaging, perverse, and beautiful about human nature.” He later commented that “I had decided that what had been stripped out of painting—i.e., the ability to make relationships, to be metaphorical and referential, spiritual, poetic, all those things and aspects of human nature—had to be put back in if painting was to go forward.”
In 1981 the first retrospective of Sean Scully&#x27;s work was held at the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham. This was also the year that Scully&#x27;s confidence to withdraw from adherence to Minimalism became apparent, with the return of color and space, and the freehand drawing of stripes and visible brushstrokes, rather than the hard lines of tape. Scully had a breakthrough with the seminal 1981 painting &quot;Backs and Fronts&quot;, which had a profound impact in the 1982 exhibition &#x27;Critical Perspectives&#x27; at the PS1 Contemporary Art Center. This was a watershed painting which British conceptual artist Gillian Wearing has said “broke the logjam of American minimalist painting”.

=== Geometric Abstraction: 1982–present ===
In 1982 Scully began to work with the gallerist David McKee, an important relationship that lasted for a decade. During the summer of that year, Scully started producing small multi-panel works on found pieces of wood while staying in Montauk at the Edward Albee artist&#x27;s colony. These works were titled &quot;Ridge&quot;, &quot;Plum&quot;, and &quot;Bear&quot; after the islands that surround Long Island. He also began applying a combination of rigid geometry and expressive texture and colour to larger paintings that year. A prime example of this was &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, inspired by the 1899 novella of the same name. Scully began collaborating with Mohammad O. Khalil in 1983, this was the first time he had collaborated with a printmaker and was the start of a career-long commitment to printmaking. That same year, Scully was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts. 

In 1984, the Museum of Modern Art included Scully in their International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture. The following year Scully&#x27;s first American solo museum exhibition was held at the Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute in 1985, and traveled to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Other major museums also began to acquire Scully&#x27;s large-scale paintings, despite the dominant trend of the time tending towards Postmodernism. Scully&#x27;s paintings from this period are heavy and physical in terms of both size and aesthetic, and make use of large-scale stretchers.

By 1987, Scully&#x27;s work became less complex, flatter and smaller in scale, and began to include lighter color palettes beginning with &quot;Pale Fire&quot; in 1988. The same year, while experimenting with watercolours on a beach in Mexico, Scully created the first image that would become an extended meditation on architecture and light with the &quot;Wall of Light&quot; series. In 1989 the Whitechapel Gallery in London held a solo exhibition for Scully, which then travelled to Palacio Velázquez in Madrid and to the Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus in Munich. These were Scully&#x27;s first solo exhibitions in mainland Europe. The art critic Robert Hughes&#x27; 1989 piece for TIME magazine cemented Scully&#x27;s increasing reputation.

The painting &quot;Why and What (Yellow)&quot; in 1988 was the first to incorporate an inset element of steel. By 1991 Scully expanded the use of steel, setting oil on linen insets into large steel panels. He also began the regular use of a checkerboard motif at this time, first hinted at in his &quot;Taped and Hidden Drawing&quot; paintings of the mid-1970s. In 1992, while teaching at Harvard University, Sean Scully revisited Morocco to film the BBC documentary &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Journey: Sean Scully on Henri Matisse&quot;, with Matisse having visited Morocco in 1912 - 1913. 1993 saw the first exhibition of &quot;The Catherine Paintings&quot;, at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas. In 1994 he opened a second studio in Barcelona, and he returned to Morocco in 1995, to spend more time in the country. &quot;Atlas Walls&quot; is a portfolio of Scully&#x27;s photographic works taken during this trip.

In 1995 Scully returned to New York, moving into a large new studio in Chelsea, Manhattan. &quot;Chelsea Wall&quot; was the first painting to be made there. Scully received a number of invitations to speak at academic institutions, and participated in the Joseph Beuys lectures on the state of contemporary art in Britain, Europe and the US, held by the Ruskin School at Oxford University, England. In 1997, Scully&#x27;s photography was exhibited for the first time at the Sala de Exposiciones Rekalde in Bilbao, Spain.

Scully participated in a colloquium in conjunction with the exhibition Richard Pousette-Dart at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1998. He visited Santo Domingo in 1999, resulting in the photography portfolio &quot;Santa Domingo for Nené&quot;. That year, Scully&#x27;s prints were given a retrospective at the Graphische Sammlung Albertina, in Vienna, Austria, and the Musée du Dessin et de l’Estampe Originale in Gravelines. A catalogue raisonné of his prints from 1969 - 1999 was also published.

=== 2001 - 2013 ===
In 2001, the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth acquired the complete &quot;Catherine&quot; series, eighteen paintings that each represent a year from the period 1979–1996, which was given a dedicated room for permanent exhibition in the new Museum building opened in 2002. In 2002 Scully was appointed Professor of Painting at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, a position he held through to 2007. A retrospective exhibition opened in 2004 at the Sara Hildén Art Museum in Tampere, Finland, which travelled to Klassik Stiftung Weimar, in Germany, and the National Gallery of Australia. While in Australia, Scully spent time travelling through the red desert interior. 

Between 2005 - 2006, Sean Scully&#x27;s &quot;Wall of Light&quot; series was displayed at museums around the United States. This began with the exhibition &quot;Sean Scully: Wall of Light&quot; opened at The Phillips Collection, Washington D.C., and travelled to the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, the Cincinnati Art Museum, and finally the Metropolitan Museum of Fine Art to great acclaim. The same year Scully travelled with a group of students from the Art Academy in Munich, to Inisheer, an island off the Irish coast. It was here that the &quot;Aran&quot; portfolio of photographs were taken. In 2006 the Hugh Lane Gallery opened &quot;The Sean Scully Room&quot;, a dedicated, permanent installation of the artist&#x27;s work, and the Bibliothèque nationale de France held an exhibition of his prints. &quot;Sean Scully: A Retrospective&quot; opened in 2007 at the Fundació Joan Miró, Barcelona, and travelled to the Musée d&#x27;art moderne (Saint-Étienne), and the Museo d’Arte Contemporanea Roma (MACRO) in Rome. The National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. invited Scully to give the Elson Lecture in 2007.

The retrospective exhibition &quot;Constantinople or the Sensual Concealed: The Imagery of Sean Scully&quot; opened in 2009 at the MKM Museum Küppersmühlefür Moderne Kunst, in Duisburg, Germany, and travelled to the Ulster Museum, Belfast. In 2010 a tour of important early works from the 1980s started at the Centre for Contemporary Arts, Carlow, Ireland, and then travelled to the Leeds Art Gallery, and the Wilhelm-Hack-Museum in Ludwigshafen am Rhein. In 2011 the Chazen Museum of Art opened their new expansion of the museum with a solo exhibition of Scully&#x27;s eight-part &quot;Liliane&quot; paintings on aluminum, and other works. Scully opened nine more solo museum exhibitions in 2012, including &quot;Notations: Sean Scully&quot; at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, as well as exhibitions at museums like MIMA, Kunstmuseum Bern, the Lentos Kunstmuseum in Linz, and IVAM in Valencia, Spain.

=== Reception in China and new projects: 2014–2017 ===
In 2014, Scully opened a new studio space set on three acres in Tappan, New York, where he continued to extend the &quot;Landline&quot; series of paintings begun in 2000. That same year, Scully opened fourteen solo exhibitions around the world, including the first major retrospective by a western artist in China. The exhibition, entitled &quot;Follow the Heart: The Art of Sean Scully&quot;, opened in Beijing. The exhibition included &quot;China Piled-Up&quot;, a new monumental sculpture in corten-steel, and travelled from the Shanghai Himalayas Museum to the CAFA Art Museum in Beijing, to critical acclaim. Another outdoor sculpture &quot;Boxes Full of Air&quot; was commissioned at Chateau La Coste in France.
Scully participated in the Venice Biennale for the first time, in 2015, with the solo exhibition &quot;Land Sea&quot; at the Palazzo Falier in Venice. The Museum Liaunig, in Neuhaus, Austria, opened its new building expansion with &quot;Sean Scully: Painting as an Imaginative World Appropriation&quot;. To honour his long-term friendship with art critic Arthur Danto who died in 2013, Scully published the book &quot;Danto on Scully,&quot; bringing together the series of five essays Danto had written on the artist over the previous 20 years.

In 2015 Scully completed his restoration of the 10th Church of Santa Cecília de Montserrat in Spain, and opened it to the public. Commissioned by the Museum of Montserrat to make a holistic artistic intervention in the sacred space, Scully not only permanently installed paintings but worked on site-specific frescoes, and the design of the altar and cross. The chapel is now both a working church, and also the &quot;Espai d’Art Sean Scully&quot;. Scully was awarded the &quot;V Congreso Asociacion Protecturi&quot; for his contribution to Spanish religious heritage

In 2016 Scully&#x27;s second major exhibition in China, &quot;Sean Scully: Resistance and Persistence&quot;, opened at the Art Museum of the Nanjing University of the Arts, and travelled to the Guangdong Museum and the Hubei Museum in Wuhan. In the same year, as well as solo museum exhibitions in České Budějovice, Czech Republic, and Valencia, Spain, the artist put together two exhibitions of works from specific early periods in his private collection, one of works from the 1970s, in an off-site space in Ridgewood, Queens with Cheim &amp; Read, and another of works from the 1980s with Mnuchin Gallery. Inspired by revisiting his earlier works, Scully began to reemploy techniques such as spray painting, which he first introduced in the late 1960s.

Over the course of 2015–2017, Scully&#x27;s work expanded in two particular directions: sculpture and figuration. During this period, Scully began working on sculptural projects, including the &quot;Tower&quot; series using various materials such as corten steel, marble, and stainless steel, and the &quot;Stack&quot; series in both raw and painted steel were introduced. A new series of &quot;Block&quot; paintings was begun, in which Scully self-referenced his sculpture in paint. This new direction was the focus of the solo exhibition &quot;Wall of Light Cubed&quot; at Cheim &amp; Read, NY. Scully also revisited his early exploration in figuration from the late 1960s in a series of figurative paintings titled &quot;Eleuthera&quot; which was completed between 2015 and 2017. The series was inspired by Scully&#x27;s son Oisin, and was named after the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas and the feminine Greek adjective (&quot;eleútheros&quot;), meaning &quot;free&quot;.

=== 2018 ===
2018 saw Scully have a total of fourteen public exhibitions around the world. This included the installation of the monumental sculpture &quot;Boxes of Air&quot; in the Cuadra San Cristóbal, in Mexico City, along with paintings installed in the horse stalls of the iconic pink stable block. Other museum shows included: Multimedia Art Museum, Moscow; Hatton and Laing Galleries, Newcastle, UK; De Pont Museum of Contemporary Art, Tilburg, Netherlands; Russian Museum, St Petersburg, Russia; Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, Germany; Yorkshire Sculpture Park, UK, among many others.

In 2019, the exhibition &quot;Sean Scully: Sea Star&quot; opened at The National Gallery, London, showcasing Scully&#x27;s work alongside works by J. M. W. Turner. On 6 April 2019, director Nick Willing&#x27;s documentary film Unstoppable. Sean Scully &amp; The Art of Everything aired nationally in the UK on BBC Two. For the 58th Venice Biennale, Scully presented &quot;Sean Scully: Human&quot; at the Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore, an exhibition of recent paintings and a new sculpture titled &quot;Opulent Ascension&quot; under the dome of the late Renaissance church by Andrea Palladio.

== Critical reception ==
Arthur Danto wrote that “Sean Scully’s name belongs on the shortest of short lists of the major painters of our time”, continuing that “Scully’s historical importance lies in the way he has brought the great achievement of Abstract Expressionist painting into the contemporary moment - and in a way overcome the terms of the paragon that sent painting into exile.”

=== Prizes and awards ===
Scully has been a member of Aosdána since 2001, and the Royal Academy of Arts since 2013. Scully received an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from both Massachusetts College of Art and the National University of Ireland in 2003, and a Doctor of Letters degree from Newcastle University. He received an Honorary Doctorate from Miguel Hernández University in 2006 and 2008.
== Other works ==

=== Music ===
Scully&#x27;s mother Holly was a Vaudeville singer, and Sean Scully became heavily influenced by rhythm and blues in his adolescence. Scully owned and ran an R&amp;B Club as a teenager in South London, and was briefly in an R&amp;B band with his brother and a friend.

In 2016 the percussionist Billy Martin from the band Medeski Martin &amp; Wood made a performative collaboration with Sean Scully&#x27;s monumental corten steel sculpture &quot;Boxes of Air&quot; at Scully&#x27;s Tappan studio. It culminated in ‘Boxing for Sean’, a 6 movement percussion composition performed live outdoors.

In 2019 the duo Merzouga released a 46&#x27; sound composition &quot;The Language of Light - Music to the Work of Sean Scully&quot; (YLE/DLF 2019) featuring the texts and the voice of Sean Scully. Its premiere broadcast was on 3 December 2019 at 9 pm local time on Finnish broadcaster Yleisradio. German nationwide broadcaster Deutschlandfunk co-produced the piece, the German broadcast was scheduled for February 2020

=== Writing ===
Scully first began writing about art and his own work in the 1980s, although he only truly began to include writing as part of his practice from 1996 onwards. 2016 saw the publication of &quot;Inner: the collected writings and selected interviews of Sean Scully&quot;, by HatjeCantz

== Personal life ==
Scully became a father at the age of 19, with the birth of his son Paul on 7 May 1965. Paul later died in a car accident in 1983 at the age of 18. While at Newcastle University, Scully met Rosemary Purnell, a fellow student in the Painting Department, they married in 1971 and later divorced. Scully married artist Catherine Lee in 1978, the two divorced in 1998. In 2006, he married artist Liliane Tomasko, his fourth wife. Their son Oisin Scully was born in 2009.

* “Art, especially abstraction: has to be a moral act. If not it’s likely to fall into bed with decoration.”
* “Why stripes? Because they can be anything. And they can be anything because they are nothing. To make nothing into something is more interesting that making something into something else. The association with the devil notwithstanding”
* “Artistic culture, to me, is like a huge rug that is constantly folded and unfolded by us. Every time it’s turned over, turned out, unfolded: it shows something new or something overlooked that now seems new.”

<text>Hongwu (; 23 January 1368 – 5 February 1399) was the era name (&quot;nianhao&quot;) of the Hongwu Emperor (reigned 1368–1398), the Chinese emperor who founded the Ming dynasty that ruled China from 1368 to 1644. It was also the first era name of the Ming.

On 23 January 1368 (Wu 2, 4th day of the 1st month), Zhu Yuanzhang proclaimed himself emperor of the Great Ming dynasty in Yingtian Prefecture, with the era name &quot;Hongwu&quot;. During the Hongwu period, there was no war in the country, and society quickly recovered from the war in the late Yuan dynasty. The population increased rapidly and the economy developed quickly. This period is known in historiography as the &quot;Reign of Hongwu&quot; (洪武之治).

The emperors only used one era name during their reigns since the Hongwu Emperor began to form a practice. (Emperor Yingzong of Ming had two era names due to his abdication and later restoration, while the rest used one era name.) This was known as the &quot;yī shì yī yuán zhì&quot; (一世一元制; lit. &quot;one-era-name-for-a-lifetime system&quot;).

On 24 June 1398 (Hongwu 31, 10th day of the 5th leap month), the Hongwu Emperor died. On 30 June (16th day of the 5th leap month), Imperial Grandson-heir Zhu Yunwen ascended the throne as the Jianwen Emperor. The following year, the era was changed to Jianwen.

On 18 July 1402 (Jianwen 4, 18th day of the 6th month), the Yongle Emperor, who had usurped the throne through the Jingnan campaign, abolished the Jianwen era name and renamed it Hongwu 35. The following year, the era was changed to Yongle. According to Xia Xie (夏燮)&#x27;s &quot;Ming Tongjian&quot; (明通鑑), since Zhu Di had started his rebellion at Beijing in 1399 (Jianwen 1), he had begun restoring the Hongwu era name in his conquered areas, and after the Jingnan campaign, he had ordered the whole country to reuse the Hongwu era name.

<doc id="207630" wikidata="Q1187824" url="?curid=207630" title="Dominion War">
<text>The Dominion War is an extended plot concept developed in several story arcs of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, an American science-fiction television series produced by Paramount Pictures. In the fictional &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, the Dominion War is a conflict between the forces of the Dominion, the Cardassian Union, and, eventually, the Breen Confederacy against the Alpha Quadrant alliance of the United Federation of Planets, the Klingon Empire and, later, the Romulan Star Empire. The war takes place in the final two seasons of the series, but has been gradually built up to over the course of the five preceding seasons.

The principal setting of the series is the Starfleet-controlled space station Deep Space Nine, located adjacent to the mouth of a stable wormhole near the planet Bajor. The Bajoran wormhole provides instantaneous travel to the Gamma Quadrant, a region on the other side of the galaxy. During the second season of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, the Dominion, a powerful empire in the Gamma Quadrant, is introduced; and over the course of the second and third seasons, more information about the Dominion is revealed. Conflict escalates through the fourth and fifth seasons, as the Dominion infiltrates Alpha Quadrant powers and eventually forms an alliance with Cardassia; open warfare begins at the end of the fifth season, when the Dominion briefly occupies Deep Space Nine, and continues until the Dominion is finally defeated in the series finale.

The Dominion War arcs present themes that challenge the values of the characters in a manner not attempted in earlier series of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Developing the plot of the Dominion War also altered how the series was scripted, shifting the emphasis from an episodic to a serialized narrative format.

==Dominion==

The Dominion is an interstellar state and military superpower from the Gamma Quadrant, composed of hundreds of dominated alien species. The Dominion is commanded by The Founders, a race of shapeshifters (or Changelings as they are often referred to), responsible for both the creation of the Dominion and all strategic decisions undertaken through its history. The Dominion is administered by the Vorta, clones specifically genetically engineered by the Founders to act as field commanders, administrators, scientists and diplomats. The Jem&#x27;Hadar, also engineered by the Founders, are the military arm of the Dominion and one of the most powerful military forces in the galaxy during the Dominion&#x27;s height.

===Member races===
The Dominion incorporated a vast number of planets, and their resident species, into its military and civilian ranks, including:
* Changelings/Founders (the rulers of the Dominion)
* Vorta (administrative/diplomatic/scientist class of clones; genetically engineered by the Founders)
* Jem&#x27;Hadar (shock troops under the direct command of the Vorta; genetically engineered by the Founders)
* Son&#x27;a
* Hunters
* Tosk
* Skreea
* Karemma
* Dosi
* Breen
* Cardassians
* T-Rogorans

Little is revealed regarding the Dominion&#x27;s inner workings, other than the fact that the Jem&#x27;Hadar and Vorta fulfill the main military and administrative roles respectively.

===Early history===
The Dominion was established between two thousand and ten thousand years before the events of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, by the Changelings, a race of liquid lifeforms capable of shapeshifting, as a means of defending themselves against the widespread persecution they faced from humanoid races (whom they called &quot;solids&quot;). These Changelings genetically engineered a series of slave races to act as the foot soldiers of their new empire, and were dubbed the Founders by their new creations. Over 200 years before first contact with Deep Space Nine, the Changelings&#x27; Great Link (a planet in the Gamma Quadrant where Changelings exist in their natural &quot;gelatinous&quot; form) had sent out 100 Changeling infants in containers through the universe in order to see how other (alien) races react to the presence of Changelings. Of those sent out, three have been accounted for:
* Odo. Sent into space as an infant, Odo ultimately arrived in the Alpha Quadrant in the region of the planet Bajor, which was under Cardassian occupation at the time. After being studied by a Bajoran scientist, he learns to take humanoid form and eventually becomes Security Chief at Deep Space Nine, a role he maintained once the Federation controlled the station. In a battle with a Changeling spy, Odo ended up killing it, thus breaking the most important rule of his people, that no Changeling may ever hurt another (&quot;The Adversary&quot;). He was punished by the Great Link who took away his shapeshifting abilities and forced to remain a solid in his humanoid form (&quot;Broken Link&quot;). Some months later, he regained his powers after trying to save a dying infant Changeling. Although his deepest desire is to rejoin the Great Link, he is reluctant to do so due to the Founders&#x27; crusade of total war against every solid in the Alpha Quadrant. In the last episode of the series, Odo does rejoin the Great Link which saves them from being totally destroyed by a genetically engineered virus. (&quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;)
* Unnamed Infant Changeling. Obtained by Odo from Quark, Odo tries to teach the infant how to shapeshift. However the infant is dying from radiation poisoning. As its last act, it joins with Odo which restores his ability to shapeshift. (&quot;The Begotten&quot;)
* Laas. Over 200 years old, he ended up on the Valara planet whose name &quot;Laas&quot; means &quot;Changeable&quot;; he left when he realized that he was only being tolerated and would never be accepted. He ended up on Deep Space Nine, where he showed his shapeshifting skills were far more advanced than Odo&#x27;s (even changing into a mist at one point). In self-defense, he killed a Klingon warrior who was going to assault him; and with the help of Major Kira, he escaped. He vowed to search the Alpha Quadrant in order to find the other missing Hundred Changelings like himself and Odo in order to create a new Great Link. (&quot;Chimera&quot;)

===First contact and escalation===
The Dominion was unknown to the Alpha Quadrant powers until the discovery of the Bajoran wormhole in 2369, which facilitated exploration of the Gamma Quadrant. In 2370, Jem&#x27;Hadar troops annihilated numerous Bajoran and Federation colonies and ships in the Gamma Quadrant and captured Commander Benjamin Sisko, as the Dominion demanded the Federation stay on their side of the &quot;anomaly&quot;. A Federation starship, the USS &quot;Odyssey&quot;, was destroyed by a kamikaze attack after the Federation rescued Sisko, as the Dominion demonstrated not only an ability to penetrate shielding, but a fanatical devotion to their cause as the suicide attack was made on a retreating ship, solely to drive the point home to the Federation. As a result of this incident, the Federation pulled the USS &quot;Defiant&quot; out of storage (which was originally designed to combat the Borg), complete with a Romulan cloaking device, and began preparations for a drastic increase in Deep Space Nine&#x27;s defensive capabilities.

A Federation mission the next year to find and make peace with the Founders ended disastrously, when the peace expedition was captured and subjected to hallucinogenic manipulation to test the willingness of the Federation to appease the Dominion. As a result of this incident, it was discovered that the reclusive Founders of the organization (previously unseen) were the Changelings. The Changelings justified their actions by the need to protect their species against persecution by &quot;solids&quot;, and also spoke of a duty and inclination to &quot;impose order on a chaotic universe&quot;.

As a result of the continued Dominion threat, numerous Alpha Quadrant powers acted with increased preparations and paranoia, one expression of which was the Romulan attempt to forcibly collapse the wormhole. Despite the Dominion&#x27;s warnings, the Federation continued to chart the Gamma Quadrant. Founders began infiltrating the Alpha Quadrant, even wreaking havoc on Earth itself. In 2371, the combined intelligence organizations of the Cardassian Union and Romulan Star Empire attempted a strike into the Gamma Quadrant with a cloaked fleet, seeking to destroy the Founders&#x27; homeworld and cripple the Dominion. Due to intensive Changeling manipulation, this attack force was ambushed while assaulting an abandoned planet that was believed to be the supposed Founder homeworld, and was completely crushed. It is later revealed that the main advocate of attacking the Dominion was a Changeling infiltrator. This failure weakened the Cardassians and Romulans and paved the way for Dominion intrusion into the Alpha Quadrant. A Changeling impersonating Federation Ambassador Krajensky informed newly promoted Captain Sisko that there was a coup on Tzenketh. The Changeling later sabotaged the &quot;Defiant&quot; and reprogrammed it to target the Tzenkethi in the hopes that the attack would trigger a war, allowing the Dominion to conquer the Alpha Quadrant. The Federation stopped the Changeling and retook control of the &quot;Defiant&quot;.

The quadrant was plunged into conflict when the Klingon Empire accused the Cardassian Union of being under the control of the Founders. When the Federation condemned the Klingon attack on Cardassia, Gowron banished Federation citizens from Klingon space, recalled their ambassadors and withdrew from the Khitomer Accords. The Federation and Cardassians fought months of armed combat against the Klingons. It was later revealed by Benjamin Sisko, Worf, Miles O&#x27;Brien and Odo that it was the Klingons themselves who unknowingly had a Changeling in their midst, pretending to be General Martok. Gowron rejoined the Khitomer Accords and joined to fight the Dominion.

==Synopsis==

In &quot;Emissary&quot;, the pilot episode, the United Federation of Planets dispatches Commander Benjamin Sisko to take command of the space station Deep Space Nine. During the episode, it is discovered that the station is located near a stable wormhole connecting the Alpha Quadrant to the Gamma Quadrant of the Milky Way Galaxy, nearly 70,000 light years away. Deep Space Nine is moved from the orbit of the planet Bajor to the Alpha Quadrant terminus of the wormhole to lay claim. Starships begin to enter the wormhole to explore, colonize and trade. The crews on the ships are unaware that they are entering a region of space controlled by the Dominion, a union of planets ordered by force and intimidation.

During the second season, Quark, a Ferengi bartender sent by his government to begin trade negotiations in the Gamma Quadrant, makes contact with the Karemma, a Dominion member race. Some time later, he and Sisko are captured by the Jem&#x27;Hadar, the soldiers of the Dominion. They are rescued, but Jem&#x27;Hadar destroy the Federation ship USS &quot;Odyssey&quot; and Bajoran colonies in the Gamma Quadrant as a warning not to re-enter Dominion space. Soon, it is revealed that a race of shapeshifters, known as &quot;Changelings&quot; or &quot;the Founders&quot;, are the rulers of the Dominion. The Cardassian and Romulan intelligence agencies, the Obsidian Order and the Tal Shiar, attempt to eradicate the Founders to protect the Alpha Quadrant, but their plans are compromised by Changeling infiltration, and their fleet is ambushed and destroyed.

The Founders initiate a campaign of sabotage and terror against the Alpha Quadrant, which leaves many governments fearful of Changeling infiltrators, who are able to assume any physical form. When Earth is attacked, a band of Starfleet officers illegally attempt to impose martial law at the heart of the Federation. The Klingon Empire invades Cardassia on the incorrect suspicion that the Dominion is influencing its government; this idea turns out to have been planted by a Changeling infiltrator posing as Martok, an influential Klingon general. The invasion of Cardassia leads to a dissolution of the Federation&#x27;s alliance with the Klingons. The Founders plant false intelligence that it is the Klingon Chancellor, Gowron, who is a Changeling, intended to induce the Federation to assassinate Gowron and further intensify the rift between the Federation and Klingons. The Founders&#x27; plan fails when the assassination team, led by Sisko, realize that Martok, not Gowron, was the actual shapeshifter.

The disgraced Cardassian officer Dukat forges an alliance between Cardassia and the Dominion, establishing a Dominion foothold in the Alpha Quadrant, in exchange for being made ruler of Cardassia. Realizing the danger, the Federation and Klingons join forces to slow the Dominion build-up, cooperating to plant a minefield across the entrance to the wormhole to prevent further invasion. Nevertheless, the Dominion begins to advance, and seizes control of Deep Space Nine. After a brief retreat, Sisko executes a successful return to the space station, but the wider conflict continues. More setbacks hinder the Alpha Quadrant alliance as additional races, such as the Breen, offer their support to the Dominion. Questionable tactics are adopted in the search for victory: Sisko uses manufactured intelligence and a murdered senator to convince the Romulans to ally with the Federation; and the Federation&#x27;s covert-operations agency, Section 31, disseminates an engineered virus among the Founders. Dukat&#x27;s successor as Cardassian leader, Damar, launches a successful resistance movement against the Dominion; in response, the Dominion attempts genocide against the entire Cardassian race. Eventually, the Dominion is forced back to the planet Cardassia Prime where it is cut off from reinforcements. The Changeling in command informs Odo, a renegade Changeling on the side of the Federation, that they will fight to the end to prevent any counter-attack by the alliance into the Gamma Quadrant. Odo assures her that the Federation would not do that while the other parties would be too weak to. Odo cures her of the disease afflicting her and the other Founders with the antidote he received, and the Dominion agrees to surrender.

==Conception==

In 2002, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; producer Ira Steven Behr stated that unlike some plots, which originated from a single small idea, the creation of the Dominion villain and story arc was &quot;very much thought out.&quot; Behr said that the earliest mention of the Dominion was purposely planted in the comic Season Two Ferengi episode, &quot;Rules of Acquisition&quot;, to leave the audience with an impression of &quot;how important could it be?&quot; It was decided that the Gamma Quadrant would need an ambience that would distinguish it from the Alpha Quadrant. The Dominion were mentioned for a second time in the later second-season episode “Sanctuary” but this time giving a hint that they were an aggressive power. The producers wanted to portray the region as something other than &quot;uncharted space&quot;, and avoid imitating the adventures of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; with another series of plots focusing primarily on themes of exploration. After 18 months of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; exposition, the producers decided to characterize The Dominion as &quot;anti-Federation&quot;. Writer and script editor Robert Hewitt Wolfe has explained that this move also distinguished &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; from its successor series, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, which stars a lost Federation ship traversing the chaotic and divided Delta Quadrant of the Milky Way.

Instead of introducing one alien race, three were introduced simultaneously: the Changelings, the Vorta and the Jem&#x27;Hadar. These three were intended to represent the front of an ancient civilization held together by fear, to contrast with the unity of the Federation enabled by bonds of friendship. Behr, Wolfe, writer Peter Allan Fields and Jim Crocker attended meetings to develop the concepts of these species and found general inspiration in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; Trilogy novels. Toward the end of Season Two production executive producer Michael Piller suggested the idea that the Founders of the Dominion be the race to which Odo belongs, and discovered that Behr and Wolfe had also discussed this possibility. This character had been introduced with no knowledge of his true origins. Piller asserts that the endeavor to create a new villain was one of the most difficult tasks he undertook in his work on &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Wolfe perceives similarities between the fictional Founders and the Roman Empire, in that the species first uses diplomacy, deception and cultural imperialism to achieve their aims before ultimately resorting to coercion. Wolfe also characterized the Dominion as a &quot;carrot and stick&quot; empire, with the Vorta offering the carrot and the Jem&#x27;Hadar holding the stick.

According to writer Ronald D. Moore, co-creator Rick Berman originally intended the Dominion War to be the focus of three or four episodes, but Behr intended to expand the plotline all along. Moore has stated that Berman sometimes questioned the writing staff about the degree of violence included in some episodes. Berman also expressed concern about the portrayal of long-term consequences for the main characters, such as the loss of a character&#x27;s leg in Season Seven. The writers argued in favor of the increased violence, asserting that it was justified in view of the plotlines detailing the progression of the Dominion War. Piller supported the idea that the repercussions of past episodes should continue to be felt, and that characters should &quot;learn that actions have consequences&quot;, even if such consequences were to lead off in directions Piller had not originally imagined when &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; remained in the conceptual stages. Moore has stated that the filming of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; occupied more of Berman and Piller&#x27;s time from &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; third season, which allowed Behr to defend his creative decisions more successfully. Following the completion of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, the writing staff could dedicate more time to working on scripts for &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. The writers admired the scripting techniques used for &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;: Moore cites the episode &quot;Errand of Mercy&quot; (1967) as a strong influence on his treatment of the Dominion War.

==Development==
The plot of the Dominion War is presented in a succession of shorter story arcs which span Seasons Two through Seven of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and are linked editorially by the decisions of the producers and writers.

===Season Two: Introducing the Dominion===
After conceptual meetings, the writers began to introduce allusions to the Dominion into episodes of Season Two. The intention was to gradually increase the audience&#x27;s awareness that there was a large and pervasive polity at work behind apparently innocuous events in the Gamma Quadrant. The Dominion and its methods are revealed across three episodes of the season.

&quot;Rules of Acquisition&quot; marks the first mention of the Dominion, when the Ferengi character Quark hears whispers of a powerful union of civilizations in the Gamma Quadrant with which he may be able to trade. Dialogue that seems inconsequential within the framework of a light-hearted episode was planned to ultimately create major change in the dynamics of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;.

As Alpha Quadrant races begin to colonize planets in the Gamma Quadrant and their presence becomes known, disturbing reports indicate that what the Dominion cannot attain through trade is forcibly seized. These reports are justified in &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, when a large fleet of Skrreea ships appears in the Alpha Quadrant, in search of a new homeworld in light of the conquest of their original planet by Dominion forces. The actions of the Dominion are contrasted with the reactions of the regular characters to the Skrreea refugees. Executive producer Michael Piller has suggested that the plot evoked real-world debate surrounding Proposition 187, a Californian law concerning the rights of illegal aliens.

The finale of Season Two, &quot;The Jem&#x27;Hadar&quot;, permitted writer Robert Hewitt Wolfe to surprise the audience and challenge their opinions concerning the safety of the Federation and Starfleet, when the USS &quot;Odyssey&quot;, a &quot;Galaxy&quot;-class starship similar to the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; from &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, is outfought and destroyed. The Dominion is revealed to be a ruthless empire, using &quot;carrot and stick&quot; methods to control others, with three distinct races performing crucial roles. The Dominion&#x27;s Jem&#x27;Hadar shock troops capture Commander Sisko, Quark, and an alien named Eris, who is later identified as a double agent and one of the Vorta, the Dominion&#x27;s negotiators and administrators. The Jem&#x27;Hadar send a representative to &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; with the message that no further intrusions into Dominion space will be tolerated and to hand Major Kira Nerys a list of colonies and ships already eliminated for trespassing. The Federation dispatches a rescue team that returns Sisko&#x27;s group to the station, but, while retreating back to the Alpha Quadrant, a Jem&#x27;Hadar ship launches a kamikaze run against the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, resulting in the destruction of both ships.

===Season Three: Introducing the Founders===
With the third season, Ronald D. Moore and others started to write regularly for &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; following the completion of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Robert Hewitt Wolfe joined Ira Steven Behr in scripting episodes developing the Dominion plotline, beginning with &quot;The Search&quot;. Behr became full executive producer at the midpoint of the season, after the departure of Michael Piller.

In the two-part season opener, &quot;The Search&quot;, Commander Sisko returns from Starfleet Headquarters on Earth with a &quot;Defiant&quot;-class prototype starship, the USS &quot;Defiant&quot;. Executive producer Rick Berman had to be convinced that the introduction of the &quot;Defiant&quot; would not distract the audience from the main starship of the latest &quot;Star Trek&quot; production, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. The decision was made on the basis that a ship was needed to provide an avenue for stories set off the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; space station and that such a vessel would need the potential to oppose the Jem&#x27;Hadar, who had already been portrayed obliterating large ships. Audience research had also suggested that young male viewers were hoping for more action-oriented episodes with greater jeopardy.

Season Three&#x27;s Dominion stories explore the connection between Odo and his people, and their conflicting attitudes toward &quot;solid&quot; sentient lifeforms. The &quot;Defiant&quot; enters the Gamma Quadrant on a peace mission to locate the Founders in &quot;The Search&quot;, and it is discovered that the Founders are of the same race as Odo. Despite a burning desire to return to his home, he finds his people&#x27;s philosophy – that which you can control cannot hurt you – abhorrent, and he asks to return to the Alpha Quadrant. The Founders, led by a character identified only as the &quot;Female Changeling&quot;, acquiesce to Odo&#x27;s request in the hope that he will ultimately rejoin them.

Another facet to the Dominion was evaluated more closely in Season Three – the Jem&#x27;Hadar. In &quot;The Abandoned&quot;, a juvenile Jem&#x27;Hadar is found alone and matures under Odo&#x27;s guidance. The crew of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; witnesses the Jem&#x27;Hadar&#x27;s difficulty in adjusting to a society with rules different from those of his native culture. Avery Brooks, directing this episode, has emphasized the story as a metaphor for African-American adolescents in the 20th century and their struggles with addiction and violence, their integration into American society, and how their upbringing might contribute to these problems. Brooks ensured that Odo continued to support the maturing Jem&#x27;Hadar despite the alien&#x27;s regression to Dominion custom, as a commentary on how modern society should engage with young people.

&quot;Improbable Cause&quot; initiates a two-part adventure concerning the search for the Founders&#x27; homeworld, which concludes in &quot;The Die is Cast&quot;. Following first contact with the Founders, the Obsidian Order – a covert Cardassian intelligence force – ally themselves with the Tal Shiar, their Romulan counterpart, and launch a secret, pre-emptive strike to destroy the Founders&#x27; homeworld, hoping that the Founders and the rest of the Dominion will collapse. The Dominion successfully lures the fleets of the Tal Shiar and the Obsidian Order into a trap, eliminating both organizations. The plot establishes an atmosphere of suspicion amongst the Alpha Quadrant powers, initiated by the shapeshifters&#x27; abilities to assume other identities, which forms the basis of plots for Season Four.

The Season Three finale turned out to differ significantly from the production staff&#x27;s conceptual vision. Paramount did not favor the idea of a season-end cliffhanger which would have revealed the presence of shapeshifters on Earth. To continue the theme of paranoia about shapeshifters and the Dominion, &quot;The Adversary&quot; was instead scripted to set up a hunt for a Founder aboard the &quot;Defiant&quot;, incorporating some narrative elements at first intended to commence Season Four, while offering a more self-contained plot and using existing sets to reduce production costs.

===Season Four: Founder infiltration and political destabilization===
Rick Berman, Robert Hewitt Wolfe, and Ira Steven Behr originally expected to open Season Four with a two-part episode, postponed from the end of Season Three, that ultimately became &quot;Homefront&quot; and &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Paramount determined that the writers needed to come up with a much different opener to satisfy the audience but without giving specific instructions. The production staff decided to begin a plotline based around suspicions between the Federation and the Klingons, finally leading to conflict between the former allies, which was inspired by a line from the Season Three episode &quot;The Die is Cast&quot;. With the Klingons set to reappear, Berman suggested the return of a character from &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; – the Klingon Worf – as a permanent officer aboard Deep Space Nine. While both the new plot and character offered interesting possibilities, the producers felt that their vision for &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; was put off-course for almost one year.

Season Four begins with &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot;, which marks the arrival of Worf. This episode is one of a few in this season to explore themes of suspicion and paranoia and their effect upon societies and relationships, building up to &quot;Homefront&quot; and &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. After the events of &quot;The Die is Cast&quot;, fear about the identities of the infiltrator changelings leads the Klingons to suspect Dominion involvement in the new Cardassian civilian government. Their refusal to break off an invasion, even after Dominion involvement has been disproved, results in a military confrontation and diplomatic breakdown, and the Klingons attempt to seize Deep Space Nine. This seems to further the Founders&#x27; goal of the destabilization of the Alpha Quadrant as a prelude to their own invasion.

In &quot;Hippocratic Oath&quot;, the characters of Dr. Bashir and Chief O&#x27;Brien debate curing a group of Jem&#x27;Hadar soldiers of an addiction in the hope that they will rebel against the Dominion. There is discussion about the identity of the true enemy, the limits of duty, and whether soldiers are responsible for the actions of their leaders. &quot;To the Death&quot; further investigates the themes of soldier duty and loyalty, and it contrasts the opposing rules of discipline that regulate Starfleet officers and Jem&#x27;Hadar troops. In addition, this episode introduced the Vorta representative Weyoun, who would become the most prominent Vorta in the rest of the series.

In &quot;Homefront&quot;, the mistrust generated by the shapeshifters continues, with Captain Sisko suspecting his own father and recommending a state of emergency be declared on Earth. In &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, some Starfleet officers go further and attempt to implement a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against the President of the Federation after it is revealed that shapeshifters have infiltrated Earth and committed a terrorist attack. This leads to an armed conflict between Starfleet vessels for the first time in a century, according to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; in-universe timeline. Sisko is able to force Admiral Leyton to abandon his efforts to impose martial law by telling him: &quot;You&#x27;re fighting the wrong war!&quot; Behr&#x27;s favorite line from the episode is &quot;Paradise never seemed so well-armed&quot;, highlighting one of many occasions when &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; would point out the practical issues revolving around maintaining the peaceful culture of the Federation and the moral or immoral choices made to achieve this ideal.

===Season Five: build-up to all-out war===
In the fifth season, the Dominion invasion of the Alpha Quadrant gathers pace, appearing in episodes such as &quot;Apocalypse Rising&quot;, &quot;In Purgatory&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, &quot;By Inferno&#x27;s Light&quot;, and &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;. Robert Hewitt Wolfe and Ira Steven Behr were again responsible for the major Season Five episodes concerning the Dominion.

In the Season Five opener, &quot;Apocalypse Rising&quot;, Odo discovers that his race is capable of deceiving their own kind, as well as &quot;solids&quot;, when he is led to believe that Klingon Chancellor Gowron is a Changeling instead of the General, Martok. This plot was planned to shift the focus of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episodes back toward the struggle with the Dominion, which had been postponed in earlier production discussions with Paramount in favor of bringing Worf and a Klingon-based plotline into the series.

In &quot;In Purgatory&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, it is discovered that Dr. Bashir has been kidnapped, imprisoned for weeks, and, in the interim, replaced by a Changeling. The shapeshifter double sabotages efforts to close the Wormhole and attempts to destroy the Bajoran sun, leaving the path open for Dominion fleets to enter the Alpha Quadrant. In the following episode, &quot;By Inferno&#x27;s Light&quot;, the Cardassians become a member of the Dominion, and the Federation and Klingon Empire resolve to cast aside their mutual distrust and unite against the common threat. A garrison of Klingon troops is stationed on Deep Space Nine, under the command of the real General Martok, rescued from Dominion incarceration with Bashir. In &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;, the characters confront the issue of ethnic cleansing when the Maquis – a resistance group of former Federation citizens now living in Cardassian space – are hunted down and ask for the assistance of Sisko, who used to criticize their methods.

The Season Five finale, &quot;Call to Arms&quot;, sets the scene for the commencement of full-scale war between the Dominion and the Federation during the final two seasons of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. When the Dominion begins to send ships through the Wormhole, the Alpha Quadrant allies build a minefield at its mouth to cut off the supply line. The plot considers whether it is better for the planet Bajor to stand with their Federation friends or remain neutral in the coming war to protect themselves. Sisko persuades them that neutrality is the favorable course.

===Season Six: the war rages===
Season Six, charting the turmoil of the Dominion War, faces themes of the moral dilemmas of conflict. New plot elements permitted &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; to examine themes in a manner unlike preceding &quot;Star Trek&quot; productions, as characters are forced to re-evaluate their beliefs. The production staff resolved to start the season with a six-episode arc, the first attempted in the history of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

Rick Berman originally pictured that the Dominion War would last for a limited number of episodes before a prompt resolution. Planning the arc, Ira Steven Behr, Ronald D. Moore, and the writers conceived a longer chain of first five, then six connected episodes, stretching from &quot;A Time to Stand&quot; to &quot;Sacrifice of Angels&quot;, as themes increased demands for greater narrative development. No writer had previously contributed to a series involving arcs of such length, and Moore, Behr, and novice scripting partner &amp; supervising producer Hans Beimler have all stated that the writing process changed as a result, with more production collaboration and interaction than for earlier seasons of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. The potential for serialization that Rick Berman had perceived from the start of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; came to fruition as a result of the multiple plotlines accumulating to form the Dominion War.

The return of Gul Dukat as commander of the Dominion-controlled Deep Space Nine enabled the writers to contrast the space station of the audience&#x27;s imagination to its incarnation as a former Cardassian mining facility. Former resistance fighter Major Kira is portrayed re-considering her ethical code as she sets out on the path to collaboration in &quot;Rocks and Shoals&quot;, but the suicide of a Bajoran monk reminds her of the reality of her situation. Through &quot;Rocks and Shoals&quot;, &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; also revisits themes of war conduct as Sisko considers the morality of ambushing soldiers whom superiors have forsaken, only for events to force his hand. In &quot;A Time to Stand&quot; and &quot;Behind the Lines&quot;, the character of Odo is torn between the trust placed in him by Kira and the Bajorans, and his status as a Founder, when he joins Deep Space Nine&#x27;s Dominion council and then neglects to help his comrades at a critical moment.

Fortune is reversed again in Season Six as Starfleet re-captures Deep Space Nine in the closing episodes of the opening arc, &quot;Favor the Bold&quot; and &quot;Sacrifice of Angels&quot;. The USS &quot;Defiant&quot; stands alone in an attempt to hold back thousands of Dominion ships entering through the Wormhole. An intervention from the Wormhole Prophets, considered gods by the Bajorans, leads characters to ponder questions of faith and destiny. Writer Hans Beimler wished to include mythological allusions, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s tragic hero stuff. A hero [Sisko] takes on things for others, but doesn&#x27;t necessarily find any peace himself in the result.&quot; Ira Steven Behr compares Sisko to the Biblical figure Moses, who fails to reach the Promised Land, and to the character of Ethan Edwards from the Western film &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956), who neglects to return to his family once his task is complete. It was determined that this facet to Sisko&#x27;s character justified the use of divine intervention to resolve the Dominion threat: the fleet disappears and the Federation regains control of Deep Space Nine. The defeat costs Dukat his mental health, the life of his daughter, Tora Ziyal, and his status as Cardassian leader. Dukat is the first, but not the only, character in Season Six to face the pain of loss in conflict. Later, in the season six finale &quot;Tears of the Prophets&quot;, Worf loses his wife Jadzia Dax when she is killed by Dukat.

Although themes of death are apparent in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; previous seasons, &quot;Far Beyond the Stars&quot; details how Sisko copes with the loss of a friend on a deeper psychological level. Experiencing visions of himself confronting racial discrimination against Black Americans in the 1950s, Sisko interprets useful parallels connected to his life on Deep Space Nine. Sisko&#x27;s response to the death toll of the Dominion War is re-examined in &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot;.

Additionally, Season Six introduces Section 31, a secret organization dedicated to preserving the Federation&#x27;s principles regardless of the cost and legitimacy of its methods. In &quot;Inquisition&quot;, the character of Dr. Bashir refuses to join Section 31 and reports its actions, but still ponders its significance: &quot;But what would that say about us? That we&#x27;re no different than our enemies? That when push comes to shove, we&#x27;re willing to throw away our principles in order to survive?&quot; Sisko replies, &quot;I wish I had an answer for you.&quot;

&quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; considers a similar moral dilemma when the Dominion captures an important Federation planet, Betazed, in a surprise attack. The subjugation of a planet familiar to the audience was used to heighten the sense of danger and the stakes for the characters. In this episode, Sisko fuels a conspiracy intended to improve the war situation that ultimately results in the character of Elim Garak committing murder. In the context of the Dominion War, it is resolved to conceal the truth for the greater good. Writer Michael Taylor has suggested, &quot;It showed how &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; could really stretch the &quot;Star Trek&quot; formula. It pushes the boundaries in a realistic way, because the decisions Sisko makes are the kinds of decisions that have to be made in war. They&#x27;re for the greater good.&quot;

===Season Seven: end of the war===
Season Seven charts further dilemmas of conflict. Following the example of Season Six, the writers considered using an arc to conclude the multiple Dominion War threads in satisfying fashion, deciding that &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; could not be concluded in one or two episodes alone. A ten-episode arc was outlined to end Season Seven, the Dominion War, and all of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, and more alterations were made as scripting progressed.

Characters face issues of genocide: in &quot;Treachery, Faith, and the Great River&quot;, Constable Odo learns of the engineered virus that Section 31 has disseminated among the Founders, and in &quot;When It Rains...&quot; that Section 31 has infected him to communicate the disease. While Dr. Bashir supports providing the Founders with a cure, others are unconvinced.

In “Penumbra”, it is revealed that the Dominion is receiving logistical support from the Son&#x27;a, who begin production of the Ketracel-white needed for the Jem&#x27;Hadar. Another opponent reveals itself when the Breen Confederacy signs a pact with the Dominion in &quot;&#x27;Til Death Do Us Part&quot;. For &quot;The Changing Face of Evil&quot;, writers Ira Steven Behr and Hans Beimler scripted a second strike against the Federation through a Breen assault on Earth. Later, with the addition of their new Breen allies, the Dominion retake the Chin&#x27;toka system, which sees the destruction of a number of Klingon, Romulan and Federation ships including the USS &quot;Defiant&quot;. Ronald D. Moore has stated: &quot;We wanted to kill the &quot;Defiant&quot; as a statement on how tough the Breen were. We thought that would rock the characters and the audience.&quot; Behr explains that, &quot;... the ship had become a character that had caught on in people&#x27;s hearts and minds ... when the &quot;Defiant&quot; went down, that hurt.&quot;

The resurgence in the conflict provided opportunities to introduce problems such as post-conflict psychological trauma in &quot;The Siege of AR-558&quot; and injury when the character of Nog undergoes leg amputation in &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Paper Moon&quot;. Moore has said that the plot of this episode was agreed on after an &quot;extended argument&quot; between Behr and &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; creator Rick Berman and that such discussions were a common occurrence when war casualties were considered. Michele and Duncan Barrett perceive the allusions made to the traumas of World War I.

The concept of resistance is re-opened in the context of Cardassia rather than Bajor. Legate Damar becomes more and more frustrated with the deadlocked conflict and his situation as a Dominion puppet. As Cardassian military losses mount and Dominion control of Cardassia deepens, he becomes alcoholic and criticizes the Dominion&#x27;s power. Damar was originally to be revealed as a double agent for the Federation, but Moore then suggested the slave revolt of Spartacus as a model. Damar establishes an underground resistance movement, is branded a rebel, and goes into hiding. Kira, Garak, and Odo are sent as &quot;technical advisors&quot; to help him in &quot;When It Rains...&quot;.

The relationship between Cardassians and Bajorans, former enemies turned allies, is charted in &quot;Tacking Into the Wind&quot;, in which Damar and Kira&#x27;s group abandon prejudice and collaborate to seize a Breen weapon. Continuing into &quot;The Dogs of War&quot;, Damar is forced to choose between his Cardassian comrades, stubborn in their beliefs, and the support of Kira and others whom he used to consider enemies. As the tide turns against the Dominion, cut off from the Gamma Quadrant and without technological advantage, a last stand is prepared. The Female Changeling orders the destruction of a metropolis, Lakarian City, to coerce the Cardassians back into line, but, instead, the Cardassian fleet defects, passing the advantage to the Alpha Quadrant alliance. Consequently, an attempted extermination results in the deaths of 800 million Cardassians in a Dominion bombardment.

Allusions to genocide contrast with ethical discussion concerning the engineered &quot;Founders disease&quot; and a potential cure. In &quot;Extreme Measures&quot;, the characters of Dr. Bashir and Chief O&#x27;Brien locate a treatment inside the mind of Section 31 agent Luther Sloan. A moral debate ensues on what constitutes genocide. While Bashir supports offering a cure to the Founders, Sisko determines that the disease should be left to continue crippling the powerful opposition. However, in &quot;The Dogs of War&quot;, Odo declares that this amounts to genocide of his species and is handed a treatment by Bashir. In return for the Dominion&#x27;s peaceful surrender, and the arrest of the Female Changeling on charges of war crimes, the Alpha Quadrant alliance permits Odo to heal the rest of his people.

The Treaty of Bajor is signed aboard Deep Space Nine in the Season Seven finale, &quot;What You Leave Behind, Part II&quot;. The conclusion to the Dominion War arc formed the resolution to &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; as a series, and a moment for the production staff to settle the destinies of the main characters. Berman and Behr agreed with Paramount that the final episode of the series should concentrate on human drama rather than the endgame of the Dominion War. Moore opines the production staff succeeded in ensuring the Dominion War acted as a means of deepening characterization. Although further plots would have been scripted had &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; continued into an eighth season, Behr accepted the resolution of the Dominion War at the end of Season Seven.

===After the War===
The state of the Dominion as a political entity at the conclusion of the war has never been fully discussed in &quot;Star Trek&quot; canon. The terms of the final treaty ending the war were never shown. At the conclusion of the war, it is assumed that the Dominion still held vast territories in the Gamma Quadrant. Odo&#x27;s return to the Great Link is partially intended to share with the other changelings the information he has about how the war concluded and what he knows from living with solids; presumably, this is to change the goals and tactics of the Founders to a system that coexists with the solids as opposed to a strategy of domination.

However, through Odo&#x27;s sharing of intelligence with him, Worf reveals in the &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; episode &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; that the Founders were split on the question of whether to cooperate with the Federation in upholding the treaty, or take up revenge. The renegade faction wanting revenge is revealed to have stolen key technologies from the Federation&#x27;s Daystrom Institute. This information is kept quiet in the fears of the Dominion War being restarted. The leader of the faction, Vadic, later tells Jean-Luc Picard that she had been a prisoner of war during the Dominion War and experimented upon by Federation scientists, resulting in Vadic and her followers gaining enhanced abilities. This, combined with the devastation her people had faced during the war from the Section 31 virus, had led Vadic to ally herself with the Borg for revenge. Vadic and most of her forces are killed during a failed attempt to hijack the USS &quot;Titan&quot;-A. Following the defeat of the Borg, Beverly Crusher is able to figure out a way to detect the remaining Founder infiltrators throughout Starfleet, leading to their exposure and arrest. Starfleet also discovers that many of the officers that the Founders had replaced, including Captain Tuvok, are still alive and rescue them.

In the non-canon relaunch novels published by Pocket Books, it is revealed that the Dominion and Breen forces withdraw from Cardassian space. Through Odo&#x27;s efforts, the Dominion permits visitors from the Alpha Quadrant to resume peaceful operations in the Gamma Quadrant in exchange for leaving its territory alone. Odo then begins attempting to change the nature of the Dominion by convincing the Founders to re-evaluate their views on other species, as well as encouraging certain Vorta and Jem&#x27;Hadar to behave more independently. The allied powers begin coordinating relief efforts to Cardassia, using Bajor as a staging point. The Cardassian Union is divided into separate protectorates to be occupied by the allies while the Cardassians recover. For her part in orchestrating the war, the Female Founder is sentenced to life imprisonment at Ananke Alpha, a maximum security Federation prison.

==Reception==

===Former cast members and production staff===
In a 2007 interview with &quot;iF&quot; magazine, George Takei, who played Hikaru Sulu in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; and its films, described &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; as representing the &quot;polar opposite&quot; of Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s vision and philosophy of the future. Writer D. C. Fontana has stated in an interview that Roddenberry would have admired the later series for its dark themes, referring to Roddenberry&#x27;s military service record in World War II.

Roddenberry doubted that a series concentrating on themes aside from space exploration could endure, and voiced displeasure with initial concepts for &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; presented to him in 1991. Rick Berman has explained that Roddenberry, although terminally ill, had given him his blessing for its development, but that he had no opportunity to discuss any of the ideas with Roddenberry.

===Critical reception===
John J. O&#x27;Connor, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in January 1993, noted that pre-release advertisements for &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; offered &quot;a new &quot;Star Trek&quot; era&quot; and added, &quot;Welcome to the Dark Side. The determinedly optimistic Mr. Roddenberry was partial to plots that made uplifting moral points. The new creators and executive producers, Rick Berman and Michael Piller, are shooting, so to speak, for something more ambivalent, less perfect.&quot; In September 1996, before the start of Season Four, O&#x27;Connor was not sure the series was tackling contemporary themes adequately. He wrote, &quot;Inevitably, though, there is an element of exhaustion seeping through the concept. With the Cold War over, perhaps the Roddenberry optimism seems merely naive as headlines bring news of murderous divisions between Serbs and Muslims, Kurds and Turks, Israelis and Palestinians, Irish Catholics and Protestants, and so on across an increasingly depressing globe. &quot;Star Trek&quot; offered a vision that leapt 300 years into the future. For too many people today, three years would seem a stretch.&quot;

Cynthia Littleton, writing for &quot;Variety&quot; in 1998, summarized the ratings the series was receiving at the end of its sixth season: &quot;&quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; may not go out on as high a Nielsen note as &quot;Next Generation&quot;, which wrapped a hugely successful run in 1994, but &quot;DS9&quot; is hardly floundering. The series, which bowed in January 1993, consistently ranks among the top three first-run syndication hours in household and demographic ratings.&quot;

In a 1999 edition of the Australian science-fiction magazine &quot;Frontier&quot;, Anthony Leong suggested that &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; had not initially been envisaged to include a war story arc from the beginning. He demonstrated a preference for how the plot of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; had been devised, while acknowledging how the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; writers had developed a continuing plotline: &quot;... it is rare for a series creator to envision how the series will develop over time. Furthermore, the creative process in dramatic television writing tends to be organic, as events in the series will unfold based on the events that preceded it. For example, were the wars with the Klingons and the Dominion on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; foreseen by its creators back in the first season? Of course not ... these events developed over time through the input of its writing staff.&quot;

In 2008, Nader Elhefnawy, contributor to The Internet Review of Science Fiction, asserted that, while less appreciated than other science-fiction series of the 1990s, &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; had developed an interesting cast of characters, &quot;thanks to the Dominion War, much of the richest and most exciting drama in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise&#x27;s history.&quot;

Owen Williams, writing for &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, opines that &quot;Star Trek&quot; as a whole has been slow to adapt and develop to new trends, while singling out &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; for special mention: &quot;... arguably even the ace &quot;DS9&quot; only got good in response to &quot;Babylon 5&quot; ...&quot; Adam Smith, chief features writer for &quot;Empire&quot; commented in a 2009 article that, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to choose the best episodes of &quot;DS9&quot; without mentioning the stories involving the Dominion War.&quot; He reported &quot;The Search&quot;, &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Far Beyond the Stars&quot; as the features staff&#x27;s favorite episodes for their portrayal of darker themes and creating a change in direction.

&quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; was nominated at the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films for a Saturn Award, from 1997 to 2000, in Best Genre Cable or Syndicated Series. It was nominated in technical and artistic categories at the Emmys in each season. Cinescape columnist Andrew Hershberger remarked in 2003 on the lack of critical success for science-fiction television: &quot;Nobody cool would dare vote for a sci-fi show [for Outstanding Drama Series] that didn&#x27;t have [Stanley] Kubrick or Chris Carter&#x27;s name attached to it ... If &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; was involved, you&#x27;d hear some real complaining on this end.&quot;

In 2016, a reviewer at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; applauded the Dominion War saga for being the &quot;richest narrative in the entire [Star Trek] universe.&quot;

===Academic perspectives===
Academics have noted how the Dominion War plotlines have explored the human psyche as much as outer space. Lincoln Geraghty praises the ending to the story arc and &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; as a series, and believes this is indicative of how the series manipulates the &quot;Star Trek&quot; ethos, identifying a theme of ambiguity as part of its continuing narrative. Karin Blair, writing in 1997 at the time of Season Five, felt that the series was reflecting trends for American culture to re-consider its place in the global community. Michele and Duncan Barrett comment on the &quot;declining faith in rationalism that haunts &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;&quot; in their book &quot;Star Trek: The Human Frontier&quot;.

In contrast, Robert Jewett and John Shelton Lawrence, authors of &quot;The Myth of the American Superhero&quot;, argue that the Dominion War plotlines in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; continue &quot;Star Trek&quot; portrayal of &quot;humanistic militarism&quot;, in that conflict is justified for the sake of humanity. Criticism is levelled at Paramount&#x27;s tie-in merchandising, in particular the slogan for the computer game &quot;Deep Space Nine: Dominion Wars&quot;, which is considered to emphasize the combat element at the expense of other themes.

While television commentators and fans have noted associations with the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, some academics have noted parallels between the portrayal of the Dominion War and other historical conflicts. Michele and Duncan Barrett identify a number of themes relating to World War I in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, especially &quot;in the bleak and costly alliances and endless casualty sheets that characterize the protracted Dominion War in &quot;DS9&quot;.&quot;

==Tie-in media==
A number of tie-in media titles have expanded on the Dominion War well beyond events depicted in the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; television series:

=== Novels ===
The Mirror Universe version of the Dominion appears in David Alan Mack&#x27;s novel &quot;Star Trek: Section 31 - Disavowed&quot;, published in 2014. The mirror Dominion is much like the regular universe&#x27;s version, except that the mirror Founders are much less authoritarian and are even subject to Dominion law.

==== &quot;The Dominion War&quot; (1998) ====

=== Video games ===

==== &quot;The Fallen&quot; (2000) ====

&quot;Star Trek: Deep Space NineThe Fallen&quot; (2000) is a third-person shooter video game loosely based on the &quot;Millennium&quot; trilogy of novels by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. Characters introduced during the Dominion War story arc appear in the game.
==== &quot;Dominion Wars&quot; (2001) ====

&quot;Star Trek: Deep Space NineDominion Wars&quot; (2001) is a real-time strategy video game set during the later seasons of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. The player is tasked with defending Federation assets against attacking Dominion forces.
====Others====
The Dominion is seen in the &quot;Star Trek: Armada&quot; video game. The first mission in the Federation campaign has the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E defend a starbase from rogue Jem&#x27;Hadar ships. Later, the game had a Borg armada invade Dominion space to capture a cloning facility to resurrect Locutus of Borg as a clone of Jean-Luc Picard. They are seen to have two types of ships in the game, destroyers and battleships.

The Dominion also make an appearance in &quot;Star Trek: Conquest&quot; as one of the major races and have three ship types: a Jem&#x27;Hadar Scout, a Jem&#x27;Hadar Cruiser and a Jem&#x27;Hadar Battleship.

The &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; game also features appearances by the Dominion, including several playable Dominion ships and characters. It continues the story of the Dominion fleet lost in the wormhole, the changeling Laas and the fate of the Founder leader after the Dominion War. The lost fleet was flung into the future and immediately began assaulting the Alpha Quadrant, unaware the war already concluded years before. The Female Changeling is released from prison briefly, to convince the armada to stop their assault and accept the peace treaty. The 2018 expansion &quot;Victory is Life&quot; introduces Jem&#x27;hadar as a playable race, and shows the Dominion (represented by the changeling character Odo) fighting a losing war with the hur&#x27;q, an alien species with connections to Klingon history.

<text>Princess Astrid of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este (born 5 June 1962), is the second child and first daughter of King Albert II and Queen Paola, and the younger sister to the current Belgian monarch, King Philippe. She is married to Prince Lorenz of Belgium, head of the Austria-Este branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, and is fifth in line of succession to the Belgian throne.

==Biography==
Princess Astrid was born one day before her father&#x27;s 28th birthday at the Belvédère Château in Laeken, northern Brussels, and was named after her late paternal grandmother, Astrid of Sweden, King Leopold III&#x27;s popular first wife, who had died in 1935 in a car accident aged 29. Princess Astrid&#x27;s godparents were her uncle Fabrizio, Prince Ruffo di Calabria-Santapau, 7th Duke di Guardia Lombarda, and her aunt Hereditary Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte of Luxembourg.

===Marriage and issue===
Princess Astrid married Archduke Lorenz of Austria-Este, subsequently head of the Archducal House of Austria-Este, on 22 September 1984 at the Church of Our Lady of Victories at the Sablon in Brussels. Lorenz is the eldest son of Robert, Archduke of Austria-Este (1915–1996), and Princess Margherita of Savoy-Aosta (1930–2022). Her husband was also created Prince of Belgium by Royal Decree on 27 November 1995.

Princess Astrid and Prince Lorenz have five children:
*Prince Amedeo Maria Josef Carl Pierre Philippe Paola Marcus d&#x27;Aviano of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este (born on 21 February 1986 at Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc in Woluwé-Saint-Lambert, Brussels). Married Elisabetta &quot;Lili&quot; Maria Rosboch von Wolkenstein on 5 July 2014 in Rome&#x27;s Basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere. They have three children:
** Archduchess Anna Astrid Marie of Austria-Este (born on 17 May 2016)
** Archduke Maximilian Joseph Lorenz Ettore Karl Marcus d&#x27;Aviano of Austria-Este (born on 6 September 2019)
** Archduchess Alix Lorenza Anne Marie Josephine of Austria-Este (born on 2 September 2023)
*Princess Maria Laura Zita Beatrix Gerhard d&#x27;Autriche-Este (Habsburg-Lorraine), Princess of Belgium (born on 26 August 1988 at Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc in Woluwé-Saint-Lambert, Brussels), married William Isvy on 10 September 2022 at Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels. They have one son:
** Albert Isvy (born on 26 January 2025)
*Prince Joachim Karl-Maria Nikolaus Isabelle Marcus d&#x27;Aviano of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este (born on 9 December 1991 at Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc in Woluwé-Saint-Lambert, Brussels).
*Princess Luisa Maria Anna Martine Pilar of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este (born 11 October 1995 at Clinique St Jean in Woluwé-Saint-Lambert, Brussels).
*Princess Laetitia Maria Nora Anna Joachim Zita of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este (born on 23 April 2003 at Clinique St Jean in Woluwé-Saint-Lambert, Brussels).

==Royal role==
Astrid was formerly President of the Belgian Red Cross, a position which ended on 31 December 2007. She declined to stand again for election to the role in light of internal struggles in the organisation in reconciling its Flemish-speaking and French branches, each of which seeks greater autonomy. The princess is also a colonel in the Medical Component of the Belgian Armed Forces. Her official residence is the Royal Castle of Laeken on the edge of Brussels.

She is a member of the Honorary Board of the International Paralympic Committee.

In April 2015, the Princess took over the reins of the Prince Albert Fund from her father King Albert.

=== Special Envoy ===
Princess Astrid has been for many years an advocate for landmine survivors rights, participating actively in the work of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, also known as the Ottawa Treaty, since Belgium joined in 1998.

In 2013, the Princess was named Special Envoy of the convention, and has promoted the acceptance of a global ban on landmines and promoted the rights of survivors in various UN meetings.

In 2014, she met with Minister of Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdallah, to encourage Oman to join the treaty, which occurred a few months later.

In 2019, she carried out a mission to Lebanon to promote the convention. In Beirut she met with President Michel Aoun, and Minister of National Defense Elias Bou Saab.

<doc id="207636" wikidata="Q31129" url="?curid=207636" title="Queen Paola of Belgium">
<text>Paola Margherita Maria-Antonia Consiglia dei Principi Ruffo di Calabria (born 11 September 1937) is a member of the Belgian royal family who was Queen of the Belgians during the reign of her husband, King Albert II, from 9 August 1993 to 21 July 2013.

==Early life and family background==
Paola Margherita Maria-Antonia Consiglia Ruffo di Calabria was born in Forte dei Marmi, Tuscany, Italy, the seventh and youngest child of Fulco, Prince Ruffo di Calabria, 6th Duke of Guardia Lombarda (1884–1946), who was a World War I Italian flying ace. Her mother was Donna Luisa Gazelli dei Conti di Rossana e di Sebastiano (1896–1989), a matrilineal descendant of the Marquis de Lafayette, a hero of the American Revolution. She is predominantly of Italian and French ancestry, with a dash of Belgian, Dutch and German. In her youth, she was hailed as one of the leading beauties of Europe.

Queen Paola is fluent in Italian, French, German and English. Less fluent, and the cause of occasional criticism, is her Dutch, the mother tongue of nearly 60 percent of Belgians.

==Marriage and family==

In 1958, the Prince of Liège went to the Vatican to witness the coronation of Pope John XXIII. At a reception at the Belgian embassy, the Prince met Italian Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria. &quot;We were both shy, so we only talked a little&quot;, Paola said later about their first meeting. Prince Albert later proposed marriage to Paola and she accepted. Their engagement was announced at the Palace of Laeken in 1959. The couple married at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels on 2 July 1959. They have three children together: King Philippe (born 15 April 1960), Princess Astrid (born 5 June 1962), and Prince Laurent (born 19 October 1963).

The couple&#x27;s marriage was in trouble by the 1970s and Albert fathered a daughter by Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, named Delphine. Despite starting divorce negotiations at the time, the couple remained married, and reconciled in the 1980s, celebrating it with a new symbolic wedding ceremony.

==Activities==

Apart from her activities in the company of King Albert II, Paola devotes her time to social issues mainly in the social and cultural sphere.

The Queen has demonstrated interest in the contemporary Belgian arts, visiting &quot;Venetian Biennale&quot; several times. She has acquired works of Jan Fabre, Michael Borremans and others for the Royal collection. The Queen has often met with such artists as Luc Tuymans and Dirk Braeckman.

Paola takes a keen interest in the protection and preservation of Belgium&#x27;s heritage. She makes numerous visits to cultural sites, from Beguine convents to early 19th century industrial facilities. Paola is interested in both traditional and contemporary crafts, and takes every opportunity to encourage the exercise and teaching of craft professions.

Paola keeps abreast of contemporary art and regularly supports major exhibitions and artistic performances both in Belgium and abroad. On her initiative, contemporary artists have had the opportunity to design and make original works within the Royal Palace of Brussels.

In 1992, Paola established the Queen Paola Foundation. The foundation focused on integration and training for young people. The foundation&#x27;s activities are geared towards social integration, support for teachers at all levels of the education system and schools in socio-economically disadvantaged areas.

Paola is an honorary chairman of the Queen Elisabeth Music Chapel and Missing Children Europe.

==Health==
In 2015, the court announced Queen Paola was taking &quot;a period of total rest&quot; following doctors&#x27; orders. They also announced that she had to cancel a planned visit to the Biennale in Venice. Further communications were kept private. Paola sent a message to Grosio, where she was expected to visit the residence of her aunt the Marchioness Margherita Pallavicini Mossi. Newspapers believed that the Queen suffered a stroke during the holiday. The palace later announced she was being treated for a cardiac arrhythmia. In 2016, she fractured a vertebra and in the following year she suffered from a fractured femoral neck and broke her hip. In September 2018, her visit to Venice was cut short and she was flown to a hospital in Belgium due to what was described by the palace as a &quot;health problem&quot;, though some outlets speculated that she had suffered a stroke. In March 2022, she was ordered to rest for two months after breaking her arm in a fall.

<doc id="207637" wikidata="Q154594" url="?curid=207637" title="Lucian Freud">
<text>Lucian Michael Freud (; 8 December 1922 – 20 July 2011) was a British painter and draughtsman, specialising in figurative art, and is known as one of the foremost 20th-century English portraitists. He was born in Berlin, the son of Jewish architect Ernst L. Freud and the grandson of Sigmund Freud. Freud got his first name &quot;Lucian&quot; from his mother in memory of the ancient writer Lucian of Samosata. His family moved to England in 1933, when he was 10 years old, to escape the rise of Nazism. He became a British naturalized citizen in 1939. From 1942 to 1943 he attended Goldsmiths&#x27; College, London. He served at sea with the British Merchant Navy during the Second World War.

His early career as a painter was influenced by surrealism, and afterwards by expressionism, but by the early 1950s his often stark and alienated paintings tended towards realism. Freud was an intensely private and guarded man, and his paintings, completed over a 60-year career, are mostly of friends and family. They are generally sombre and thickly impastoed, often set in unsettling interiors and urban landscapes. The works are noted for their psychological penetration and often discomforting examination of the relationship between artist and model. Freud worked from life studies, and was known for asking for extended and punishing sittings from his models.

==Early life and family==
Born in Berlin on 8 December 1922 (the city was then part of the Weimar Republic), Freud was the son of a German Jewish mother, Lucie (née Brasch), and an Austrian Jewish father, Ernst L. Freud, an architect who was the fourth child of Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Lucian, the second of their three boys, was the elder brother of the broadcaster, writer and politician Clement Freud (thus uncle of Emma and Matthew Freud) and the younger brother of Stephan Gabriel Freud.

The family emigrated to St John&#x27;s Wood, London, in 1933 to escape the rise of Nazism. Lucian became a British subject in 1939, having attended Dartington Hall School in Totnes, Devon, and later Bryanston School, for a year before being expelled owing to disruptive behaviour.

==Early career==
Freud briefly studied at the Central School of Art in London, and from 1939 to 1942 with greater success at Cedric Morris&#x27; East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing in Dedham, relocated in 1940 to Benton End, a house near Hadleigh, Suffolk. He also attended Goldsmiths&#x27; College, part of the University of London, in 1942–43. He served as a merchant seaman in an Atlantic convoy in 1941 before being invalided out of the service in 1942. As a result of his poor physical condition he was able, unlike his two brothers, to avoid conscription. 

In 1943, the poet and editor Meary James Thurairajah Tambimuttu commissioned the young artist to illustrate a book of poems by Nicholas Moore entitled &quot;The Glass Tower&quot;. It was published the following year by Editions Poetry London and comprised, among other drawings, a stuffed zebra and a palm tree. Both subjects reappeared in &quot;The Painter&#x27;s Room&quot; on display at Freud&#x27;s first solo exhibition in 1944 at the Lefevre Gallery. In the summer of 1946, he travelled to Paris before continuing to Greece for several months to visit John Craxton. In the early fifties he was a frequent visitor to Dublin where he would share Patrick Swift&#x27;s studio. He remained a Londoner for the rest of his life.

Freud was one of a number of figurative artists who were later characterised by artist R. B. Kitaj as a group named the &quot;School of London&quot;. This group was a loose collection of individual artists who knew each other, some intimately, and were working in London at the same time in the figurative style. The group was active contemporaneously with the boom years of abstract painting and in contrast to abstract expressionism. Major figures in the group included Freud, Kitaj, Francis Bacon, Frank Auerbach, Michael Andrews, Leon Kossoff, Robert Colquhoun, Robert MacBryde, and Reginald Gray. Freud was a visiting tutor at the Slade School of Fine Art of University College London from 1949 to 1954.

==Mature style==

Freud&#x27;s early paintings, which are mostly very small, are often associated with German Expressionism (an influence he tended to deny) and Surrealism in depicting people, plants and animals in unusual juxtapositions. Some very early works anticipate the varied flesh tones of his mature style, for example &quot;Cedric Morris&quot; (1940, National Museum of Wales), but after the end of the war he developed a thinly painted very precise linear style with muted colours, best known in his self-portrait &quot;Man with a Thistle&quot; (1946, Tate) and a series of large-eyed portraits of his first wife, Kitty Garman, such as &quot;Girl with a Kitten&quot; (1947, Tate). These were painted with tiny sable brushes and evoke Early Netherlandish painting.

From the 1950s, he began to focus on portraiture, often nudes (though his first full-length nude was not painted until 1966), to the almost complete exclusion of everything else, and by the middle of the decade developed a much more free style using large hog&#x27;s-hair brushes, concentrating on the texture and colour of flesh, and much thicker paint, including impasto. &quot;Girl with a White Dog&quot;, 1951–1952, (Tate) is an example of a transitional work in this process, sharing many characteristics with paintings before and after it, with relatively tight brushwork and a middling size and viewpoint. He would often clean his brush after each stroke when painting flesh, so that the colour remained constantly variable. He also started to paint standing up, which continued until old age, when he switched to a high chair. The colours of non-flesh areas in these paintings are typically muted, while the flesh becomes increasingly highly and variably coloured. By about 1960, Freud had established the style that he would use, with some changes, for the rest of his career. The later portraits often use an over life-size scale, but are of mostly relatively small heads or in half-lengths. Later portraits are often much larger. In his late career he often followed a portrait by producing an etching of the subject in a different pose, drawing directly onto the plate, with the sitter in his view.

Freud&#x27;s portraits often depict only the sitter, sometimes sprawled naked on the floor or on a bed or alternatively juxtaposed with something else, as in &quot;Girl With a White Dog&quot; (1951–52) and &quot;Naked Man With Rat&quot; (1977–78). According to Edward Chaney, &quot;The distinctive, recumbent manner in which Freud poses so many of his sitters suggests the conscious or unconscious influence both of his grandfather&#x27;s psychoanalytical couch and of the Egyptian mummy, his dreaming figures, clothed or nude, staring into space until (if ever) brought back to health and/or consciousness. The particular application of this supine pose to freaks, friends, wives, mistresses, dogs, daughters and mother alike (the latter regularly depicted after her suicide attempt and eventually, literally mummy-like in death), tends to support this hypothesis.&quot;

The use of animals in his compositions is widespread, and often he features a pet and its owner. Other examples of portraits with both animals and people in Freud&#x27;s work include &quot;Guy and Speck&quot; (1980–81), &quot;Eli and David&quot; (2005–06) and &quot;Double Portrait&quot; (1985–86). He had a special passion for horses, having enjoyed riding at school in Dartington, where he sometimes slept in the stables. His portraits solely of horses include &quot;Grey Gelding&quot; (2003), &quot;Skewbald Mare&quot; (2004), and &quot;Mare Eating Hay&quot; (2006). Wilting houseplants feature prominently in some portraits, especially in the 1960s, and Freud also produced a number of paintings purely of plants. Other regular features included mattresses in earlier works, and huge piles of the linen rags with which he used to clean his brushes in later ones. Some portraits, especially in the 1980s, have very carefully painted views of London roofscapes seen through the studio windows.

Freud&#x27;s subjects, who needed to make a very large and uncertain commitment of their time, were often the people in his life; friends, family, fellow painters, lovers, children. He said, &quot;The subject matter is autobiographical, it&#x27;s all to do with hope and memory and sensuality and involvement, really.&quot; However the titles were mostly anonymous, and the identity of the sitter not always disclosed; the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire had a portrait of one of Freud&#x27;s daughters as a baby for several years before he mentioned who the model was. In the 1970s Freud spent 4,000 hours on a series of paintings of his mother, about which art historian Lawrence Gowing observed &quot;it is more than 300 years since a painter showed as directly and as visually his relationship with his mother. And that was Rembrandt.&quot;

Freud painted from life, and usually spent a great deal of time with each subject, demanding the model&#x27;s presence even while working on the background of the portrait. &quot;Ria, Naked Portrait 2007&quot;, a nude completed in 2007, required sixteen months of work, with the model, Ria Kirby, posing all but four evenings during that time. With each session averaging five hours, the painting took approximately 2,400 hours to complete. A rapport with his models was necessary, and while at work, Freud was characterised as &quot;an outstanding raconteur and mimic&quot;. Regarding the difficulty in deciding when a painting is completed, Freud said that &quot;he feels he&#x27;s finished when he gets the impression he&#x27;s working on somebody else&#x27;s painting&quot;. Paintings were divided into day paintings done in natural light and night paintings done under artificial light, and the sessions, and lighting, were never mixed.

It was Freud&#x27;s practice to begin a painting by first drawing in charcoal on the canvas. He then applied paint to a small area of the canvas, and gradually worked outward from that point. For a new sitter, he often started with the head as a means of &quot;getting to know&quot; the person, then painted the rest of the figure, eventually returning to the head as his comprehension of the model deepened. A section of canvas was intentionally left bare until the painting was finished. The finished painting is an accumulation of richly worked layers of pigment, as well as months of intense observation.

==Later career==

Freud painted fellow artists, including Frank Auerbach and Francis Bacon and produced a large number of portraits of the performance artist Leigh Bowery. He also painted Henrietta Moraes, a muse to many Soho artists. A series of huge nude portraits from the mid-1990s depicted Sue Tilley, or &quot;Big Sue&quot;, some using her job title of &quot;Benefits Supervisor&quot; in the title of the painting, as in his 1995 portrait &quot;Benefits Supervisor Sleeping&quot;, which in May 2008 was sold by Christie&#x27;s in New York for $33.6 million, setting a world record auction price for a living artist.

Freud&#x27;s most consistent model in his later years was his studio assistant and friend David Dawson, the subject of his final, unfinished work. Towards the end of his life he did a nude portrait of model Kate Moss. Freud was one of the best known British artists working in a representational style, and was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 1989.
His painting &quot;After Cézanne&quot;, noteworthy because of its unusual shape, was purchased by the National Gallery of Australia for $7.4 million. The top left section of this painting has been &#x27;grafted&#x27; on to the main section below, and closer inspection reveals a horizontal line where these two sections were joined.

In 1996, the Abbot Hall Art Gallery in Kendal mounted a major exhibition of 27 paintings and thirteen etchings, covering Freud&#x27;s output to date. The following year the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art presented &quot;Lucian Freud: Early Works&quot;. The exhibition comprised around 30 drawings and paintings done between 1940 and 1945. In 1997 Freud received the Rubens Prize of the city of Siegen. From September 2000 to March 2001, the Museum für Moderne Kunst Frankfurt was able to show 50 paintings, drawings and etchings from the late 1940s to 2000 in a larger overview exhibition despite the artist&#x27;s considerable resentment towards Germany. All print media bore the motif of Freud&#x27;s outstanding painting &quot;Sleeping by the Lion Carpet&quot; (1995-1996) depicting the nude Sue Tilley. In addition to some of his most important nude portraits of women, the large-format picture &quot;Nude with leg up (Leigh Bowery)&quot; from 1992 was also shown in Frankfurt, which was removed in the Metropolitan Museum New York from the exhibition in 1993. The Frankfurt exhibition was realised in a personal dialogue between curator Rolf Lauter and Lucian Freud and is thus the only project Freud authorised in direct cooperation with a German museum. The major retrospective at London&#x27;s Hayward Gallery in 1988 was the focal point for the BBC &quot;Omnibus&quot; programme which saw one of the very few conversations with Freud ever recorded, in this case with &quot;Omnibus&quot; director Jake Auerbach. The conversations with the artist were made possible by Duncan MacGuigan from Acquavella Galleries New York. This was followed by a large retrospective at Tate Britain in 2002. In 2001, Freud completed a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. There was criticism of the portrayal in some sections of the British media. In 2005, a retrospective of Freud&#x27;s work was held at the Museo Correr in Venice scheduled to coincide with the Biennale. In late 2007, a collection of etchings went on display at the Museum of Modern Art.

Freud died in London on 20 July 2011 and is buried in Highgate Cemetery. Archbishop Rowan Williams officiated at the private funeral.

==Art market==
In 2008 &quot;Benefits Supervisor Sleeping&quot; (1995), a portrait of civil servant Sue Tilley, sold for $33.6 million – the highest price ever at the time for a work by a living artist. At a Christie&#x27;s New York auction in 2015, &quot;Benefits Supervisor Resting&quot; sold for $56.2 million.
On 13 October 2011, his 1952 &quot;Boy&#x27;s Head&quot;, a small portrait of Charlie Lumley, his neighbour, reached $4,998,088 at Sotheby&#x27;s London contemporary art evening auction, making it one of the highlights of the 2011 auction autumn season.

On 10 November 2015 Freud&#x27;s 2004 painting &quot;The Brigadier&quot;, a portrait of Andrew Parker Bowles in his British Army uniform, sold for $34.89 million US at Christie&#x27;s in New York City, beating the $30 million US presale estimate for the work.

==Personal life==
In the 1940s Freud and fellow artists Adrian Ryan and John Minton were in a homosexual love triangle. After an affair with Lorna Garman, he went on to marry, in 1948, her niece Kitty Garman, the illegitimate daughter of sculptor Jacob Epstein and socialite Kathleen Garman. They had two daughters, Annabel Freud and the poet Annie Freud, before their marriage ended in 1952. Kitty Freud, later known as Kitty Godley (after her marriage in 1955 to economist Wynne Godley), died in 2011.

In late 1952, Freud eloped with Guinness heiress and writer Lady Caroline Blackwood to Paris, where they married in 1953; they divorced in 1959. During the late 1970s and 80s, Freud was also famously in a relationship with fellow painter Celia Paul. Freud acknowledged fourteen of his children, two from Freud&#x27;s first marriage and 12 by various mistresses. Writer Esther Freud and fashion designer Bella Freud are his daughters by Bernadine Coverley.

From the 1970s, until his death in 2011. Freud&#x27;s home and studio was at 138 Kensington Church Street in Kensington, London, a house built in 1736-1737. The building has been Grade II listed since 1984.

Freud was noted for his aversion to being photographed; he once kicked a photographer on his departure from a private dinner.

<text>Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar (August 16, 1798 – December 19, 1859) was an American attorney, politician, poet, and leading political figure during the Texas Republic era. He was elected as the second president of the Republic of Texas after Sam Houston. He was known for waging war against bands of Cherokee and Comanche peoples to push them out of Texas, and for establishing a fund to support public education.

==Early life==
Lamar was born in 1798 in Louisville, Georgia, as the second eldest of nine siblings, growing up at Fairfield, his father&#x27;s cotton plantation near Milledgeville, then the state capital. His family was descended from French Huguenot Thomas Lamar, who had settled in Maryland in 1660. His parents, John and Rebecca (Lamar) Lamar, who were first cousins through Thomas&#x27; sons John and Thomas, had allowed his mother&#x27;s brother Zachariah to name their sons; he named them after his favorite historical heroes. The elder brother, Lucius, was named for the Roman statesman Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus; the younger, Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar, for French heroes Napoleon Bonaparte and Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau. The family had connections with other families throughout Georgia and the South. Confederate politician John Basil Lamar was a first cousin to Lamar. As a child, Lamar loved to read and educated himself through books. Although he was accepted to Princeton University (then called the College of New Jersey), he chose not to attend. He started work as a merchant and then ran a newspaper, but both of those enterprises failed.
In 1823, Lamar&#x27;s family connections helped him to gain a position as the private secretary to the newly elected Georgia Governor George M. Troup. In this position, Lamar issued press releases and toured the state, giving speeches on behalf of the governor. On one of his trips, he met Tabitha Burwell Jordan, whom he married in 1826. They had a daughter together.

When Troup lost his re-election bid in 1828, Lamar moved with his family to Columbus, Georgia, where he established the &quot;Columbus Enquirer.&quot; This venture was much more successful than his previous business attempts. In 1830, his wife Tabitha died of tuberculosis. Lamar was deeply affected and took time to recover his drive. He withdrew his name from consideration for re-election to the Georgia Senate, in which he had served one term.

After traveling, Lamar began to study law. He was admitted to the bar in 1833 and ran an unsuccessful campaign for a seat in the U.S. Congress.

==Texas Revolution==
Lamar&#x27;s brother Lucius committed suicide in 1834. A grief-stricken Lamar began traveling again to ease his sorrow. In the summer of 1835, he reached Texas, then part of Mexico. He decided to stay, where he was visiting his friend James Fannin. Fannin had recently settled there and was working as a slave trader in Velasco.

After a trip back to Georgia, Lamar returned to Texas. Learning of a battle for independence, he traveled with his horse and sword to join Sam Houston&#x27;s army in spring 1836, and distinguished himself with bravery at the Battle of San Jacinto. On the eve of the battle, Lamar courageously rescued two surrounded Texians, an act that drew a salute from the Mexican lines. One of those rescued was Thomas Jefferson Rusk, later appointed as Texas Secretary of War. Lamar was promoted that night from private to colonel and given command of the cavalry during the battle the following day.

Houston noted in his battle report: &quot;Our cavalry, 61 in number, commanded by Mirabeau B. Lamar, (whose gallant and daring conduct on the previous day, had attracted the admiration of his comrades and called him to that station), placed on our right, completed our line.&quot;

After Texas achieved independence from Mexico, Lamar was appointed as the Secretary of War in the interim Texian government. In 1836, he was elected to the position of Vice President of Texas.

==President of Texas==
Lamar, the unanimous choice as the nominee of the Democratic Party for the president to succeed Houston, was elected. He was inaugurated on December 1, 1838. Houston talked for three hours in his farewell address, &quot;which so unnerved Lamar that he was unable to read his inaugural speech.&quot; It was given by his aide, Algernon P. Thompson. Lamar&#x27;s vice president was David G. Burnet.

Several weeks later, in his first formal address to the Texas Congress, Lamar urged that the Cherokee and Comanche tribes be driven from their lands in Texas, even if the tribes had to be destroyed. He proposed to create a national bank and to secure a loan from either the United States or Europe. Finally, he stated his opposition to potential annexation to the United States and desire to gain recognition of the Republic of Texas by European nations.

He ordered attacks against the Indian tribes. In 1839, Texian troops drove the Cherokee bands from the state. Houston&#x27;s friend, Chief Bowles, was killed in battle, and Houston was furious with Lamar. The government conducted a similar campaign against the Comanche. Although losing many lives, the Comanche resisted leaving the area. Lamar believed the &quot;total extinction&quot; of the Indian tribes was necessary to make the lands available to whites. He drove the Indians out at the Battle of the Neches, where 500 Texans attacked 800 American Indians of several different tribes. Of these 800, between 400 and 500 were women, children, and elders. The Texians and Rangers who attacked the tribes were fully armed, while the Indians had an estimated 16–24 rifles and pistols. Before the attack, Duwali, Gatunwali, Big Mush, and other chiefs and leaders asked for time to gather their crops, then they would go in peace, but Lamar would not wait.. Lamar ordered Secretary of War Albert Sidney Johnston and General Thomas J. Rusk to run them out of Texas.

Lamar appointed a commission to select a permanent site for the capital of the Republic. After two months of debate, they recommended the small town of Waterloo, along the Colorado River toward the center of the state. The town was renamed Austin after the pioneer Stephen F. Austin. By October 1839, all of the records and employees were relocated there from Houston. That same year, Lamar founded the Texas State Library.

During his administration, Lamar sent three separate agents to Mexico to negotiate a peace settlement, all of which failed. Lamar failed to gain official recognition for Texas from Great Britain, France, and Belgium; it always eluded the would-be nation. He did succeed in getting the three nations to send observers, who would provisionally investigate the issue. He did not succeed in getting loans approved from them. To fill the treasury, he authorized issuance of a large amount of Republic of Texas paper money, known as Redbacks. The paper money was virtually worthless. Spending doubled during Lamar&#x27;s term, and combined with the worthless currency, caused financial difficulties for the government.

Lamar wanted the Rio Grande to be the western boundary of Texas. He wanted to send an expedition to New Mexico to conquer it, and convince the residents, still loyal to Mexico, to join the Republic. The Texas Congress refused to fund the expedition in 1839 and 1840. In June 1841, Lamar took $89,000 from the treasury and sent an expedition on his own initiative. It was questioned on constitutional grounds. Its members were arrested when they reached Santa Fe, and were told they would soon be released. Instead, under guard, they were marched to prison in Mexico City, and many died during the journey.

Lamar has been called &quot;the Father of Texas Education&quot; because of his provisions of land to support it. During his administration, he convinced the legislature to set aside three leagues of land in each county to be devoted to school development. He also allotted 50 leagues of land for the support of two universities, later developed as Texas A&amp;M University (1876), under the Morrill Act, and The University of Texas (1883). Although no facilities were constructed during his term, he provided the base for a statewide public school system. Government gave 18,000 acres of public land for public schools. He wanted education to be a priority to cultivate a knowledgeable citizenry.

In keeping with other slave societies in the South, Texas prohibited free blacks from schools. A public school system was not firmly established until after the American Civil War, when the Reconstruction era legislature created an endowment to finance a school system. In 1869, it passed a law to give the public school fund the proceeds from sale of public lands. The constitution of that year authorized the legislature to establish school districts and appoint directors. Freedmen&#x27;s children were included in the system, despite much opposition.

When Lamar left office in 1841, Texas was almost $7 million in debt compared to $1.4 million when he was inaugurated in 1838. The majority of the debt was accrued from carrying out his policies.

==Later years==

Houston was elected again as president after Lamar. The latter returned to service in the army, and distinguished himself in the U.S. Army at the Battle of Monterrey during the Mexican–American War. During this time, money was tight in Texas; Lamar borrowed money from his banker cousin Gazaway Bugg Lamar. Some of the letters on this subject between the two still exist. In late 1847, he was assigned as a post commander at Laredo, but disliked the job, as he wanted more action.

Lamar was elected from Eagle Pass in the Texas Legislature for several years after Texas was annexed to the United States in 1845. In 1857, President James Buchanan appointed Lamar as the Minister to Nicaragua, and a few months later to Costa Rica. He served in Managua for 20 months before returning to Texas in October 1859 because of poor health. He died of a heart attack at his Richmond plantation on December 19, 1859.

Lamar&#x27;s volume of collected poems, &quot;Verse Memorials&quot;, was published in 1857 (New York, W.P. Fetridge &amp; Co., 224 pages ).

<doc id="207641" wikidata="Q7999803" url="?curid=207641" title="Wik Peoples v Queensland">
<text>Wik Peoples v The State of Queensland (commonly known as the Wik decision) is a decision of the High Court of Australia delivered on 23 December 1996, on whether statutory leases extinguish native title rights. The court found that the statutory pastoral leases under consideration by the court did not bestow rights of exclusive possession on the leaseholder. As a result, native title rights could coexist depending on the terms and nature of the particular pastoral lease. Where there was a conflict of rights, the rights under the pastoral lease would extinguish the remaining native title rights.

The decision provoked a significant debate in Australian politics. It led to intense discussions on the validity of land holdings in Australia. Some political leaders criticised the court for being out of touch and for introducing uncertainty into Australian life. The Howard government formulated a &quot;10-point plan&quot; to bring certainty to land ownership in Australia. This plan led to the longest debate in the Australian Senate’s history.

==Background==
In 1992, the High Court held in Mabo that the common law of Australia recognises Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders had a form of &quot;native title,&quot; which reflected the entitlement of indigenous inhabitants to their traditional lands in accordance with their laws or customs. Native title was not defined by the Wik decision. However, it is commonly accepted to include rights to perform ceremonies or to gather foods or medicines.

==The Wik peoples==

The Wik peoples are a grouping of Aboriginal Australians who reside in north-eastern Australia. They live in an area on the western Cape York Peninsula between 11° 40&#x27; and 14° 50&#x27; south latitude. The group comprises the peoples of Wik-Ompom, Wik-Mungkana, Wik-Paacha, Wik-Thinta, Wik-Ngathara, Wik-Epa, Wik-Me&#x27;anha, Wik-Nganthara, Wik-Nganychara, and Wik-Liyanh. Their traditional lands centre around the Archer River and the Edward River. The term Wik actually means &quot;speech&quot; or &quot;language&quot; in the Aboriginal languages of the region.

The Wik people have previously litigated native title-type claims. In 1975, part of the Aboriginal reserve at Aurukun created in 1957 had been excised by the Queensland Government for a bauxite mining lease. The lease was granted to the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation Pty Limited (Comalco) through a special Act of Parliament called the &quot;Aurukun Associates Act 1975&quot; (Qld). There was an initial win in the Supreme Court of Queensland against the lease. However, an appeal to the Privy Council in London led to the decision being overturned.

In the 1970s, the then-Aboriginal Development Commission attempted to purchase part of a pastoral lease. This lease was over part of traditional lands used by the &quot;Winchanam&quot; clan. The Bjelke-Petersen government refused to allow the purchase of the lease. A challenge in the High Court ensued, and the action was won by the corporation. However, the Queensland Government frustrated the decision by declaring the land a national park.

==Basis of the Wik claim==

The Wik people and the Thayorre people claimed to be the holders of native titles over two areas of land. The first is known as &quot;Holroyd River Holding&quot; and the other is known as &quot;Michellton Pastoral Leases.&quot; Their claim before the court was on the basis that their native title was not extinguished by the granting of the various leases over the land. They asserted that their native title rights continued and co-existed with the pastoral lease. The Wik Peoples also claimed declarations, which challenged the validity of the Special Bauxite Mining Leases which had been granted by the Queensland Government pursuant to the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation Pty Limited Agreement Act 1957 (Qld) and the Aurukun Associates Agreement Act 1975 (Qld). These claims were brought before the commencement of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth), came into operation. That law came into being because of the High Court’s decision in Mabo v Queensland (No 2).

===The Holroyd River Holding===
The Holroyd River Holding is in area. The first Holroyd lease was issued to Marie Stuart Perkins in 1945. It was granted under the Land Act of 1910 (Qld). This lease was surrendered in 1973. The first lease was granted for pastoral purposes. A second lease for thirty years was issued under the Land Act 1962 (Qld) in 1975 to John Herbert Broinowski, John Darling, James Maurice Gordon, and Ross Farm Pty Ltd. The second lease was not limited to pastoral purposes. The Holroyd land was subject solely to a claim by the Wik people.

===The Mitchellton Lease===
The Mitchellton Lease was in area. It is located north of Normanton, in far north Queensland. The claim extends from the Mitchell River to the Edward River in the north and west to the Gulf of Carpentaria. It is in the District of Cook which was opened up for occupation in 1866. The first Michellton lease was granted to Alfred Joseph Smith, Thomas Alexander Simpson and Marshall Hanley Woodhouse in 1915 under the Land Act 1910. The lessees did not take up actual possession of the land. The first lease was forfeited for non-payment of rent in 1918. A second lease was granted in 1919. The new lessee also did not take up possession. The lease was surrendered in 1921. Each lease was issued for pastoral purposes. Since 1922 the land had been reserved for the benefit of Aboriginals. Both the Wik people and the Thayorre People made claims over the area.

===The mining leases===
There were also what were called the Comalco and Aurukun matters. Comalco Aluminium Ltd held several bauxite mining leases issued by the Queensland State Government under the Comalco Act 1957 (Qld). In each of these claims, the Wik peoples alleged that the mining leases were invalid because the Queensland Government owed fiduciary duties as a trustee to the Wik people, and that those duties had been breached by the granting of the mining leases. The Aurukun claim also included an attack on an agreement called the Aurukun Associates Agreement entered into under the Aurukun Associates Agreement Act 1975 (Qld).

==The original decision==
The Wik peoples lodged their claim on 30 June 1993 in the Federal Court of Australia. The claim was lodged before the commencement of Native Title legislation, introduced into Australia following the decision in the Mabo case. The State of Queensland was the first respondent to the claim. The Commonwealth of Australia was the second respondent. At a later stage, the Thayorre People were also joined as respondents. The Thayorre people also cross-claimed because their claim overlapped the claim of the Wik Peoples.
The matter came on for hearing before Drummond. Five preliminary questions were posed for determination by the Court. Drummond heard the claim between 17 and 26 October and 14 and 15 December 1994. He delivered his decision 29 January 1996 in Brisbane.

On 29 January 1996 Drummond gave judgment on the five preliminary questions that had been identified. He found that the granting of the leases over the two land claims extinguished any native title rights to those lands. In Drummond’s opinion, each lease gave exclusive possession to the lessees. Drummond did not have to decide whether the Wik people or the Thayorre people actually were the holders of native title rights in respect of the land.

On 22 March 1996 Justice Spender granted the appellants leave to appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court against the judgment. Subsequent to that grant leave, the High Court made orders that the appeal be removed into the High Court for determination by that court.

==The appeal==

The appeal was heard by the High Court between 11 and 13 June 1996 with all 7 judges sitting, Gerard Brennan CJ, Daryl Dawson, John Toohey, Mary Gaudron, Michael McHugh, William Gummow and Michael Kirby JJ. The court reserved its decision until 23 December 1996. The Court decided in favour of the Wik people by a four/three majority. Each of the majority judges wrote separate judgments in support of their decision. The majority focused on the meaning of a “lease” as used in Australia at the time. The court focused on the purpose for which the leases were granted at that time in light of the social and economic conditions of the times. The minority judges wrote a single joint judgment. They focused on the leases as well, but concluded that the leases conferred the right to exclusive occupation of the land thereby extinguishing native title.

The majority decision became a proposition for:

* A pastoral lease does not confer rights of exclusive possession on the holder of the lease.
* The rights and obligations depend on the nature and terms of the lease.
* Where the rights of the lease are in conflict with native title rights, then the rights under the lease will prevail to the extent of any inconsistency.
* The granting of a lease does not extinguish any remaining native title rights.

==Political response to the decision==

The decision provoked significant political and public reactions in Australia. Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson said that “country people are concerned with the Wik Native Title problem&quot; Some State Premiers went further and publicly commented that suburban backyards were under threat from native title claims. Queensland Premier Rob Borbidge even commented that some of the High Court judges were &quot;dills about history.&quot; Prime Minister John Howard in a press conference held up a map of Australia purporting to show how much of Australia was at risk from native title claims. The Bulletin led with a cover in December 1997 depicting &quot;Land Rights: How Much is Too Much&quot; with the clear implication that all land holdings in Australia were under threat from native title claims as a result of the decision.

Others pointed out that the decision only affected leasehold land and not the overwhelming majority of Australia which is freehold land held under “fee simple”. The High Court had made clear that native title was extinguished in that situation. They emphasised the “shared use” of the land with a theme of &quot;co-existence.&quot;

==The Wik 10 Point Plan==

The Howard government promised a response to the decision and came up with the “Wik 10 Point Plan”. Howard argued the decision &quot;pushed the pendulum back too far in the Aboriginal direction (and) the 10 Point Plan will return the pendulum to the centre&quot;. The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 (Cth) was drawn up to implement the plan. It was introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament on 4 September 1997. It was passed by the House of Representatives, however, the Senate made 217 amendments to the bill and returned it to the lower house for reconsideration. The House of Representatives agreed to half of the changes but returned the bill to the Senate again. It was eventually passed one year later on 8 July 1998 by the Senate after the longest debate in the history of the Senate. One commentator described the amendments to native title law as using a &quot;legal sledge hammer to crack a political nut&quot;.

==Legal commentary on the decision==

Maureen Tehan describes the Wik decision as the high point in law for native title in Australia. The decision balanced the rights of the pastoralists and the rights of Aboriginal people, but placed the primacy of pastoral title over native title. Richard Bartlett argues that the decision placed great significance on the principle of equality at common law. Philip Hunter notes that criticism of the High Court was &quot;totally unjustified&quot;. He states that the High Court recognised that native title was in no way destructive of the title of pastoralists. He points out that where native title clashed with pastoral interests, pastoral interests would always override native title. 

Frank Brennan described the approach of the court as taking into account an &quot;incomplete reading of the history&quot;. Gim Del Villar goes further and argues that the Wik judgment is &quot;flawed&quot; from a historical perspective. He argues that the court used questionable historical material to reach its conclusion that pastoral leases were not common law leases. He notes that in 1870 the Supreme Court of Queensland held that pastoral leases did confer a right of exclusive possession which reflected a common belief at that time that leases did extinguish native title. Del Villar points to despatches from Earl Grey in which there is the clear implication that native title was not to be respected when granting pastoral leases.

<doc id="207642" wikidata="Q527512" url="?curid=207642" title="X Games">
<text>The X Games are a series of action sports events founded by ESPN Inc. and aired on ESPN networks and ABC. In late 2022, ESPN sold the long-running property to MSP Sports Capital, a private equity firm co-founded by Jahm Najafi and Jeff Moorad, though the event is still aired on ESPN and ABC despite the ownership change.

The X Games have been held all over the world and typically include sports such as skateboarding, BMX, freestyle motocross, skiing and snowboarding. Participants compete to win bronze, silver, and gold medals, in addition to prize money. X Games events also feature music and culture elements like live music performances, athlete autograph sessions, and interactive, family-friendly exhibitions. 

The inaugural X Games were held during the summer of 1995 in Providence and Newport in Rhode Island. The competition often features new tricks such as Tony Hawk&#x27;s 900 in skateboarding, Shaun White&#x27;s Double McTwist 1260 in snowboard, Dave Mirra&#x27;s Double Backflip in BMX, Travis Pastrana&#x27;s Double Backflip in freestyle motocross, Heath Frisby&#x27;s first snowmobile frontflip, Chuck Carothers&#x27;s first body varial in freestyle motocross, Henrik Harlaut&#x27;s first nose-butter triple cork in Ski Big Air, Gus Kenworthy&#x27;s first switch triple rodeo in a ski slopestyle competition and Torstein Horgmo&#x27;s first landed triple cork in a snowboard competition. 

The X Games gained media exposure due to their big name sponsors, top-tier athletes, and consistent fan attendance. As the &quot;Journal of Sport Management&quot; (2006) explains, Generation X and Millennials are the two demographics most highly valued by marketers. This creates a broad approach on marketing towards that certain demographic, which is why the X Games marketing and economic outlook is so &quot;out of the box&quot;. According to a 2008 report by ESPN, in 1997, the Winter X Games inaugural year, 38,000 spectators attended the four-day event. In 1998, the attendance dropped to 25,000 spectators. But just two years later, a record attendance of 83,500 people attended the Winter X Games East Coast debut.

As part of the X Games, there have been performances by various rock bands over the years, as well as a DJ being on-site at all events. The X Games have made it a point since its founding to stage an eco-friendly event. Such measures include using biodiesel fuel in their vehicles and organizing recycling campaigns.

==X Games Winter Events==

The X Games Aspen 2002 was the first time an X Games event was televised live and also had coverage by ESPN&#x27;s flagship news program, &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. Viewership across the three networks that carried coverage of the event – ABC Sports, ESPN, and ESPN2 – exceeded 2001&#x27;s household average by 30% according to Nielsen Media Research. The event also reached record highs in several demographic categories. To accommodate the first-time live coverage, nighttime competitions were added, resulting in record attendance for the Aspen/Snowmass venue in Colorado.

2002 was the first time X Games was held in Aspen at Buttermilk Mountain. X Games has been held in Aspen every winter since 2002. Also in 2002, ESPN announced the establishment of the X Games Global Championship. The Global Championship featured two distinct venues hosting competitions in summer and winter action sports simultaneously. It consisted of six teams of the world&#x27;s top athletes, grouped together by their region of origin, to compete in the four-day event. The winter sports were held in Whistler Blackcomb Resort in British Columbia, and the events included snowboarding and skiing. 

The first Winter X Games took place at Snow Summit ski resort in Big Bear Lake, California, in 1997. The following two years, X Games was held at Crested Butte Mountain Resort in Colorado. The two years following that, Mount Snow, Vermont, hosted X Games.

During X Games Aspen 2015, ESPN used camera drones to capture aerial views of the athlete&#x27;s runs. This was a first for ESPN.

==Global expansion==
X Games Asia have been held annually since 1998.

In May 2003, the X Games held the Global Championships, a special event where athletes from five continents competed across 11 disciplines. The event was held in two locations: the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, and Whistler, British Columbia. The final team results, in order, were the United States, Europe, Australia, Asia, and South America.

In May 2011, ESPN held a bid to select three host cities in addition to Los Angeles, Aspen, and Tignes, France, to form a six-event calendar for the next three years beginning in 2013. In May 2012, the selected cities were announced: Barcelona, Spain; Munich, Germany; and Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil. The two European cities have hosted the Summer Olympic Games in the past, whereas Brazil has provided several X Games competitors. Since 2010, Winter X Games Europe has been held in Tignes and also began holding events in Norway in 2016. An event in Sydney, Australia was held in 2018 and winter and summer events were also planned for 2019 and 2020 in China and a return trip to Norway in 2020.

X Games Chiba, the first edition to take place in Japan, was introduced in 2022.

<doc id="207649" wikidata="Q7723514" url="?curid=207649" title="The Club (1980 film)">
<text>The Club is a satirical film based on the play of the same name by the Australian playwright and dramatist David Williamson. It follows the fortunes of an Australian rules football club over the course of a season, and explores the clashes of individuals from within the club. It was inspired by the backroom dealings and antics of the Victorian Football League&#x27;s Collingwood Football Club.

The film was produced in 1980, written by Williamson and directed by Bruce Beresford. It stars John Howard, Jack Thompson, Graham Kennedy and Frank Wilson. The film was described as a &quot;hilarious, sharply observed slice of life&quot;.

The film features Mike Brady&#x27;s 1979 football anthem &quot;Up There Cazaly&quot;.

==Plot==
The club pays a high price for Tasmanian recruit, Geoff Hayward (Howard). Geoff does not play well initially, infuriating the dedicated coach, Laurie Holden (Thompson). With the club playing so badly, Laurie&#x27;s coaching days may be over soon.

Club president Ted Parker (Kennedy) is forced to resign following an assault on a stripper. The incident could have been kept quiet but for backstabbing from various board members, especially Jock (Frank Wilson) and Gerry (Alan Cassell).

Laurie discovers that the board wants to sack him (arising from a long grudge held against Laurie by Jock), so Laurie inspires Geoff to start playing well. It is later revealed that Jock used to be Laurie&#x27;s coach when Laurie played for the club. Jock was jealous because Laurie nearly surpassed his club record of 282 games. He also lost a Grand Final by making poor decisions under the influence of alcohol.

Laurie then told the members that Jock was drunk. After being dismissed as coach, he was replaced by Laurie and tried to sabotage the club his best to get back at him. The team start winning and eventually make the grand final, beating Fitzroy. The film ends with Gerry saying, &#x27;Laurie&#x27;s a great coach&#x27;, then looking at Jock, &#x27;God knows why some members of the board wanted to get rid of him&#x27;.

===Differences from the play===
The major differences between the play and the film versions include:
*In the film, there are some scenes that take place outside The Club&#x27;s hallowed halls. In the play, all of the scenes are inside The Club and are acted out in real time, whereas the film takes place over a season. 
*In the play, The Club is never named to be one specific club. In the film, Collingwood&#x27;s guernsey is used, the entire film was shot on location at Collingwood&#x27;s then home ground of Victoria Park, the Collingwood theme song is used as a motif, and Collingwood players such as Peter Daicos and Rene Kink, as well as coach Tom Hafey, are featured in speaking and non-speaking roles. Although only commentators refer to Collingwood by name, everyone else in the movie refers to it as &#x27;the club&#x27;.
*In the film, the incident with the stripper is shown, whereas in the play, she is an unseen character.
*The play does not show the club winning the premiership, instead ending after Laurie vows to make the finals and dissolve the club&#x27;s board.

==Characters==
The plot revolves around six central characters:

* Geoff Hayward (John Howard) – a new recruit with a huge reputation lured to the club with big money in an attempt to haul the team up the ladder. Hayward resents that the club sees him as a commodity to be bought and sold.

* Laurie Holden (Jack Thompson) – the respected and earnest coach of the club whose champion playing career was ended by injury just short of the record number of games played for the club. Holden&#x27;s credo is honesty and discipline, but the team has struggled to find success under his coaching and he knows that he is under pressure to avoid the sack. Holden is generally regarded as the second best coach in the league behind Hawthorn&#x27;s &quot;Rostoff&quot;, who was also the coach the club&#x27;s board wish to replace him with.

* Ted Parker (Graham Kennedy) – club president and owner of a pie factory named &quot;Parker&#x27;s Pies&quot;. Parker is just a fan with a lot of money that the club want a share of. Although his knowledge of the game&#x27;s intricacies is limited, he has watched virtually every game played by the club since he was a small boy. When Hayward demands an extra A$10,000 to join the club, Parker puts up the money himself.

* Jock Riley (Frank Wilson) – ex-champion player from an earlier era, the successful coaching predecessor to Laurie and now an influential committeeman. Jock has a finger on the pulse of everything that happens around the club and he regularly meddles when he thinks it necessary. He wants to get rid of Holden so that his most games coached record with the club remains unbeaten. The name Jock is a tribute to long serving Collingwood player and coach Jock McHale.

* Gerry Cooper (Alan Cassell) – a new breed administrator recently hired to drag the club into a more professional era. Gerry sees the club as a business, his appointment as merely a job and eschews emotion in his decision making. He is in it more for personal gain than for the benefit of the club.

* Danny Rowe (Harold Hopkins) – Player and captain of the team. His career is almost finished and the club consider trading him.

===Minor characters===
Prominent football commentators such as Fred Cook, Lou Richards, Jack Dyer, Bob Davis and reporters Scot Palmer and Ron Carter have parts in the film, as do Collingwood footballers at the time, Peter Daicos (as himself) and Rene Kink (as Tank O&#x27;Donohue). Collingwood&#x27;s coach at the time, Tom Hafey, features as the assistant coach. Maggie Doyle plays Geoff Hayward&#x27;s girlfriend.

==Setting==
In the script, Williamson uses the arrival of Hayward at the club as a device that gets these characters interacting to express their opinions on Hayward&#x27;s poor early-season form and attitude, thus exploring several themes relevant to the culture of any sporting club. The original play and the movie were created at a time when Australian football was in a state of flux, moving from a semi-professional state (where players were paid &quot;beer&quot; money for their services) to the modern, fully professional, franchised structure that is known today as the Australian Football League. This process began in the late 1970s/early 1980s.

==Box office==
&quot;The Club&quot; grossed at the box office in Australia.

Williamson rated the film as one of the best made from his work, saying it was &quot;very well done&quot;.

<doc id="207655" wikidata="Q750452" url="?curid=207655" title="Astral Weeks">
<text>Astral Weeks is the second studio album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison. It was recorded at Century Sound Studios in New York during September and October 1968, and released in November of the same year by Warner Bros. Records.

The album&#x27;s music blends folk, blues, jazz, and classical styles, signalling a radical departure from the sound of Morrison&#x27;s previous pop hits, such as &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; (1967). The lyrics and cover art portray the symbolism equating earthly love and heaven that would often feature in the singer&#x27;s subsequent records. His lyrics have been described as impressionistic, hypnotic, and modernist, while the record has been categorized as a song cycle or concept album.

&quot;Astral Weeks&quot; did not originally receive promotion from Morrison&#x27;s record label and was not an immediate success with consumers or critics. Its standing eventually improved greatly, with praise given to Morrison&#x27;s singing, arrangements and songwriting, and the album has been viewed as one of rock music&#x27;s greatest and most important records (a reputation the singer himself has dismissed). It was placed on numerous widely circulated lists of the best albums of all time and has had an enduring effect on both listeners and musicians.

Forty years after the album&#x27;s release, Morrison performed all eight of its songs live for the first time at two Hollywood Bowl concerts in November 2008; this performance was later released as &quot;Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;.

==Background==
At the beginning of 1968, Van Morrison became involved in a contract dispute with Bang Records that kept him away from any recording activity. This occurred after the sudden death of the label&#x27;s founder Bert Berns. Born with a congenital heart defect, Berns had a fatal heart attack, and was discovered dead in a New York hotel room on 30 December 1967. Prior to Berns&#x27;s death, he and Morrison had experienced some creative difficulties; Berns had been pushing Morrison in a more pop-oriented direction, while Morrison wanted to explore newer musical terrain. Berns&#x27;s widow, Ilene Berns, held Morrison and this conflict responsible for her husband&#x27;s death. Years later she would downplay this scenario, but Morrison&#x27;s then girlfriend Janet (Planet) Rigsbee has since gone on record describing Ilene Berns&#x27;s subsequent vindictiveness towards Morrison.

Following Bert Berns&#x27;s death, Ilene Berns inherited the contracts of Bang Records. Morrison&#x27;s annual option on his recording contract was also due less than a week after Berns&#x27;s funeral. Legally bound to Bang Records, Morrison was not only kept out of the studio, but also found himself unable to find performing work in New York as most clubs refrained from booking him, fearing reprisals. (Bert Berns was notorious for his connections to organized crime, and those connections still affected artists like Morrison and Neil Diamond trying to leave Bang Records, even after Berns&#x27;s death.) Ilene Berns then discovered that her late husband had previously been remiss in filing the appropriate paperwork to keep Morrison (still a British citizen) in New York, and contacted Immigration and Naturalization Service in an attempt to have Morrison deported. However, Morrison managed to stay in the U.S. when Janet Rigsbee agreed to marry him. Once married, Morrison and Rigsbee moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he found work performing in local clubs. Morrison began performing with a small electric combo doing blues numbers, and songs from &quot;Blowin&#x27; Your Mind!&quot; and from Morrison&#x27;s Them band days. Two of the musicians soon left but Morrison retained the bassist, Tom Kielbania, a student at the Berklee School of Music. Morrison decided to try an acoustic sound, and he and Kielbania began performing shows in coffee houses in the Boston area as an acoustic duo with Morrison playing guitar and Kielbania on upright bass. Before this, Morrison had primarily recorded and performed with electric musicians. The acoustic medium would provide him &quot;greater vocal improvisation and a freer, folkier feel&quot;.

Later, Kielbania heard jazz-trained flautist John Payne for the first time while sitting in on a jam session. He invited Payne to the club where he played with Morrison, hoping Morrison would invite him to join them. After allowing Payne to sit in on one performance, Morrison extended an invitation, which Payne accepted. The trio of Payne, Kielbania, and Morrison continued performing for four months. In the weeks they played at the Catacombs, they began to develop the template for &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;. It was around this time that Warner Bros. Records approached Morrison, hoping to sign him. Presumably, their interest focused on his prior success with &quot;Brown-Eyed Girl&quot;, not on Morrison&#x27;s current acoustic work. Regardless, their interest allowed Morrison to return to the recording studio.

At the time, Warner Bros. had a deal with Inherit Productions, the production arm of Schwaid-Merenstein, which was founded by manager Bob Schwaid (who worked for Warners Publishing) and producer Lewis Merenstein. Merenstein received a call from Warner Bros. to see Morrison in Boston, and related how eight or nine producers had gone to hear Morrison, thinking they were going to hear &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; only to find that &quot;it was another person with the same voice&quot;. Merenstein first heard Morrison play at Ace Recording studio and recalled that when Morrison played the song &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; for him, &quot;I started crying. It just vibrated in my soul, and I knew that I wanted to work with that sound.&quot; While Merenstein was visiting Morrison, Schwaid set to work on resolving Morrison&#x27;s contractual troubles with the help of legendary Warner Bros. executive Joe Smith, who would ultimately sign Morrison to Warner Bros.

Still legally bound to Bang Records, Morrison would yet have more issues with them in the future. For the time being, Schwaid managed to free him from those obligations, under several conditions. First, Morrison had to write and submit to Web IV Music (Bert Berns&#x27;s publishing company) three original compositions per month over the course of one year. Morrison fulfilled that obligation by recording thirty-six nonsense songs in a single session. Such action risked legal reprisals, but ultimately none transpired. Morrison then had to assign Web IV half of the copyright to any musical composition written and recorded by Morrison &quot;and&quot; released as a single within one year from 12 September 1968. That demand became a moot point when Warner Bros. refrained from releasing any singles during that time, as no single was released from &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;. Finally, Morrison had to include two original compositions controlled by Web IV on his next album. Morrison fulfilled that demand with two of his own compositions, &quot;Madame George&quot; and &quot;Beside You&quot;, although the versions subsequently released were vastly different musically from the original versions recorded with Bang.

There were still demands that weren&#x27;t given on paper, which Smith tried to deal with through Don Rickles&#x27;s manager, Joe Scandore. Scandore, whom Smith described as &quot;connected&quot;, set up an unusual arrangement where Smith had to arrive one evening at an abandoned warehouse on 9th Avenue in Manhattan at 6 p.m. with a bag containing $20,000 USD in cash. According to Smith, &quot;I had to walk up three flights of stairs, and they were four guys. Two tall and thin, and two built like buildings. There was no small talk. I got the signed contract and got the hell out of there, because I was afraid somebody would whack me in the head and take back the contract and I&#x27;d be out the money.&quot; When asked if he ever saw these men again, Smith replied, &quot;No. They weren&#x27;t in the music business.&quot;

==Recording sessions==
With his legal matters resolved, Morrison now had the freedom to proceed with recording his Warner Bros. debut album, with the recording sessions taking place at the Century Sound Studios in New York on 25 September, 1 and 15 October 1968. The live tracks for the sessions were performed by Morrison on vocals and acoustic guitar in a separate vocal booth with the other musicians playing together on upright bass, lead acoustic guitar, vibes, flute, and drums. The strings and horns constituted the only instruments added subsequently to the initial recording sessions. Morrison said later &quot;They ruined it. They added strings. I didn&#x27;t want the strings. And they sent it to me, it was all changed. That&#x27;s not &#x27;Astral Weeks&#x27;.&quot;

Producer Lewis Merenstein had a background in jazz, and according to Merenstein, Morrison &quot;was not an aficionado of jazz when I met him. R&amp;B and soul, yes; but jazz, no.&quot; For the &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; recording sessions, Merenstein first contacted veteran bassist Richard Davis. Perhaps best known for his work with Eric Dolphy, Davis essentially served as the session leader, and it was through Davis that Merenstein recruited guitarist Jay Berliner, percussionist Warren Smith Jr., and drummer Connie Kay. All of these musicians had strong backgrounds in jazz; Berliner had worked closely with Charles Mingus and Kay was part of the Modern Jazz Quartet. Morrison was still working with Kielbania and Payne but, for these sessions, they were essentially replaced. According to Kielbania, &quot;I got to show all the bass lines to Richard Davis. He embellished a lot of them, but I gave him the feeling.&quot;

Davis proved, perhaps, to be the most pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions. &quot;If you listen to the album, every tune is led by Richard and everybody followed Richard and Van&#x27;s voice&quot;, says Merenstein. &quot;I knew if I brought Richard in, he would put the bottom on to support what Van wanted to do vocally, or acoustically. Then you get Jay playing those beautiful counter-lines to Van.&quot; Davis was not impressed by Morrison, not out of disdain or any preconceived notions, but rather because Morrison&#x27;s professional comportment generally did not meet Davis&#x27;s expectations. &quot;No prep, no meeting&quot;, recalls Davis. &quot;He was remote from us, &#x27;cause he came in and went into a booth ... And that&#x27;s where he stayed, isolated in a booth. I don&#x27;t think he ever introduced himself to us, nor we to him ... And he seemed very shy&quot;. Drummer Connie Kay later told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he approached Morrison and asked &quot;what he wanted me to play, and he said to play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less sat there and jammed.&quot; Morrison&#x27;s impression of the sessions was &quot;The songs came together very well in the studio. Some of the tracks were first takes. [But] the musicians were really together. Those type of guys play what you&#x27;re gonna do before you do it, that&#x27;s how good they are.&quot; He told Ritchie Yorke that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album. &quot;One was about Jesse James and the other about trains. They were both just basic blues numbers. That&#x27;s why they didn&#x27;t fit in with the album.&quot;
For the &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; sessions, apparently they did not employ any lead sheets, or at least none were distributed to the musicians. &quot;What stood out in my mind was the fact that he allowed us to stretch out&quot;, recalls Berliner. &quot;We were used to playing to charts, but Van just played us the songs on his guitar and then told us to go ahead and play exactly what we felt.&quot; Berliner actually had great appreciation for the freedom given to him and the band; something few, if any, of them were used to. &quot;I played a lot of classical guitar on those sessions and it was very unusual to play classical guitar in that context&quot;, says Berliner.

The first session, held in the evening on 25 September 1968, produced four recordings that made it to the album. Only three had initially been intended for inclusion: &quot;Cyprus Avenue&quot;, &quot;Madame George&quot;, and &quot;Beside You&quot;. Although not scheduled to play, Payne still attended the first session and listened as another flautist played his parts. To this day, nobody recalls the name of this flautist, nor has he been identified on any of the surviving documentation; he does play flute on the released takes of &quot;Beside You&quot; and &quot;Cyprus Avenue&quot; but is not included in the album credits. When Morrison tried to squeeze in one last tune during the end of that first session, Payne spoke up and pleaded to Merenstein to permit him to participate. Payne was then allowed to play on what became the title track of the album – &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; – the fourth song produced from this initial session. For the remainder of the sessions, John Payne played on every song.

The next session, according to John Payne, occurred early in the morning, but it did not work and nothing from this session worked for the final album. &quot;It just didn&#x27;t happen&quot; says Payne. &quot;It was the wrong time of day for jazz musicians to create. I think that by the end of that session we all knew that nothing was going to be used. They just said, let&#x27;s forget it.&quot; Jay Berliner was not available, so Barry Kornfeld was recruited to play lead guitar in his place. According to Merenstein, there was tension at this second session and it was stopped after about three hours. Morrison was quoted by Ritchie Yorke as saying the album was recorded in &quot;two eight-hour sessions, plus two overdub sessions. That was the whole album.&quot; In his biography, Clinton Heylin gives the date for the second session as 1 October and states that &quot;Only &#x27;As Young Lovers Do&#x27; from this session would make the album&quot; contending that this is the reason for the different &quot;lounge-jazz sound&quot; on this track. Other biographers have primarily noted that the early morning first of October session was abandoned without producing any of the songs on the album.

The third and final session, in the evening on 15 October, produced four more recordings that completed the album — &quot;The Way Young Lovers Do&quot; &quot;Sweet Thing&quot;, &quot;Ballerina&quot; and &quot;Slim Slow Slider&quot;. Davis expressed to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that there was a &quot;certain feel about a seven-to-ten o&#x27;clock session&quot; and that &quot;the ambience of that time of day was all through everything we played&quot;. Both &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; and &quot;Ballerina&quot; were originally scheduled for the session, but the search for a &#x27;closer&#x27; consumed a considerable amount of time. They attempted (and rejected) a number of songs until Morrison suggested &quot;Slim Slow Slider&quot;. &quot;I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d ever done [it] live&quot;, recalls Payne. &quot;[Morrison] had a book full of songs ... I don&#x27;t know why he decided to do it ... And we were first doing it with the drums, with Richard Davis and Connie Kay and the guitar player and the vibe player and me and Van — all of us were playing. Then I started playing soprano sax on the thing, and Lew said, &#x27;OK, I wanna try it again. Start again. And I want just the bass, the soprano sax, and Van. It was a successful take, but it also came with a very long coda, prompting Merenstein to make a large cut during the editing process. Many of the tracks on &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; would be subjected to edits (mainly to tighten the performances), but the one on &quot;Slim Slow Slider&quot; was easily the most substantial. &quot;I would estimate three, five minutes of instrumental stuff&quot;, says Payne. &quot;We went through stages [until] we got to be avant-garde kind of weird, which is what you hear after the splice – all that weird stuff we&#x27;re playing – but there was a whole progression to that.&quot; According to Merenstein, before he cut it, the coda &quot;was a long, long ending that went nowhere, that just carried on from minute to minute ... If it had [some] relativity to the tune itself, I would have left it there.&quot;

The recording engineer for the album, Brooks Arthur, remembered the sessions in 2009: &quot;A cloud came along, and it was called the Van Morrison sessions. We all hopped upon that cloud, and the cloud took us away , and we made this album, and we landed when it was done.&quot; In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview in 1972, Morrison told John Grissim Jr.: &quot;I was really pretty happy with the album. The only complaint I had was that it was rather rushed. But I thought it was closer to the type of music I wanted to put out. And still is, actually.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==

&quot;Astral Weeks&quot; has poetic, stream-of-consciousness lyrics that evoke emotions and images instead of coherent, intellectual ideas and narratives. According to Guy Raz from NPR, it is a folk rock album, &quot;perhaps &quot;the&quot; seminal album of the folk-rock genre&quot;, while the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame online biography of Morrison said its music is trance-like folk jazz set to &quot;impressionistic, free-flowing&quot; lyrics. AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann, on the other hand, viewed the music as an amalgam of folk, blues, jazz, and classical music that is unlike rock.

Although usually described as a song cycle rather than a concept album, the songs do, when considered in their totality, seem to link together as one long song, forming an &quot;intangible narrative of unreachable worlds&quot; and delivered with what one writer calls &quot;a masterpiece of virtuoso singing&quot;. According to Charlie Gillett, the album has meditative songs that combine themes of nostalgia, drama, and Morrison&#x27;s personal mysticism and are performed in a blue-eyed soul style.

The album embraces a form of symbolism that would eventually become a staple of Morrison&#x27;s songs, equating earthly love and heaven, or as close as a living being can approach it. Morrison and Davis&#x27;s upright bass can be interpreted as the earth opposing Kay&#x27;s percussion and the string arrangement representing heaven and with Berliner&#x27;s lead acoustic guitar residing on a plane in between.

Van Morrison told Ritchie Yorke, one of his biographers, he wrote both of the songs &quot;Madame George&quot; and &quot;Cyprus Avenue&quot; in stream of consciousness: &quot;[&#x27;Madame George&#x27;] just came right out ... The song is just a stream of consciousness thing, as is &#x27;Cyprus Avenue&#x27; ...I didn&#x27;t even think about what I was writing.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Paste&quot; in 2009, Morrison said the songs on &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; were written &quot;prior to 1968 over a period of five years&quot;. In an NPR review he comments: &quot;It&#x27;s not about me. It&#x27;s totally fictional. It&#x27;s put together of composites, of conversations I heard—you know, things I saw in movies, newspapers, books, whatever. It comes out as stories. That&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s no more.&quot;

==Songs==

=== Side One – In The Beginning ===

==== &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; ====
The song &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; opens the album with the lines &quot;If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream/ Where immobile steel rims crack, and the ditch in the back roads stop&quot;, which according to Erik Hage shows that Morrison had &quot;once and for all pulled neck and neck with Dylan as a lyricist&quot;. Morrison described it as &quot;one of those songs where you can see the light at the end of the tunnel ... I don&#x27;t think I can elaborate on it any more than that.&quot; The words in the song: &quot;Talkin&#x27; to Huddie Ledbetter/Showin&#x27; pictures on the wall&quot; appear to be based on Morrison&#x27;s real life custom of carrying around a poster of Lead Belly and hanging it on the wall wherever he lived. (This was revealed in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview in 1978.)

==== &quot;Beside You&quot; ====

&quot;Beside You&quot;, the second song on the album, has been described as &quot;expressionistic poetry and a scattershot collection of images and scenarios&quot;. It begins with the classical guitar of Jay Berliner and Morrison&#x27;s voice circling each other. Morrison described it as &quot;the kind of song that you&#x27;d sing to a kid or somebody that you love. It&#x27;s basically a love song. It&#x27;s just a song about being spiritually beside somebody.&quot; It was originally recorded for Bang Records in December 1967. That first recording shows the pop music intentions of Bert Berns which give it a different sound from the &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; recording.

==== &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; ====

&quot;Sweet Thing&quot; is the only song on the album to look forward instead of backward. In the words of AllMusic: &quot;Over the endlessly descending, circular progression, Morrison sings positive lyrics about nature and a romantic partner, seemingly beginning in the middle of a thought: &#x27;And I will stroll the merry way. Paul Du Noyer wrote, &quot;Sweet Thing puts the singer in a hazy, pastoral paradise where he wanders in &#x27;gardens wet with rain&#x27;, or counts the stars in his lover&#x27;s eyes, and vows to &#x27;never grow so old again&#x27; or &#x27;read between the lines&#x27;. He pleads with his mind to keep quiet, so his heart can hear itself think. He yearns to obliterate experience and rediscover innocence.&quot; It has been a more popular cover song than any of the others on the album.

==== &quot;Cyprus Avenue&quot; ====
The song &quot;Cyprus Avenue&quot; is a three chord blues composition and served for many years as the closing song for most of Morrison&#x27;s live shows. Along with &quot;Madame George&quot;, it is the centerpiece of the album and both songs are Belfast related and highly impressionistic. The song is told from the point of view of an outsider watching from inside an automobile and getting tongue-tied as the refined school girl he fantasizes about appears and he imagines her a fine lady with &quot;rainbow ribbons in her hair&quot; in a carriage drawn by six white horses and &quot;returning from a fair&quot;. Van Morrison described Cyprus Avenue as &quot;a street in Belfast, a place where there&#x27;s a lot of wealth. It wasn&#x27;t far from where I was brought up and it was a very different scene. To me it was a very mystical place. It was a whole avenue lined with trees and I found it a place where I could think.&quot;

=== Side Two – Afterwards ===

==== &quot;The Way Young Lovers Do&quot; ====

&quot;The Way Young Lovers Do&quot; is described by Clinton Heylin as a &quot;lounge-jazz&quot; sound that &quot;still sticks out like Spumante at a champagne buffet&quot;. In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Greil Marcus also spoke of the song as a &quot;poor jazz-flavored cut that, is uncomfortably out of place on this record&quot;. Brian Hinton describes it as there being &quot;a Sinatra strut to Van&#x27;s voice, a blues knowingness with Stax brass, and a string section which swirls where previously it drifted.&quot; He describes it as &quot;about growing up, an adolescent first kiss&quot;.

==== &quot;Madame George&quot; ====

Called the other album masterpiece (along with Cyprus Avenue), &quot;Madame George&quot; is almost ten minutes long and tells of the mysterious madame &quot;in a corner playing dominoes in drag&quot;, among other things. It also has a setting of Cyprus Avenue in Belfast with impressionistic lyrics that give stream-of-conscious details that are seemingly unrelated. Erik Hage describes the effect of the sensory experience of the lyrics, the instrumentation and Morrison&#x27;s impassioned vocals on the listener and the album as being &quot;like some kind of twilight state between sleeping and wakefulness&quot;, engaging the listener to project themselves into the spell of the song. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; album reviewer wrote: &quot;The crowning touch is &#x27;Madame George&#x27;, a cryptic character study that may or may not be about an aging transvestite but that is certainly as heartbreaking a reverie as you will find in pop music.&quot; Morrison has denied that the song is about a transvestite, as others, including Lester Bangs, have believed. The original title of the song is &quot;Madame Joy&quot; and Morrison later changed the title although he actually sings the words &quot;Madame Joy&quot; in the song. An earlier recording for Bang Records with slightly altered lyrics, backing singers, a much swifter tempo and a &quot;bizarrely inappropriate party atmosphere&quot; had a considerably different tone from the 1968 &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; recording.

==== &quot;Ballerina&quot; ====

The oldest composition on &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; is &quot;Ballerina&quot;, which Morrison composed in 1966 while still a member of Them, around the same time he first met his future wife, Janet. Inspired by &quot;a flash about an actress in an opera house appearing in a ballet&quot; (according to Morrison), former Them guitarist Jim Armstrong recalls the band working on the song between engagements. &quot;[Morrison] had all these words&quot;, Armstrong says, &quot;we sort of formalized it, &#x27;cause there was no structure to it&quot;. Them performed the song one night in Hawaii, but it was not recorded until &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;. On the full-length version of &quot;Ballerina&quot; which first appeared on the 2015 expanded edition, the left and right audio channels are opposite to those on the originally released edited version.

==== &quot;Slim Slow Slider&quot; ====

&quot;Slim Slow Slider&quot; is the only song on the album to not have string overdubs and according to John Payne, Morrison had not played it live before. Like in the song &quot;T.B. Sheets&quot;, the singer tells of watching a young girl die, but in &quot;Slim Slow Slider&quot; the girl seems bent on her own self-destruction: &quot;I know you&#x27;re dying, baby / I know you know it too.&quot; The song ends abruptly with the words, &quot;Every time I see you, I just don&#x27;t know what to do.&quot; It has been said to be about a drug addict, but Morrison has only said that it&#x27;s about someone &quot;who is caught up in a big city like London or maybe is on dope, I&#x27;m not sure.&quot;

==Packaging==
According to Steve Turner, one of Van Morrison&#x27;s biographers, Irish painter Cecil McCartney influenced the titling of &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;. Morrison related how &quot;A friend of mine had drawings in his flat of astral projection. I was at his house when I was working on a song which began, &#x27;If I venture down the slipstream&#x27; and that&#x27;s why I called it &#x27;Astral Weeks&#x27;.&quot; &quot;It was a painting&quot;, McCartney corrects. &quot;There were several paintings in the studio at the time. Van looked at the painting and it suggested astral travelling to him.&quot; The album cover photograph of Van Morrison was taken by Joel Brodsky, best known for his &quot;Young Lions&quot; photoshoot with Jim Morrison. The squared circle in the cover photo is described as portraying &quot;the mystic symbol of the union of opposites; the sacred marriage of heaven and earth&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Astral Weeks&quot; sold poorly when it was first released in 1968. The album became a somewhat popular cult import in the United States, while in the United Kingdom it was largely overlooked by critics. The British magazine &quot;Beat Instrumental&quot; published a negative review of the record, finding Morrison&#x27;s songs monotonous and unoriginal. In &quot;NME&quot;, Nick Logan regarded it as a pale imitation of the guitarist José Feliciano&#x27;s 1968 &quot;Feliciano!&quot; album, which was one of the year&#x27;s best-selling records. With the exception of &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;″ title track, Logan felt the compositions were indistinguishable and &quot;suffer from being stuck in the same groove throughout&quot;. In the American magazine &quot;Stereo Review&quot;, editor Peter Reilly panned it as a &quot;free-verse mind bender of an album&quot;, plagued by nonsensical lyrics and incoherent singing from Morrison, especially on &quot;Madame George&quot;.

In 1969, Greil Marcus reviewed the album positively in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, saying that Morrison&#x27;s lyrics were thoughtful and deeply intellectual, &quot;in terms of the myths and metaphors that exist within the world of rock and roll&quot;. He believed both the music and lyrics captured the spirit of Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1967 album &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;, while calling &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; a &quot;unique and timeless&quot; record. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; later named it the album of the year. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; also called it one of the year&#x27;s best records, featuring Morrison&#x27;s &quot;small harsh voice&quot; backed by an attractive musical combo that &quot;verges on genius&quot; during &quot;Madame George&quot;. When his third album &quot;Moondance&quot; was released in 1970, Warner Bros. ran full-page advertisements remarking on the unavailability of &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; in record stores, calling it a &quot;damn shame&quot; that it &quot;ended up as what you might call a critically acclaimed but obscure album ... If you want it and can&#x27;t find it, yell at the store&#x27;s record buyer. Loud, because you&#x27;re the customer and you&#x27;re always right. Undo the veils of potential obscurity.&quot;

== Legacy and influence ==

&quot;Astral Weeks&quot;″ critical standing improved greatly over time. It became viewed as one of rock&#x27;s greatest records and a culturally significant work. Many factors afforded the record its strong reputation in rock criticism: its back story as a commercial underachiever and highly personal work for Morrison, its distinction from the rest of his discography, his artistic autonomy, the music&#x27;s song cycle composition, the enigmatic lyrics and quality of seriousness and originality as perceived by mature rock audiences and writers. According to Rob Sheffield, it was Morrison&#x27;s &quot;most beautiful and intense album&quot;, the foundation for his &quot;legend&quot; and a work that continues to captivate musicians and listeners. Lester Bangs said its anguished feeling resonated with him on first listen, calling it &quot;the rock record with the most significance in my life so far ... a record about people stunned by life, completely overwhelmed, stalled in their skins, their ages and selves, paralyzed by the enormity of what in one moment of vision they can comprehend.&quot; Irish musician Glen Hansard said it made him think about life with a greater depth of feeling, &quot;with a greater sense of fear and horror and desire than you ever imagined.&quot; Colin Larkin credited Morrison for fully realizing his ambition to &quot;create without pop&#x27;s constraints&quot; on &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, while AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann said its reputation among critics was justified because &quot;unlike any record before or since&quot;, it &quot;encompasses the passion and tenderness that have always mixed in the best postwar popular music&quot;.

&quot;Astral Weeks&quot; influenced future releases of other musicians such as Bono and Bruce Springsteen. Mike Ragogna with &quot;HuffPost&quot; wrote that &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; influenced Springsteen&#x27;s 1973 first album &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot; and two of the songs from his second. Steven Van Zandt, from Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band, has said: &quot;&quot;Astral Weeks&quot; was like a religion to us.&quot; According to writer Steve Turner, the album also became popular with travelers of the hippie trail, &quot;from Europe through to Kathmandu and there were even reports of vans painted in psychedelic colours being renamed &#x27;the Van Morrison&#x27;.&quot; In his 1975 book, Ritchie Yorke wrote &quot;It was almost as if Van Morrison, elusive at any time, had deliberately created an album of music which would indefinitely withstand the vulgarity of music industry image-making. Later they might say that other albums were reminiscent of &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, but they could never claim that &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; was like anything else.&quot; According to Greil Marcus, Martin Scorsese said that the first fifteen minutes of his 1976 film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; was based on &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;.
The critical recognition and renown of &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; came to overshadow Morrison&#x27;s subsequent work, as well as Morrison himself. According to biographer Johnny Rogan, his recording career was &quot;all too often crystallized in a single moment. Like the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; was perceived as a one-off whose critical standing allowed little discussion for other equally fascinating musical forays that followed.&quot; Morrison felt annoyed by the retrospective acclaim and claims about the record&#x27;s significance. In agreement with Logan&#x27;s original criticism, he later said he should have &quot;changed the arrangements because the arrangements are too samey ... four or five other songs should have had a change of mood.&quot; According to Robert Christgau in 1974, &quot;&quot;Astral Weeks&quot; is still considered unlistenable [sic] obscure by many astute observers&quot;. Merenstein, on the other hand, still admires the album: &quot;To this day it gives me pain to hear it. Pain is the wrong word—I&#x27;m so moved by it.&quot; In 2001, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, having shipped 500,000 copies in the US. Music historian Andrew Ford said the album&#x27;s commercial performance, much like its musical aesthetic, is similar to classical music: &quot;Neither instant nor evanescent: &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; will sell as many copies this year as it did in 1968 and has every year in between&quot;.

&quot;Astral Weeks&quot; has appeared in all-time best album polls worldwide. In 1978, it was voted the fourth best album of all time in Paul Gambaccini&#x27;s poll of 50 prominent American and English rock critics. It was also ranked second greatest by &quot;Mojo&quot; in 1995, and third by &quot;The Times&quot;. In 2003, it was ranked number 19 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revision and dropping to number 60 in the 2020 reboot of the list. In 1998, it was voted the ninth greatest album of all time in a &quot;Music of the Millennium&quot; poll conducted by HMV, Channel 4 and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; placed the record at number six on its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. &quot;Time&quot; included &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; in its 2006 list of the &quot;All-Time 100 Albums&quot;. When &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; was voted the best Irish album of all time in 2009, Niall Stokes wrote in &quot;Hot Press&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s an extraordinary work, packed with marvelously evocative songs that are rooted in Belfast but which deliver a powerful and lasting universal poetic resonance.&quot; The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It ranked number 16 in the 2000 third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

Marcus referred to the impact of the album, calling it a &quot;common language&quot;, and related in a 2009 interview that &quot;I was so shocked when I was teaching a seminar at Princeton just a couple years ago, and out of 16 students, four of them said their favorite album was &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;.&quot; Marcus goes on to say, &quot;Now, how did it enter their lives? We&#x27;re talking about an album that was recorded well before they were born, and yet it spoke to them. They understood its language as soon as they heard it.&quot; Elvis Costello described &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; as &quot;still the most adventurous record made in the rock medium, and there hasn&#x27;t been a record with that amount of daring made since&quot;. Johnny Depp, in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview in 2008, recalled how when he was a preteen his older brother (by ten years), tiring of Johnny&#x27;s favourite music of the time said, Try this.&#x27; And he put on Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;. And it stirred me. I&#x27;d never heard anything like it.&quot; Joan Armatrading has said that &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; was the first album she purchased as a teenager and that it opened her up musically. In August 2010, director and choreographer, Jessica Wallenfels, staged a production in Portland, Oregon, of a rock opera/story ballet of &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; called &quot;Find me Beside You&quot;.

==&quot;Astral Weeks&quot; revisited==

In November 2008, Van Morrison performed two concerts at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California playing the entire &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; album. The band featured Jay Berliner, who played on the original album. Morrison toured performing the album live throughout most of 2009, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; calling these concerts &quot;some of the most inspired performances of his whole career&quot;.

A live album entitled &quot;Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; was released by Morrison&#x27;s record label, Listen to the Lion, on 24 February 2009. It was also issued as a double vinyl LP album released the same date. A DVD featuring the Hollywood Bowl performances and entitled &quot;Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl: The Concert Film&quot; was released on 19 May 2009.

When asked by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor David Wild why he was performing the album again live after forty years, Morrison replied: &quot;It received no promotion, from Warner Bros.—that&#x27;s why I never got to play the songs live. I had always wanted to play the record live and fully orchestrated—&quot;that&quot; is what this is all about. I always like live recording and I like listening to live records too. I&#x27;m not too fond of being in a studio—it&#x27;s too contrived and too confining. I like the freedom of live, in-the-moment sound.&quot;

As for the songs on the original album, Morrison told &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; columnist Randy Lewis: &quot;The songs are poetic stories, so the meaning is the same as always—timeless and unchanging. The songs are works of fiction that will inherently have a different meaning for different people. People take from it whatever their disposition to take from it is.&quot;

On 30 October 2015, the album remastered was reissued by Warner Bros. Records with four session bonus tracks, including the full-length versions of both &quot;Ballerina&quot; and &quot;Slim Slow Slider&quot;.

<doc id="207661" wikidata="Q2357324" url="?curid=207661" title="Anti-Rightist Campaign">
<text>The Anti-Rightist Campaign () in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which lasted from 1957 to roughly 1959, was a political campaign to purge alleged &quot;Rightists&quot; within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the country as a whole. The campaign was launched by Chairman Mao Zedong, but Deng Xiaoping and Peng Zhen also played an important role. The Anti-Rightist Campaign significantly damaged democracy in China and turned the country into a &quot;de facto&quot; one-party state.

The definition of rightists was not always consistent, often including critics to the left of the government, but officially referred to those intellectuals who appeared to favor capitalism, or were against one-party rule as well as forcible, state-run collectivization. According to China&#x27;s official statistics published during the &quot;Boluan Fanzheng&quot; period, the campaign resulted in the political persecution of at least 550,000 people. Some researchers believe that the actual number of persecuted is between 1 and 2 million or even higher. Deng Xiaoping admitted that there were mistakes during the Anti-Rightist Campaign, and most victims received rehabilitation after 1959.

== History ==

===Background===
The Anti-Rightist Campaign was a reaction against the Hundred Flowers Campaign which had promoted pluralism of expression and criticism of the government, even though initiation of both campaigns was controlled by Mao Zedong and were integrally connected. Going perhaps as far back as the Long March there had been resentment against &quot;rightists&quot; inside the CCP, for example, Zhang Bojun.

While the Hundred Flowers Movement was going on, in 1956, Khrushchev published the &quot;On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences&quot;, which along with the ensuing riots in Poland and Hungary, had a large impact on China, where similar social unrest began to take place.

===First wave===
During the Hundred Flowers Movement, some ideas that were not tolerated by the Party were gradually raised. Some people claimed that &quot;now the students are on the streets and the citizens are following them&quot;, &quot;the situation is very serious&quot;, &quot;Chairman Mao and the others can&#x27;t go on, it&#x27;s time for them to step down&quot;; and that the CCP should take turns to rule with the democratic parties and open &quot;Hyde Park&quot; for public debate.

The first wave of attacks began immediately as the Hundred Flowers Campaign drew to a close in June 1957. At the time, Mao began to view criticism during the Hundred Flowers as a threat to the rule of the party. In mid-May, Mao began writing &quot;Things Are Beginning to Change&quot;, an article that was not completed until June 11. In the article he said, &quot;why is such a torrent of reactionary, vicious statements being allowed to appear in the press? to let the people have some idea of these poisonous weeds and noxious fumes so as to have them uprooted or dispelled.&quot; On June 8, 1957, Mao drafted an inner-party document, &quot;Muster Our Forces to Repulse the Rightists&#x27; Wild Attacks&quot;, saying that &quot;some bad capitalists, bad intellectuals, and reactionary elements in society are mounting wild attacks against the working class and the Communist Party in an attempt to overthrow the state power led by the working class.&quot; On the same day, &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; published an editorial &quot;What is this for?&quot;, expressing the same view as the inner-party document. These marked the beginning of the Anti-Rightist Campaign. By the end of the year, 300,000 people had been labeled as rightists, including the writer Ding Ling. Future premier Zhu Rongji, then working in the State Planning Commission, was purged in 1958. Most of the accused were intellectuals. The penalties included informal criticism, hard labor, and in some cases, execution. For example, Jiabiangou, a notable labor camp in Gansu, held approximately 3,000 political prisoners from 1957 to 1961, of whom about 2,500 died, mostly of starvation.

One main target was the independent legal system. Legal professionals were transferred to other jobs; judicial power was exercised instead by political cadres and the police.

===Second wave===
The second part of the campaign followed the Lushan Conference of July 2 – August 16, 1959, a meeting of top party leaders. The meeting condemned the PRC&#x27;s defense minister, General Peng Dehuai, a critic of the Great Leap Forward.

=== Criticism by Mao ===
Administering several provinces in the southwest, Deng proved so zealous in killing alleged counter-revolutionaries that even the chairman felt obliged to write to him. Mao urged Deng Xiaoping to slow down the campaign&#x27;s body count, saying:
==Legacy==
In a 2018 study by Zhaojin Zeng and Joshua Eisenman, analysing 144 counties within Anhui, Henan, and Jiangsu, it was found that the economic harm caused by the Anti-Rightist campaign continued for decades, even into 2000, compounded by existing issues with human capital at the time. The higher the percentage of the population were declared Rightists, the worse the economic outcomes would be in each county. Literacy rates were affected well into 1982, and academic performance at the high school level, as well as in compulsory education, continued to be affected into 2000. Counties that were previously Laoqu were found to have purged fewer Rightists than others because the party secretaries were local to the area. Negative correlations between the famine of the Great Leap Forward and China&#x27;s economic performance in 1982 were also found, and distinguished from the Anti-Rightist Campaign, confirming a 2017 study by Elizabeth Gooch; additionally, it was found that the effects were more significant compared to the Cultural Revolution.

==Rehabilitation==
After Mao&#x27;s death in 1976, many of the convictions were revoked during the Boluan Fanzheng period. At that time, under leader Deng Xiaoping, the government announced that it needed capitalists&#x27; experience to get the country moving economically, and subsequently the guilty verdicts of thousands of counterrevolutionary cases were overturned — affecting many of those accused of rightism and who had been persecuted for that crime the previous twenty two years. This came despite the fact that Deng Xiaoping and Peng Zhen were among the most enthusiastic prosecutors of the movement during the &quot;First Wave&quot; of 1957.

==Censorship in China==
In 2009, leading up the 60th anniversary of the PRC&#x27;s founding, a number of media outlets in China listed the most significant events of 1957 but downplayed or omitted reference to the Anti-Rightist Movement. Websites were reportedly notified by authorities that the topic of the movement was extremely sensitive.

<text>Command &amp; Conquer (C&amp;C) is a real-time strategy (RTS) video game franchise created and originally developed by Westwood Studios and currently owned by Electronic Arts. The first game was one of the earliest of the RTS genre, itself based on Westwood Studios&#x27; influential strategy game &quot;Dune II&quot; and introducing trademarks followed in the rest of the series. This includes full-motion video cutscenes with an ensemble cast to progress the story, as opposed to digitally in-game rendered cutscenes. Westwood Studios was purchased by Electronic Arts in 1998 and closed down in 2003. The studio and some of its members were absorbed into EA Los Angeles, which continued development on the series.

==History==
After Westwood Studios developed the critically acclaimed &quot;Dune II&quot;, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reported in 1993 that the company would not use the &quot;Dune&quot; license for Westwood&#x27;s next strategy game &quot;mostly because the programmers are tired of sand&quot;. The magazine stated that it would have &quot;new terrain and enemies&quot;, and that &quot;the design team is serious about doing a multi-player version&quot;.

&quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; was released worldwide by Westwood in 1995. The plot is set sometime in the near future where the Earth becomes contaminated by a mysterious substance known as Tiberium. A global war ensues between the UN-formed Global Defense Initiative to contain it and the cult quasi-state revolutionary Brotherhood of Nod, led by the enigmatic Kane, which seeks to harness it. Highly successful, it was followed by &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert&quot; in 1996 which is set in an alternate universe where the Soviet Union wages war with the Allies. Developed as the prequel to the original, the &quot;Red Alert&quot; series eventually became a separate, lighthearted and comic series, while the original game and its sequels became known as the &quot;Tiberium&quot; series, retaining its science fiction and serious tone. The first game is sometimes referred to as &quot;Tiberian Dawn&quot; as a result.

The original game was followed by &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun&quot; in 1999 and its expansion pack &quot;Firestorm&quot;. In 2002, Westwood Studios released &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade&quot;, a first-person shooter. &quot;Renegade&quot; was praised for its online features. A spin-off game in 2003, &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Generals&quot;, set in a more realistic near-future and featuring the United States, China and the Global Liberation Army was followed by an expansion pack, &quot;Zero Hour&quot;. &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars&quot; was released in 2007 and followed by the expansion pack &quot;Kane&#x27;s Wrath&quot;. &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight&quot;, released in 2010 as the conclusion to the &quot;Tiberium&quot; saga, received mixed reviews because of its deviation from traditional gameplay and story. The &quot;Red Alert&quot; series was continued by the 2000 title &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2&quot;, its expansion, &quot;Yuri&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3&quot; in 2008, which introduced a third faction, the Empire of the Rising Sun, which resembles Japan with futuristic robotic technology.

The series is primarily developed for personal computers running Microsoft Windows, although some titles have been ported to various video game consoles and Apple Mac. Other games for platforms such as iOS and web-based have also been developed. As of July 2010, the &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; franchise consists of eleven games and eight expansion packs. The first three games of the series have been released as freeware to promote the successors. A free-to-play game, entitled &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;, was in development with the studio Victory Games. It was set to be the next game in the series and was expected to be released in 2013. However, after a short alpha period the game was cancelled, and Victory Games disbanded by EA. The &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; series has been a commercial success with over 30 million &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; games sold as of 2009.

==Gameplay==
The &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; titles are real-time strategy games, with the exception of the first-person shooter &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade&quot;. A staple of the series is the parallel campaigns of various different factions to one central storyline. Games in the series also offered multiplayer game options, via LAN and modem connection. All games in the series have also offered online play, as well as &quot;skirmish&quot; matches in which players can face AI enemies.

All &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; real-time strategy games except &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Generals&quot; and its expansions have featured the &quot;side bar&quot; for navigation and control as opposed to many other similar games where the control bar is located on the bottom of the screen.

&quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; gameplay typically requires the player to construct a base and acquire resources, in order to fund the ongoing production of various types of forces with which to assault and conquer the opponent&#x27;s base. All available structures of the faction chosen by the player are constructed on-site at so-called &quot;construction yard&quot; - which typically begin as large-sized vehicles capable of deploying themselves into the aforementioned construction yards, called MCVs or Mobile Construction Vehicle. When a construction yard has finished building a new structure, the player can select a spot near to a preexisting structure in order to place it, where the prefabricated building will rapidly unfold in a distinctive manner.

In all games in the series except &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Generals&quot; and its expansion &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, funds are acquired by specialised &quot;harvester&quot; units which bring their cargo (Tiberium for the &quot;Tiberian&quot; series of games or ore or the more valuable gems for the &quot;Red Alert&quot; series) to a &quot;refinery&quot; structure. This in turn will convert the raw material into usable resources, expressed as credits. The raw materials themselves, in games released before &quot;Red Alert 2&quot; as well as &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 3&quot; require storage space in the form of refineries and, in the case of excess, &quot;storage silo&quot; structures. In &quot;Generals&quot; and &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, funds are collected by two methods: collection of supplies by specialised units and converted to money in &quot;supply centers&quot; or directly produced by specialised units, buildings, or tech buildings at a set interval of time.

All factions have structures and units with similar functions at their disposal. However, they are adjusted to fit each faction&#x27;s theme and have somewhat varying properties. Units can be classified into infantry, vehicles, and aircraft, each with their own subdivisions (note: in the &quot;Red Alert&quot; series there is also naval craft available). Unit effectiveness against opponents follows the rock-paper-scissors (intransitivity) principle found in most real-time strategy games, and units&#x27; attack characteristics can vary according to faction.

Virtually every type of structure in the series acts as a tech tree node, and additional units, structures and faction-specific abilities will become available as new structures are built and placed. Access to advanced units and abilities may be temporarily blocked if the required structures are destroyed or if they are not being provided with adequate power by the supporting &quot;power plant&quot; structures.

===Multiplayer===
Each &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; game has included the ability to play multiplayer games against other players. Each box of &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; contained two CD copies of the game, making multiplayer gaming possible with a single purchase of the game. Westwood Studios advertised this on the packaging with the slogan &quot;A second copy, so you and your friend can destroy each other.&quot; This resulted in &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; becoming the first RTS game title to feature competitive online play, and this is considered the most pertinent outside factor in the success of &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;. All games in the series up to &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2&quot; featured two CDs that could be used for this reason. Later games did not.

&quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3&quot; was noted for being the first RTS game to enable the campaigns to be played cooperatively online; others had only supported single player campaigns. However, it was only possible to connect to other computers through EA&#x27;s servers and not with LAN play.

Games produced by Westwood use the proprietary Westwood Online system to facilitate multiplayer games over the Internet; &quot;Renegade&quot; also supported GameSpy. Games under EA&#x27;s development continued to use GameSpy, but dropped support for Westwood Online in favor of using EA&#x27;s own servers. The GameSpy master servers have shut down in 2013, but some game titles can be played via Gameranger.

==Games==
===&quot;Tiberian&quot; series===
&quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;, released on September 26, 1995, is the first game in the series, which takes place sometime between 2017 and 2020, according to the &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade&quot; manual. It is considered the title which originally defined and popularized the real-time strategy genre. &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; introduced the warring factions of the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod. &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; was well received and was widely praised by critics: &quot;&quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; is one of the finest, most brilliantly-designed computer games I have ever seen&quot;, said &quot;GameSpot&quot; reviewer Chris Hudak. &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; has attained 94% as an aggregate score from Metacritic with the less well received &quot;Covert Operations&quot; expansion pack obtaining an aggregate score of 72% after its 1996 release.

&quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun&quot;, released on August 27, 1999, takes place in the year 2030. While the original &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;″s plot was centered around an allegorical world politics setting, &quot;Tiberian Sun&quot; shifted this to a more science fiction-like setting against the apocalyptic background of Tiberium beginning to assimilate vast portions of the Earth&#x27;s ecosystems. In 1998, Westwood Studios, the developers of &quot;Tiberian Sun&quot;, was acquired by Electronic Arts. However, EA had no direct part in the development of the title. Compared to its predecessor, &quot;Tiberian Sun&quot; relies heavily on science fiction technologies and introduces a new isometric game engine featuring varying level terrain to give the impression of a true 3D environment.

The full motion video is also scripted differently; while the cutscenes of &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; and &quot;Red Alert&quot; were filmed from a first-person perspective, &quot;Tiberian Sun&quot; used traditional cinematic shots for its FMVs featuring actors such as James Earl Jones and Michael Biehn.

&quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade&quot;, released February 26, 2002, takes place in the final days of the events of &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; and was the last &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; game to be created by Westwood Studios before their liquidation in 2003. Unlike any other games in the series, &quot;Renegade&quot; is a first-person shooter. Although receiving average reviews, with an aggregate score of 75% on both GameRankings and Metacritic, &quot;Renegade&quot; was praised for its online features. GameSpy awarded &quot;Renegade&quot; its 2002 &quot;Wish it had been better&quot; award, condemning the single player but saying that &quot;&quot;C&amp;C: Renegade&quot;″s multiplayer was innovative and fun&quot;. Online play was praised for encouraging teamwork and coordinated assaults, unlike other contemporary first-person shooters.

&quot;Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars&quot;, released March 29, 2007, was a return to the real-time strategy roots of the &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; series. As a direct sequel to &quot;Tiberian Sun&quot;, &quot;Tiberium Wars&quot; is set in 2047 and features the introduction of a third faction, the Scrin. The sequel attained an aggregate score of 85% from both GameRankings and Metacritic. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; U.S. gave the game its &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot; rating at 90%, stating that &quot;one of the greatest RTS franchises of all time returns to glory&quot;, while &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; gave it a more reserved rating of 82%, stating that it was &quot;a welcome, but limited, return&quot;.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Tiberium Wars&quot;, the expansion pack &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 3: Kane&#x27;s Wrath&quot; was announced. Released on March 24, 2008, &quot;Kane&#x27;s Wrath&quot; limited the player to only the Brotherhood of Nod in the campaign mode, though the original factions and six new sub-factions are available for the new strategic mode and skirmish mode and it takes place in 2052. Reception was mainly positive with the expansion attaining an aggregate score of 77%.

&quot;Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight&quot;, released on March 16, 2010, saw a big change in gameplay from the previous &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; by removing the resource gathering and base building elements in previous games as well as the removal of the third faction, the Scrin. It is a direct sequel to &quot;Kane&#x27;s Wrath&quot; (however not directly following on from its storyline), and is set in 2062, a time when Tiberium has advanced to its next evolutionary stage, and is rapidly spreading across Earth, making it soon to be uninhabitable.

&quot;Renegade X&quot;, is a free, fan-made remake of &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade&quot;. The developers received approval from EA to release their game, and it entered open beta on February 26, 2014. &quot;Renegade X&quot; includes a short single-player campaign called Black Dawn.

&quot;Command &amp; Conquer Remastered Collection&quot;. EA announced in November 2018 its plans to remaster &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;, including expansions and &quot;Red Alert&quot;, for modern computer systems through Petroglyph Games. It was released on June 5, 2020. &quot;The Remastered Collection&quot; received a score of 82/100 on Metacritic, with 48 positive, ten mixed and zero negative reviews, indicating a &quot;generally favorable&quot; reception. Along with the release, EA also released the source code to the mod libraries for the base game and &quot;Red Alert&quot; into open source as to allow players to build improved mods for the games.

===&quot;Red Alert&quot; series===
&quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert&quot;, released on November 22, 1996, is set in an alternate universe 1950s and was originally made to be the prequel to &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; establishing &quot;Red Alert&quot; as the prologue of the entire &quot;Tiberium&quot; series of games. Louis Castle has said that connecting &quot;Red Alert&quot; with the &quot;Tiberium&quot; series was a &quot;failed experiment&quot;. &quot;Red Alert&quot; introduces the Allies and the Soviets as rival factions roughly analogous to NATO and the Warsaw Pact of the Cold War. The game was received well by critics and has the highest average score of any &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; game with an average of over 90% from GameRankings and Metacritic, unlike the title&#x27;s two expansion packs, &quot;Red Alert: Counterstrike&quot; and &quot;Red Alert: The Aftermath&quot; of which both received below average reviews for the series with 63% and 70% average scores respectively. Both expansions gave the game more missions and more units. For PlayStation only, there was also a separate release to the original called &quot;Red Alert: Retaliation&quot; which included all the maps, missions and units of &quot;Red Alert: Counterstrike&quot; and &quot;Red Alert: The Aftermath&quot;, as well as some newly filmed cut-scenes only available with &quot;Red Alert: Retaliation&quot;. Before being re-released as freeware on August 31, 2008, by Electronic Arts &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert&quot; had sold over three million copies.

&quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2&quot; was released on October 23, 2000. It featured a Soviet invasion of North America with tanks, conscripts, large airships, and psychically dominated anti-ship giant squid. Since that game lacked reference to the &quot;Tiberian&quot; series, the connection established in the first &quot;Red Alert&quot; game became unclear. However, it has been implied by the original creators of the series, now working at Petroglyph Games, that &quot;Red Alert 2&quot; takes place in a parallel universe that came about as a result of time travel experiments taking place some time into the &quot;Tiberian&quot; series. &quot;Red Alert 2&quot; was received fairly positively with an aggregate score of 86% from GameRankings.

An expansion pack to &quot;Red Alert 2&quot;, &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Yuri&#x27;s Revenge&quot; was released on October 10, 2001. In &quot;Yuri&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, an ex-Soviet figure named Yuri, tries to conquer the world using psychic technology and his own private army. The expansion pack received mostly positive reviews. GameRankings reports an average score of 85% based on 31 reviews, making &quot;Yuri&#x27;s Revenge&quot; the best received expansion pack in the &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; series.

&quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3&quot;, released on October 28, 2008, followed up on the story of &quot;Red Alert 2&quot; and continued the series&#x27; more &quot;light-hearted&quot; take on &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;. It introduced many new comical units and the Empire of the Rising Sun faction, an anime inspired version of the Empire of Japan. Executive producer Chris Corry stated in a pre-release interview that &quot;Red Alert 3&quot; will further differentiate the playable factions from each other and &quot;[play] up the silliness in their faction design whenever possible&quot;. This approach was seen as popular with &quot;Red Alert 3&quot; obtaining an aggregate score of 82% from Metacritic. A stand-alone expansion to &quot;Red Alert 3&quot;, &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 – Uprising&quot; was released on March 12, 2009, to fairly poor reviews for the series with an average score of 64% from Metacritic. Another downloadable standalone game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 was released known as &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 - Commander&#x27;s Challenge&quot; which contained the Commander&#x27;s Challenge mode of Uprising for consoles.

&quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert&quot; was released on October 16, 2009, for iOS which was a continuation of the story of &quot;Red Alert 2&quot; and takes place before &quot;Red Alert 3&quot;. It contained two factions, the Allies and Soviet Union with a third faction, the Empire of the Rising Sun, to be added in its expansion pack. This version of the game is not available in some regions (e.g. the UK).

The Chinese developer Tencent made a new iOS version of &quot;Red Alert&quot;, with a highly mixed reception from fans online.

===&quot;Generals&quot; series===
&quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Generals&quot;, released on February 10, 2003, has a plotline which is unrelated to the other games of the &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; series. &quot;Generals&quot; is set in the near future and features the United States, China and the fictional terrorist organization, the Global Liberation Army. &quot;Generals&quot; uses an engine dubbed SAGE (or Strategy Action Game Engine) and is the first fully three-dimensional &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; real-time strategy game. After its release, &quot;Generals&quot; received mostly positive reviews. Based on 34 reviews, Metacritic gives it a score of 84/100 which includes a score of 9.3/10 from IGN. &quot;Generals&quot; has also received the E3 2002 Game Critics Awards Best Strategy Game award. One review noted that &quot;Generals&quot; was the first &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; real-time strategy game that did not include full-motion video cutscenes to tell the story and that it departed from the unique interface and base-building mechanics that had characterized all of the previous &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; RTS titles.

An expansion for &quot;Generals&quot;, &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Generals – Zero Hour&quot;, was released on September 22, 2003, to further the &quot;Generals&quot; storyline. &quot;Zero Hour&quot; added nine new armies to the game, over a dozen new campaign missions, and a gameplay mode known as Generals Challenge. Unlike &quot;Generals&quot;, &quot;Zero Hour&quot; featured the return of full motion videos to the series. &quot;Zero Hour&quot; obtained much the same reception as &quot;Generals&quot;, with an aggregate score of 85% and 84% from GameRankings and Metacritic respectively.

After EA Los Angeles started up their new internal group Danger Close and switched its focus to the &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; series, EA launched a new studio named Victory Games to continue the &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; franchise. On December 10, 2011, Electronic Arts posted that the next game in the series would be &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Generals 2&quot;. Three days later, a new browser-based, free-to-play MMO &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; game was also under development, under the name &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberium Alliances&quot;. On December 15, &quot;Tiberium Alliances&quot; began a closed beta.

In August 2012, &quot;Generals 2&quot; was repurposed to a free-to-play game known as simply &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;. The new game would have been based around the &quot;Generals&quot; franchise. However, following feedback from players who were able to play the alpha trial, the game was cancelled in October 2013. EA has said that the franchise will continue, but has given no other information at the time.

===2010s-present===
In October 2012, EA released &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: The Ultimate Collection&quot; on Origin; it includes every game in the series except &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Sole Survivor&quot;.

EA revealed &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Rivals&quot;, which was under development by the newly formed EA Redwood Studios and released for Android and iOS mobile devices in December 2018.

Petroglyph Games released remastered versions of &quot;Red Alert&quot; and &quot;Command and Conquer&quot; in June 2020, where both games have been updated with features that improve gameplay for players while also including all expansions initially released for the games. EA also released the source code for the remastered versions of &quot;Tiberian Dawn&quot; and &quot;Red Alert&quot;.

In March 2024, EA released &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: The Ultimate Collection&quot; on Steam, with newly added level editors in accordance to fan demand.

In February 2025, EA made the original source code for Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert, Generals, Zero Hour and Renegade open-source.

==Music==

Much of the music for the series was composed and produced by Westwood Studios&#x27; former sound director and video game music composer Frank Klepacki for the early games, with composition duties being taken on by several others following the liquidation of Westwood Studios in 2003. Klepacki returned to the series in 2008 to assist with the soundtrack for &quot;Red Alert 3&quot;.

The music has been received positively by critics, although praise was higher with earlier entries.

The original score for &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert&quot; was composed by Frank Klepacki and was voted the best video game soundtrack of 1996 by &quot;PC Gamer&quot; and &quot;Gameslice&quot; magazines. Among his most famous songs from the series is the theme of &quot;Red Alert&quot;, titled &quot;Hell March&quot;, which accents the style of the game with adrenalized riffs of electric guitar, the sounds of marching feet, and synthesizers to a dramatic chant. Originally intended to be the theme for the Brotherhood of Nod faction in the &quot;Covert Operations&quot; expansion to the original 1995 &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; game, the track eventually ended up enlisting itself as a staple in the &quot;Red Alert&quot; series instead, and a second version of &quot;Hell March&quot; was specifically created for &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2&quot;.

==Reception==
The &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; series have been a commercial success with over 30 million &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; games sold as of 2009. In 1997, &quot;Screen Digest&quot; said it was &quot;probably the world&#x27;s biggest PC CD-ROM entertainment franchise to date.&quot;

Games in the series have nearly consistently scored highly on video game review aggregator websites GameRankings and Metacritic, which collect data from numerous review websites. As noted in the table below, the highest rated game is &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; with a score of 94% from Metacritic. The highest rated game averaged over both sites is &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert&quot; with an average of just over 90%. As a series, &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; games have averaged approximately 80% when including expansion packs and approximately 84% without.

&quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;″s long history resulted in Guinness World Records awarding the series six world records in the Guinness World Records: Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2008. These records include &quot;Biggest Selling RTS Series&quot;, &quot;Most Number of Platforms for an RTS&quot;, and &quot;Longest Running Actor in Video Game Role&quot; for Joe Kucan, who has played the part of Kane, the villainous mastermind of the series, for 15 years.
