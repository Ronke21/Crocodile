<text>The fifth USS &quot;Truxtun&quot; (DLGN-35/CGN-35) was a nuclear powered cruiser in the U.S. Navy. She was launched as a destroyer leader (called a &quot;frigate&quot; at the time) and later reclassified as a cruiser. She was named after Commodore Thomas Truxtun (1755–1822). She was in service from May 1967 to September 1995.

==Class==
The USS &quot;Truxtun&quot; was a nuclear-powered single-ended guided-missile cruiser (her missile armament was installed only aft, unlike &quot;double-ended&quot; cruisers with missile armament installed both forward and aft), based on a heavily modified version of the . She was the only ship of her class. &quot;Truxtun&quot; was the third type of nuclear cruiser (all three were one-ship classes) to operate in the United States Navy, after and , and was powered by the same D2G reactors as &quot;Bainbridge&quot;. &quot;Truxtun&quot; was originally designated as a nuclear-powered guided-missile destroyer leader (DLGN), but in the 1975 cruiser realignment, she was reclassified as a nuclear-powered guided-missile cruiser (CGN).

Virtually identical to the &quot;Belknap&quot; class in weapons systems, &quot;Truxtun&quot; was powered by two D2G reactors rather than her sister class&#x27;s four 1,200 psi boilers. This resulted in &quot;Truxtun&quot; being larger overall: longer, greater across the beam, a draft, and a displacement of almost 1,200 more tons. The lessons learned on the &quot;Truxtun&quot; class were later adapted to the next nuclear classes, the and classes of nuclear-powered cruisers.

&quot;Truxtun&quot; was commissioned with a 5-inch/54-caliber Mark 42 gun on the foredeck and a twin-rail Mk 10 Missile Launcher on the quarterdeck, for the RIM-2 Terrier missile. The Terrier system was later upgraded to utilizing the RIM-67A Standard missiles in place of the less reliable Terrier missile. The missile depot was located under the helicopter deck and could store 40 RIM-67 Standard and 20 RUR-5 ASROC missiles. &quot;Truxtun&quot; initially used two single 3-inch/50-caliber guns, however in 1979 these were replaced with two Harpoon missile launchers. The ASW suite of &quot;Truxtun&quot; originally included the un-manned DASH, but in 1971 the hangar was upgraded to LAMPS Mk. I and the SH-2 Seasprite helicopter. While &quot;Truxtun&quot; was not upgraded via the NTU program, two Phalanx CIWS systems were installed, and new electronics were installed during overhaul and nuclear refuelling in the mid-1980s.

==Construction==
&quot;Truxtun&quot; was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden in New Jersey on 17 June 1963, launched on 19 December 1964 by Mrs. Kirby H. Tappan and Mrs. Scott Umsted, and commissioned on 27 May 1967. Originally planned to be a &quot;Belknap&quot;-class destroyer leader, she was extensively modified in her design to become the fourth nuclear-powered ship in the Navy, and she is considered to be her own class. At just over 8,500 tons full load, &quot;Truxtun&quot; is the smallest nuclear-powered surface vessel to have served in the US Navy.

==1960s==
&quot;Truxtun&quot; exited Camden on 3 June 1967 and headed for the West Coast. En route, she visited Yorktown, Virginia and Norfolk, Virginia; Guantánamo Bay, Cuba; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Mar del Plata, Argentina. &quot;Truxtun&quot; rounded Cape Horn on 10 July and entered the Pacific Ocean. After port calls at Valparaíso, Chile, and Mazatlán, Mexico, &quot;Truxtun&quot; reached Long Beach, California, her home port, on 29 July. After conducting trials there in late summer and early fall, she commenced shakedown training in November. She interrupted shakedown twice: on 10 and 11 November for Operation &quot;Bell Anchor&quot; and again from 27 November to 3 December for Exercise &quot;Blue Lotus.&quot;

The nuclear-powered warship completed her shakedown training and, on 2 January 1968, got underway for the Western Pacific. She made an overnight stop at Pearl Harbor on 7/8 January and arrived in Sasebo, Japan, on 19 January. Five days later, &quot;Truxtun&quot; and the aircraft carrier departed Sasebo and headed for the Sea of Japan in response to North Korea&#x27;s seizure of the American ship . She operated in the Sea of Japan until 16 February when she headed south for her first line period off the coast of Vietnam. After an overnight stop at Subic Bay on 19–20 February, &quot;Truxtun&quot; set a course for &quot;Yankee Station&quot; in the Gulf of Tonkin. &quot;Truxtun&quot; spent the majority of the remainder of her deployment in the Far East operating off the coast of Vietnam. While in the combat zone, she conducted search and rescue (SAR) missions, stood guard against North Vietnamese air attacks as a positive identification radar zone (PIRAZ) picket ship, and served as plane-guard ship for carriers &quot;Enterprise&quot;, , and . &quot;Truxtun&quot; punctuated her line periods with calls at Singapore, Hong Kong, Danang, and Subic Bay. She departed Subic Bay on 6 July, steamed east toward the United States, and reentered Long Beach on 19 July.

For the next four months, the warship operated along the U.S. West Coast. She acted as plane guard for , , &quot;Enterprise&quot; and while those carriers conducted landing qualifications for pilots. In mid-November, &quot;Truxtun&quot; became an antisubmarine warfare (ASW) school ship, and she hosted training student sailors in the techniques of hunting submarines. Early in December, &quot;Truxtun&quot; returned to Long Beach to prepare for overhaul. In January 1969, she shifted to Bremerton, Washington, where she entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for refurbishing which lasted until April. The cruiser then resumed operations along the West Coast which continued until 23 September when she got underway for her second deployment with the 7th Fleet.

After a stop at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Truxtun&quot; arrived at Subic Bay on 20 October 1969. Again, she spent much of her deployment cruising along the coast of embattled Vietnam, taking time periodically to make port calls at Hong Kong, Singapore, and Subic Bay. However, in addition to acting as plane guard for carriers and standing duty as PIRAZ and a search and rescue ship, she also served as a peacetime aerial reconnaissance protective (PAPRO) picket in the Sea of Japan and participated in the Taiwan Strait patrol. Just before departing from the Far East, she conducted exercises in the vicinity of Okinawa and then made her final port visit at Sasebo, Japan, from 6 to 11 March 1970.

&quot;Truxtun&quot; was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for superior performance during her deployment.

==1970s==
&quot;Truxtun&quot; returned to Long Beach on 23 March and launched into a round of inspections and training cruises. In June, the warship embarked 40 NROTC midshipmen for their summer training cruise. During the first part of the cruise, she fired missiles on the Pacific missile range and visited San Francisco and Seattle. On 13 July, she departed Seattle for Pearl Harbor to conduct the second part of the training cruise. On 29 July, &quot;Truxtun&quot; returned to Long Beach from Hawaii, disembarked the midshipmen, and resumed normal operations. For the remainder of the summer, she conducted exercises and underwent various inspections. From 16 to 25 October, she moored alongside for a tender availability. Following one more period of exercises at sea late in October, she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard in preparation for a three-month restricted availability which began on 2 November 1970.

&quot;Truxtun&quot;″s yard work was completed in mid-January, she then conducted type training and ASW exercises before preparing to deploy to the western Pacific once more. She returned to Long Beach on 22 January 1971 and remained there until 2 February when she got underway for Pearl Harbor. After a two-day layover in Hawaii, she resumed her voyage to the Far East on 9 February and reached Subic Bay on 20 February. During that deployment, &quot;Truxtun&quot; returned to her familiar routine along the coast of Vietnam, standing PIRAZ picket duty and conducting exercises and tests. She visited Yokosuka, Japan, several times and made single stops at Hong Kong and Sattahip, Thailand. In late April, she also patrolled the Taiwan Strait for two days.

On 6 July, she completed her final line period of the deployment and left the Gulf of Tonkin. After a visit to Subic Bay, she set a course, on 10 July, for Fremantle, Australia, where she spent a week. Following port calls at Pago Pago, Samoa, and Pearl Harbor, she moored at Long Beach on 17 August and began post-deployment stand-down. Through the end of September, &quot;Truxtun&quot; received visitors on board and conducted drills to improve and to test her missile and gunnery marksmanship. During the first week in October, a Board of Inspection and Survey inspected &quot;Truxtun&quot;; and, on 8 October, she began a restricted availability during which she was modified to utilize the Light Airborne Multi-purpose System (LAMPS). From 18 November to 9 December, the ship conducted post-availability dock trials and type training as well as testing the newly installed LAMPS system. On 14 December 1971, a team from Naval Air Systems Command inspected and certified &quot;Truxtun&quot;″s LAMPS installation.

During the first six months of 1972, &quot;Truxtun&quot; operated out of her home port in North American coastal waters. She conducted exercises, entertained visitors, and underwent several inspections. Following another restricted availability in June, she spent July preparing for her fourth tour of duty with the U.S. Seventh Fleet.

On 13 July, she departed Long Beach with , bound for the western Pacific and for her most eventful series of line periods off Vietnam. She parted company from &quot;Canterbury&quot; on 18 July and put into Pearl Harbor the following day. On 23 July, &quot;Truxtun&quot; resumed her voyage to the Orient and moored at Subic Bay on 4 August. Four days later, she loaded ammunition and got underway for her first line period in the Gulf of Tonkin. Over the next five months, &quot;Truxtun&quot; stood both SAR and PIRAZ picket duty. During these assignments, she evaded at least three typhoons. Her busiest week came between 8 and 15 October, when she directed fighter intercepts resulting in six MiG kills, three of which occurred on 15 October alone. By the end of her deployment, &quot;Truxtun&quot; was credited with directing fighter intercepts which resulted in the destruction of eleven North Vietnamese MiGs and rescue of three downed American pilots, earning the ship her second Navy Unit Commendation.

In October, November, and January, &quot;Truxtun&quot; briefly joined the Taiwan Strait patrol. She also made port calls at Sasebo, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Yokosuka. On 21 January 1973, relieved her on the north SAR station, and &quot;Truxtun&quot; headed, via the Taiwan Strait, for Japan. She stopped at Yokosuka from 26 to 30 January before continuing on, via Pearl Harbor, to Long Beach, where she arrived on Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday.

Post-deployment stand-down took up the ensuing month. On 19 March, she moored alongside and commenced a tender availability which lasted until late April. &quot;Truxtun&quot; then resumed operations in and out of Long Beach. In May, she conducted type training off the California coast and naval gunfire support qualifications at San Clemente Island. On 7 June, the warship began embarking Naval Academy and NROTC midshipmen for their summer cruise. For the next two months, she trained the midshipmen, carrying them to ports along the west coast as well as to Hawaii.

She debarked the midshipmen on 27 July and began preparations for her fifth deployment to the Far East. On 17 August, &quot;Truxtun&quot; got underway from Long Beach, bound for the western Pacific. En route, she stopped at Pearl Harbor and reached Subic Bay on 5 September. She punctuated relatively uneventful tours of duty on PIRAZ station in the Gulf of Tonkin with port visits to Sattahip, Singapore, and Manila. &quot;Truxtun&quot; also conducted missile exercises and ASW drills. On 9 December, she stood out of Subic Bay, sifted through the San Bernardino Strait, and headed for home. On Christmas Eve 1973, &quot;Truxtun&quot; moored at Long Beach and began preparations for her first complex overhaul.

On 25 January 1974, &quot;Truxtun&quot; cleared Long Beach for Bremerton, Washington. Four days later, she entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. There, the warship began a major 18-month overhaul during which her nuclear reactors were &quot;refueled.&quot; On 30 June 1975, near the end of that repair period, &quot;Truxtun&quot; was reclassified a nuclear-powered guided-missile cruiser and was redesignated CGN-35. On 31 July, she completed the overhaul and all attendant tests and trials and sailed for San Diego. She arrived in her new home port on 4 August and resumed normal operations in the southern California area. That schedule occupied her for the following 12 months.

On 30 July 1976, the guided-missile cruiser headed out of San Diego, bound for the western Pacific. After two weeks of training in the Hawaiian Islands, she continued her voyage west on 16 August; and, after a somewhat circuitous cruise that took her to Wellington in New Zealand and Melbourne in Australia, &quot;Truxtun&quot; arrived in Subic Bay on 25 September. She conducted operations in the Philippines for about a month and then departed Subic Bay on 28 October, bound for the Indian Ocean and participation in Operation &quot;Midlink 76.&quot; She arrived in Karachi, Pakistan, on 9 November for three days of briefings in preparation for the exercise. From 13 to 21 November, the warship joined in the multinational exercise in the waters off the coast of Pakistan. She returned to Karachi at the conclusion of &quot;Midlink&quot; on the 21st and remained there until the 24th at which time she headed back to Subic Bay. Local operations in the Philippines occupied the remainder of the year. From 4 to 13 January 1977, &quot;Truxtun&quot; made a round-trip voyage to Hong Kong and back. She completed READEX 1–77 between 15 and 21 January and then again headed for the Indian Ocean in company with &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the cruiser . En route, she and her travelling companions conducted exercise &quot;Merlion III&quot; with units of the Singapore Armed Forces on 25 January. &quot;Truxtun&quot; participated in Operation &quot;Houdini&quot; in mid-February and visited Port Victoria in the Seychelle Islands. She returned to Subic Bay on 13 March and, four days later, got underway for the United States.

After an 11-day non-stop voyage, she reentered San Diego on 28 March. The guided-missile cruiser conducted a four-week restricted availability and then resumed operations along the California coast. For six months, the warship conducted routine independent ship&#x27;s exercises, gunnery drills, and antisubmarine warfare training. She spent the month of November at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard undergoing repairs to her nuclear power plant and returned to San Diego on 4 December. For the remaining three weeks of 1977, &quot;Truxtun&quot; operated out of her home port.

The first three months of 1978 were spent in operations off the west coast in preparation for &quot;Truxtun&quot;″s forthcoming deployment to the western Pacific. The ship departed San Diego on 4 April and spent the next six months in operations with the 7th Fleet which took her as far west as the Arabian Sea and as far south as Perth, Australia. During this cruise she also visited Colombo, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Pusan, South Korea. &quot;Truxtun&quot; returned to San Diego on 27 October. Local operations out of San Diego, following post-deployment stand-down, concluded the year.
1979 &#x27;Truxtun&#x27; departed San Diego, a brief stop at Seal Beach to unload ammo, then on to Bremerton. This time in Puget Sound Naval Shipyards, the 3&quot; guns amidships were removed and the Harpoon system installed. While being serviced in a floating drydock, extreme diligence was done keeping her screws covered and away from prying eyes.

==1980s and 1990s==
On 26 February 1980, &quot;Truxtun&quot; departed San Diego, CA for her eighth WESTPAC (western Pacific) deployment, this time as part of the &quot;USS Constellation&quot; Battle Group. In command was CAPTAIN E.M. Baldwin, USN. &quot;Truxtun&quot; participated in RIMPAC 1980, a large multi-national Naval exercise near the Hawaiian Islands in March 1980. After a brief stopover in Pearl Harbor, &quot;Truxtun&quot; continued westward, arriving at the US Naval Shipyard in Subic Bay, Philippine Islands for a brief maintenance period. Following this inport period, &quot;Truxtun&quot; continued into the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean, eventually serving for an extended period of time during the Iranian Hostage Crisis. Toward the end of this deployment, which was extended due to operational requirements, &quot;Truxtun&quot; also made port calls in Subic Bay, Philippines, Pattaya Beach, Thailand and Wellington, New Zealand. On 15 October 1980, the cruiser returned to its homeport of San Diego. Anti-nuclear protest boats greeted &quot;Truxtun&quot; at Wellington in 1976, 1980 and 1982.

On 20 October 1981, &quot;Truxtun&quot; got underway from San Diego, CA for her ninth WESTPAC deployment. Inport periods again included Pearl Harbor and Subic Bay en route to the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and the South Pacific. Much of the time &quot;Truxtun&quot; spent on underway operations during this deployment was in the Indian Ocean. Port calls included Mombasa, Kenya, Perth, Western Australia, Diego Garcia (BIOT), Brisbane, Queensland Australia, Hobart, Tasmania Australia, Nuku&#x27;Alofa, Kingdom of Tonga, and Wellington, New Zealand. On 12 June 1982, &quot;Truxtun&quot; returned to her homeport of San Diego to begin preparations for her upcoming Complex Overhaul (COH) in Washington State.

From September 1982 to July 1984 &quot;Truxtun&quot; underwent her final complex overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard which included upgrading the combat system suite to its final configuration.

On 15 January 1986 &quot;Truxtun&quot; left on her tenth WESTPAC, this time serving as the Anti-Air Warfare Commander for Battle Group FOXTROT. In April, because of increased tension in Libya and the Gulf of Sidra, &quot;Truxtun&quot; was diverted to the Mediterranean along with &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the cruiser . After almost two months of operations in the Mediterranean, the three nuclear-powered ships were directed home by way of Gibraltar, the Cape of Good Hope, Western Australia, the Philippines and Hawaii. By the end of the seven-month deployment the all nuclear group had steamed over 65,000 miles and operated in all four numbered U.S. Fleets.

On 26 October 1987, &quot;Truxtun&quot; deployed with Battle Group FOXTROT on her first Northern Pacific deployment and participated in one of the largest Surface Action Group exercises ever massed. &quot;Truxtun&quot; again deployed with Battle Group FOXTROT on 5 January 1988 for her 11th Western Pacific-Middle East deployment. &quot;Truxtun&quot; also participated in Operation Praying Mantis. This cruise earned &quot;Truxtun&quot; the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and her second Meritorious Unit Commendation. Upon return from deployment, &quot;Truxtun&quot; spent 9 months in Puget Sound Naval Shipyard undergoing a Drydocking Selective Restricted Availability. On 1 October 1989 &quot;Truxtun&quot;&#x27;s homeport was shifted to Bremerton, Washington.

On 1 February 1990, &quot;Truxtun&quot; deployed with the aircraft carrier in Battle Group Charlie. The Battle Group participated in TEAM SPIRIT 1990 with U.S. Marines and forces from the Republic of Korea. &quot;Truxtun&quot;, along with Battle Group Charlie, then proceeded to the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea, where &quot;Truxtun&quot; was tasked with escort duty in support of Operation Earnest Will, where she escorted several re-flagged Kuwaiti oil tankers through the Straits of Hormuz and the waters of the Persian Gulf. These duties earned &quot;Truxtun&quot; her second Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. During much of this deployment, &quot;Truxtun&quot; served as Anti Air Warfare Commander, Electronic Warfare Commander and as the AAW Picket for Battle Group Charlie. &quot;Truxtun&quot; also spent a considerable amount of time steaming independently of the battle group conducting various operations and tasks, including a freedom of movement exercise through the Maldives. Port calls included Pearl Harbor Hawaii; Pusan, Korea; Subic Bay, Philippines; Singapore; Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory; Perth, Australia and Hong Kong. &quot;Truxtun&quot; returned from her 12th WESTPAC to her new home port of Bremerton Washington. Although Truxtun&#x27;s home port was changed in October of the previous year, &quot;Truxtun&quot; kept port in San Diego, California while continuing work-ups for this deployment.

&quot;Truxtun&quot; departed Bremerton for her 13th WESTPAC and a Middle East deployment on 16 August 1991. &quot;Truxtun&quot; performed duties as the Persian Gulf Anti-Air Warfare Commander, Force Track Coordinator, Electronic Warfare Commander and alternate Anti-Surface Warfare Commander during Operation Desert Storm. &quot;Truxtun&quot; also served as the Commander, United States Mine Counter-Measure Group One flagship during minesweeping operations off the coastal waters of Kuwait. During her time in the Gulf, she spent most of her time guarding the &#x27;sweeps,&#x27; wooden mine sweepers deployed to search for water-borne mines in the Gulf. Later during the same cruise while in the Gulf of Oman, &quot;Truxtun&quot; was tasked with escorting re-flagged Kuwaiti oil tankers in Operation Earnest Will.

After a short upkeep period in Bremerton, &quot;Truxtun&quot; began a two-month Counter-Narcotic mini-deployment off the coasts of Mexico and Central America, which ended in June 1992. The ship went 42 days completely unsupported by any other ship. It found no vessels moving narcotics.

From 12 February 1993 to 1 August 1993, &quot;Truxtun&quot; was underway for her 14th and final WESTPAC. On 19 February she began a high speed independent transit from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii to Melbourne, Australia covering 7,180 miles in 11 days at an average speed of 25 knots. On 21 March &quot;Truxtun&quot; rendezvoused with the Battle Group in the Indian Ocean and transited the Strait of Hormuz. While operating in the Gulf &quot;Truxtun&quot; conducted several multi-national force exercises including operations with the Kuwaiti Air Force. On 22 April &quot;Truxtun&quot; was detached from Battle Group operations and proceeded to the Red Sea to enforce United Nations Security Council sanctions against Iraq by boarding vessels bound for the Jordanian port of Aqaba. Utilizing two teams, &quot;Truxtun&quot; queried 126 merchant vessels, boarded 73 and diverted seven ships.

In 1994 &quot;Truxtun&quot; was the platform of choice for a variety of missions which included participation as opposition forces for fleet exercises, providing naval gunfire support spotter services and being Deck Landing Qualification platform for LAMPS helicopters. &quot;Truxtun&quot; also served as the escort ship for who towed a defueled nuclear submarine. She participated in two Chief of Naval Operations projects off the coast of San Francisco and conducted shipboard training at every opportunity. From 23 May to 17 June, &quot;Truxtun&quot; served as Coalition Forces flagship for CTF 331 during the highly successful RIMPAC 94 multi-national exercise.

On 18 August 1994 &quot;Truxtun&quot; departed Bremerton on her final operational commitment. Originally assigned to escort the tow ships for two defueled nuclear submarines from Rodman, Panama to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, the orders were changed on short notice and &quot;Truxtun&quot; chopped (change of operational control) to Commander, Joint Task Force Four to conduct Counter-Narcotic operations for a second tour in the War on Drugs. On 3 September &quot;Truxtun&quot; transited the Panama Canal for the first time in her history and began patrolling the Caribbean Sea.

On 14 October 1994 and purely by a twist of historical coincidence, &quot;Truxtun&quot; sailed the same waters in the southern Caribbean Sea where , under the command of Commodore Truxtun, had dueled with &quot;La Vengeance&quot; almost 200 years earlier.

==Fate==
&quot;Truxtun&quot; was decommissioned on 11 September 1995 and was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. She has been disposed of by Ship recycling, 16 April 1999.

&quot;Truxtun&quot; was awarded seven battle stars and the Navy Unit Commendation for service in the Vietnam War.

<doc id="209715" wikidata="Q772637" url="?curid=209715" title="Vang Pao">
<text>Vang Pao (RPA: &quot;Vaj Pov&quot; , Lao: ວັງປາວ; 8 December 1929 – 6 January 2011) was a major general in the Royal Lao Army and later a leader of the Hmong American community in the United States.

==Early life==
Vang, an ethnic Hmong, was born on 8 December 1929, in a Hmong village named Nonghet, located in Central Xiangkhuang Province, in the northeastern region of Laos, where his father, Neng Chu Vang, was a county leader.

Vang began his early life as a farmer until Japanese forces invaded and occupied French Indochina in World War II. His father sent him away to school from the age of 10 to 15 before he launched his military career, joining the French military to protect fellow Hmong during the Japanese invasion.

While taking an entrance examination, the captain who was the proctor realized that Vang knew almost no written French. The captain dictated the answers to Vang so he could join the army. Anne Fadiman, author of &quot;The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down&quot;, said Vang did not express any embarrassment over this cheating. Fadiman added &quot;it is worth noting that in this incident, far from tarnishing Vang Pao&#x27;s reputation — as, for example Ted Kennedy&#x27;s fudged Spanish exam at Harvard University tarnished his — merely added to his mythology: this was the sort of man who could never be held back by such petty impediments as rules.&quot;

==Military career==
The term &quot;Mèo Maquis&quot; was originally used by Free French and Allied intelligence officers to describe the Hmong resistance forces working against Japanese forces occupying Indochina and China during World War II. The name was in reference to the Maquis resistance in France, with &quot;Mèo&quot; being the then-current exonym for the Hmong. After World War II, French Groupement de Commandos Mixtes Aéroportés (GCMA) authorities recruited Vang as a lieutenant during the First Indochina War to combat the Viet Minh.

He was the only ethnic Hmong to attain the rank of General officer in the Royal Lao Army, and he was loyal to the King of Laos while remaining a champion of the Hmong people. During the 1960s/70s, he commanded the Secret Army, also known as the Hmong Army, a highly-effective Central Intelligence Agency-trained and supported force that fought against the Pathet Lao and People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam. Vang&#x27;s ethnic Hmong and Laotian veterans and their refugee families who served in the U.S. &quot;Secret Army&quot; were eventually granted the status of political refugees by the United Nations because of alleged persecution by the Lao Marxist government and communist Vietnam who took control in 1975. The Lao and Hmong refugees were allowed to resettle in the United States, France, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere. Many of Vang&#x27;s former veterans formed the Lao Veterans of America, Inc. and the Lao Veterans of America Institute, with offices in Fresno, California, Washington, D.C. and other locales.

==Immigration to the United States==
Vang emigrated to the United States after the communists seized power in Laos in 1975. He and his wife, May Song Vang, whom he married in 1973, initially moved to Montana before settling in California. He remained widely respected by his fellow Hmong and was an esteemed elder of the American Hmong people, many of whom experienced the war or the reprisals that followed. Though he was less influential among younger Hmong-Americans who had primarily grown up in the United States, he was considered an influential leader of U.S. Hmong community, enjoying great loyalty for his position of leadership and respect for his military accomplishments.

While in exile, Vang assembled other Lao and Hmong leaders from around the world to create the United Lao National Liberation Front (ULNF), also known as the Lao National Liberation Movement or simply the Neo Hom, to bring attention to atrocities happening in Laos and to support the political and military resistance to the government of the Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic. He was one of the eight founders of the organization in 1981, along with Prince Sisouk na Champassak, General Phoumi Nosavan and General Kouprasith Abhay.

Thousands of Vang&#x27;s former ethnic Laotian and Hmong veterans, and their refugee families, in the United States also formed the non-profit veterans and advocacy organizations the Lao Veterans of America and the Lao Veterans of America Institute. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Vang, aided by his adviser, Philip Smith, and influential American diplomatic allies, Members of Congress, and vast numbers of Hmong-Americans, helped halt the forced United Nations-sponsored repatriation back to Laos of thousands of Laotian and Hmong refugees in Thailand. It was a major human rights victory for the Hmong and Lao community and non-profit advocacy organizations who urged an end to forced repatriation, including the Center for Public Policy Analysis (CPPA) and the Lao Veterans of America.

Throughout Vang&#x27;s residence in the U.S., the Hmong leader diplomatically opposed human rights violations by the communist government of Laos against the Hmong and Laotian people. He was invited to speak at the U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos, with Members of Congress, about the persecution of the Laotian and Hmong people on several occasions in the U.S. Congress from 1999 to 2003.

From 1993 to 2003, Vang relied on Philip Smith for much of his efforts with policymakers in Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Congress. Smith was a long-time friend of Vang Pao and many Laotian and Hmong American community leaders. Over time, Smith was instrumental in helping Vang to meet with key Members of Congress and senior Administration officials as well as helping to organize Congressional hearings, briefings and research missions to South East Asia. (Smith, a foreign policy, human rights and legislative affairs specialist, serves as the Executive Director of the Center for Public Policy Analysis.)

In March 2011, following Vang Pao&#x27;s death, Smith wrote an editorial critical of the decision to not allow him to be interred in Arlington National Cemetery. Smith persisted in his efforts and the CPPA, along with the Lao Veterans of America, helped organize national veterans ceremonies in May 2011 to officially honor Vang Pao at Arlington National Cemetery.

In late November 2003 and early 2004, Vang shocked many of his closest advisers and supporters, and began to mysteriously, and abruptly, reverse his previous position in opposition to U.S. economic sanctions against the communist government of Laos. Vang, in close cooperation with one of his highly controversial sons, Cha Vang, reversed his long-standing position and began to publicly advocate normalization of U.S.-Laotian trade relations with Laos in a highly controversial move that involved secret meetings with communist Vietnamese military and political officials and complex and questionable financial dealings involving Cha Vang and others. This created suspicion and distrust among many of Pao&#x27;s supporters and advisers who quickly began to abandon Vang Pao and his new direction in support of the Lao government&#x27;s foreign policy, economic and military agenda. The Lao Marxist government, and hardline Pathet Lao elements in the Lao military and government, backed by the military in Vietnam, continued to engage in military attacks and human rights violations against the Hmong in Laos.

Many of Vang&#x27;s former veterans and their families, whose relatives were still being persecuted and killed in Laos, opposed Vang&#x27;s change of stance on the issue of Normalized Trade Relations (NTR), or Most Favored Nation Trade Status (MFN), with Laos. This included the Lao Veterans of America, the Center for Public Policy Analysis and others. Following Pao&#x27;s meeting with communist generals and officials from Vietnam, Vang&#x27;s so-called &quot;New Doctrine&quot; was widely opposed by many of his closest advisers, family, supporters, and former veterans, and many in the Lao and Hmong-American community. By 2004–05, independent journalists investigating complex financial relations, ethics probes, and scandals surrounding Cha Vang and various lawsuits. Central in the controversy, scandals, and lawsuits, including one by the Minnesota Attorney General, was Cha Vang&#x27;s role with the Vang Pao Foundation, a funeral home, a chamber of commerce in St. Paul, and other financial and political dealings. The &quot;Minnesota Star Tribune&quot; and &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; reported extensively on these matters.

The Vang Pao Foundation was forced to close following investigation by authorities and a lawsuit by the attorney general of Minnesota.

Thailand-based Laotian and Hmong refugees, many of whom had been living at formal and informal refugee camps including Wat Tham Krabok, a Buddhist temple in Thailand, were afforded the right to avoid the forced return to Laos and instead over 15,000 were offered relocation rights and assistance to the U.S. in 2004 and 2005.

==Coup d&#x27;état conspiracy==

On 4 June 2007, following a lengthy federal investigation labeled &quot;Operation Tarnished Eagle&quot;, warrants were issued by U.S. federal courts ordering the arrest of Vang Pao and nine others for allegedly plotting to overthrow the Pathet Lao communist government of Laos, in violation of the federal Neutrality Acts. Following the issuance of the warrants, an estimated 250 federal agents representing numerous U.S. federal law enforcement and other agencies conducted simultaneous raids on homes, offices and other locations throughout central and southern California, arresting Vang and nine other individuals. The federal charges alleged that members of the group inspected weapons, including AK-47s, smoke grenades, and Stinger missiles, with the intent of purchasing them and smuggling them into Thailand, where they allegedly would be shipped to anti-Laotian governmental resistance movement forces inside Laos. The one non-Hmong person among the nine arrested, Harrison Jack, a 1968 West Point graduate and retired Army infantry officer, allegedly attempted to recruit Special Operations veterans to act as mercenaries in an invasion of Laos.

On 15 June 2007, defendants were indicted by a grand jury and an 11th man was arrested in connection with the alleged plot. The defendants faced possible life terms for violation of the U.S. Neutrality Act and various weapons charges. Vang and the other Hmong were initially denied bail by the California federal court, which cited each of them as a flight risk. Since the 4 June 2007 federal raid, the arrests became the subject of mounting criticism. His fellow friends, including Hmong, Mienh, Lao, Vietnamese, and Americans individuals who knew Vang protested the arrests, rallying in California, Minnesota, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin. Several of Vang&#x27;s high-level U.S. supporters criticized the California court that issued the arrest warrants. In 2009 all of the federal charges against Vang Pao were dropped.

Prior to his arrest, Vang was scheduled to have an elementary school in Madison, Wisconsin named after him, a proposal that met with opposition over historian Alfred W. McCoy&#x27;s allegations that Vang had been involved in war crimes and drug trafficking, with Hmong scholars Gary Yia Lee and Jane Hamilton-Merritt, as well as former Air America Association president Jack Knott, strongly disputing his claims. Pao&#x27;s June 2007 arrest later led the Madison School to reopen discussion on the school&#x27;s naming. On 18 June 2007, the Madison Metropolitan School District Board of Education voted to drop Vang&#x27;s name from the new school, in light of the federal charges against him and the previous allegations. Nonetheless, in 2012 another school district, the Fresno Unified School District, voted unanimously to name a new elementary school after him the year after his passing.

===Release from jail===
On 12 July 2007, the California federal court ordered the release of the Hmong leader on a US$1.5 million bond secured by property owned by members of his family. Many Hmong had participated in numerous protests over several weeks in California and elsewhere, calling for Pao&#x27;s release from the date of his incarceration until his release under bail nearly a month later.

===Return to court===
On 9 March 2009, Vang&#x27;s lawyers filed a motion seeking to dismiss the charges against him. His lawyers claimed that the charges were fabricated and had no bearing in court. Following this appearance, on 6 April 2009, federal prosecutors denied all allegations of fabrications in the motion. That following month, on 11 May 2009, Vang Pao returned to federal court in Sacramento, California with his lawyers to argue the motion. Judge Frank Damrell stated, after hearing the arguments for the motion, that there was insufficient evidence from the defense to justify a dismissal.

===Dropping of charges ===
On 18 September 2009, the federal government dropped all charges against Vang Pao, announcing in a release that the federal government was permitted to consider &quot;the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted.&quot; Vang Pao&#x27;s long-time adviser and friend Philip Smith hailed the federal government&#x27;s decision to drop the charges against Vang and the other accused Hmong-American defendants. Following Vang&#x27;s arrest, Smith advocated in Washington, D.C. for the case to be dropped against Vang and other Hmong leaders. Smith raised repeated public concerns that the U.S. Justice Department and U.S. Department of States, would be putting themselves and the U.S. government on trial, for its betrayal and abandonment of the Hmong people during the conclusion of the Vietnam War and its aftermath when many Hmong were killed or imprisoned by the Lao communist government that prevailed in the conflict.

At special sessions of the U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos, Smith and the Center for Public Policy Analysis joined by Members of Congress, including U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher, and others, called on the U.S. Department of Justice to immediately drop the case, and the charges, against General Vang and the other Hmong defendants, especially in light of the Lao government&#x27;s and Lao Peoples Army&#x27;s (LPA) ongoing military attacks and egregious human rights violations directed against many of the Laotian and Hmong people, which included attacks on unarmed civilians and political and religious dissidents, atrocities, rape, torture and the use of mass starvation.

Amnesty International and other human rights organizations and experts testified about their research efforts, along with Members of Congress, including U.S. Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy, U.S. Senator Norm Coleman, at the special Congressional Forums on Laos held in the U.S. Congress and Library of Congress.

==Personal life==
Vang Pao reportedly had at least 25 children by several wives, and spoke English, French, and Hmong besides his native Lao, although in later years in interviews he did not seem to use the language as much anymore.
Diana Aguilera of the &quot;Fresno Bee&quot; wrote that May Song Vang, who was Vang Pao&#x27;s wife at the time of his death, &quot;became the face of the Hmong community&quot; after Vang Pao died.

==Death==
Vang, who battled diabetes and heart disease, died at age 81 from pneumonia with cardiac complications on 6 January 2011, at Clovis Community Medical Center, in Clovis, California. He was admitted to the hospital on 26 December 2010, after attending Hmong New Year celebrations in Fresno. A hospital spokesman said his family was at the hospital at the time of Vang&#x27;s death.

Traditional Hmong funeral services for Vang were scheduled to be held for six days, starting 4 February 2011, at the Fresno Convention Center. More than 10,000 Hmong mourned on the first day of the funeral. After several funeral days, it was estimated that over 40,000 attended during the service of his funeral A committee unanimously voted against a request to bury Vang Pao at Arlington National Cemetery; he was subsequently buried near Los Angeles at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Legacy==
In March 2011, following Vang&#x27;s death, the CPPA issued an editorial, published in the &quot;Minneapolis Star Tribune&quot;, critical of the decision by the U.S. Secretary of the Army not permitting Vang&#x27;s burial in Arlington National Cemetery. Despite the U.S. Secretary of the Army&#x27;s unpopular and widely criticized decision, the CPPA, along with the Lao Veterans of America Institute, Lao Veterans of America, Inc. (LVA), and others helped to organize national veterans ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery in May 2011 to honor Vang&#x27;s contribution to U.S. national security efforts during the Vietnam War. The Lao Veterans of America, Philip Smith, the CPPA and other prominent figures also highlighted and lauded Vang Pao&#x27;s contribution to U.S. national security interests during the Vietnam War.

In May 2011, Vang&#x27;s efforts during the Vietnam War were officially commemorated at memorial ceremonies in Arlington National Cemetery organized by the Lao Veterans of America Institute, LVA, the CPPA, the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Special Forces Association, and others. Participants at the special ceremony held at the Laos Memorial within Arlington National Cemetery included the CPPA, LVA, U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of the Army, Members of the Congress, U.S. Special Forces Association, Counterparts Veterans Association and others. General Vang&#x27;s son, Chong Vang, spoke at the ceremony along with Colonel Wangyee Vang, Philip Smith, Captain D.L. &quot;Pappy Hicks&quot;, U.S. Special Forces Association, and others.

Vang&#x27;s likeness is memorialized by numerous monuments across the United States, including statues at the San Joaquin County Fairground in Stockton, California and outside the City Council Chamber in Chico, California.

<text>Madrasa (, , ; Arabic: مدرسة , pl. , ), sometimes transliterated as madrasah or madrassa, is the Arabic word for any type of educational institution, secular or religious (of any religion), whether for elementary education or higher learning. In countries outside the Arab world, the word usually refers to a specific type of religious school or college for the study of the religion of Islam (loosely equivalent to a Christian seminary), though this may not be the only subject studied. 

In an architectural and historical context, the term generally refers to a particular kind of institution in the historic Muslim world which primarily taught Islamic law and jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;), as well as other subjects on occasion. The origin of this type of institution is widely credited to Nizam al-Mulk, a vizier under the Seljuks in the 11th century, who was responsible for building the first network of official madrasas in Iran, Mesopotamia, and Khorasan. From there, the construction of madrasas spread across much of the Muslim world over the next few centuries, often adopting similar models of architectural design.

The madrasas became the longest serving institutions of the Ottoman Empire, beginning service in 1330 and operating for nearly 600 years on three continents. They trained doctors, engineers, lawyers and religious officials, among other members of the governing and political elite. The madrasas were a specific educational institution, with their own funding and curricula, in contrast with the Enderun palace schools attended by Devshirme pupils.

==Definition==
=== Etymology ===
The word &#x27; derives from the triconsonantal Semitic root د-ر-س &quot;D-R-S&quot; &#x27;to learn, study&#x27;, using the &quot;wazn&quot; (morphological form or template) ; , meaning &quot;a place where something is done&quot;. Thus, &#x27; literally means &quot;a place where learning and studying take place&quot; or &quot;place of study&quot;. The word is also present as a loanword with the same general meaning in many Arabic-influenced languages, such as: Urdu, Pashto, Baluchi, Persian, Turkish, Azeri, Kurdish, Indonesian, Somali and Bosnian.

=== Arabic meaning ===
In the Arabic language, the word &#x27; simply means the same as &quot;school&quot; does in the English language, whether that is private, public or parochial school, as well as for any primary or secondary school whether Muslim, non-Muslim, or secular. Unlike the use of the word &quot;school&quot; in British English, the word &quot;&quot; more closely resembles the term &quot;school&quot; in American English, in that it can refer to a university-level or post-graduate school as well as to a primary or secondary school. For example, in the Ottoman Empire during the Early Modern Period, madrasas had lower schools and specialised schools where the students became known as &quot;danişmends&quot;. In medieval usage, however, the term &quot;madrasah&quot; was usually specific to institutions of higher learning, which generally taught Islamic law and occasionally other subjects, as opposed to elementary schools or children&#x27;s schools, which were usually known as &quot;kuttāb&quot;, &quot;khalwa&quot; or &quot;maktab&quot;. The usual Arabic word for a university, however, is &quot;()&quot;. The Hebrew cognate &quot;midrasha&quot; also connotes the meaning of a place of learning; the related term &quot;midrash&quot; literally refers to study or learning, but has acquired mystical and religious connotations.

=== Meaning and usage in English ===
In English, the term &quot;&quot; or &quot;madrasa&quot; usually refers more narrowly to Islamic institutions of learning. Historians and other scholars also employ the term to refer to historical learning institutions throughout the Muslim world, which is to say a college where Islamic law was taught along with other secondary subjects, but not to secular science schools, modern or historical. These institutions were typically housed in specially designed buildings which were primarily devoted to this purpose. Such institutions are believed to have originated, or at least proliferated, in the region of Iran in the 11th century under vizier Nizam al-Mulk and subsequently spread to other regions of the Islamic world.

==History==
=== Early history ===
The first institute of madrasa education was at the estate of Zayd ibn Arqam near a hill called Safa, where Muhammad was the teacher and the students were some of his followers. After Hijrah (migration) the madrasa of &quot;Suffa&quot; was established in Madina on the east side of the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi mosque. Ubada ibn as-Samit was appointed there by Muhammad as teacher and among the students. In the curriculum of the madrasa, there were teachings of The Qur&#x27;an, The Hadith, fara&#x27;iz, tajweed, genealogy, treatises of first aid, etc. There was also training in horse-riding, the art of war, handwriting and calligraphy, athletics and martial arts. The first part of madrasa-based education is estimated from the first day of &quot;nabuwwat&quot; to the first portion of the Umayyad Caliphate. At the beginning of the Caliphate period, the reliance on courts initially confined sponsorship and scholarly activities to major centres.

In the early history of the Islamic period, teaching was generally carried out in mosques rather than in separate specialized institutions. Although some major early mosques like the Great Mosque of Damascus or the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in Cairo had separate rooms which were devoted to teaching, this distinction between &quot;mosque&quot; and &quot;madrasa&quot; was not very present. Notably, the al-Qarawiyyin (&quot;Jāmiʻat al-Qarawīyīn&quot;), established in 859 in the city of Fes, present-day Morocco, is considered the oldest university in the world by some scholars, though the application of the term &quot;university&quot; to institutions of the medieval Muslim world is disputed. According to tradition, the al-Qarawiyyin mosque was founded by &quot;&quot;, the daughter of a wealthy merchant named . This was later followed by the Fatimid establishment of al-Azhar Mosque in 969–970 in Cairo, initially as a center to promote Isma&#x27;ili teachings, which later became a Sunni institution under Ayyubid rule (today&#x27;s Al-Azhar University). By the 900s AD, the Madrasa is noted to have become a successful higher education system.

=== The development of the formal &quot;madrasah&quot; ===

In the late 11th century, during the late ʻAbbāsid period, the Seljuk vizier  created one of the first major official academic institutions known in history as the , based on the informal &#x27; (sessions of the shaykhs). , who would later be murdered by the Assassins (&#x27;), created a system of state madrasas (in his time they were called the Niẓāmiyyahs, named after him) in various Seljuk and ʻAbbāsid cities at the end of the 11th century, ranging from Mesopotamia to Khorasan. Although madrasa-type institutions appear to have existed in Iran before Nizam al-Mulk, this period is nonetheless considered by many as the starting point for the proliferation of the formal &quot;madrasah&quot; across the rest of the Muslim world, adapted for use by all four different Sunni Islamic legal schools and Sufi orders. Part of the motivation for this widespread adoption of the madrasah by Sunni rulers and elites was a desire to counter the influence and spread of Shi&#x27;ism at the time, by using these institutions to spread Sunni teachings.

Dimitri Gutas and the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; consider the period between the 11th and 14th centuries to be the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Arabic and Islamic philosophy, initiated by al-Ghazali&#x27;s successful integration of logic into the curriculum and the subsequent rise of Avicennism. In addition to religious subjects, they taught the &quot;rational sciences,&quot; as varied as mathematics, astronomy, astrology, geography, alchemy and philosophy depending on the curriculum of the specific institution in question. The madrasas, however, were not centres of advanced scientific study; scientific advances in Islam were usually carried out by scholars working under the patronage of royal courts. During the Islamic Golden Age, the territories under the Caliphate experienced a growth in literacy, having the highest literacy rate of the Middle Ages, comparable to classical Athens&#x27; literacy in antiquity but on a much larger scale. The emergence of the maktab and madrasa institutions played a fundamental role in the relatively high literacy rates of the medieval Islamic world.
Under the Anatolian Seljuk, Zengid, Ayyubid, and Mamluk dynasties (11th-16th centuries) in the Middle East, many of the ruling elite founded madrasas through a religious endowment and charitable trust known as a &quot;waqf&quot;. The first documented madrasa created in Syria was the Madrasa of Kumushtakin, added to a mosque in Bosra in 1136. One of the earliest madrasas in Damascus, and one of the first madrasas to be accompanied by the tomb of its founder, is the Madrasa al-Nuriyya (or Madrasa al-Kubra) founded by Nur al-Din Zengi in 1167–1172. After Salah ad-Din (Saladin) overthrew the Shi&#x27;a Fatimids in Egypt in 1171, he founded a Sunni madrasa near the tomb of al-Shafi&#x27;i in Cairo in 1176–1177, introducing this institution to Egypt. The Mamluks who succeeded the Ayyubids built many more madrasas across their territories. Not only was the madrasa a potent symbol of status for its patrons but it could also be an effective means of transmitting wealth and status to their descendants. Especially during the Mamluk period, when only former slaves (&quot;mamālīk&quot;) could assume power, the sons of the ruling Mamluk elites were unable to inherit. Guaranteed positions within the new madrasas (and other similar foundations) thus allowed them to maintain some status and means of living even after their fathers&#x27; deaths. Madrasas built in this period were often associated with the mausoleums of their founders.

Further west, the Hafsid dynasty introduced the first madrasas to Ifriqiya, beginning with the Madrasa al-Shamma῾iyya built in Tunis in 1238 (or in 1249 according to some sources). By the late 13th century, the first madrasas were being built in Morocco under the Marinid dynasty, starting with the Saffarin Madrasa in Fes (founded in 1271) and culminating with much larger and more ornate constructions like the Bou Inania Madrasa (founded in 1350).

During the Ottoman period the &quot;medrese&quot; (Turkish word for &quot;madrasah&quot;) was a common institution as well, often part of a larger &quot;külliye&quot; or a &quot;waqf&quot;-based religious foundation which included other elements like a mosque and a &quot;hammam&quot; (public bathhouse). The following excerpt provides a brief synopsis of the historical origins and starting points for the teachings that took place in the Ottoman madrasas in the Early Modern Period:

== Islamic education in the madrasa ==
The term &quot;Islamic education&quot; means education in the light of Islam itself, which is rooted in the teachings of the Qur&#x27;an - the holy book of the Muslims. Islamic education and Muslim education are not the same. Because Islamic education has epistemological integration which is founded on Tawhid - Oneness or monotheism. To Islam, the Quran is the core of all learning, it is described in this journal as the “Spine of all discipline”

A typical Islamic school usually offers two courses of study: a &quot;&quot; course teaching memorization of the Qur&#x27;an (the person who commits the entire Qur&#x27;an to memory is called a ); and an  course leading the candidate to become an accepted scholar in the community. A regular curriculum includes courses in Arabic, &quot;tafsir&quot; (Qur&#x27;anic interpretation),  (Islamic law), hadith, mantiq (logic), and Muslim history. In the Ottoman Empire, during the Early Modern Period, the study of hadiths was introduced by Süleyman I. Depending on the educational demands, some madrasas also offer additional advanced courses in Arabic literature, English and other foreign languages, as well as science and world history. Ottoman madrasas along with religious teachings also taught &quot;styles of writing, grammar, syntax, poetry, composition, natural sciences, political sciences, and etiquette.&quot;

People of all ages attend, and many often move on to becoming imams. The certificate of an &quot;ʻālim&quot;, for example, requires approximately twelve years of study. A good number of the &quot;ḥuffāẓ&quot; (plural of &quot;ḥāfiẓ&quot;) are the product of the madrasas. The madrasas also resemble colleges, where people take evening classes and reside in dormitories. An important function of the madrasas is to admit orphans and poor children in order to provide them with education and training. Madrasas may enroll female students; however, they study separately from the men.

== Education in historical madrasas ==
===Elementary education===
In the medieval Islamic world, an elementary school (for children or for those learning to read) was known as a &#x27;kuttāb&#x27; or &#x27;. Their exact origin is uncertain, but they appear to have been already widespread in the early Abbasid period (8th-9th centuries) and may have played an early role in socializing new ethnic and demographic groups into the Islamic religion during the first few centuries after the Arab-Muslim conquests of the region. Like madrasas (which referred to higher education), a was often attached to an endowed mosque. In the 11th century, the famous Persian Islamic philosopher and teacher  (known as &quot;Avicenna&quot; in the West), in one of his books, wrote a chapter about the &#x27; entitled &quot;The Role of the Teacher in the Training and Upbringing of Children&quot;, as a guide to teachers working at &#x27; schools. He wrote that children can learn better if taught in classes instead of individual tuition from private tutors, and he gave a number of reasons for why this is the case, citing the value of competition and emulation among pupils, as well as the usefulness of group discussions and debates. described the curriculum of a &#x27; school in some detail, describing the curricula for two stages of education in a &quot;&quot; school.

====Primary education====

 wrote that children should be sent to a &quot;&quot; school from the age of 6 and be taught primary education until they reach the age of 14. During which time, he wrote, they should be taught the Qur&#x27;an, Islamic metaphysics, Arabic, literature, Islamic ethics, and manual skills (which could refer to a variety of practical skills).

====Secondary education====
 refers to the secondary education stage of &quot;&quot; schooling as a period of specialisation when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status. He writes that children after the age of 14 should be allowed to choose and specialise in subjects they have an interest in, whether it was reading, manual skills, literature, preaching, medicine, geometry, trade and commerce, craftsmanship, or any other subject or profession they would be interested in pursuing for a future career. He wrote that this was a transitional stage and that there needs to be flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduate, as the student&#x27;s emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account.

===Higher education===

During its formative period, the term &quot;&quot; referred to a higher education institution, whose curriculum initially included only the &quot;religious sciences&quot;, whilst philosophy and the secular sciences were often excluded. The curriculum slowly began to diversify, with many later madrasas teaching both the religious and the &quot;secular sciences&quot;, such as logic, mathematics and philosophy. Some madrasas further extended their curriculum to history, politics, ethics, music, metaphysics, medicine, astronomy and chemistry. The curriculum of a was usually set by its founder, but most generally taught both the religious sciences and the physical sciences. Madrasas were established throughout the Islamic world, examples being the ninth century University of al-Qarawiyyin, the tenth century al-Azhar University (the most famous), the eleventh century , as well as 75 madrasas in Cairo, 51 in Damascus and up to 44 in Aleppo between 1155 and 1260. Institutions of learning were established in the Andalusian cities of Córdoba, Seville, Toledo, Granada, Murcia, Almería, Valencia and Cádiz during the Caliphate of Córdoba.

In the Ottoman Empire during the early modern period, &quot;Madaris were divided into lower and specialised levels, which reveals that there was a sense of elevation in school. Students who studied in the specialised schools after completing courses in the lower levels became known as &quot;danişmends&quot;.&quot;

Mosques were more than a place of worship as they were also utilized as an area to host community transactions of business. It was the center of most of a city&#x27;s social and cultural life. Along with this came trades of information and teachings. As the mosque was a starting ground for religious discourse in the Islamic world, these &quot;madrasas&quot; became more common. In this context, a madrasa would be referred to as a localized area or center within the mosque for studies and teachings relating the Quran. Among the first advanced topics featured at a &quot;madrasa&quot; was Islamic law. There was a premium fee required to study Islamic law, which was sometimes fronted by state or private subsidiaries. The topics of this higher education also expanded larger than the Islamic time and area. Arab translations of Greco-Roman classical texts were often examined for mathematical and grammatical discourse. Since the focus of theology and legal study was utmost, specified law schools began their own development. On the theological side however, these remained mainly at the general &quot;madrasa&quot; since it was more common and easier for the lower-level students to approach. The requirement of competent teachers to keep a madrasa up and running was also important. It was not uncommon for these scholars to be involved in multiple fields such as Abd al-Latif who was an expert in medicine, grammar, linguistics, law, alchemy, and philosophy. The choice of freedom in inquiry was also important. Muslim higher education at &quot;madrasas&quot; offered not only mastery in specified fields but also a more generalized, broader option.

In Muslim India, the &quot;madrasa&quot; started off as providing higher education similarly to other parts of the Islamic world. The primary function for these institutions was to train and prepare workers for bureaucratic work as well as the judicial system. The curriculum generally consisted of logic, philosophy, law, history, politics, and particularly religious sciences, later incorporating more of mathematics, astronomy, geography, and medicine. &quot;Madrasas&quot; were often subsidized and founded by states or private individuals, and well-qualified teachers filled in the role for professors. Foundations of Islamic higher education in India is tied to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate in 1206 which set a basis of importance for Muslim education. Under control of the Delhi Sultanate, two early important madrasas were founded. The first was the Mu’zziyya named after Muḥammad Ghuri of the Ghorid Dynasty and his title of Muʿizz al-Dīn and founded by Sultan Iltutmish. The other &quot;madrasa&quot; was the Nāṣiriyya, named after Nāṣir al-Dīn Maḥmūd and built by Balban. These two &quot;madrasas&quot; bear importance as a starting point for higher education for Muslim India. Babur of the Mughal Empire founded a &quot;madrasa&quot; in Delhi which he specifically included the subjects of mathematics, astronomy, and geography besides the standard subjects of law, history, secular and religious sciences. Although little is known about the management and inner workings of these places of Islamic higher education, religious studies bore the focus amongst most other subjects, particularly the rational sciences such as mathematics, logic, medicine, and astronomy. Although some tried to emphasize these subjects more, it is doubtful that every &quot;madrasa&quot; made this effort.

While &quot; can now refer to any type of school, the term &quot; was originally used to refer more specifically to a medieval Islamic centre of learning, mainly teaching Islamic law and theology, usually affiliated with a mosque, and funded by an early charitable trust known as &quot;waqf&quot;.

====Law school====
Madrasas were largely centred on the study of &#x27; (Islamic jurisprudence). The &quot;&quot; (&quot;licence to teach and issue legal opinions&quot;) in the medieval Islamic legal education system had its origins in the ninth century after the formation of the &quot;&quot; (schools of jurisprudence). George Makdisi considers the &#x27; to be the origin of the European doctorate. However, in an earlier article, he considered the &#x27; to be of &quot;fundamental difference&quot; to the medieval doctorate, since the former was awarded by an individual teacher-scholar not obliged to follow any formal criteria, whereas the latter was conferred on the student by the collective authority of the faculty. To obtain an &#x27;, a student &quot;had to study in a guild school of law, usually four years for the basic undergraduate course&quot; and ten or more years for a post-graduate course. The &quot;doctorate was obtained after an oral examination to determine the originality of the candidate&#x27;s theses&quot;, and to test the student&#x27;s &quot;ability to defend them against all objections, in disputations set up for the purpose.&quot; These were scholarly exercises practised throughout the student&#x27;s &quot;career as a graduate student of law.&quot; After students completed their post-graduate education, they were awarded &quot;ijaza&quot;s giving them the status of &quot;&quot; &#x27;scholar of jurisprudence&#x27;, &quot;&quot; &#x27;scholar competent in issuing fatwās&#x27;, and &quot;&quot; &#x27;teacher&#x27;.
The Arabic term &#x27; was awarded to Islamic scholars who were qualified to teach. According to Makdisi, the Latin title &quot;licentia docendi&quot; &#x27;licence to teach&#x27; in the European university may have been a translation of the Arabic, but the underlying concept was very different. A significant difference between the &#x27; and the &quot;licentia docendi&quot; was that the former was awarded by the individual scholar-teacher, while the latter was awarded by the chief official of the university, who represented the collective faculty, rather than the individual scholar-teacher.

Much of the study in the college centred on examining whether certain opinions of law were orthodox. This scholarly process of &quot;determining orthodoxy began with a question which the Muslim layman, called in that capacity &quot;&quot;, presented to a jurisconsult, called &quot;mufti&quot;, soliciting from him a response, called &quot;fatwa&quot;, a legal opinion (the religious law of Islam covers civil as well as religious matters). The &quot;mufti&quot; (professor of legal opinions) took this question, studied it, researched it intensively in the sacred scriptures, in order to find a solution to it. This process of scholarly research was called &quot;&quot;, literally, the exertion of one&#x27;s efforts to the utmost limit.&quot;

====Medical school====
Though Islamic medicine was most often taught at the bimaristan teaching hospitals, there were also several medical madrasas dedicated to the teaching of medicine. For example, of the 155 madrasa colleges in 15th century Damascus, three of them were medical schools.

Toby Huff argues that no medical degrees were granted to students, as there was no faculty that could issue them, and that therefore, no system of examination and certification developed in the Islamic tradition like that of medieval Europe. However, the historians Andrew C. Miller, Nigel J. Shanks and Dawshe Al-Kalai point out that, during this era, physician licensure became mandatory in the Abbasid Caliphate. In 931 AD, Caliph Al-Muqtadir learned of the death of one of his subjects as a result of a physician&#x27;s error. He immediately ordered his muhtasib Sinan ibn Thabit to examine and prevent doctors from practicing until they passed an examination. From this time on, licensing exams were required and only qualified physicians were allowed to practice medicine. The study of Medicine and many other sciences that took place in Madrasas made large contributions to western societies in later years.

In the Early Modern Period in the Ottoman Empire, &quot;Suleyman I added new curriculums [&#x27;sic&#x27;] to the Ottoman medreses of which one was medicine, which alongside studying of the was given highest rank.&quot;

====Madrasa and university====
:&quot;Note: The word &quot;&quot; () simply means &#x27;university&#x27;. For more information, see Islamic university (disambiguation).&quot;
Scholars like Arnold H. Green and Seyyed Hossein Nasr have argued that, starting in the tenth century, some medieval Islamic madrasas indeed became universities. However, scholars like George Makdisi, Toby Huff and Norman Daniel argue that the European medieval university has no parallel in the medieval Islamic world. Darleen Pryds questions this view, pointing out that madrasas and European universities in the Mediterranean region shared similar foundations by princely patrons and were intended to provide loyal administrators to further the rulers&#x27; agenda. Some other scholars regard the university as uniquely European in origin and characteristics.

Al-Qarawīyīn University in Fez, present-day Morocco is recognised by many historians as the oldest degree-granting university in the world, having been founded in 859 as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri. While the madrasa college could also issue degrees at all levels, the &quot;jāmiʻah&quot;s (such as al-Qarawīyīn and al-Azhar University) differed in the sense that they were larger institutions, more universal in terms of their complete source of studies, had individual faculties for different subjects, and could house a number of mosques, madrasas, and other institutions within them. Such an institution has thus been described as an &quot;Islamic university&quot;.

Al-Azhar University, founded in Cairo, Egypt in 975 by the Ismaʻīlī Shīʻī Fatimid dynasty as a &#x27;, had individual faculties for a theological seminary, Islamic law and jurisprudence, Arabic grammar, Islamic astronomy, early Islamic philosophy and logic in Islamic philosophy. In the second half of the 19th century in Egypt, Muslim Egyptians began to attend secular schools, and a movement arose in the late 19th to the early 20th century to &quot;modernize&quot; al-Azhar. The postgraduate doctorate in law was only obtained after &quot;an oral examination to determine the originality of the candidate&#x27;s theses&quot;, and to test the student&#x27;s &quot;ability to defend them against all objections, in disputations set up for the purpose.&quot; ‘Abd al-Laṭīf al-Baghdādī also delivered lectures on Islamic medicine at al-Azhar, while Maimonides delivered lectures on medicine and astronomy there during the time of Saladin. Another early &#x27; was the Niẓāmīyah of Baghdād (founded 1091), which has been called the &quot;largest university of the Medieval world.&quot; Mustansiriya University, established by the ʻAbbāsid caliph al-Mustanṣir in 1227, in addition to teaching the religious subjects, offered courses dealing with philosophy, mathematics and the natural sciences. Madrasas by the 11th century had buildings and full time working educators. These educators were provided with places to live inside the madrasas. The institutions by this time occumulated a wide spread of attendance among the population. The attraction of the educational institution was that it provided free education for everyone in attendance. Furthermore, sciences at madrasas were indeed taught, and much of the material was from well-known scholars of the sciences such as Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, who was the “most famous and most successful” editor of the Shi’i law, kalam philosophy which include mathematic works and astrology.

However, the classification of madrasas as &quot;universities&quot; is disputed on the question of understanding of each institution on its own terms. In madrasas, the &quot;ijāzahs&quot; were only issued in one field, the Islamic religious law of , and in no other field of learning. Other academic subjects, including the natural sciences, philosophy and literary studies, were only treated &quot;ancillary&quot; to the study of the Sharia. For example, at least in Sunni madrasas, astronomy was only studied (if at all) to supply religious needs, like the time for prayer. This is why Ptolemaic astronomy was considered adequate, and is still taught in some modern day madrasas. The Islamic law undergraduate degree from al-Azhar, the most prestigious madrasa, was traditionally granted without final examinations, but on the basis of the students&#x27; attentive attendance to courses. In contrast to the medieval doctorate which was granted by the collective authority of the faculty, the Islamic degree was not granted by the teacher to the pupil based on any formal criteria, but remained a &quot;personal matter, the sole prerogative of the person bestowing it; no one could force him to give one&quot;.

Although there is a sort of validity to what was just mentioned in this section, more specifically in the previous paragraph, other sources also convey that an emphasis on the teaching of sciences in madrasas, and the licensing of &quot;ijāzahs&quot; to those who proved satisfactory in the knowledge of their specific scientific field of study, were indeed conducted. It is historically inaccurate to definitively mention that all forms of science were studied solely for the advancement/supplication of religious needs. This can be evident when one further examines the specific fields of secular sciences that have achieved an established position in madrasa curriculum. Such fields included the sciences of mathematics, medicine and pharmacology, natural philosophy, divination, magic, and alchemy (The last three being clumped up into one set of coursework). To support the claims mentioned earlier in this section, it has been noted that &quot;ijāzahs&quot; are not issued to these sciences as much as they are to religious studies, yet at the same time, there is no evidence fully supporting that none were given to these subjects. Clear examples of the issuing of such &quot;ijāzahs&quot; can be seen in numerous manuscripts, or more specifically, in Shams al-Din al-Sakhawi&#x27;s multiple collections of manuscript titles and biographies. Further evidence of this was illustrated by al-Sakhawi. He mentioned that in places like Syria and Egypt, it has been suggested that public performances of knowledge, which its conduction was required for one to finally receive their &quot;ijāzah,&quot; included mathematics in its content. There are plenty of other examples of the issuance of &quot;ijazahs&quot; for scientific subjects. Ali b. Muhammad al-Qalasadi, a prominent mathematician in his day, was mentioned to be responsible for giving his students an &quot;ijāzah&quot; to teach his mathematical treatise on the dust letters. Ibn al-Nafis gave an &quot;ijazah&quot; to his student al-Quff for proving sufficient in knowledge of his commentary on the medical book, &quot;On the Nature of Man&quot;. In addition, a copy of a commentary on Hunayn b. Ishaq&#x27;s, &quot;Problems of Medicine for Students,&quot; managed to show that one of its readers had sufficient knowledge in the medical text, &quot;Synopses of the Alexandrians.&quot; Later on in this commentary, an &quot;ijazah&quot;, issued by a physician from Damascus, was present to confirm that one was indeed issued here for said student. Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi was a student of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi who was considered to be a proficient polymath, astronomer, philosopher, and physician who issued an &quot;ijazah&quot; to Najm al-Milla wa-l-Din M. b. M. b. Abi Bakr al-Tabrizi. This license was very extensive, allowing him to teach religious, philosophical, and even medical texts like Ibn Sina&#x27;s first book in his &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot;. These are just a few select/historical examples of the issuance of &quot;ijazahs&quot; for scientific subjects, thereby proving that such licenses were indeed issued along with those regarding religious studies. There are many more examples of this that are not listed on this page, but can easily be found. When taking this evidence into account, one may then reasonably assume that the presence, teaching, and licensing of certain sciences in madrasas has been historically underrepresented. This information, along with some of what is discussed in the following sections/paragraphs on this page, may now hopefully help one in identifying whether or not madrasas can indeed be classified as &quot;Universities&quot;. However, arguments for why they should not be classified as such will later be proposed as well.

Medievalist specialists who define the university as a legally autonomous corporation disagree with the term &quot;university&quot; for the Islamic madrasas and &quot;jāmi‘ah&quot;s because the medieval university (from Latin &quot;universitas&quot;) was structurally different, being a legally autonomous corporation rather than a &quot;waqf&quot; institution like the madrasa and &#x27;. Despite the many similarities, medieval specialists have coined the term &quot;Islamic college&quot; for madrasa and &#x27; to differentiate them from the legally autonomous corporations that the medieval European universities were. In a sense, the madrasa resembles a university college in that it has most of the features of a university, but lacks the corporate element. Toby Huff summarises the difference as follows: 

As Muslim institutions of higher learning, the madrasa had the legal designation of waqf. In central and eastern Islamic lands, the view that the madrasa, as a charitable endowment, will remain under the control of the donor (and their descendant), resulted in a &quot;spurt&quot; of establishment of madrasas in the 11th and 12th centuries. However, in Western Islamic lands, where the Maliki views prohibited donors from controlling their endowment, madrasas were not as popular. Unlike the corporate designation of Western institutions of higher learning, the waqf designation seemed to have led to the exclusion of non-orthodox religious subjects such a philosophy and natural science from the curricula. The madrasa of al-Qarawīyīn, one of the two surviving madrasas that predate the founding of the earliest medieval universities and are thus claimed to be the &quot;first universities&quot; by some authors, has acquired official university status as late as 1947. The other, al-Azhar, did acquire this status in name and essence only in the course of numerous reforms during the 19th and 20th century, notably the one of 1961 which introduced non-religious subjects to its curriculum, such as economics, engineering, medicine, and agriculture. Many medieval universities were run for centuries as Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools prior to their formal establishment as &quot;universitas scholarium&quot;; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the university dates back to the sixth century AD, thus well preceding the earliest madrasas. George Makdisi, who has published most extensively on the topic concludes in his comparison between the two institutions: 

Nevertheless, Makdisi has asserted that the European university borrowed many of its features from the Islamic madrasa, including the concepts of a degree and doctorate. Makdisi and Hugh Goddard have also highlighted other terms and concepts now used in modern universities which most likely have Islamic origins, including &quot;the fact that we still talk of professors holding the &#x27;chairman&#x27; of their subject&quot; being based on the &quot;traditional Islamic pattern of teaching where the professor sits on a chair and the students sit around him&quot;, the term &#x27;academic circles&#x27; being derived from the way in which Islamic students &quot;sat in a circle around their professor&quot;, and terms such as &quot;having &#x27;fellows&#x27;, &#x27;reading&#x27; a subject, and obtaining &#x27;degrees&#x27;, can all be traced back&quot; to the Islamic concepts of &#x27; (&#x27;companions, as of Muhammad&#x27;), &#x27; (&#x27;reading aloud the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;) and &quot;&quot; (&#x27;licence [to teach]&#x27;) respectively. Makdisi has listed eighteen such parallels in terminology which can be traced back to their roots in Islamic education. Some of the practices now common in modern universities which Makdisi and Goddard trace back to an Islamic root include &quot;practices such as delivering inaugural lectures, wearing academic robes, obtaining doctorates by defending a thesis, and even the idea of academic freedom are also modelled on Islamic custom.&quot; The Islamic scholarly system of &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, meaning opinion and consensus respectively, formed the basis of the &quot;scholarly system the West has practised in university scholarship from the Middle Ages down to the present day.&quot; According to Makdisi and Goddard, &quot;the idea of academic freedom&quot; in universities was also &quot;modelled on Islamic custom&quot; as practised in the medieval Madrasa system from the ninth century. Islamic influence was &quot;certainly discernible in the foundation of the first deliberately planned university&quot; in Europe, the University of Naples Federico II founded by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor in 1224.

However, all of these facets of medieval university life are considered by other scholars to be independent medieval European developments with no necessary Islamic influence. Norman Daniel criticizes Makdisi for overstating his case by simply resting on &quot;the accumulation of close parallels&quot; while failing to point to convincing channels of transmission between the Muslim and Christian world. Daniel also points out that the Arab equivalent of the Latin disputation, the &quot;taliqa&quot;, was reserved for the ruler&#x27;s court, not the madrasa, and that the actual differences between Islamic fiqh and medieval European civil law were profound. The taliqa only reached Islamic Spain, the only likely point of transmission, after the establishment of the first medieval universities. Moroever, there is no Latin translation of the taliqa and, most importantly, no evidence of Latin scholars ever showing awareness of Arab influence on the Latin method of disputation, something they would have certainly found noteworthy. Rather, it was the medieval reception of the Greek Organon which set the scholastic sic et non in motion. Daniel concludes that resemblances in method had more to with the two religions having &quot;common problems: to reconcile the conflicting statements of their own authorities, and to safeguard the data of revelation from the impact of Greek philosophy&quot;; thus Christian scholasticism and similar Arab concepts should be viewed in terms of a parallel occurrence, not of the transmission of ideas from one to the other, a view shared by Hugh Kennedy. Toby Huff, in a discussion of Makdisi&#x27;s hypothesis, argues:

George Saliba criticized Huff&#x27;s views regarding the legal autonomy of European universities and limited curriculum of Madrasahs, demonstrating that there were many Madrasahs dedicated to the teaching of non-religious subjects and arguing that Madrasahs generally had greater legal autonomy than medieval European universities. According to Saliba, Madrasahs &quot;were fully protected from interference in their curriculum by the very endowments that established them in the first place.&quot; Examples include the Dakhwariyya madrasah in Damascus, which was dedicated to medicine, a subject also taught at Islamic hospitals; the Madrasah established by Kamal al-Din Ibn Man`a (d. 1242) in Mosul which taught astronomy, music, and the Old the New Testaments; Ulugh Beg&#x27;s Madrasah in Samarqand which taught astronomy; and Shi`i madrasahs in Iran which taught astronomy along with religious studies. According to Saliba:

===Female education===

Prior to the 12th century, women accounted for less than one percent of the world&#x27;s Islamic scholars. However, al-Sakhawi and Mohammad Akram Nadwi have since found evidence of over 8,000 female scholars since the 15th century. al-Sakhawi devotes an entire volume of his 12-volume biographical dictionary &quot;&quot; to female scholars, giving information on 1,075 of them. More recently, the scholar Mohammad Akram Nadwi, currently a researcher from the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, has written 40 volumes on the  (the women scholars of hadith), and found at least 8,000 of them.

From around 750, during the Abbasid Caliphate, women &quot;became renowned for their brains as well as their beauty&quot;. In particular, many well known women of the time were trained from childhood in music, dancing and poetry. Mahbuba was one of these. Another female (albeit probably fictional) figure to be remembered for her achievements was Tawaddud, &quot;a slave girl who was said to have been bought at great cost by  because she had passed her examinations by the most eminent scholars in astronomy, medicine, law, philosophy, music, history, Arabic grammar, literature, theology and chess&quot;. Moreover, among the most prominent feminine figures was Shuhda who was known as &quot;the Scholar&quot; or &quot;the Pride of Women&quot; during the 12th century in Baghdad. Despite the recognition of women&#x27;s aptitudes during the Abbasid dynasty, all these came to an end in Iraq with the sack of Baghdad in 1258.

According to the Sunni scholar  in the 12th century, there were opportunities for female education in the medieval Islamic world, writing that women could study, earn &quot;ijazahs&quot; (academic degrees), and qualify as scholars and teachers. This was especially the case for learned and scholarly families, who wanted to ensure the highest possible education for both their sons and daughters. Ibn ʻAsakir had himself studied under 80 different female teachers in his time. Female education in the Islamic world was inspired by Muhammad&#x27;s wives, such as Khadijah, a successful businesswoman, and &#x27;A&#x27;isha, a strong leader and interpreter of the Prophet&#x27;s actions. According to a hadith attributed both to Muhammad and &#x27;A&#x27;isha, the women of Medina were praiseworthy because of their desire for religious knowledge: Although female madrasas did exist before the 1970s large strides were made is regards to female education. After the 1970s a large increase in total female madrasas took place expanded very rapidly across the region.

While it was not common for women to enroll as students in formal classes, it was common for women to attend informal lectures and study sessions at mosques, madrasas and other public places. While there were no legal restrictions on female education, some men did not approve of this practice, such as Muhammad ibn al-Hajj (d. 1336) who was appalled at the behaviour of some women who informally audited lectures in his time:

The term &quot;&quot; is often translated as &#x27;that which is indecent&#x27;, which usually meant the exposure of anything other than a woman&#x27;s face and hands, although scholarly interpretations of the &quot;&quot; and  have always tended to vary, with some more or less strict than others.Women played an important role in the foundations of many Islamic educational institutions, such as Fatima al-Fihri&#x27;s founding of the al-Qarawiyyin mosque in 859, which later developed into a madrasa. The role of female patrons was also evident during the Ayyubid dynasty in the 12th and 13th centuries, when 160 mosques and madrasas were established in Damascus, 26 of which were funded by women through the &quot;waqf&quot; (charitable trust) system. Half of all the royal patrons for these institutions were also women. Royal women were also major patrons of culture and architecture in the Ottoman Empire, founding many &quot;külliye&quot;s (religious and charitable complexes) that included madrasas.

In the 20th century in Indonesia, madrasas founded by women played an important role in increasing educational standards in the country. In November 1923, Rahmah el Yunusiyah opened a school located in Padang Panjang called or . This school is generally thought to be the first Muslim religious school in the country for young girls. El Yunusiyah, a deeply religious woman, believed that Islam demanded a central role for women and women&#x27;s education. The school gained considerable popularity and by the end of the 1930s had as many as five hundred students. The scholar Audrey Kahin calls &quot;Diniyah Putri&quot; &quot;one of the most successful and influential of the schools for women&quot; in pre-independence Indonesia.

While madrasas continue to play a pivotal role in the education of many, including young girls, there are still some cultural norms that find their way into the hallways and classrooms of these institutions. In article from 2021, Hem Borker, a professor at Jamia Millia Islamia, had the opportunity to travel to India and see the daily life of girls at a residential madrasa. In these madrasas in Northern India, young girls have the ability to receive an education, however, many of the practices within these institutions can be seen as very restrictive or at least by Western standards. Many madrasas that enroll girls act as &quot;purdah institutions.&quot; In Persian, purdah translates to curtain or cover. With respect to these madrasas in Northern India, a purdah institution is an institution in which there are several guidelines female students must adhere to as a way to cover themselves both physically and culturally, These restrictions are based on the students&#x27; gender and create a segregation of sorts. Girls are expected to wear veils over their faces and cover their entire bodies as a means of dressing modestly by cultural standards. In addition to the clothes that these girls wear, the physical building itself also adheres to the ideals of a purdah institution. Classrooms and hallways are separated by gender in order to prevent fraternization. Within many of these madrasas, even the windows are lined with metal grills in order to prevent students from looking to the outside as well as to prevent people on the outside to look inward. In addition to the physical layout of the building, there are a series of rules female students must adhere to. Some of these rules include girls must lower their head and their voice when addressing their male counterparts. As they pass windows, even with barriers blocking most of their view to the outside and blocking the view of those on the outside, they are expected to lower their gaze. Going back to the idea of clothing, they must wear a niqāb in order to go outside. Within a cultural context, these rules are very appropriate. In addition to teaching specific subject academic content, institutions such as these purdah madrasas are also incorporating appropriate cultural and societal behavior outside the walls of the building.

== Architecture ==
=== Architectural origins ===
Madrasas were generally centered around an interior courtyard and the classical madrasa form generally featured four iwans (vaulted chambers open on one side) arranged symmetrically around the courtyard. The origin of this architectural model may have been Buddhist monasteries in Transoxiana (Central Asia), of which some early surviving remains demonstrate this type of layout. Another possible origin may have been domestic houses in the region of Khorasan. Practically none of the first madrasas founded under Nizam al-Mulk (Seljuk vizier between 1064 and 1092) have survived, though partial remains of one madrasa in Khargerd, Iran, include an iwan and an inscription attributing it to Nizam al-Mulk. Nonetheless, it is clear that the Seljuks constructed many madrasas across their empire within a relatively short period of time, thus spreading both the idea of this institution and the architectural models on which later examples were based.

=== Evolution and spread across different regions ===
==== Seljuk Anatolia ====

In contrast to early Iranian Seljuk madrasas, a large number of madrasas from the Anatolian Seljuk Empire (between 1077 and 1308) have survived, and are the closest examples we have of Iranian-influenced early madrasa architecture. However, though each usually included a large central courtyard, their overall layouts were more variable and may have reflected more multi-purpose functions, often with an attached mausoleum, a minaret, and an ornate entrance portal. The courtyards were sometimes covered by a large dome (as with the Karatay Madrasa, founded in 1279, and other madrasas in Konya), reflecting an ongoing transition to domed Islamic buildings in Anatolia and later Ottoman architecture.

==== Syria and Egypt ====

In Syria and the surrounding region, the earliest madrasas were often relatively small buildings, the earliest example of which is one in Bosra founded in 1136–37. Madrasa architecture in this region appears to have evolved out of Seljuk prototypes. Another early important example is the Madrasa of Nur al-Din from 1167. Under the Ayyubid dynasty madrasas began to take on added importance, with the first madrasa in Egypt (no longer extant) being built by Salah ad-Din (Saladin) in 1180 next to the Mausoleum of Imam al-Shafi&#x27;i in Cairo&#x27;s Qarafa Cemetery. As with the earlier Seljuk madrasas, it is likely that these foundations were motivated by a desire to counteract the influence of Isma&#x27;ili proselytism and propaganda during the Fatimid Caliphate. Among the surviving Ayyubid madrasas in Egypt are the remains of the Madrasa of al-Kamil (founded by Sultan al-Kamil Ayyub in 1229) and the more important Madrasa al-Salihiyya founded by Sultan al-Salih Ayyub founded in 1242, to which was later attached al-Salih&#x27;s mausoleum. In Syria, an exceptional example of a monumental madrasa from this period is the al-Firdaws Madrasa in Aleppo. Many more examples from this period, however, have not survived.After the faltering of the Ayyubid dynasty and the transition to the Mamluk Sultanate around 1250, the Mamluks became eager patrons of architecture. Many of their projects involved the construction of madrasas as part of larger multi-functional religious complexes, usually attached to their personal mausoleums, which provided services to the general population while also promoting their own prestige and pious reputations. In Egyptian Mamluk architecture, which largely used stone, the madrasa layout generally had two prominent iwans which were aligned to the &quot;qibla&quot; and faced each other across a central courtyard, while two &quot;lateral&quot; iwans faced each across each on the other two sides of the courtyard. Prominent examples of these include the madrasa of the Sultan Qalawun complex (built in 1284–1285) and the neighbouring complex of his son al-Nasir Muhammad (finished in 1304). One exceptional madrasa, which also served as a mosque and was easily one of the most massive structures of its time, was the monumental Madrasa-Mosque of Sultan Hasan (built from 1356 to 1363), with a large central courtyard surrounded by four enormous iwans. While the unique Madrasa of Sultan Hasan provided instruction in all four Sunni legal schools of thought, most madrasas and mosques in Egypt followed the Shafi&#x27;i school. Moreover, due to the already dense urban fabric of Cairo, Mamluk architectural complexes adopted increasingly irregular and creatively designed floor plans to compensate for limited space while simultaneously attempting to maximize their prominence and visibility from the street.

While Mamluk architecture outside Cairo was generally of lesser quality and craftsmanship, there were nonetheless many examples. The Madrasa al-Zahiriyya in Damascus, which contains the mausoleum of Sultan Baybars I, is still essentially Ayyubid in style. The city of Tripoli in Lebanon also holds a concentration of Mamluk-era architecture, including madrasas. However, the most significant Mamluk archtiectural patronage outside of Cairo is likely in Jerusalem, as with the example of the major al-Ashrafiyya Madrasa on the Temple Mount (&quot;Haram al-Sharif&quot;), which was rebuilt in its current form by Sultan Qaytbay in the late 15th century.
Cruciform madrasas, which have a four-iwan plan, came to prominence in Egypt. They also appeared in Syria-Palestine, e.g., Jerusalem&#x27;s Tankiziyya, Arghūniyya, Ṭashtamuriyya, Muzhiriyya, and Damascus&#x27;s Ẓāhirīyah.

==== Maghreb (North Africa) ====

In northwestern Africa (the &quot;Maghrib&quot; or Maghreb), including Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, madrasas began to be constructed in the 13th century under the Marinid and Hafsid dynasties. In Tunisia (or Ifriqiya), the earliest Hafsid madrasa was the Madrasa al-Shamma&#x27;iyya founded in 1238 (or in 1249 according to some sources). In Morocco, the first madrasa was the Madrasa as-Saffarin built in Fes in 1271, followed by many others constructed around the country. The main architectural highlights among these are the Madrasa as-Sahrij (built in 1321–1328), the Madrasa al-Attarin (built in 1323–1325), and the Madrasa of Salé (completed in 1341), all of which are lavishly decorated with sculpted wood, carved stucco, and &quot;zellij&quot; mosaic tilework. The Bou Inania Madrasa in Fes, built in 1350–1355, distinguished itself from other madrasas by its size and by being the only madrasa which also officially functioned as a public Friday mosque. The Marinids also built madrasas in Algeria, particularly in Tlemcen.

In Morocco, madrasas were generally built in brick and wood and were still centered around a main internal courtyard with a central fountain or water basin, around which student dorms were distributed across one or two floors. A prayer hall or mosque chamber usually stood opposite the entrance on one side of the courtyard. The Bou Inania Madrasa in Fes also contained two side-chambers opening off the lateral sides of its courtyard, which may reflect an influence of the older four-iwan layout. However, most other Moroccan madrasas did not have this feature and the courtyards were instead flanked by ornate galleries. By contrast with Mamluk structures to the east, Moroccan and Maghrebi madrasas were not prominently distinguishable from the outside except for an ornate entrance portal decorated with carved wood and stucco. This model continued to be found in later madrasas like the Ben Youssef Madrasa of the 16th century in Marrakesh.

==== Iran, Iraq, and Central Asia ====

Very few if any formal madrasas from before the Mongol invasions have survived in Iran. One exception is the Mustansiriyya Madrasa in Baghdad, which dates from 1227 and is also the earliest &quot;universal&quot; madrasa, which is to say the first madrasa that taught all four Sunni &quot;maddhab&quot;s (legal schools of thought). Later, the Mongol Ilkhanid dynasty and the many dynasties that followed them (e.g. the Timurids and Safavids) nonetheless built numerous monumental madrasas, many of which are excellent examples of Iranian Islamic architecture. In some cases, these madrasas were directly attached and integrated into larger mosques, as with those attached to the Shah Mosque in Isfahan (17th century). In other cases they were built as more or less separate entities, such as with the Chahar Bagh Madrasa (also in Isfahan, 17th-18th centuries), or the 15th-century Timurid Ulugh Beg Madrasa and two other monumental 17th-century madrasas at the Registan complex in Samarkand.

The form of the madrasa does not appear to have changed significantly over time in this region. The Timurid period (late 14th and 15th century), however, was a &quot;golden age&quot; of Iranian madrasas, during which the four-iwan model was made much larger and more monumental, on a par with major mosques, thanks to intense patronage from Timur and his successors. Madrasas in the Iranian architectural tradition continued to be centered around a large square or rectangular courtyard with a central water basin and surrounded by a one or two-story arcade. Either two or four large iwans stood at the ends of the central axes of the courtyard.

==== Ottoman Empire ====

Ottoman architecture evolved out of its Anatolian Seljuk predecessors into a particular style. In the classical Ottoman period (15th-16th centuries), the typical form of the madrasa had become a large courtyard surrounded by an arched gallery covered by a series of domes, similar to the &quot;sahn&quot; (courtyard) of imperial mosques. Madrasas were generally limited to a main ground floor, and were often built as auxiliary buildings to a central mosque which anchored a &quot;külliye&quot; or charitable complex. This marked a certain departure from other madrasa styles as it emphasized the feeling of space for its own sake instead of focusing on the practical function of housing as many students as possible within a small area. This is evident in the &quot;külliye&quot; complex of Mehmet II Fatih, which included 16 madrasa buildings arranged symmetrically around the Fatih Mosque. The Süleymaniye complex, often considered the apogee of Ottoman architecture, included four madrasas as part of a vast and carefully designed architectural ensemble at the top of one of Istanbul&#x27;s highest hills.

==Madrasas by region==
===Ottoman Empire===

&quot;The first Ottoman Medrese was created in İznik in 1331 and most Ottoman medreses followed the traditions of Sunni Islam.&quot; &quot;When an Ottoman sultan established a new medrese, he would invite scholars from the Islamic world—for example, Murad II brought scholars from Persia, such as ʻAlāʼ al-Dīn and Fakhr al-Dīn who helped enhance the reputation of the Ottoman medrese&quot;. This reveals that the Islamic world was interconnected in the early modern period as they travelled around to other Islamic states exchanging knowledge. This sense that the Ottoman Empire was becoming modernised through globalization is also recognised by Hamadeh who says: &quot;Change in the eighteenth century as the beginning of a long and unilinear march toward westernisation reflects the two centuries of reformation in sovereign identity.&quot;
İnalcık also mentions that while scholars from for example Persia travelled to the Ottomans in order to share their knowledge, Ottomans travelled as well to receive education from scholars of these Islamic lands, such as Egypt, Persia and Turkestan. Hence, this reveals that similar to today&#x27;s modern world, individuals from the early modern society travelled abroad to receive education and share knowledge and that the world was more interconnected than it seems. Also, it reveals how the system of &quot;schooling&quot; was also similar to today&#x27;s modern world where students travel abroad to different countries for studies. Examples of Ottoman madrasas are the ones built by Muhammad the Conqueror. He built eight madrasas that were built &quot;on either side of the mosque where there were eight higher madrasas for specialised studies and eight lower medreses, which prepared students for these.&quot; The fact that they were built around, or near mosques reveals the religious impulses behind madrasa building and it reveals the interconnectedness between institutions of learning and religion. The students who completed their education in the lower medreses became known as danismends. This reveals that similar to the education system today, the Ottomans&#x27; educational system involved different kinds of schools attached to different kinds of levels. For example, there were lower madrasas and specialised ones, and for one to get into the specialised area meant that he had to complete the classes in the lower one in order to adequately prepare himself for higher learning.

This is the rank of madrasas in the Ottoman Empire from the highest ranking to the lowest: (From İnalcık, 167).
# Semniye
# Darulhadis
# Madrasas built by earlier sultans in Bursa.
# Madrasas endowed by great men of state.

Although Ottoman madrasas had a number of different branches of study, such as calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, they primarily served the function of an Islamic centre for spiritual learning. Often mentioned by critics that madrasas did not include a variety of natural sciences during the time of the Ottoman Empire, madrasas included curriculums that included a wide range of natural sciences. There were many well-known Muslim scholars, mathematicians, and scientists that all worked to teach high-ranking families and children of the sciences. it known that &quot;The goal of all knowledge and in particular, of the spiritual sciences is knowledge of God.&quot; Religion, for the most part, determines the significance and importance of each science. As İnalcık mentions: &quot;Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.&quot;
However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa&#x27;s curriculum, they were all primarily concerned with religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. &quot;The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths&quot; – key word being &quot;divine&quot;. İnalcık also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of Islam.&quot; Hence, madrasas – schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the Ottoman world. Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a pluralistic society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heavily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but rather Islamic in nature. Similarly, in Europe &quot;Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah.&quot; Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach &quot;proper religious values.&quot; This shows that in the early modern period, Ottomans and Europeans were similar in their ideas about how schools should be managed and what they should be primarily focused on. Thus, Ottoman madrasas were very similar to present day schools in the sense that they offered a wide range of studies; however, these studies, in their ultimate objective, aimed to further solidify and consolidate Islamic practices and theories.

====Curricula====
As is previously mentioned, religion dominated much of the knowledge and teachings that were endowed upon students. &quot;Religious learning as the only true science, whose sole aim was the understanding of God&#x27;s word.&quot;

The following is taken from İnalcık.

* A) Calligraphic sciences—such as styles of writing.
* B) Oral sciences—such as Arabic language, grammar and syntax.
* C) Intellectual sciences—logic in Islamic philosophy.
* D) Spiritual sciences—theoretical, such as Islamic theology and mathematics; and practical, such as Islamic ethics and politics.
====Social life and the medrese====
As with any other country during the Early Modern Period, such as Italy and Spain in Europe, the Ottoman social life was interconnected with the medrese. Medreses were built in as part of a Mosque complex where many programmes, such as aid to the poor through soup kitchens, were held under the infrastructure of a mosque, which reveals the interconnectedness of religion and social life during this period. &quot;The mosques to which medreses were attached, dominated the social life in Ottoman cities.&quot; Social life was not dominated by religion only in the Muslim world of the Ottoman Empire; it was also quite similar to the social life of Europe during this period. As Goffman says: &quot;Just as mosques dominated social life for the Ottomans, churches and synagogues dominated life for the Christians and Jews as well.&quot; Hence, social life and the medrese were closely linked, since medreses taught many curricula, such as religion, which highly governed social life in terms of establishing orthodoxy. &quot;They tried moving their developing state toward Islamic orthodoxy.&quot; Overall, the fact that mosques contained medreses comes to show the relevance of education to religion in the sense that education took place within the framework of religion and religion established social life by trying to create a common religious orthodoxy. Hence, medreses were simply part of the social life of society as students came to learn the fundamentals of their societal values and beliefs.

=== Maghreb ===

In northwestern Africa (the &quot;Maghrib&quot; or Maghreb), including Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, the appearance of madrasas was delayed until after the fall of the Almohad dynasty, who espoused a reformist doctrine generally considered unorthodox by other Sunnis. As such, it only came to flourish in the region in the 13th century, under the Marinid and Hafsid dynasties which succeeded them. In Tunisia (or Ifriqiya), the earliest Hafsid madrasa was the &quot;Madrasat al-Ma&#x27;raḍ&quot;, founded in Tunis in 1252 and followed by many others. In Morocco, the first madrasa was the Madrasa as-Saffarin built in Fes in 1271, followed by many others constructed around the country. The Marinids also built madrasas in Algeria, particularly in Tlemcen.

As elsewhere, rulers in the Maghreb built madrasas to bolster their political legitimacy and that of their dynasty. The Marinids used their patronage of madrasas to cultivate the loyalty of Morocco&#x27;s influential but independent religious elites and also to portray themselves to the general population as protectors and promoters of orthodox Sunni Islam. Madrasas also served to train the scholars and educated elites who generally operated the state bureaucracy. A number of madrasas also played a supporting role to major learning institutions like the older Qarawiyyin Mosque-University and the al-Andalusiyyin Mosque (both located in Fes) because they provided accommodations for students coming from other cities. Many of these students were poor, seeking sufficient education to gain a higher position in their home towns, and the madrasas provided them with basic necessities such as lodging and bread. However, the madrasas were also teaching institutions in their own right and offered their own courses, but usually with much narrower and more limited curriculums than the Qarawiyyin. The Bou Inania Madrasa in Fes, distinguished itself from other madrasas by its size and by being the only madrasa which also officially functioned as a public Friday mosque.

While some historical madrasas in Morocco remained in use well into the 20th century, most are no longer used for their original purpose following the reorganization of the Moroccan education system under French colonial rule and in the period following independence in 1956. Likewise, while some madrasas are still used for learning in Tunisia, many have since been converted to other uses in modern times.

===Iran===
Twelver Shi&#x27;ism has been the official religion of Iran since the Safavids declared it to be at the beginning of the 16th century, and the number of Shiʿite madrasas in Iran (or Persia) grew rapidly from that time on.
Since 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the head of state (&quot;Supreme Leader&quot;), has been a Twelver Shi&#x27;i faqih cleric. (&quot;The vast majority&quot; of the population is Twelver Shia Muslim. 
There are nearly three hundred thousand clerics in Iran&#x27;s seminaries.

====20th century====
Historically, its estimated that there were about 5,000 religious students in Iran/Persia in 1924–25, but, that number dropped sharply owing to the anticlerical policy of Reżā Shah (1925–41), and made a gradual comeback—though lagging behind growth of Iran&#x27;s population, &quot;between 1920 and 1979 the Persian population tripled ... but enrollment in madrasas only doubled&quot;—in the four decades before the revolution when his son (Mohammad Reza Pahlavi) ruled. At the biggest religious center in Iran, Qom, stipends for students came from religious taxes starting in the 1920s.

=== South Asia ===

====Afghanistan====
As of early 2021, Afghanistan had some 5000 madrasas registered with the Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs (unregistered ones being uncounted) with around 250 in Kabul, including the Darul-Ulom Imam Abu Hanifa which has 200 teachers and 3000 students, and in all, some 380,000 students were enrolled in these government recognized madrasas, including 55,000 girls.

====Bangladesh====
There are three different madrasa education systems in Bangladesh: the original darse nizami system, the redesigned nizami system, and the higher syllabus alia nisab. The first two categories are commonly called Qawmi or non-government madrasas. Amongst them the most notable are Al-Jamiatul Ahlia Darul Ulum Moinul Islam in Hathazari, Al-Jamiah Al-Islamiah Patiya, in Patiya, and Jamia Tawakkulia Renga Madrasah in Sylhet.In 2006 there were 15,000 registered Qawmi madrasas with the Befaqul Mudarressin of Bangladesh Qawmi Madrasah Education Board, though the figure could be well over double that number if unregistered madrasas were counted.

The madrasas regulated by the government through the Bangladesh Madrasah Education Board are called the Alia madrasas and they number some 7,000, offering, in addition to religious instruction, subjects such as English and science, and its graduates often complete their education in secular institutions, to the extent that some 32% of the university teachers in the humanities and the social sciences are graduates of these Alia madrasas.

====India====

In 2008, India&#x27;s madrassas were estimated to number between 8000 and 30,000, the state of Uttar Pradesh hosting most of them, estimated by the Indian government to have 10,000 of those back then.

The majority of these schools follow the Hanafi school of thought. The religious establishment forms part of the mainly two large divisions within the country, namely the Deobandis, who dominate in numbers (of whom the Darul Uloom Deoband constitutes one of the biggest madrasas) and the Barelvis, who also make up a sizeable portion (Sufi-oriented). Some notable establishments include: Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah (Isma&#x27;ilism), Al Jamiatul Ashrafia, Mubarakpur, Manzar Islam Bareilly, Jamia Nizamdina New Delhi, Jamia Nayeemia Muradabad which is one of the largest learning centres for the Barelvis. The HR ministry of the government of India has recently declared that a Central Madrasa Board would be set up. This will enhance the education system of madrasas in India. Though the madrasas impart Quranic education mainly, efforts are on to include Mathematics, Computers and science in the curriculum.

In July 2015, the state government of Maharashtra created a stir when it de-recognised madrasa education, receiving criticism from several political parties with the NCP accusing the ruling BJP of creating Hindu-Muslim friction in the state, and Kamal Farooqui of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board saying it was &quot;ill-designed&quot;
In March 2024, the Allahabad High Court in Uttar Pradesh declared the Madrasa Act of 2004 to be unconstitutional, according to a court order, while ordering the state government to move students enrolled in the Islamic system into mainstream schools. 

===== In Kerala =====
Most of the Muslims of Kerala follow the traditional Shāfiʿī school of religious law (known in Kerala as the traditionalist &#x27;Sunnis&#x27;) while a large minority follow modern movements that developed within Sunni Islam. The latter section consists of majority Salafists (the Mujahids) and the minority Islamists (political Islam).

* A &#x27;madrasa&#x27; in Kerala refers to an extra-curricular institution where children receive basic (Islamic) religious and Arabic language instruction.
* The so-called &#x27;Arabic Colleges&#x27; of Kerala are the equivalent of north Indian madrasas.

====Pakistan====
It is sometimes speculated that parents send their children to madrasas in Pakistan due to the inability to afford a good education. Although Madrasas are free they do provide adequate education for their students. It is sometimes speculated that due to lower quality of education those who finish have a hard time finding employment. Those who attended Madrasas have problem finding a job soon after. The education those receive madrasas in Pakistan closely resembles public institutions in the United States.
The madrasas rose as colleges of learning in the Islamic world in the 11th century, though there were institutions of learning earlier. They catered not only to the religious establishment, though that was the dominant influence over them, but also the secular one. To the latter they supplied physicians, administrative officials, judges and teachers. Today many registered madrasas are working effectively and coping up with modern education system such as Jamia-tul-Madina, which is a chain of Islamic schools in Pakistan and in European and other countries established by Dawat-e-Islami. The Jamia-tul-Madina are also known as Faizan-e-Madina. Dawat-e-Islami has grown its network of madrasas from Pakistan to Europe. In today&#x27;s time the most centralized location of madrasas is in Pakistan. Although Pakistan hold the most Madrasas the number is still growing in many different countries.

====Nepal====
Nepal has 907 madrasas recognized on the same level as government schools but the total number in the country is around 4000.

===Southeast Asia===
In Southeast Asia, Muslim students have a choice of attending a secular government or an Islamic school. Madrasas or Islamic schools are known as &quot;Sekolah Agama&quot; () in Malaysia and Indonesia, โรงเรียนศาสนาอิสลาม () in Thailand and &quot;madaris&quot; in the Philippines. In countries where Islam is not the majority or state religion, Islamic schools are found in regions such as southern Thailand (near the Thai-Malaysian border) and the southern Philippines in Mindanao, where a significant Muslim population can be found.

====Indonesia====
The number of madrasas more than doubled from 2002/2003 to 2011/2012, going from 63,000 to 145,000, unrecognized madrasas accounting for 17% of all schools in the country while the recognized madrasas account for nearly 1/3 of the secondary schools.

The word &quot;madrasah&quot; in Indonesia is also used to refer to secular-style public and private schools with more Islamic subjects in its curriculum. There are several levels of &quot;madrasah&quot;: &quot;Madrasah Ibtidaiyah&quot; (MI, the equivalent of elementary school), &quot;Madrasah Tsanawiyah&quot; (MTs, the equivalent of junior high school), &quot;Madrasah Aliyah&quot; (MA, the equivalent of senior high school), and &quot;Madrasah Aliyah Kejuruan&quot; (MAK, the equivalent of vocational high school).

====Singapore====
In Singapore, madrasahs are private schools which are overseen by Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS, &quot;Islamic Religious Council of Singapore&quot;). There are six Madrasahs in Singapore, catering to students from Primary 1 to Secondary 4 (and junior college equivalent, or &quot;Pre-U&quot;, at several schools). Four Madrasahs are coeducational and two are for girls. Students take a range of Islamic Studies subjects in addition to mainstream MOE curriculum subjects and sit for the PSLE and GCE &#x27;O&#x27; Levels like their peers. In 2009, MUIS introduced the &quot;Joint Madrasah System&quot; (JMS), a joint collaboration of Madrasah Al-Irsyad Al-Islamiah primary school and secondary schools Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah (offering the &quot;ukhrawi&quot;, or religious stream) and Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah (offering the academic stream). The JMS aims to introduce the International Baccalaureate (IB) programme into the Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah by 2019. Students attending a madrasah are required to wear the traditional Malay attire, including the songkok for boys and tudong for girls, in contrast to mainstream government schools which ban religious headgear as Singapore is officially a secular state. Students who wish to attend a mainstream school may opt to take classes on weekends at the &quot;madrasah&quot; instead of enrolling full-time.

====Philippines====

According to a 2006 International Religious Freedom Report of the US State Department the country has some 2000 madrasas, with half of them located in Mindanao.

In 2004, madrasas were mainstreamed in 16 Regions nationwide, primarily in Muslim-majority areas in Mindanao under the auspices of the Department of Education (DepEd). The DepEd adopted &quot;Department Order No. 51&quot;, which instituted Arabic-language and Islamic Values instruction for Muslim children in state schools, and authorised implementation of the Standard Madrasa Curriculum (SMC) in private-run madrasas. While there are state-recognised Islamic schools, such as Ibn Siena Integrated School in the Islamic City of Marawi, Sarang Bangun LC in Zamboanga and SMIE in Jolo, their Islamic studies programmes initially varied in application and content.

Since 2005, the AusAID-funded DepEd project Basic Education Assistance for Mindanao (BEAM) has assisted a group of private madrasas seeking a Permit To Operate from the government and implement the SMC. These private madrasas are scattered throughout Davao Region, Soccsksargen and the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).

In Bangsamoro, which succeeded the ARMM, the eligibility of Madrasa teachers are covered by the autonomous region&#x27;s education code. Prospect teachers barring any exception will have to take special examinations organized by the region&#x27;s education ministry in order to secure their eligibility.

====South Africa====
In South Africa, the madrasas also play a social and cultural role in giving after-school religious instruction to children of Muslims who attend government or private non-religious schools. However, substantial numbers of Muslim children attend fully-fledged private Islamic schools, which combine secular and religious education. Among Muslims of Indian origin, madrasas also used to provide instruction in Urdu, although this is far less common today than it used to be.

The first Madressa established in North America, Al-Rashid Islamic Institute, was established in Cornwall, Ontario in 1983 and has graduates who are Hafiz (Quran) and Ulama. The seminary was established by Mazhar Alam under the direction of his teacher the leading Indian Tablighi scholar Muhammad Zakariya Kandhlawi and focuses on the Hanafi school of thought. Due to its proximity to the US border city of Messina the school has historically had a high ratio of US students. Their most prominent graduate Shaykh Muhammad Alshareef completed his Hifz in the early 1990s then went on to form the AlMaghrib Institute.

====United States====
On May 26, 2012, Congressman André Carson of Indiana called for additional madrasas in the United States. There is a madrassa in Queens, NY called Shia Ithna-Asheri Jamaat of New York. Presently, the Darul Uloom in New York City, an affiliate of Darul Uloom Haqqania in Pakistan, also serves as a madrassa.

==Common misconceptions==
In the Arabic language, the word &quot;madrasa&quot; (مدرسه) means any educational institution, of any description, (as does the term &quot;school&quot; in American English) and does not imply a political or religious affiliation, not even one as broad as Islam in the general sense. Madrasas often have varied curricula. A large misconception is that madrasas only focused on the study of religion which is not true. Madrasas often included many different topics in their curriculum. Some madrasas in India, for example, have a secularised identity. Although early madrasas were founded primarily to gain &quot;knowledge of God&quot; they also taught subjects such as mathematics and poetry. For example, in the Ottoman Empire, &quot;Madrasahs had seven categories of sciences that were taught, such as: styles of writing, oral sciences like the Arabic language, grammar, rhetoric, and history and intellectual sciences, such as logic.&quot; This is similar to the Western world, in which the evolution of universities began with Christian cathedral schools and monastic schools.

The Yale Center for the Study of Globalization examined bias in United States newspaper coverage of Pakistan since the September 11, 2001 attacks, and found the term has come to contain a loaded political meaning:

When articles mentioned &quot;madrassas,&quot; readers were led to infer that all schools so-named are anti-American, anti-Western, pro-terrorist centres having less to do with teaching basic literacy and more to do with political indoctrination.

Various American public figures in the early 2000s used the word in a negative manner, including Newt Gingrich,
Donald Rumsfeld, and Colin Powell.
&quot;The New York Times&quot; published in January 2007 a correction for misusing the word &quot;madrassa&quot; in a way that assumed it meant a radical Islamic school. The correction stated:
An article [...] about a pointed exchange [...] over a Web site report that said Senator Barack Obama had attended an Islamic school or madrassa in Indonesia as a child referred imprecisely to madrassas. While some [madrassas] teach a radical version of Islam, most historically have not.There are many other instances where attempts to deem madrasas as just radical Islamic schools were made. In the year 2000, an article from &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, authored by university professor Jessica Stern, claimed that specifically Pakistani madrasas were responsible for the development of thousands of jihadists/terrorists, and that they were essentially weapons of mass destruction. During the time of the article&#x27;s release, videos surfaced of young boys intensely memorizing/studying the Quran, thus facilitating the false stereotype that madrasas brainwash and breed children to becoming future jihadists. This stereotype was even further accentuated following the events of 9/11. After this event, the United States implemented a plan to force Pakistan to completely shut down all madrasas that have links to militant groups, and to persuade madrasa students to instead attend public schools. Such a reaction and belief of the ties between Pakistan&#x27;s madrasas and militancy were especially prominent during these times, and even in modern-day society to a similar extent, due to false assumptions regarding the roles of madrasas in upbringing militant groups, the prevalence of enrollment in such institutions, and more. To touch more on the prevalence of enrollment in Pakistan&#x27;s madrasas, a 2005 study by Andrabi and others could be looked at. According to the study&#x27;s results, seventy-five percent of all households that send one child to a madrasa also tended to incorporate public and private schools for the education of the rest of their children (Those who were not sent to a madrasa). Therefore, only twenty-five percent of all households relied solely on madrasas for the education of all their children. When taking this into account, one can see that enrollment in madrasas is not as prevalent as many people would assume due to parental choice being a strong deciding factor.

<text>The first USS &quot;Chicago&quot; (later CA-14) was a protected cruiser of the United States Navy, the largest of the original three authorized by Congress for the &quot;New Navy&quot; and one of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first four steel ships.

She was launched on 5 December 1885 by Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works of Chester, Pennsylvania, sponsored by Edith Cleborne (daughter of Navy Medical Director Cuthbert J. Cleborne) and commissioned on 17 April 1889.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Chicago&quot; was ordered as part of the &quot;ABCD&quot; ships, the others being the cruisers and and the dispatch vessel . These were the first steel-hulled ships of the &quot;New Navy&quot;. All were ordered from the same shipyard, Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works of Chester, Pennsylvania. However, when Secretary of the Navy William C. Whitney initially refused to accept &quot;Dolphin&quot;, claiming her design was defective, the Roach yard went bankrupt and &quot;Chicago&quot;″s completion was delayed about three years while Roach reorganized as the Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works. Like the other &quot;ABCD&quot; ships, &quot;Chicago&quot; was built with a sail rig to increase cruising range.

&quot;Chicago&quot; was built with a displacement of at an overall length of and at the perpendiculars. Her beam was with a draft of . She had fourteen 100psi boilers that ran two compound overhead beam steam engines that producing to turn her two screws and achieve a speed of . She was also rigged with sails as a barque. &quot;Chicago&quot; was capable of carrying of coal.

&quot;Chicago&quot;″s original armament consisted of four /30 caliber Mark 2 guns, eight /30 caliber Mark 2 guns, two /31 caliber Mark 1 guns, two 6-pounder guns, four 3-pounder guns, two 1-pounder Hotchkiss revolver cannon, and two .45 caliber (11.4 mm) Gatling guns.

She had of armor on her gun shields, on her deck, and on her conning tower.

===Rebuilds and refits===
In 1895–99 &quot;Chicago&quot; was refitted at the New York Navy Yard, with her main batteries replaced by four new /35 caliber Mark 4 guns, and with all secondary 6-inch and 5-inch guns replaced by fourteen new /40 caliber Mark 3 guns. She had her sails removed, boilers replaced by six Babcock &amp; Wilcox and four cylindrical boilers, and engines replaced with two horizontal triple-expansion engines totaling for speed. In 1902 she was partially reconstructed, with an extended armored deck and increased displacement of . In 1915 as a training ship she was rearmed with twelve /40 caliber guns, and in 1918 as a flagship with four /51 caliber guns. In 1920, as a submarine tender at Pearl Harbor, she was disarmed.

==Service history==

===Pre-World War I===
On 7 December 1889, &quot;Chicago&quot; departed Boston for Lisbon, Portugal, arriving on 21 December. The cruiser served in European and Mediterranean waters as the flagship of the Squadron of Evolution until 31 May 1890, when she sailed from Funchal, Madeira to call at Brazilian and West Indian ports before returning to New York on 29 July.

&quot;Chicago&quot; operated along the east coasts of North and South America and in the Caribbean as flagship of the Squadron of Evolution—and later as flagship of the North Atlantic Squadron—until 1893. After taking part in the International Naval Review in Hampton Roads in April, she left New York on 18 June 1893 to cruise in European and Mediterranean waters as flagship of the European station. During this period the ship was commanded by Alfred Thayer Mahan, already famous as a naval strategist. &quot;Chicago&quot; returned to New York on 20 March 1895, and was placed out of commission there on 1 May.

Recommissioned on 1 December 1898, &quot;Chicago&quot; made a short cruise in the Caribbean before sailing for the European Station on 18 April. She returned to New York on 27 September and participated in the naval parade and Dewey celebration of 2 October 1899. &quot;Chicago&quot; sailed from New York on 25 November for an extended cruise, as flagship of the South Atlantic Station until early July 1901, then as flagship of the European Station. With the squadron, she cruised in northern European, Mediterranean, and Caribbean waters until 1 August 1903, when she proceeded to Oyster Bay, New York, and the Presidential Review.

From 3 December 1903 – 15 August 1904, &quot;Chicago&quot; was out of commission at Boston undergoing repairs. After operating along the northeast coast, the cruiser departed Newport News on 17 November for Valparaíso, Chile, arriving on 28 December. There, on 1 January 1905, she relieved the armored cruiser as flagship of the Pacific Squadron and for three years operated off the west coasts of North and South America, in the Caribbean, and to Hawaii. In 1906, she played a key role in the evacuation of San Francisco during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Arriving from San Diego at 6pm on 19 April, &quot;Chicago&quot;&#x27;s radio allowed the city&#x27;s leadership to communicate with the outside world, as telephone and telegraph lines were down. A group of two officers and sixteen enlisted men from &quot;Chicago&quot; supervised waterborne evacuation efforts. The removal of 20,000 refugees to Tiburon in Marin County by this ship and numerous other vessels is said to be unparalleled and unsurpassed until the 1940 evacuation of Dunkirk.

On 8 January 1908, &quot;Chicago&quot; departed San Diego for the east coast and in May joined the Naval Academy Practice Squadron for the summer cruise along the northeast coast until 27 August, when she went into reserve. &quot;Chicago&quot; was recommissioned the next summer (14 May – 28 August 1909) to operate with the Practice Squadron along the east coast, then returned to Annapolis. On 4 January 1910, she left the Academy for Boston, arriving on 23 January. She then served &quot;in commission in reserve&quot; with the Massachusetts Naval Militia until 12 April 1916, and with the Pennsylvania Naval Militia from 26 April 1916 – April 1917.

===World War I and beyond===
On 6 April 1917, &quot;Chicago&quot; was placed in full commission at Philadelphia and reported to Submarine Force, Atlantic (COMSUBLANT) as flagship at New London, Connecticut, commanded by future Admiral Thomas C. Hart. On 10 July 1919, she departed New York to join Cruiser Division 2 (CruDiv 2), as flagship in the Pacific. She was reclassified CA-14 in 1920 and then CL-14 in 1921. From December 1919 – September 1923, she served with SubDiv 14 and as tender at the Naval Submarine Base Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Chicago&quot; was decommissioned at Pearl Harbor on 30 September 1923 and served as a receiving ship at Naval Submarine Base Pearl Harbor until 1935. On 16 July 1928 she was renamed &quot;Alton&quot; to free the name &quot;Chicago&quot; for the heavy cruiser and was reclassified as an &quot;unclassified miscellaneous unit&quot; (IX-5).

&quot;Alton&quot; was sold on 15 May 1936. She foundered in mid-Pacific on 8 July 1936 while being towed from Honolulu to San Francisco for delivery to her buyers.

<text>In mathematics, an empty sum, or nullary sum, is a summation where the number of terms is zero. 
The natural way to extend non-empty sums is to let the empty sum be the additive identity.

Let formula_1, formula_2, formula_3, ... be a sequence of numbers, and let
:formula_4
be the sum of the first &quot;m&quot; terms of the sequence. This satisfies the recurrence
:formula_5
provided that we use the following natural convention: formula_6.
In other words, a &quot;sum&quot; formula_7 with only one term evaluates to that one term, while a &quot;sum&quot; formula_8 with no terms evaluates to 0.
Allowing a &quot;sum&quot; with only 1 or 0 terms reduces the number of cases to be considered in many mathematical formulas. Such &quot;sums&quot; are natural starting points in induction proofs, as well as in algorithms. For these reasons, the &quot;empty sum is zero&quot; extension is standard practice in mathematics and computer programming (assuming the domain has a zero element).
For the same reason, the empty product is taken to be the multiplicative identity.

For sums of other objects (such as vectors, matrices, polynomials), the value of an empty summation is taken to be its additive identity.

=== Empty linear combinations ===
In linear algebra, a basis of a vector space &quot;V&quot; is a linearly independent subset &quot;B&quot; such that every element of &quot;V&quot; is a linear combination of &quot;B&quot;.
The empty sum convention allows the zero-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot;={0} to have a basis, namely the empty set.

<text>The War Powers Resolution (also known as the War Powers Resolution of 1973 or the War Powers Act) () is a federal law intended to check the U.S. president&#x27;s power to commit the United States to an armed conflict without the consent of the U.S. Congress. The resolution was adopted in the form of a United States congressional joint resolution. It provides that the president can send the U.S. Armed Forces into action abroad only by declaration of war by Congress, &quot;statutory authorization&quot;, or in case of &quot;a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces&quot;.

The bill was introduced by Clement Zablocki, a Democratic congressman representing Wisconsin&#x27;s 4th district. The bill had bipartisan support and was co-sponsored by a number of U.S. military veterans. The War Powers Resolution requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action and forbids armed forces from remaining for more than 60 days, with a further 30-day withdrawal period, without congressional authorization for use of military force (AUMF) or a declaration of war by the United States. The resolution was passed by two-thirds each of the House and Senate, overriding the veto of President Richard Nixon.

It has been alleged that the War Powers Resolution has been violated in the past. However, Congress has disapproved all such incidents, and no allegations have resulted in successful legal actions taken against a president.

==Background==
Under the United States Constitution, war powers are divided. Under Article I, Section 8, Congress has the power to:

*declare war
*grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal (i.e., license private citizens to capture enemy vessels)
*raise and support Armies (for terms up to two years at a time)
*provide and maintain a Navy
*make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces
*provide for calling forth the Militia
*make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water
*provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia; and
*govern such Part of [the militia] as may be employed in the Service of the United States.

Section 8 further provides that the states have the power to:

*Appoint the Officers of the Militia; and
*train the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.

Article II, Section 2 provides that:

*&quot;The president shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States&quot;

It is generally agreed that the commander-in-chief role gives the President power to repel attacks against the United States and makes the President responsible for leading the armed forces. The President has the right to sign or veto congressional acts, such as a declaration of war, and Congress may override any such presidential veto. Additionally, when the president&#x27;s actions (or inactions) provide &quot;Aid and Comfort&quot; to enemies or levy war against the United States, then Congress has the power to impeach and remove (convict) the president for treason. For actions short of treason, they can remove the president for &quot;Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;, the definition of which the Supreme Court has left up to Congress. Therefore, the war power was intentionally split between Congress and the Executive to prevent unilateral executive action that is contrary to the wishes of Congress, and require a super-majority for legislative action that is contrary to the wishes of the president. Past presidential administrations have engaged the U.S. in conflict as well as directed U.S. military efforts without the approval of Congress. President Franklin Roosevelt directed the U.S. Navy to protect British shipping vessels during WW2 as well as ordering the occupation of Greenland and Iceland.

==History==

===Background and passage===

During the Vietnam War, the United States found itself involved for many years in situations of intense conflict without a declaration of war. Many members of Congress became concerned with the erosion of congressional authority to decide when the United States should become involved in a war or the use of armed forces that might lead to war. It was prompted by news leaking out that President Nixon conducted secret bombings of Cambodia during the Vietnam War without notifying Congress. The War Powers Resolution bill was a contest between Congress and the Presidency on who has specific rights regarding wartime authorities. According to the committee report “The issue concerns the &quot;twilight zone&quot; of concurrent authority which the Founding Fathers gave the Congress and the President over the war powers of the National Government.” 

President Nixon&#x27;s opposition to the bill was noted by Representative Gerald R. Ford, who read aloud a telegram from the President in which Nixon warned he would veto the legislation due to its &quot;dangerous and unconstitutional restrictions.&quot; The War Powers Resolution was passed by both the House of Representatives and Senate but was vetoed by President Richard Nixon. By a two-thirds vote in each house, Congress overrode the veto and enacted the joint resolution into law on November 7, 1973.

=== Provisions ===
The President is to submit a report in writing at least 48 hours prior to notifying the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate the reasons necessary for U.S. armed forces being introduced, the constitutional and legislative right in which such introduction took place, and the estimated scope and length of the involvement in the conflict. The President is to routinely consult with Congress until U.S. armed forces are no longer engaged in hostilities or have been removed. Reports are given to the House Committee of Foreign Affairs and to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

===Implementation, 1993–2002===
With the War Powers Resolution’s passing, both the deployment of troops to conflict and the stationing of troops past 60 days would now need prior congressional approval. The president would now need to routinely consult with Congress for the duration of the conflict. The resolution is considered to be a critically important bill in reestablishing congressional capabilities. Presidents have submitted 130 reports to Congress as a result of the War Powers Resolution, although only one (the &quot;Mayagüez&quot; incident) cited Section 4(a)(1) and specifically stated that forces had been introduced into hostilities or imminent danger.

Congress invoked the War Powers Resolution in the Multinational Force in Lebanon Act (P.L. 98-119), which authorized the Marines to remain in Lebanon for 18 months during 1982 and 1983. In addition, the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 1991 (), which authorized United States combat operations against Iraqi forces during the 1991 Gulf War, stated that it constituted specific statutory authorization within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution.

On November 9, 1993, the House used a section of the War Powers Resolution to state that U.S. forces should be withdrawn from Somalia by March 31, 1994; Congress had already taken this action in appropriations legislation. More recently, under President Clinton, war powers were at issue in former Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, and Haiti, and under President George W. Bush in responding to terrorist attacks against the U.S. after September 11, 2001. &quot;[I]n 1999, President Clinton kept the bombing campaign in Kosovo going for more than two weeks after the 60-day deadline had passed. Even then, however, the Clinton legal team opined that its actions were consistent with the War Powers Resolution because Congress had approved a bill funding the operation, which they argued constituted implicit authorization. That theory was controversial because the War Powers Resolution specifically says that such funding does not constitute authorization.&quot; Clinton&#x27;s actions in Kosovo were challenged by a member of Congress as a violation of the War Powers Resolution in the D.C. Circuit case &quot;Campbell v. Clinton&quot;, but the court found the issue was a non-justiciable political question. It was also accepted that because Clinton had withdrawn from the region 12 days prior the 90-day required deadline, he had managed to comply with the act.

After the 1991 Gulf War, the use of force to obtain Iraqi compliance with United Nations resolutions, particularly through enforcement of Iraqi no-fly zones, remained a war powers issue. In October 2002 Congress enacted the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq , which authorized President George W. Bush to use force as necessary to defend the United States against Iraq and enforce relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions. This was in addition to the Authorization for Use of Military Force of 2001.

===Libya, 2011===

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified to congress in March 2011 that the Obama administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya or for further decisions about it, despite congressional objections from members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution. During that classified briefing, she reportedly indicated that the administration would sidestep the Resolution&#x27;s provision regarding a 60-day limit on unauthorized military actions. Months later, she stated that, with respect to the military operation in Libya, the United States was still flying a quarter of the sorties, and the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that, while many presidents had bypassed other sections of the War Powers Resolution, there was little precedent for exceeding the 60-day statutory limit on unauthorized military actions – a limit which the Justice Department had said in 1980 was constitutional. The State Department publicly took the position in June 2011 that there was no &quot;hostility&quot; in Libya within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution, contrary to legal interpretations in 2011 by the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel.

May 20, 2011, marked the 60th day of US combat in Libya (as part of the UN resolution) but the deadline arrived without President Obama seeking specific authorization from the US Congress. President Obama notified Congress that no authorization was needed, since the US leadership had been transferred to NATO, and since US involvement was somewhat &quot;limited&quot;. In fact, as of April 28, 2011, the US had conducted 75 percent of all aerial refueling sorties, supplied 70 percent of the operation&#x27;s intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, and contributed 24 percent of the total aircraft used in the operation. By September, the US had conducted 26 percent of all military sorties, contributing more resources to Operation Unified Protector than any other NATO country. The State Department requested (but never received) express congressional authorization.

On Friday, June 3, 2011, the US House of Representatives voted to rebuke President Obama for maintaining an American presence in the NATO operations in Libya, which they considered a violation of the War Powers Resolution. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, an opinion piece by Yale Law Professor Bruce Ackerman stated that Obama&#x27;s position &quot;lacks a solid legal foundation. And by adopting it, the White House has shattered the traditional legal process the executive branch has developed to sustain the rule of law over the past 75 years.&quot;

===Syria, 2012–2017===

In late 2012 or early 2013, at the direction of U.S. President Barack Obama, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was put in charge of Timber Sycamore, a covert program to arm and train the rebels who were fighting against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while the State Department supplied the Free Syrian Army with non-lethal aid. Following the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Civil War on several occasions, including the Ghouta chemical attack on 21 August 2013, Obama asked Congress for authorization to use military force in Syria, which Congress rejected. Instead, Congress passed a bill that specified that the Defense Secretary was authorized &quot;...to provide assistance, including training, equipment, supplies, and sustainment, to appropriately vetted elements of the Syrian opposition and other appropriately vetted Syrian groups and individuals...&quot; The bill specifically prohibited the introduction of U.S. troops or other U.S. forces into hostilities. The bill said: &quot;Nothing in this section shall be construed to constitute a specific statutory authorization for the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities or into situations wherein hostilities are clearly indicated by the circumstances.&quot;

In spite of the prohibition, Obama, and later U.S. President Donald Trump, introduced ground forces into Syria, and the United States became fully engaged in the country, though these troops were primarily for training allied forces. On April 6, 2017, the United States launched 59 BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles at Shayrat airbase in Syria in response to Syria&#x27;s alleged use of chemical weapons. Constitutional scholar and law professor Stephen Vladeck has noted that the strike potentially violated the War Powers Resolution.

===Yemen, 2018–2019===

In 2018, Senators Bernie Sanders (I–VT), Chris Murphy (D–CT), and Mike Lee (R–UT) sponsored a bill to invoke the War Powers Resolution and to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, which has resulted in thousands of civilian casualties and &quot;millions more suffering from starvation and disease.&quot;

Sanders first introduced the bill in the 115th Congress in February 2018, but the Senate voted to table the motion in March 2018. Interest grew in the bill after the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018, with the Senate also approving a resolution holding Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman responsible for Khashoggi&#x27;s death. The Senate voted 56-to-41 to invoke the War Powers Resolution in December 2018. However, the House of Representatives did not vote on the resolution before the conclusion of the 115th Congress.

The bill was introduced in the 116th Congress in January 2019 with Sanders announcing a vote to take place on March 13, 2019. The bill was approved by the Senate in a 54–46 vote and was approved by the House of Representatives 247–175.

The bill was vetoed by President Trump on April 16, 2019. On May 2, 2019, the Senate failed to reach the two-thirds majority vote in order to override the veto.

===Iran, 2020===

On January 4, 2020, the White House officially notified Congress that it had carried out a fatal drone strike against Iranian General Qasem Soleimani a day earlier. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the entire document was classified and that it &quot;raises more questions than it answers.&quot; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would set up a classified briefing for all senators.

Senator Tim Kaine (D–VA) had already introduced a resolution to prevent the U.S. Armed Forces or any part of the government to use hostilities against Iran. Senator Bernie Sanders (I–VT) and Representative Ro Khanna (D–CA) introduced an anti-funding resolution, also on January 3.

The Trump Administration stated that the attack on Qasem Soleimani was carried out in accordance with the War Powers Resolution under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) resolution of 2002. The legalities of using the AUMF for endless conflicts has been a source of debate.

On February 13, 2020, the Senate passed a similar legally-binding privileged resolution by a vote of 55–45. Trump vetoed the Senate resolution on May 6, 2020, stating the resolution mistakenly &quot;implies that the president&#x27;s constitutional authority to use military force is limited to defense of the United States and its forces against imminent attack.&quot; Kaine stated Trump&#x27;s veto could enable &quot;endless wars&quot; and &quot;unnecessary war in the Middle East&quot;. The Senate attempted to override the veto the following day. The attempt need at least 67 votes to override, with it failing by a vote of 49–44.

==Questions regarding constitutionality==

The War Powers Resolution has been controversial since it was passed. In passing the resolution, Congress specifically cites the Necessary and Proper Clause for its authority. Under the Necessary and Proper Clause, it is specifically provided that the Congress shall have the power to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution, not only its own powers but also all other powers vested by the Constitution in the &quot;Government of the United States&quot;, or in &quot;any department or officer&quot; thereof.

There is controversy over whether the War Powers Resolution&#x27;s constraints on the President&#x27;s authority as Commander-in-Chief are consistent with the Constitution. Presidents have therefore drafted reports to Congress required of the President to state that they are &quot;consistent with&quot; the War Powers Resolution rather than &quot;pursuant to&quot; so as to take into account the presidential position that the resolution is unconstitutional.

One argument for the unconstitutionality of the War Powers Resolution by Philip Bobbitt argues &quot;The power to make war is not an enumerated power&quot; and the notion that to &quot;declare&quot; war is to &quot;commence&quot; war is a &quot;contemporary textual preconception&quot;. Bobbitt contends that the Framers of the Constitution believed that statutory authorization was the route by which the United States would be committed to war, and that &#x27;declaration&#x27; was meant for only total wars, as shown by the history of the Quasi-War with France (1798–1800). In general, constitutional powers are not so much separated as &quot;linked and sequenced&quot;; Congress&#x27;s control over the armed forces is &quot;structured&quot; by appropriation, while the President commands; thus the act of declaring war should not be fetishized. Bobbitt also argues that &quot;A democracy cannot ... tolerate secret policies&quot; because they undermine the legitimacy of governmental action.

A second argument concerns a possible breach of the &#x27;separation of powers&#x27; doctrine, and whether the resolution changes the balance between the Legislative and Executive functions.
This type of constitutional controversy is similar to one that occurred under President Andrew Johnson with the Tenure of Office Act (1867). In that prior instance, the Congress passed a law (over the veto of the then-President) that required the President to secure Congressional approval for the removal of Cabinet members and other executive branch officers. The Act was not declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States until 1926. When Andrew Johnson violated the Act, the House of Representatives impeached him; action in the Senate to remove him failed by one vote during his impeachment trial.

Here, the separation of powers issue is whether the War Powers Resolution requirements for Congressional approval and presidential reporting to Congress change the constitutional balance established in Articles I and II, namely that Congress is explicitly granted the sole authority to &quot;declare war&quot;, &quot;make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces&quot; (Article 1, Section 8), and to control the funding of those same forces, while the Executive has inherent authority as Commander in Chief. This argument does not address the other reporting requirements imposed on other executive officials and agencies by other statutes, nor does it address the provisions of Article I, Section 8 that explicitly gives Congress the authority to &quot;make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces&quot;.

The constitution specifically states that Congress is authorized &quot;to provide and maintain a Navy&quot; (Article 1 Section 8). The idea of &quot;maintenance&quot; of a Navy implies that Naval Forces would be a permanent fixture of national defense. Two types of Land Forces are described by the Constitution (Article 1 Section 8): the Militia (armed citizenry organized into local defense forces and state volunteer regiments) which Congress can &quot;call forth&quot; and prescribe the &quot;organizing, arming, and disciplining [training]&quot; of, as Congress did in the Militia acts of 1792; and the Army, which Congress can &quot;raise and support&quot;, through regular appropriation acts limited to no more than two years. This division matches how the Revolutionary War was fought, by the Continental Army, raised and supported by the Continental Congress, and local Militias and Volunteer Regiments, raised by the separate Colonies. After the war, under the Articles of Confederation, a small standing Army, the First American Regiment was raised and gradually increased in size over time by Congress before, following the Constitution&#x27;s ratification, being transformed into the Regular Army. The availability of a standing Army, and the President of the United States being authorized as &quot;Commander in Chief&quot;, implies his ability as a military commander to employ forces necessary to fulfill his oath to defend the constitution.

There is also an unresolved legal question, discussed by Justice White in &quot;INS v. Chadha&quot; of whether a &quot;key provision of the War Powers Resolution&quot;, namely 50 U.S.C. 1544(c), constitutes an improper legislative veto. (See &quot;Chadha&quot;, 462 U.S. 919, 971.) That section 1544(c) states &quot;such forces shall be removed by the President if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution&quot;. Justice White argues in his dissent in &quot;Chadha&quot; that, under the &quot;Chadha&quot; ruling, 1544(c) would be a violation of the Presentment Clause. The majority in &quot;Chadha&quot; does not resolve the issue. Justice White does not address or evaluate in his dissent whether that section would fall within the inherent Congressional authority under Article I Section 8 to &quot;make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces&quot;. A post-&quot;Chadha&quot; argument for the constitutionality of the concurrent resolution is that the War Powers Resolution does not delegate legislative authority to the President, and that the &quot;Chadha&quot; ruling applies only when Congress seeks to revoke a delegation of its authority.

A hearing was held before the Subcommittee on Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, United States Senate, on June 6, 2018, on war powers and the effects of unauthorized military engagements on federal spending. The witnesses giving testimony before the subcommittee were law professors Andrew Napolitano and Jonathan Turley, and Christopher Anders of the ACLU.

<doc id="209771" wikidata="Q7914748" url="?curid=209771" title="Vang Tao Incident">
<text>The Vang Tao Incident occurred on 3 July 2000, when a group of armed insurgents and mercenaries attacked a Lao customs outpost at the southern border town of Vang Tao. The raiders, as they came to be described, were easily routed leaving six of their own dead and 27 were arrested by Thai authorities. Of those, 11 were Thai nationals.

The attack followed a series of bombings in Vientiane attributed to Hmong rebels and coincided with a month-long lobbying visit by Prince Sauryavong Savang and Crown Prince Soulivong Savang to the United States. Some analysts concluded that the raid was likely a demonstration to gain financial and political support from Laotians abroad.

<text>Soulivong Savang (; born 8 May 1963), grandson of the last King of Laos Savang Vatthana, is the pretender to the Lao throne. Laos was a monarchy until 1975, when the communist Pathet Lao seized control of the nation, causing Savang Vatthana to abdicate his throne. Soulivong Savang lives in exile in Paris.

== Biography ==
Soulivong Khantharinh was born on 8 May 1963 at the Royal Palace in Luang Prabang to Crown Prince Vong Savang and Crown Princess Mahneelai of the Kingdom of Laos.

After the communist revolution, some members of the royal family were placed in re-education camps where they reportedly died, although Prince Souphanouvong later became President of the newly established republic. Prince Khantharinh escaped from captivity in Laos with his younger brother Prince Thayavong Savang in 1981, arriving in France as refugees.

==Education==

Soulivong Savang attended the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France and also obtained a law degree.

==Political aspirations==

He has been working to restore democracy as well as &quot;social and charitable reforms&quot; to Laos. &quot;The restoration of the monarchy would be up to the Lao people&quot;, he said. His uncle Prince Sauryavong Savang was regarded as head of the Laotian royal family and acted as regent to his nephew. A Royal Lao Government in Exile exists.

On 19 September 1997, Soulivong Khantharinh and his Uncle Prince Sauryavong Khantharinh initiated a Royal Lao Conference in Seattle, United States. Over five hundred Lao exiles and representatives of the Hmong, Kmu, Mien, Thaidam and all ethnic minority community attended. This conference established the Lao Representative Abroad Council.

On 19 September 1999, a second conference was held in Montreal, Canada, to follow up the progress of LRAC work and focus on non-profit organizations to support the local and worldwide community through community development, social services, education and job development, promoting cultural activity. Soulivong capitalized on the rise in royalist sentiment in neighbouring Thailand.

The Laotian exile community – 100,000 in France, 40,000 in Australia and half a million in the United States – has been fractured ethnically between Lao and Hmong. The crown prince said he tells both groups that a constitutional monarchy is their best hope of unity.

==Personal life==
On 10 November 2007, the Prince married Princess Chansouk Soukthala. The ceremony, which took place in Canada, was attended by 800 guests. The bride, Princess Chansouk, is a daughter of the former military Prosecutor Prince Tanh Soukthala and Princess Bounchanh Soukthala.

<doc id="209791" wikidata="Q4118210" url="?curid=209791" title="Million Book Project">
<text>The Million Book Project (or the Universal Library) was a book digitization project led by Raj Reddy at Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science and University Libraries from 2001 to 2008. Working with government and research partners in India (Digital Library of India) and China, the project scanned books in many languages, using OCR to enable full text searching, and providing free-to-read access to the books on the web. , they have completed the scanning of 1 million books and have made the entire catalog accessible online.

==Description==
The &quot;Million Book Project&quot; was a 501(c)(3) charity organization with various scanning centers throughout the world.

By December 2007, more than 1.5 million books had been scanned, in 20 languages: 970,000 in Chinese; 360,000 in English; 50,000 in Telugu; and 40,000 in Arabic. Most of the books are in the public domain, but permission has been acquired to include over 60,000 copyrighted books (roughly 53,000 in English and 7,000 in Indian languages). The books are mirrored in part at sites in India, China, Carnegie Mellon, the Internet Archive, Bibliotheca Alexandrina. The books that have been scanned to date are not yet all available online, and no single site has copies of all the books that are available online.

The million book project was a &quot;proof of concept&quot; that has largely been replaced by HathiTrust, Google Book Search and the Internet Archive book scanning projects.

The Internet Archive may have some books that Google does not (e.g.: &quot;The Poems of Robert Frost&quot; published after the end of 1922).

The National Science Foundation (NSF) awarded Carnegie Mellon $3.63M over four years for equipment and administrative travel for the Million Book Project. India provided $25M annually to support language translation research projects. The Ministry of Education in China provided $8.46M over three years. The Internet Archive provided equipment, staff and money. The University of California, Merced Library funded the work to acquire copyright permission from U.S. publishers.

The program ended in 2008. The Internet Archive hosted an online symposium in 2021 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Million Book Project.

<doc id="209792" wikidata="Q7159952" url="?curid=209792" title="Pedro Sevcec">
<text>Pedro Ricardo Sevcec (born July 14, 1954) is a Uruguayan television personality and journalist best known as the former anchor of &quot;Noticiero Telemundo&quot; in the United States, from 2000 to 2009. Sevcec previously served as reporter for &quot;Ocurrio Asi&quot; before hosting his own talk show on the network. He currently hosts &quot;Sevcec&quot; on MegaTV since 2021 and has his own afternoon drive radio show on WSUA Miami- Radio Caracol 1260 AM called &quot;La Ventana con Pedro Sevcec&quot;.

==Early career==
Upon arriving to the United States, Sevcec started working as a correspondent for Spanish International Network. In 1986, Sevcec switched over to Telemundo, where he served as journalist and reporter for its network news. Sevcec served as co-anchor and reporter for &quot;Ocurrio Asi&quot; in 1993, alongside Enrique Gratas. He later hosted his own talk show, &quot;Sevcec&quot; which ran from 1994 to 1999, when it was replaced by &quot;Laura en America&quot;. Sevcec returned to &quot;Ocurrió Así&quot; as host for a brief period in 1999 after its original host Enrique Gratas left Telemundo that year.

==&quot;Noticiero Telemundo&quot;==
In 2000, Sevcec became the main anchor for &quot;Noticiero Telemundo&quot;, where he remained for the next nine years. During this time, he interviewed numerous presidents and world leaders, including then-president George W. Bush. In September 2001, he and Brit Hume of Fox News Channel were the only two journalists to attend President Bush&#x27;s first state dinner.

===Incidents===
On February 17, 2004, a bomb exploded in an Iraqi school where Sevcec was filming a report about the opening of the school, with no one being injured. He also survived a shooting between guerrillas and the military in El Salvador years before.

Sevcec was involved in the Los Angeles May Day Mêlée that took part on May 1, 2007. In video footage of the incident, Sevcec is seen running away from oncoming police officers just as his evening live broadcast was taking place. In an interview, he recounted how police were hitting women and children as they were running away.

===Departure from Telemundo===
On December 16, 2009, Telemundo announced that Pedro Sevcec was being replaced as anchor of the Noticiero Telemundo nightly newscast with Jose Diaz-Balart, a veteran anchor and reporter. The Miami Herald reported that Telemundo was replacing Sevcec as &quot;part of a big new push at Telemundo toward news integration -- not just between shows, but between the network&#x27;s broadcast, cable and digital operations as well.&quot;

In 2011, Sevcec joined WJAN-CD América Teve 41 and began hosting &quot;Sevcec A Fondo&quot;, until his 2021 departure and currently presents &quot;Sevcec&quot; on WSBS-TV Channel 48 and syndicated nationally via MegaTV.

<text>The National Digital Library Program (NDLP) is a project by the United States Library of Congress to assemble a digital library of reproductions of primary source materials to support the study of the history and culture of the United States. The NDLP brought online 24 million books and documents from the Library of Congress and other research institutions.

==History==
Begun in 1995 after a five-year pilot project, the program began digitizing selected collections of Library of Congress archival materials that chronicle the nation&#x27;s history. In order to reproduce collections of books, pamphlets, motion pictures, manuscripts and sound recordings, the Library has created a range of digital entities: bitonal document images, grayscale and color pictorial images, digital video and audio, and searchable e-texts. To provide access to the reproductions, the project developed a range of descriptive elements: bibliographic records, finding aids, and introductory texts and programs, as well as indexing the full texts for certain types of content.

The reproductions were produced with a variety of tools: image scanners, digital cameras, devices that digitize audio and video, and human labor for rekeying and encoding texts. American Memory employs national-standard and well established industry-standard formats for many digital reproductions, e.g., texts encoded with Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and images stored in Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files or compressed with the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) algorithm. In other cases, the lack of well established standards has led to the use of emerging formats, e.g., RealAudio (for audio), QuickTime (for moving images), and MrSID (for maps). Technical information by types of material and by individual collections is also available on the site.

The Library received funding from Congress and private sector donations, sponsoring a three-year competition to enable institutions like libraries to digitize their U.S. history collections.

<doc id="209798" wikidata="Q3608991" url="?curid=209798" title="Tigris–Euphrates river system">
<text>The Tigris–Euphrates river system is a large river system in Western Asia that flows into the Persian Gulf. Its primary rivers are the Tigris and Euphrates, along with smaller tributaries.

From their sources and upper courses in the Armenian highlands of eastern Turkey, being Lake Hazar for the Tigris and Karasu along with the Murat River for the Euphrates, the two rivers descend through valleys and gorges to the uplands of Syria and northern Iraq and then to the alluvial plain of central Iraq. Other tributaries join the Tigris from sources in the Zagros Mountains to the east. The rivers flow in a south-easterly direction through the central plain and combine at Al-Qurnah to form the Shatt al-Arab and discharge into the Persian Gulf. The rivers and their tributaries drain an area of , including almost the entire area of Iraq as well as portions of Turkey, Syria, Iran and Kuwait.

The region has historical importance as part of the Fertile Crescent, where Mesopotamian civilization first emerged.

==Geography==
The Tigris–Euphrates Basin is shared between Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Kuwait. Many tributaries of the Tigris river originate in Iran, and the Shatt al-Arab, formed by the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, makes up a portion of the Iran–Iraq border, with Kuwait&#x27;s Bubiyan Island being part of its delta. Since the 1960s and in the 1970s, when Turkey began the GAP project in earnest, water disputes have regularly occurred in addition to the associated dam&#x27;s effects on the environment. In addition, Syrian and Iranian dam construction has also contributed to political tension within the basin, particularly during drought.

The ecoregion is characterized by two large rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates. The high mountains in the upper watershed receive more rain and snow than the lower watershed, which has a hot and arid subtropical climate. Annual snow melt from the mountains brings spring floods, and sustains permanent and seasonal marshes in the lowlands.

The plain between the two rivers is known as Mesopotamia. As part of the larger Fertile Crescent, it saw the earliest emergence of literate urban civilization in the Uruk period. For this reason, it is often described as a &quot;Cradle of Civilization&quot;.

There is a large floodplain in the lower basin where the Euphrates, Tigris, and Karun rivers converge to create the Mesopotamian Marshes, which include permanent lakes, marshes, and riparian forests. The hydrology of these vast marshes is extremely important to the ecology of the entire upper Persian Gulf.

==History==
Some of the first civilizations emerged from the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. From ancient times empires arose and fell in the river basin, including Sumer, Akkad, Babylonia, Assyria, and the Abbasid Caliphate. Being part of the Fertile Crescent, the river system is recognized as the site of one of the world&#x27;s first agricultural centers, with archeological sites containing preserved grain dating up to 12,500 years ago. The river system was used by major cities including Ur and Babylon to promote trade and the sharing of cultures. As a result of its invention of the qanat system thousands of years ago which uses gravity to transport water through subterranean tunnels, Iran has a history as an agricultural nation, despite its aridity.

==Ecology==

The most abundant fishes are species of barbs (&quot;Barbus&quot;), some of which can reach up to two meters in length. Some species have been important food sources for residents for thousands of years. Specifically, the Mangar fish has been harvested for food in the Tigris-Euphrates basin. Many species move seasonally between the river and the marshes for spawning, feeding, and overwintering. The Hilsa shad (&quot;Tenualosa ilisha&quot;) is an important food fish that lives in the coastal waters and spawns in the lower reaches of the basin. Other ocean species occasionally visit the lower reaches of the rivers; bull sharks (&quot;Carcharhinus leucas&quot;) used to swim up the Tigris as far as Baghdad.

Endemic fish species in the lower basin include &quot;Glyptothorax steindachneri&quot; and &quot;Hemigrammocapoeta elegans&quot;, and as well as two cave fishes, &quot;Caecocypris basimi&quot; and the Iraq blind barb (&quot;Typhlogarra widdowsoni&quot;), from a cave habitat near Haditha on the Euphrates.

One-third of the fish species in the upper watersheds are endemic, including species of &quot;Aphanius, Glyptothorax, Cobitis, Orthrias&quot;, and &quot;Schistura&quot;. Two blind fish species, the Iran cave barb (&quot;Iranocypris typhlops&quot;) and the Zagros blind loach (&quot;Eidinemacheilus smithi&quot;), are endemic to cave systems in Iran&#x27;s upper Karun River watershed. The Batman River loach (&quot;Paraschistura chrysicristinae&quot;) is a Critically Endangered fish species endemic to the Batman and Ambar rivers, Turkish tributaries of the Tigris. The species is endangered by drought, habitat destruction, and habitat fragmentation from the construction of the Batman Dam. It had not been observed since 1974 and was feared extinct until a 2021 expedition netted 14 fish living above the Batman Dam.

===Mesopotamian Marshes===
The Mesopotamian Marshes in southern Iraq were historically the largest wetland ecosystem of Western Eurasia. The aquatic vegetation includes reeds, rushes, and papyrus, which support numerous species. Areas around the Tigris and the Euphrates are very fertile. Marshy land is home to water birds, some stopping here while migrating, and some spending the winter in these marshes living off the lizards, snakes, frogs, and fish. Other animals found in these marshes are water buffalo, two endemic rodent species, antelopes and gazelles and small animals such as the jerboa and several other mammals. The wetland birds Basra reed warbler (&quot;Acrocephalus griseldis&quot;) and Iraq babbler (&quot;Argya altirostris&quot;) are endemic to the Mesopotamian Marshes. The Basra reed warbler is endangered. Another wetland endemic species, Bunn&#x27;s short-tailed bandicoot rat (&quot;Nesokia bunnii&quot;), is possibly extinct.

Their drainage began in the 1950s, to reclaim land for agriculture and oil exploration. Saddam Hussein extended this work in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as part of ecological warfare against the Marsh Arabs, a rebellious group of people in Baathist Iraq. However, with the breaching of the dikes by local communities after the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the ending of a four-year drought that same year, the process has been reversed and the marshes have experienced a substantial rate of recovery. The permanent wetlands now cover more than 50% of pre-1970s levels, with a remarkable regrowth of the Hammar and Hawizeh Marshes and some recovery of the Central Marshes.

==Ecological threats==
Iraq suffers from desertification and soil salination due in large part to thousands of years of agricultural activity. Water and plant life are sparse. Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government water-control projects drained the inhabited marsh areas east of An Nasiriyah by drying up or diverting streams and rivers. Shi&#x27;a Muslims were displaced under the Ba&#x27;athist regime. The destruction of the natural habitat poses serious threats to the area&#x27;s wildlife populations. There are also inadequate supplies of potable water.

The marshlands were an extensive natural wetland ecosystem, which developed over thousands of years in the Tigris–Euphrates basin and once covered 15–20,000 square kilometers. In the 1980s, this ecoregion was put in grave danger during the Iran–Iraq War. After the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq&#x27;s President Saddam Hussein initiated a drainage project on these marshes, leading to degradation of ecosystem services that caused economic and social issues for civilians. The Mesopotamian Marshes, which were inhabited by the Marsh Arabs, were almost completely drained. Although they had started to recover after the fall of Ba&#x27;athist Iraq in 2003, drought, intensive dam construction and irrigation schemes upstream have caused them to dry up once more. According to the United Nations Environmental Program and the AMAR Charitable Foundation, between 84% and 90% of the marshes have been destroyed since the 1970s. In 1994, 60 percent of the wetlands were destroyed by Hussein&#x27;s regime – drained to permit military access and greater political control of the native Marsh Arabs. Canals, dykes and dams were built routing the water of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers around the marshes, instead of allowing water to move slowly through the marshland. After part of the Euphrates was dried up due to re-routing its water to the sea, a dam was built so water could not back up from the Tigris and sustain the former marshland. Some marshlands were burned and pipes buried underground helped to carry away water for quicker drying.

Riparian entities have constructed dams along the Tigris–Euphrates river system as a method of water management in response to droughts. Turkey, for example, is in control of an estimated 45% of the system&#x27;s water sources due to its dam constructions for water quantity and hydroelectric power.

The drying of the marshes led to the disappearance of the salt-tolerant vegetation; the plankton rich waters that fertilized surrounding soils; 52 native fish species; the wild boar, red fox, buffalo and water birds of the marsh habitat.

Climate change also affects the environmental and social well-being. Climate change and human interaction have directly impacted the Tigris–Euphrates river system, leading to a negative trend in water storage capabilities in the river basin. The combination of diminishing water levels in the Tigris–Euphrates river system and rising sea levels indicates the potential for rapid seawater intrusion in the river basin. This is especially concerning as the demand for clean water increases while the water supply decreases. Currently, the Middle East and North Africa are acknowledged as the most water scarce region in the world, with 61% of the population living in areas with high or very high water stress. As climate change worsens and population grows, water scarcity in the region is expected to worsen with 100% of people living in the Middle East and North Africa living in areas with high water stress by 2050.

==Water dispute==
The issue of water rights became a point of contention for Iraq, Turkey and Syria beginning in the 1960s when Turkey implemented a public-works project (the GAP project) aimed at harvesting the water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers through the construction of 22 dams, for irrigation and hydroelectric energy purposes. Although the water dispute between Turkey and Syria was more problematic, the GAP project was also perceived as a threat by Iraq. In 1983, the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) was established to solve ongoing data controversies between Turkey, Syria, and Iraq but stopped meeting in the early 1990s after only passing two bilateral agreements. The tension between Turkey and Iraq about the issue was increased by the effect of Syria and Turkey&#x27;s participation in the UN embargo against Iraq following the Gulf War. However, the issue had never become as significant as the water dispute between Turkey and Syria.

The 2008 drought in Iraq sparked new negotiations between Iraq and Turkey over trans-boundary river flows. Although the drought affected Turkey, Syria and Iran as well, Iraq complained regularly about reduced water flows. Iraq particularly complained about the Euphrates River because of the large number of dams on the river. Turkey agreed to increase the flow several times, beyond its means in order to supply Iraq with water. Iraq has seen significant declines in water storage and crop yields because of the drought. To make matters worse, Iraq&#x27;s water infrastructure has suffered from years of conflict and neglect.

In 2008, Turkey, Iraq and Syria agreed to restart the Joint Trilateral Committee on water for the three nations for better water resources management. Turkey, Iraq and Syria signed a memorandum of understanding on September 3, 2009, in order to strengthen communication within the Tigris–Euphrates Basin and to develop joint water-flow-monitoring stations. On September 19, 2009, Turkey formally agreed to increase the flow of the Euphrates River to 450 to 500 m3/s, but only until October 20, 2009. In exchange, Iraq agreed to trade petroleum with Turkey and help curb Kurdish militant activity in their border region. One of Turkey&#x27;s last large GAP dams on the Tigris – the Ilisu Dam – is strongly opposed by Iraq and is the source of political strife. The Southeastern Anatolia Project (Turkish acronym: GAP) continues to be a source of tension in the region. GAP is a massive hydroelectric project, consisting of 21 dams and 19 hydroelectric facilities. In 2020, Iraqi authorities complained that the Ilısu Dam had decreased the Tigris river inflows and caused water shortages in Iraqi plains.

<text>A Bantustan (also known as a Bantu homeland, a black homeland, a black state or simply known as a homeland; ) was a territory that the National Party administration of the Union of South Africa (1910–1961) and later the Republic of South Africa (1961–1994) set aside for black inhabitants of South Africa and South West Africa (now Namibia), as a part of its policy of apartheid.

The term, first used in the late 1940s, was coined from &quot;Bantu&quot; (meaning &quot;people&quot; in some of the Bantu languages) and &quot;-stan&quot; (a suffix meaning &quot;land&quot; in Persian and other Persian-influenced languages). It subsequently came to be regarded as a disparaging term by some critics of the apartheid-era government&#x27;s &quot;homelands&quot;. The Pretoria government established ten Bantustans in South Africa, and ten in neighbouring South West Africa (then under South African administration), for the purpose of concentrating the members of designated ethnic groups, thus making each of those territories ethnically homogeneous as the basis for creating autonomous nation states for South Africa&#x27;s different black ethnic groups. Under the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act of 1970, the government stripped black South Africans of their South African citizenship, depriving them of their few remaining political and civil rights in South Africa, and declared them to be citizens of these homelands.

The government of South Africa declared that four of the South African Bantustans were independent—Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei (the so-called &quot;TBVC States&quot;), but this declaration was never recognised by anti-apartheid forces in South Africa or by any international government. Other Bantustans (like KwaZulu, Lebowa, and QwaQwa) were assigned &quot;autonomy&quot; but never granted &quot;independence&quot;. In South West Africa, Ovamboland, Kavangoland, and East Caprivi were declared to be self-governing, with a handful of other ostensible homelands never being given autonomy. An Interim Constitution effectively abolished the Bantustans with the complete end of apartheid in South Africa in 1994.

== Creation ==
Beginning in 1913, successive white-minority South African governments established &quot;reserves&quot; for the black population in order to racially segregate them from the white population, similar to the creation of Indian reservations in the United States. The Natives Land Act, 1913, limited blacks to seven percent of the land in the country. In 1936 the government planned to raise this to 13.6 percent of the land, but it was slow to purchase land and this plan was not fully implemented.

When the National Party came to power in 1948, Minister for Native Affairs (and later Prime Minister of South Africa) Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd built on this, introducing a series of &quot;grand apartheid&quot; measures such as the Group Areas Acts and the Natives Resettlement Act, 1954 that reshaped South African society such that whites would be the demographic majority. The creation of the homelands or Bantustans was a central element of this strategy, as the long-term goal was to make the Bantustans independent. As a result, blacks would lose their South African citizenship and voting rights, allowing whites to remain in control of South Africa.

The term &quot;Bantustan&quot; for the Bantu homelands was intended to draw a parallel with the creation of Pakistan and India (&quot;Hindustan&quot;), which had taken place just a few months before at the end of 1947, and was coined by supporters of the policy. However, it quickly became a pejorative term, with the National Party preferring the term &quot;homelands&quot;. As Nelson Mandela explained in a 1959 article:
:The newspapers have christened the Nationalists&#x27; plan as one for &quot;Bantustans&quot;. The hybrid word is, in many ways, extremely misleading. It relates to the partitioning of India, after the reluctant departure of the British, and as a condition thereof, into two separate States, Hindustan and Pakistan. There is no real parallel with the Nationalists&#x27; proposals, for (a) India and Pakistan constitute two completely separate and politically independent States, (b) Muslims enjoy equal rights in India; Hindus enjoy equal rights in Pakistan, (c) Partition was submitted to and approved by both parties, or at any rate fairly widespread and influential sections of each. The Government&#x27;s plans do not envisage the partitioning of this country into separate, self-governing States. They do not envisage equal rights, or any rights at all, for Africans outside the reserves. Partition has never been approved of by Africans and never will be. For that matter it has never been really submitted to or approved of by the Whites. The term &quot;Bantustan&quot; is therefore a complete misnomer, and merely tends to help the Nationalists perpetrate a fraud.

The Afrikaner view was:
:&quot;While apartheid was an ideology born of the will to survive or, put differently, the fear of extinction, Afrikaner leaders differed on how best to implement it. While some were satisfied with segregationist policies placing them at the top of a social and economic hierarchy, others truly believed in the concept of &#x27;separate but equal&#x27;. For the latter, the ideological justification for the classification, segregation, and denial of political rights was the plan to set aside special land reserves for black South Africans, later called &#x27;bantustans&#x27; or &#x27;homelands&#x27;. Each ethnic group would have its own state with its own political system and economy, and each would rely on its own labour force. These independent states would then coexist alongside white South Africa in a spirit of friendship and collaboration. In their own areas, black citizens would enjoy full rights.&quot;

Verwoerd argued that the Bantustans were the &quot;original homes&quot; of the black peoples of South Africa. In 1951, the government of Daniel François Malan introduced the Bantu Authorities Act to establish &quot;homelands&quot; allocated to the country&#x27;s black ethnic groups. These amounted to 13% of the country&#x27;s land, the remainder being reserved for the white population. The homelands were run by cooperative tribal leaders, while uncooperative chiefs were forcibly deposed. Over time, a ruling black elite emerged with a personal and financial interest in the preservation of the homelands. While this aided the homelands&#x27; political stability to an extent, their position was still entirely dependent on South African support.

The role of the homelands was expanded in 1959 with the passage of the Bantu Self-Government Act, which set out a plan called &quot;Separate Development&quot;. This enabled the homelands to establish themselves in the long term as self-governing territories and ultimately as nominally fully &quot;independent&quot; states.

This process was to be achieved in a series of four major steps for each homeland:

* The unification of the reserves set aside for the various &quot;tribes&quot; (officially called &quot;nations&quot; since 1959) under a single &quot;Territorial Authority&quot;
* The establishment of a legislative assembly for each homeland with limited powers of self-rule
* The establishment of the homeland as a &quot;self-governing territory&quot;
* The granting of full nominal independence to the homeland

This general framework was not in each case followed in a clear-cut way, but often with a number of intermediate and overlapping steps.

The homeland of Transkei served in many regards as a &quot;testing ground&quot; for apartheid policies; its institutional development started already before the 1959 act, and its attainment of self-government and independence were therefore implemented earlier than for the other homelands.

This plan was stepped up under Verwoerd&#x27;s successor as prime minister, John Vorster, as part of his &quot;enlightened&quot; approach to apartheid. However, the true intention of this policy was to fulfill Verwoerd&#x27;s original plan to make South Africa&#x27;s blacks nationals of the homelands rather than of South Africa—thus removing the few rights they still had as citizens. The homelands were encouraged to opt for independence, as this would greatly reduce the number of black citizens of South Africa. The process of creating the legal framework for this plan was completed by the Black Homelands Citizenship Act of 1970, which formally designated all black South Africans as citizens of the homelands, even if they lived in &quot;white South Africa&quot;, and cancelled their South African citizenship, and the Bantu Homelands Constitution Act of 1971, which provided a general blueprint for the stages of constitutional development of all homelands (except Transkei) from the establishment of Territorial Authorities up to full independence.

By 1984, all ten homelands in South Africa had attained self-government and four of them (Transkei, Boputhatswana, Venda and Ciskei) had been declared fully independent between 1976 and 1981.

The following table shows the time-frame of the institutional and legal development of the ten South African Bantustans in light of the above-mentioned four major steps:
In parallel with the creation of the homelands, South Africa&#x27;s black population was subjected to a massive programme of forced relocation. It has been estimated that 3.5 million people were forced from their homes from the 1960s through the 1980s, many being resettled in the Bantustans.

The government made clear that its ultimate aim was the total removal of the black population from South Africa. Connie Mulder, the Minister of Plural Relations and Development, told the House of Assembly on 7 February 1978:

But this goal was not achieved. Only a minority (about 39% in 1986) of South Africa&#x27;s black population lived in the Bantustans; the remainder lived in South Africa proper, many in townships, shanty-towns and slums on the outskirts of South African cities.

==International recognition==
Bantustans within the borders of South Africa were classified as &quot;self-governing&quot; or &quot;independent&quot;. In theory, self-governing Bantustans had control over many aspects of their internal functioning but were not yet sovereign nations. Independent Bantustans (Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei; also known as the TBVC states) were intended to be fully sovereign. These areas received little attention from the colonial and later South African governments however, and were still very undeveloped. This greatly decreased these states&#x27; ability to govern and made them very reliant on the South African government.

Throughout the existence of the independent Bantustans, South Africa remained the only country to recognise their independence. The South African government lobbied for their recognition. In 1976, leading up to a United States House of Representatives resolution urging the President not to recognise Transkei, the South African government intensely lobbied lawmakers to oppose the bill. Arbitrary and unrecognized amateur radio call signs were created for the independent states and QSL cards were sent by operators using them, but the International Telecommunication Union never accepted these stations as legitimate. Each TBVC state extended recognition to the other independent Bantustans while South Africa showed its commitment to the notion of TBVC sovereignty by building embassies in the TBVC capitals.

==Life in the Bantustans==

The Bantustans were generally poor, with few local employment opportunities. However, some opportunities did exist for advancement for blacks and some advances in education and infrastructure were made. The four Bantustans which attained nominal independence (Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei) repealed all apartheid legislation.

Laws in the Bantustans differed from those in South Africa proper. The South African elite often took advantage of these differences, for example by constructing large casinos, such as Sun City in the homeland of Bophuthatswana.

Bophuthatswana also possessed deposits of platinum, and other natural resources, which made it the wealthiest of the Bantustans.

However, the homelands were only kept afloat by massive subsidies from the South African government; for instance, by 1985 in Transkei, 85% of the homeland&#x27;s income came from direct transfer payments from Pretoria. The Bantustans&#x27; governments were invariably corrupt and little wealth trickled down to the local populations, who were forced to seek employment as &quot;guest workers&quot; in South Africa proper. Millions of people had to work in often appalling conditions, away from their homes for months at a time. On the other hand, only 40% of Bophuthatswana&#x27;s population worked outside the &#x27;homeland&#x27; because the homeland was able to create industrial sites like Zone 15 and Babelegi.

The homelands were extremely unpopular among the urban black population, many of whom lived in squalor in slum housing. Their working conditions were often equally poor, as they were denied any significant rights or protections in South Africa proper. The allocation of individuals to specific homelands was often quite arbitrary. Many individuals were assigned to homelands they did not originate from, and the designation of an individual as part of a particular ethnic group was often arbitrary, especially for individuals with mixed ancestry. 

Bantustan leaders were widely perceived as collaborators with the apartheid system, although some were successful in acquiring a following. Most homeland leaders had an ambivalent stance regarding the independence of their homelands: a majority was sceptical, remained cautious and avoided a definite decision, some outright rejected it due to their rejection of &quot;separate development&quot; and a professed commitment to &quot;opposing apartheid from within the system&quot;, whilst others believed that nominal independence could serve to consolidate their power bases (to an even higher degree than the status they enjoyed as rulers of self-governing homelands) and presented an opportunity to build a society relatively free from racial discrimination. The leaders of the Bantustans, despite their collaboration with the apartheid regime, occasionally criticized the South African government&#x27;s racial policies and called for the repeal or softening of apartheid laws (most of which were repealed in nominally independent states). Various plans for a federal solution were at times mooted, both by the Bantustan governments and by opposition parties in South Africa as well as circles inside the white ruling National Party.

==Later developments==
In January 1985, State President P. W. Botha declared that blacks in South Africa proper would no longer be deprived of South African citizenship in favour of Bantustan citizenship and that black citizens within the independent Bantustans could reapply for South African citizenship; F. W. de Klerk stated on behalf of the National Party during the 1987 general election that &quot;every effort to turn the tide [of black workers] streaming into the urban areas failed. It does not help to bluff ourselves about this. The economy demands the permanent presence of the majority of blacks in urban areas... They cannot stay in South Africa year after year without political representation.&quot; In March 1990, de Klerk, who succeeded Botha as State President in 1989, announced that his government would not grant independence to any more Bantustans.

However, these remarks were not meant as a rejection of the Bantustan system in general: the goal of the apartheid regime during the second half of the 1980s was to &quot;modernize&quot; the organisational framework of apartheid while leaving its fundamental principles, including the homelands, unchanged.

The government was forced to accept the permanent presence of blacks in urban areas as well as the practical unfeasibility of the hitherto very strict forms of &quot;influx control&quot; (replacing it by &quot;softer&quot; means of control), not to mention the impossibility of a total removal of all blacks to the homelands even in the long run. It was hoping to &quot;pacify&quot; the black urban population by developing various plans to confer upon them limited rights at the local level (but not the upper levels of government). Furthermore, the urban (and rural) residential areas remained segregated based on race in accordance with the Group Areas Act.

&quot;Separate development&quot; as a principle remained in force, and the apartheid regime went on to rely on the Bantustans as one of the main pillars of its policy in dealing with the black population. Until 1990, attempts continued to urge self-governing homelands to opt for independence (e.g. Lebowa, Gazankulu and KwaZulu) and on occasion the governments of self-governing homelands (e.g. KwaNdebele) themselves expressed interest in obtaining eventual independence.

It was also contemplated in circles of the ruling National Party to create additional nominally independent entities in the urban areas in the form of &quot;independent&quot; black &quot;city-states&quot;.

The long-term vision during this time was the creation of some form of a multi-racial &quot;confederation of South African states&quot; with a common citizenship, but separated into racially defined areas. Plans were made (of which only very few were realised) for the development of different &quot;joint&quot; institutions charged with mutual consultation, deliberation and a number of executive functions in relation to &quot;general affairs&quot; common to all population groups, insofar as these institutions would pose no threat to apartheid and the preservation of overall white rule. This &quot;confederation&quot; would include the so-called &quot;common area&quot;—meaning the bulk of South African territory outside of the homelands—under continued white-minority rule and limited power-sharing arrangements with the segregated Coloured and Indian/Asian population groups, the independent and self-governing homelands as well as possible additional black entities in urban areas.

From 1990 to 1994, these &quot;confederational&quot; ideas were in principle still entertained by large parts of the National Party (and in various forms also by certain parties and groups of the white liberal opposition), but their overtly race-based foundations gradually became less pronounced in the course of the negotiations to end apartheid, and the focus shifted to securing &quot;minority rights&quot; (having in mind primarily the white population in particular) after an expected handover of power to the black majority. Federalist plans also met with support from some homeland governments and parties, most importantly the Inkatha Freedom Party, which was the ruling party of KwaZulu. But since especially the African National Congress made it clear that the principles of &quot;one man - one vote&quot; and a unitary state were non-negotiable, confederal schemes were eventually dropped. Because of this, the Inkatha Freedom Party threatened to boycott the April 1994 general election that ended apartheid and decided only in the last minute to participate in them after concessions had been made to them and as well as to the still-ruling National Party and several white opposition groups.

In the period leading up to the elections in 1994, several leaders in the independent and self-governing homelands (e.g. in Boputhatswana), who did not wish to relinquish their power, vehemently opposed the dismantling of the Bantustans and, in doing so, received support from white far-right parties, sections of the apartheid state apparatus and radical pro-apartheid groups like the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging.

==Dissolution==
With the demise of the apartheid regime in South Africa in 1994, all Bantustans (both nominally independent and self-governing) were dismantled and their territories reincorporated into the Republic of South Africa with effect from 27 April 1994 (the day on which the Interim Constitution, which formally ended apartheid, came into force and the first democratic elections began) in terms of and of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993 (&quot;Interim Constitution&quot;).

The drive to achieve this was spearheaded by the African National Congress (ANC) as a central element of its programme of reform. Reincorporation was mostly achieved peacefully, although there was some resistance from the local elites, who stood to lose out on the opportunities for wealth and political power provided by the homelands. The dismantling of the homelands of Bophuthatswana and Ciskei was particularly difficult. In Ciskei, South African security forces had to intervene in March 1994 to defuse a political crisis.

From 1994, most parts of the country were constitutionally redivided into new provinces.

Nevertheless, many leaders of former Bantustans or Homelands have had a role in South African politics since their abolition. Some had entered their own parties into the first non-racial election while others joined the ANC. Mangosuthu Buthelezi was chief minister of his KwaZulu homeland from 1976 until 1994. In post-apartheid South Africa he has served as president of the Inkatha Freedom Party and Minister of Home Affairs. Bantubonke Holomisa, who was a general in the homeland of Transkei from 1987, has served as the president of the United Democratic Movement since 1997. General Constand Viljoen, an Afrikaner who served as chief of the South African Defence Force, sent 1,500 of his militiamen to protect Lucas Mangope and to contest the termination of Bophuthatswana as a homeland in 1994. He founded the Freedom Front in 1994. Lucas Mangope, former chief of the Motsweda Ba hurutshe-Boo-Manyane tribe of the Tswana and head of Bophuthatswana is president of the United Christian Democratic Party, effectively a continuation of the ruling party of the homeland. Oupa Gqozo, the last ruler of Ciskei, entered his African Democratic Movement in the 1994 elections but was unsuccessful. The Dikwankwetla Party, which ruled Qwaqwa, remains a force in the Maluti a Phofung council where it is the largest opposition party. The Ximoko Party, which ruled Gazankulu, has a presence in local government in Giyani. Similarly, the former KwaNdebele chief minister George Mahlangu and others formed the Sindawonye Progressive Party which is one of the major opposition parties in Thembisile Hani Local Municipality and Dr JS Moroka Local Municipality (encompassing the territory of the former homeland).

==List of Bantustans==
===Bantustans in South Africa===
The homelands are listed below with the ethnic group for which each homeland was designated. Four were nominally independent (the so-called TBVC states of the Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and the Ciskei). The other six had limited self-government:

====Nominally independent states====

==== Self-governing entities====
The first Bantustan was the Transkei, under the leadership of Chief Kaiser Daliwonga Matanzima in the Cape Province for the Xhosa nation. KwaZulu, for the Zulu nation in the Province of Natal, was headed by a member of the Zulu royal family chief Mangosuthu (&quot;Gatsha&quot;) Buthelezi in the name of the Zulu king.

Lesotho and Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland) were not Bantustans; they have been independent countries and former British protectorates. These countries are mostly or entirely surrounded by South African territory and are almost totally dependent on South Africa. They have never had any formal political dependence on South Africa and were recognised as sovereign states by the international community from the time they were granted their independence by the UK in the 1960s.

===Bantustans in South West Africa===
====Homelands====

In the 1960s, South Africa, which was administering South West Africa under a League of Nations mandate, came under increased international pressure regarding its minority white rule over the majority black population. The solution envisaged by South Africa—the Odendaal Plan—was to separate the white and the non-white population, grant self-government to the isolated black territories, and thus make whites the majority population in the vast remainder of the country. Moreover, it was envisaged that, by separating each ethnic group and confining people by law to their restricted areas, discrimination by race would automatically disappear. The inspiration for the Odendaal Plan came, in part, from South African anthropologists.

The demarcated territories were called the &quot;bantustans&quot;, and the remainder of the land was called the &quot;Police Zone&quot;. Forthwith, all non-white people employed in the Police Zone became &quot;migrant workers&quot;, and pass laws were established to police movement in and out of the bantustans.

The combined territory of all bantustans was roughly equal in size to the Police Zone. However, all bantustans were predominantly rural and excluded major towns. All harbours, most of the railway network and the tarred road infrastructure, all larger airports, the profitable diamond areas and the national parks were situated in the Police Zone.

Beginning in 1968, following the 1964 recommendations of the commission headed by Fox Odendaal, ten homelands similar to those in South Africa were established in South West Africa (present-day Namibia). The term &quot;Bantustan&quot; is somewhat inappropriate in this context, since some of the peoples involved were Khoisan, not Bantu, and the Rehoboth Basters are a complex case. Of these ten South West African homelands, only three were granted self-government (comparable to the Bantustans in South Africa) between 1973 and 1976.

====Representative Authorities====
In July 1980, the system was changed to one of separate governments (&quot;representative authorities&quot;) as second-tier administrative units (responsible for a number of affairs like land tenure, agriculture, education up to the level of primary school teachers&#x27; training, health services and social welfare and pensions) on the basis of ethnicity only and no longer based on geographically defined areas. Building upon institutions that had already been in existence since 1925 and 1962, respectively, representative authorities were also instituted for the white and Coloured population groups. No such representative authorities were established for the Himba and San peoples (mainly occupying their former homelands of Kaokoland and Bushmanland).

These ethnic second-tier governments were &quot;de facto&quot; suspended in May 1989, at the start of the transition to independence, and &quot;de jure&quot; abolished on 21 March 1990 (the day Namibia became independent) in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Constitution of Namibia. The Basters lobbied unsuccessfully to maintain the autonomous status of Rehoboth, which had previously been autonomous under German rule, and Basterland. In the former Bantustan of East Caprivi, Lozi nationalists in 1999 launched an unsuccessful insurgency in an attempt to gain independence from Namibia.

The land in the Bantustan territories fell to the Namibian state, and is today called &quot;Communal Areas&quot;.

==== Homelands (until 1980) / Representative Authorities (1980–1989/1990)====
==Usage in non-South African contexts==
The term &quot;bantustan&quot; has become a generic term to refer in a disapproving sense to any area in which people are forced to live without full civil and political rights.

===Palestinian enclaves===
In the Middle East, the Palestinian enclaves in the West Bank, as well as the Gaza Strip, are often described as bantustans by critics of Israel&#x27;s policies in the Palestinian territories. The term is used to refer to either the proposed areas in the West Bank designated for Palestinians under a variety of U.S. and Israeli-led proposals to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, or the existing 165 &quot;islands&quot; which first took official form as Areas A and B under the 1995 Oslo II Accord. The Israeli-U.S. peace plans, including the Allon Plan, the Drobles World Zionist Organization plan, Menachem Begin&#x27;s plan, Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s &quot;Allon Plus&quot; plan, the 2000 Camp David Summit, and Sharon&#x27;s vision of a Palestinian state have proposed an enclave-type territory, as has the more recent Trump peace plan. This has been criticized as the &quot;Bantustan option&quot;.

===Other examples===
In the Indian subcontinent, the Sinhalese government of Sri Lanka has been accused of turning Tamil areas into &quot;bantustans&quot;. The term has also been used to refer to the living conditions of Dalits in India.

In Nigeria, Catholic bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah has referred to southern Kaduna State as &quot;one huge Bantustan of government neglect.&quot;

In Canada and the United States, Indian reserves and Indian reservations are often compared to Bantustans due to the shared relationship between the countries&#x27; systems of racial segregation.

<text>The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is the joint committee between ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29 and ITU-T Study Group 16 that created and maintains the JPEG, JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, JPEG XT, JPEG XS, JPEG XL, and related digital image standards. It also has the responsibility for maintenance of the JBIG and JBIG2 standards that were developed by the former Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group.

Within ISO/IEC JTC 1, JPEG is Working Group 1 (WG 1) of Subcommittee 29 (SC 29) and has the formal title &quot;JPEG Coding of digital representations of images&quot;, where it is one of eight working groups in SC 29. In the ITU-T (formerly called the CCITT), its work falls in the domain of the ITU-T Visual Coding Experts Group (VCEG), which is Question 6 of Study Group 16. 

JPEG has typically held meetings three or four times annually in North America, Asia and Europe. The chairman of JPEG (termed its &quot;Convenor&quot; in ISO/IEC terminology) is Prof. Touradj Ebrahimi of École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, who previously had led JPEG 2000 development within the JPEG committee and also had a leading role in MPEG-4 standardization.

== History ==
In April 1983, ISO started to work to add photo quality graphics to text terminals. In the mid-1980s, both the CCITT (now ITU-T) and ISO had standardization groups for image coding: CCITT Study Group VIII (SG8) – &quot;Telematic Services&quot; and ISO TC97 SC2 WG8 – &quot;Coding of Audio and Picture Information&quot;. They were historically targeted on image communication. The JPEG committee was created in 1986 and the Joint (CCITT/ISO) Bi-level Image Group (JBIG) was created in 1988.

Former chairs of JPEG include Greg Wallace of Digital Equipment Corporation and Daniel Lee of Yahoo. Fumitaka Ono of Tokyo Polytechnic University was chair of the former JBIG group that has since been merged into JPEG.

== Standards published and under development ==
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is Working Group 1 of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29, titled &quot;JPEG Coding of digital representations of images&quot; (working as a joint team with ITU-T SG 16). It has developed various standards, which have been published by ITU-T and/or ISO/IEC. The standards developed by the JPEG (and former JBIG) sub-groups are referred to as a joint development of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 1 and ITU-T SG16. The JPEG standards typically consist of different Parts in ISO/IEC terminology. Each Part is a separate document that covers a certain aspect of a suite of standards that share a project number, and the Parts can be adopted separately as individual standards or used together. For the JPEG standards that are published jointly with ITU-T, each ISO/IEC Part corresponds to a separate ITU-T Recommendation (i.e., a separate standard). Once published, JPEG standards have also often been revised by later amendments and/or new editions e.g., to add optional extended capabilities or improve the editorial quality of the specifications. Standards developed and under development by JPEG are shown in the table below.

<doc id="209811" wikidata="Q192623" url="?curid=209811" title="Looting">
<text>Looting is the act of stealing, or the taking of goods by force, typically in the midst of a military, political, or other social crisis, such as war, natural disasters (where law and civil enforcement are temporarily ineffective), or rioting. The proceeds of all these activities can be described as booty, loot, plunder, spoils, or pillage.

Looting by a victorious army during war has been a common practice throughout recorded history. In the wake of the Napoleonic Wars and particularly after World War II, norms against wartime plunder became widely accepted. In modern armed conflicts, looting is prohibited by international law, and constitutes a war crime.

==After disasters==
During a disaster, police and military forces are sometimes unable to prevent looting when they are overwhelmed by humanitarian or combat concerns, or they cannot be summoned because of damaged communications infrastructure. Especially during natural disasters, many civilians may find themselves forced to take what does not belong to them in order to survive. How to respond to that and where the line between unnecessary &quot;looting&quot; and necessary &quot;scavenging&quot; lies are often dilemmas for governments. In other cases, looting may be tolerated or even encouraged by governments for political or other reasons, including religious, social or economic ones.

== History ==

=== In armed conflict ===
Looting by a victorious army during war has been a common practice throughout recorded history. Foot soldiers viewed plunder as a way to supplement an often-meagre income and transferred wealth became part of the celebration of victory. In the wake of the Napoleonic Wars and particularly after World War II, norms against wartime plunder became widely accepted.

In the upper ranks, the proud exhibition of the loot plundered formed an integral part of the typical Roman triumph, and Genghis Khan was not unusual in proclaiming that the greatest happiness was &quot;to vanquish your enemies... to rob them of their wealth&quot;.

In ancient times, looting was sometimes prohibited due to religious concerns. For example, King Clovis I of the Franks, forbade his soldiers to loot when they campaigned near St Martin&#x27;s shrine in Tours, for fear of offending the saint.

In warfare in ancient times, the spoils of war included the defeated populations, which were often enslaved. Women and children might become absorbed into the victorious country&#x27;s population, as concubines, eunuchs and slaves. In other pre-modern societies, objects made of precious metals were the preferred target of war looting, largely because of their ease of portability. In many cases, looting offered an opportunity to obtain treasures and works of art that otherwise would not have been obtainable. Beginning in the early modern period and reaching its peak in the New Imperialism era, European colonial powers frequently looted areas they captured during military campaigns against non-European states. In the 1930s, and even more so during the Second World War, Nazi Germany engaged in large-scale and organized looting of art and property, particularly in Nazi-occupied Poland.

Looting, combined with poor military discipline, has occasionally been an army&#x27;s downfall since troops who have dispersed to ransack an area may become vulnerable to counter-attack, a good example being during the 1967 First Invasion of Onitsha, where the victorious Nigerian troops were encircled and annihilated while looting. In other cases, for example, the Wahhabi sack of Karbala in 1801 or 1802, loot has contributed to further victories for an army. Not all looters in wartime are conquerors; the looting of Vistula Land by the retreating Imperial Russian Army in 1915 was among the factors sapping the loyalty of Poles to Russia. Local civilians can also take advantage of a breakdown of order to loot public and private property, as took place at the Iraq Museum in the course of the Iraq War in 2003. Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy&#x27;s novel &quot;War and Peace&quot; describes widespread looting by Moscow&#x27;s citizens before Napoleon&#x27;s troops entered the city in 1812, along with looting by French troops elsewhere.

In 1990 and 1991, during the Gulf War, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s soldiers caused significant damage to both Kuwaiti and Saudi infrastructure. They also stole from private companies and homes. In April 2003, looters broke into the National Museum of Iraq, and thousands of artefacts remain missing.

Syrian conservation sites and museums were looted during the Syrian Civil War, with items being sold on the international black market. Reports from 2012 suggested that the antiquities were being traded for weapons by the various combatants.

==== Prohibited under international law ====
Both customary international law and international treaties prohibit pillage in armed conflict. The Lieber Code, the Brussels Declaration (1874), and the Oxford Manual have recognized the prohibition against pillage. The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 (modified in 1954) obliges military forces not only to avoid the destruction of enemy property but also to provide for its protection. Article 8 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court provides that in international warfare, &quot;pillaging a town or place, even when taken by assault&quot;, is a war crime. In the aftermath of World War II, a number of war criminals were prosecuted for pillage. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (1993–2017) brought several prosecutions for pillage.

The Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 explicitly prohibits the looting of civilian property during wartime.

Theoretically, to prevent such looting, unclaimed property is moved to the custody of the Custodian of Enemy Property, to be handled until returned to its owners.

==== Modern conflicts ====

Despite international prohibitions against the practice of looting, the ease with which it can be done means that it remains relatively common, particularly during outbreaks of civil unrest during which rules of war may not yet apply. The 2011 Egyptian Revolution, for example, caused a significant increase in the looting of antiquities from archaeological sites in Egypt, as the government lost the ability to protect the sites. Other acts of modern looting, such as the looting and destruction of artifacts from the National Museum of Iraq by Islamic State militants, can be used as an easy way to express contempt for the concept of rules of war altogether.

In the case of a sudden change in a country or region&#x27;s government, it can be difficult to determine what constitutes looting as opposed to a new government taking custody of the property in question. This can be especially difficult if the new government is only partially recognized at the time the property is moved, as was the case during the 2021 Taliban offensive, during which a number of artifacts and a large amount of property of former government officials who had fled the country fell into the hands of the Taliban before they were recognized as the legitimate government of Afghanistan by other countries. Further looting and burning of civilian homes and villages has been defended by the Taliban as within their right as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.

Looting can also be common in cases where civil unrest is contained largely within the borders of a country or during peacetime. Riots in the wake of the 2020 George Floyd protests in numerous American cities led to increased amounts of looting, as looters took advantage of the delicate political situation and civil unrest surrounding the riots themselves. Up to 175 Target stores closed Nationwide during the disturbances.

During the ongoing Kashmir conflict, looting of Kashmiris trapped between the Indian and Pakistani militarized zones is common and widespread.

In 2022, international observers accused Russia of engaging in large scale looting during the Russo-Ukrainian War, reporting the widespread looting of everything from food to industrial equipment. Despite the publication of numerous photos and videos by Ukrainian journalists and civilians, numerous Russian commanders have denied these claims. International observers have theorized that this looting is either the result of direct orders, despite to Russia&#x27;s claims to the contrary, or due to Russian soldiers not being issued with adequate food and other resources by their commanders.

==Archaeological removals==

The term &quot;looting&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to antiquities being removed from countries by unauthorized people, either domestic people breaking the law seeking monetary gain or foreign nations, which are usually more interested in prestige or previously, &quot;scientific discovery&quot;. An example might be the removal of the contents of Egyptian tombs that were transported to museums across the West.

==Looting of industry==
As part of World War II reparations, Soviet forces systematically plundered the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, including the Recovered Territories, which later transferred to Poland. The Soviets sent valuable industrial equipment, infrastructure and whole factories to the Soviet Union.

Many factories in the rebels&#x27; zone of Aleppo during the Syrian Civil War were reported as being plundered and their assets transferred abroad. Agricultural production and electronic power plants were also seized, to be sold elsewhere.

<text>Go-go is a subgenre of funk music with an emphasis on specific rhythmic patterns, and live audience call and response.

Go-go was originated by African-American musicians in Washington, D.C., during the mid-1960s to late-1970s. Go-go has limited popularity in other areas, but maintains a devoted audience in the Washington metropolitan area as a uniquely regional music style and was named the official music of Washington, D.C., in February 2020.

Performers associated with the development of the style include Rare Essence, EU, Trouble Funk, and singer-guitarist Chuck Brown. 
Modern artists like Charles &quot;Shorty Corleone&quot; Garris continue the go-go tradition in D.C.

==Description==

In technical terms, &quot;go-go&#x27;s essential beat is characterized by a five through four syncopated rhythm that is underscored prominently by the bass drum and snare drum, and the hi-hat... [and] is ornamented by the other percussion instruments, especially by the conga drums, rototoms, and hand-held cowbells.&quot;

Unique to go-go is instrumentation with two standard congas and two junior congas, 8&quot; and 9&quot; wide and about half as tall as the standard congas, a size rare outside go-go. They were introduced to Rare Essence by Tyrone &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot; Williams in the early days when they couldn&#x27;t afford full-sized congas and are ubiquitous ever since. Its name arises from the persistent percussive beat, but it incorporates elements of many other genres.

==Origins==
Although Chuck Brown is known as &quot;the Godfather of Go-Go&quot;, go-go is a musical movement that cannot be traced back to one single person, as there were so many bands that flourished during the beginning of this era that they collectively created the sound that is recognized as go-go of today. Artists such as Marvin Gaye, Van McCoy, Billy Stewart, Peaches &amp; Herb, Black Heat, Experience Unlimited (E.U.), Vernon Burch, Sir Joe Quarterman &amp; the Free Soul, the Moments, Ray, Goodman &amp; Brown, True Reflection, the Unifics, Terry Huff &amp; Special Delivery, Act 1, the Dynamic Superiors, Skip Mahoney &amp; the Casuals, the Choice Four, and the Fuzz that played soul music during pre-go-go era.

The term &quot;gogo&quot; (as it applies to a music venue) originated in France in the early 1960s, at the Whiskyagogo nightclub, named after the French title for the British comedy &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot;. The club also featured go-go dancers. In January 1964, capitalizing on the emerging popularity of &quot;go-go dancers&quot;, the name was licensed to a Los Angeles club, the Whisky a Go Go, and from there the term &quot;go-go&quot; spread nationwide. The Cafe Au Go Go in NYC was also in business during that time, gaining notoriety when Lenny Bruce was arrested there in April 1964. By 1965, &quot;go-go&quot; was a recognized word for a music club, as evidenced by the TV show &quot;Hollywood A Go-Go&quot; (march 1965-1966), or the song title of that year&#x27;s hit &quot;Going to a Go-Go&quot; by Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles (released November 1965). At a go-go club, dancers could expect to hear the latest top 40 hits, performed by local bands and DJ&#x27;s. (The French Whiskyagogo had been one of the first venues in the world to replace live music with records selected by a disc jockey.)

In Washington D.C., minor group the Young Senators were formed in 1965, beginning a fierce competition with Chuck Brown and Black Heat on the local club circuit. The Young Senators later became known for their song &quot;Jungle&quot; released in 1970 by Innovation Records.

Chuck Brown was a fixture on Washington and Maryland music scene with his band Los Lotinos as far back as 1966. By the mid-1970s, he had changed the group&#x27;s name to The Soul Searchers, and developed a laid-back, rhythm-heavy style of funk performed with one song blending into the next (in order to keep people on the dance floor). The beat was based on Grover Washington Jr.&#x27;s song &quot;Mr. Magic,&quot; though Brown has said in interviews that both he and Washington had adapted the beat from a gospel music beat found in black churches.

Washington, D.C., funk&#x27;s early national chart action came when Black Heat (the first D.C. go-go band to be signed by a major record label) released their Billboard top 100 hit &quot;No Time To Burn&quot; from their second album on Atlantic Records in 1974. They then toured with such national acts as Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Parliament-Funkadelic, Ohio Players, The Commodores, and others. In 1976, James Funk, a young DJ who spun at clubs in between Soul Searchers sets, was inspired (and encouraged by Brown himself) to start a band—called Rare Essence (originally the Young Dynamos)—that played the same kind of music.

==History==
Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers released their first go-go hit &quot;Bustin&#x27; Loose&quot; in late 1978; it reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs R&amp;B charts and held that position for a month during February and March 1979 (peaking at #34 on the Pop chart).

Experience Unlimited (a.k.a. E.U.) who originally formed in 1974 was a band more influenced by rock (their name a nod to the Jimi Hendrix Experience), that started out in the 1970s. After witnessing Rare Essence in the late-1970s, they modified their style to incorporate the go-go beat. Kurtis Blow&#x27;s &quot;Party Time&quot; subsequently put them on the map to be later tracked down by Grace Jones and to take the King of Go-Go Production, Maxx Kidd to an international music adventure with Island Records, to make E.U.&#x27;s greatest hit &quot;Da Butt&quot; for the soundtrack of the 1988 film &quot;School Daze&quot;, written, directed and produced by Spike Lee.

Trouble Funk had its roots in the early 1970s Top 40 cover band called Trouble Band, then fronted by drummer, Emmett Nixon. With the inclusion of Robert &#x27;Dyke&#x27; Reed (keyboards, guitar, vocals), Taylor Reed (trumpet, vocals), James Avery (keyboards, vocals), Teebone David (percussion), and Tony Fisher (bass, vocals), the band changed its name, and, in the late 1970s, after seeing the light at a gig they played with Chuck Brown, they, too, adopted the go-go beat. The band was signed to the Sugar Hill Records label in 1982 and recorded with Kurtis Blow. Trouble Funk recorded the go-go anthem &quot;Hey, Fellas.&quot;

===1980s===
In the 1980s, some go-go bands such as Chuck Brown, Trouble Funk, EU, Rare Essence, Hot Cold Sweat, The Junk Yard Band, AM/FM, Redds and the Boys, Slug-Go achieved local success. Trouble Funk put out a few records on New Jersey–based label Jamtu before signing with one of the more powerful hip hop labels, Sugar Hill, where it released a six-track LP called &quot;Drop the Bomb&quot; in 1982, which included the hit &quot;Pump Me Up&quot; which had already been a regional hit years before. Maxx Kidd founded go-go label T.T.E.D. Records in 1982.

In 1984, Island Records founder Chris Blackwell heard Chuck Brown&#x27;s &quot;We Need Some Money&quot; on the radio in New York, which ultimately led to him signing some of the brightest stars of the go-go scene. Trouble Funk and E.U. were both signed to Island, while Chuck Brown, Redds and the Boys and Hot, Cold, Sweat were signed through a distribution deal between Max Kidd&#x27;s T.T.E.D. and Island subsidiary 4th &amp; B&#x27;way.

Along with the recording contracts Blackwell was handing out, he also wanted to make the go-go film and soundtrack; a D.C.-based version of &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;. The resultant film, &quot;Good to Go&quot; (or &quot;Short Fuse&quot;, as it was called on video) was plagued with problems: co-director Don Letts was let go halfway through production, the film became less about the music and more about drugs and violence, and despite the fact that most of the post-production was completed in the fall of 1985, the film was held for release until late-summer 1986. When it did poorly on release, it seemed that go-go had missed its best chance to break into the mainstream. &quot;Good to Go&quot; OST album was released in 1986 also. Soul/Funk groups used go-go beat in their songs. Examples of R&amp;B were Club Nouveau &quot;Lean on Me&quot;(pop No. 1, yearend No. 10) Lebert &quot;Casanova&quot;, and Midnight Star &quot;Headlines&quot;.

The Junk Yard Band started out in 1980 as a group of kids (as young as nine) from the Barry Farm, Washington, D.C., projects. Unable to afford instruments for their band, they fashioned drums out of empty buckets and traffic cones, tin cans substituted for timbales, and, in place of a brass section, they used plastic toy horns. Adding real instruments to their gear a little at a time, by 1985 they had joined the ranks of D.C.&#x27;s finest; they were scooped up by Def Jam, who released a Rick Rubin-produced single &quot;The Word&quot; in 1986. Not much happened with that record—at first. However, within a year or two of its release, the flipside, &quot;Sardines&quot;, became (and remains to this day) the group&#x27;s signature song. It was even performed in the 1988 film &quot;Tougher Than Leather&quot;.

Rare Essence signed with Mercury/PolyGram Records but for one single for the label—&quot;Flipside,&quot; released in 1986—was unremarkable.

E.U. got its big break in 1986 when it was booked to play a party celebrating the release of Spike Lee&#x27;s debut film, &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot;. Lee liked what he heard, and tapped the band to perform a song in his next movie, &quot;School Daze&quot;. &quot;Da Butt&quot; (written for the film by Marcus Miller and E.U. keyboardist, Kent Wood) made it to number one on Billboard&#x27;s R&amp;B chart (No. 35 Pop) and scored the band a Grammy nomination (they lost to &quot;Love Overboard&quot; by Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips). Hoping to build on their success, in 1989 they released &quot;Livin&#x27; Large&quot; on Virgin Records. Two singles from the album (&quot;Buck Wild&quot; and &quot;Taste of Your Love&quot;) made respectable showings on Billboard&#x27;s R&amp;B/Hip-Hop singles chart but they failed to repeat the success of &quot;Da Butt.&quot; (The album peaked at No. 22 on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart and No. 158 on the Top 200.) A second Virgin release, &quot;Cold Kickin&#x27; It&quot;, came out the following year but failed to make much of an impression on the national charts. Experience Unlimited had a resurgence in the mid-1990s by partnering with the jazz and gospel singer Maiesha Rashad, performing under the name &quot;Maiesha and the Hip Huggers&quot;. Maiesha and the Hip Huggers have headlined events and concert venues such as B.B. King&#x27;s Blues Club and Grill, DAR Constitution Hall, &quot;Black Family Reunion&quot; and D.C.&#x27;s &quot;Stone Soul Picnic&quot; and &quot;Unifest&quot;. In 1988, R&amp;B singer Jesse James and Fay Marshall released soul singles(T.T.E.D. Records).

===1990s–2000s===
As time passed, more and more of a hip-hop influence crept into go-go. Early MCs like D.C. Scorpio gave way to DJ Kool, whose 1996 indie release &quot;Let Me Clear My Throat&quot;—based on a sample from DJ Mark the 45 King&#x27;s &quot;The 900 Number&quot;—was picked up by American Recordings and in 1997 became go-go&#x27;s last certifiable hit single (No. 4 on Billboard&#x27;s Rap singles chart, No. 21 on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop singles chart, and No. 30 on the Hot 100). As the hip-hop content in go-go increased, the complexity of the musical arrangements decreased. Where bands once featured horn sections and multiple guitarists in addition to a phalanx of percussionists, many current go-go bands have stripped down to just keyboards and percussion. Another trend is to have a dedicated percussionist with plastic &quot;wood blocks&quot; performing much of what used to be handled by the junior congas.

There was, however, a retro movement in the 2000s reverting to go-go&#x27;s original style of marathon sessions covering popular R&amp;B songs such as Northeast Groovers. Many of these bands used the term &quot;Grown &#x27;n Sexy&quot; to indicate a focus on appealing to audiences over 25. In 2006 and again in 2007, there was a Grown and Sexy Category at the WKYS 93.9 Go-Go Awards ceremony held at DAR Constitution Hall, which the Familiar Faces won in 2006, and L!ssen Da Grew^p won in 2007.

Some go-go artists have been able to transition into other areas of entertainment. Anwan &quot;Big G&quot; Glover—a founding member of the Backyard Band—became an actor, playing Slim Charles on HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Wire.&quot; D.C. band Mambo Sauce also had hits with &quot;Miracles&quot; and &quot;Welcome to D.C.&quot; which both cracked the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. &quot;Welcome to D.C.&quot; also became the official intro song for all of the Washington Wizards &amp; Mystics home games and the video for the song was in rotation on VH1 Soul and BETJ and received airplay on MTVJams, MTV2, MTVU and BET. Kevin Kato Hammond, former lead guitarist for Little Benny &amp; the Masters and former rapper for the band Proper Utensils, started the online magazine &quot;Take Me Out to the Go-Go&quot; in 1996. In addition to the magazine being a source of information on go-go shows, it serves as a community forum. During this time the emergence of Gogo combined with Pop was brewing. A producer by the name of Rich Harrison had began incorporating traditional gogo elements into his production and landed 3 huge major label placements with Jenifer Lopez - Get Right, Amerie - 1 Thing, and Beyonce - Crazy in Love. The latter 2 were huge for the sound but they weren’t associated with gogo as closely as the bands. The Rapper Wale also used gogo in his sound and was signed to Interscope with Mark Ronson and later MMG with Rick Ross. He used his platform to expand gogo to a mainstream audience with features (Pretty Girls ft Backyard Band, Bait ft TCB) and also live performances (UCB performing as his backing band at the MTV VMAs).

Additionally, musicians from other genres of music have incorporated elements of the go-go aesthetic into their compositions and stage acts. Jazz/rock musician Mike Dillon, leads a band called Go-Go Jungle, often playing long, non-stop sets that incorporate go-go beats and raps interspersed with other subgenres of funk, jazz, and rock. Another example is Bob Mintzer&#x27;s composition &quot;Go-Go&quot; from the Yellowjackets&#x27; 2003 release, &quot;Time Squared&quot;. Composer Liza Figueroa Kravinsky composed the &quot;Go-Go Symphony&quot;, an original full orchestra symphony that incorporates the go-go and bounce beats. She founded the identically named Go-Go Symphony ensemble, which performs the Go-Go Symphony and other mashups of go-go and classical, sometimes in partnership with other full symphony orchestras. The February 21, 2014, world premiere of the fully orchestrated Go-Go Symphony and similar pieces, performed with the Capital City Symphony, received standing ovations and rave reviews.

Gogo had also began evolving with the times. The creation of a new rhythmic pattern emerged from the Total Control Band aka TCB. Led by Polo, they coined this new style of gogo by calling it the Bounce Beat. The Bounce beat reigned supreme with the younger fans of gogo from 2003 to present day. 

Eventually the Bounce Beat started to slow down in tempo and some bands would create even slower vamps in songs called Slow Bounces. All of these new rhythmic ideas inspired dances to accompany them. The faster bounce beat was paired with a style called Beat Ya Feet while the slower would be paired with Chopping, and/or Clapping as a common practice by women. This era of gogo is infamous and very niche so the popular bands aren’t spoken about in traditional gogo conversations. A few names of these bands are TCB, CCB, UCB, TOB, Reaction, New Impressionz, ABM, XIB, AAO, Renegade, N2L, Gameova and UEB.

===2010s===
In the late 2000s and early 2010s, it became harder for go-go bands and local venues to hold concerts as law enforcement in both Washington, D.C., and neighboring Prince George&#x27;s County in Maryland viewed the concerts and bands as inciters of violence. New go-go music is still being produced, but remains local to the area, depending on live shows to share its full effects. However, most of the venues have closed, with some residents putting it down to gentrification which has forced many African-American residents out of previously low-income neighborhoods. One area, Shaw, which was 11 percent white in 1970, was 62 percent white by 2015. Some new residents, however, have embraced go-go and locals are optimistic that it will continue to thrive. After one new resident&#x27;s complaint about noise in the street, there were protests, which grew into a block party with go-go performances.

===2020s===
In February 2020, go-go was named the &quot;official music&quot; of Washington, D.C., in a unanimous vote by the D.C. Council following the #DontMuteDC movement. Go-go historians and local activists have advocated for city investment in go-go tourism as a result of financial challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;In Washington, D.C., the Black Lives Matter protests over the summer of 2020 often included go-go bands performing on truck beds as a highly visible and aural political symbol that could only happen in the capital of the United States.&quot; On August 22, 2021, it was announced that the DC Public Library&#x27;s Go-Go Archive had acquired the photography catalog of 1,956 photographic images shot by photographer Chip Py who spent ten years photographing the DC Go-Go scene and was one of Chuck Brown&#x27;s photographers for the archival and documented history of go-go. On February 14, 2022, the book &quot;DC Go-Go: Ten Years Backstage&quot; by photographer Chip Py was published by The History Press. The 208-page book features 251 of Py&#x27;s photographs of all the bands, legends and fans shot at the go-go as well as nine chapters about the origins, the culture, the legends, the bands, the culture, #dontmutedc and how Go-Go became the official music of Washington, D.C. In 2024 the Go-Go Museum and Cafe was opened, in Anacostia, Washington, D.C.

Gogo’s sound has also continued to advance with bands and artists fusing the sound into their own styles. Tone P, Drew Keys, Eddie Beat, Chop on da Beat, and Carter Beat are a few that have all made their own versions of an electronic style of gogo similar to what Wale used in his career. There has also been an emergence of rock fused gogo played by bands such as Black Alley, Tone P’s Band Tha Carry Out, Breezy Supreme, and HUE.

<text>HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; is a Town-class light cruiser that was built for the Royal Navy. She is now permanently moored as a museum ship on the River Thames in London and is operated by the Imperial War Museum.

Construction of &quot;Belfast&quot;, the first ship in the Royal Navy to be named after the capital city of Northern Ireland and one of ten Town-class cruisers, began in December 1936. She was launched on St Patrick&#x27;s Day 1938. Commissioned in early August 1939 shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, &quot;Belfast&quot; was initially part of the British naval blockade against Germany. In November 1939, &quot;Belfast&quot; triggered a German mine and, in spite of fears that she would be scrapped, spent more than two years undergoing extensive repairs. &quot;Belfast&quot; returned to action in November 1942 with improved firepower, radar equipment, and armour. &quot;Belfast&quot; saw action escorting Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union during 1943 and in December 1943 played an important role in the Battle of North Cape, assisting in the destruction of the German warship . In June 1944, &quot;Belfast&quot; took part in Operation Overlord supporting the Normandy landings. In June 1945, she was redeployed to the Far East to join the British Pacific Fleet, arriving shortly before the end of the Second World War. &quot;Belfast&quot; saw further combat action in during the Korean War and underwent an extensive modernisation between 1956 and 1959. A number of further overseas commissions followed before she entered reserve in 1963.

In 1967, efforts were initiated to avert &quot;Belfast&quot; expected scrapping and to preserve her as a museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum, and the Ministry of Defence was established and then reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971, however, the government decided against preservation, prompting the formation of the private HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; Trust to campaign for her preservation. The efforts of the Trust were successful, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the River Thames near Tower Bridge in the Pool of London. Opened to the public in October 1971, &quot;Belfast&quot; became a branch of the Imperial War Museum in 1978. Since 1973 she has been home to the City of London Sea Cadets who meet on board twice a week. A popular tourist attraction, &quot;Belfast&quot; received over 327,000 visitors in 2019. As a branch of a national museum and part of the National Historic Fleet, &quot;Belfast&quot; is supported by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, admissions income, and the museum&#x27;s commercial activities.

==Design==

&quot;Belfast&quot; is a cruiser of the third Town class. The Town class had originated in 1933 as the Admiralty&#x27;s response to the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s , an -ton cruiser mounting fifteen guns with a top speed exceeding . The Admiralty&#x27;s requirement called for a 9,000-ton cruiser, sufficiently armoured to withstand a direct hit from an shell, capable of and mounting twelve 6-inch guns. Seaplanes carried aboard would enable shipping lanes to be patrolled over a wide area, and the class was also to be capable of its own anti-aircraft defence. Under the Director of Naval Construction the new design evolved during 1933. The lead ship of the new class, the 9,100-ton , and her sister , were ordered under the 1933 estimates. Three more cruisers were built to this design, with a further three ships built to a slightly larger 9,400-ton design in 1935–36. By 1935, however, the Admiralty was keen to improve the firepower of these cruisers to match the firepower of the Japanese &quot;Mogami&quot; and American s; both were armed with fifteen 6-inch guns. The Admiralty rejected a design featuring five triple turrets as impractical, while an alternative design fitting four quadruple turrets was rejected as an effective quadruple turret could not be developed. In May 1936 the Admiralty decided to fit triple turrets, whose improved design would permit an increase in deck armour. This modified design became the 10,000-ton &quot;Edinburgh&quot; subclass, named after &quot;Belfast&quot;″s sister ship . &quot;Belfast&quot; was ordered from Harland and Wolff on 21 September 1936, and her keel laid on 10 December 1936. Her expected cost was £2,141,514; of which the guns cost £75,000 and the aircraft (two Supermarine Walruses) £66,500. She was launched on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, 17 March 1938, by Anne Chamberlain, the wife of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. The launch was filmed by Pathé News. From March to August 1939, &quot;Belfast&quot; was fitted out and underwent sea trials.

When completed, &quot;Belfast&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Her standard displacement during her sea trials was . She was propelled by four three-drum oil-fired Admiralty water-tube boilers, turning Parsons geared steam turbines, driving four propeller shafts. She was capable of and carried of fuel oil. This gave her a maximum range of at .

&quot;Belfast&quot;″s main armament comprised twelve Mk XXIII 6-inch guns in four triple turrets directed by an Admiralty Fire Control Table. With a rate of fire of up to eight rounds per gun per minute, her main battery was capable of a total maximum rate of fire of 96 rounds per minute. Her secondary armament comprised twelve 4-inch guns in six twin mounts. Her initial close-range anti-aircraft armament was sixteen 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; guns in two eight-barrel mountings, and two quadruple Vickers .50 machine guns. She also mounted six Mk IV 21-inch torpedo tubes in two triple mounts, and fifteen Mk VII depth charges.

&quot;Belfast&quot; was protected by a main armour belt, with deck armour of over her magazines, and over her machinery spaces. Her six-inch turrets were protected by up to of armour.

&quot;Belfast&quot;″s aviation capability was provided by two catapult-launched Supermarine Walrus amphibious biplanes. These could be launched from a D1H catapult mounted aft of the forward superstructure, and recovered from the water by two cranes mounted on either side of the forward funnel. The aircraft, operated by the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; Flight of 700 Naval Air Squadron, were stowed in two hangars in the forward superstructure.

==Second World War==

===1939–1942: Commissioning, prize capture, mining, and repairs===
&quot;Belfast&quot; departed for Portsmouth on 3 August 1939, and was commissioned on 5 August 1939, less than a month before the outbreak of the Second World War. Her first captain was Captain G A Scott with a crew of 761, and her first assignment was to the Home Fleet&#x27;s 2nd Cruiser Squadron. On 14 August, &quot;Belfast&quot; took part in her first exercise, Operation &quot;Hipper&quot;, in which she played the role of a German commerce raider attempting to escape into the Atlantic. By navigating the hazardous Pentland Firth, &quot;Belfast&quot; successfully evaded the Home Fleet.

On 31 August 1939 &quot;Belfast&quot; was transferred to the 18th Cruiser Squadron. Based at Scapa Flow in the Orkney islands, 18th Cruiser Squadron was part of the British effort to impose a naval blockade on Germany. Germany invaded Poland the following day, and Britain and France declared war on 3 September. At 11:40 that morning, &quot;Belfast&quot; received the message ‘Commence hostilities at once against Germany’. On 8 September &quot;Belfast&quot; put to sea from Scapa Flow with the battlecruisers , , her sister ship &quot;Edinburgh&quot; and four destroyers, on a patrol intended to intercept German ships returning from Norway. In particular, they were to search for the Norddeutscher Lloyd liner . No enemy vessels were found. On 25 September, &quot;Belfast&quot; took part in a fleet operation to recover the submarine , during which the ship was attacked by German aircraft, but suffered no damage. On 1 October 1939 &quot;Belfast&quot; left Scapa Flow for a patrol in the North Sea. On 5 October &quot;Belfast&quot; intercepted and boarded a neutral Norwegian factory ship that was sailing in company with six whaling ships. On 8 October the ship sighted the Swedish merchant ship &quot;C. P. Lilljevach&quot; but, in poor weather, did not intercept or board her. The following day she boarded &quot;Tai Yin&quot;, a Norwegian ship. &quot;Tai Yin&quot; had been listed by the Admiralty as suspicious, so a prize crew from &quot;Belfast&quot; sailed her to Kirkwall for investigation. On 9 October &quot;Belfast&quot; intercepted a German liner, the 13,615-ton &quot;Cap Norte&quot;, north-west of the Faroe Islands. Disguised as a neutral Swedish vessel, SS &quot;Ancona&quot;, &quot;Cap Norte&quot; was attempting to return to Germany from Brazil; her passengers included German reservists. Under the Admiralty&#x27;s prize rules, &quot;Belfast&quot;″s crew later received prize money. On 12 October &quot;Belfast&quot; boarded the Swedish ship &quot;Uddeholm&quot;, which was also sailed to Kirkwall by a prize crew. Returning to harbour, on the night of 13–14 October, &quot;Belfast&quot; was among the few ships anchored in Scapa Flow, following intelligence reports of an expected air raid. That night, the battleship was torpedoed by German submarine , which had infiltrated the anchorage. On the morning following the sinking, &quot;Belfast&quot; left for Loch Ewe.

On 10 November &quot;Belfast&quot; was taken off the northern patrol and reassigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron. This squadron was to form an independent striking force based at Rosyth. On 21 November, &quot;Belfast&quot; was to take part in the force&#x27;s first sortie, a gunnery exercise. At 10:58 am she detonated a magnetic mine while leaving the Firth of Forth. The mine broke &quot;Belfast&quot;″s keel, and wrecked one of her engine and boiler rooms. Twenty officers and men required hospital treatment for injuries caused by the explosion, and a further 26 suffered minor injuries. One man, Painter 2nd Class Henry Stanton, was hospitalised but later died of a head injury, having been thrown against the deckhead by the blast. The tugboat &quot;Krooman&quot;, towing gunnery targets for the exercise, released her targets and instead towed &quot;Belfast&quot; to Rosyth for initial repairs.

Initial assessments of &quot;Belfast&quot;″s damage showed that, while the mine had done little direct damage to the outer hull, causing only a small hole directly below one of the boiler rooms, the shock of the explosion had caused severe warping, breaking machinery, deforming the decks and causing the keel to hog (bend upwards) by three inches. On 4 January 1940 &quot;Belfast&quot; was decommissioned to Care and Maintenance status, becoming the responsibility of Rosyth Dockyard, and her crew dispersed to other vessels. By 28 June she had been repaired sufficiently to sail to Devonport, arriving on 30 June under the command of Lt Cdr H W Parkinson.

During her repairs, work was carried out to straighten, reconstruct and strengthen her hull. Her armour belt was also extended and thickened. Her armament was updated with newer 2-pounder pom-pom mountings, and her anti-aircraft armament improved with eighteen 20 mm Oerlikon guns in five twin and eight single mountings, replacing two quadruple 0.5-inch Vickers guns. &quot;Belfast&quot; also received new fire control radars for her main, secondary and anti-aircraft guns. Her November 1942 radar fit included one Type 284 set and four Type 283 sets to direct the main armament, three Type 285 sets for the secondary guns, and two Type 282 sets for the 2-pounder anti-aircraft guns. She also received a Type 273 general surface warning radar, Type 251 and 252 sets for identification friend or foe (IFF) purposes, and a Type 281 and Type 242 for air warning. Her 1942 electronics suite also included a Type 270 echosounder. Due to her increased topweight, a bulge was introduced into her hull amidships to improve stability and provide extra longitudinal strength. Her beam had increased to and her draught to forward and aft. Her displacement had risen to  tons.

===1942–1943: Recommissioning, Arctic convoys and Battle of North Cape===

&quot;Belfast&quot; was recommissioned at Devonport on 3 November 1942, under the command of Captain Frederick Parham. On her return to the Home Fleet &quot;Belfast&quot; was made flagship of the 10th Cruiser Squadron, flying the flag of Rear-Admiral Robert Burnett, who had previously commanded the Home Fleet&#x27;s destroyer flotillas. The squadron was responsible for the hazardous task of escorting Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union, operating from Scapa Flow and bases in Iceland. Her radar suite reduced &quot;Belfast&quot; need for aerial surveillance, and her aircraft were disembarked in June 1943. &quot;Belfast&quot; spent 1943 engaged on convoy escort and blockade patrol duties, and on 5–6 October of the same year, formed part of the covering force during Operation Leader, an airstrike against German shipping in the waters of northern Norway near Bodø by the aircraft carrier .

On 26 December 1943, &quot;Belfast&quot; participated in the Battle of North Cape. This battle, which occurred during the Arctic night, involved two strong Royal Navy formations; the first, Force One, comprised the cruisers (with 8-inch guns), and &quot;Belfast&quot; (the 10th Cruiser Squadron) with three destroyers, and the second, Force Two, comprised the battleship and the cruiser with four destroyers. Bruce Fraser, C-in-C Home Fleet, expected and hoped that the German battleship would sortie from its Norwegian base and attempt to attack Convoy JW 55B sailing from Scotland to Murmansk in the USSR. And indeed, on 25 December 1943, Christmas Day, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; left port in northern Norway to attack Convoy JW 55B. The next day Force One, which had left Murmansk on the 23rd, encountered &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, prevented her from attacking the convoy, and forced her to retreat after being damaged by the British cruisers. As &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; attacked again at noon she was intercepted by Force Two and sunk by the combined formations. &quot;Belfast&quot; played an important role in the battle; as flagship of the 10th Cruiser Squadron, she was among the first to encounter &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, and coordinated the squadron&#x27;s defence of the convoy. After &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; turned away from the convoy, Admiral Burnett in &quot;Belfast&quot; shadowed her by radar from outside visual range, enabling her interception by &quot;Duke of York&quot;.

===1944: &quot;Tirpitz&quot; and D-Day===
After North Cape, &quot;Belfast&quot; refuelled at Kola Inlet before sailing for the United Kingdom, arriving at Scapa to replenish her fuel, ammunition and stores on New Year&#x27;s Day 1944. &quot;Belfast&quot; sailed to Rosyth on 10 January, where her crew received a period of leave. February 1944 saw &quot;Belfast&quot; resume her Arctic convoy duties, and on 30 March 1944 &quot;Belfast&quot; sailed with the covering force of Operation Tungsten, a large carrier-launched Fleet Air Arm airstrike against the German battleship . Moored in Altafjord in northern Norway, &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was the German navy&#x27;s last surviving capital ship. Forty-two Fairey Barracuda dive-bombers from and made up the strike force; escorted by eighty fighters. Launched on 3 April, the bombers scored fourteen hits, immobilising &quot;Tirpitz&quot; for two months, with one Barracuda shot down. &quot;Belfast&quot; underwent minor repairs at Rosyth from 23 April to 8 May, while her crew received a period of leave. On 8 May &quot;Belfast&quot; returned to Scapa Flow and carried the King during his pre-invasion visit to the Home Fleet.
For the invasion of Normandy &quot;Belfast&quot; was made headquarters ship of Bombardment Force E flying the flag of Rear-Admiral Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton, and was to support landings by British and Canadian forces in the Gold and Juno Beach sectors. On 2 June &quot;Belfast&quot; left the River Clyde for her bombardment areas. That morning Prime Minister Winston Churchill had announced his intention to go to sea with the fleet and witness the invasion from HMS &quot;Belfast&quot;. This was opposed by the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the First Sea Lord, Sir Andrew Cunningham. An intervention by the King eventually prevented Churchill from going.

The invasion was to begin on 5 June but bad weather forced a 24-hour delay. At 5:30 am on 6 June, &quot;Belfast&quot; opened fire on a German artillery battery at Ver-sur-Mer, suppressing the guns until the site was overrun by British infantry of 7th Battalion, Green Howards. On 12 June &quot;Belfast&quot; supported Canadian troops moving inland from Juno Beach and returned to Portsmouth on 16 June to replenish her ammunition. She returned two days later for further bombardments. On the night of 6 July &quot;Belfast&quot; was threatened at anchor by German motor torpedo boats (&quot;E-boats&quot;). She evaded them by weighing anchor and moving to the concealment of a smoke screen. &quot;Belfast&quot; fired her last round in European waters on 8 July, in company with the monitor and the battleship , as part of Operation Charnwood. On 10 July she sailed for Scapa, the fighting in France having moved inland beyond the range of her guns. During her five weeks off Normandy, &quot;Belfast&quot; had fired 1,996 rounds from her six-inch guns.

===1945: Service in the Far East===
On 29 July 1944, Captain Parham handed over command of HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; to Captain R M Dick, and until April 1945 &quot;Belfast&quot; underwent a refit to prepare for service against Japan in the Far East which improved her accommodation for tropical conditions, and updated her anti-aircraft armament and fire control in order to counter expected kamikaze attacks by Japanese aircraft. By May 1945, &quot;Belfast&quot; mounted thirty-six 2-pounder guns in two eight-gun mounts, four quadruple mounts, and four single mounts. She also mounted fourteen 20 mm Oerlikons. Her two aftmost 4-inch mountings were removed, and the remainder fitted with Remote Power Control. Her empty hangars were converted to crew accommodation, and her aircraft catapult was removed.

Her radar fit now included a Type 277 radar set to replace her Type 273 for surface warning. Her Type 281 air warning set was replaced by a single-antenna Type 281B set, while a Type 293Q was fitted for close-range height-finding and surface warning. A Type 274 set was fitted for main armament fire direction. On 17 June 1945, with the war in Europe at an end, &quot;Belfast&quot; sailed for the Far East via Gibraltar, Malta, Alexandria, Port Said, Aden, Colombo and Sydney. By the time she arrived in Sydney on 7 August &quot;Belfast&quot; had been made flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the British Pacific Fleet. While in Sydney &quot;Belfast&quot; underwent another short refit, supplementing her close-range armament with five 40 mm Bofors guns. &quot;Belfast&quot; had been expected to join in Operation Downfall, but this was forestalled by the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945.

==Post-war service 19451950==

With the end of the war, &quot;Belfast&quot; remained in the Far East, conducting a number of cruises to ports in Japan, China and Malaya and sailing for Portsmouth on 20 August 1947. There she paid off into reserve, and underwent a refit during which her turbines were opened for maintenance. She also received two more single Bofors guns, in place of two of her single 2-pounder mountings. She was recommissioned on 22 September 1948 and, before returning to the Far East, visited her home city of Belfast, arriving on 20 October. The following day, 21 October 1948, the ship&#x27;s company marked Trafalgar Day with a march through the city. The next day &quot;Belfast&quot; took charge of a silver ship&#x27;s bell, a gift of the people of Belfast. She sailed for Hong Kong on 23 October to join the Royal Navy&#x27;s Far East Fleet, arriving in late December. By 1949, the political situation in China was precarious, with the Chinese Civil War moving towards its conclusion. As flagship of the 5th Cruiser Squadron, &quot;Belfast&quot; was the Far Eastern Station&#x27;s headquarters ship during the April 1949 &quot;Amethyst&quot; Incident, in which a British sloop, , was trapped in the Yangtze River by the communist People&#x27;s Liberation Army. &quot;Belfast&quot; remained in Hong Kong during 1949, sailing for Singapore on 18 January 1950. There she underwent a minor refit between January and March 1950, and in June she joined the Far East Fleet&#x27;s summer cruise. On 25 June 1950, while &quot;Belfast&quot; was visiting Hakodate in Japan, North Korean forces crossed the 38th Parallel, starting the Korean War.

==Korean War 19501952==
With the outbreak of the Korean War, &quot;Belfast&quot; became part of the United Nations naval forces. Originally part of the US Navy&#x27;s Task Force 77, &quot;Belfast&quot; was detached in order to operate independently on 5 July 1950. During July and early August 1950, &quot;Belfast&quot; undertook coastal patrols and was based at Sasebo in Japan&#x27;s Nagasaki Prefecture. From 19 July &quot;Belfast&quot; supported troops fighting around Yongdok, accompanied by . That day &quot;Belfast&quot; fired an accurate 350-round bombardment from her 6-inch guns, and was praised by an American admiral as a &quot;straight-shooting ship&quot;. On 6 August she sailed for the UK for a short (but needed) refit, after which she again set sail for the far east and arrived back at Sasebo on 31 January 1951.

During 1951 &quot;Belfast&quot; mounted a number of coastal patrols and bombarded a variety of targets. On 1 June she arrived at Singapore for refitting, arriving back on patrol on 31 August. In September 1951 &quot;Belfast&quot; provided anti-aircraft cover for a salvage operation to recover a crashed enemy MiG-15 jet fighter. She conducted further bombardments and patrols before receiving a month&#x27;s leave from operations, returning to action on 23 December.

In 1952 &quot;Belfast&quot; continued her coastal patrol duties. On 29 July 1952 &quot;Belfast&quot; was hit by enemy fire while engaging an artillery battery on Wolsa-ri island. A 75 mm shell struck a forward compartment, killing a British sailor of Chinese origin in his hammock and wounding four other Chinese ratings. This was the only time &quot;Belfast&quot; was hit by enemy fire during her Korean service. On 27 September 1952 &quot;Belfast&quot; was relieved by two other Town-class cruisers, and HMS &quot;Newcastle&quot;, and sailed back to the UK. She had steamed over in the combat zone and fired more than 8,000 rounds from her 6-inch guns during the Korean War. She paid off in Chatham on 4 November 1952 and entered reserve at Devonport on 1 December.

==Modernisation and final commissions 1955–1963==

In reserve, &quot;Belfast&quot;″s future was uncertain: post-war defence cuts made manpower-intensive cruisers excessively costly to operate and it was not until March 1955 that the decision was taken to modernise &quot;Belfast&quot;. Work began on 6 January 1956. Although described as only an extended refit, the cost of £5.5 million was substantial for this large middle-aged cruiser. Changes included: individual MRS8 directors for the new twin Mk 5 40 mm and the twin 4-inch mount; the 4-inch guns training and elevation speed was increased to 20 degrees per second; and protecting key parts of the ship against nuclear, biological or chemical attack. This last consideration meant significantly enlarging and enclosing her bridge, creating a two-tiered, five-sided superstructure which radically altered her appearance. Her boiler rooms were also given remote control so they could still be run in the event of a nuclear, biological or chemical attack as the boiler rooms themselves were not protected. The most significant change was better accommodations for a smaller crew more fitting of post-war needs. Her tripod masts were replaced with lattice masts and timber decking replaced with steel everywhere except the quarterdeck. The overall effect was to create a cruiser significantly more habitable but different internally and to a degree in external appearance from wartime cruisers but still essentially a surface warfare, &#x27;anti Sverdlov&#x27; cruiser, with anti-aircraft defence updated for point defence only out to . 

&quot;Belfast&quot; recommissioned at Devonport on 12 May 1959. Her close-range armament was standardised to six twin 40 mm Bofors guns, and her close-range fire direction similarly standardised to eight close-range blindfire directors fitted with Type 262 radar. Her 1959 radar fit included two Type 274 lock and follow radar directors for main armament direction against sea and land targets, Type 277Q and 293Q for height-finding and surface warning, Type 960M for air warning, and 974 for surface warning. In order to save weight, her torpedo armament was removed. Modern passive sonar Type 174 and 176 was installed and noise-reducing rubber insulation fitted to the propeller shaft.

&quot;Belfast&quot; arrived in Singapore on 16 December 1959 and spent most of 1960 at sea on exercise, calling at ports in Hong Kong, Borneo, India, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Australia, the Philippines and Japan. On 31 January 1961, &quot;Belfast&quot; recommissioned under the command of Captain Morgan Morgan-Giles. On her final foreign commission &quot;Belfast&quot; joined a number of exercises in the Far East and in December 1961 she provided the British guard of honour at Tanganyika&#x27;s independence ceremony in Dar-es-Salaam.

In 1961 plans were drawn up for the conversion of &quot;Belfast&quot; to a hybrid helicopter cruiser for amphibious operations. The two aft 6-inch turrets would be removed to accommodate a helicopter deck and two hangars capable of housing four Westland Wessex helicopters, while the 4-inch guns would be replaced by davits for four LCA landing craft. Only one of the ship&#x27;s two boiler rooms would be used, which together with the reductions in armament would allow the ship&#x27;s crew to be reduced so freeing up space to carry troops. Two infantry companies, 30 officers and 230 other ranks, would be carried. The plan was rejected in December 1961 as the time required to carry out the conversions was too great.
The ship left Singapore on 26 March 1962 for the UK, sailing east via Hong Kong, Guam and Pearl Harbor, San Francisco, Seattle, British Columbia, Panama and Trinidad. She arrived at Portsmouth on 19 June 1962.

Recommissioned in July, she made a final visit to Belfast from 23 to 29 November before paying off into reserve on 25 February 1963. In July 1963 &quot;Belfast&quot; was recommissioned for the last time, with a crew of the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) and a number of Sea Cadets flying the flag of the Admiral Commanding Reserves, Rear Admiral Hugh Martell. &quot;Belfast&quot; sailed for Gibraltar in company with sixteen RNR minesweepers for a two-week exercise in the Mediterranean on 10 August. Martell&#x27;s obituarist considered this commission a well-judged contrivance which &quot;did much to restore the confidence and image of the new RNR&quot; which had undergone an acrimonious amalgamation with the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in 1958.

==Reserve, decommissioning, and preservation efforts 1963–1971==
&quot;Belfast&quot; returned to Devonport on 24 August 1963 and underwent a short refit to prepare her for paying off into reserve, which occurred in December 1963. In January 1966 parts of the ship and power systems were reactivated and from May 1966 to 1970 she served as an accommodation ship (taking over those duties from &quot;Sheffield&quot;), moored in Fareham Creek, for the Reserve Division at Portsmouth. While &quot;Belfast&quot; lay at Fareham Creek the Imperial War Museum, Britain&#x27;s national museum of twentieth-century conflict, became interested in preserving a 6-inch turret. The turret would represent a number of classes of cruiser (then disappearing from service) and would complement the museum&#x27;s pair of British 15-inch naval guns. 

On 14 April 1967 museum staff visited , a also moored in Fareham Creek at the time. Following the visit the possibility was raised of preserving an entire ship. &quot;Gambia&quot; had already severely deteriorated, so attention turned to the possibility of saving &quot;Belfast&quot;. The Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum and the Ministry of Defence established a joint committee, which reported in June 1968 that the scheme was practical and economic. However, in early 1971, David Eccles the Paymaster General decided against preservation. On 4 May 1971 &quot;Belfast&quot; was &quot;reduced to disposal&quot; to await scrapping.

==HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; Trust 1971–1977==

Following the government&#x27;s refusal, a private trust was formed to campaign for the ship&#x27;s preservation. The &quot;Belfast&quot; Trust was established; its chairman was Rear-Admiral Sir Morgan Morgan-Giles, captain of &quot;Belfast&quot; from January 1961 to July 1962. As Member of Parliament (MP) for Winchester, Morgan-Giles addressed the House of Commons on 8 March 1971. He described &quot;Belfast&quot; as being in &quot;a really wonderful state of preservation&quot; and that saving her for the nation represented a &quot;case of grasping the last opportunity&quot;. Among the MPs who spoke in support of Morgan-Giles was Gordon Bagier, MP for Sunderland South, who served as a Royal Marine gunner aboard &quot;Belfast&quot; and was present at both the sinking of &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and the Normandy landings. Speaking for the government, the Under-secretary for the Navy, Peter Kirk, said that &quot;Belfast&quot; was &quot;one of the most historic ships which the Navy has had in the last 20 years&quot;, but that he could not prevent the stripping of the ship&#x27;s removable equipment, as this was already too far advanced to be halted. He did, however, agree to postpone any decision on the scrapping of &quot;Belfast&quot; to allow the Trust to put together a formal proposal.

Following the Trust&#x27;s efforts, the government agreed to hand over &quot;Belfast&quot; to the Trustees in July 1971, with Vice Admiral Sir Donald Gibson as her first director. At a press conference in August the Trust announced &quot;Operation Seahorse&quot;, the plan to bring &quot;Belfast&quot; to London. She was towed from Portsmouth to London via Tilbury, where she was fitted out as a museum. She was towed to her berth above Tower Bridge on 15 October 1971 and settled in a huge hole that had been dredged in the river bed; then she was attached to two dolphins which guide her during the rise and fall of the tide.

She was opened to the public on Trafalgar Day, 21 October 1971. The date was significant, as &quot;Belfast&quot; was the first naval vessel to be saved for the nation since , Lord Nelson&#x27;s flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar. Though no longer part of the Royal Navy, HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; was granted a special dispensation to allow her to continue to fly the White Ensign.

Now a museum, the ship&#x27;s opening was well received: in 1972 the HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; Trust won the British Tourist Authority&#x27;s &quot;Come to Britain&quot; trophy. Support for the ship&#x27;s restoration was received from individuals, from the Royal Navy, and from commercial businesses; in 1973, for example, the Worshipful Company of Bakers provided dummy bread for display in the ship&#x27;s NAAFI and bakery. By 1974, areas including the Admiral&#x27;s bridge and forward boiler and engine rooms had been restored and fitted out. That year also saw the refurbishment of the ship&#x27;s Operations Room by a team from , and the return of &quot;Belfast&quot;″s six twin Bofors mounts, along with their fire directors. By December 1975 &quot;Belfast&quot; had received 1,500,000 visitors. In 1976 &quot;Belfast&quot; was reaffiliated with the successors to the British Army&#x27;s Royal Ulster Rifles, the Royal Irish Rangers, and in the same year the Royal Naval Amateur Radio Society restored the ship&#x27;s Bridge Wireless Office to working order.

==Imperial War Museum 1978–present==
By 1977, the financial position of the HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; Trust had become marginal, and the Imperial War Museum sought permission to merge the Trust into the museum. On 19 January 1978 the Secretary of State for Education and Science, Shirley Williams, accepted the proposal stating that HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; &quot;is a unique demonstration of an important phase of our history and technology&quot;. The ship was transferred to the museum on 1 March 1978, and became the Imperial War Museum&#x27;s third branch, Duxford aerodrome having been acquired in 1976. In October 1998, the HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; Association was formed to reunite former members of the ship&#x27;s company. The Imperial War Museum&#x27;s Sound Archive also seeks to record oral history interviews with former crewmen.

===Preservation===

Since being brought to London &quot;Belfast&quot; has twice been drydocked as part of the ship&#x27;s long-term preservation. In 1982 she was docked at Tilbury, and in June 1999 &quot;Belfast&quot; was towed to Portsmouth. This was the first time she had been to sea in 28 years and thus required a Certificate of Seaworthiness from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. While in dock, her entire hull was cleaned, blasted, and repainted, her hull blanking plates inspected and an ultrasonic survey carried out. She was not expected to require further drydocking until 2020. While under tow to Portsmouth she was delayed by bad weather and arrived a day late: it had been intended that she would arrive on 6 June 1999, the fifty-fifth anniversary of the Normandy landings. 

During the maintenance work, &quot;Belfast&quot; hull and topsides were repainted in her specific camouflage scheme officially known as &quot;Admiralty Disruptive Camouflage Type 25&quot;, which she had worn from November 1942 to July 1944. This was objected to by some, due to the anachronistic conflict between her camouflage, which reflects the majority of her active Second World War service, and her present configuration, which was the result of the ship&#x27;s extended refit from January 1956 to May 1959. With the establishment of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport&#x27;s (DCMS) Advisory Committee on National Historic Ships in 2006, &quot;Belfast&quot; was listed as part of the National Historic Fleet.

On 9 May 2010, a ceremony was held aboard &quot;Belfast&quot; to mark the 65th anniversary of end of the Second World War in Europe. Veterans of the Arctic convoys were in attendance to receive medals from the Russian Ambassador Yuri Fedotov. During the ceremony it was announced that, as part of the restoration of the ship, two new masts had been manufactured at the Severnaya Verf shipyard near Saint Petersburg. The production of the masts, to replace corroded originals, had been supported by a number of Russian businesses at a reported cost of £500,000. The restoration of the masts involved removing the fittings from both masts, allowing them to be individually restored. The old masts were then cut down in sections, the new masts erected, and the original fittings replaced. On 19 October 2010, the new masts were dedicated at a ceremony attended by HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; veterans, by Prince Philip and officials from the Russian embassy and government.

In 2017, it was announced that the third of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 26 frigates would be named &quot;Belfast&quot;. At the same time, the IWM stated that the museum would be renamed as &quot;HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; (1938)&quot; as a means of avoiding confusion.

===Interpretation===

When &quot;Belfast&quot; was first opened to the public, visitors were limited to the upper decks and forward superstructure. As of 2011, nine decks are open to the public. Access to the ship is via a walkway which connects the quarterdeck with the pedestrianised footpath on the south bank of the River Thames. The Imperial War Museum&#x27;s guidebook to HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; divides the ship into three broad sections. The first of these, &quot;Life on board the ship&quot;, focuses on the experience of serving at sea. Restored compartments, some populated with dressed figures, illustrate the crew&#x27;s living conditions and the ship&#x27;s various facilities such as the sick bay, galley, laundry, chapel, mess decks and NAAFI. Since 2002, school and youth groups have been able to stay onboard &quot;Belfast&quot; overnight, sleeping in bunks on a restored 1950s mess deck.

The second section, &quot;The inner workings&quot;, below the waterline and protected by the ship&#x27;s armoured belt, contains core mechanical, electrical and communication systems. As well as the engine and boiler rooms, other compartments include the transmitting station (housing the ship&#x27;s Admiralty Fire Control Table, a mechanical computer), the forward steering position and one of &quot;Belfast&quot;″s six-inch shell rooms and magazines. The third section, &quot;Action stations&quot;, includes the upper deck and forward superstructure with the ship&#x27;s armament, fire control, and command facilities. Areas open to the public include the operations room, Admiral&#x27;s bridge and gun direction platform. During 2011, two of these areas were reinterpreted. The operations room was restored to its appearance during Exercise Pony Express, a large British-Australian-American joint exercise held off North Borneo in 1961. The reinterpretation included an interactive audio-visual plotting table. 
In July 2011, the interior of Y Turret, the aftmost 6-inch turret, was redisplayed using audio-visual and atmospheric effects, seeking to evoke the experience of a gunner at the Battle of North Cape. To emphasise the range of the ship&#x27;s armament, the forward six-inch guns of A and B Turrets are trained on the London Gateway service area on the M1 motorway, approximately away on the outskirts of London. A 4-inch gun mount and a shell hoist are kept in working order and used during blank-firing demonstrations by the Wavy Navy re-enactment group. In addition to the various areas of the ship open to visitors, some compartments have been fitted out as dedicated exhibition space. Permanent exhibitions include &quot;HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; in War and Peace&quot; and &quot;Life at Sea&quot;. The cost of admission to HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; includes a multilingual audio guide.

HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; also serves as the headquarters of the City of London Sea Cadet Corps, and her prestigious location in central London as a result means she frequently has other vessels berthed alongside. In October 2007, &quot;Belfast&quot; hosted the naming ceremony of the lighthouse tender with the Queen and Prince Philip in attendance.

===2011 accident===
On 29 November 2011, two workmen suffered minor injuries after a section of gangway, connected to the ship, collapsed during renovation works. The ship was closed to visitors following the accident. An investigation later established that the collapse of the gangway had been caused by a subcontractor cutting through the gangway&#x27;s structure during refurbishment work. &quot;Belfast&quot; re-opened on 18 May 2012.

The closure delayed the construction of a new two-storey bank-side pavilion to replace &quot;Belfast&quot;″s existing retail and admissions building. The structure, for which planning permission was received in October 2011, provides a ground floor café, shop and admissions area, and a rooftop bar. Initially expected to be complete by summer 2012, the pavilion opened in April 2013.

<doc id="209821" wikidata="Q1093950" url="?curid=209821" title="City Hall, London (Southwark)">
<text>Old City Hall is a building in Bermondsey, London, which previously served as the headquarters of the Greater London Authority (GLA) between July 2002 and December 2021. It is located in the London Borough of Southwark, on the south bank of the River Thames near Tower Bridge. In June 2020, the GLA started a consultation on proposals to vacate then City Hall and move to The Crystal, a GLA-owned property in Newham, at the end of 2021. The decision was confirmed on 3 November 2020 and the GLA vacated City Hall on 2 December 2021. The Southwark location is ultimately owned by the government of Kuwait.

==History==
The City Hall building was designed by Norman Foster and was constructed at a cost of £43 million on a site formerly occupied by wharves serving the Pool of London. It opened in July 2002, two years after the GLA was created, and was leased rather than owned by the GLA. Despite its name, City Hall did not serve a city (according to UK law). It had responsibilities over Greater London, which should not be confused with the City of London, which has its headquarters at the Guildhall. 

In June 2011, Mayor Boris Johnson announced that for the duration of the London 2012 Olympic Games, the building would be called &quot;London House&quot;.

In November 2020, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan announced plans to vacate City Hall at the end of 2021 and relocate to The Crystal in the Royal Victoria Docks area of East London. Khan cited the high cost of rent as the reason for relocating the GLA headquarters, stating that vacating City Hall in favour of a property owned by the authority would save it £55 million over the course of five years.

In 2023, St Martins Property announced that the architectural firms of Gensler and LDA Design had completed a plan to redesign the unused structure as a mixed-use office and retail building. It was intended to replace the iconic spiral with leafy terraces and replace the glazing with different materials. The proposals were approved by Southwark Council in December 2024. Around of floor space - of office space and of retail space - would be added to the building, following straightening of the slant on its southern side, extending the footprint of the building by 14.2m.

==Design==

The building has an unusual, bulbous shape, purportedly intended to reduce its surface area and thus improve energy efficiency, although the excess energy consumption caused by the exclusive use of glass (in a double façade) overwhelms the benefit of shape. Despite claiming the building &quot;demonstrates the potential for a sustainable, virtually non-polluting public building&quot;, energy use measurements have shown this building to be fairly inefficient in terms of energy use (375 kWh/m2/yr), with a 2012 Display Energy Performance Certificate rating of &quot;E&quot;. It has been compared variously to a helmet (either Darth Vader&#x27;s or simply a motorcyclist&#x27;s), a misshapen egg, and a woodlouse. Former mayor Ken Livingstone referred to it as a &quot;glass testicle&quot;, while his successor, Boris Johnson, made the same comparison using a different word, &quot;The Glass Gonad&quot; and more politely as &quot;The Onion&quot;.

A helical walkway ascends the full ten storeys. At the top is an exhibition and meeting space with an open viewing deck that was occasionally open to the public. The ramp could not be used as intended for security reasons. The walkway provides views of the interior of the building, and is intended to symbolise transparency; a similar device was used by Foster in his design for the rebuilt Reichstag (parliament), when Germany&#x27;s capital was moved back to Berlin. In 2006 it was announced that photovoltaic cells would be fitted to the building by the London Climate Change Agency.

The debating chamber was located at the bottom of the helical stairway. The seats and desks for assembly members were arranged in a circular form.

==Location==
The building is located on The Queen&#x27;s Walk, a part of the extended pedestrianised south-side embankment of the River Thames in the London Borough of Southwark. It forms part of a larger development called More London, including offices and shops. The nearest London Underground and National Rail station is London Bridge.

==In popular culture==
In 2015, City Hall acted as location for the fictional HQ of the Joint Intelligence Service in the James Bond film &quot;Spectre&quot;. The building appeared taller, and in a different Thames-side location in the movie through the use of computer-generated imagery. In 2016 the walkways were filled with musicians during Open House London in a site-specific work by British composer Samuel Bordoli, which explored the unique acoustic of the structure. In 2018, the final selection for the television show &quot;The Apprentice&quot; was filmed in City Hall.
It is featured in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; games &quot;Mario Kart Tour&quot; and &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot; as part of the London Loop racecourse.

<doc id="209822" wikidata="Q379702" url="?curid=209822" title="Louis-Eugène Cavaignac">
<text>Louis-Eugène Cavaignac (; 15 October 1802 – 28 October 1857) was a French general and politician who served as head of the executive power of France between June and December 1848, during the French Second Republic.

Born in Paris to a prominent family, Cavaignac was educated for a military career. Shortly after returning from service in the Morea expedition he took part in the July Revolution, and in 1832 was sent to Algeria, at the start of the French invasion, where he served with distinction for the next 16 years. He started his political career following the French Revolution of 1848 and the establishment of the Second Republic, being elected member of the National Assembly, and soon became one of the leaders of the Moderate Republicans.

As Minister of War in the French provisional government, Cavaignac was tasked with putting down the June Days uprising, a revolt by Parisian workers against the National Assembly, and for this was temporarily given emergency powers. After suppressing the insurrection he renounced his dictatorial powers, and was subsequently confirmed by the National Assembly as the provisional &quot;Chief of the Executive Power&quot; of France, governing for nearly six months until the 1848 presidential election, in which he ran but lost to Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte. He continued to serve as a representative in the National Assembly until its dissolution by the president during the 1851 coup d&#x27;état, and afterwards retired into private life.

==Family and early life==
Cavaignac was born in Paris on 15 October 1802, the second and last child of Jean-Baptiste Cavaignac (1762–1829) and Julie-Marie Olivier de Corancez (1780–1849), who were married in 1797. His elder brother was the republican activist and journalist Éléonore-Louis Godefroi Cavaignac. At the time of his birth, his father was the mayor of Saint-Sauveur, and previously during the French Revolution had been a Jacobin member of the National Convention, where he voted for the execution of Louis XVI. His mother was the member of a wealthy family, prominent in the liberal intellectual circles of Paris, being the daughter of Guillaume Olivier de Corancez, founder of the &quot;Journal de Paris&quot; and a friend of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Through his mother, Cavaignac was a great-grandson of the Genevan &quot;encyclopédiste&quot; Jean Romilly. He and his brother were raised in accordance with the principles established in Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Emile, or On Education&quot;.

Cavaignac entered the École Polytechnique in 1820, then two years left to continue his studies in Metz. Having finished his military education, he joined the Royal Army as a sub-lieutenant of the 2nd regiment of military engineers. Promoted to lieutenant in 1826, he served between 1828 and 1829 in the Morea expedition, the French intervention in the Greek War of Independence. In 1830, upon the outbreak of the July Revolution, Cavaignac, who was stationed in Arras, became one of the first officers to join the revolt against the Bourbon monarchy. He was then promoted to captain in October 1830, under the new July Monarchy.

==Military career in Algeria==
In 1831, Cavaignac was removed from active duty in consequence of his declared republicanism, after he responded negatively to his colonel when questioned if he would obey orders to fight an eventual republican insurrection. He was recalled in 1832 and deployed with the Army of Africa, to serve in the invasion of Algeria. In the first years of the campaign he saw action at Oran (1833), Mascara (1834) and Tlemcen (1836), which earned him praise from his commanding officer, Thomas Bugeaud, who described Cavaignac as &quot;an instructed officer&quot;, whose &quot;high capabilities&quot; made him &quot;ready for great things&quot;. In April 1837 he was given command of a battalion of &quot;zouaves&quot;, and later won special distinction in his fifteen months&#x27; command of the exposed garrison of Tlemcen, a command for which he was selected by Marshal Clauzel, and in the defence of Cherchell in 1840.

In his biography of Cavaignac, Hippolyte Castille remarked that &quot;those who had known general Cavaignac in the battlefield knew what intelligence and energy he deployed in action&quot;. Almost every step of his promotion was gained on the field of battle. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in June 1840, to colonel in August 1841, and to &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; in 1844, the latter on the request of Henri d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Aumale himself, son of King Louis Philippe. As he rose through the ranks in Algeria, Cavaignac&#x27;s correspondence with the republicans in France became increasingly rare. In the last years of the July Monarchy, Cavaignac was appointed governor of the province of Oran, replacing general Lamoricière.

==Early political career==

Following the February 1848 Revolution and the creation of the Republic, Cavaignac was promoted to general of division and was appointed Governor General of Algeria by the French provisional government, succeeding the Duke of Aumale. On 20 March he was offered the office of Minister of War, but refused it in a letter addressed to the provisional government from Algiers, on 27 March. About a month later, Cavaignac returned to France to take his seat as a representative of Lot to the constituent National Assembly, after being the most voted in that department on the 1848 legislative election.

Cavaignac arrived in Paris on 17 May 1848, and on the same day accepted from the Executive Commission the Ministry of War he had previously refused. At the National Assembly he sat among the Moderate Republicans, and there, at the 10 June session, he engaged in a debate with the Bonapartist deputy Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d&#x27;Anthès, which started a lasting antagonism between the general and Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte.

On 23 June, the Executive Commission put Cavaignac in charge of suppressing an armed workers&#x27; insurrection in eastern Paris, which would become known as the June Days. By 24 June, the insurgents posed such a threat that the National Assembly gave Cavaignac dictatorial powers, and disbanded the Executive Committee. Cavaignac viewed the insurrection as a military issue above all else, and thus relied on the regular army with assistance from the National Guard, and did not hesitate to use cannons to break through barricades. When his troops advanced in three strong columns every inch of ground was disputed, and government troops were frequently repulsed, requiring reinforcement by fresh regiments, until he forced his way to the Place de la Bastille and crushed the insurrection at its headquarters. By 26 June the uprising had been put down.

In the view of Cavaignac and other Moderate Republicans in government, the young Republic had just been saved. He had suppressed the revolt with strong determination, but took time in preparing to attack. At the time Alphonse de Lamartine even suspected Cavaignac of having deliberately chosen to delay the government&#x27;s response, allowing the early protests on 23 June to grow, so that his ultimate victory over the insurgents would be more decisive.

==Chief of the Executive Power==

After defeating the insurrection, Cavaignac presented himself before the National Assembly and announced his intention to renounce the dictatorial powers delegated to him, which he did on 28 June. The parliament therefore confirmed him in power as Chief of the Executive Power (&quot;Chef du pouvoir exécutif&quot;). As a committed Republican, Cavaignac strove as head of state of France to secure the democratic institutions recently achieved with the February Revolution, and selected the members of his cabinet accordingly. Many government ministers were also connected to the newspaper &quot;Le National&quot;, the press of the Moderate Republican majority of the National Assembly.

In his early government, Cavaignac imposed control over political clubs and suppressed the left-wing press, which he deemed responsible for inciting the armed insurrection of June. He temporarily prohibited the publication of eleven newspapers, including &quot;Le Père Duchêne&quot;, named after the 1790s radical publication. He would later, in August, indefinitely ban &quot;Le Père Duchêne&quot; along with three other journals for being &quot;instruments of civil war and not of liberty&quot;.
As previously decided by the National Assembly before the June Days, Cavaignac closed down the national workshops in July. Direct relief was provided by the government to supplant the national workshops, and large-scale public works were undertaken in order to reduce unemployment. Cavaignac&#x27;s government gave support to producers&#x27; and workers&#x27; cooperatives, sponsored legislation on maximum working hours for adult factory workers, and promoted the modernization of the French postal system. During this period, with the Chief of the Executive&#x27;s support, a democratic constitution was prepared by the National Assembly.

Unemployment relief was provided while various steps were taken to boost economic recovery and create jobs. According to one study, “Cavaignac’s interest in the workers was attested by the numerous proposals offered by his government in their favor, and by the large number of documents concerning social and economic problems that he preserved in his papers.” Cavaignac supported, for instance, a proposal for government-administered and compulsory sickness and old-age insurance for workers. He believed this was necessary due to industry not providing salaries sufficient enough to allow for adequate savings. His social insurance plan was, however, defeated. 

Measures were taken to improve conditions for workers within the Interior Ministry, while government aid to producers’ cooperatives was implemented. Maximum hours legislation for male factory workers was successfully sponsored by the government. Other labor reforms introduced earlier in 1848, such as the abolition of the “marchandage,” were preserved. The Caviagnac Government also introduced other labor reforms, such as sickness and accident insurance for workers on public works projects. Under this reform, the state paid medical treatment and provided disability payments to injured workers or their survivors. An order was also issued (applying to regulations for state contracts) providing for the wages of workers to be guaranteed in case of an employer’s bankruptcy. Important reforms in public assistance were carried out, while the government also extended a previous labor reform under which workers were given equal representation with employers in the labor courts. Relief was also provided to unemployed people in Paris, at the daily rate of thirty-five centimes per person.

In foreign policy, during a year marked by the Spring of Nations revolutions through much of Europe, Cavaignac essentially maintained the stance previously adopted by the provisional government, of asserting sympathy towards the national movements, specially those in Italy, Germany and Poland, but avoided direct involvement. The worry about internal security and the complex situation abroad prompted a policy of neutrality. The chief concern for his government was the Italian War of Independence, being waged against the Austrian Empire by Piedmont-Sardinia in northern Italy. After the Austrian victory in late July at the Battle of Custoza, Cavaignac organized an army to support Piedmont-Sardinia, but in the absence of a request did not intervene. In contradiction, he also organized, and later cancelled, in November an expeditionary force to rescue Pope Pius IX, who had fled from a republican revolution in Rome.

===Presidential election===

On 8 October, the National Assembly voted to submit the election of a President of the Republic to popular suffrage. As election day approached, increasing evidence suggested that it would most likely be a contest between Cavaignac and Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte. Both leading candidates attempted to gain the support of the conservative Party of Order. With that goal, Cavaignac in October introduced two Orleanists into his cabinet (Vivien and Dufaure) when chance appeared for a ministerial reform, and even indirectly approached Adolphe Thiers, leader of the party, with a proposal for the vice-presidency in his government. Thiers however considered Cavaignac too left-leaning, and the general would not commit himself to the conservatives as much as they wanted him to. He instead preferred Louis-Napoléon, who, according to Thiers, &quot;seems to dissociate himself more from the reds and socialists than does General Cavaignac&quot;.

After much internal debate, the Party of Order decided, on 5 November, not to give their endorsement to any candidate. In this situation Cavaignac&#x27;s supporters had hoped that the party would put forward their own candidate, therefore splitting the popular vote and increasing Cavaignac&#x27;s chances of victory, for in the case of no absolute majority the final decision would be taken by the Assembly, where Cavaignac was backed by the majority. The absence of a third candidate worked for the advantage of Louis-Napoléon, who was the evident favorite of the popular classes. Cavaignac nevertheless was supported by most of the French press, including liberal newspapers such as &quot;Le Siècle&quot; and the &quot;Journal des débats&quot;, which could lead to his potential victory as campaigning was mainly carried out by the press.

Voting took place on 10 and 11 December. As the first results to come in already suggested an imminent victory for Louis-Napoléon, Cavaignac was reportedly urged by his adviser Colonel Charras to carry out a self coup to remain in power, but he refused. To Charras&#x27; argument that giving power to Louis-Napoléon would compromise the Republic, Cavaignac responded, &quot;it is possible that it will succumb, but it will rise again&quot;. Louis-Napoléon won the election with an absolute majority of 74% of the votes cast, with Cavaignac coming in second place with 19.5%. The only four departments not to give the winner a majority of votes were won by Cavaignac; these were in Brittany (Finistère and Morbihan) and Provence (Bouches-du-Rhône and Var). On 20 December a peaceful transfer of power took place in the chamber of the National Assembly. In a brief farewell speech, Cavaignac thanked the parliament for “its confidence and its kindness toward me&quot; and presented the resignation of himself and his cabinet, then proceeded to return to his seat as a member of the Assembly. Armand Marrast, president of the parliament, subsequently proclaimed Louis-Napoléon as President of the Republic.

==Later career==

Cavaignac continued to serve as a representative in the National Assembly for the remainder of the Second Republic. Reelected for Lot but also for Seine in the May 1849 election, he chose to continue to represent Lot and took his seat with the Moderate Republicans on the left. Cavaignac mostly voted with the opposition; he voted against the military expedition sent by the president to suppress the revolutionary Roman Republic, and opposed the law of 31 May 1850, which restricted universal male suffrage, and an 1851 proposal to revise the constitution. The anti-suffrage law of 31 May was approved, and revoking it was used as a pretext by Louis-Napoléon for his coup d&#x27;état of 2 December 1851, in which he seized dictatorial powers and dissolved the National Assembly.

In the early hours of 2 December, Cavaignac was arrested by the police at his house in 9th &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Paris, at the same time as other members of the opposition. First imprisoned in Mazas Prison and later transferred to the Château de Ham, he was soon released on 29 December to marry &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; Odier, a young woman from the Odier banking family, as they were engaged at the time of Cavaignac&#x27;s arrest. He retired from the army after his marriage, and the couple&#x27;s son, Jacques Marie Eugène Godefroy Cavaignac, was born in May 1852. Under the French Empire of Louis-Napoléon (now emperor Napoleon III) which replaced the Republic, he was elected to the Corps législatif, on the 1852 and 1857 elections. On both occasions, however, Cavaignac refused to take the oath of allegiance to the Empire and was therefore barred from taking his seat.

In 1855, Cavaignac bought the &quot;Château d&#x27;Ourne&quot; in Flée, Sarthe. He died at the estate on 28 October 1857, aged 55. His funeral was held in Paris and had as pallbearers his former colleagues Michel Goudchaux, Joseph Guinard, Jules Bastide, and a worker named Bayard. He was buried next to his brother Godefroi in the Montmartre Cemetery, in Paris.

<text>The Laotian Civil War was waged between the Communist Pathet Lao and the Royal Lao Government from 23 May 1959 to 2 December 1975. The Kingdom of Laos was a covert theater during the Vietnam War with both sides receiving heavy external support in a proxy war between the global Cold War superpowers. The fighting also involved the North Vietnamese, South Vietnamese, American and Thai armies, both directly and through irregular proxies. The war is known as the Secret War among the American CIA Special Activities Center, and Hmong and Mien veterans of the conflict.

The Franco–Lao Treaty of Amity and Association (signed 23 October 1953) transferred remaining French powers to the Royal Lao Government (except control of military affairs), establishing Laos as an independent member of the French Union. However, this government did not include representatives from the Lao Issara anti-colonial armed nationalist movement. The following years were marked by a rivalry between the neutralists under Prince Souvanna Phouma, the right wing under Prince Boun Oum of Champassak, and the left-wing Lao Patriotic Front under Prince Souphanouvong and half-Vietnamese future Prime Minister Kaysone Phomvihane. Several attempts were made to establish coalition governments, and a &quot;tri-coalition&quot; government was finally seated in Vientiane.

The North Vietnamese Army, in collaboration with the Pathet Lao, invaded Laos in 1958 and 1959, occupying the east of the country to use for its Ho Chi Minh Trail supply corridor and as a staging area for offensives into South Vietnam. There were two major theatres of the war, one for control over the Laotian Panhandle and the other was fought around the northern Plain of Jars. From 1961 onward, the US trained Hmong tribesmen to disrupt North Vietnamese operations and in 1964, the US began bombing North Vietnamese supply routes.

The North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao eventually emerged victorious in December 1975, following from North Vietnam&#x27;s final victory over South Vietnam in April 1975. The conflict killed tens of thousands of people including many thousands of North Vietnamese soldiers. Unexploded ordnance (UXO), mostly from US bombing, remains a problem. According to the Laotian government in 2017, there were 29,522 deaths and 21,048 injuries from explosive ordnance during the war or as result of UXO since the end of the war.

After the communist takeover in Laos, up to 300,000 people fled to neighbouring Thailand, and Hmong rebels began an insurgency against the new government. The Hmong were persecuted as traitors and &quot;lackeys&quot; of the Americans, with the government and its Vietnamese allies carrying out human rights abuses against Hmong civilians. The incipient conflict between Vietnam and China also played a role with Hmong rebels being accused of receiving support from China. Over 40,000 people died in the conflict. The Lao royal family were arrested by the Pathet Lao and sent to labor camps, where most of them died in the late 1970s and 1980s, including King Savang Vatthana, Queen Khamphoui and Crown Prince Vong Savang.

== Overview ==
The 1954 Geneva Conference established Laotian neutrality. The People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN), however, continued to operate in both northern and southeastern Laos. There were repeated attempts from 1954 onward to force the North Vietnamese out of Laos, but regardless of any agreements or concessions, Hanoi had no intention of withdrawing from the country or abandoning its Laotian communist allies.

North Vietnam established the Ho Chi Minh trail as a paved highway in southeast Laos paralleling the Vietnamese border. The trail was designed to transport North Vietnamese troops and supplies to South Vietnam, as well as to aid the National Liberation Front (Viet Cong).

North Vietnam also had a sizable military effort in northern Laos, while sponsoring and maintaining an indigenous communist rebellion, the Pathet Lao, to put pressure on the Royal Lao Government.

The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in an attempt to disrupt these operations in northern Laos without direct military involvement, responded by training a guerrilla force of about thirty thousand Laotian hill tribesmen, mostly local Hmong (Meo) tribesmen along with the Mien and Khmu, led by Royal Lao Army General Vang Pao, a Hmong military leader. This army, supported by the CIA proprietary airline Air America, Thailand, the Royal Lao Air Force, and a covert air operation directed by the United States ambassador to Laos, fought the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam, the National Liberation Front (NLF), and their Pathet Lao allies to a seesaw stalemate, greatly aiding U.S. interests in the war in Vietnam.

The status of the war in the north throughout the year generally depended on the weather. As the dry season started, in November or December, so did North Vietnamese military operations, as fresh troops and supplies flowed down out of North Vietnam on newly passable routes, either down from Dien Bien Phu, across Phong Saly Province on all-weather highways, or on Route 7 through Ban Ban, Laos on the northeast corner of the Plain of Jars. The CIA&#x27;s covert operation&#x27;s clandestine army would give way, harrying the PAVN and Pathet Lao as they retreated; Raven Forward Air Controllers would direct massive air strikes against the communists by USAF jets and RLAF T-28s to prevent the capture of the Laotian capitals of Vientiane and Luang Prabang. When the rainy season six months later rendered North Vietnamese supply lines impassable, the Vietnamese communists would recede toward Vietnam.

The war in the southeastern panhandle against the Ho Chi Minh Trail was primarily a massive air interdiction program by the USAF and United States Navy because political constraints kept the trail safe from ground assault from South Vietnam. Raven FACs also directed air strikes in the southeast. Other Forward Air Controllers from South Vietnam, such as Covey FACs from the 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron and Nail FACs from the 23rd Tactical Air Support Squadron, also directed strikes. Other air strikes were planned ahead. Overall coordination of the air campaign was directed by an Airborne Command and Control Center, such as those deployed in Operation Igloo White.

The existence of the conflict in Laos was sometimes reported in the U.S., and described in press reports as the CIA&#x27;s &quot;Secret War in Laos&quot; because details were largely unavailable due to official government denials that the war existed. The denials were seen as necessary considering that the North Vietnamese government and the U.S. had both signed agreements specifying the neutrality of Laos. U.S. involvement was considered necessary because North Vietnam had effectively gained control over a large part of the country. Despite these denials, however, the civil war was the largest U.S. covert operation prior to the Soviet–Afghan War, with areas of Laos controlled by North Vietnam subjected to years of intense U.S. aerial bombardment, representing the heaviest bombing campaign in history. Overshadowing it all was the struggle of the Cold War, with the United States&#x27; policy of the containment of communism and the policies of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Soviet Union of spreading communism via subversion and insurgency.

== Chronology of the Laotian Civil War ==
=== 1945: Prelude to war ===

The end of World War II left Laos in political chaos. The French, who had been displaced from their protectorate by the Japanese, wanted to resume control of Laos, and sponsored guerrilla forces to regain control. The Japanese had proclaimed Laos independent even as they lost the war. Though King Sisavang Vong thought Laos was too small for independence, he had proclaimed the end of the French protectorate status while simultaneously favoring the French return. He let it be known he would accept independence if it should occur. Thus there was a nascent movement for independence amid the turmoil.

Underlying all this was a strong undercurrent of Vietnamese involvement. Sixty percent of the population of Laos&#x27; six urban areas were Vietnamese, with the Vietnamese holding key positions in the civil bureaucracies and the police. Since the 1930s the Indochinese Communist Party had established wholly Vietnamese cells in Laos.

Prince Phetsarath Ratanavongsa, as Viceroy and Prime Minister, established the Lao royal treasury account with the Indochinese treasury in Hanoi in an attempt to establish a functional economy.

French commandos parachuted into Laos beginning in 1945 to organize guerrilla forces. By November, they had formed the guerrillas into four light infantry battalions of the newly founded French Union Army. The officers and sergeants of the new Lao battalions were French.

In October 1945, a Lao nationalist movement called Lao Issara (Free Laos) was founded as a new government for Laos. Among Lao Issara&#x27;s prominent members were three European-educated princes; brothers Phetsarath Ratanavongsa and Souvanna Phouma, and their half brother, Souphanouvong. The former became the titular founder of Lao Issara. Souphanouvong became commander in chief, as well as minister of foreign affairs. Souvanna Phouma became minister of public works.

Independence began with an uprising of the Vietnamese residents in Savannakhet. Prince Souphanouvong took command of a band of partisans armed with weapons looted from the local militia. The band moved northward to the administrative capitol of Vientiane with its provisional revolutionary government. Souphanouvong then urged the signing of a military cooperation treaty with the newly established North Vietnamese communist government, which was done. The French military mission was escorted out of Laos into Thailand by a contingent of Chinese troops.

However, the Lao Issara never gained more than a tenuous hold on the entirety of Laos. Roving Viet Minh detachments ruled the northeast, but the Viet Minh declined to aid the new government. Chinese troops, including the Chinese Nationalist 93rd Division, occupied cities as far south as Luang Prabang. The French-sponsored guerrillas controlled the southern provinces of Savannakhet and Khammouan. Prince Boun Oum, who sympathized with the French, occupied the rest of the southern panhandle.

For these, and other reasons, Lao Issara could not hold the country against the returning French colonial government and its troops. The French negotiated a Chinese withdrawal from Laos prior to their own return, removing them from the field.

=== 1946: French return; Vietnamese arrive ===

In January 1946, the French began the reconquest of Laos by sweeping the Bolovens Plateau. They had organized six battalions of light infantry, to which they added a minor force of French troops.

On 21 March 1946, Souphanouvong and his largely Vietnamese force fought the French Union troops at Savannakhet, to no avail; the attackers mustered paratroopers, artillery, armored cars, and Spitfire fighter-bombers. The Lao Issara troops suffered 700 killed. They fled, leaving behind 250 bodies and 150 prisoners.

On 24 April, the French dropped a paratroop battalion on the outskirts of Vientiane, and took the city without resistance. On 9 May, they repeated their airborne tactics with a drop outside Luang Prabang. This was coupled with a thrust to the north by the French forces, from Vientiane to Luang Prabang, that chased Phetsarath Ratanavongsa and the Lao Issara ministers out of Laos. The king reinstated the French rule by repudiating his actions that had been pressured from him by the Japanese, Chinese, and Lao Issara.

By September 1946, the Lao Issara had been defeated and had fled to exile in Bangkok. One of its splinter groups, led by Thao O Anourack, fled to Hanoi.
There he allied himself with two men trusted by Ho Chi Minh; Nouhak Phoumsavanh was Vietnamese, and Kaysone Phomvihane was Vietnamese-Lao. These three men founded the military movement that would become the Pathet Lao (Land of Laos).

Thao O Anourack established the initial Pathet Lao base at Con Cuong, Vietnam. Kaysone Phomvihane organized the first detachment of the new force. By the end of 1946, at least 500 Viet Minh agents had crossed into Laos.

=== 1947–1952: Build-up of forces ===
On 11 May 1947, King Sisavang Vong granted a constitution declaring Laos an independent nation within the French Union. This began the building of a new government over the next few years, including the establishment of a national army, the Armée Nationale Laotienne, which was the first iteration of the Royal Lao Army.

The nascent army was plagued by lack of Lao leadership, and its weaponry was a hodgepodge. Thus
the new Armée Nationale Laotienne consisted of light infantry battalions officered by the French. There was one paratroop battalion included. The French began training Lao officers and non-commissioned officers even as they continued to lead and train the new army.

In opposition, the Viet Minh raised a subsidiary revolutionary movement, the Pathet Lao, starting with an initial guerrilla band of 25 in January 1949.

In October 1949, the exiled Lao Issara dissolved and the three royal brothers each chose a separate destiny.

Phetsarath Rattanavongsa chose to remain in Bangkok. His stay was temporary. He would once again become the viceroy of Laos.

Souvanna Phouma chose to return to Laos via an amnesty, believing that the Lao would soon free themselves. In 1951 he became Prime Minister for the first time and held that office until 1954.

Souphanouvong, who had spent seven years in Nha Trang during his sixteen years in Vietnam, met Ho Chi Minh and acquired a Vietnamese wife while in Vietnam, and he solicited Viet Minh aid in founding a guerrilla force.

In August 1950, Souphanouvong had joined the Viet Minh in their headquarters north of Hanoi, Vietnam, and become the head of the Pathet Lao, along with its political arm dubbed Neo Lao Hak Sat (Lao Patriotic Front). This was an attempt to give a false front of authority to the Lao communist movement by claiming to represent a united non-partisan effort. Two of its most important founders were members of the Indochinese Communist Party, which advocated overthrow of the monarchy as well as expulsion of the French. This got Laos involved in the First Indochina War, but it started off mainly against the French.

On 23 December 1950, the Pentalateral Mutual Defense Assistance Pact was signed by the United States, France, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos; it was a tool to transfer American military aid to the French war effort in Indochina. This year also marked the infiltration of at least 5,000 more Viet Minh into Laos.

In February 1951, the Indochinese Communist Party decided to split in three to sponsor war against the French in Cambodia and Laos, along with the war in Vietnam. The new Laotian branch consisted of 2,091 members, but included only 31 Lao.

Also, by 1951, the Pathet Lao had mustered sufficient trained troops to join the Viet Minh in military operations.

By October 1951, the Armée Nationale Laotienne had raised two more battalions of infantry and began training a battalion of paratroops. The ANL ended the year with a strength of 5,091.

By the end of 1952, the Royal Lao Army had grown to include a battalion of troops commanded by Laotian officers, as well as 17 other companies.

=== 1953–1954: First North Vietnamese invasion and French defeat ===
In April 1953, the Viet Minh&#x27;s People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) invaded the northeastern part of what was still the French Protectorate of Laos with 40,000 troops commanded by General Võ Nguyên Giáp; including 2,000 Pathet Lao soldiers led by Souphanouvong. The objective of the two-pronged invasion was the capture of the royal capital of Luang Prabang and of the Plain of Jars. On 9 November the Pathet Lao began its conflict with the Kingdom of Laos, thus beginning the civil war and technically the Second Indochina War while the First Indochina War was still ongoing.

They were opposed by 10,000 Lao troops and 3,000 French regulars.

The North Vietnamese invaders succeeded in conquering the border provinces of Phongsali and Xam Neua, which were adjacent to northern Vietnam and on the northeastern verge of the Plain of Jars. They then moved aside to allow the Pathet Lao force with its mismatched scrounged equipment to occupy the captured ground, and Souphanouvong moved the Pathet Lao headquarters into Xam Neua on 19 April.

The other strike, moving from Điện Biên Phủ and aimed downriver at Luang Prabang, was thwarted by oncoming monsoons and resistance by the French.
The Vietnamese invasion was stalled, but only because the French had airlifted in battalions of Foreign Legionnaires and Moroccan Tirailleurs.

In December, the French Union Army, as part of its attempt to protect Laos from the PAVN, recaptured the Dien Bien Phu valley.

In January 1954, the PAVN launched two assaults on Laos. One thrust crossed the top of the panhandle to the Mekong River town of Thakhek. The other was again aimed at Luang Prabang. Both were thwarted in a month.

These were diversions to the famous Battle of Dien Bien Phu, which took place from March through May 1954 within ten kilometers of the Lao border, on the lines of communication into the Plain of Jars. The ruggedness of the karst mountains of northern Laos channels movement into a few canyons; small watercraft could move from Điện Biên Phủ down to the Nam Ou, and thence directly downriver to Luang Prabang, or they cross into the PDJ via
Ban Ban.

The United States used Civil Air Transport, which later morphed into Air America, in a covert operation to fly supplies to the embattled French in Điện Biên Phủ. The PAVN also launched a diversionary thrust at Seno, Laos aimed at cutting away the panhandle from the main body of Laos. This thrust was foiled by paratroopers from the French Union&#x27;s Army of the Republic of Vietnam.

When the relief troops failed to lift the siege in time, the French and their local allies lost the bastion of Điện Biên Phủ. One of the troopers in the relief column marching from Luang Prabang was a young Hmong named Vang Pao.

The French loss at Điện Biên Phủ marked the end of the First Indochina War; the French were driven to negotiate for peace. On 20 July, the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos was signed, ending French rule. Two months later, the North Vietnamese established a support group for Pathet Lao forces at Ban Nameo, well within northeastern Laos.

The Agreement radically changed the geography of Indochina, resulting in independence for Laos. On 1 August 1954 the French army withdrew from Laos declaring independence for the nation alongside North Vietnam, South Vietnam and Cambodia which ended the First Indochina War but the Laotian Civil War was still ongoing. The northern half of Vietnam became independent of the French imperialist enterprise and was ruled by an independent Vietnamese Communist government. Lao French Union troops joined the military of independent Laos, however France kept two military bases in Laos and maintained its &quot;military advisors&quot; in the new Lao military. The Royal Lao government military also received its first aircraft from the French in 1954; nine Morane-Saulnier MS-500 Criquets were supplied for support and medevac.

=== 1955–1958: The lull ===
In January, 1955, French advisors began training the first Lao aviation force. Later that year, Thailand would supply Sikorsky H-19 helicopters and volunteer pilots to the Lao military. The Thais also trained thirty Lao officers in weapons use at Hua Hin, Thailand.

In early 1955, a United States Operation Mission was set up in Laos. Its primary purpose was supply of military defense materials to the Royal Lao Government; 80% of its budget was dedicated to this purpose. The United States paid 100% of the Lao military budget. However, the embassy staff was not up to monitoring this program. There was an obvious need for a Military Assistance Advisory Group; however, the United States had signed a treaty that expressly forbade such.

U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s solution was to establish the Programs Evaluation Office (PEO) in December, 1955, staffed by American civilians with prior military experience and headed up by retired Brigadier General Rothwell Brown. These civilians were given U.S. State Department status. However, they did not work strictly for the State Department. On military matters, they reported to the Commander in Chief Pacific Command, with information supplied to the American ambassador; on non-military matters, they reported directly to the ambassador.

1955 was also notable for the despatch of Royal Lao Government troops to Sam Neua and Phong Saly, which was much resented by the Pathet Lao. As a result of this resentment, and disputes about electoral procedures, the Laotian communists boycotted that year&#x27;s national elections.

On 21 March 1956, Souvanna Phouma began his second term as prime minister. He opened a dialogue with his brother, Souphanouvong. In August, they announced the intention of declaring a ceasefire and reintegrating the Pathet Lao and their occupied territory into the government. However, the Pathet Lao claimed the right to administer the provinces they occupied.

At the same time, they and their North Vietnamese backers ran a massive recruitment campaign, with the aim of forming nine battalions of troops. Many of the new recruits were sent into North Vietnam for schooling and training. This led to United States concern that the Royal Lao Army would be inadequately equipped and trained because there was only one small French military mission working with the RLA.

In February, 1957, the PEO personnel began supplying training materials to the French Military Mission that was charged with training the Royal Lao Army. The rationale was that improved training would better fit the army with defending its country. As part of this process, the United States even took over paying the Royal Lao Army&#x27;s salaries.

Beginning in March, 1957, the Royal Lao Army began shuttling arms to Hmong guerrillas, to enable them to fight on the side of the RLA.

In November, 1957, a coalition government incorporating the Pathet Lao was finally established. Using the slogan, &quot;one vote to the right, one vote to the left to prevent civil war&quot;, pro-communist parties received one-third of the popular vote and won 13 of 21 contested seats in the elections of 4 May 1958. With these additional seats, the left controlled a total of 16 seats in the 59 member National Assembly. Combined with independents, this was enough to deny Souvanna&#x27;s center right, neutralist coalition the two-thirds majority it needed to form a government. With parliament deadlocked, the U.S. suspended aid in June to force a devaluation of the overpriced currency, which was leading to the abuse of U.S. aid. The National Assembly responded by confirming a right-wing government led by Phuy Xananikôn in August. This government included four members of the U.S.-backed Committee for the Defence of the National Interest (none of them National Assembly members). Three more unelected CDNI members were added in December, when Phuy received emergency powers to govern without the National Assembly.

In November 1958, Brigadier General John A. Heintges reviewed the PEO. He promptly replaced General Brown and forged a new agreement with the Lao and the French. Integral to the new agreement was the displacement of the French military trainers by Americans. As a result, PEO expanded over twentyfold. Included in the expansion were 149 Special Forces on temporary duty, and 103 Filipino military veterans working for a newly formed front company named Eastern Construction Company in Laos.

=== 1959: Second North Vietnamese invasion ===
On 15 May 1959, the PAVN established Group 559; this unit was charged with the logistics of moving the necessities of war from North Vietnam to the South. Its foremost feat was building and maintaining the Ho Chi Minh trail down the eastern spine of Laos. Eventually, this transportation network would power the Vietnamese communists to victory. It would have to survive a relentless air campaign comparable to any interdiction bombing in World War II.

According to assistant secretary of state Roger Hilsman, if the communists Pathet Laos regular forces assisted by medium sized NVA forces successfully overthrew the Kingdom of Laos government before the mid-1960s, then other SE Asian nations feared the massive revolutionary communists expansions from town to town illusioning the domino effect.

Also in May, the long-awaited integration of 1,500 Pathet Lao troops into the national army was scheduled. The U.S. embassy told the Lao government that it would be difficult to gain congressional approval of aid to Laos with communists serving in the army. The Pathet Lao stalled.

The North Vietnamese government (Hanoi) deployed about 30,000-40,000 NVA soldiers to penetrate northern Laos to assist the battalions of Pathet Laos forces beyond major military campaigns.

Under orders from Souphanouvong, the Pathet Lao battalions refused to be integrated into the Royal Lao Army. Souphanouvong was then arrested and imprisoned, along with his aides. The two Pathet Lao battalions, one after the other, escaped during the night with no shots fired, taking their equipment, families, and domestic animals with them. On 23 May, Souphanouvong and his companions also escaped unscathed.

In July, U.S. Special Forces Mobile Training Teams from the 77th Special Forces Group, working under the code name Hotfoot, began training the Royal Laotian army. The Green Berets were attached to the Programs Evaluation Office, and like other PEO employees, were nominal civilians and dressed as such.

The RLA was being formed into Groupement Mobilesregimental-sized units of three battalions. The training teams were assigned one per GM, with some battalions also meriting a team.

On 28 July, PAVN units attacked all along the North Vietnamese-Lao border. As they took ground from the Royal Lao Army, they moved in Pathet Lao as occupation troops. Poor battle performance by the RLA seemed to verify the need for further training; the RLA outnumbered the attackers, but still gave ground.

Also in July, the American embassy began to contract for aerial resupply for RLA troops, hiring Robert Brongersma and his Beech 18.

In September, Group 100 was succeeded by Group 959; the North Vietnamese were upgrading their military mission to the Pathet Lao, just as the Americans had expanded PEO. Both sides were raising larger client armies, in hopes the Lao would fight.

=== 1960: The neutralist coup ===
On 9 August 1960, Captain Kong Le and his Special Forces-trained Neutralist paratrooper battalion were able to seize control of the administrative capital of Vientiane in a virtually bloodless coup, while Prime Minister Tiao Samsanith, government officials, and military leaders met in Luang Prabang. His stated aim for the coup was an end to fighting in Laos, the end of foreign interference in his country, an end to the consequent corruption caused by foreign aid, and better treatment for his soldiers. However, Kong Le&#x27;s coup did not end opposition to him, and there was a scramble among unit commanders to choose sides. If one was not pro-coup, then he had the further decision to make as to whom he would back to counter the coup. The front runner was General Phoumi Nosavan, first cousins with the prime minister of Thailand, Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat.

With CIA support, Field Marshal Sarit set up a covert Thai military advisory group, called Kaw Taw. Kaw Taw supported a counter-coup against the new Neutralist Lao government in Vientiane, supplying artillery, artillerymen, and advisers to Phoumi&#x27;s forces. It also committed the CIA-sponsored Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit (PARU) to operations within Laos.

Alongside its covert Kaw Taw operation, immediately after Kong Le&#x27;s coup the government of Thailand began an embargo via land blockade, cutting off the main source of imported goods for Vientiane. The United States Secretary of State, Christian Herter, stated that the United States supported the &quot;legitimate government under the King&#x27;s direction.&quot; The United States supported the pro-Western government of Prime Minister Tiao Samsanith while at the same time the CIA supported the covert counter-coup effort organized by Sarit against the Neutralist government in Vientiane.

The Neutralist forces in Vientiane organized the executive committee of the High Command of the Revolution as the interim government in Laos the following day. General Phoumi Nosavan, stated on 10 August that he planned to retake Vientiane by force. The United States Ambassador to Laos, Winthrop G. Brown, responded to General Phoumi by stating that the United States supported a restoration of peace &quot;through quick and decisive action.&quot;

PEO had turned its support to General Phoumi. With the help of Air America and covert aid from Thailand, the general and his troops moved north toward Vientiane from Savannakhet in southern Laos, in November.

The Soviet Union began a military air bridge into Vientiane in early December; it was characterized as the largest Soviet airlift since World War II. This air bridge flew in PAVN artillery and gunners to reinforce the Neutralist/Pathet Lao coalition.

On their side, the United States flew four B-26 Invader bombers from Taiwan into Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, poised to strike into Laos. They were later joined by an additional eight B26s. With a dozen guns, half a dozen rockets, and a napalm canister apiece, they were a potent threat, but were never used.

On 13 December, Phoumi&#x27;s army began a three-day bombardment of Vientiane. Five hundred civilians and seventeen of Kong Le&#x27;s paratroopers were killed by the shellfire. On the 14th, a U.S. carrier task force went on alert, and the Second Airborne Brigade stood by to seize selected Laotian airfields. The U.S. was poised to rescue its paramilitary and diplomatic advisers in Laos.

Kong Le and his Neutralists finally withdrew northward to the Plain of Jars. Their withdrawal was covered by artillery fire from the PAVN 105 mm howitzers rushed in from Hanoi, and supported by Soviet airdrops of crucial supplies of rations, munitions, and radios. In the retreat, Kong Le picked up 400 recruits, swelling his force to 1,200 men.

Phoumi&#x27;s coup was thus successful, but the result was the alliance of the Neutralists with the Pathet Lao on 23 December. As 1960 ended, the nation of Laos had become an arena of confrontation for the world&#x27;s superpowers.

=== 1961: Superpowers&#x27; involvement deepens ===
Beginning on 1 January, a new coalition of Kong Le&#x27;s Neutralists, Pathet Lao, and PAVN drove 9,000 Royal Lao Army troops from the Plain of Jars.

On 3 January, the Royal Laotian Air Force (RLAF) received its first counter-insurgency aircraft, American-built T-6 Texans, via the Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF). These four reconfigured trainers were armed with two .30 caliber machine guns and five-inch rockets, and could carry 100-pound bombs. Four previously trained Lao pilots undertook transition training in Thailand; on 9 January, the pilots flew the new RLAF fighter-bombers to Vientiane. Two days later, they flew their first combat sorties, against PAVN and Pathet Lao covering Kong Le&#x27;s retreat into the Plain of Jars.

Russian Soviet air supply continued, bringing in heavy weapons to supplement the light arms previously delivered. On 7 January, the North Vietnamese presence was escalated by an additional four battalions; two of the battalions immediately moved to the point of conflict, on Route 7, which connected to Vientiane. A third PAVN battalion moved into action at Tha Thom, south of the Plain of Jars. On 15 January, the entire 925th Independent Brigade of the PAVN had crossed into Laos to reinforce the Pathet Lao/Neutralist coalition.

The U.S. decided to counter-escalate by airdropping arms to a force of 7,000 Hmong guerrillas later in the month. The U.S. Navy transferred four H-34 helicopters to Air America.

By the beginning of February 1961, the first four Thai pilots arrived to fly four more T-6s supplied to the Royal Laotian Air Force (RLAF). The Thai pilots had been officially discharged from the Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) and held no official position in the RLAF. The growth of the RLAF would be nullified by its casualties, as five of the T-6s were lost in action by the end of March.

An inter-agency task force set up by the incoming Kennedy administration in early February undertook a two-month study of possible American responses to the Laotian civil war. Even as the French ended their training mission, American training efforts were ramped up: Sixteen H-34 helicopters were transferred from the U.S. Marine Corps to Air America; maintenance facilities were established at Udorn in northern Thailand, about 85 kilometres south of Vientiane. The most drastic alternative the task force envisioned was a 60,000-man commitment of American ground troops in southern Laos, with a possible use of nuclear weapons. These latter options were not elected.

On 9 March, the communists captured the only road junction between Luang Prabang and Vientiane. When RLA troops were ordered to counterattack and retake the junction, they dropped their weapons and ran. Special Forces Team Moon was assigned as advisers to the RLA unit. On 22 April 1961, Team Moon was overrun. Two sergeants were killed, and team leader Captain Walter H. Moon was captured; he was later executed while trying to escape captivity. Another sergeant was released sixteen months later.

The Operation Millpond B-26s had been scheduled to strike at Kong Le, but the strike was stayed by an event on the far side of the world. The Bay of Pigs Invasion failed, and that failure gave pause to U.S. actions in Laos. A ceasefire was sought. Simultaneously, the PEO shed its civilian guise and went above ground to become a Military Advisory Assistance Group. Emblematic of the change, the Hotfoot teams donned their U.S. uniforms and became White Star Mobile Training Teams.

The truce supposedly went into effect the first week of May, but was repeatedly breached by the communists. With the Royal Lao Army ineffective, the Hmong guerrillas were left as the only opposition to the communists. In early June, they were forced from their beleaguered position at the Ban Padong by an artillery barrage followed by a ground assault. Under command of General Vang Pao, they fell back to Long Tieng.

The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency had begun secretly recruiting Lao montagnards into 100-man militia companies. Riflemen trained for these militias would receive eight weeks basic training, then serve several months in their militia. Once they had that experience, which often included their first combat, they were further recruited into battalions of irregular troops called Special Guerrilla Units. The battalions were filled out along ethnic lines, most being Hmong, but some being Yao (Iu-Mien) or Lao Theung (Lao Saetern). SGUs, once formed up, underwent three further months training by Thai officers and sergeants in Phitsanuloke, Thailand.

By summer, the CIA had mustered 9,000 hill tribesmen into the ranks of the Armée Clandestine. It was aided by nine CIA agents, nine Special Forces augmenters, and 99 Thai Special Forces troopers from the Police Aerial Resupply Unit.

By autumn, the future course of American involvement was set. Paramilitary trainers would train guerrilla units, with resupply coming via airdrops, and specialized short takeoff and landing aircraft using makeshift dirt airstrips. Other trainers would try to mold the Royalist regulars into a fighting force. Fighter-bombers would serve as flying artillery to blast the communist forces into retreat or submission.

In December, the Royalists decided to assert control over the provincial capital of Nam Tha, which was on the northwestern border, almost in southern China. Laotian Army Groupement Mobiles (GMs) 11 and 18 were stationed there, and soon came under pressure from the communists.

=== 1962: Disaster and a new government ===
By February, the Royal Lao Government&#x27;s hold on Nam Tha seemed tenuous enough that it was reinforced by the paratroopers of GM 15. That gave a numerical edge to the defenders and should have guaranteed Nam Tha&#x27;s retention. The presence of armed American Special Forces advisors should have stiffened them with military expertise. In May, a PAVN assault broke the RLG forces and routed them. The Royalist soldiers fled southward across the entirety of northwestern Laos into Thailand, a retreat of over a hundred miles.

Faced with this fiasco, the U.S. and other foreign powers pressured the RLG into a coalition with the Pathet Lao and Kong Le&#x27;s Forces Armee Neutrale. The International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos signed on July 23, 1962, in Geneva, Switzerland as intention for the respect Laos neutrality to attempt the cessation of civil war. This technically fulfilled the Geneva Agreements on Laos and triggered the treaty requirement that foreign military technicians be withdrawn from Laos by October. The United States disbanded its Military Assistance Advisory Group and withdrew its military mission. The Vietnamese communists did not; they repatriated only a token 40 technicians out of an estimated 2,000.

Several companies of hill tribes irregulars were sent to Hua Hin, Thailand for training.

=== 1963: Stasis ===
By the middle of the year, the Pathet Lao and Neutralists had begun to squabble with one another. The neutralist group was soon divided between right-leaning neutralists (headed by Kong Le) and left-leaning neutralists (headed by Quinim Polsena and Colonel Deuane Sunnalath). On 12 February 1963 Kong Le&#x27;s second in command, Colonel Ketsana, was assassinated. Shortly afterwards Quinim Polsena and his deputy were also assassinated. The neutralist camp was split with some going over to the Pathēt Lao. Fighting between the Pathet Lao and government troops soon resumed.

Vang Pao gathered three SGU battalions into Groupement Mobile 21 and spearheaded a drive into Sam Neua against the Pathet Lao. His offensive was resupplied by supplies airdropped by the civilian aircraft of Air America and Bird and Sons.

In the meantime, the United States re-established a Military Assistance Advisory Group to support its efforts in Laos, basing it in Bangkok. The Requirements Office of the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane was manned by civilians and monitored the need for U.S. military aid to Laos.

In August, the Royal Laotian Air Force received its first four T-28 Trojans that had been adapted for counter-insurgency warfare.

The irregular companies trained the previous year in Thailand were now formed into a battalion called SGU 1. Irregular forces proliferated throughout the country. In Military Regions 3 and 4, action, intelligence, and road watch teams infiltrated the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

In December, Vang Pao was promoted to Brigadier General by King Sisavong.

=== 1964–1965: Escalation and U.S. Air Force involvement ===

On 1 April, the USAF set up Project Waterpump, which was a pilot training program at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base to supply Lao pilots for the Royal Laotian Air Force. The RLAF also began augmenting its ranks with Thai volunteer pilots in 1964.

Run by a 41-man team from Detachment 6 of the 1st Air Commando Wing, this facility was an end run around the treaty obligation that forbade training in Laos. Besides training pilots, Waterpump encouraged cooperation between the RLAF and the Royal Thai Air Force. It was also tasked, as a last resort, to augment the RLAF to counter a renewed Communist offensive in Laos.

In Laos itself, there was an effort to train Laotians as forward air guides. Meantime, the Butterfly forward air control program began.

Even as the air commandos established themselves in Udorn and Laos, several Lao generals attempted a coup in Vientiane. With the capital in turmoil, the Communists on the Plain of Jars attacked and overran the Royalist and Neutralist positions. The United States then released the necessary ordnance for the RLAF to bomb Communist encampments, beginning on 18 May.

On 19 May, the United States Air Force began flying mid and low-level missions over the renewed fighting, under the code name Yankee Team. They also began reconnaissance missions over the Laotian panhandle to obtain target information on men and material being moved into South Vietnam over the Ho Chi Minh Trail. By this time, the footpaths on the trail had been enlarged to truck roads, with smaller paths for bicycles and walking. The Trail had become the major artery for use by North Vietnam to infiltrate South Vietnam.

On 9 June, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered an F-100 strike against the enemy in retaliation for the shoot down of another U.S. aircraft.

The summer of 1964 was marked by a successful attack by the Forces Armee Royale. Operation Triangle cleared one of the few roads in Laos; Route 13 connected the administrative capitol of Vientiane with the royal capitol of Luang Prabang.

The Plain of Jars activities expanded by December 1964, were named Operation Barrel Roll, and were under the control of the U.S. ambassador to Laos, who approved all targets before they were attacked.

==== Operations Steel Tiger and Tiger Hound ====

1965 began with an event that showed how the commanding generals of the five military regions of Laos were essentially warlords of their own domains.

In February, Commanding General of Military Region 5 Kouprasith Abhay mounted a coup against the group of generals who had attempted a coup the previous year. Among the losers fleeing into exile were General Phoumi Nosavan.

On 3 April, the U.S. began Operation Steel Tiger over the Laotian panhandle and the Vietnamese DMZ to locate and destroy enemy forces and materiel being moved southward at night on the Ho Chi Minh Trail into South Vietnam. However, since circumstances made it a highly complex matter in regard to the apparent neutrality of Laos, target approval had to come from the U.S. government in Washington, D.C.. Additionally, the U.S. ambassadors in South Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand were involved in controlling these U.S. air operations.

Late in 1965, the communists greatly increased their infiltration along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The United States decided to concentrate airpower upon a small segment of the Trail closest to South Vietnam and used most extensively by the enemy. As a result, Operation Tiger Hound was initiated in December 1965, utilizing aircraft from the Air Force, the United States Navy and U.S. Marines, the Vietnamese Air Force, and the Royal Laotian Air Force. On 11 December, B-52 heavy bombers were called in to this tactical operation, in their first use over Laos.

From 1965 to 1973, the civil war moved back and forth in northern Laos, characterized by short but often very intense engagements.

=== 1966–1967 ===


In the far northwest, Team Fox, an intelligence team of Mien hill tribesmen began long range reconnaissance of southern China.

In July, Royal Lao Government (RLG) forces seized the Nam Bac Valley. Three Infantry Regiments, one independent infantry battalion, and one artillery battalion took Nam Bac and established a defensive line north of Luang Prabang.

On the Plain of Jars, the Pathet Lao advance gradually slowed due to the destruction of its supplies by airpower, and Laotian troops then counter-attacked. By August 1966, they had advanced to within 45 miles of the DRV border. North Vietnam then sent thousands of its regular troops into the battle and once again the Laotians were forced to retreat.

&quot;Steel Tiger&quot; operations continued down the length of the panhandle in 1966, with special emphasis upon the &quot;Tiger Hound&quot; area. Since most of the communist truck traffic was at night, the Air Force developed and began using special equipment to detect the nighttime traffic.

In eastern Laos, U.S., Royal Laotian, and VNAF aircraft continued their attacks on traffic along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. During 1967, B-52s flew 1,718 sorties in this area, almost triple their 1966 record. The major targets were trucks which had to be hunted down and destroyed one-by-one. This seemed to be irrational thinking to many Americans flying these combat missions for these trucks could have been destroyed en masse before, during, or after their unloading from the freighters that had hauled them to North Vietnam if bombing of Haiphong had been permitted. The presence of Soviet, British, Greek and Panamanian neutral ships in Haiphong prevented any United States bombing for the duration of the war.

In northern Laos, the Communists continued their slow advance across the Plain of Jars in 1967. Laotian victories were few and far between, and by the end of the year, the situation had become critical even with the air support which had been provided by the Royal Lao Air Force.

Laotian tribal irregulars were operating out of Nam Bac, under CIA direction from Luang Prabang, some 60 miles south of the guerrilla base. In midyear, over the objections of Lao colonels, American advisors pressured Royal Lao troops into forming their smaller units into combat battalions. Despite the poor training of the Lao soldiers, some of whom had never fired a weapon, these raw new units were moved northward out of Luang Prabang over a several month period to garrison Nam Bac. By mid-October, some 4,500 government troops held the valley to secure the air strip for their resupply. The American intent was the establishment of Nam Bac as the keystone of an &quot;iron arc&quot; of defensive positions across northern Laos.

In response, the PAVN 316th Infantry Division was dispatched to Laos to assault Nam Bac. The Royalist garrison was soon surrounded. They had American-supplied 105 mm howitzers for artillery support. They could also call on Royal Lao Air Force T-28s for close air support. U.S. Air Force fighter-bombers struck the Communist supply lines. Communist gunfire closed the Nam Bac airstrip to fixed wing resupply. Air America copters flew in supplies and evacuated the wounded; American C-123s parachuted supplies ferried from Udorn RTAFB to the beleaguered government troops. The Royalist troops would not launch a clearing attack to regain use of the runway for resupply. On 25 December, a Vietnamese artillery barrage kicked off their offensive.

=== 1968: Royal Lao Army neutralized ===
On 13 January the North Vietnamese launched a multi-division attack on the Royal Lao Army at Nam Bac, Laos. Some of the government troops began withdrawing from the valley. After about a third of the defenders had retreated, the final assault on the Royalist garrison came out of a heavy mist and hit the Royalist command post. Its communications with the defenders was cut; the rout was on. The heavy weapons and scale of the PAVN attack could not be matched by the national army and it was effectively sidelined for several years.

Most of the government soldiers scattered into the surrounding hills; about 200 of the defenders were killed in action. Of the 3,278 Royalist soldiers, only about a third returned to government service. The Royalists had suffered such a staggering defeat that their army never recovered; the government was left with only tribal irregulars using guerrilla tactics fighting on its side.

Throughout 1968, the communists slowly advanced across the northern part of Laos, defeating Laotian forces time and time again. An important U.S. navigation aids site fell in the Battle of Lima Site 85 on 10 March 1968. This success was achieved despite U.S. military advice and assistance. In November, the U.S. launched an air campaign against the Ho Chi Minh Trail because North Vietnam was sending more troops and supplies than ever along this route to South Vietnam. This new operation, named Operation Commando Hunt, continued until 1972, with little success.

=== 1969–1972 ===
On 23 March 1969, the Royal Lao Army launched a large attack against the communists in the Plain of Jars/Xieng Khoang areas, supported by its own air units and the U.S. Air Force (Operation Raindance). In June, Pathet Lao and PAVN launched an attack of its own and gained ground; but by August, Royal Laotian forces attacked again and regained what had been lost, recovering the Plain of Jars in September 1969 in the Kou Kiet Campaign. In all these operations, the U.S. Air Force flew hundreds of &quot;Barrel Roll&quot; missions; however, many were canceled because of poor weather.

Pathet Lao forces were supported by PAVN&#x27;s 174th Vietnamese Volunteer Regiment. By September 1969, the 174th had to fall back to regroup. North Vietnamese forces participating in the campaign included the 316th and 312th Infantry Divisions, the 866th Infantry Regiment, the 16th Artillery Regiment, one tank company, six sapper and engineer battalions, one Nghệ An province local force battalion, and ten PL battalions.

On 11 February 1970, a PAVN and Pathet Lao offensive (part of Campaign 139) opened. By the 20th, control of the Plain of Jars was secure. RLG forces withdrew to Muong Xui. On 25 February, the RLG abandoned Xieng Khoang city. Xam Thong fell on 18 March and Long Tieng was threatened. On 25 April, the campaign ended, with PAVN forces mostly withdrawing from the Plain of Jars; according to Vietnamese sources, after the end of the campaign, the &quot;316th Division, the 866th Regiment, and a number of specialty branch units were ordered to stay behind to work with our Lao friends.&quot;

At the beginning of 1970, fresh troops from North Vietnam advanced through northern Laos. The Air Force called in B-52s and, on 17 February, they were used to bomb targets in northern Laos. The enemy advance was halted by Laotian reinforcements, and for the remainder of the year it was a &quot;seesaw&quot; military campaign.

On 1 May, elements of SVN PAVN units (28th and 24A regiments) joined with North Vietnamese Army and Pathet Lao to seize Attapeu.

Although communist movements down the Ho Chi Minh Trail grew during the year, the U.S. war effort was reduced because authorities in Washington, believing the U.S. objectives in Southeast Asia were being achieved, imposed budget limits, which reduced the number of combat missions the USAF could fly.

Because of significant logistical stockpiling by PAVN in the Laotian Panhandle, South Vietnam launched Operation Lam Son 719, a military thrust on 8 February 1971. Its goals were to cross into Laos toward the city of Tchepone and cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail, hopefully thwarting a planned North Vietnamese offensive. Aerial support by the U.S. was massive since no American ground units could participate in the operation. On 25 February, PAVN launched a counterattack, and in the face of heavy opposition, the South Vietnamese force withdrew from Laos after losing approximately a third of its men.

On 18 December, PAVN and Pathet Lao forces launched counteroffensive (Campaign Z) to recover the Plain of Jars. Volunteer forces included the 312th and 316th Divisions, the 335th and 866th Infantry Regiments, and six artillery and tank battalions. Xam Thong fell and the push continued toward Long Tieng.

Lower Laos – the 968th Infantry Regiment and Pathet Lao forces reclaimed the Tha Teng and Lao Nam areas, and captured the Bolaven Plateau.
During the dry season 1971–72, PL/PAVN forces dug into defensive positions and fought for permanent control of the Plain of Jars. Units participating included the 316th Infantry Division, the 866th, 335th, and 88th Regiments, and nine specialty branch battalions under the command of Senior Colonel Le Linh. Seven PL battalions also participated.

On 21 May, RLG forces attempted to seize the Plain. The battle lasted 170 days (until 15 November 1972). The communists claimed to have killed 1,200 troops and captured 80.

When PAVN launched the &quot;Nguyễn Huệ Offensive&quot; (known in the West as the Easter Offensive) into South Vietnam on 30 March, massive U.S. air support was required inside South Vietnam and its air strikes in Laos dropped to their lowest point since 1965.

In northern Laos, the communists made additional gains during the year but failed to overwhelm government forces. In November, the Pathet Lao agreed to meet with Laotian government representatives to discuss a cease-fire.

The war had resulted in a large number of refugees with a peak number of 378,800 internally displaced persons under government control in October 1973.

=== 1973–1974 ===

The U.S. pulled out of Laos in 1973, as stipulated by the Paris Peace Accords. Thailand likewise began to withdraw its troops from Laos following the signing of the Paris Accords. North Vietnam was not required to remove its forces under the terms of the treaty.

The national government was forced to accept the Pathet Lao into the government.
During 1974 and 1975 the balance of power in Laos shifted steadily in favour of the Pathēt Lao as the U.S. disengaged itself from Indochina. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma was tired and demoralised, and following a heart attack in mid-1974 he spent some months recuperating in France, after which he announced that he would retire from politics following the elections scheduled for early 1976.

The anti-communist forces were thus leaderless, and also divided and deeply mired in corruption. Souphanouvong, by contrast, was confident and a master political tactician, and had behind him the disciplined cadres of the communist party and the Pathēt Lao forces and the North Vietnamese army. The end of American aid also meant the mass demobilization of most of the non-Pathēt Lao military forces in the country. The Pathēt Lao on the other hand continued to be both funded and equipped by North Vietnam.

In May 1974 Souphanouvong put forward an 18-point plan for &quot;National Reconstruction&quot;, which was unanimously adopted – a sign of his increasing dominance. The plan was mostly uncontroversial, with renewed promises of free elections, democratic rights and respect for religion, as well as constructive economic policies. But press censorship was introduced in the name of &quot;national unity&quot;, making it more difficult for non-communist forces to organise politically in response to the creeping Pathēt Lao takeover. In January 1975 all public meetings and demonstrations were banned. Recognising the trend of events, influential business and political figures began to move their assets, and in some cases themselves, to Thailand, France or the U.S.

=== Fall of Vientiane ===

In March 1975 the North Vietnamese began their final military offensive in South Vietnam, which by the end of April carried them to victory with the fall of Saigon. Thirteen days earlier the Khmer Rouge army had captured Phnom Penh. The Pathēt Lao now knew that victory was within reach, and with the Vietnam War over the North Vietnamese authorised the seizure of power in Laos. Pathēt Lao forces on the Plain of Jars supported by North Vietnamese heavy artillery and other units began advancing westward.

In late April, the Pathēt Lao took the government outpost at Sala Phou Khoum crossroads which opened up Route 13 to a Pathēt Lao advance toward Muang Kassy. For the non-Pathēt Lao elements in the government, compromise seemed better than allowing what had happened in Cambodia and South Vietnam to happen in Laos. A surrender was thought to be better than a change of power by force.

In the city of Savannakhet, border at Mekong River on opposite side Thailand, several Pathet Laos underground organization members launched smaller uprising revolution against current Laotian right-wing leaders. The small uprising revolution started shortly after the enjoyable Laotian New Year festivity. Around late May 1975, after South Vietnamese government collapsed to VC, Savannakhet residents, as well as college students, joined the political rally to praise the support of new political shift toward Pathet Laos. Most of Royal Laotian troops couldn&#x27;t quelled the main demonstrations. On May 31, 1975, the largely Pathet Laos troops arrived at Savannakhet without bloodshed of battle at the provincial capital. Presumably, some handful of Laotian residents from Savannakhet, as well as right wing political members, fled to Thailand by boat either before or during a swift Pathet Lao takeover. The Pathet Lao soldiers and high-ranking officials marched north to target Vientiane as anti-monarchy protests raged in Vientiane.

Demonstrations broke out in Vientiane, denouncing the rightists and demanding political change. Rightist ministers resigned from the government and fled the country, followed by senior Royal Lao Army commanders. A Pathēt Lao minister took over the defence portfolio, removing any chance of the Army resisting the Pathēt Lao takeover. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma, dreading further conflict and apparently trusting Souphanouvong&#x27;s promises of a moderate policy, gave instructions that the Pathēt Lao were not to be resisted, and the U.S. began to withdraw its diplomatic personnel.

The Pathēt Lao army entered the major towns of southern Laos during May, and in early June occupied Luang Phrabāng. Panic broke out in Vientiane as most of the business class and many officials, officers and others who had collaborated with the U.S. scrambled to get their families and property across the Mekong to Thailand. Recognising that the cause was lost, Vang Pao led thousands of his Hmong fighters and their families into exile – eventually about a third of all the Lao Hmong left the country. Pathēt Lao forces taking over Vientiane in August 23.

For a few months the Pathēt Lao appeared to honour their promises of moderation. The shell of the coalition government was preserved, there were no arrests or show-trials, and private property was respected. Diplomatic relations with the U.S. were maintained, despite an immediate cut-off of all U.S. aid. (Other western countries continued to offer aid, and Soviet and eastern European technicians began to arrive to replace the departed Americans.) Most Western countries, including prominent long-time ally United States, closed their embassies either shortly before or after the rise of the establishment of Laos PDR claimed the new communist authoritarian government hasn&#x27;t implement a new Constitution and the affliction of ideological deterioration.

In September 1975, during an interview, Prime Minister Phouma stated his wish to stay in office until 1976 so he could plan the major steps needed for the long-term reunification process, and to ensure the Pathet Lao did not take away some of the political powers of the monarchy. Phouma hoped that the 1976 election will select a new head of state from the majority faction, assumed to be the Pathet Lao, who will create the new nonprovisional Vientiane government, with the promise of retaining some liberties and potentially be more open diplomatically with non-communist Thailand.

On 2 December, the day after the Pathet Lao-organized National Conference of People&#x27;s Representatives voted to immediate abolition of the monarchy (on 1 December), King Savang Vatthana agreed to abdicate and Souvanna Phouma resigned. The Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic was proclaimed, with Souphanouvong as President. Kaysone Phomvihane emerged from the shadows to become Prime Minister and the real ruler of the country. A few royal family members, including a Prince, crossed the Mekong River and evacuated to Thailand a few days before the establishment of the Laos PDR, fearing societal upheaval and persecution.

By this point, the Pathēt Lao dropped all pretense of moderation, and no more was heard of elections or political freedoms. Non-communist newspapers were closed, and a large-scale purge of the civil service, army and police was launched. Furthermore, the communist Vietnamese government prevented the re-emergence of Laotian Neutralist Party (LNP) and other right-wing political parties and organisations across Laos, blaming them for instigating the chaotic upheaval on behalf of &quot;foreign imperialists&quot; without direct evidence. Thousands were dispatched for &quot;re-education&quot; in remote parts of the country, where many died and many more were kept for up to ten years. The vast majority of the royal family of Laos, including the deposed king, were also sent to the &quot;re-education camps&quot;, where most eventually died from starvation and hard labor during the totalitarian period of the 1980s.

This prompted a renewed flight from the country. &quot;About 90 percent&quot; of Laos&#x27;s &quot;intellectuals, technicians, and officials&quot; left Laos following the communist takeover. Many of the professional and intellectual class, who had initially been willing to work for the new regime, changed their minds and left; a much easier thing to do from Laos than from either Vietnam or Cambodia. In proportional terms, Laos experienced the largest refugee flight of the Indochinese nations, with a full 10% of the population – 300,000 people out of a total of 3 million – crossing the border into Thailand.

Once in power, the Pathet Lao economically cut its ties to all its neighbors (including China) with the exception of reunified Vietnam, and signed a treaty of friendship with Hanoi. The treaty allowed the Vietnamese to station soldiers within Laos and to place advisers throughout the government and economy. This is considered by most historians and journalists to be the end of the Second Indochina War. Consequently, neighboring Thailand banned any export and transit goods to Mekong River at Laos until 1989, when Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan eased the trade restrictions, citing the gradual diplomatic normalization between Thailand and Laos.

== Evacuation of the Hmong ==

A dramatic event during the takeover of Laos by the communists was the evacuation of Vang Pao and other Hmong leaders by air from Long Tieng. The end came for Vang Pao on 5 May 1975 when he was called before Souvanna Phouma, the Prime Minister of Laos, and ordered to cooperate with the communist Pathet Lao. Vang Pao took the general&#x27;s stars off his collar, threw them on the desk of Souvanna Phouma, and stalked out of the room. Four days later the official Pathet Lao newspaper warned that the Hmong people would be exterminated &quot;to the last root.&quot;

Jerry Daniels, Vang Pao&#x27;s CIA case officer, was the only American remaining in Long Tieng and he began to plan an evacuation of the Hmong. However, he had only one airplane to evacuate the 3,500 Hmong leaders and families he judged to be at risk of execution by the Pathet Lao then advancing on Long Tieng. Brigadier General Heinie Aderholt in Bangkok helped to find additional planes and sent three pilots flying two C-46 and one C-130 transport aircraft to Long Tieng. The planes were &quot;&quot; to remove any U.S. markings as the operation was carried out in secret. The pilots were American civilians: Les Strouse, Matt Hoff, and Al Rich.

With the three American planes, the evacuation began in earnest on 13 May with each transport aircraft making four flights each that day from Long Tieng to Udorn, Thailand and transporting more than 65 people per airplane on each trip – far more than the 35 maximum passengers dictated by safety conditions at mountain-ringed Long Tieng. Thousands of Hmong clustered around the airstrip at Long Tieng awaiting evacuation. On 14 May, Vang Pao and Jerry Daniels were evacuated secretly by helicopter to Thailand and the air evacuation came to an end. The next day the Pathet Lao marched into Long Tieng unopposed. Daniels accompanied Vang Pao to exile in Montana and then returned to Thailand to help the Hmong refugees there.

What nobody had anticipated was how tens of thousands of Hmong, left behind in Long Tieng and Laos, would follow Vang Pao and other Hmong leaders to Thailand. By the end of 1975, about 40,000 Hmong had succeeded to reaching Thailand, traveling on foot through the mountains and floating across the Mekong River. How many died or were killed in their attempt to escape Laos is not known, but the flight of Hmong and other Laotian highland peoples into Thailand would continue for many more years. They faced repression at home from the communist government for their collaboration with the Americans. Most of the Hmong in Thailand would eventually be resettled in the United States and other countries. Between 1975 and 1982, 53,700 Hmong and other highland Laotian refugees were resettled in the United States and thousands more in other countries.

== Aftermath ==

Due to the Vietnam War, the Laotian War has been almost forgotten by the majority of people around the world, even in the United States and Vietnam.

According to the Vietnamese government, from 1994 to 2012, the remains of 14,549 North Vietnamese soldiers, who were killed during the war, were found in Laos.

=== Unexploded bombs ===
The U.S. dropped 2,756,941 tons of ordnance on 113,716 Laotian sites in 230,516 sorties between 1965 and 1973 alone, making Laos the most heavily bombed country in history relative to the size of its population; &quot;The New York Times&quot; notes this was &quot;nearly a ton for every person in Laos&quot;. By September 1969, the Plain of Jars was largely deserted.
U.S. aircraft dropped more ordnance on Laos than on all countries during World War II, leaving Laos with about 78 million pieces of unexploded ordnance (UXO) by the end of the war. Casualties continue to mount from UXO dropped by the U.S. and Laotian Air Forces from 1964 to 1973. It has been reported that, between 1964 and 1973, areas controlled by the invading North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao were hit by an average of one B‑52 bomb-load every eight minutes, 24 hours a day. Xiangkhouang Province was the most heavily bombed province. Thirty per cent of bombs failed to explode immediately.

UXO remains dangerous to persons coming in contact, purposefully or accidentally, with bombs. According to a Laotian government survey, casualties from explosive ordnance during the civil war period, between 1964 and 1975, are estimated at 30,000, while casualties since the end of the war from UXO are estimated at 20,000. They estimate 50,000 casualties from explosive ordnance in total, including 29,522 killed and 21,048 injured. Explosive remnants of war (ERW) caused most of the casualties, followed by landmines, and then cluster munitions which caused 15% of casualties. 59 people were known to have been killed or injured by UXO in 2006. So abundant are the remnants of bombs on the Plain of Jars that the collection and sale of scrap metal from bombs has been a major industry since the Civil War. Currently 50 people are killed or maimed every year from UXO.

Due to the particularly heavy impact of cluster bombs during this war, Laos was a strong advocate of the Convention on Cluster Munitions to ban the weapons and was host to the First Meeting of States Parties to the convention in November 2010.

=== Plight of Hmong and other U.S.-allied veterans ===

Many former ethnic Hmong and Laotian veterans and their families, led by Colonel Wangyee Vang of the Lao Veterans of America Institute and Lao Veterans of America, worked to establish a non-profit organization and advocate for honorary U.S. citizenship for the Secret Army veterans. In 2000, the Hmong Veterans&#x27; Naturalization Act of 2000 was passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by US President Bill Clinton.

Many of the Hmong people came down from the mountains and surrendered to the Lao government, while others found their way to refugee camps in Thailand. In 2008, however, a repatriation agreement between the Thai and Lao governments resulted in a mass forced deportation of the people in these camps, and reports of atrocities committed against them by the Lao military spurred activist groups to try to persuade the Thai government to keep granting asylum to the refugees, but to no avail.

In 2004, following several years of pressure from a coalition of U.S. human rights activists, the U.S. government reversed its policy of denying immigration to Hmong who had fled Laos in the 1990s for refugee camps in Thailand. In a major victory for the Hmong, the U.S. government recognized some 15,000 Hmong as political refugees and afforded them expedited U.S. immigration rights.

=== Memorial in the US ===
Twenty-two years following the end of the Laotian War, on 15 May 1997, the U.S. officially acknowledged its role in the Secret War. A memorial to American and Hmong contributions to U.S. air and ground combat efforts during the conflict was established by the Lao Veterans of America, the Center for Public Policy Analysis, in cooperation with the U.S. Congress and others. The Laos Memorial is located on the grounds of the Arlington National Cemetery between the John F. Kennedy Eternal Flame and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

<doc id="209825" wikidata="Q618619" url="?curid=209825" title="Apical dominance">
<text>In botany, apical dominance is the phenomenon whereby the main, central stem of the plant is dominant over (i.e., grows more strongly than) other side stems; on a branch the main stem of the branch is further dominant over its own side twigs.

Plant physiology describes apical dominance as the control exerted by the terminal bud (and shoot apex) over the outgrowth of lateral buds.

==Overview==
Apical dominance occurs when the shoot apex inhibits the growth of lateral buds so that the plant may grow vertically. It is important for the plant to devote energy to growing upward so that it can get more light to undergo photosynthesis. If the plant utilizes available energy for growing upward, it may be able to outcompete other individuals in the vicinity. Plants that were capable of outcompeting neighboring plants likely had higher fitness. Apical dominance is therefore most likely adaptive.

Typically, the end of a shoot contains an apical bud, which is the location where shoot growth occurs. The apical bud produces a plant hormone, auxin (IAA), that inhibits growth of the lateral buds further down on the stem towards the axillary bud. Auxin is predominantly produced in the growing shoot apex and is transported throughout the plant via the phloem and diffuses into lateral buds which prevents elongation. That auxin likely regulates apical dominance was first discovered in 1934.

When the apical bud is removed, the lowered IAA concentration allows the lateral buds to grow and produce new shoots, which compete to become the lead growth.

==Apex removal==
Plant physiologists have identified four different stages the plant goes through after the apex is removed (Stages I-IV). The four stages are referred to as 
# lateral bud formation, 
# &quot;imposition of inhibition&quot; (apical dominance), 
# initiation of lateral bud outgrowth following decapitation, and 
# elongation and development of the lateral bud into a branch. 

These stages can also be defined by the hormones that are regulating the process which are as follows: Stage I, cytokinin promoted, causing the lateral bud to form since cytokinin plays a role in cell division; Stage II, auxin is promoted, resulting in apical dominance (&quot;imposition of inhibition&quot;); Stage III, cytokinin released resulting in outward growth of the lateral bud; and Stage IV, auxin is decreased and gibberellic acid is promoted which results in cell division, enabling the bud or branch to continue outward growth.

More simply stated, lateral bud formation is inhibited by the shoot apical meristem (SAM). The lateral bud primordium (from which the lateral bud develops) is located below SAM. The shoot tip rising from the SAM inhibits the growth of the lateral bud by repressing auxin. When the shoot is cut off, the lateral bud begins to lengthen which is mediated by a release of cytokinin. Once the apical dominance has been lifted from the plant, elongation and lateral growth is promoted and the lateral buds grow into new branches. When lateral bud formation prevents the plant from growing upward, it is undergoing lateral dominance. Often, lateral dominance can be triggered by decapitating the SAM or artificially decreasing the concentration of auxin in plant tissues.

== Applications ==

When the apical bud is removed, the lowered IAA concentration allows the lateral buds to grow and produce new shoots, which compete to become the lead growth. Pruning techniques such as coppicing and pollarding make use of this natural response to curtail direct plant growth and produce a desired shape, size, and/or productivity level for the plant. The principle of apical dominance is manipulated for espalier creation, hedge building, or artistic sculptures called topiary. If the SAM is removed, it stimulates growth in the lateral direction. By careful pruning, it is possible to create remarkable designs or patterns.

Some fruit trees have strong apical dominance, and young trees can become &quot;leggy&quot;, with poor side limb development. Apical dominance can be reduced in this case, or in cases where limbs are broken off by accident, by cutting off the auxin flow above side buds that one wishes to stimulate. This is often done by orchardists for young trees.

Occasionally, strong apical dominance is advantageous, as in the &quot;Ballerina&quot; apple trees. These trees are intended to be grown in small gardens, and their strong apical dominance combined with a dwarfing rootstock gives a compact narrow tree with very short fruiting side branches.

<text>Jacques Marie Eugène Godefroy Cavaignac (May 21, 1853 – September 25, 1905), known as Godefroy Cavaignac, was a French politician.

==Early life==
Born in Paris, he was the son of Louis Eugène Cavaignac. He made public profession of his republican principles as a schoolboy at the Lycée Charlemagne by refusing in 1867 to receive a prize at the Sorbonne from the hand of the Prince Imperial.

==Third Republic==

He received the military medal for service in the Franco-Prussian War and in 1872 entered the École Polytechnique. He served as a civil engineer in Angoulême until 1881, when he became master of requests in the Council of State.

The next year, he was elected as a republican deputy for the &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Saint-Calais (Sarthe). In 1885–1886, he was undersecretary for war in the Henri Brisson ministry, and he served in the cabinet of Émile Loubet (1892) as Minister of Marine and of the Colonies. He had exchanged his moderate republicanism for radical views before he became War Minister in the cabinet of Léon Bourgeois (November 1, 1895 to April 29, 1896).

He was again Minister of War in the Brisson cabinet from June 28 to September 5, 1898. In July 1898, he told the French National Assembly of documents incriminating Captain Alfred Dreyfus. Cavaignac&#x27;s investigator, Captain Louis Cuignet, later discovered that the critical document was a forgery by Colonel Henry, who admitted his crime when he was questioned on August 30 by Cavaignac. Still, Cavaignac refused to concur with his colleagues in a revision of the Dreyfus prosecution, which would have been the logical outcome of his own exposure of the forgery. Resigning his portfolio, he continued to declare his conviction of Dreyfus&#x27;s guilt and joined the nationalist group in the chamber of which he became one of its leaders. (He is portrayed in precisely the opposite way in the 1937 film &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot; in which he is depicted as the person who finally discovers the truth and demands the resignation of all those responsible for incriminating Dreyfus.) He also was an energetic supporter of the Ligue de la Patrie Française.

In 1899, Cavaignac was an unsuccessful candidate for French President.

==Death==
He had announced his intention of retiring from political life when he died at his country home near Flée (Sarthe) on September 25, 1905, aged 52.

==Works==
He wrote an important book on the &quot;Formation de la Prusse contemporaine&quot; (2 vols., 1891–1898), dealing with the events of 1806–1813.

<doc id="209827" wikidata="Q215790" url="?curid=209827" title="Americal Division">
<text>The Americal Division was an infantry division of the United States Army during World War II, briefly in the mid 1950s and the Vietnam War.

The division was activated 27 May 1942 on the island of New Caledonia. In the immediate emergency following Pearl Harbor, the United States had hurriedly sent a task force to defend New Caledonia against a feared Japanese attack. This division was the only division formed outside of United States territory during World War II (a distinction it would repeat when reformed during the Vietnam War). At the suggestion of a subordinate, the division&#x27;s commander, Major General Alexander Patch, requested that the new unit be known as the &quot;Americal Division&quot;—the name being a contraction of &quot;American, New Caledonian Division&quot;. This was unusual, as with the exception of the Philippine Division, all other U.S. divisions were known by a number. After World War II the Americal Division was officially re-designated as the 23rd Infantry Division. However, it was rarely referred to as such, even on official orders.

During the Vietnam War the division had a mixed record. It combined participation in numerous battles and campaigns but was marred by the My Lai massacre, which was committed by a platoon of the division&#x27;s subordinate 11th Infantry Brigade, led by Lieutenant William Calley.

The division suffered a tactical defeat in the early morning of 28 March 1971, when Vietcong sappers assaulted FSB Mary Ann. The attack destroyed key infrastructure, as well as killing 33 and wounding 83 Americans.

The division was inactivated following its withdrawal from South Vietnam in November 1971.

==Operations in World War II==
The 164th Infantry Regiment of the Americal Division went into action on Guadalcanal on 13 October 1942 alongside the 1st Marine Division as the first United States Army unit to conduct an offensive operation against the enemy in either the Pacific or European Theater of Operations during World War II. Eight other U.S. Army divisions began offensive combat operations in late 1942: the 32nd and the 41st Infantry Divisions in the Pacific on New Guinea; and in North Africa, the 1st, 3rd, 9th, and 34th Infantry Divisions, and the 1st and 2nd Armored Divisions.
===Formation===
As the &quot;square&quot; divisions of the National Guard were being transitioned to the triangular division TO&amp;E in 1942, they each &quot;shed&quot; an infantry regiment, leaving several trained and operational &quot;orphan&quot; regiments available for independent service.

The &quot;line&quot; regiments selected to form the Americal Division were the 132nd Infantry Regiment from Illinois, formerly part of the 33rd Infantry Division, the 164th Infantry Regiment from North Dakota, formerly part of the 34th Infantry Division, and the 182nd Infantry Regiment from Massachusetts, formerly part of the 26th Infantry Division.

===New Caledonia===
New Caledonia, a likely target for the Japanese for its critical strategic position on the lines of communication with New Zealand and Australia and its nickel and chromium mines, was now under the control of the Free French with a poorly equipped and trained native force and a company of Australian commandos.

The United States Army was already building airfields with Australian labor on the island which according to early agreements fell into the British sphere and delegated to the Australians for defense. The French objected to the arrangement and, increasingly worried about Japanese invasion being attracted by the airfield, demanded additional American forces.

With pressing needs to build up defenses in Hawaii and Australia, Army planners decided to put together a force rather than commit an already organized division. The regiments available through the reorganization of divisions along with other elements made available a force of about 15,000 men. This force, designated Task Force 6814 and often mentioned as Poppy Force (New Caledonia was code named Poppy), under Brigadier General Alexander M. Patch, Jr. had the elements of a division and more in its composition. For example, there was a brigade headquarters from the 26th Division, two infantry regiments and a field artillery regiment along with support elements augmented by a battalion of light tanks, antiaircraft and coast artillery regiments and a pursuit squadron. The force&#x27;s mission was to hold New Caledonia. It was an independent command, directly under the War Department in Washington.

Within two weeks, despite an urgent need of shipping elsewhere and at the cost of delaying and rearranging schedules elsewhere and consultations at the head of state level, Task Force 6814 along with some 4,000 troops destined for Australia were assembled in the largest single troop convoy up until that time, designated BT-200 and totaling over 20,000 troops aboard seven transports. The convoy sailed from the New York Port of Embarkation on 23 January 1942 and reached Melbourne on 26 February.

This large and critical convoy was covered by a striking group and long range air between its intended position and Japanese forces arranged by Admiral King (COMINCH) with Admiral Nimitz (CINCPAC). Despite some desire locally to use the force to reinforce Australia or the Netherlands East Indies, under direct orders from Washington the force moved secretly, not even informing the French, to New Caledonia.

Transshipment of troops and equipment was completed in Melbourne and the seven transports departed on 7 March (Australian time) for New Caledonia as convoy ZK-7, arriving six days later. General Patch, preceding the force by air, had arrived on 5 March with news for the French that American forces were underway. Despite having no early prospect of reinforcements, another infantry regiment arrived in April, along with the authority to organize an infantry division from elements of the overall force and, in May, the Americal Division was organized.

On 14 March 1942, two days after the task force later to be known as the Americal Division landed in Nouméa, New Caledonia, the 182nd Infantry was detailed to provide a special unit to be called Force A for advance occupation and outposting of the New Hebrides, a group of islands lying directly astride the supply route to the United States. Assigned to this duty were Companies L and M and attached elements from Headquarters Company, Service Company, and the Medical Detachment, plus a platoon of the 101st Engineers.

The total of around 480 men was under the command of Brigadier General Rose. That a brigadier general should be placed in command of two infantry rifle companies indicated the degree of importance and hazard that G.H.Q. placed upon the mission, but mainly it was so that Rose had authority to deal directly with the highest local French authorities.

The men were assembled and told that Force A and 50 Australians held the most advanced outpost of the Allied Forces in the South Pacific along with Australian forces at Port Moresby, Papua. No retreat was possible, no reinforcements could be relied on. Supply was unreliable and limited.

On 28 March 1942, a unit of Force A left an isolated coconut plantation called Euralia for Port Havanah with two 2nd lieutenants and 22 men on a small auxiliary sailboat with equipment and 10 days&#x27; rations to begin their &#x27;guerrilla&#x27; action by gathering the native headhunters and plantation workers from the nearby islands as reinforcements.

===Guadalcanal===

In contrast to several other US Army divisions in the Pacific War, soldiers in the Americal Division received extensive weapons training as well as company- and battalion-level exercises in jungle terrain while at New Caledonia. Under the command of General Patch, the Americal Division was the first US Army unit to be sent to Guadalcanal. Largely because of transport constraints, the Americal arrived piecemeal and was fed into combat alongside the battle-hardened and exhausted US 1st Marine Division, which it eventually relieved. Its soldiers were quick to assimilate from the Marines on Guadalcanal lessons on battle tactics against Japanese forces. Americal casualties were consequently less than what might be expected.

The 164th Infantry Regiment landed on Guadalcanal on 13 October 1942 ahead of its brother regiments, as emergency reinforcement for the 1st Marine Division. The regiment was the first U.S. Army unit to engage in offensive action during World War II as part of the Battle of Guadalcanal. Between 24 and 27 October, elements of the regiment withstood repeated assaults from Japanese battalions and inflicted some two thousand enemy casualties; the 164th also supported and participated in Marine attacks. The First Marine Division&#x27;s commander, Major General A. A. Vandegrift, was so impressed by the soldiers&#x27; stand that he issued a unit commendation to the regiment for having demonstrated &quot;an overwhelming superiority over the enemy.&quot; In addition, General Vandegrift took the unusual step of awarding Lieutenant Colonel Robert Hall, commander of the 3rd Battalion, 164th, with the Navy Cross for his role in these battles. The 164th was then occasionally referred to as the &#x27;164th Marines&#x27; due to their special relationship with the Marines on Guadalcanal.

In November the 164th took part in the offensive across the Matanikau River. Other elements of the division arrived piecemeal in the last few weeks of 1942.

In January 1943, the 132nd Infantry Regiment of the division took Hill 27 and 31 of the Mount Austen complex. The division later participated in offensives to sweep Guadalcanal of remaining Japanese resistance. After the last Japanese defenders were killed, captured, or evacuated from the island, the division was relieved on 9 February 1943.

Despite its ad hoc formation, the Americal Division fought well at Guadalcanal. The 164th Regiment took part in repulsing a major Japanese offensive in October 1942, while the 132nd Regiment, along with the 25th Infantry Division assaulted the highly fortified Japanese Gifu defensive complex at Mount Austen in January 1943. Historians describe the Americal Division as the most effective of all the US Army divisions in that campaign. Following the withdrawal of the 1st Marine Division, the division continued operations on Guadalcanal as part of the U.S. XIV Corps with the 25th Infantry Division (who later earned their &#x27;Tropic Lightning&#x27; nickname here) and the 2nd Marine Division (Arrived earlier as reinforcements to the 1st MarDiv) until all of the Japanese resistance had ended.

===Bougainville===


The division next moved to the Fiji Islands, beginning 5 March 1943, to assume the defense of the main island of Viti Levu and to engage in extensive training.

During the period 25 December 1943 to 12 January 1944 the Americal Division landed on Bougainville, relieving the 3rd Marine Division. They were given the task (alongside the 37th Infantry Division and a Marine defense battalion) of holding and extending the right half of a previously established perimeter.

Warned by intelligence, they met a massive and sustained Japanese counter-attack, which began on 7 March 1944. Despite ample warning and thorough defensive preparations, the battle soon degenerated into a bitter, close-quarters infantry affair, with artillery restricted by the need to avoid friendly troops and tanks unable to reach the scene. The 37th and Americal Divisions stood firm, and by 25 March, the Japanese were forced to retreat. It was the last Japanese ground offensive in the South Pacific.

The division went on the offensive in March 1944, driving the Japanese east of Mananga River, 7–9 April 1944, and seizing numerous strategic hill bases during the remainder of the month. Training and long-range patrol activity continued until 30 November 1944 when the division was relieved.

===Philippines===

On 8 January 1945, the division began movement to Leyte and Samar, to take part in cleaning out remaining Japanese forces on those islands, and to invade Biri, Capul, Ticao, and Burias. On Leyte, the division was relieved on 13 March 1945 and then landed on Cebu on 26 March, and seized the city and airfield by 28 March. Divisional combat teams made landings on Bohol, Negros, and Mindanao, where they cleared out pockets of resisting Japanese until 17 June when ordered to return to Cebu, arriving on 25 June. The Americal Division added by the newly local Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary and the recognized guerrillas for the liberated in Visayas and Mindanao against the Japanese.

Training continued on Cebu for the proposed invasion of Japan, but the Japanese surrendered on 14 August 1945. On 10 September 1945, the Americal Division landed in Japan and took part in the occupation of the Yokohama–Kawasaki–Yokosuka area.

===Casualties===
* Total battle casualties: 4,050
* Killed in action: 981
* Wounded in action: 3,052
* Missing in action: 16
* Prisoner of war: 1

==Postwar==
The division returned to the United States on 21 November 1945, and was inactivated on 12 December 1945 at Fort Lewis, Washington State.

It was reactivated on 1 December 1954 as the 23rd Infantry Division, retaining the name &quot;Americal&quot; as part of its official designation. On 2 December 1954 the 65th Infantry Regiment was assigned to the division. The 23rd Division encompassed geographically-separated units in the Caribbean region. On 10 April 1956, the 65th Infantry Regiment was inactivated at Camp Losey, Puerto Rico, and relieved from assignment to the 23d, which itself was inactivated.

The division served in the Panama Canal Zone until 10 April 1956, when it was again inactivated.

==Vietnam==


The division was reactivated 25 September 1967 at Chu Lai in Vietnam from a combination of units already in Vietnam and newly arrived units. Its precursor, a division-sized task force known as Task Force Oregon was created in Quảng Ngãi and Quảng Tín provinces from the 3rd Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division, the 1st Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division, and the 196th Light Infantry Brigade (all brigades that deployed separately to Vietnam in 1966). Task Force Oregon operated in close cooperation with the 1st Marine Division in the I Corps Military Region. As more US Army units arrived in Vietnam the two divisional brigades were released back to their parent organizations and two arriving separate brigades were assigned to Task Force Oregon, which was in turn re-designated the 23rd Infantry Division (Americal). The division was composed of the 11th, 196th, and 198th Light Infantry Brigades and divisional support units. Both the 11th and 198th brigades were newly formed units.

The division suffered an important defeat at the Battle of Kham Duc but gave a solid performance during the Tet Offensive, the Battle of Lo Giang and the Battle of Landing Zone Center/Hill 352. Platoon Sergeant Finnis McCleery was awarded the Medal of Honor for his valiant efforts on Hill 352. Sgt. Alan Allen was awarded the Silver Star for this same battle. Both men were members of A Co. 1/6 198th. 20 men from A Company were lost in the Battle of Lo Giang on 8 February 1968. A Co. of the 198th was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its heroic efforts in the Battle of Lo Giang, 8 February 1968.

The division became notorious after its 1st Platoon, Company C, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry (11th Infantry Brigade) led by Lieutenant William Calley slaughtered hundreds of South Vietnamese civilians in the My Lai Massacre in March 1968. A helicopter crew from the division&#x27;s 123rd Aviation Battalion, led by Hugh Thompson, Jr., attempted to intervene in the massacre and were later awarded the Soldier&#x27;s Medal. Seymour Hersh broke the story of the massacre in November 1969, and a year later 14 officers – including Samuel W. Koster, the division&#x27;s commanding officer – were charged with covering the massacre up. Most of the charges were later dropped, but Koster was subsequently demoted and stripped of his Distinguished Service Medal. Calley was charged, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment and hard labor on 31 March 1971 for the murder of 22 Vietnamese civilians. President Richard Nixon soon intervened and on 1 April 1971 ordered Calley transferred from Fort Leavenworth to house arrest at Fort Benning, pending his appeal. Calley, the only person convicted, eventually served only three and half years of house arrest and was released in September 1974.

Brigadier General John W. Donaldson was later tried for shooting civilians from helicopters on 13 separate incidents. Donaldson was the highest-ranking officer to undergo court-martial during the war, but charges were eventually dropped due to lack of evidence. These allegations were raised by helicopter pilots under his command, and senior military investigators alleged that senior commanders of the division including Donaldson had routinely &quot;...bet in the morning how many people they could kill – old people, civilians, it didn&#x27;t matter&quot;, but the investigation was closed due to a lack of evidence. 

On 28 March 1971, Vietcong sappers attacked Firebase Mary Ann, which was being transferred by the 1st Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment to the ARVN, resulting in 33 US/ARVN killed.

The 198th and 11th Brigades were withdrawn from Vietnam in November 1971, and the division was inactivated. The 196th Brigade was reconstituted as a separate brigade and remained in Vietnam until 29 June 1972, the last major combat unit to be withdrawn. Its 3rd Battalion, 21st infantry (Gimlets) was the last U.S. maneuver battalion to leave Vietnam, on 23 August 1972.

==Insignia==
The shoulder sleeve insignia was originally approved for the Americal Division on 20 December 1943. It was redesignated for the 23d Infantry Division on 4 November 1954. On 14 December 1967 the distinctive unit insignia was approved.

The shoulder sleeve insignia&#x27;s four white stars on a blue field are symbolic of the Southern Cross under which the organization has served. The blue color stands for infantry.

On the distinctive unit insignia, the blue saltire (cross of St. Andrew) alludes to New Caledonia in the Southwest Pacific where the division was created and first activated on 27 May 1942. Each of the four white stars stands for the Southern Cross constellation on its division insignia, as well as the four World War II campaigns (Guadalcanal, Northern Solomons, Leyte and Southern Philippines) in which the division participated. The anchor refers to the Presidential Unit Citation (Navy) awarded the division for Guadalcanal. The red arrowhead and Philippine sun stand for the assault landing, Southern Philippines, and the award of the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation (7 October 1944 to 4 July 1945). The unsheathed sword with point to top refers to Vietnam where the division was active. In view of the division&#x27;s origin and outstanding service in World War II and inasmuch as it was one of the few U.S. Army divisions to bear a name instead of a number, the division&#x27;s former name &quot;Americal&quot; has been taken as a motto, the association with that name being both inspirational and of historical military significance.

<text>Air America was an American passenger and cargo airline established in 1946 and covertly owned and operated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from 1950 to 1976. It supplied and supported covert operations in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, including allegedly providing support for drug smuggling in Laos.

==Early history: Civil Air Transport (CAT)==
CAT was created by Claire Chennault and Whiting Willauer in 1946 as Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) Air Transport to airlift supplies and food into war-ravaged China. It was soon pressed into service to support Chiang Kai-shek and his Kuomintang forces in the civil war between them and the communists under Mao Zedong. Many of its first pilots were veterans of Chennault&#x27;s World War II combat groups, popularly known as Flying Tigers. By 1950, following the defeat of Chiang&#x27;s forces and their retreat to Taiwan, the airline faced financial difficulties. In August 1950, the CIA bought out Chennault and Willauer, continuing to operate as CAT, until 1959, when it changed its name to Air America.

Air America&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Anything, Anywhere, Anytime, Professionally&quot;. Air America aircraft, including the Curtiss C-46 Commando, Pilatus PC-6 Porter, de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou, Lockheed C-130 Hercules, and Fairchild C-123 Provider, along with UH-34D, Bell 204B, Bell 205, and Boeing CH-47C Chinook helicopters, flew many types of cargo to countries such as the Republic of Vietnam, the Kingdom of Laos, and Cambodia. It operated from bases in those countries and also from bases in Thailand and as far afield as Taiwan and Japan. It also on occasion flew top-secret missions into Burma and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== Operations during the Vietnam War ==
From 1959 to 1962 the airline provided direct and indirect support to US Special Forces &quot;Ambidextrous&quot;, &quot;Hotfoot&quot;, and &quot;White Star&quot;, which trained the regular Royal Laotian armed forces. After 1962 a similar operation known as &quot;Project 404&quot; fielded numerous US Army attachés (ARMA) and air attachés (AIRA) to the US embassy in Vientiane.

From 1962 to 1975, Air America inserted and extracted US personnel, provided logistical support to the Royal Lao Army, the Hmong Army under command of Royal Lao Army Major General Vang Pao and combatant Thai volunteer forces, transported refugees, and flew photo reconnaissance missions that provided intelligence on Viet Cong activities. Its operations were some of the first launched by the U.S. as it became increasingly involved militarily in Southeast Asia. Its civilian-marked craft were frequently used, under the control of the Seventh/Thirteenth Air Force, to launch search and rescue missions for US pilots downed throughout Southeast Asia. Air America pilots were the only known private US corporate employees to operate non-Federal Aviation Administration-certified military aircraft in a combat role. Dan Kurtz, originally from Michigan, now living in Tennessee, masterminded the civilian masquerade of commercial pilots that in reality were covert CIA operatives flying rescue and supply missions in the late &#x27;60s.

By mid-1970, the airline had two dozen twin-engine transport aircraft as well as Boeing 727 and Boeing 747 jets plus two dozen fixed wing short-take off-and-landing aircraft in addition to 30 helicopters dedicated to operations in Burma, Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos. There were more than 300 pilots, copilots, flight mechanics, and airfreight specialists based in Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand. During 1970, Air America delivered 46 million pounds (21,000 metric tons) of food in Laos. Helicopter flight time reached more than 4,000 hours a month in the same year.

Air America flew civilians, diplomats, spies, refugees, commandos, sabotage teams, doctors, war casualties, drug enforcement officers, and even visiting VIPs like Richard Nixon all over Southeast Asia. Part of the CIA&#x27;s support operations in Laos involved logistical support for Hmong militia fighting the North Vietnamese forces and their Pathet Lao allies. Thousands of tons of food were delivered via Air America routes, including live chickens, pigs, water buffalo, and cattle. On top of the food drops (known as &quot;rice drops&quot;) came the logistical demands for the war itself, and Air America pilots flew thousands of flights transporting and air-dropping ammunition and weapons (referred to as &quot;hard rice&quot;) to friendly forces.

When the North Vietnamese Army overran South Vietnam in 1975, Air America helicopters participated in Operation Frequent Wind evacuating both US civilians and South Vietnamese people associated with the Saigon regime. The famous photograph depicting the final evacuation, by Dutch photographer Hubert van Es, was an Air America helicopter taking people from an apartment building at 22 Gia Long Street used by USAID and CIA employees.

=== Allegations of drug trafficking ===

Air America planes sometimes transported drugs during the Laotian Civil War, though there is debate about whether Air America and the CIA were actively involved or merely allowed others to transport drugs. During the war, the CIA recruited people from Meo (Hmong) population to fight the Pathet Lao rebels and their North Vietnamese allies. Because of the conflict, many Hmong depended upon poppy cultivation for money. According to Alfred W. McCoy, because the Plain of Jars had been captured by the Pathet Lao in 1964, the Laotian Air Force was no longer able to land C-47 transport aircraft on the Plain of Jars, which McCoy says transported opium. According to McCoy, as the Laotian Air Force had few light planes that could land on the dirt runways near the mountaintop poppy fields, Air America used as it was the only airline available in northern Laos. McCoy writes that &quot;Air America began flying opium from mountain villages north and east of the Plain of Jars to Gen Vang Pao&#x27;s headquarters at Long Tieng.&quot;
Air America were alleged to have profited from transporting opium and heroin on behalf of Hmong leader Vang Pao, or of &quot;turning a blind eye&quot; to the Laotian military doing it. This allegation has been supported by former Laos CIA paramilitary Anthony Poshepny (aka Tony Poe), former Air America pilots, and other people involved in the war. It is portrayed in the movie &quot;Air America&quot;. However, University of Georgia aviation historian William M. Leary writes that Air America was not involved in the drug trade, citing Joseph Westermeyer, a physician and public health worker resident in Laos from 1965 to 1975, that &quot;American-owned airlines never knowingly transported opium in or out of Laos, nor did their American pilots ever profit from its transport.&quot; Aviation historian Curtis Peebles also denies that Air America employees were involved in opium transportation.

Historian Alfred W. McCoy stated that:
== After the war ==
After it pulled out of South Vietnam in 1975, there was an attempt to keep a company presence in Thailand. After this fell through, Air America was dissolved on June 30, 1976. Air Asia, the company that held all of the Air America assets, was later purchased by Evergreen International Airlines. All proceeds, a sum between 20 and 25 million dollars, were returned to the US Treasury. The employees were released unceremoniously with no accolades and no benefits even for those who suffered long-term disabilities, nor death benefits for families of employees killed in action.

Such benefits as were afforded came from worker&#x27;s compensation insurance required by contracts with the US Air Force that few knew about. The benefits were not awarded easily. Many disabled pilots were ultimately compensated under the federal Longshoremen&#x27;s Act after lengthy battles with CIA bureaucrats who denied their connection to the airline for years. Many died of their injuries before they could be compensated adequately. Accident reports were said to have been falsified, redacted, and stonewalled by CIA officials who continued to deny any relationship to the events described in them.

Air America pilots have attempted to have their federal pensions enhanced.

== Fleet ==
During its existence Air America operated a diverse fleet of aircraft, the majority of which were STOL capable. There was &quot;fluidity&quot; of aircraft between some companies such as Air America, Boun Oum Airways, Continental Air Services, Inc, and the United States Air Force. It was not uncommon for USAF and United States Army Aviation units to lend aircraft to Air America for specific missions. Air America tended to register its aircraft in Taiwan. They operated in Laos without the B- nationality prefix. US military aircraft were often used with the &quot;last three&quot; digits of the military serial as a civil marking. The first two transports of Air America arrived in Vientiane, Laos, on August 23, 1959. The Air America operations at Udorn, Thailand, were closed down on June 30, 1974. Air America&#x27;s operating authority was cancelled by the CAB on January 31, 1974.

== Air Asia ==

Air Asia was a wholly owned subsidiary of Air America which provided technical, management, and equipment services for Civil Air Transport of Formosa. Air Asia was headquartered in Taipei and its main facilities were in Tainan, Taiwan. It is now located in the Tainan Airport. It is the only surviving member of the Pacific Corporation, but currently it is owned by Taiwan Aerospace Corporation and is no longer related to the Central Intelligence Agency.

== 1980s revival of name ==
In the 1980s, Los Angeles–based Total Air, a passenger airline, revived the Air America name. This version of Air America operated Lockheed L-1011 TriStar wide body jetliners with scheduled passenger flights serving Baltimore (BWI), Detroit (DTW), Honolulu (HNL), London (LGW) and Los Angeles (LAX).

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On May 5, 1954, a CAT C-119 crashed in Laos after being hit by ground fire. Pilot James B. McGovern Jr. and Wallace Buford were killed. [McGovern&#x27;s remains were identified in September 2006].
* On September 5, 1963, a C-46 aircraft was hit by ground fire and crashed about two kilometers from Tchepone in the Savannakhet Province. American Eugene DeBruin, Chinese Y. C. To, and the three Thai nationals, Pisidhi Indradat, Prasit Promsuwan, and Prasit Thanee parachuted to safety, but were immediately captured by the Pathet Lao. Joseph C. Cheney and Charles Herrick were killed in the crash. DeBruin, To, Promsuwan, and Thanee are still missing in action. Pisidhi Indradat was later rescued in January 1967.
*On August 20, 1965, a UH-34 crashed and sank into the Mekong River. The three crew members, Pilot Bobby Nunez, deadheading pilot Calhoun and Flight Mechanic Steve Nichols, managed to escape while the four passengers drowned. [CIA Agents Edward Johnson and Louis O&#x27;Jibway, intelligence officers assigned to Air America, were killed] Surnames are only mentioned on the manifest for both crew and passengers. The deadheading pilot, Mr. Calhoun, was involved in a hull loss of another UH-34 earlier that day when the helicopter performed a ground loop.
* On September 27, 1965, a C-45 N9574Z was shot down by small arms fire as it attempted to land near Bao Trai Airstrip, Hau Nghia Province, Vietnam. Pilot John John Lerdo Oyer, and Jack Jack J Wells were killed in the crash.
* On October 12, 1965, a UH-34 H-32 581444 Crashed on take-off from a pad at coordinates XC 675465 near Saravane Laos (L-44) in MR 4 and hit the ground at 90 mph, killing the pilot, Capt. Richard H. Liebert, the co-pilot, Franklin D. Smith, and 2 USAID passengers, including Mike Deuel and Michael A. Maloney. The helicopter had dropped off a payroll at a site east of Se Kong and apparently had engine problems during take-off
* On January 12, 1968 an Air America Bell UH-1D helicopter piloted by Ted Moore, with Glen Woods as &quot;kicker&quot;, shot down an An-2s biplane (&quot;An Air Combat First&quot;) during the Battle of Lima Site 85.
* On January 16, 1969, a Douglas C-47A &quot;949&quot; crashed in the Hai Van Pass, south of Huế, South Vietnam. The aircraft was on a domestic cargo flight from Phu Bai International Airport to Da Nang International Airport. All 12 passengers and crew were killed.
* On February 22, 1970 a H34 Helicopter had just finished delivering supplies to Meo forces defending Xieng Khousang airfield, Vientlane Laos, when it was fired upon by sniper fire; Pilot R. C. Maerkl of Ft Worth Texas was killed; co-pilot John Ford took control of helicopter and landed at a US Government airstrip.
* On December 27, 1971 a C-123K from Udorn Airfield, Kingdom of Thailand, headed for Xienhom District, Xaignabouli Province, Laos. The aircraft was on a routine resupply mission for U.S. Agency for International Development and was last heard from when they were northeast of Sayaboury. Laos. The plane and four crewmen were missing. On September 25, 2018 the remains of pilot George L. Ritter; co-pilot Roy F. Townley and crewman Edward J. Weissenback were accounted for.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Cavaignac (10 January 1763 – 24 March 1829) was a French politician and statesman.

==Biography==
Born at Gourdon (Lot &quot;département&quot;), he was, after the outbreak of the French Revolution, a member of the &quot;département&quot;&#x27;s directory and then elected its deputy to the National Convention, where he associated himself with the party of the Mountain and voted in favor of the death penalty for King Louis XVI.

He was constantly employed on missions in the provinces and distinguished himself by his staunch repression of the anti-Revolution risings in the newly designed &quot;départements&quot; of Landes, Basses-Pyrénées, and Gers. He represented the Convention in the Revolutionary Armies of Brest and of the Eastern Pyrenees in 1793, and in 1795 he was sent to the armies of the Moselle and the Rhine. With his colleague Jacques Pinet (1754–1844), he established at Bayonne a revolutionary tribunal, with authority in the neighboring towns. He went on to unleash a terror campaign aimed at imposing the French revolutionary discipline in the region.

Cavaignac managed to escape prosecution during the Thermidorian Reaction, assisted Paul Barras in resisting to the 13 Vendémiaire insurgency, and was a member of the Council of Five Hundred for a short while during the French Directory. Cavaignac filled various minor administrative offices under the Consulate and French Empire and in 1806 became an official in Joachim Murat&#x27;s administration of the Kingdom of Naples. During the Hundred Days, he was &quot;préfet&quot; of the Somme. At the Bourbon Restoration, he was proscribed as a &quot;regicide&quot; and spent the last years of his life in Brussels, where he died.

==Appointment to Bayonne==
On appointment as chief executive representative of the Convention in the French army stationed in the Basses-Pyrénées along with Pinet and Monestier (as civil representatives), the inhabitants of the recently suppressed Basque province of Labourd were shocked by a number of excesses and abuses. The Convention official is reported to relish riding in a lavish carriage pulled by four white horses across Labourd. Each time he approached a community or town, e.g. Saint-Jean-de-Luz, its inhabitants were constrained to step over and cheer waving a laurel bouquet to the cry &quot;Long live Cavaignac, his colleagues, the Mountain and the Convention.&quot; His appointment was also followed by unrestrained revolutionary takeover and over-zeal, including a prohibition to use Basque in all public transactions and school (proclaiming that &quot;fanaticism speaks Basque&quot;), as well as the indiscriminate deportation of thousands of residents to the Landes of Gascony.

Estimations on the number of deportees range from 4,000 to 8,000, representing between a quarter and half of the inhabitants of 17 villages of southern Labourd, of which 1,600 never returned alive. A local society denounced Cavaignac for cruelty before a tribunal of the reshuffled Convention in 1795, who went on to acknowledge the consideration of victims to the civilians, but neither Cavaignac nor any other high-ranking official was held accountable.

During August 1794 in the context of the War of the Pyrenees, as the highest authority of the Convention in Bayonne, he was in charge of negotiations with the representatives of the bordering Basque Spanish district of Gipuzkoa seeking detachment from Spain and conditional allegiance to France. Cavaignac&#x27;s and Pinet&#x27;s confrontational and clean-sweep approach towards a possible Gipuzkoan protectorate by France broke any possibilities of an understanding with the regional authorities. Cavaignac went on to order their arrest and imprisonment in Bayonne, with the Gipuzkoans opting to turn their loyalty to the Spanish heir apparent Ferdinand VII and raise a militia against the French.

<text>QwaQwa was a Bantustan (&quot;homeland&quot;) in the central eastern part of South Africa. It encompassed a very small region of in the east of the former South African province of Orange Free State, bordering Lesotho. Its capital was Witsieshoek. It was the designated homeland of more than 180,000 Sesotho-speaking Basotho people.

The frequent snow on the Maloti mountain peaks led the San to call the region &quot;QwaQwa&quot; (whiter than white). In Afrikaans it was known as &quot;Witsieshoek&quot;, after Oetse (also Witsie and Wetsi), a Makholokoe chief who lived there from 1839 to 1856.

Three tribes lived in the region, the Makholokoe, Bakoena and the Batlokoa. In 1969 they were united and the area was named &quot;KwaKwa&quot;. In the same year, the name was changed to &quot;QwaQwa&quot; to avoid an ethnic identification.

==History==

On 1 November 1974, QwaQwa was granted self-government, with Tsiame Kenneth Mopeli as Chief Minister. Mopeli would serve as Chief Minister throughout QwaQwa&#x27;s existence.

After 27 April 1994, QwaQwa was dissolved, following the first South African democratic election, and reunited with Orange Free State. It is now part of the Free State province, with Witsieshoek serving as the seat of Maluti a Phofung Local Municipality.

The municipality also comprises the towns of Harrismith and Kestell. Together, they have a combined population of 385 413, of which about 80% lives in the former QwaQwa. The population is divided as follows: 98.09% Black; White 1.68%; Coloured 0.09% and Asian and/or Indian 0.13%.

The place was also a major educational centre in the old apartheid days, with at least 80% of schools in the present Free State province having teachers that were educated in the former homeland. It has a fully functional university, but its teachers&#x27; colleges have been turned into FETs (Further Education and Training) colleges. The university was called &quot;Uniqwa&quot; under the University of the North before 1994, but it since has been incorporated into the University of the Free State (UFS) and renamed &quot;UFS Qwaqwa Campus&quot;.

The Bantustan of QwaQwa had only one district in 1991, Witsieshoek, with a population of 342,886.

==Notable people from QwaQwa==

* Seipati Seoke - Lesedi FM Presenter and 2020 DStv Mzansi Viewers&#x27; Choice Awards
* Hlaudi Motsoeneng - African Content Movement (ACM) and former acting Chief operating officer of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC)

<text>François Rude (; 4 January 1784 – 3 November 1855) was a French sculptor, best known for the &quot;Departure of the Volunteers&quot;, also known as &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. (1835–36). His work often expressed patriotic themes, as well as the transition from neo-classicism to romanticism.

==Early life==
François Rude was born 4 January 1784 on rue Petite-Poissonnerie (rue François Rude) in Dijon. His father was a blacksmith and locksmith, who taught Rude the trade of forging iron, so he could take over the family business. In 1799, at the age of fifteen, despite his father&#x27;s resistance, he began taking courses at the School of Fine Arts in Dijon, located within the Palace of the Dukes of Burgundy, while continuing to work in the family business. His teacher was the deputy curator of the Dijon museum, Louis Fremiet. Rude learned both drawing and sculpture, using classical models. Fremiet helped protect Rude from being drafted into Napoleon&#x27;s army, and, in 1808, sent him to Paris to continue his studies.

Rude began his studies at the Imperial Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in August 1808 under Pierre Cartellier, a devotee of classical sculpture. His fellow students included several sculptors who later became prominent, including David d&#x27;Angers, James Pradier and the celebrated animalist Antoine-Louis Barye. While studying, he gained practical experience as an assistant to Edme Gaulle, who was making part of the sculptural frieze of the column being made for Place Vendôme to celebrate the victories of Napoleon. In 1809 he competed in the academy&#x27;s prestigious annual competition, and took second place with the purely classical &quot;Marius meditating upon the ruins of Carthage&quot;. In 1812, he won two competitions, one for the most expressive bust, with a work called &quot;attention combined with fear&quot;; and a second, &quot;Aristotle deploring the loss of his bees.&quot;. The latter work won the Grand Prize of the academy, Prix de Rome, and the opportunity to study at the French Academy in Rome. Unfortunately for Rude, the academy in Rome was having financial difficulties, and the departure of the winners was postponed. He was preparing again to depart for Rome in early 1815 when Napoleon returned from his exile in Elba and the war began again. After Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat at Waterloo and the second restoration of the French monarchy, Rude decided to go into self-imposed exile in Brussels. At the request of his teacher from Dijon, Louis Fremiet, he agreed to take with him to Brussels and look after Fremiet&#x27;s mother-in-law, aunt, and two daughters, including Sophie, who in 1821 became Rude&#x27;s wife.

==Exile in Brussels==
Rude lived in Brussels from 1817 until 1826. where he found many other self-imposed exiles, the most famous of whom was the painter Jacques-Louis David. Rude&#x27;s wife, a painter, became David&#x27;s pupil and then his copyist. In Brussels he made a bust of David, neoclassical in style, but realistically portraying the deformation of David&#x27;s mouth caused by a nervous malady.

In Brussels he received his first major commission; he was asked by the Belgian royal architect Charles Vander Straeten to design decorative relief sculptures for the hunting lodge of the Belgian crown prince at Tervuren. The work was a frieze around the rotunda of the Hall of Honor. Among the other artists selected to work on the frieze was Sophie Fremiet, also a painter, who became Rude&#x27;s wife. The friezes by Rude represented a classical hunting scene, &quot;The Hunt of Meleager&quot; for the entry portico and a series of eight reliefs for the rotunda, illustrating the life of Achilles. The work required representing dozens of figures, both in action scenes and scenes of pathos and drama. Rude based his work on the models of classical sculpture, but gave them exceptional naturalism and dynamism. The original work was destroyed by a fire in the lodge in 1879, but plaster copies made from the original moldings and illustrations survive.

==Return to Paris – classicism to romanticism==
Brussels did not offer enough opportunities or challenges, and in 1827 Rude returned to Paris with Sophie and entered a work in the Paris Salon of 1827. The work was shown only a short time before the Salon closed, and it attracted little attention, but it illustrated the evolution of his style. The statue, &quot;Mercury fastening his sandals after slaying Argus&quot; (now in the Louvre) was neoclassical in theme, but showed a striking energy and realism.

Rude decided to move permanently to Paris in 1828. He found a client in the French state, which commissioned him, along with several others sculptors, to work on a frieze for the Arc de Triomphe; he refined his technique and style. In 1833 he presented a new work, &quot;A young Neopolitan fisherman playing with tortoise&quot; a fusion of classicism and romanticism, vividly expressing emotion. This work won a cross of the Legion of Honor, sculpture.

==The Arc de Triomphe and &quot;Départ des Volontaires de 1792&quot;==
The Arc de Triomphe had been begun in 1806 by Napoleon to celebrate his victory at the battle of Austerlitz. It had only reached a height of nine meters when Napoleon was overthrown, and it was abandoned for years. During the Bourbon Restoration, Charles X of France had begun to work on it again, to make it a monument to celebrate the defeat of Spanish revolutionaries by a French royal expeditionary force. When Rude first arrived in Paris in 1828, based on his experience with the friezes in Tervuren, he became one of the sculptors working on the friezes, depicting the exploits of the royalist army in Spain.

The July Revolution of 1830 overthrew the royal government of the Charles X and put Louis Philippe on the throne. The new government decided to complete the construction of the Arc de Triomphe on a very different theme. Rude&#x27;s work at the Salon of 1833 had come to the attention of Adolphe Thiers, the new Minister of the Interior, who had taken office in 1832. Thiers was an art collector, and was familiar with Rude&#x27;s work at the 1828 salon. The royalist architect of the Arch was replaced, and Thiers put a new architect, Guillaume-Abel Blouet, who had political opinions closer to those of Rude, in charge of the project, with Rude to assist him. Rude was given the commission to make portions of the frieze depicting the departure of volunteers from Paris in 1792 to fight against the anti-revolutionary armies, as well as a frieze commemorating the triumphal returns to France of Napoleon&#x27;s expeditions to Egypt and Italy.

The &quot;Départ des volontaires de 1792&quot; (&quot;Departure of the Volunteers of 1792&quot;), also known as &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; completed in 1836, became Rude&#x27;s most famous work. It depicted the departure of a French revolutionary army to fight against a coalition of royalist forces at the Battle of Valmy in 1792. Sophie Fremiet, Rude&#x27;s wife, posed for the principal figure, the &quot;Génie de la Guerre&quot; (Genius of the War), a woman with a sword shouting to urge others on to battle. The pose of this figure resembled the central figure of the painting by Delacroix, &quot;Liberty leading the People&quot;, which had been purchased by the French government at the 1831 Salon, and shown briefly at the Luxembourg Museum until 1833. The fierce shouting expression had been used earlier by Rude as a student at the academy, in the competition for best facial expressions, which he won in 1812. The soldiers wore the costumes of warriors of ancient Gaul. The &quot;Depart des Volontaires de 1792&quot; immediately became famous for its vitality and energy, and as a celebration of the French revolutionary spirit. Auguste Rodin took up the same theme, with a similar shouting figure, in his &quot;La Defense&quot; (1879).

==Patriotic and historical statuary==
The critical and popular acclaim for the frieze on the Arc de Triomphe led to more commissions for Rude. King Louis-Philippe encouraged patriotic monuments, to bridge the deep political divide between monarchists and republicans. In 1832, Louis-Philippe commissioned Rude to make a statue of the Roman statesman Cato the Elder. In 1837, Louis-Philppe opened a museum within the largely-abandoned Palace of Versailles to honor the heroes of French history, and, as he declared, &quot;all the glories of France.&quot; Rude was commissioned in 1836, before the opening of the museum, to make a statue of a German-born French military hero from the 18th century, the Maurice de Saxe. This statue followed the traditions of heroic sculpture, presenting him a triumphal pose, holding his marshal&#x27;s baton. He also had patrons in the nobility; in 1843, he created a statue in silver of the adolescent Louis XIII, for the Duc de Luynes, whose family had been ennobled by Lous XIII. It was later recast in bronze. In 1845, Rude completed another statue devoted to French history; Joan of Arc, portrayed with her hand up, listing to the mystical voice calling her to fight for the liberty of France against the English invaders. Her hair has already been cut to prepare her for battle, and her armor is by her side.

Louis-Philippe was driven into exile in 1848, and the new and brief Second French Republic came to power. It commissioned Rude to make an heroic statue of Michel Ney, one of Napoleon&#x27;s most famous marshals, who had been shot for treason by the restored royalist government which replaced Napoleon. The earliest wax model made by Rude depicted Ney at his execution, as he opened his coat and urged the firing squad to &quot;aim for the heart.&quot; This pose was judged as too politically provocative, so Rude made a different version, depicting Ney, sword upraised, ordering his soldiers forward. This work, like his earlier &quot;Departure of the Volunteers&quot;, broke with academic tradition by showing Ney with his mouth open, shouting at his soldiers to follow. This work was completed in 1853, after the fall of the Second Republic and the rise of Napoleon III. It is found in the square in front of the Paris Observatory.

An unusual work in his period of patriotic sculptures was his tomb of Éléonore-Louis Godefroi Cavaignac, one of the leaders of the republican opposition to the monarchy, who had died in 1845. The sepulcher designed by Rude recalled those of the Middle Ages made for the Kings of France, particularly the tomb of Henry II of France sculpted by Germain Pilon. The figure of Cavaignac was depicted with great realism; the body was depicted under a plain sheet, and body was emaciated from his imprisonment by royal government. The sepulcher served a model for those of later opponents of the monarchy.

Another notable example of his patriotic work was &quot;Napoleon Awakening to Immortality&quot; (1845). The statue was made for Claude Noisot, who a former captain in Napoleon&#x27;s imperial guard and an officer of the Legion of Honor, who had accompanied Napoleon into exile on Elba, and at the Battle of Waterloo. He was unable to pursue a military career after Napoleon&#x27;s downfall, but with the help of a wealthy wife purchased vineyards and an estate at Fixin in Burgundy. At the time that the statue was conceived, the political climate in Paris was still hostile to Napoleon, and there were no monuments to him in the city. Therefore, Noisot and Rude planned for the sculpture of the Emperor to be placed on Noisot&#x27;s estate in Burgundy. The statue shows the Emperor, eyes closed, wearing a crown of laurel, under a military cloak, atop a rocky pedestal. An eagle, his symbol, is chained to the stone, and is crying out to awaken him, while the chains that held the Emperor have been broken. For years, elderly veterans of Napoleon&#x27;s army made pilgrimages to Fixin to honor Rude&#x27;s statue.

==Late works and death==
Late works by Rude included a Calvary in bronze for the high altar of St Vincent de Paul (1852). Late in his life, he was commissioned by the Museum of Fine Arts of Dijon to make a work on a subject of his choosing; he chose a mythological work, &quot;Hebe and the Eagle of Jupiter&quot; (1852). Other late works included &quot;Love Triumphant&quot; (1855–57; and &quot;Head of Christ&quot; (1852). After his death, the two unfinished works were completed by his student and nephew, Paul Cabet, and they were shown at the Paris Salon of 1857.

Rude received a medal for his lifetime work at the Paris International Exposition of 1855. Shortly afterwards, on 3 November 1855, Rude died at his Paris residence at rue d&#x27;Enfer 3. He was buried at Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.

Toward the end of his life, Rude made several notable religious sculptures, including the sculptural decoration of a pulpit for the Church of St. Etienne in Lille. His major religious works include a &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot; now in the Church of the Madeleine, and a smaller bust of &quot;Christ on the Cross&quot; finished in 1855, not long before his death, and now in the Louvre. The statue &quot;Love, dominator of the world&quot;, was one of his last works, commissioned by the Dijon Museum of Fine Arts. He died before it was completed. It was finished by his pupil and stepson Paul Cabet, and was shown in the Paris Salon of 1857.

The Dijon Museum of Fine Arts, the Musée d&#x27;Orsay and the Louvre have notable collections of his works.

==Pupils==
Rude&#x27;s pupil Charles-Auguste Lebourg became famous for the Wallace fountains in Paris. Another important pupil of Rude was Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, who subsequently executed his own interpretation of a Neapolitan Fisher Boy, a popular subject at the time.

==Musée Rude==
The Musée Rude in Dijon, inaugurated in 1947, is devoted to plaster casts of his works that were acquired by the city of Dijon, between 1887 and 1910; it is housed in the transept of the 11th-century church of Saint-Etienne in rue Vaillant.

<text>The skimmers, forming the genus Rynchops, are tern-like birds in the family Laridae. The genus comprises three species found in South Asia, Africa, and the Americas. They were formerly known as the scissorbills.
==Description==
The three species are the only birds with distinctive uneven bills, where the lower mandible is longer than the upper. This remarkable adaptation allows them to fish in a unique way, flying low and fast over streams. Their lower mandible skims or slices over the water&#x27;s surface, ready to snap shut any small fish unable to dart clear. The skimmers are sometimes included within the gull family Laridae but separated in other treatments which consider them as a sister group of the terns. The black skimmer has an additional adaptation and is the only species of bird known to have slit-shaped pupils. the forehead, ends of the secondaries, tail feathers and under parts are white, the rest of the plumage is black and the basal half of the bill is crimson. Their bills fall within their field of binocular vision, which enables them to carefully position their bill and capture prey. They are agile in flight and gather in large flocks along rivers and coastal sand banks.

They are tropical and subtropical species which lay 3–6 eggs on sandy beaches. The female incubates the eggs. Because of the species&#x27; restricted nesting habitat the three species are vulnerable to disturbance at their nesting sites. One species, the Indian skimmer, is considered endangered by the IUCN due to this as well as destruction and degradation of the lakes and rivers it uses for feeding.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Rynchops&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name &quot;Rynchops&quot; is from the Ancient Greek ῥυνχος/&quot;rhunkhos&quot; meaning &quot;bill&quot; and κοπτω/&quot;koptō&quot; meaning &quot;to cut off&quot;. The type species is the black skimmer (&quot;Rynchops niger&quot;).

As in later editions of the works of Linnaeus, the correct spelling (from the Greek words and , together meaning &quot;beak-face&quot;) should be &quot;rhynchops&quot; and this is often adopted. However, the misspelling &quot;rynchops&quot; was the one first published by Linnaeus and continues to be more commonly used. Similarly, the gender of the Greek and Roman words is feminine and the genus was originally treated as such (&quot;R. nigra&quot;) but &quot;Rynchops&quot; is now usually treated as a masculine noun (&quot;R. niger&quot;).

===Species===
The genus contains three species.

<doc id="209842" wikidata="Q2720082" url="?curid=209842" title="Fusobacterium">
<text>Fusobacterium is a genus of obligate anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-sporeforming bacteria belonging to Gracilicutes. Individual cells are slender, rod-shaped bacilli with pointed ends. &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; was discovered in 1900 by Courmont and Cade and is common in the flora of humans.

Strains of &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; can cause several human diseases and infections, including periodontal diseases, 
Lemierre&#x27;s syndrome, oral, head, and neck infections, as well as colorectal cancer and topical skin ulcers.

It has been tied to HIV infection and suboptimal immune recovery. Detection of &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; is typically through surgical retrieval of tissue, fecal tests, or blood tests in patients showing symptoms. Early detection is preferred and helps to prevent further disease progression.

Although older sources state that &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; is part of the normal flora of the human oropharynx, the current consensus is that &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; should always be treated as a pathogen. There are thirteen described &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; strains; the predominant one affecting humans is &quot;F. nucleatum&quot;, followed by &quot;F. necrophorum&quot;, which also affects animals, mainly cattle.

== Background ==

=== History ===
Although the genus was not discovered until 1900 by Courmont and Cade, the first documented &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; infection was reported in 1898 by Veillon and Zuber, who described a case of systemic infection in a young child. The genus was proposed by Knorr in 1923. &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; has been classically considered a normal part of the human oral, gastrointestinal, and female genital flora, which is why infections are not commonly seen.

==Clinical relevance==
&quot;Fusobacterium&quot; is often associated with ulcerative colitis. Research of colon cancer has also shown an overrepresentation of &quot;Fusobacterium&quot;, both in feces of patients and tumor tissue itself. &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; has also been seen increased in individuals infected with HIV as well as in individuals with suboptimal immune recovery as compared to patients who were not infected and had optimal responses.

=== Prevalent pathogenic species ===
&quot;F. nucleatum&quot; is found in humans more so than any other species of &quot;Fusobacterium&quot;. It is commonly found in the oral cavity as well as in the intestinal tract. Some of its pathogenic ties include its extraction from amniotic fluid sourced from spontaneous premature labor without reason/a given source. A few additional sources of its pathogenic nature include its association with oral inflammation diseases, cancers such as pancreatic, oral, and colorectal, as well as infections of the head and neck. This association is due to the high increase in the prevalence of &quot;F. nucleatum&quot; in those infected areas. &quot;F. nucleatum&quot; can worsen or initiate colorectal cancer by stimulating other bacteria such as &quot;Streptococcus, Campylobacter spp.&quot; and &quot;Leptotrichia&quot; as well as cancerous gene expression from Beta-catenin signaling. &quot;F. nucleatum&quot; can be detected in tissues, genomic DNA, and feces using methods such as (FQ, q, and dd) polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization. However, these are limited because tissues can only be tested after surgery and fecal matter can return false positive results.

&quot;F. necrophorum&quot; has been found as a common pathogen in the diagnostic of peritonsillar abscess and is more prevalent than other bacteria regarding this infection. It is also the most frequent leading cause associated with Lemierre Syndrome and is not proven to be a normal part of the human oral bacterium population. &quot;F. necrophorum&quot; commonly infects animals, causing liver abscesses and necrodic diseases, and can combine with other pathogenic bacteria to cause various infections such as foot rot and uterine infections.

=== Sources of other species of &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; ===

Source:

* &quot;F. ulcerans&quot; is very similar to &quot;F. varium&quot; and is commonly extracted from tropical ulcers.
* &quot;F. necrogenes&quot; is also closely related to &quot;F. ulcerans&quot; and &quot;F. varium&quot; and has been found in chickens and ducks.
* &quot;F. perfoetans&quot; is sourced from fecal matter. (&quot;F. perfoetans&quot; and &quot;F. necrogenes&quot; have not been sourced from any infections in humans or animals)
* &quot;F. gonidiaformans&quot; is typically found in the intestines of humans and is not found orally like the other &quot;Fusobacterium.&quot;
* &quot;F. russi&quot; is a common bacteria in canine and feline oral cavities and can lead to the infection of puncture wounds if transferred to humans from bites. 
* &quot;F. simae&quot; which can be sourced from monkeys.

=== Symptoms and treatment ===
&quot;Fusobacterium&quot; infections often cause clinical symptoms such as a fever, inflammation, and a diseased appearance. Further diagnosis can confirm suspicions of &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; infection through blood testing or culturing the tissue. Upon diagnosing the infection, action to treat it involves the application of antibiotics over a 2-week period which could be in the form of penicillin or other variants as well as using anaerobic antibiotics like clindamycin and metronidazole which work when the &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; can break down the Beta-lactams. Leaving &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; untreated could lead to more severe developments of the infection and early testing is recommended. By testing early, fatal diseases such as Lemierre syndrome can be avoided. However, this requires the family physician to be conscious of the danger as infections such as Lemierre syndrome affects younger populations and especially those of male gender. The bacterium is a big anchor for biofilms. It is usually susceptible to clindamycin, while approximately 20% of the clinical strains are resistant to penicillin. In contrast to &quot;Bacteroides&quot; spp., &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; has a potent lipopolysaccharide.

==Taxonomy==
=== Current species ===
&quot;Fusobacterium&quot; is divided into 13 different species, two of which each have their own set of subspecies (&quot;F. nucleatum&quot; and &quot;F. necrophorum&quot;).

=== Reclassified species ===
Other previously declared species of Fusobacterium such as &quot;F. symbiosum, F. praecutum, F. plauti,&quot; &quot;F. alocis, F. sulci,&quot; and &quot;F. prausnitzii&quot; have since been reclassified due to containing different characteristics from the other &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; members. &quot;F. alocis&quot; has been reclassified into &quot;Filifactor alocis&quot; while &quot;F. sulci&quot; has been reclassified as &quot;Eubacterium sulci. F. prausnitzii&quot; is a part of the &quot;Clostridium leptum&quot; subgroup under &quot;Eubacterium-&quot;like organisms. A few strains &quot;F. prausnitzii&quot;, a gut commensal associated with healthy patients, was completely reclassified as &quot;Faecalibacterium&quot; (&quot;Clostridiales&quot;:&quot;Ruminococcaceae&quot;) in 2002.

<doc id="209843" wikidata="Q296023" url="?curid=209843" title="Jean-de-Dieu Soult">
<text>Marshal General Jean-de-Dieu Soult, 1st Duke of Dalmatia (; 29 March 1769 – 26 November 1851) was a French general and statesman. He was a Marshal of the Empire during the Napoleonic Wars, and served three times as President of the Council of Ministers (prime minister) of France.

Son of a country notary from southern France, Soult enlisted in the French Royal Army in 1785 and quickly rose through the ranks during the French Revolution. He was promoted to brigadier general after distinguishing himself at the Battle of Fleurus in 1794, and by 1799 he was a division general. In 1804, Napoleon made Soult one of his first eighteen Marshals of the Empire. Soult played a key role in many of Napoleon&#x27;s campaigns, most notably at the Battle of Austerlitz, where his corps delivered the decisive attack that secured French victory. He was subsequently created Duke of Dalmatia and from 1808, he commanded French forces during the Peninsular War. Despite several initial victories, for instance at the Battle of Ocaña, Soult was eventually outmaneuvered and driven out of Spain by the coalition forces under the command of Arthur Wellesley (later Duke of Wellington). He was again defeated by Wellington at Toulouse in 1814, days after Napoleon&#x27;s first abdication. Soult declared himself a royalist following the Bourbon Restoration, but rejoined Napoleon during the Hundred Days. He was Napoleon&#x27;s chief of staff during the Waterloo campaign in 1815, where the emperor suffered a final defeat.

Following the second restoration, Soult went into exile in Germany. In 1819 he was recalled to France and returned to royal favour, and in 1830 he was made Minister of War after the July Revolution. Soult oversaw reforms of the French military and was responsible for the creation of the French Foreign Legion. Under King Louis Philippe, he was three times French prime minister from 1832 to 1834, almost a year between 1839 and 1840 and from 1840 to 1847. In 1847, he was awarded the title Marshal General of France. Soult again declared himself a Republican after Louis Philippe&#x27;s overthrow in the French Revolution of 1848. He died in 1851.

==Early life==
Soult was born in Saint-Amans-la-Bastide (now called Saint-Amans-Soult in his honor, near Castres, in the Tarn department) and named after John of God. He was the son of a country notary named Jean Soult (1726–1779) by his marriage to Brigitte, daughter of Pierre François de Grenier de Lapierre. He was a Catholic.

Jean-de-Dieu Soult was expected to have a promising career as a lawyer. However, on 16 April 1785, at the age of sixteen, he enlisted as a private in the &quot;Royal-Infanterie&quot; regiment, to help his mother financially after the death of his father. His younger brother, Pierre-Benoît Soult, followed his example three years later, and would also become a French general.

==Revolutionary Wars==
Jean Soult fought in the wars of Revolutionary France. Soult&#x27;s superior education ensured his promotion to the rank of sergeant after six years of service, and in July 1791 he became instructor to the first battalion of volunteers of the Bas-Rhin. On 17 January 1792 his colonel appointed him instructor in the 1st battalion of Haut-Rhin volunteers, with the rank of second lieutenant (&quot;sous-lieutenant&quot;). The war period, which began in April 1792, offered him many opportunities to stand out and he rose through the ranks with regularity. Adjutant-major on 16 July 1792, captain on 20 August 1793, provisional adjutant to the staff of General Lazare Hoche to the Army of the Moselle on 19 November 1793. He took part in the Battle of Kaiserslautern from 28 to 30 November, which allowed the recapture of Wissembourg and the relief of Landau. Hoche gives Soult the command of a detached body to take Marsthal&#x27;s camp, a task which was brilliantly executed.

From 26 to 29 December he was present at the Second Battle of Wissembourg. He was appointed chief of staff of the avant-garde on 27 January 1794, provisional battalion commander on 7 February 1794, titular battalion commander on 3 April and adjutant-general brigade chief (&quot;adjudant-général chef de brigade&quot;) on 14 May. On 19 March 1794 the Army of the Moselle was replaced by the Army of the Rhine under the command of General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan. This army immediately returns to the campaign. Two battles were fought in Arlon on 17, 18 and 29 April, then on 21 May, in which Soult took an active part.

After the Battle of Fleurus of 1794, in which he distinguished himself for coolness, he joined the Army of Sambre and Meuse on 28 June. Soult was promoted to brigadier general by the representatives on mission. For the next five years, Soult was employed in Germany under Generals Jean-Baptiste Jourdan (a veteran of the American War of Independence and a future Marshal), Jean Victor Marie Moreau, Jean-Baptiste Kléber and François Lefebvre (also a future Marshal). He took part in the Battle of Aldenhoven on 2 October 1794. He moved to Jacques Hatry&#x27;s division and took part in the Siege of Luxembourg from 22 November to 7 June 1795. He took a brilliant part in the battles of Altenkirchen on 4 June 1796, of Friedberg on 10 July 1796, and in the Battle of Stockach against the army of Charles of Austria on 25 March 1799. The rank of division general was attributed to him on 4 April 1799, provisionally, and it is confirmed on the following 21 April.

Soult passed to the Army of Helvetia under the orders of General André Masséna (another future Marshal). It was at this time that he built the bases of his military reputation, in particular during the First Battle of Zurich of 2–5 June 1799; then he subdued the insurgent cantons, drove the rebels on the Reuss and drove them back to in the valley of Urseren - relieving Frauenfeld, Altikon, Audelfinden. He obtained a citation on the order of the day of 2 June 1799. On the 10th of the same month, he hunted down, at the head of the &quot;110th Demi-Brigade&quot;, the Austrians, occupying Mount Albis. Crossing the Linth River on 22 September, Soult led the enemy to suffer a loss of 4,000 men, then he came to meet the Russians who advanced on Kaltbrunn, forcing the surrender of a body of 2,000 men, seized Weesen and pushed the enemy back to Lake Constance. He won a significant victory at the battle of the Linth (25 to 26 September). Moreover, he had the honour of coordinating the actions of Gazan&#x27;s and Molitor&#x27;s divisions, which halted the advance of Suvorov&#x27;s army at the battle of Näfels.

== Consulate Era ==

When in 1800 the First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte entrusted Masséna to reorganize the Army of Italy, he insisted that Soult be his deputy; giving him the command of the right wing.

Soult distinguished himself for his active part in the defense of the country of Genoa. On 6 April, in an initial sortie, at the head of several battalions, he crossed the Austrian army and relieved General Gardanne. The enemy was repulsed beyond Piotta, and Soult pursued General Suvorov into the Alps, seizing Sassello and returning to Genoa with numerous prisoners, cannons, and flags. During another sortie, the general pushed in against the Austrian army, trapping a division at Monte-Facio. But, during a fight in Montecreto on 13 April 1800, a gunshot shattered his leg; lying on the battlefield wounded, he was robbed and taken prisoner, spending days in agony in a filthy hospital. This experience traumatized Soult, and he would never again place himself so forward in the battleline.

He was rescued after the victory at Marengo on 14 June 1800. Appointed military commander of Piedmont, then in the midst of a rebellion, Soult managed to put down the so-called Barbets insurrection. He even managed to discipline the rowdy hordes and use them for his service. Soult then received command of the southern part of the Kingdom of Naples.

Shortly before the Treaty of Amiens, General Soult returned to Paris, where the First Consul welcomed him with the highest distinction. On 5 March 1802 he was one of the four generals called to command the Consular Guard with the post of colonel general. He thereafter pledged allegiance to the new regime. In August 1803, Soult was entrusted with the command-in-chief of the Camp of Boulogne. Soult, a former drill instructor, imposed a rigorous discipline there, which ensured the effectiveness of French troops during future campaigns, and also earned him the nickname &quot;Bras de Fer&quot; (&quot;Iron Arm&quot;). Even Napoleon wondered if he was being too severe, to which assertions Soult replied:&quot;Those who can&#x27;t handle what I myself endure will be left behind in the depots. Those that can will be fit to conquer the world.&quot;

==Napoleonic Wars==
===Marshal of the Empire===
In May 1804, Soult was made one of the first eighteen Marshals of the Empire. He commanded a corps in the advance on Ulm, and at Austerlitz he led the decisive attack on the Allied centre.
Soult played a great part in many of the famous battles of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, including the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805 and the Battle of Jena in 1806. However, he was not present at the Battle of Friedland because on that same day he was capturing Königsberg. After the conclusion of the Treaties of Tilsit, he returned to France and in 1808 was anointed by Napoleon as 1st Duke of Dalmatia (French: &quot;Duc de Dalmatie&quot;). The awarding of this honour greatly displeased him, for he felt that his title should have been Duke of Austerlitz, a title which Napoleon had reserved for himself. In the following year, Soult was appointed as commander of the II Corps with which Napoleon intended to conquer Spain. After winning the Battle of Gamonal, Soult was detailed by the emperor to pursue Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore&#x27;s British army. At the Battle of Coruña, in which Moore was killed, Soult failed to prevent British forces escaping by sea.

===Peninsular War===
For the next four years, Soult remained in Spain engaged in the Peninsular War. In 1809, he invaded Portugal and took Porto, but was isolated by General Francisco da Silveira&#x27;s strategy of contention. Busying himself with the political settlement of his conquests in French interests and, as he hoped, for his own ultimate benefit as a possible candidate for the Portuguese throne, he attracted the hatred of Republican officers in his army. Unable to move, he was eventually driven from Portugal in the Second Battle of Porto by Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Wellesley (later made Duke of Wellington), making a painful and almost disastrous retreat over the mountains, pursued by General William Beresford and Silveira. After the Battle of Talavera, Soult was made chief of staff of French forces in Spain with extended powers, and on 19 November 1809, won a great victory at the Battle of Ocana.

In 1810, he invaded Andalusia, which he quickly overran. However, because he then turned to seize Seville, the capture of Cádiz eluded him, saying, &quot;Give me Seville and I will answer for Cádiz.&quot; This led to the prolonged and futile Siege of Cadiz, a strategic disaster for the French. In 1811, Soult marched north into Extremadura and took Badajoz. When the Anglo-Portuguese army laid siege to the city, he marched to its rescue and fought and nearly won the famous and bloody Battle of Albuera on 16 May.

In 1812, after Wellington&#x27;s great victory at Salamanca, Soult was obliged to evacuate Andalusia. In the subsequent Siege of Burgos, he was able to drive Wellington&#x27;s Anglo-allied Army back to Salamanca. There, the Duke of Dalmatia, as Soult was now known, failed to attack Wellington despite superiority in numbers, and the British Army retired to the Portuguese frontier. Soon after, he was recalled from Spain at the request of Joseph Bonaparte (who had been installed by his brother as King of Spain) with whom, as with the other marshals, he had always disagreed.

===In Germany and defending southern France===
In March 1813, Soult assumed command of the IV Corps of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; and commanded the centre at Lützen and Bautzen, but he was soon sent, with unlimited powers, to the South of France to repair the damage done by the defeat at Vitoria. It is to Soult&#x27;s credit that he was able to reorganise the demoralised French forces.

His last offensives into Spain were turned back by Wellington in the Battle of the Pyrenees (Sorauren) and by General Manuel Freire&#x27;s Spaniards at San Marcial. Pursued onto French soil, Soult was maneuvered out of several positions at Nivelle, Nive, and Orthez, before suffering what was technically a defeat at Wellington&#x27;s hands at the Battle of Toulouse. He nevertheless inflicted severe casualties on Wellington and was able to stop him from trapping the French forces.

===Hundred Days and Waterloo===
After Napoleon&#x27;s first abdication in 1814, Soult declared himself a royalist, received the Order of Saint Louis, and acted as minister of war from 26 November 1814 to 11 March 1815. When Napoleon returned from Elba, Soult at once declared himself a Bonapartist, was made a peer of France, and acted as chief of staff to the emperor during the Waterloo campaign, in which role he distinguished himself far less than he had done as commander of an over-matched army.

In his book, &quot;&quot;, Bernard Cornwell summarizes the opinions of several historians that Soult&#x27;s presence in the Army of the North was one of several factors contributing to Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, because of the animosity between him and Marshal Michel Ney, the other senior commander, and because, in spite of his experience as a soldier, Soult lacked his predecessor Marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier&#x27;s administrative skills. The most glaring instance of this was his written order, according to Napoleon&#x27;s instructions, to Marshal Emmanuel de Grouchy to position his force on the Anglo-allied army&#x27;s left flank in order to prevent reinforcement by the Prussians. Cornwell decries the wording of Soult&#x27;s order as &quot;almost impenetrable nonsense&quot;, and Grouchy misinterpreted the order, instead marching against the Prussian rearguard at Wavre.

== Political career ==
Following the Second Bourbon Restoration in 1815, Soult went into exile in Germany, but in 1819 he was recalled and in 1820 again made a Marshal of France. He once more tried to show himself as a fervent royalist and was made a peer in 1827. After the revolution of 1830 he declared himself a partisan of Louis Philippe, who welcomed his support and revived for him the title of Marshal General of France, previously held only by Turenne, Claude Louis Hector de Villars, and Maurice de Saxe.

=== Creation of the French Foreign Legion ===
As Minister of War (1830 to 1834), Soult organized and oversaw the rearmament of the French military. The strength of the Army of the Restoration numbered only a little over 200,000 men and Soult sought to double its size, carrying the necessary reforms from 1831 to 1832. The first law of this important military reform was that creating the Foreign Legion, on 9 March 1831; a force of foreign volunteers which could only be used outside the territory of metropolitan France, especially aimed at garrisoning the recently conquered Algiers. The Legion, when created, was loathed by the army and considered a lower posting; the force being colloquially called as the &quot;Bastard of Soult&quot;.

=== Military reforms ===
Louis-Philippe, worried about having to rely solely on the National Guard to maintain public order, instructed Marshal Soult to reorganize the line army without delay. Soult wrote a report to the king, presented to the Chamber of Deputies on 20 February 1831, in which he criticized the recruitment Gouvion-Saint-Cyr law of 1818: the voluntary system combined with the drawing of ballots and the possibility of being replaced had not made it possible to increase the number of manpower sufficiently, and that the promotion procedures helped to maintain over-staffing. Soult proposed the main lines of a military policy aimed at increasing the army&#x27;s strength, reducing said over-staffing and ensuring the supply of arms and ammunition.

Following the creation of the Legion on 9 March, Soult passed the laws of 11 April 1831 on military pensions, of 21 March and 14 April 1832, on army recruitment and promotion, and of 19 May 1834 on the status of officers. Soult also oversaw the construction of the fortifications of Paris. In 1831, he was sent by Louis-Philippe to Lyon with 20,000 men to crush the first insurrection of the city&#x27;s silk workers, the canuts. Order is restored, but Soult becomes very unpopular within the Republican camp. In his play &quot;Napoléon Bonaparte ou Trente ans de l&#x27;histoire de France&quot; (Napoleon Bonaparte or Thirty Years of the History of France), Dumas Père represents him in a dreadful appearance during the Hundred Days.

In 1834, when a new insurrection broke out in April in Lyon, Marshal Soult received from Lieutenant-General Aymar, commander of the troops in the city, a desperate telegraphic dispatch about evacuating the city. The Duke of Dalmatia&#x27;s firm response was not long in coming, chastising the general and ordering him to hold all his positions and to man the walls and be buried beneath them.

=== Prime minister ===
While he was minister of war, he held the presidency of the Council of Ministers (or Prime Minister) for the first time in 1832–1834. France being the guarantor of the Treaty of the XXIV articles, he had the Antwerp expedition carried out by Marshal Gérard, who seized the city after heroic resistance from the Dutch (December 1832) and returned it to Belgium, its country of attribution.

In April 1838, Louis-Philippe chose Soult to represent him at the coronation of Queen Victoria. He received a triumphant welcome in London – where his former enemy, the Duke of Wellington, reputedly caught him by the arm and exclaimed &quot;I have you at last!&quot;

Once again at the head of the government (1839–1840), he was at the same time the holder of the Foreign Affairs portfolio. He participated in the ceremonies for returning the ashes of Napoleon in December 1840.

President of the Council for almost seven years, from 1840 to 1847, he left the effective management of the Cabinet to his minister of foreign affairs, François Guizot, who logically succeeded him when he left the government, for health reasons. For five years (1840–1845), he combined his function with that of minister of war. On 26 September 1847 Louis-Philippe restored for him the honorary dignity of Marshal General of the king&#x27;s camps and armies, however modifying this title into the unique Marshal General of France.

During his term as Prime Minister and Minister for War he attempted to cover up the indiscriminate killings of Algerian civilians who died of suffocation following French troops lighting fires at the entrances to Caves in which they had fled, the story nonetheless leaked to the press. 

In 1848, Soult declared himself a republican. He died three years later in his castle in Soult-Berg, near Saint-Amans-la-Bastide where he was born, a few days before the coup of 1851. In his honor, the town was renamed Saint-Amans-Soult in December 1851. He is one of the eighteen Marshals of the Empire (out of twenty-six) who belonged to Freemasonry.

==Works==
Soult published a memoir justifying his adherence to Napoleon during the Hundred Days, and his notes and journals were arranged by his son Napoleon Hector, who published the first part &quot;Mémoires du maréchal-général Soult&quot; (Memories of Marshal-General Soult) in 1854. Le Noble&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires sur les operations des Français en Galicie&quot; (Memories of the Operations of the French in Galicia) are supposed to have been written from Soult&#x27;s papers.

==Military capability==
Although often found wanting tactically – even some of his own aides questioned his inability to amend a plan to take into account altered circumstances on the battlefield – Soult&#x27;s performance in the closing months of the Peninsular War is often regarded as proof of his fine talents as a general. Repeatedly defeated in these campaigns by the Allies under Wellington, it was the case that many of his soldiers were raw conscripts while the Allies could count greater numbers of veterans among their ranks. Soult was a skillful military strategist. An example was his drive to cut off Wellington&#x27;s British army from Portugal after Talavera, which nearly succeeded. Though repeatedly defeated by Wellington in 1813–1814, he conducted a clever defence against him.

Soult&#x27;s armies were usually well readied before going into battle. After Vitoria, he reorganized the demoralized French forces of Joseph Bonaparte into a formidable army in a remarkably short time. An exception to this good logistical record was launching the Battle of the Pyrenees offensive when his soldiers only had four days&#x27; rations.
Tactically, Soult planned his battles well, but often left too much to his subordinates. Wellington said that &quot;Soult never seemed to know how to handle troops after a battle had begun&quot;. An example of this was at the Battle of Albuera, where he brilliantly turned Beresford&#x27;s flank to open the battle, yet when he found himself facing unexpected opposition from British and Spanish troops, he allowed his generals to adopt a clumsy attack formation and was beaten. Another example of his strengths and weaknesses can be seen at the Battle of the Nive. Soult recognized Wellington&#x27;s strategic dilemma and took advantage by launching surprise attacks on both wings of the Anglo-Allied Army. But French tactical execution was poor and the British general managed to fend off Soult&#x27;s blows. Sloppy staff work marred his tenure as Napoleon&#x27;s chief of staff in the Waterloo campaign.

In the early twentieth century the British named the Royal Navy monitor HMS Marshal Soult after him.

==Marriage and children==
On 26 April 1796, Soult married Johanna Louise Elisabeth Berg (1771–1852), the daughter of Johann Abraham Berg (1730–1786) by his marriage to Wilhelmine Mumm in Solingen. She died at the Château de Soult-Berg on 22 March 1852. The couple had three children:
* Napoléon (1802–1857), 2nd Duke of Dalmatia, who died without male heir, at which time the title became extinct
* Hortense (1804–1862)
* Caroline (1817–1817)

<doc id="209844" wikidata="Q683063" url="?curid=209844" title="Birmingham New Street railway station">
<text>Birmingham New Street, also known as New Street station, is the largest and busiest of the three main railway stations in Birmingham city centre, England, and a central hub of the British railway system. It is a major destination for Avanti West Coast services from , , and and West Midlands Trains services from and London Euston both via the West Coast Main Line. The CrossCountry network centres on New Street, as well as local and suburban services within the West Midlands; these include those on the Cross-City Line between , and , and the Chase Line to and . The three-letter station code is BHM.

The station is named after New Street, which runs parallel to the station, although the station has never had a direct entrance from New Street except via the Grand Central shopping centre. Historically, the main entrance to the station was on Stephenson Street, just off New Street. As of 2022, the station has entrances on Stephenson Street, Smallbrook Queensway, Hill Street and Navigation Street.

New Street is the thirteenth busiest railway station in the UK and the busiest outside London, with 35.3 million passenger entries and exits between April 2023 and March 2024. It is also the busiest interchange station outside London, with over 5 million passengers changing trains at the station annually. In 2018, New Street had a passenger satisfaction rating of 92%, the third highest in the UK.

The original New Street station opened in 1854. At the time of its construction, the station had the largest single-span arched roof in the world. In the 1960s, the station was completely rebuilt. An enclosed station, with buildings over most of its span and passenger numbers more than twice those it was designed for, the replacement was not popular with its users. A £550m redevelopment of the station named Gateway Plus opened in September 2015; it includes a new concourse, a new exterior facade and a new entrance on Stephenson Street.

==History==
===The first railway stations===

New Street station was built in central Birmingham by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) between 1846 and 1854, on the site of several streets in a marshy area known as &quot;The Froggery&quot;; it replaced several earlier rail termini on the outskirts of the centre, most notably Curzon Street, which had opened in 1838 and was no longer adequate for the level of traffic. Samuel Carter, solicitor to both LNWR and the Midland Railway, managed the conveyancing.

The LNWR originally shared the station with the Midland Railway; however, in 1885, the Midland Railway opened its own extension alongside the original station for the exclusive use of its trains, effectively creating two stations side by side. The two companies&#x27; stations were separated by a central roadway, Queens Drive. Traffic grew steadily and, by 1900, New Street had an average of 40 trains an hour departing and arriving, rising to 53 trains in the peak hours.

==== Original LNWR station====

In 1846, the LNWR had obtained an act of Parliament, the (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. ccclix), to extend their line into the centre of Birmingham, which involved the acquisition of some of land and the demolition of around 70 houses in Peck Lane, The Froggery, Queen Street and Colmore Street. The Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Connexion chapel, on the corner of Peck Lane and Dudley Street, which had only been built six years before, was also demolished. The station was formally opened on 1 June 1854, although the uncompleted station had already been in use for two years as a terminus for trains from the Stour Valley Line, which entered the station from the Wolverhampton direction. On the formal opening day, the LNWR&#x27;s Curzon Street station was closed to regular passenger services and trains from the London direction started using New Street.

The station was constructed by Messrs. Fox, Henderson &amp; Co. and designed by Edward Alfred Cowper of that firm, who had previously worked on the design of the Crystal Palace. When completed, New Street had the largest arched single-span iron and glass roof in the world, spanning a width of and being long. It held this title for 14 years until St Pancras station opened in 1868. It was originally intended to have three spans, supported by columns; however, it was soon realised that the supporting columns would severely restrict the workings of the railway. Cowper&#x27;s single-span design, was therefore adopted, even though it was some 62 feet (19 metres) wider than the widest roof span at that time. George Gilbert Scott praised Cowper&#x27;s roof at New Street, stating &quot;An iron roof in its most normal condition is too spider-like a structure to be handsome, but with a very little attention this defect is obviated. The most wonderful specimen, probably, is that at the great Birmingham Station…&quot; When first opened, New Street was described as the &quot;Grand Central Station at Birmingham&quot; by Richard Foster.

The internal layout of tracks and platforms was designed by Robert Stephenson and his assistants; the station contained a total of nine platforms, comprising four through and five bay platforms. The main entrance building on Stephenson Street incorporated Queens Hotel, designed by John William Livock, which was opened on the same day. It was built in an Italianate style and was originally provided with 60 rooms. The hotel was expanded several times over the years and reached its final form in 1917, with the addition of a new west wing. The scale of the station at this time was documented in the station&#x27;s entry in the 1863 edition of &quot;Bradshaw&#x27;s Guide&quot;:

The roof of the original station was strengthened with additional steel tie bars during 1906–07, as a precaution following the collapse of a similar roof which killed six people at Charing Cross station in 1905.

====Midland Railway extension====

Midland Railway trains that had used Curzon Street began to use New Street from 1854; however, its use by the Midland Railway was limited by the fact that those trains going between Derby and Bristol would have to reverse, so many trains bypassed New Street and ran through Camp Hill. This was remedied in 1885, when a new link to the south, the Birmingham West Suburban Railway, was extended into New Street, which allowed through trains to and from the south-west to run via New Street without reversing.

To cope with the increase in traffic that this would bring, the station required an extension, the construction of which began in 1881. A number of buildings, mostly along Dudley Street, were demolished to make room for it, including a number of cottages, some business premises and a small church. Built immediately to the south of the original station, the extension contained four through platforms and one bay. It consisted of a trainshed with a glass and steel roof comprising two trussed arches, wide by long, and wide by long. It was designed by Francis Stevenson, chief engineer to the LNWR. The extension was opened on 8 February 1885. On completion, New Street had nearly doubled in size and became one of the largest stations in Britain, covering an area of over .

In early 1885, the number of daily users of the station was surveyed. On a Thursday, the number was 22,452 and on a Saturday it was 25,334.

Initially, the extension was used by both the LNWR and Midland Railway but, from 1889, it was only used by Midland Railway trains. It was separated from the original LNWR trainshed by Queens Drive, which became a central carriageway, but the two were linked by a footbridge which ran over Queens Drive and across the entire width of both the LNWR and Midland stations. Queens Drive was lost in the 1960s rebuild, but the name was later carried by a new driveway, which served the car park and a tower block, and is the access route for the station&#x27;s taxis.

On 1 February 1910, the LNWR introduced a &quot;City to City&quot; service between New Street and Broad Street, in the City of London. The service only lasted for five years, before being withdrawn on 22 February 1915, as a result of the First World War.

====LMS and British Rail====

In 1923, the LNWR and Midland Railway, with others, were grouped into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) by the Railways Act 1921. In 1948, the railways were nationalised and came under the control of British Railways.

During the Second World War, Cowper&#x27;s roof sustained extensive bomb damage as a result of air raids during the Birmingham Blitz. After the war, the remains of the roof were dismantled after being deemed beyond economic repair. It was replaced with austere canopies over the platforms, made from surplus war materials, which remained in use until the station was rebuilt in the 1960s.

===1960s rebuild===
The station was completely rebuilt in the 1960s, as part of the modernisation programme for the West Coast Main Line. Demolition of the old station and Queens Hotel began in 1964 and was not completed until 1966. The rebuilt New Street station was opened on 6 March 1967 to coincide with the introduction of electric expresses on the West Coast Main Line. It cost £4.5 million to build ().

The new station was designed by Kenneth J. Davies, lead planner for British Rail London Midland Region. Twelve through platforms replaced the eight through and six bay platforms of the previous station. The platforms were covered over by a concrete deck, supported by 200 columns, upon which the concourse and other buildings were constructed. Escalators, stairs and lifts were provided to reach the platforms from the concourse. The new station had sold its air rights, leading to the construction of the Pallasades Shopping Centre (then known as the Birmingham Shopping Centre) above the station between 1968 and 1970. The public right of way across the station, which had previously been maintained by the station footbridge, was retained in the new station via a winding route through the shopping centre. The station and the Pallasades were partly integrated with the Bullring Shopping Centre via elevated walkways above Smallbrook Queensway.

Also above the station was a nine-storey office block called Ladywood House, and a multi-storey car park dating from the 1970s. The car park closed in May 2012; it was demolished to provide space for the new concourse and was rebuilt. Stephenson Tower, a 20-storey residential tower block, was built alongside the station between 1965 and 1966. The tower, designed by the City Architect of Birmingham, was demolished in March 2012 as part of the station redevelopment.

In 1987, twelve different horse sculptures by Kevin Atherton, titled &quot;Iron Horse&quot;, were erected between New Street station and Wolverhampton at a cost of £12,000. One stands on platform 7 at New Street.

Due to its enclosed sub-surface platforms, New Street was designated as an underground station by the fire service. In the 1990s, a number of changes had to be made to the station in order to comply with stricter fire regulations, introduced for underground stations as a result of the 1987 King&#x27;s Cross fire. In 1993, a new enclosed footbridge was opened at the Wolverhampton end of the station, with access to the platforms separate from the main building; this was built primarily as a fire exit, but the new exit from the station into Navigation Street was opened to the public. All wooden fittings were removed from the platforms and new fire doors were also installed at the foot of the stairs and elevators on the platforms.

By the 2000s, the station was unpopular with its users. In a 2007 survey, it scored a customer satisfaction rate of only 52%, the joint lowest of any Network Rail major stations along with Liverpool Lime Street and East Croydon. The station had become inadequate for the level of traffic with which it was dealing; it had been designed with capacity for 650 trains and 60,000 passengers per day. In 2008, there were 1,350 trains and over 120,000 passengers per day. By 2013, it was 140,000 passengers per day. This made overcrowding and closures on safety grounds more common. Furthermore, the 1960s concrete architecture and enclosed design was widely criticised on aesthetic grounds. In November 2003, the station was voted the second biggest &quot;eyesore&quot; in the UK by readers of &quot;Country Life&quot; magazine. In books on railway station architecture, it was described by Steven Parissien as a &quot;depressing underground bunker&quot; and by Simon Jenkins as &quot;hideous&quot;.


====New Street signal box====

The power signal box at New Street was completed in 1964 on the site of the former turntable, housing the Westpac Geographical Interlocking &amp; Signalmens push button control panel (the largest relay interlocking in the world when installed) and also the Railway Telephone Exchange. It is a brutalist building with corrugated concrete architecture, designed by John Bicknell and Paul Hamilton in collaboration with William Robert Headley, the regional architect for British Railways London Midland Region. The eight-level structure with five main storeys, including track &amp; street levels and cable chamber below track level, is at the side of the tracks connected to Navigation Street. As of 2020, it is a Grade II-listed building. Until recently, two small sidings (nos. 2 &amp; 3 Engine Sidings) were located in front of the signal box which were used for stabling electric locomotives in connection with locomotive changes from diesel to electric traction on XC services heading north. As they are no longer needed, these have now been removed in connection with the ongoing resignalling project for the station area. No. 1 Engine Siding was located at the north end, between platforms 4 and 5, and was lengthened some years ago to form platform 4C.

====Don&#x27;s Miniature New Street====
A Sutton Coldfield model railway enthusiast, Don Jones, built a scale model of the entire 1960s station and surrounding buildings including the Rotunda, the old Head Post Office and the signal box, at OO scale; open days were held to raise funds for local charities. Private visits were held for Robert Redford and King Hussein of Jordan.

===2010–2015 redevelopment===
As a result of the problems with the existing station, proposals to redevelop the station gained traction in the mid-2000s. A feasibility study was approved in January 2005. Designs were shown to the public in February 2006 for a new Birmingham New Street Station, in a project known as Gateway Plus. A regeneration scheme was launched in 2006 and evolved through names such as Birmingham Gateway, Gateway Plus and New Street Gateway. The scheme proposed complete rebuilding of the street-level buildings and refurbishment of the platforms by 2013, with track and platform level remaining essentially unchanged.

The approved planning application of August 2006 showed a glass facade with rounded edges. The entrance on Station Street originally included two curved tall towers on the site of Stephenson Tower. Due to the economic slowdown, the &quot;twin towers&quot; plan was shelved.
In February 2008, the Secretary of State for Transport, Ruth Kelly, announced that the Department for Transport would provide £160 million in addition to £128 million through the government white paper &quot;Delivering a Sustainable Railway&quot;. A further £100 million came from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and channelled through Advantage West Midlands, the regional development agency. The announcement brought total government spending on the project to £388 million. After earlier proposals were discarded, six architects were shortlisted to design the new station following a call for submissions and it was announced, in September 2008, that the design by Foreign Office Architects had been chosen.
The approved plans for the redevelopment included:
*A new concourse three-and-a-half times larger than the 1960s concourse, with a domed atrium at the centre to let in natural light.
*Refurbished platforms reached by new escalators and lifts.
*A new station facade and new entrances.

The fact that the proposed Gateway development would leave the railway capacity of the station more or less unaltered has not escaped attention. In July 2008, the House of Commons Transport Committee criticised the plans; it was not convinced they were adequate for the number of trains which could use the station. It said if the station could not be adapted, then the government needed to look for alternative solutions which potentially included a completely new station in the city.

Work began on the redevelopment on 26 April 2010. Construction was completed in phases to minimise disruption. On 28 April 2013, one half of the new concourse was opened to the public and the old 1960s concourse was closed for redevelopment, along with the old entrances. The complete concourse opened on 20 September 2015, the Grand Central shopping centre four days later. The refurbished Pallasades Shopping Centre was renamed Grand Central and included a John Lewis department store. During heavy winds on 30 December 2015, several roof tiles blew off, landing in the adjacent Station Street, which was therefore closed by the police as a precautionary measure.
==Operations==
Around 80% of train services to Birmingham go through New Street. The other major city-centre stations in Birmingham are and . Outside Birmingham, in Solihull, is , which serves Birmingham Airport and the National Exhibition Centre.

===Railway operations===

New Street is the hub of the West Midlands rail network, as well as being a major national hub. The station is one of twenty operated and managed by Network Rail. Network Rail also provides operational staff for the station.

Station staff are provided on all platforms to assist with the safe dispatch of trains. For operational reasons, all trains departing New Street must be dispatched via the use of Right Away (RA) indicators. They display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.

The twelve through platforms are divided into &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the &quot;b&quot; end of the station towards Wolverhampton; this, in effect, allows twice the number of platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as Class 390 Pendolinos.

Trains departing towards Proof House Junction (&quot;a&quot; end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the &quot;b&quot; end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton; however, due to the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5–12 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; these are between platforms 5/6, 7/8 and 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 were removed during the 2015 refurbishment. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.

Still in existence, but out of use, is the &quot;Royal Mail tunnel&quot; which connected the &quot;b&quot; end of the station platforms to the former sorting office (now called The Mailbox) alongside Suffolk Street. The tunnel to the former Head Post Office at Victoria Square is bricked up, with the subway between the platforms remaining in use for railway staff. The former baggage subway at the &quot;a&quot; end is now used for railway staff and as a fire exit.

All signalling is controlled by West Midlands Signalling Centre in Saltley, with the former New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or &quot;b&quot; end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street. The station is allocated the IATA location identifier QQN.

====Approach tunnels====
All trains arriving and departing must use one of the several tunnels around the station.

*Stour Valley Line Tunnel – heads westwards towards Soho Junction &amp; Wolverhampton and passes under the National Indoor Arena. This tunnel is long in total, comprising the original New Street North Tunnel and extension: &#x27;Arena&#x27; Tunnel, . The former was opened in 1852, as part of the Stour Valley Line, and holds two tracks.
*New Street South Tunnel – long, heading eastbound, passing under the Bullring and station, heading towards Duddeston, Adderley Park, the Camp Hill line and the Derby lines towards Tamworth. This tunnel opened in 1854 and originally held two tracks; it was widened in 1896 to hold four tracks, with two double-track parallel bores.
*Gloucester Line Tunnels – a series of four consecutive, separate tunnels heading south-west towards Five Ways. Heading from New Street, in sequence, the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, long; Canal Tunnel, long, passing under the Birmingham Canal Navigations; Granville Street Tunnel, long; and Bath Row Tunnel, long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the Birmingham West Suburban Railway and hold two tracks.

===Customer service and ticketing===
Network Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by Avanti West Coast, with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and Network West Midlands also provides a public transport information point for the station.

The station is a penalty fare station for West Midlands Railway and London Northwestern Railway (West Midlands Trains&#x27; brands). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.

===Pollution and air quality concerns===
The station is designated as underground. There were extractor fans that removed fumes, but these were removed with the refurbishment of the concourse and shopping centre above the platforms. They were replaced with blowers, as there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station having been electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution, especially NOx, in the station.

===Train operating companies===
Since the privatisation of British Rail, thirteen train companies have regularly called at New Street: 
Arriva Trains Wales, Avanti West Coast, Central Trains, CrossCountry, First North Western, London Midland, Silverlink, Virgin CrossCountry, Virgin Trains West Coast, Transport for Wales, Wales &amp; Borders, Wales &amp; West and West Midlands Trains.

Currently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street:
Chiltern Railways has occasionally used New Street during engineering works.

West Midlands Trains operates a traincrew depot at the station and stables some trains overnight around the station. For the most part, it uses Soho TMD for electric traction units; its non-electric units are kept at Tyseley TMD to the south-east of Birmingham.

CrossCountry also operates a traincrew depot at the station; it uses Tyseley TMD for the Class 170 units and its Voyagers are based at Central Rivers TMD.

==Transport links==
===West Midlands Metro===

New Street is served by the West Midlands Metro tram system from the adjacent Grand Central tram stop outside the station&#x27;s main entrance on Stephenson Street. This opened on 30 May 2016, when the city centre extension of the Metro came into operation. The stop was temporarily, before extension to Broad Street, a terminus of West Midlands Metro Line One, and provides a link to Snow Hill station and onwards to Wolverhampton.

Initially, Grand Central was planned to act as the terminus of the city centre extension. However, it was later decided that further extension would take place towards Centenary Square and later to Edgbaston, this extension opened in mid 2022.

===Links to Moor Street and Snow Hill stations===
New Street station is away from ; the city&#x27;s second busiest railway station. There is a signposted route for passengers travelling between New Street and Moor Street stations which involves a short walk through a bus tunnel under the Bullring shopping centre. Although the railway lines into New Street pass directly underneath Moor Street station, there is no rail connection. In 2013 a new direct walkway was opened between the two stations. Birmingham Snow Hill station is away; it is either a ten-minute walk away to the north, or can be reached via a short tram ride on the West Midlands Metro.

==Accidents and incidents==

* On 7 November 1850, the engine of a goods train which was leaving the station was derailed by an explosion caused by leaking gas from a gas-lighting main, which came into contact with its firebox. There were no casualties, but the abutment of the viaduct on which the explosion occurred was destroyed by the blast.
* On 18 April 1877, the south tunnel was blocked by an overturned locomotive.
* On 26 November 1921, a serious accident occurred on the Midland half of New Street station, when an express from Bristol crashed into the rear of a stationary train to Derby, which was standing at platform four and had been delayed due to engine trouble. The collision caused the guards van of the Derby train to telescope with the rear coach. Three people were killed, and twenty four injured. The later inquest ruled that the express had overrun the danger signal due to driver error, and the misty conditions had made the rails moist, leading to wheelslip when the driver applied the brakes.

<text>The Iraq Museum () is the national museum of Iraq, located in Baghdad. It is sometimes informally called the National Museum of Iraq. The Iraq Museum contains precious relics from the Mesopotamian, Abbasid, and Persian civilizations. It was looted during and after the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Despite international efforts, only some of the stolen artifacts have been returned. After being closed for many years while being refurbished, and rarely open for public viewing, the museum was officially reopened in February 2015.

==Foundation==
After World War I, archaeologists from Europe and the United States began several excavations throughout Iraq. In an effort to keep those findings from leaving Iraq, Gertrude Bell (a British traveller, intelligence agent, archaeologist, and author) began collecting the artifacts in a government building in Baghdad in 1922. In 1926, the Iraqi government moved the collection to a new building and established the Baghdad Antiquities Museum, with Bell as its director. Bell died later that year; the new director was Sidney Smith.

In 1966, the collection was moved again, to a two-story, building in Baghdad&#x27;s Al-Ṣāliḥiyyah neighborhood in the Al-Karkh district on the east side of the Tigris River. It is with this move that the name of the museum was changed to the Iraq Museum. It was originally known as the Baghdad Archaeological Museum.

Bahija Khalil became the director of the Iraq Museum in 1983. She was the first woman director and she held that role until 1989.

==Collections==

Due to the archaeological riches of Mesopotamia, the museum&#x27;s collections are considered to be among the most important in the world, and it has a fine record of scholarship and display. The British connection with the museum — and with Iraq — has resulted in exhibits always being displayed bilingually, in both English and Arabic. It contains important artifacts from the over 5,000-year-long history of Mesopotamia in 28 galleries and vaults.

The collections of The Iraq Museum include art and artifacts from ancient Sumerian, Assyrian and Babylonian civilizations. The museum also has galleries devoted to collections of both pre-Islamic and Islamic Arabian art and artifacts. Of its many noteworthy collections, the Nimrud gold collection—which features gold jewelry and figures of the precious stone that date to the 9th-century BCE—and the collection of stone carvings and cuneiform tablets from Uruk are exceptional. The Uruk treasures date to between 3500 and 3000 BCE.

==Damage and losses during 2003 war==

In the months preceding the 2003 Iraq war, starting in December and January, various antiquities experts, including representatives from the American Council for Cultural Policy asked the Pentagon and the UK government to ensure the museum&#x27;s safety from both combat and looting, but no promises were made. U.S. forces did not bomb the site, despite them bombing a number of uninhabited Iraqi archaeological sites.

On April 9, 2003, the last of the museum curators and staff left the museum. Iraqi forces engaged U.S. forces a few blocks away, as well as the nearby Special Republican Guard compound. Lt. Col. Eric Schwartz of the U.S. third Infantry Division declared that he &quot;was unable to enter the compound and secure it since they attempted to avoid returning fire at the building. Sniper positions, discarded ammunition, and 15 Iraqi Army uniforms were later discovered in the building&quot;. The positions turned out to be museum arranged sandbags and protective foam support and mitigation barriers for large size artefacts, the uniforms and ammunition turning out to belong to the museum curators and staff (being reserve military personnel in state of war) and to the contrary to the U.S. statement, no traces of any serious engagement were detected anywhere in the museum and its surrounding yard. Iraqi staff as a protective measure had built a fortified wall along the western side of the compound, allowing concealed movement between the front and rear of the museum, and the U.S. forces could have secured the museum by simply encircling and isolating it preventing the looters from accessing the facility.

Thefts took place between April 10 and 12, and when a number of museum staff returned to the building on April 12, they fended off further attempts by looters to enter the museum and had to wait until April 16 for the deployment of the U.S. forces around the museum. A special team headed by Marine Col. Matthew Bogdanos initiated an investigation on April 21. His investigation indicated that there were three separate thefts by three distinct groups over the four days. While the staff instituted a storage plan to prevent theft and damage (also used during the Iran–Iraq War and the first Gulf War), many larger statues, steles, and friezes had been left in the public galleries, protected with foam and surrounded by sandbags. Forty pieces were stolen from these galleries, mostly the more valuable ones. Of these only 13 had been recovered as of January 2005, including the three most valuable: the Sacred Vase of Warka (though broken in fourteen pieces, which was the original state it was found in when first excavated), the Mask of Warka, and the Bassetki Statue.

According to museum officials, the looters concentrated on the heart of the exhibition: &quot;the Warka Vase, a Sumerian alabaster piece more than 5,000 years old; a bronze Uruk statue from the Akkadian period, also 5,000 years old, which weighs 660 pounds; and the headless statue of Entemena. The Harp of Ur was torn apart by looters who removed its gold inlay.&quot; Among the stolen artefacts is the bronze Bassetki Statue, a life-size statue of a young man, originally found in the village Basitke in the northern part of Iraq, an Akkadian Empire piece that goes back to 2300 B.C. and the stone statue of King Schalmanezer, from the eighth century BC.

In addition, the museum&#x27;s above-ground storage rooms were looted. Approximately 3,100 excavation site pieces (jars, vessels, pottery shards, etc.) were stolen, of which only 3,000 have been recovered. The thefts did not appear to be discriminating; for example, an entire shelf of fakes was stolen, while an adjacent shelf of much greater value was undisturbed.

The third occurrence of theft was in the underground storage rooms. The thieves attempted to steal the most easily transportable objects, which had been intentionally stored in the most remote location possible. Of the four rooms, the only portion disturbed was a single corner in the furthest room, where cabinets contained 100 small boxes containing cylinder seals, beads, and jewelry. Evidence indicated that the thieves possessed special master keys to the cabinets but dropped them in the dark. Instead, they stole 10,000 small objects that were lying in plastic boxes on the floor. Of them, only 2,500 have approximately been recovered.
One of the most valuable artifacts looted was a headless stone statue of the Sumerian king Entemena of Lagash. The Entemena statue, &quot;estimated to be 4,400 years old, is the first significant artifact returned all the way from the United States and by far the most important piece found outside Iraq. American officials declined to discuss how they recovered the statue.&quot; The statue of the king, located in the center of the museum&#x27;s second-floor Sumerian Hall, weighs hundreds of pounds, making it the heaviest piece stolen from the museum – the looters &quot;probably rolled or slid it down marble stairs to remove it, smashing the steps and damaging other artifacts.&quot;

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced the recovery of the statue of King Entemena of Lagash on July 25, 2006, in the United States again. The statue was returned to the Iraq government. It was discovered in the United States with the help of Hicham Aboutaam, an art dealer in New York.

===International reaction to the looting===
The U.S. government was criticised for doing nothing to protect the museum after occupying Baghdad. Dr Irving Finkel of the British Museum said the looting was &quot;entirely predictable and could easily have been stopped.&quot; Martin E. Sullivan, chairman of the U.S. president&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Cultural Property, and U.S. State Department cultural advisers Gary Vikan and Richard S. Lanier resigned in protest at the failure of US forces to prevent the looting.

The extent of the looting of The Iraq Museum has been disputed. Based on a miscommunication by the first crews on the scene, and the empty display cases in the main galleries that in most cases had held objects which museum curators had removed before the First Gulf War and invasion, news organizations for weeks reported that as much as 170,000 catalogued lots (501,000 pieces) had been looted. The accurate figure was around 15,000 items, including 5,000 extremely valuable cylinder seals.

On April 12, 2003, The Associated Press reported: &quot;The famed Iraq National Museum, home of extraordinary Babylonian, Sumerian and Assyrian collections and rare Islamic texts, sat empty Saturday – except for shattered glass display cases and cracked pottery bowls that littered the floor.&quot;

On April 14, National Public Radio&#x27;s Robert Siegel announced on All Things Considered: &quot;As it turned out, American troops were but a few hundred yards away as the country&#x27;s heritage was stripped bare.&quot;

Reacting to the loss, French President Jacques Chirac on April 16, 2003, declared the incident &quot;a crime against humanity.&quot;

When asked why the U.S. military did not try to guard the museum in the days after the invasion succeeded, Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said &quot;If you remember, when some of that looting was going on, people were being killed, people were being wounded ... It&#x27;s as much as anything else a matter of priorities.&quot; Civil Affairs expert William Sumner, who was tasked with handling arts, monuments and archives, explained that the postwar Civil Affairs planners &quot;didn&#x27;t foresee the marines as going out and assigning marine units as security ... The issue of archaeological sites was considered a targeting problem,&quot; to be dealt with by those flying bombing missions. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, speaking about the museum&#x27;s looting, said &quot;stuff happens&quot; and &quot;to try to pass off the fact of that unfortunate activity to a deficit in the war plan strikes me as a stretch,&quot; and described the period of looting in general as &quot;untidiness.&quot; Secretary of State Colin Powell said, &quot;The United States understands its obligations and will be taking a leading role with respect to antiquities in general but this museum in particular,&quot; but all such promises were only partially honoured considering the staggering increase in Iraqi archaeological site looting during the U.S. occupation period of Iraq.

Two weeks after the museum thefts, Dr. Donny George Youkhanna, General Director Research Studies for the Board of Antiquities in Iraq, stated of the looting, &quot;It&#x27;s the crime of the century because it affects the heritage of all mankind.&quot; After the U.S. Marines set up headquarters in Baghdad&#x27;s Palestine Hotel, Dr Youkhanna confirmed that he personally went there to plead for troops to protect the museum&#x27;s onsite collection, but no guards were sent for another three days.

===Attempts to recover lost items===

A few days later, agents of the FBI were sent to Iraq to search for stolen Museum property. UNESCO organized an emergency meeting of antiquities experts on April 17, 2003, in Paris to deal with the aftermath of the looting and its effects on the global art and antiquities market.

On April 18, 2003, the Baghdad Museum Project was formed in the United States with a proposal to assure the Iraq Museum every possibility of the eventual safe return of its collection, even if that is to take hundreds of years. Rather than focus only on law enforcement and the current antiquities market, the group set its mission as being to (1) establish a comprehensive online catalog of all cultural artifacts in the museum&#x27;s collection, (2) create a virtual Baghdad Museum that is accessible to the general public over the Internet, (3) build a 3D collaborative workspace within the virtual Baghdad Museum for design and fundraising purposes, and (4) establish a resource center within the virtual Baghdad Museum for community cultural development. Various ancient items believed looted from the museum have surfaced in neighboring countries on their way to the United States, Israel, Europe, Switzerland, and Japan, and even on eBay.

On May 7, 2003, U.S. officials announced that nearly 40,000 manuscripts and 700 artifacts belonging to the Iraq Museum in Baghdad were recovered by U.S. Customs agents working with museum experts in Iraq. Some looters had returned items after promises of rewards and amnesty, and many items previously reported missing had actually been hidden in secret storage vaults prior to the outbreak of war. On June 7, 2003, the U.S. occupation authorities announced that world-famous treasures of Nimrud were preserved in a secret vault in the Iraqi Central Bank. The artifacts included necklaces, plates, gold earrings, finger and toe rings, bowls and flasks. But, around 15,000 and the tiny items including some of the most valuable artifacts on the antiquities markets remain missing.

The museum has been protected since its looting, but archaeological sites in Iraq were left almost entirely unprotected by coalition forces, and there has been massive looting, starting from the early days of the warfare and between summer 2003 and the end of 2007. Estimates are that 400–600,000 artifacts have been plundered. Iraqi sculptor Mohammed Ghani Hikmat spearheaded efforts by the Iraqi artist community to recover artworks looted from the museum. Approximately 150 of Hikmat&#x27;s pieces were stolen from the museum alone. Hikmat&#x27;s group has only recovered approximately 100 of the museum&#x27;s works, as of September 2011.

United States Marine Colonel, and Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bogdanos led the search for these stolen artifacts for over five years from 2003. Up to the year 2006 approximately 10,000 artifacts were recovered through his efforts. Antiquities recovered include the Warka Vase and the Mask of Warka.

The Oriental Institute (Chicago) took the very first and most outstanding initiative to inform the rest of the world about the ransacking of the Iraqi Museum&#x27;s collection during the US-led invasion of Iraq. The institute set up a new webpage (named Lost Treasures from Iraq) on its website on April 15, 2003, just a few days after this plundering, sending a worldwide message about the lost, stolen, or probably “status unknown” artifacts. In addition, the website created a mass mailing list (“IraqiCrisis”) about the lost items from the Iraq Museum. However, the pertinent webpage about the looted Mesopotamian artifacts from the Iraq Museum was last updated on April 10, 2008, and then archived. The website seems to not update its information after then. Gradually, many artifacts which were labeled by the Lost Treasure from Iraq website as stolen or status unknown were found to be on display at museums inside Iraq for several years before the US-led invasion of Iraq. In addition, many others were still safe at the Iraq Museum and were not pillaged. This reflects prominent miscommunication and/or disconnection between the pertinent bodies responsible for the storage, registration, and display of these artifacts. As of December 16, 2022, the databases of the Iraq Museum on the Lost Treasures from Iraq appear not to be updated after April 14, 2008, to correct this.

==Recent work==
At various Iraq reconstruction conferences, the Baghdad Museum Project gave presentations to the reconstruction community advocating the preservation of Iraq&#x27;s cultural heritage in rebuilding projects. On August 27, 2006, Iraq&#x27;s museum director Dr. Donny Youkhanna fled the country to Syria, as a result of murder threats he and his family members had received from terrorist groups that were assassinating all remaining Iraqi intellectuals and scientists. Youkhanna held the position of visiting professor in the anthropology department of Stony Brook State University of New York until his death in March 2011.

On June 9, 2009, the treasures of the Iraq Museum went online for the first time as Italy inaugurated the Virtual Museum of Iraq . On November 24, 2009, Google announced that it would create a virtual copy of the museum&#x27;s collections at its own expense, and make images of four millennia of archaeological treasures available online, free, by early 2010. It is unclear the extent by which Google&#x27;s effort overlaps with Italy&#x27;s previous initiative. Google&#x27;s Street View service was used to image much of the museum&#x27;s exhibit areas and, as of November 2011, these images are online.

In 2017, forty ancient Iraqi artefacts drawn from the Iraq Museum and spanning six millennia, from the Neolithic Age to the Parthian Period, were shown alongside contemporary artworks at the Venice Biennale. Most of these objects had never previously left Iraq, excluding a few that were recently recovered after the 2003 lootings of the museum. Commissioned by Ruya Foundation, the exhibition &#x27;Archaic&#x27; attracted over 5,500 visitors during the preview week of the 57th Biennale, and was critically acclaimed by the press.

==Reopening==
The museum opened its doors only sporadically between September 1980, during the Iran-Iraq War, and 2015. After the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq, the museum was rarely opened, including an opening on July 3, 2003, for several hours for a visit by journalists and Coalition Provisional Authority head Paul Bremer, as a signal that things were returning to normal. In December 2008, the museum was opened for a photo opportunity for Ahmad Chalabi, who returned a number of artifacts supposedly handed in to him by Iraqis. On February 23, 2009, the museum was opened at the behest of Iraqi prime minister Maliki, to demonstrate that things were returning to normal. Many archaeological officials protested against this opening, arguing that conditions were not yet safe enough to put the museum at risk; the museum&#x27;s director was fired for airing her objections.

In a ceremony to mark the occasion, Qahtan Abbas, Iraq&#x27;s tourism and antiquities minister, said that only 6,000 of the 15,000 items looted from the museum in 2003 had been returned. And an estimated 600,000 archaeological pieces were looted by groups and militias allied with the United States since 2003, according to a book published in 2009. In September 2011 Iraqi officials announced the renovated museum will permanently reopen in November, protected by new climate control and security systems. The United States and Italian governments have both contributed to the renovation effort.

=== Official reopening ===
On February 28, 2015, the museum was officially reopened by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. The museum also has items taken from the Mosul Museum, as ISIS has taken it over.

==Recovery==
On September 7, 2010, the Associated Press reported that 540 looted treasures were returned to Iraq.

638 stolen artifacts were returned to the Iraq Museum after they were located in the office of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.

On January 30, 2012, a 6,500-year-old Sumerian gold jar, the head of a Sumerian battle axe and a stone from an Assyrian palace were among 45 relics returned to Iraq by Germany. Up to 10,000 of the Iraq Museum pieces are still missing, said Amira Eidan, general director of the museum at the time of the recovery.

On August 3, 2021, multiple global news sites reported that the US has returned 17,000 looted ancient artifacts to Iraq.

On March 8, 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation returned an ivory and gold leaf furniture piece dating back 7,500 years ago. It was previously on display at the Michael C. Carlos Museum. The museum purchased the artifact in 2006; its provenance records claimed it had previously been bought to the United States in 1969. After FBI agents determined that the records were falsified, the museum handed the artifact over to the FBI in December 2022. The FBI states that this is the first time an artifact looted from the Iraq Museum has been found in the possession of an American museum.

<doc id="209855" wikidata="Q2569107" url="?curid=209855" title="Towcester">
<text>Towcester ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the West Northamptonshire unitary authority area of Northamptonshire, England. From 1974 to 2021, it was the administrative centre of the South Northamptonshire district.

Towcester is one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in the country. It was the Roman town of Lactodurum, located on Watling Street, today’s A5. In Saxon times, this was the frontier between the kingdom of Wessex and the Danelaw. Towcester features in Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; as one of Mr Pickwick&#x27;s stopping places on his tour. The local racecourse has hosted many national horseracing events.

==Etymology==
Towcester comes from the Old English &quot;Tōfeceaster&quot;. &quot;Tōfe&quot; refers to the River Tove; Bosworth and Toller compare it to the &quot;Scandinavian proper names&quot; &quot;Tófi&quot; and &quot;Tófa&quot;. The Old English &quot;ceaster&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;castra&quot; (&quot;camp&quot;) and was &quot;often applied to places in Britain which had been Roman encampments.&quot; Thus, Towcester means &quot;Camp on the (river) Tove.&quot;

==History==

===Prehistoric and Roman periods===

Towcester lays claim to being the oldest town in Northamptonshire and possibly, because of the antiquity of recent Iron Age finds in the town, to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in the country. There is evidence that it was settled by humans since the Mesolithic era (middle stone age). There is also evidence of Iron Age burials in the area.

In Roman Britain, Watling Street, now the A5 road, was built through the area and a garrison town called &quot;Lactodurum&quot; established on the site of the present-day town. Two candidate sites for the Battle of Watling Street, fought in 61AD, are located close to the town, these are Church Stowe which is located to the north and Paulerspury which is to the south. A stone female head, that mixes Celtic and Roman styles, was found on Watling Street outside the town and was given to the British Museum in 1903.

===Saxon period and Medieval age===
When the Romans left in the 5th century, the area was settled by Saxons. In the 9th century, Watling Street became the frontier between the kingdom of Wessex and the Danelaw, and thus Towcester became a frontier town. Edward the Elder fortified Towcester in 917. In the 11th century, the Normans built a motte-and-bailey castle on the site. Bury Mount is the remains of the fortification and is a scheduled ancient monument. It was renovated in 2008 with an access ramp and explanatory plaques added.

===Georgian and Victorian periods===
In the 18th and early 19th centuries, in the heyday of the stagecoach and the mail coach, Watling Street became a major coaching road between London and Holyhead, and Towcester flourished, becoming a major stopping point. Many coaching inns and stabling facilities were provided for travellers in Towcester, many of which remain.

The coaching trade came to an abrupt halt in September 1838 when the London and Birmingham Railway was opened, which bypassed Towcester and passed through Blisworth; four miles away but enough to result in Towcester quickly reverting to being a quiet market town. By 1866 however, Towcester was linked to the national rail network by the first of several routes which came together to form the Stratford and Midland Junction Railway. Eventually, from Towcester railway station it was possible to travel four different ways out of the town: to Blisworth (opened May 1866); to Banbury (opened June 1872); to Stratford-upon-Avon (opened July 1873); and finally Olney (for access to Bedford, opened December 1892). The latter line however was an early casualty, closing to passengers in March 1893 although it continued to be used by race specials up until the outbreak of the Second World War. The Banbury line closed to passengers in July 1951 and the rest in April 1952. Goods traffic lingered on until final axing in February 1964 as part of the Beeching cuts. The site of Towcester railway station is now a Tesco supermarket.

Towcester might have gained a second station on a branch line of the Great Central Railway from its main line at Brackley to Northampton, but this branch was never built.

===20th century and beyond===

During the Second World War, Towcester received many evacuees from London as the Government felt the town was far enough away from any major settlements that could be a target. The town escaped any major aerial attacks but was bombed on two occasions, firstly by a plane that dropped its last six bombs following an attack on nearby Rugby. A few months later a German bomber dropped twelve bombs on the town during a &quot;drop and run&quot; attack.

The motor age brought new life to the town. Although now bypassed by the A43, the A5 trunk traffic still passes directly through the historic market town centre causing traffic jams at some times of the day. The resulting pollution has led to the town centre being designated an air quality management area. An A5 north-south bypass with plans for expansion of the town was being planned by the West Northamptonshire Development Corporation in 2007. A scheme to build a bypass for the A5 was submitted in 2020 and expected to cost up to £38 million. As of 2023 a relief road to the south linking the A5 to the A43 is under construction, and traffic calming measures will be implemented in the town centre while avoiding potential damage to the ancient Roman road.

The population was 2,743 at the time of the 1961 Census and this had grown to 9,252 by the 2011 census – a growth rate of about 3% per year. It has since rapidly expanded and there are plans to expand still further with another 3,300 houses equating to an appx 8,250 increase in population. Improvements to the links to the A43 and Watling Street roundabout took place in the first half of 2015 and including traffic light controls.

==Location==
The town is approximately south-west of Northampton and about north-west of Milton Keynes, the nearest main towns. Oxford is about south-west via the A43 road, M40 motorway and A34 road. The A43 now bypasses the town to the north but the A5 road still passes through the town centre. This still carries much traffic in the north-south direction. This is expected to change soon with a new A5 to A43 link bypassing the town to the south, expected to be completed by 2025.

Northampton railway station is the nearest railway station, being away from the town. Buses to Northampton, Milton Keynes, Brackley, Potterspury, Deanshanger, Silverstone and Biddlesden operate, but these are infrequent.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Towcester, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Towcester Town Council and West Northamptonshire Council. The town council is based at Towcester Town Hall on Watling Street, overlooking the town&#x27;s main square, which was built in 1865.

Towcester was an ancient parish. When elected parish and district councils were established in 1894 it was given a parish council and included in the Towcester Rural District. Towcester Rural District Council initially met at the workhouse on Brackley Road, but bought the previously privately-owned Town Hall in 1935 to serve as its headquarters.
The rural district council was abolished in 1974 and replaced with the larger South Northamptonshire District Council. The district council chose to base itself in Towcester, initially using the Town Hall as its headquarters. The district council moved to a new building at the junction of Springfields and Brackley Road in 1983, which in turn was replaced by another new building called The Forum on Moat Lane in 2015. South Northamptonshire District Council and Northamptonshire County Council were both abolished in 2021 and their functions passed to the new West Northamptonshire Council, which has its main offices in Northampton, but retains The Forum as an area office.

The parish council took over the Town Hall after the district council vacated it in 1983. In 1986 the parish council formally declared the parish to be a town, allowing the council to adopt the name Towcester Town Council.

Since the 2010 general election Towcester has been part of the South Northamptonshire constituency. Prior to that it was in the Daventry constituency.

==Facilities and notable sites==

Saint Lawrence&#x27;s C of E Church stands in the middle of the town. It has a 12th-century Norman transitional ground plan and foundation, probably laid over a Saxon 10th-century stone building. Its ecclesiastical heritage may well relate back to Roman times as St Lawrence was patron saint of the Roman legions. The building was reconstructed in the Perpendicular style 1480–85 when the church tower was added. The tower contains 12 bells generally accepted by ringers across the country to be one of the finest sets in the Midlands. The bells were moved in 1994 from Todmorden in Yorkshire. Permission to quarry stone for this restoration from Whittlewood Forest was granted by Edward IV and later confirmed by Richard III on his way towards Leicestershire and his death at the Battle of Bosworth Field. The church contains a &quot;Treacle&quot; Bible, a table tomb and cadaver of Archdeacon Sponne, Rector 1422–1448. The Archdeacon started the second oldest grammar school in Northamptonshire but the oldest one in the United Kingdom, which was merged with the old secondary modern school in Towcester to produce Sponne School. It is also claimed that Pope Boniface VIII was a rector of the church before his elevation to the position of pope. The church tower contains a peal of 12 bells and a chime of 9 bells.

Towcester Mill in Chantry Lane was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, but the oldest extant part of the building is just over two hundred years old. The mill&#x27;s working gear was powered by water, and was used to grind corn into flour and to mix animal feed, and is believed to be the only water mill in Northamptonshire with a working turbine.

Just outside the town in Slapton are The Slapton Wall Paintings, a noted collection of 14th and 15th century wall paintings, in the Church of St Botolph. 

The town has an Air Cadet squadron, 1875 (Towcester) Sqn ATC located near to Sponne School and the 1st Towcester scouts and guides group.

The Towcester Museum has exhibits tracing the community&#x27;s prehistory and history. The town has a wetland park, two pocket parks and a main park, The Recreation Ground, which is known locally as “The Rec”.

==Local media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter. BBC South and ITV Meridian can also be received from the Oxford TV transmitter. The town&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Northampton, Heart East, NLive Radio and Connect Radio. Local newspapers that cover the town are Northampton Herald &amp; Post and Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo.

==Sport==
Towcester Racecourse, originally part of the Easton Neston estate, is located on the east side of the town. Many national horse racing events were held there, as well as greyhound racing.

In 2010 the World Hovercraft Championship was held on the racecourse. The town&#x27;s rugby union club, Towcestrians R.F.C., play in the London &amp; South East Premier League. Towcester&#x27;s cycling club, the A5 Rangers, was founded in 1948.

Towcester is just 5 miles away from motor racing circuit Silverstone Circuit.

==Twin towns==
Towcester is twinned with Zhydachiv, Lviv Oblast, Ukraine.

<doc id="209861" wikidata="Q278573" url="?curid=209861" title="A. Bertram Chandler">
<text>Arthur Bertram Chandler (28 March 1912 in Aldershot, Hampshire, England – 6 June 1984 in Sydney, Australia) was an Anglo-Australian merchant marine officer, sailing the world in everything from tramp steamers to troop ships, but who later turned his hand to a second career as a prolific author of pulp science fiction. He also wrote under the pseudonyms of George Whitley, Andrew Dunstan and S.H.M. Many of his short stories draw on his extensive sailing background. In 1956, he emigrated to Australia and became an Australian citizen. By 1958 he was an officer on the Sydney–Hobart route. Chandler commanded various ships in the Australian and New Zealand merchant navies, including his service as the last master of the Australian aircraft carrier HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot;; by law, the ship was required to have an officer on board while awaiting its towing to China to be broken up. Chandler wrote over 40 novels and 200 works of short fiction, winning the Australian Ditmar Awards for the short story &quot;The Bitter Pill&quot; (in 1971) and for three novels: &quot;False Fatherland&quot; (in 1969), &quot;The Bitter Pill&quot; (in 1975), and &quot;The Big Black Mark&quot; (in 1976). One of Chandler&#x27;s daughters, Jenny Chandler, married British horror fiction writer Ramsey Campbell. His other children were Penelope Anne Chandler and Christopher John Chandler.

==Writings==


Chandler&#x27;s descriptions of life aboard spaceships and the relationships between members of the crew &quot;en route&quot; derive from his experience aboard seagoing ships, imparting a distinct sense of realism. He was most well known for his &quot;Rim World&quot; series and &quot;John Grimes&quot; novels, both of which have a distinctly naval flavour. In the latter, Chandler&#x27;s principal hero, John Grimes, is an enthusiastic sailor who has occasional adventures on the oceans of various planets. The books make repeated reference to an obsolete type of magnetically powered spaceship known as the &quot;Gaussjammer&quot;, remembered nostalgically by &quot;old timers&quot; – clearly modelled on the windjammer. The heyday of the Gaussjammer, some centuries earlier than the Rim Worlds books, is the setting of the less well-known &quot;The Deep Reaches of Space&quot; (1964) which has undisguised autobiographical elements: its protagonist is a sailor turned science-fiction writer who travels to the future and uses his nautical experience to save a party of humans stranded on an alien planet.

Chandler arrived at the John Grimes series in a rather roundabout way. His original Rim Worlds protagonist was merchant spaceman Derek Calver, who drifted from the galactic centre to the Rim (as Chandler himself had migrated from the U.K. to Australia). In &quot;The Rim of Space&quot; and &quot;The Ship from Outside&quot;, Calver&#x27;s adventures around the Rim included becoming a ship&#x27;s captain and meeting and marrying Jane &quot;Calamity&quot; Arlen – like him, a refugee from the galactic centre.

Then appeared Sonia Verril, a femme fatale who tempted Calver, nearly ruining his marriage. With this incipient love triangle moving towards a confrontation in deep space, the grumpy John Grimes was introduced as a secondary character very much in the background. Eventually, however, Calver and his wife, Arlen, board the Outsiders&#x27; ship and depart from the galaxy and out of all human ken, leaving the stage empty for Verril and Grimes to join in an adventure &quot;Into the Alternate Universe&quot;, culminating in their marriage, with Grimes thenceforth becoming Chandler&#x27;s primary character. Chandler provided Grimes with numerous new adventures, as well as charting his career backwards to its humble beginnings, much in the same way as C. S. Forester&#x27;s fictional naval hero Horatio Hornblower, who in some ways served as a model for the John Grimes character, was first introduced as a captain before his career was sketched backwards to his time as a midshipman.

Chandler&#x27;s Australian background is evident in his depiction of a future wherein Australia becomes a major world power and Australians take the lead in space exploration and in colonising other planets. Drongo Kane, a pirate captain who is the villain in several books, comes from the planet Austral, and other books mention the planet Australis in another part of the galaxy. His story &quot;The Mountain Movers,&quot; part of Grimes&#x27;s early career, includes a song for future Australian space adventurers, sung to the tune of &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;, with the first stanza running:

::&quot;When the jolly Jumbuk lifted from Port Woomera&quot;
:::&quot;Out and away for Altair Three,&quot;
::&quot;Glad were we all to kiss the tired old Earth goodbye;&quot;
:::&quot;Who&#x27;ll come a-sailing in Jumbuk with me?&quot;

The colonists who sing the song end up re-enacting the darker part of Australian history, even dispossessing the natives of the planet Olgana – humanoids who resemble the Indigenous Australians. As revealed at the climax of the story, the resemblance is not accidental. In his novel &quot;Kelly Country&quot; (1984) Chandler explored an alternate history in which the bushranger Ned Kelly was not captured and hanged, but led a rebellion, ultimately becoming the president of an Australian republic which degenerated into a hereditary dictatorship.

Chandler made heavy use of the parallel universe plot device throughout his career, with many Grimes stories involving characters briefly crossing over into other realities. In &quot;The Dark Dimensions&quot;, which is set at a point in space where various realities meet, Grimes (the Rim World commodore), meets a second John Grimes who is still in the Federation Survey Service, as well as characters from the Empress Irene books and Poul Anderson&#x27;s Dominic Flandry.

In his ironic short story &quot;The Cage&quot;, a band of shipwrecked humans wandering naked in the jungles of a faraway planet are captured by aliens and placed in a zoo, where, failing in all their efforts to convince their captors that they are intelligent, some are dissected. Eventually they become resigned to captivity and adopt a small local rodent as a pet, placing him in a wicker cage. Seeing this, their captors apologise for the mistake and repatriate them to Earth, remarking that &quot;only intelligent creatures put other creatures in cages&quot;.

Sex is frequent in Chandler&#x27;s books, often in free fall. Women on board are usually stereotyped in roles of pursers or passengers; seldom are they regular officers in the chain of command. Chandler&#x27;s protagonists are quite prone to affairs and promiscuous behaviour, but are also shown falling in love and undertaking long-lasting, harmonious marriages; e.g., Sonia Verril served as an officer before marrying Grimes. Relationships are invariably described from the male point of view; whilst women characters might be sympathetic, they are always seen from the outside. In the early &quot;Bring Back Yesterday&quot; (1961), the dashing Johnnie Petersen is involved with four women in the course of a single book, whose plot lasts no more than a few weeks. Of them, one is inconsiderate and hurts him deeply; one is kindly and motherly, but Petersen is not physically attracted to her; one is a short chance encounter which soon ends with no lasting positive or negative trace; and the last is the one and only great love of his life. Petersen changes time itself in order to save her from a gruesome death and lives happily ever after with her.
