<text>Furby is an American electronic robotic toy by Tiger Electronics. Originally released in 1998, it resembles a hamster or owl-like creature and went through a period of being a &quot;must-have&quot; toy following its holiday season launch. Over 40 million Furbies were sold during the three years of its original production, with 1.8 million sold in 1998, and 14 million in 1999. Its speaking capabilities were translated into 14 languages.

Furbies were the first successful attempt to produce and sell a domestically aimed robot. A newly purchased Furby, or a Furby that has been reset, starts out speaking entirely &quot;Furbish,&quot; the unique language that all Furbies speak, but is programmed to start speaking English words and phrases in place of Furbish over time. This process is intended to resemble the process of learning English.

The updated Emoto-Tronic Furby, with voice recognition and more complex facial movements, was sold by Hasbro between 2005 and 2007. Furby with black and white LCD eyes and a mobile app was released for the holiday season in 2012. Another updated Furby with color LCD eyes, known as Furby Connect was released in 2016. The last new generation was released in 2023.

==History==
===Initial creation===
Dave Hampton and Caleb Chung spent nine months creating the Furby (in addition to nine months spent designing the toy). After two attempts at licensing the concept, they invited fellow toy and game inventor Richard C. Levy to join their efforts to sell Furby. Levy brought Furby to Tiger Electronics and Tiger&#x27;s Roger Shiffman bought the rights to it. Furby&#x27;s first public appearance was at the American International Toy Fair in 1998.

Furbies originally retailed for about US$35, and upon release, they sold very well. Catapulting demand during the 1998 Christmas period drove the resale price over $100, and sometimes as high as several hundred dollars. Furbies were sold for over $300 in newspapers and in auctions. Nicknames were given to the different aesthetic varieties, and sellers assigned rarity values to them.

The significant aftermarket demand (and price) for the toy resulted in cases of fraud in which customers paid for Furbies that were never delivered. As supplies dwindled, and when retail supplies ran out, buyers turned to the Internet, where Furbies could be purchased for two, three, or more multiples of their retail price. During one 12-month period, a total of 27 million Furby toys were sold.

===Revivals===
2005 saw the reintroduction of Furby with the release of the new Emoto-Tronic Furby.

On April 12, 2012, it was announced that Hasbro would be making a new line of Furbies. The new line was released in September 2012. As of December 2012 there were sixteen colors: teal, white, black, purple, tangerine-tango, yellow, aqua, navy blue, plum, pink, pink/teal, orange/blue, black/pink, blue/yellow, teal/purple, and gray/teal.
Furbies were one of the eleven toys named the top toys for Christmas 2013 by the Toy Retailers Association at the DreamToys Convention where they unveil their predictions for the most popular holiday toys annually.

==Types==
===First generation (1998–2002)===
The main reason for their popularity was because of apparent &quot;intelligence&quot;, reflected in their ability to develop language skills.

Furbies can communicate with one another via an infrared port located between their eyes. Furbies start out speaking entirely &quot;Furbish&quot;, a language with short words, simple syllables, and various other sounds. They are programmed, however, to speak less and less Furbish and more and more English as they &quot;grow&quot;. According to the variant, it knew 9 languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Japanese, Swedish, Greek and Portuguese).

There was a common misconception that they repeated words that were said around them. This belief most likely stemmed from the fact that it is possible to have the Furby say certain pre-programmed words or phrases more often by petting it whenever it said these words. As a result of this myth, several intelligence agencies banned them from their offices.

A simple electric motor and a system of cams and gears close the Furby&#x27;s eyes and mouth, raise its ears, and lift it off the ground in a faux display of mobility.

The originals are popular with many hackers as they can be dissected and made to do interesting things. In particular, their advanced audio capabilities and various sensory interfaces make them popular with the circuit bending community.

McDonald&#x27;s Happy Meal toy Furby-Shelby was released in 2000 in the United Kingdom, there are 8 to collect in total (4 classic look and 4 clams). These toys can sing to each other via a sensor in their feet.

====Furby Babies====
In 1999, the Furby Babies line was introduced. Furby Babies are smaller than the original, have higher voices, and cannot dance, but they switch to speaking English more quickly. They also have an extended vocabulary and different &quot;Easter eggs&quot; and &quot;games&quot; built into them. Furby Babies come in 24 different colors. All have white eyelashes and one of six different eyecolors.

====Furby Friends====
Novel Furbies were also released, including an interactive Furby-style &quot;Gizmo&quot;, from the film &quot;Gremlins&quot;, a Furby-style &quot;Interactive Yoda&quot; based on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; character, and a Furby-style &quot;Interactive E.T.&quot; from the movie of the same name. Another &quot;friend of Furby&quot;, called &quot;Shelby&quot;, is similar to Furby, but looks like a clam, has vast improvements in memory, and has a different personality; it was released in 2001 and can communicate with the original Furbies and Furby Babies. They also have sensors that can sense loud sounds, can sense being upside down (they say things like &quot;Shiver me timbers&quot; and &quot;Walk the plank&quot; when left upside-down for an extended period of time), and they laugh when &quot;tickled&quot; (their antennae – or &quot;tennies&quot;, as they like to call them). They also purr when &quot;petted&quot;. They can be fed by sticking a finger in their mouth. Similarly, Shelbies do not have their own names, unlike the classic Furbies. Shelbies are also capable of knowing if it is talking to a Furby or another Shelby, saying phrases such as &quot;Where&#x27;s Furby?&quot;—though they cannot differentiate between a Furby and a Furby Baby—they just assume it is a Furby. In addition to English, Shelbies also know some Furbish words and also have their own unique language called &quot;Shelbish&quot;.

===Second generation (2005–2007)===
Emoto-Tronic Furbies were released in August 2005. Larger than the previous version, the new Furbies have been upgraded with a more emotional face and a voice recognition system, enabling them to communicate with humans. Unlike the Furbies originally released, just one order is necessary to make them &#x27;sleep&#x27;, and they have an on/off switch. They can communicate with other Emoto-tronic Furbies, though to a lesser extent than the communication between original Furbies, and they cannot themselves communicate with the original Furbies nor Funky Furbies. They also lack light sensors and basic motion sensors and do not respond to loud sounds as the originals do. These Furbies, according to the story they come packed with, are from Furby Island. It knew only seven languages (Swedish and Greek disappeared).

====Emoto-Tronic Furby Babies====
In 2006, a new version of Furby Baby was released, with the most notable features being the new look and a more &quot;babyish&quot; appearance in contrast to the Emoto-Tronic Furby adult. They also have considerably fewer features than the &quot;adult&quot; Furby, with a very limited vocabulary and a lower level of interactivity. Another notable feature of the 2006 Emoto-Tronic Baby Furby is the movable &quot;legs&quot; which unfurl when a Furby Baby is awake. Although they were a European exclusive, they were sold in the US via the Hasbro Toy Shop website.

====Emoto-Tronic Funky Furbies====
The Funky Furbies were released in August 2006 outside the United States. They have three color combinations (pink and yellow; purple and green; blue and purple), they can sing three new songs and dance. They can be taught dance routines and remember them.

===Third generation (2012–2015)===

A new Furby was released in the fall of 2012. It has new monochromatic LCD eyes, a wider range of motions and the ability to adapt its personality in reaction to user behavior. Compared to the first generation, variants with Russian, Chinese, Mandarin, Korean and Polish were also produced, increasing the number of languages to 14. The on-off switch is replaced with a reset button; the Furby turns itself off after one minute of inactivity. It had its own iOS and Android app &quot;Furby&quot;, it communicated with one&#x27;s Furby via high pitched sound. The application was however later removed from mobile app stores.

====Furby Party Rockers====
A series of toys called Furby Party Rockers was released in addition to the 2012 Furbies. Those feature pre-programmed personalities that differ between the various models.

Instead of the screens that the full-size Furbies feature, their eyes are made out of transparent plastic with a backing that has a static pattern printed. The eyes have an LED backlight and the printed image is stereoscopic so that it changes depending on the viewing angle. The Party Rockers do not have any moving parts.

====Furby Boom====
In summer of 2013, about a year after the 2012 Furby came out, a new Furby was released with new different colors and new Personalities. It had new iOS and Android app, called &quot;Furby BOOM!&quot;, with many new features, the app was however later removed from mobile app stores.

====Furblings (toy version)====
In June 2014, a toy version of the Furblings from the Furby BOOM! app was released along with a golden limited time one. It can communicate with Furby Booms, and can be used with the app.

====Furby Boom Crystal====
The release for Christmas 2014 was called the Furby Boom Crystal series, with a redesign of the ears, face and feet and new bright neon fur. The iOS and Android apps were also redesigned.

====Furby Boom Crystal Furblings====
In early 2015, a toy version of the Furby Boom Crystal Furblings from the app was released. Like the other Furblings, it can communicate with Furby Boom Crystals, and be used with the app.

====Furbacca====
In June 2015, a Furby that resembles Chewbacca from Star Wars was released. It is similar to the Furby Boom because it can hatch Furblings with the same app and more.

===Fourth generation (2016–2017)===
In 2016, new Furby Connect with color LCD eyes and more expressive movements was released. The Furby Connect has a translucent plastic joystick on its head which lights up different colors when toggled and is used to control games played with Furblings in the app. Unlike the 2012 Furby and Furby Boom, the Furby Connect does not change personalities. It can sing songs that it &quot;learns&quot; from the app. It had an app &quot;Furby Connect World&quot; containing a whole world of Furblings for it to interact with, the app was however removed from mobile app stores in 2021. It knew only two languages, English or Russian.

===Fifth generation (2023–present)===
On June 22, 2023, Hasbro announced the return of the Furby line with &quot;5 voice activated modes&quot;, and &quot;over 600 responses&quot;. It comes in three varieties: purple, coral, and special edition tye-dye (only France, Great Britain and Ireland.) Unlike Furby Connect and Furby Boom they cannot connect to an app, and instead of LCD eyes, only have drawn eyes. The new Furby has glowing ears, responds to petting, shaking, and feeding, and also comes with bundled accessories (necklace with beads and comb). It knows English, Spanish, German, Italian, French or Polish.

====Furblets====
On December 1, 2023, Hasbro introduced Furblets. This is a smaller Furby with no moving parts, apart from ears which can only be moved manually.

==Technology==
The original Furby source code was written in assembly language for the 6502 microprocessor.

The first Furby model was based around a 6502-style Sunplus SPC81A microcontroller, which had 80 KiB of ROM and 128 bytes of RAM. Its core differed from the original 6502 in the lack of the Y index register.
The TSP50C04 chip from Texas Instruments, implementing the linear predictive coding codec, was used for voice synthesis.

==Security concerns==
On January 13, 1999, it was reported the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States banned Furbies from entering NSA&#x27;s property due to concerns that they may be used to record and repeat classified information, advising those that see any on NSA property to &quot;contact their Staff Security Officer for guidance.&quot; It was thought within the NSA that Furbies had an artificial intelligence chip that could &quot;learn&quot; from things the user said. The NSA theorized that if employees discussed confidential information around the toys, that information could later be repeated at a later date.

Roger Shiffman, the owner of Tiger Electronics, stated that &quot;Furby has absolutely no ability to do any recording whatsoever,&quot; and that he would have gladly told the NSA this if he was asked by anyone from the spy agency. Additionally, Dave Hampton demonstrated that Furby&#x27;s microphone can not record any sound at all, and can only hear a single monotonous beep if a loud sound is produced around Furby, and no words or waveforms can be made out at all. The ban was eventually withdrawn.

In 2017, it has been confirmed that Furby Connect can be connected through a Bluetooth (usually up to 10 meters) and with the special application upload and play any custom audio file, by anyone, as no password is required.

==Furbish-English phrases==
&quot;Furbish&quot; is the Furbies&#x27; language, with simple syllables, short words, and various sounds. A newly purchased Furby starts out speaking entirely in Furbish. Over time, the Furby gradually replaces Furbish words and phrases with English.

The voice commands the 2005 Furbies respond to include:
* wee-tah-kah-loo-loo: Tell me a joke.
* wee-tah-kah-wee-loo: Tell me a story.
* wee-tee-kah-wah-tee: Sing me a song.
* u-nye-loo-lay-doo?: Do you want to play?
* u-nye-ay-tay-doo?: Are you hungry?
* u-nye-boh-doo?: How are you?
* u-nye-way-loh-nee-way: Go to sleep now.
* u-nye-noh-lah: Show me a dance.

Furbies may say these Furbish words:
* doo?: What? (Furbies say this when called)
* doo-dah: Yes. (Furbies say this in response to a command before doing it)
* boo: No. (Furbies say this when they do not want to carry out a command)
* yoo?: Why will you not play with me today? (This usually means the Furby is upset)

==Film adaptation==
Bob Weinstein announced in November 2016 that a Furby film adaptation is to be produced by The Weinstein Company (TWC). The film was written by Daniel Persitz and Devon Kliger, and will contain both live action and animated characters. In regards to the film&#x27;s narrative, Hasbro executive Stephen Davis stated that &quot;we think that this can resonate as a four-quadrant film. It can&#x27;t just be a 90-minute commercial.&quot; TWC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 19, 2018. On May 1, 2018, Lantern Capital emerged as the winner of the studio&#x27;s bankruptcy auction. On July 16, 2018, it was announced that TWC had shut down and its assets had been sold to the newly created Lantern Entertainment. It is unclear whether Lantern Entertainment will take over producing the project.

<doc id="207455" wikidata="Q157728" url="?curid=207455" title="Fichtel Mountains">
<text>The Fichtel Mountains (, ) is a mountain range in Germany and the Czech Republic. They extend from the valley of the Red Main River in northeastern Bavaria to the Karlovy Vary Region in western Czech Republic. The Fichtel Mountains contain an important nature park, the Fichtel Mountain Nature Park. The Elster Mountains are a part of the Fichtel Mountains.

==Etymology==
The first person to write about the Fichtel Mountains, Matthias of Kemnath (actually Matthias Widmann, born 23 February 1429 in Kemnath) reported in 1476: &quot;Ein bergk, hoch, weitt, wolbekant ligt in Beiern, gnant der Fichtelberg&quot; (&quot;A mountain, high, wide and well-known, lies in Bavaria, known as the Fichtelberg&quot;). In descriptions of the border in 1499 and 1536, the mountain that is now called the Ochsenkopf was called &quot;Vichtelberg&quot;; thereafter the name was extended to the whole mountain region. It is also mentioned in old documents: around 1317 the lords of Hirschberg were enfeoffed &quot;inter alia&quot; with the &quot;walt zu dem Vythenberge&quot;. By the 14th century iron ore was being extracted in the &quot;St. Veith&quot; Pit on the southern foot of the mountain. &quot;Vyth → Veit → Fichtel&quot;. High-profile local-history and name researchers have still not had the last word.

A folk etymology connecting the name &quot;Fichtelgebirge&quot; with the German word &quot;Fichte&quot; (meaning &quot;spruce tree&quot; or &quot;pine tree&quot;) fails to account for the typically non-spruce forests which predominated in the area at the time when the name &quot;Fichtelgebirge&quot; became established.

==Geography==
The Fichtel Mountains have an area of about . The Czech part has an area of . The Fichtel Mountain Nature Park in Germany has an area of .

The Fichtel Mountains lie between the towns of Hof and Weiden. In the west there is a good transport link to the nearby city of Bayreuth.

The county town in the heart of the Fichtel Mountains is Wunsiedel with its Luisenburg Rock Labyrinth. Other main settlements are Marktredwitz, Marktleuthen, Arzberg, Röslau, Weißenstadt, Waldershof, Kirchenlamitz and Tröstau (all on the upper reaches of the Ohře and the Röslau rivers). The largest settlement in the Czech part of the Fichtel Mountains is Aš.

Further to the southeast and south are Bischofsgrün, Fichtelberg, Mehlmeisel, Nagel, Neusorg, Speichersdorf, Kemnath, Erbendorf, Wiesau and Fuchsmühl, in the west are Weidenberg, Creußen, Bayreuth, Goldkronach, Bindlach and Bad Berneck, in the northwest are Gefrees, Zell im Fichtelgebirge, Weißdorf, Münchberg (Obere Saale), and in the north Selb, Rehau and Hof.

The boundary between the (East) Franconian dialect in the north and west and the (North) Bavarian and Upper Palatine dialects in the east and south runs diagonally through the Fichtel from northeast to southwest. This language border does not coincide with the administrative boundary of Upper Franconia and the Upper Palatinate, but, for example, Bavarian is also spoken in the Upper Franconian district of Wunsiedel. Moreover, there are descendants of those who, after World War II came from Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia and East Prussia into the Fichtel Mountains, and who make up a significant percentage of the population.

==Geomorphology==

In terms of geomorphological division of Germany, the Fichtel Mountains forms a major natural region called the Thuringian-Franconian Highlands (no. D48 and 39) together with the Thuringian Forest, Thuringian Highland and Franconian Forest. In terms of geomorphological division of the Czech Republic, the Fichtel Mountains is a mesoregion within the Ore Mountains Highlands together with Ore Mountains and Elbe Sandstone Mountains. The Elster Mountains are the northwestern part of the Fichtel Mountains.

Geomorphologically the Fichtel Mountains are a horseshoe-shaped massif consisting of several linked ridges, hence the term Fichtel Mountain Horseshoe (&quot;Fichtelgebirgs-Hufeisen&quot;). The most important are the:

* High Fichtel Mountains with the Schneeberg, Ochsenkopf and Kösseine massif,
* Northern ridge of Waldstein including the mountains of Großer Waldstein, Epprechtstein and Kornberg
* Southern section with its Steinwald and Reichsforst forests and the Kohlberg mountain
* Inner Fichtel Plateau.

To the northeast the Fichtel Mountains transitions into the Ore Mountains, to the southeast is the Upper Palatine Forest, the Bohemian Forest and the Bavarian Forest. To the northwest is a clear geological divide with the Franconian and Thuringian forests. To the southwest it descends to the morphologically very different Franconian fault-block landscape.

In early times the Fichtel was known as the &#x27;navel of Germany&#x27; (&quot;Nabel Deutschlands&quot;) or the &#x27;wellspring of Europe&#x27; (&quot;Herzbrunnen Europas&quot;) because four important rivers rise here and flow in four different directions of the compass:

* to the north flows the Saxon Saale
* to the east flows the Ohře, known here as the Eger and its tributary, the Röslau
* to the south two headstreams of the Naab: the Fichtelnaab in the centre and the Haidenaab to one side
* to the west the White Main
Numerous moors and marshes, which are now protected, are valuable water collectors. The European watershed from the North Sea to the Black Sea runs over these mountains.

=== Mountains and hills ===
The highest mountain is the Schneeberg at . Rivers rising from the Fichtel Mountains are the White Main, the Saxon Saale, the Ohře and the Fichtelnaab which later joins the Waldnaab. Major towns on the edge of the mountain region are Bayreuth and Hof.

While the mountains dip gradually away to the north and the south, they form a steep slope in the west where the Red Main forms the boundary of the mountains.

The Ochsenkopf (&quot;Ox Head&quot;) is the second highest mountain of the Fichtel Mountains, at . There are two chair-lifts to the summit, one from Bischofsgrün in the north and one from Fleckl in the south. The &quot;Asenturm&quot; (Æsir Tower) is an observation tower on the summit with a restaurant attached.

The following are the highest and best-known mountains in the Fichtel Mountains (listed with heights in metres (m) above sea level (NN):
== Geology ==

=== Early mountain building ===

Geologically the Fichtel massif consists mainly of granite. The history of its orogeny begins in the Precambrian Eon about 750–800 million years ago. From that time only the truncated uplands of the once-towering mountain chain are left.

Subsequently, the area was covered by sea, and rivers transported sediments from the old eroding mountains on the coast. These sediments were deposited as layers of clay, sand and limestone.

At the beginning of the Cambrian Period, about 570 million years ago, these beds were folded and raised up to form new mountains. High temperatures and pressure during this mountain folding process, which lasted into the Upper Carboniferous Period, created metamorphic rock. The shale layers were transformed into phyllites and schists, sandstones metamorphosed into quartzite and limestone produced Wunsiedel marble. These mountains, which may have been several kilometres high, were also eroded to sea level again.
=== Variscan orogeny: mountains from the depths of the sea ===
In the next phase, great, deep-sea sediments were laid down under the present-day Fichtel Mountains and the Franconian Forest from the Silurian, Devonian and Lower Carboniferous periods; these are especially well recorded in the Franconian Forest, whose rocks were only subject to very low-grade metamorphism (associated with volcanism and ore formation) and which contain easily dated fossils. Finally, in the Upper Carboniferous period 285 million years ago, the Hercynian mountain building phase began and raised the Fichtel Mountains, Franconian Forest and Münchberg gneiss plateau into high mountains – like almost all the fold mountains formed during the Hercynian period. This mountain building episode was the &quot;Variscan orogeny&quot;, named after Hof&#x27;s Latin name (and the tribe of Varisci) of &quot;Curia variscorum&quot;. At the same time, magma intruded in several phases into the folds, where it solidified under the Earth&#x27;s surface into the present-day granites. As granite formed, secondary rocks were only affected by slight contact metamorphism. The rest of the molten rock with its ore-containing fluids formed pegmatite, as well as veins of ore and minerals – the basis of the medieval mining industry and early industrialisation of this region.

During the Upper Carboniferous and Lower Permian (&quot;Rotliegendes&quot;) large quantities of rock debris were deposited in intramontane basins and onto the foreland of the mountain range. These basins were formed by extensional tectonics which were accompanied by an intermediate to acidic volcanism. The sediments of the &quot;Rotliegendes&quot; are only exposed in a few places, but have been confirmed across a wide area by drilling beneath the platform southwest of the Franconian Line. Late Variscan volcanic rocks occur in the Fichtel Mountains as layers of rhyolite.

=== Alpine orogeny creates new pressures ===
In the neogene (Upper Tertiary beginning 26 million years ago) period, tectonic activity increased again – just as the Alpine orogeny (Alps, Carpathians etc.) slowly came to an end. In that time, parts of this and other older massifs (such as the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands or Bohemian Massif in the Alpine foothills) sometimes ended up underneath younger rock. In the Upper Miocene (10 million years ago), molten basalt broke through in northern Upper Palatinate as the Eger Graben was being formed. Through erosion, the remains of former diatremes have been uncovered and may be seen e.g. on the Rauher Kulm or at Parkstein near Weiden. Basaltic surface layers, i.e. extensive flows of low-viscosity lava, are visible e. g. on the Teichelberg near Pechbrunn. These basaltic nappes should not however be confused with the formation of tectonic layers.

The formation of the present landscape finally took place in the younger Pliocene about 5 million years ago: an earlier-formed Franconian fault line came under pressure again and the Fichtel Mountains, Franconian Forest, the Münchberg Gneiss Massif and the northern Upper Palatine Forest were uplifted along it. This last uplift gave the forces of erosion more to do again and the rivers cut deeply into the already, almost levelled, mountain range. So the present day structure was created from a plateau: a low mountain range which is being gnawed away at on all sides, with a long and varied history. Although often difficult to interpret, it is an &#x27;Eldorado&#x27; for geologists from a wide range of specialisms.

=== Predominant rock types ===
Granite ( for grain) and its derivatives
make up about 40% of the area – its impact being all the more striking because this very hard, yet hydrous, rock forms the highest peaks in the area. Its stark appearance and the early emergency of industry here have made their mark on landscape and people.

In detail there is:
* &quot;Porphyritic Granite&quot; of the Weißenstadt/Liebenstein massif (including the towns of Marktleuthen/Röslau) and extending into the Czech Republic as far as Haslau. The &quot;porphyry&quot; contains biotite (dark mica) and phenocrysts of feldspar up to 8 cm across.
* &quot;Reut Granite&quot; near Gefrees is, by contrast, finer with a bluish-grey hue. Selb Granite (found northeast of the upper massif near Schwarzenhammer and running through the Selb Forest and the Czech Republic into Saxony/ Elster Mountains) is fine-grained, but grey again.
* &quot;Holzmühl Granite&quot; occurs in just two small outcrops near Holzmühl, 3 km southeast of Marktleuthen and near Längenau on the Wartberg, east-northeast of Selb; medium-grained with a higher biotite content, unevenly grained microstructure.
* &quot;Redwitzite&quot; is also called &quot;Syenite Granite&quot; and occurs in the Marktredwitz/Arzberg/Thiersheim triangle; medium- and also fine-grained, its variable mineral composition produces colourations from light grey, dark grey and dark green-grey to almost black.
* &quot;Rand Granite (Dach Granite)&quot; occurs in all the prominent massifs of the Fichtel Mountains (the Ochsenkopf, the southern part of the Schneeberg and the Haberstein, the Platte to the Hohe Matze, the Kösseine and the Großer Kornberg); its groundmass is small-grained with phenocrysts of feldspar, quartz and biotite, sometimes sprinkled with muscovite as well;
* &quot;Kösseine-Rand Granite&quot; occurs on the Kösseine, including the Burgstein, Haberstein and Schauerberg, and the southern part of the Großer Kornberg massif; small- to medium-grained, porphyritic structure weak or missing; low in phenocrysts.
* &quot;Kern Granite&quot; is found in the central Fichtelberg/Ochsenkopf/Nußhardt block and on the eastern perimeter of the Schneeberg; it forms outcrops of in the shape of numerous rock formations; medium- to coarse-grained.
* &quot;Kösseine and Wolfsgarten Kern Granite.&quot; There are numerous pockets of Kösseine Granite containing hornfels, cm-large biotite-rich shreds and nodules of host rock, rounded or round quartz-feldspar rich pockets on the Kösseine massif: narrow band on the north, east and southern edge, small labyrinth, Kleinwendern quarry, Hirschensprung rock formation, Wolfstein, Hohenstein, Ochsenkopf, Hundslohe and Gregnitz valley; on the Kornberg: the Wolfsgarten forest and the south-southwestern part of the Großer Kornberg; relatively coarse, has an unusual appearance due to the blue feldspar, black biotite and richly sprinkled dark foreign bodies; Wolfsgarten Granite is somewhat lighter blue.
* &quot;Zinn Granite&quot; is restricted to the central massif and occurs on the Rudolfstein, on the Drei Brüder almost to the summit of the Schneeberg, western slope of the Seehügel, between Seehügel and Platte, Fuchsbau and Zufurt west of Leupoldsdorf; very even, medium grain; little biotite, a lot of muscovite; lighter, brighter hue.
* &quot;Rand Granite&quot; of the Steinwald massif: in the western part of the Steinwald, e. g. on the Dachsfelsen, and the northwestern part of the Grandfelsen; small-grained.
* &quot;Steinwald Granite&quot; occurs in the centre, including the Weißenstein, Platte, Katzentrögel, Reiseneggerfelsen and Hackelstein; coarse-grained.
* &quot;Friedenfels Granite&quot; is the transitional facies between the Steinwald Granite and the Falkenberg Porphyritic Granite; it forms the basement of the Pechbrunn basalt region and surfaces there at various places between the basalt nappes; porphyritic structure, especially rich in feldspar phenocrysts.

== Mining industry ==
By the Early Middle Ages man had begun to mine in the Fichtel Mountains. The most important products were gold, tin, iron, minerals, earths and rock (basalt, brown coal, diabase, granite, silt, marble, soapstone, clay and peat). In earlier times uranium ore deposits were discovered. The metals were worked in hammer mills (hence the many place names ending with -hammer) on the Fichtel&#x27;s rivers, in furnaces and at metalsmiths. The forests of the Fichtel Mountains supplied the wood necessary for the manufacture of charcoal. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the mining industry became depressed and the ore deposits were largely exhausted. In the 18th century Alexander von Humboldt tried to revive the mining industry again. Many towns and villages (e. g. Wunsiedel, Weißenstadt, Arzberg, Fichtelberg-Neubau, Goldkronach) owe their emergence to the mining industry.

An insight into the history of mining in the Fichtel Mountains may be gained from:
* the visitor mine of Gleissinger Fels near Fichtelberg-Neubau
* the Schmutzler gallery near Goldkronach
* the gold mining museum in Goldkronach
* the mining exhibition in the Fichtelgebirge Museum at Wunsiedel
* the mining industry information point at Arzberg
* the local heritage and mining museum in Erbendorf

== Traditions ==
The Huguenots introduced the Easter decorations on wells, so-called Osterbrunnen, in the shape of a lily (emblem of the Bourbon kings) (as described e.g. in the April 2007 of the &quot;Fränkische Post&quot;).

== Economy and tourism ==
There are many places in the Fichtel Mountains that still produce glassware at competitive prices. The porcelain industry, centred on the town of Selb, is internationally renowned and the foremost in Germany. Local firms such as Rosenthal and Hutschenreuther are of international standing.

Tourism is the main source of income for many places in the Fichtel Mountains today. In some towns such as Bischofsgrün tourism has a long tradition going back to the 1920s. After the Second World War the stream of holidaymakers increased sharply, both in summer for walking and in winter for winter sports. The Fichtel Mountains became the local mountain range (&quot;Hausgebirge&quot;) for (West-)Berliners who, unable to holiday in East Germany, were able to get there on the transit route of the A 9 motorway. This has changed since German reunification and the opening up of other mountainous holiday areas.

The Fichtel Mountains are a nationally important holiday destination in winter. Several lifts, the longest being two chair lifts on the Ochsenkopf, but also a plethora of cut cross-country trails are the mainstay of this industry.

The Fichtel Mountains attract many tourists throughout the year. In the winter the mountains are a common destination for people seeking outdoor recreational sports like alpine skiing, cross country skiing, and sledding. The warmer summer months find people mountain biking, hiking, and sight seeing amongst the many large rock formations.

<text>USS &quot;Dolphin&quot;, a schooner, was the second ship of the United States Navy named for the aquatic mammal.

&quot;Dolphin&quot; was launched on 23 June 1821 by the Philadelphia Navy Yard and sent to New York City to be readied for sea. Assigned to duty as one of two vessels making up the newly organized Pacific Squadron, she sailed 8 December 1821 under the command of Lieutenant David Conner, in company with ship-of-the line &quot;Franklin&quot;.

&quot;Dolphin&quot; arrived at Valparaíso, Chile, on 6 February 1822, and cruised on the coasts of Ecuador, Peru, and Chile to protect American commerce and the whaling industry. Between 18 August 1825 and 24 August 1826, under the commanded by Lieut. Com. John Percival, she cruised to search for the mutineers of the American whaler &quot;Globe&quot;, returning to Callao, with the two surviving members of the mutiny. During this cruise, she visited Hawaii where she assisted men of the American ship &quot;London&quot; wrecked there, and helped other American citizens in the islands.

==Fate==

&quot;Dolphin&quot; served in the Pacific until 2 December 1835 when the Navy sold her.

<text>Christchurch () is a town and civil parish on the south coast of Dorset, England. The parish had a population of 31,372 in 2021. It adjoins Bournemouth to the west, with the New Forest to the east. Part of the historic county of Hampshire, Christchurch was a borough within the administrative county of Dorset from 1974 until 2019, when it became part of the new Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole unitary authority.

Founded in the 7th century at the confluence of the rivers Avon and Stour which flow into Christchurch Harbour, the town was originally named Twynham but became known as Christchurch following the construction of the priory in 1094. The town developed into an important trading port, and was fortified in the 9th century. Further defences were added in the 12th century with the construction of a castle, which was destroyed during the English Civil War by the Parliamentarian Army. During the 18th and 19th centuries, smuggling flourished and became one of the town&#x27;s most lucrative industries. The town was heavily fortified during the Second World War as a precaution against an expected invasion, and in 1940 an Airspeed factory was established on the town&#x27;s airfield to make aircraft for the Royal Air Force.

The town&#x27;s harbour, beaches, nature reserves and historically important buildings have made Christchurch a popular tourist destination. Bournemouth Airport, an international airport which handled around 800,000 passengers in 2019, is within the former borough boundary at Hurn. The airport&#x27;s industrial park contains a number of aerospace and engineering businesses and is one of the largest employment sites in Dorset.

==History==

Christchurch was founded in approximately AD 650 by missionaries sent to Wessex by St Birinus, the first Bishop of Dorchester (Oxfordshire). They settled on a stretch of raised land between the rivers Avon and Stour which carried people and their wares to and from market settlements such as Blandford and Old Sarum (near modern Salisbury). The harbour became one of the most important in Saxon England as it was easily reached from the continent and boats could travel up the river Avon to Salisbury. The town appears in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; entry of 901 as &quot;Tweoxneam&quot; (Twynham) from Old English &quot;betweoxn&quot; (between) and &quot;ēam&quot; (rivers). In around 890 AD, Alfred the Great considered Twynham to be of such strategic importance that, with the threat of invasion by the Danes, he made it a burh and defensive walls were erected around the town. In 1094 a chief minister of King William II, Ranulf Flambard, then Dean of Twynham, began the building of a priory on the site of the original mission church. Soon after the construction of the priory the town became known as Christchurch.
Some time in the early 12th century, a castle was built within the town. Originally a wooden fort built by Richard de Redvers, first cousin to King Henry I, it was rebuilt in stone by Baldwin de Redvers to resist King Stephen during the civil war with the Empress Matilda. The castle again saw action during the Civil War of 1642–1651 when occupied by the Parliamentarians. Christchurch changed hands a number of times: originally under Royalist control, it was captured by Sir William Waller&#x27;s Parliamentary army in 1644. Lord Goring briefly retook the town in 1645 but was obliged to withdraw and returned with a larger force days later and laid siege to the castle. However, the Parliamentarians withstood the siege and maintained their hold on the town. Fearing such a powerful stronghold might once again fall into Royalist hands, Cromwell ordered the castle to be destroyed in 1652.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stannard p135/136&quot;&gt;Stannard (1999) pp. 135–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the fishing industry thrived in Christchurch, the importance of the harbour declined as it became inaccessible to vessels of a large draught. The harbour entrance was particularly troublesome with constantly shifting sandbars. In 1665 Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, bought the Lordship of the Manor of Christchurch. As part of his plans to improve trade in the town, he attempted to resolve the problems with the harbour entrance by cutting a new one through the sandspit at the foot of Hengistbury Head. However, upon completion the new entrance repeatedly silted up and in 1703 a large storm damaged a groyne which blocked the entrance entirely. Over the following 150 years alternative schemes were proposed but none were ever taken up.
Smuggling was one of Christchurch&#x27;s most lucrative industries during the 18th and 19th centuries due to easy access to neighbouring towns and the difficult harbour entrance which acted as a barrier to customs cutters. Many townspeople were involved in this illegal trade and large quantities of wealth were accumulated. In 1784 a confrontation between a gang of local smugglers and Customs and Excise officers led to the Battle of Mudeford in which a Royal Navy officer was killed and a smuggler subsequently executed. Another important industry during this period was the manufacture of fusee chains for watches and clocks. In 1790, Robert Cox began to manufacture fusee chains in workshops in the High Street. By 1793 Cox gained a monopoly on chain production in Britain, supplying watch, clock and chronometer makers throughout the country. In 1845 William Hart opened a similar factory in Bargates. However, by 1875 the chains were no longer required due to changes in watch designs and the factories were closed.

The railway came to Christchurch in 1847 although the nearest station, Christchurch Road, was at Holmsley and passengers were taken the rest of the way by omnibus. In 1862 a new station was built in the town close to where it stands today and was served by a branch line from Ringwood. Christchurch joined the mainline in 1883, and a third station had to be built. Christchurch, and in particular Mudeford, had been enjoying a modest tourist trade since King George III had patronised the town in the 1790s but the arrival of the railways made Christchurch accessible to more potential visitors. A power station was built in Christchurch in 1903 to power the public trams. The excess generated was sufficient to light the town, and it was added to the national grid in 1940.
The Fisher Aviation Company began to provide flights from fields at the eastern end of Somerford Road in 1930, and by 1933 the company had flown over 19,000 passengers. In 1934, they obtained permission to establish an aerodrome on the site which became known as Christchurch Airfield. During the Second World War an Airspeed factory was built on the airfield, and began manufacturing aircraft for the RAF; the USAAF Ninth Air Force established a base there in 1944. A second aerodrome opened at Hurn in 1944 which became Bournemouth Airport. In 1940, with the German 6th Army at Cherbourg, Christchurch was fortified against an expected invasion: the construction of pillboxes, gun emplacements and tank traps in and around the town, made Christchurch an &quot;anti-tank island&quot;. Between 1941 and 1942 Donald Bailey developed the Bailey bridge at the Military Engineering Experimental Establishment at Christchurch Barracks.

Much development with a large increase in housing occurred from the mid-18th century. In 1873, of common land north of the town known as Portfield was enclosed and built upon and the town&#x27;s population rapidly expanded. During the 20th century further development has seen the population grown from a little over 11,000 to more than 45,000. In the 1950s a large housing estate was built to the east of the town centre and in 1958 a bypass was constructed which redirected traffic using the town&#x27;s high street as the main thoroughfare to and from London and Southampton. In 1974 the town was transferred from the county of Hampshire to Dorset following local government reorganisation and was granted borough status by a Royal Charter.

==Government and politics==

There are two tiers of local government covering Christchurch, at civil parish (town) and unitary authority level: Christchurch Town Council, and Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council. The town council is based at the Old Town Hall at 30 High Street, which was built in 1859.

===Administrative history===
Christchurch was historically in Hampshire and was both an ancient borough and an ancient parish. The parish extended beyond the borough, also including a large surrounding rural area. The borough was given a royal charter in 1315, confirming earlier borough rights which had been granted by the De Redvers family as lords of the manor. The borough is known to have had a mayor from at least 1297. It was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1886.

The parish of Christchurch was gradually subdivided into smaller civil parishes. The chapelry of Holdenhurst was a separate civil parish from medieval times. As the town of Bournemouth began to develop from the early 19th century, it initially straddled the parishes of Christchurch and Holdenhurst, continuing to do so even after Bournemouth was made a borough in 1890. The Local Government Act 1894 directed that parishes were no longer allowed to straddle borough boundaries. The parish of Christchurch was therefore reduced to match the borough of Christchurch, and a parish of Bournemouth was created matching that borough. The parts of the old Christchurch and Holdenhurst parishes outside the two boroughs were split into six rural parishes: Christchurch East, Holdenhurst, Hurn, Pokesdown, Southbourne and Winton. The southern part of Christchurch East was made a separate parish called Highcliffe in 1897. Highcliffe was subsequently absorbed into the parish and borough of Christchurch in 1932.
The old municipal borough of Christchurch was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 and replaced with a larger non-metropolitan district of Christchurch, which was transferred from Hampshire to Dorset. Christchurch&#x27;s borough status was transferred to the new district, allowing the council to take the name Christchurch Borough Council and giving the chair of the council the title of mayor, continuing Christchurch&#x27;s series of mayors dating back to the 13th century. The new borough covered the area of the old borough plus the parish of Hurn (including an area transferred to it from Sopley) and a new parish of Burton, created from the western part of the old Christchurch East parish. The remainder of Christchurch East became a new parish called Bransgore and stayed in Hampshire as part of the New Forest District.

Christchurch Borough Council was a lower-tier district council, with county-level services provided by Dorset County Council. The borough council was initially based at the Town Hall, which at that time was much larger, incorporating adjoining former school buildings to the rear. In 1980 the council moved to new Civic Offices on Bridge Street, after which most of the Town Hall was demolished to make way for the Saxon Square shopping centre, retaining only the original 1859 section.

The borough of Christchurch was abolished in 2019, merging with Bournemouth and Poole to become a new local government district called Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, the council of which is a unitary authority, being a district council which also performs the functions of a county council. The merger was opposed by Christchurch Borough Council, which unsuccessfully challenged the government&#x27;s decision to proceed with it in the courts.

Ahead of the borough&#x27;s abolition in 2019, the parishes in the borough were reviewed. The existing parish of Burton was renamed &#x27;Burton and Winkton&#x27;, and the unparished part of the borough (corresponding to the pre-1974 municipal borough of Christchurch) was made into two new parishes, one called Christchurch and the other called &#x27;Highcliffe and Walkford&#x27;. The new parish arrangements took effect on 1 April 2019, being the same day that the old borough was replaced by Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole. The new Christchurch parish council takes the style &#x27;town council&#x27;, with its chair being the mayor. The Old Town Hall was transferred to the new town council, which uses it as its headquarters. The Civic Offices on Bridge Street transferred to the BCP Council. They were closed in 2021 pending a proposed sale, after the new council consolidated its offices at Bournemouth Town Hall.

===Parliamentary representation===
Christchurch is represented by a single parliamentary constituency in the House of Commons. The seat was recreated in 1983 from parts of the Christchurch and Lymington, North Dorset and New Forest constituencies, and was held by Robert Adley (Conservative) from its creation until his death in 1993. At the by-election Diana Maddock (Liberal Democrat) was elected with a swing of 35.4%, one of the largest-ever swings against a sitting party. The seat was retaken by Conservative candidate Christopher Chope in 1997, and retained in 2001 and 2005. In the 2010 general election, Chope retained his seat with a considerable majority of 15,410 and 56.4% of the vote, making Christchurch one of the safest Conservative constituencies in the country. Christchurch was part of the South West England constituency for elections to the European Parliament.

In the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, the borough of Christchurch voted by 59% to leave.

==Geography==
Christchurch is the most easterly coastal town of the administrative county of Dorset, and it lies within the historic county of Hampshire. The town abuts Bournemouth to the west and is approximately east of Poole, west of Southampton, south of Salisbury. The town centre lies between the rivers Avon and Stour which flow directly into Christchurch Harbour. The borough boundaries stretched to Hurn Forest in the north encompassing Bournemouth Airport and eastwards along the coast as far as Walkford. The River Stour forms a natural boundary to the west; the estuary and harbour form the southern boundary.
Christchurch Harbour contains large areas of salt marsh and is protected by a sandbar known as Mudeford Spit which has fine sandy beach on both sides of a walkway lined with beach huts. The harbour is protected by a natural headland (Hengistbury Head) at the start of the sandbanks, and is a special site for sand martins which nest annually in the sandy cliffs. The harbour is only accessible to shallow draught boats drawing up to due to the sandbars at the entrance. The entrance, known as the Run, has Mudeford Quay on one side and the spit on the other. Considerable tides flow here: up to during spring tides. The harbour is a protected wildlife refuge and is home to large populations of swans, waders and other bird life. On the south side, the harbour is enclosed by Hengistbury Head which was the site of the earliest settlement here dating back to the Bronze Age. The landward end of the headland has a bank and ditch known as Double Dykes, built in about 700 BC, to protect the ancient settlement.

Stanpit Marsh is a nature reserve situated just below the confluence of the Rivers Avon and Stour. During the 18th century it was notorious for smugglers landing tobacco and rum in the narrow channels of Christchurch Harbour. It contains areas of salt marsh and freshwater marsh with reed beds and is home to grazing horses, rare birds, and 14 species of rare or endangered plants. It was designated as a Local Nature Reserve in 1964, and a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1986.

To the north of Christchurch is St Catherine&#x27;s Hill, the highest part of the borough at above sea level. This hill is the most southerly of a chain of three hills, some long with area of heathland and coniferous forest. The New Forest, Christchurch Priory, Hengistbury Head, Avon Valley, Christchurch Bay, The Solent and The Needles of the Isle of Wight can be seen from viewpoints on the east side of the Hill. Stour Valley way, Poole Bay and the Isle of Purbeck can be viewed from the south-west side of the Hill. Due to its commanding views, St. Catherine&#x27;s Hill has been in use since prehistoric times as a look-out area and beacon and in more recent years served as a military training ground. The hill is home to protected and rare wildlife species, including the Dartford warbler, nightjar, and the sand lizard.

The geology of the borough is unremarkable; the bedrock is mainly composed of sand with patches of clay to the east and west, and superficial deposits (drift) of sand and gravel cover the entire area. The extraction of sand and gravel for construction purposes is carried out in the borough, and the opening of more sites is planned.

===Climate===
Christchurch, like the rest of the country, has a temperate climate with a small variation in daily and annual temperatures. The presence of the Gulf Stream ensures that the British Isles maintain an all-year-round ambient temperature, and, because of its position on the south coast of England, Christchurch has slightly warmer winters and cooler summers than settlements further inland. The warmest months in Christchurch are July and August, which have an average temperature range of , and the coolest months are January and February, which have a range of . The average annual rainfall of is well below the UK average of .

=== Green belt ===

Christchurch lies at the centre of a green belt region that extends into the wider surrounding counties. It is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the South East Dorset conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.

The area is (2010) in size, and lies mainly to the north of the district, with portions surrounding the fringes of the Christchurch/Highcliffe-on-Sea urban area. Suburbs also excluded are Jumpers Common, the built up area of Burton, as well as Bournemouth Airport, with the rest of the borough including the rural portions and hamlets in the Hurn and Burton parishes being &#x27;washed over&#x27; by the green belt.

Landscape features and greenfield facilities within include the rivers Stour, Moors, Avon and their floodplains, Christchurch Priory, Chapel Lane solar farm, Blackwater and St Catherine&#x27;s hills, Hurn Forest, Stanpit Marsh, Mudeford Spit, and the Adventure Wonderland theme park. The New Forest National Park in Hampshire borders the green belt to the east of the borough in Burton parish.

==Demography==
The Christchurch parish had a population of 31,372 in 2021, and around 50,000 for the wider borough, making it the fourth most populous settlement in Dorset. It lies in the South East Dorset conurbation which is one of the South Coast&#x27;s major urban areas with a total population of over 400,000.
Christchurch has one of the oldest populations in the country with significant proportion of residents wealthy senior citizens. The percentage of the population aged over 65 in Christchurch is 30.4%, almost double the national average of 16.5%. Highcliffe on the borough&#x27;s eastern boundary possesses the highest percentage of elderly residents in the entire United Kingdom at 69%. The Office for National Statistics predicted that by 2031, the percentage of residents over 65 will rise to 37.9. In 2005, the life expectancy of female residents was 83.4 years and male residents 79.7 years. This was an increase on ten years previous (1995) when the life expectancy was 82.6 years and 77.0 years for females and males respectively.

In common with the rest of Dorset, Christchurch has low numbers of black and minority ethnic groups: the vast majority (96.83%) consider themselves to be White British. Other white groups account for a further 2.09% and those of mixed race 0.44%. Asian and British Asian make up the next largest group with 0.25% of the local population, followed by Chinese, 0.16%, black, 0.13% and 0.11% from other ethnic groups. Over 55% of the economically active population are in full-time employment; a further 22% work on a part-time basis. Of those in employment, over 40% of the borough&#x27;s residents have a high skill level occupation and 17% have a low level one. Some 28.18% have no formal qualifications but 16.63% have a level 4 qualification or above (first or higher degree, HNC, HND, NVQ levels 4 or 5).

Christchurch contains around 22,800 properties.
In 2005 the average price of a detached house in Christchurch was £323,416. On average property in Christchurch is 24% more expensive than anywhere else in England and Wales. Nearly 80% of residences are owner occupied, 3% are vacant and a further 3% are second homes. The borough has around 25,000 cars: an average of 1.21 per household. Christchurch, in common with the rest of Dorset, has lower crime rates than average for the UK. Reported crime rates per 1,000 of the population in 2006 (with figures for 2001 in brackets) are as follows: violence against the person 10.4 (4.8), sexual offences 0.7 (0.3), robbery 0.2 (0.3), burglary 2.2 (4.0), theft of vehicles 0.9 (2.5), theft from vehicles 3.6 (7.2).

==Economy==
Between 2000 and 2007 the total Gross Value Added (GVA) of the borough grew by 37% from £552 million to £757 million. The biggest contributor to the local economy through the period 2000–2007 was the transport and communication sector which in 2007 brought in £145 million GVA; £64 million more than in 2000. The sector which saw the largest growth during that period however, was metals and engineering which increased by 140%. The food, textiles and wood industries experienced the largest negative change at −42% whereas the electronics industry experienced the biggest fall with £16.2 million less than seven years previous.

An aircraft manufacturing industry was established in the town with the construction of an Airspeed factory at Christchurch Airfield in 1942. In 1948 the factory became part of de Havilland and manufactured a wide range of aircraft such as the Vampire, Sea Venom and Sea Vixen. In the 1950s, Bournemouth Airport, a former RAF base situated on the outskirts of borough boundaries at Hurn, also became heavily involved in aircraft production after Vickers Armstrong—which later became the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC)—established a factory at the airport. Although the de Havilland factory closed down in 1962 and aircraft manufacturing at Bournemouth Airport ceased by the late 1970s, the aircraft and engineering industries remained important to the local economy. Major employers in Christchurch include: BAE Systems, Bournemouth Aviation Services Company (BASCO), Beagle Aerospace, Channel Express, College of Air Traffic Control, Data Track Process Instruments, European Aviation, FR Aviation, Honeywell, Reid Steel, Revvo Castor Company, Sainsbury&#x27;s, Siemens VAI and SELEX Communications.

The town&#x27;s High Street has 48 shops with of retail space. The addition of the Saxon Square shopping precinct in 1982 added a further of shop floor to the town centre—an increase of 67.5%. The combined number of shops and floor space makes Christchurch the fifth largest shopping centre in Dorset.

In 2008, Christchurch attracted some 837,000 staying visitors and 792,000 day visitors, and tourism generated £76million for the local economy.
Although important to the local economy, Christchurch is not so heavily dependent on tourism as some of its neighbours. In 2008, visitor accommodation consisted of 11 caravan and camping parks, and some 900 bed spaces in eight hotels and 75 guest houses or bed and breakfast establishments.

==Culture==

A weekly market was granted to the town by Baldwin de Redvers and the first market took place in 1149 at the junction of Castle Street and High Street. These weekly markets stopped in 1872 but resumed a century later in a car park next to the town hall, now the site of Saxon Square. When construction of the square began in 1983, the market was moved to a car park in Bank Close. Today it is held every Monday in High Street which is then closed to traffic. Periodically there are food fairs and a French market in the town.

Every year since 2000 the town has held a food and wine festival during May. It includes an international food market with over 100 stalls selling food and drink, and a large marquee with a kitchen area erected in Saxon Square. Here cooking demonstrations are given, sometimes by a celebrity chef: past guests have included Gary Rhodes and Jean-Christophe Novelli. The week-long festival is a community event which aims to educate people in healthy eating as well as the availability of foods. During the festival local chefs are invited into schools to demonstrate recipes; and throughout the weekend the marquee hosts a cookery workshop for 7- to 10-year-olds.

Christchurch holds an annual music festival on the first weekend in July. Originally a folk festival, the event has evolved to cater for a wider variety of tastes: clog and morris dancing groups and salsa and belly dancing exhibitions have featured. Rock bands and soul groups have been included alongside the more traditional types of music. The festival&#x27;s format changes annually but usually takes place on and around the town quay where a large marquee contains the main stage. Local bars often host smaller bands and dancing and exhibitions take place throughout the town centre.

Another annual event is the regatta which has been held every year since 1909. It takes place around the second week in August and involves rowing competitions on the River Stour and a travelling funfair sited on the adjacent town quay. A carnival procession and large firework display takes place at the weekend. The part of the quay by the priory is known as &quot;The Quomps&quot; and was conveyed to the town in 1911 by Lord Malmesbury. A 19th-century bandstand situated in the Quomps was an anonymous gift to the town in 1938. During the summer months it is used for free open-air concerts on Saturdays, one of the most popular being &quot;Stompin&#x27; on the Quomps&quot;, a smooth jazz festival. On Sunday afternoons brass bands often play there.

The town has a museum: the Red House Museum in Quay Road. Once the town&#x27;s workhouse, the Red House contains permanent and temporary exhibitions pertaining to local history, costume, geology, natural history and archaeology. The museum grounds contain formal and informal gardens. The old power station in Bargates, owned by Scottish and Southern Energy, housed the Museum of Electricity. This is no longer open to the public, although the company is working on new ways to share the museum&#x27;s collection more widely across the UK.

==Landmarks==
===Town centre===
Christchurch&#x27;s town centre encompasses a mixture of traditional public houses, restaurants, coffee shops, antiquated cottages and historic listed buildings. The older part of the town dates from Saxon times and retains its Saxon street layout. The Grade II listed Mayor&#x27;s Parlour was built as the market hall in 1745 at the far end of the High Street but was moved to its present position in 1849. It was enclosed and extended, and used as the town hall until the civic offices were built in the mid-1970s. It was restored to its former condition circa 1982 when the Saxon Square shopping precinct was built.

High Street contains two Grade II listed public houses: Ye Olde George Inne, once a coach house, and the Ship Inn which has the oldest licence in Christchurch. A known haunt of smugglers, the Ship Inn&#x27;s history can be traced back to 1688. At the end of High Street is Church Street which contains Church Hatch, a Grade II* listed Georgian residence. Once the home of Sir Owen Tudor Burne, it was saved from demolition in 1929 by public appeal. Ye Olde Eight Bells, a Grade II listed gift shop in Church Street, was once another alehouse frequented by smugglers and central to a number of local legends. Close by in Castle Street is the Perfumery, a 14th-century thatched property often referred to as the old courthouse; although some local historians maintain that this was next door and long gone.

The town centre contains three Grade I listed bridges. The Town Bridge is a 15th-century ashlar stone bridge composed of two portions separated by a narrow strip of land. The eastern portion crosses the narrower of two branches of the River Avon that pass through the town and features five low round-headed arches. The western bridge features two arches and crosses the millstream which runs adjacent to the Avon. To the east of the Town Bridge on the same route from the town centre the Waterloo Bridge spans the larger branch of the Avon. Built circa 1816–1817 in the mediaeval tradition with dressed Portland stone, its design incorporates five wide segmental arches, circular piers and capped cutwaters. On the northern side of the bridge a modern steel pedestrian footbridge is cantilevered to the older structure.

===Castle===

The Grade I listed Christchurch Castle is of Norman origin and was originally of a motte and bailey construction. The castle once dominated the town but now lies in ruins and only a couple of the keep walls remain. A castle has stood in Christchurch since approximately 924 AD when Edward the Elder fortified the town with a wooden fort on a motte. After the Norman conquest in 1066 the castle&#x27;s defences were strengthened with a ditch and bailey surrounded by a wooden palisade. The wooden fort was replaced; at first with another wooden structure and then a stone keep which was constructed in the 12th century. Within the curtain wall of the castle stands the Constable&#x27;s House, a Grade I listed Norman dwelling. Much of the building&#x27;s stonework remains, including a rare example of a Norman chimney (one of only five in the country) and the privy which extends out across the mill stream. The castle was slighted by the Parliamentary army during the English Civil War to prevent the stronghold from falling into Royalist hands.

===Priory===

Christchurch town centre and the harbour are overlooked by the 11th-century Grade I listed Christchurch Priory. Once a monastery, it was given to the town for use as a parish church by Henry VIII after the dissolution in 1540. It is the longest parish church in England, having a nave over long. The nave and transepts are Norman with heavy columns and round arches, whereas the lady chapel is from the 14th century and more Perpendicular in style. The great choir is even later, having been rebuilt in the 16th century. The Priory is noted for its Miraculous Beam, which attracts pilgrims from all over the world. Within the Priory grounds stands Priory House, a Grade II listed mansion built in 1777 by Gustavus Brander. The Priory is in active use for worship and forms part of the Church of England Diocese of Winchester.

===Place Mill===

Place Mill is a Grade II* listed Anglo-Saxon watermill located a short distance to the south of the Priory on Christchurch Quay. It is mentioned in the Domesday Book and features a mediaeval stone base underneath red brickwork. The mill belonged to the Priory but stopped working in 1908 and stood derelict until purchased by the council and restored in 1981. It is unique in that it takes water from one river (the Avon) and spills it into a second river (the Stour). A millstream is supplied from the Royalty Fisheries near to the Electricity Museum behind Bargates, and flows for nearly to the mill between the Avon and the Priory grounds before joining the River Stour. A mediaeval Grade II listed bridge known as the Place Mill Bridge crosses the millstream nearby.

==Sport and recreation==
The town&#x27;s football team, Christchurch F.C., play at Hurn Bridge Sports Club, which is situated at the junction of the Avon Causeway and Matchams Lane. Established in 1885, the club was a founding member of the Hampshire Football Association in 1887. Christchurch F.C. were promoted as champions to Hampshire League One in 1938, 1948 and 1986; in 1970, they became the first team to win the Bournemouth Senior Cup three times in succession. The club joined the Wessex League (the ninth tier of the English football league system) in 1988 and are one of the few clubs in the league that maintain amateur status.

Hurn Bridge is also the home of Christchurch Cricket Club, who have teams in the Saturday and Sunday Dorset Leagues. In 2009, the first XI won Division 3 having been newly promoted from Division 4; in those two seasons, the team lost only four games. Hurn Bridge houses the Dorset Cricket Centre, an indoor training facility run by the Dorset Cricket Board.

Christchurch has a council run leisure centre, situated at the end of Stony Lane South. The complex contains a swimming pool, golf course and indoor bowling facility which is home to the East Dorset Indoor Bowls Club. Christchurch has a lawn bowling club, Christchurch Bowling Club, that plays on the green adjacent to the castle ruins. The town has two other lawn bowling clubs and golf courses, at Iford and Highcliffe.

Sailing is a popular leisure pursuit in Christchurch and the harbour is home to three sailing clubs: Highcliffe Sailing Club, Mudeford Sailing Club and Christchurch Sailing Club, which are situated at Mudeford Quay, Fisherman&#x27;s Bank and the Town Quay respectively. The other end of the Town Quay is home to the local rowing club.

==Transport==

Christchurch railway station is a stop on the South West Main Line. Services are operated by South Western Railway; their typical off-peak service each hour is:
* One return service between , , and 
* One service from Bournemouth to 
* One service from to Bournemouth.

Christchurch is served by the A35 road, which runs from Devon through to Southampton via Poole, Bournemouth and the New Forest. To the north of the town, the A35 connects to the A31, which is the major trunk road in central southern England and provides access to the M27 motorway at Southampton. The A338 road runs northwards from Bournemouth through Christchurch to Ringwood in Hampshire.

Buses are operated by Go South Coast under their &quot;Morebus&quot; brand. Routes connect Christchurch with Bournemouth, Lymington, New Milton, Ringwood and Somerford.

Bournemouth Airport, in Hurn, is the nearest airport and lies around north-west of Christchurch town centre. Originally an RAF airfield, the airport began commercial services in the late 1950s and served around 800,000 passengers on 2019. Ryanair, TUI and EasyJet operate from the airport, providing scheduled flights to European destinations.

During the summer months, small passenger ferries travel between Tuckton and Mudeford Spit, via the town quay. Another ferry crosses the Stour between Wick and the Quay just below Tuckton Bridge; this ferry was running before the bridge was built in 1882 and was then, the only crossing below Iford. A third ferry service operates across the harbour entrance from Mudeford Sandbank to Mudeford Quay. This ferry was operated by rowing boats until the 1960s; payment being at the discretion of the passenger.

==Education==

Christchurch has two infant schools, two junior schools, five primary schools (combined infant and junior) and three secondary schools. The secondary schools are, in order of size: Twynham School (1,515 pupils), Highcliffe School (1,347 pupils) and the Grange School (637 pupils). The secondary schools share a sixth form, with the three sites providing different courses.

From 1 April 2019 schools in Christchurch have fallen under the jurisdiction of the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council.

<text>USS &quot;Port Royal&quot; (CG-73) was a guided missile cruiser that served in the United States Navy. She was commissioned on 9 July 1994, as the 27th and final ship of the class. &quot;Port Royal&quot; was named in honor of the two naval battles of Port Royal Sound, South Carolina, one during the American Revolutionary War, the other during the American Civil War. She was decommissioned on 29 September 2022. The ship is the second to bear the name, with the first being a steam-powered, side-wheel gunboat, from New York City, in commission from 1862 to 1866.

==Construction==
The second &quot;Port Royal&quot; (CG-73) was assigned hull number CG-69 on 9 May 1989, but that number was reassigned to guided missile cruiser and CG-73 to &quot;Port Royal&quot; on 8 December 1989; was laid down on 18 October 1991, at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by Ingalls Shipbuilding, Litton Industries; launched on 20 November 1992; sponsored by Susan G. Baker (wife of James A. Baker III, Chief of Staff to President George H. W. Bush and former Secretary of State); and commissioned at Savannah, Georgia, on 9 July 1994.

==Characteristics==

&quot;Port Royal&quot; and are the original cruisers for the navy&#x27;s Linebacker Program (Milestone Phase I, II and III), which provided theater ballistic missile defense capability, as test platforms to detect, track, cue, intercept, and interact with other national assets to shoot down ICBMs. The vessel&#x27;s Aegis and Standard Missile Tracking systems have been upgraded with &quot;long range surveillance and track (LRS&amp;T)&quot;, and the ships were outfitted to carry the modified SM-2 Block IVA TMD. As of 2009, &quot;Port Royal&quot; along with &quot;Lake Erie&quot; and were the only three s to be equipped for the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Program. &quot;Port Royal&quot; participated as a tracking ship during operation &quot;Stellar Athena&quot; FTM 12 on 22 June 2007 off Hawaii. &quot;Port Royal&quot;″s role has been taken by .

Originally, &quot;Port Royal&quot; was to be outfitted with the experimental shipboard mounted High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWEPS). Based on a megawatt-class deuterium/fluorine chemical laser, HELWEPS would have replaced the standard 5-inch forward gun. HELWEPS was to have been used to destroy missiles up to about away, or to burn out electro-optical sensors about away. The outfitting, scheduled to occur in Naval Base Ventura County, Port Hueneme, California in 1994 was cancelled, along with all plans to install HELWEPS on &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers.

Four (LM2500) gas turbine engines propel &quot;Port Royal&quot; with at speeds greater than . Two five-bladed controllable reversible pitch propellers ( diameter) and two rudders assist in acceleration and deceleration.

Sensors include:
* AN/SPY-1B(V) Multi-Function Radar (Four Mounts)
* AN/SPS-49(V)8 Air Search Radar
* AN/SPS-55 Surface Search Radar
* AN/SPS-64(V)9 Navigation Radar
* AN/SPQ-9 Gun Fire Control Radar
* AN/SPG-62 Illuminators (Four Mounts)
* AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Sonar Suite
* AN/SLQ-32A(V)3 Electronic Warfare Suite

==Operations==
&quot;Port Royal&quot; deployed from December 1995 until June 1996, as part of the battle group Carrier Group Seven. The CVBG was participating in Operation Southern Watch, but was deployed to the South China Sea in March 1996, to act as a stabilizing force the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. During this deployment, Captain Richards transferred command to Captain Gary Roughead on 21 January 1996. Following her first deployment, &quot;Port Royal&quot; became the first U.S. cruiser to integrate women into the crew.

&quot;Port Royal&quot; deployed with the &quot;Nimitz&quot; battle group for participation in Operation Southern Watch from September 1997 until March 1998.

&quot;Port Royal&quot; deployed with the &quot;&quot; battle group, participating in Operation Southern Watch. Leaving in January 2000, she returned to Hawaii early after sustaining damage to her port shaft and Hub during pursuit of a vessel suspected of smuggling Iraqi oil in violation of U.N. sanctions. She returned in June and then in August went into drydock for repairs and upgrades.

&quot;Port Royal&quot; deployed early Pearl Harbor on 17 November 2001, to join the &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; battle group on deployment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.

In March 2003, she was assigned to Carrier Group Seven.

&quot;Port Royal&quot; deployed with Expeditionary Strike Group-One (ESG-1) in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) from 3 September 2003 until 11 March 2004. This was the very first deployment of an Expeditionary Strike Group.

&quot;Port Royal&quot; deployed with &quot;Peleliu&quot; Expeditionary Strike Group-Three (ESG-3) in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) from 27 February 2006 until 5 August 2006.

On 6 January 2008, the destroyer &quot;Hopper&quot;, &quot;Port Royal&quot; and the frigate were entering the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz when five Iranian boats approached them at high speed and in a threatening manner. The U.S. ships had been in the Arabian Sea searching for a sailor who had been missing from &quot;Hopper&quot; for one day. The U.S. Navy says the Iranian boats made &quot;threatening&quot; moves toward the U.S. vessels, coming as close as . The U.S. Navy allegedly received a radio transmission saying, &quot;I am coming at you. You will explode in a couple of minutes.&quot; As the U.S. ships prepared to fire, the Iranians abruptly turned away, the U.S. officials said. Before leaving, the Iranians dropped white boxes into the water in front of the U.S. ships. The U.S. ships did not investigate the boxes. Officials from the two nations differed on the severity of the incident. The Iranians claimed they were conducting normal maneuvers while American officials claimed that an imminent danger to American naval vessels existed.

===2009 grounding===

On 5 February 2009, at 21:00, &quot;Port Royal&quot; ran aground about a half-mile south of the Honolulu International Airport&#x27;s Reef Runway. The ship had just come out of a dry dock after undergoing maintenance and was undergoing her first sea trials. No one was injured in the incident and no fuel was spilled. On 9 February 2009, &quot;Port Royal&quot; was pulled off the coral reef at around 2:00. No one was injured during the recovery effort, though damage to the reef was extensive, both from the ship&#x27;s hull and the cables used to drag the ship off the reef. Captain John Carroll was relieved of his duties and, along with the ship&#x27;s executive officer, commander Steven Okun and three other sailors, subsequently disciplined for dereliction of duty and improperly hazarding a vessel. Carroll had been the commanding officer of &quot;Port Royal&quot; since 23 October 2008. Rear Admiral Dixon R. Smith, who was aboard the ship, assumed temporary command on that day, and on 9 February, Captain John Lauer III, an official in Smith&#x27;s Naval Surface Group Middle Pacific, assumed command.

The warship suffered heavy damage to the underwater bow sonar dome and to her propellers and propeller shafts and was dry-docked for repairs. Captain Neil Parrott was assigned to preside over the investigation into the grounding. On 18 February, the ship entered Dry Dock Number 4 at Pearl Harbor. The navy estimated that repairs would cost between $25 and $40 million. The ship left dry dock on 24 September 2009 but needed several more weeks of repair and assessment before returning to duty.
===After the grounding===

In May 2013, to answer queries made by Congress, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) reported that the condition of the ship was comparable to certain other cruisers in the same class and that the effects of the grounding might not have been as severe as had been previously thought. A full report on the ship and her condition was anticipated in early August 2013. An April 2014 report by the GAO found that &quot;Port Royal&quot; was no more expensive to repair than other cruisers slated for retention.

===Deployments===
* 24 June 2011 – 13 February 2012 West PAC- Indian Ocean-Persian Gulf After repairs were effected, the cruiser departed on an eight-month deployment to the Western Pacific and Middle East but was forced to stop in Bahrain to have structural cracks repaired. Navy command was said to have lost confidence that the vessel had been restored to seaworthiness and, because of that, the ship was included on a list of seven cruisers slated for early retirement. Decommissioning in anticipation of eventual dismantlement was set for 31 March 2013.
* 25 August 2016 – 24 March 2017 West Pac-Indian Ocean-Persian Gulf On 24 March 2017, &quot;Port Royal&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor after a 212-day independent deployment to the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, South China Sea, Western Pacific, and Indian Ocean. During this time the ship conducted joint maritime security exercises with South East Asia partners, theatre anti-submarine operations, joint counterterrorism/smuggling exercises, Pacific presence operations in the South China Sea, 5th Fleet sector air defense, and carrier strike group operations with and . &quot;Port Royal&quot; also conducted straits transits, providing protection for U.S. and international commerce and projecting sea control in the vicinity of Yemen and Somalia.
* November 2020 – 27 April 2021 West LAC – Indian Ocean-Persian Gulf

* 10 January 10 2022 - 18 July 2022 - Western Pacific and Persian Gulf 

=== Decommissioning ===
In 2020, a U.S. Navy budget plan proposed putting &quot;Port Royal,&quot; as well as her sisters , , and , on a path to early decommissioning, as they had not been modernized.
In December 2020 the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Report to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels stated that the ship was planned to be placed Out of Commission in Reserve in 2022.

The ship was officially decommissioned at Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam, Hawaii on 29 September 2022 She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Registry on 30 September 2022. , her final disposition remains pending.

<text>The third USS &quot;Dolphin&quot; was the brig in the United States Navy. Her plans were the basis of other brigs of that time. She was named for the aquatic mammal.

She was launched on 17 June 1836 at New York Navy Yard, and commissioned on 6 September 1836. She sailed on 6 October under the command of Lieutenant W. E. McKenney to join the Brazil Squadron after a short cruise on the coast of Africa. She joined her squadron on 21 February 1837, and was employed in the waters along the Atlantic coast of South America to protect the rights and property of American citizens. She set sail from Bahia, Brazil on 17 April 1839, and arrived at New York City on 16 May, where she was decommissioned on 25 May.

&quot;Dolphin&quot; made two cruises off the coast of Africa to suppress the slave trade from 18 December 1839 to 14 July 1840, and again from 5 November 1840 to 25 May 1841. On 7 September, she sailed to join the newly-organized Home Squadron cruising on the Atlantic coast and in the West Indies. Aside from a repair period at New York from 31 December 1841 to 4 March 1842, she served with the Home Squadron until October 1843.

&quot;Dolphin&quot; lay at Norfolk, Virginia until 13 November 1845, when she sailed to join the African Squadron, returning to New York on 5 November 1847. She got underway on 6 May 1848 to join the East India Squadron, protecting American citizens in Asiatic waters. She called at the Island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean to repair damage suffered during a gale and arrived at Whampoa, China in February 1849. &quot;Dolphin&quot; cruised in Chinese waters until 22 July 1850, when she sailed for New York by way of the California coast and Cape Horn, arriving on 24 June 1851.

Out of commission at New York until 10 September 1852, &quot;Dolphin&quot; put to sea on 30 September on a special cruise to test and perfect discoveries made by Lieutenant M. F. Maury in his investigation of the winds and currents of the ocean, sailing as far as the English Channel. She arrived at Hampton Roads on 12 November 1853, then returned to New York, where she was placed in ordinary during 1854.

Recommissioned at Norfolk on 23 April 1855, &quot;Dolphin&quot; put to sea on 8 May for another African cruise. She arrived on station 16 June and patrolled to suppress the slave trade until 28 June 1857, when she stood out for the United States, arriving at Boston, Massachusetts on 21 July. She went out of commission on 27 July.

Placed back in commission she cruised in the West Indies to intercept slave ships between June and September 1858. On 21 August she captured the slave ship with 318 Africans on board and sent her into Charleston, South Carolina. Those thus saved from slavery were later sent back to Africa on the .

&quot;Dolphin&quot; sailed from Boston on 16 October 1858 for duty on the Brazil Station, taking part in the Paraguay expedition to obtain redress for Paraguay&#x27;s unprovoked firing upon the American ship and to settle diplomatic difficulties from December 1858 to February 1859. &quot;Dolphin&quot; returned to Norfolk on 22 December 1860 and was laid up at the Navy Yard. She was burned there on 21 April 1861 by Union forces to prevent her from falling into Confederate hands.

<text>Poole () is a coastal town and seaport on the south coast of England in the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole unitary authority area in Dorset, England. The town is east of Dorchester and adjoins Bournemouth to the east. Since 1 April 2019, the local authority is Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council. The town had an estimated population of 151,500 (mid-2016 census estimates) making it the second-largest town in the ceremonial county of Dorset. Together with Bournemouth and Christchurch, the conurbation has a total population of nearly 400,000.

The settlement dates back to before the Iron Age. The earliest recorded use of the town&#x27;s name was in the 12th century when the town began to emerge as an important port, prospering with the introduction of the wool trade. Later, the town had important trade links with North America and, at its peak during the 18th century, it was one of the busiest ports in Britain. In the Second World War, Poole was one of the main departing points for the Normandy landings.

Poole is a tourist resort, attracting visitors with its large natural harbour, history, the Lighthouse arts centre and Blue Flag beaches. The town has a commercial port with cross-Channel freight and passenger ferry services, which connect with the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey, as well as the French port town of Saint-Malo, Brittany.

The headquarters of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) is in Poole, and the Royal Marines have a base in the town&#x27;s harbour. Despite their names, Poole is the home of The Arts University Bournemouth, the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and a significant part of Bournemouth University.

==History==

The area around modern Poole has been inhabited for at least the past 2,500 years, with nearby Christchurch Harbour evidencing human activity dating back to the Neolithic period at Hengistbury Head. During the 3rd century BC, Celtic-speaking people known as the Durotriges moved from hilltop settlements at Maiden Castle and Badbury Rings to heathland around the River Frome and Poole Harbour. The Romans landed at Poole during their conquest of Britain in the 1st century and took over an Iron Age settlement at Hamworthy, an area just west of the modern town centre. This was used as a supply base for the fortress at Lake Farm, Ashington and a settlement at Vindocladia (Bradbury Rings).

The town&#x27;s name may have originated around the post-Roman or Anglo-Saxon periods, and seems to have originally applied to the harbour. It is derived from the late Brittonic or early Old English words &quot;pol&quot; meaning a pool or creek.

By the middle to late Anglo-Saxon period, Poole was included in the Kingdom of Wessex. The settlement was used as a base for fishing and the harbour a place for ships to anchor on their way to the River Frome and the important Anglo-Saxon town of Wareham. Poole experienced two large-scale Viking invasions during this era: in 876, Guthrum sailed his fleet through the harbour to attack Wareham, and in 1015, Canute began his conquest of England in Poole Harbour, using it as a base to raid and pillage Wessex.

Following the Norman conquest of England, Poole rapidly grew into a busy port as the importance of Wareham declined. The town was part of the manor of Canford but does not exist as an identifiable entry in the Domesday Book. The earliest written mention of Poole occurred on a document from 1196 describing the newly built St James&#x27;s Chapel in &quot;La Pole&quot;. The Lord of the Manor, Sir William Longspée, sold a charter of liberties to the burgesses of Poole in 1248 to raise funds for his participation in the Seventh Crusade. Consequently, Poole gained a small measure of freedom from feudal rule and acquired the right to appoint a mayor and hold a court within the town. Poole&#x27;s growing importance was recognised in 1433 when it was awarded staple port status by King Henry VI, enabling the port to begin exporting wool and in turn granting a licence for the construction of a town wall. In 1568, Poole gained further autonomy when it was granted legal independence from Dorset and made a county corporate by the Great Charter of Elizabeth I. During the English Civil War, Poole&#x27;s puritan stance and its merchants&#x27; opposition to the ship money tax introduced by King Charles I led to the town declaring for Parliament. Poole escaped any large-scale attack and with the Royalists on the brink of defeat in 1646, the Parliamentary garrison from Poole laid siege to and captured the nearby Royalist stronghold at Corfe Castle.

Poole established successful commerce with the North American colonies in the 16th century, including the important fisheries of Newfoundland. Trade with Newfoundland grew steadily to meet the demand for fish from the Catholic countries of Europe. Poole&#x27;s share of this trade varied but the most prosperous period started in the early 18th century and lasted until the early 19th century. The trade followed a three-cornered route; ships sailed to Newfoundland with salt and provisions, then carried dried and salted fish to Europe before returning to Poole with wine, olive oil, and salt. By the early 18th century Poole had more ships trading with North America than any other English port and vast wealth was brought to Poole&#x27;s merchants. This prosperity supported much of the development which now characterises the Old Town where many of the medieval buildings were replaced with Georgian mansions and terraced housing. The end of the Napoleonic Wars and the conclusion of the War of 1812 ended Britain&#x27;s monopoly over the Newfoundland fisheries and other nations took over services provided by Poole&#x27;s merchants at a lower cost. Poole&#x27;s Newfoundland trade rapidly declined and within a decade most merchants had ceased trading.

The town grew rapidly during the Industrial Revolution as urbanisation took place and the town became an area of mercantile prosperity and overcrowded poverty. At the turn of the 19th century, nine out of ten workers were engaged in harbour activities, but as the century progressed, ships became too large for the shallow harbour and the port lost business to the deepwater ports at Liverpool, Southampton and Plymouth. Poole&#x27;s first railway station opened in Hamworthy in 1847 and later extended to the centre of Poole in 1872, effectively ending the port&#x27;s busy coastal shipping trade. The beaches and landscape of southern Dorset and south-west Hampshire began to attract tourists during the 19th century and the villages to the east of Poole began to grow and merge until the seaside resort of Bournemouth emerged. Although Poole did not become a resort, like many of its neighbours, it continued to prosper as the rapid expansion of Bournemouth created a large demand for goods manufactured in Poole.

During World War II, Poole was the third-largest embarkation point for D-Day landings of Operation Overlord and afterwards served as a base for supplies to the allied forces in Europe. Eighty-one landing craft containing American troops from the 29th Infantry Division and the US Army Rangers departed Poole Harbour for Omaha Beach. Poole was also an important centre for the development of Combined Operations and the base for a US Coast Guard rescue flotilla of 60 cutters. Much of the town suffered from German bombing during the war - in which the Municipal Borough lost 75 civilian lives - and years of neglect in the post-war economic decline. Major redevelopment projects began in the 1950s and 1960s and large areas of slum properties were demolished and replaced with modern public housing and facilities. Many of Poole&#x27;s historic buildings were demolished during this period, particularly in the Old Town area of Poole. Consequently, a Conservation Area was created in the town centre in 1975 to preserve Poole&#x27;s most notable buildings. The Poole explosion of 1988 caused 3,500 people to be evacuated out of the town centre in the biggest peacetime evacuation the country had seen since the World War II.

==Governance==

There is one tier of local government covering Poole, at unitary authority level: Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, which is based at the Civic Centre in Bournemouth.

===Administrative history===

Poole was an ancient borough, which lay within the ancient parish of Canford Magna. The borough acquired its first charter in 1248 from William Longespée, who was lord of the manor. A chapel of ease dedicated to St James existed at Poole from at least 1142. In 1538, the borough was removed from the parish of Canford Magna to become its own parish, called Poole St James.

In 1568, Poole was given the right to appoint its own sheriff, making it a county corporate, independent from the jurisdiction of the Sheriff of Dorset.

In 1836, Poole was reformed to become a municipal borough. As part of that reform, the borough boundaries were enlarged to take in Hamworthy, Longfleet and Parkstone.
When elected county councils were established in 1889, despite being a county corporate, Poole was not considered large enough for the borough council to take on county council functions. It was therefore included in the administrative county of Dorset under the new Dorset County Council. The borough boundaries were enlarged in 1905 to take in Branksome, and again in 1931 to absorb Canford Magna. In 1932 the borough council built itself Poole Civic Centre on Parkstone Road to serve as its headquarters.

The borough of Poole was reconstituted as a non-metropolitan district in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The district kept the same boundaries and its borough status, but there were some changes to the council&#x27;s responsibilities.

In 1997, Poole Borough Council became a unitary authority, taking over the provision of county council functions from Dorset County Council.

The borough of Poole was abolished in 2019, merging with the boroughs of Bournemouth and Christchurch to become a new local government district called Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, the council of which is a unitary authority. The Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole district remains part of the ceremonial county of Dorset for the purposes of lieutenancy.

Since the abolition of Poole Borough Council in 2019, Poole has had charter trustees, being the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole councillors representing wards in the former borough of Poole. The trustees preserve the town&#x27;s civic charters and traditions, including appointing one of their number each year to serve as mayor and another to serve as sheriff; these roles are now purely honorary with no practical functions. Poole is one of only fifteen towns and cities across England and Wales which appoint their own sheriff, with Poole&#x27;s right to do so stemming from its former status as a county corporate.

===Parliamentary representation===
Poole is represented by three parliamentary constituencies in the House of Commons; Poole, Mid Dorset and North Poole, and Bournemouth West. The borough constituency of Poole has existed since 1950. Previously the town had been a parliamentary borough, electing two members of parliament from 1455 until 1865 when representation was reduced to one member. In 1885 the constituency was abolished altogether and absorbed into the East Dorset constituency until its reintroduction in 1950.

===Coat of arms===
The design of the coat of arms originated in a seal from the late 14th century and were recorded by Clarenceux King of Arms during the heraldic visitation of Dorset in 1563. The wavy bars of black and gold represent the sea and the dolphin is a sign of Poole&#x27;s maritime interests. The scallop shells are the emblem of Saint James and are associated with his shrine at Santiago de Compostela – a popular destination for Christian pilgrims departing from Poole Harbour in the Middle Ages.

The arms were confirmed by the College of Arms on 19 June 1948, and at the same time, the crest (a mermaid supporting an anchor and holding a cannonball) was granted. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, the 1948 arms were transferred to Poole Borough Council. In 1976, the council received the grant of supporters for the coat of arms. The supporters refer to important charters given to the town; to the left is a gold lion holding a long sword representing William Longespee who in 1248 granted the town&#x27;s first charter; on the right is a dragon derived from the Royal Arms of Elizabeth I who granted Poole county corporate status in 1568. The Latin motto – &quot;Ad Morem Villae De Poole&quot;, means: &quot;According to the Custom of the Town of Poole&quot;, and derives from the Great Charter of 1568.

==Geography==
Poole is a complex shore of the English Channel; it lies on the northern and eastern edges of Poole Harbour, west-southwest of London. The oldest part of the town (including the historic Old Town, Poole Quay and the Dolphin Shopping Centre) lies to the south-east of Holes Bay on a peninsula jutting into the harbour, although much of the land to the east of the peninsula has been reclaimed from the harbour since the mid-20th century. To the west is Upton and Corfe Mullen and across the northern border at the River Stour lies Wimborne Minster. At the eastern edge of Poole, the town abuts Bournemouth and the settlements of Kinson, Winton and Westbourne. To the south of Poole along the coast lies Poole Bay, which has of sandy beaches from Sandbanks in the west to Bournemouth in the east.

Urban areas and districts of the town
Poole is made up of numerous suburbs and neighbourhoods, many of which developed from villages or hamlets that were absorbed into Poole as the town grew.
Alderney – Bearwood – Branksome – Branksome Park – Broadstone – Canford Cliffs – Canford Heath – Creekmoor – Fleetsbridge – Hamworthy – Lilliput – Longfleet – Merley – Oakley – Newtown – Oakdale – Parkstone – Penn Hill – Sandbanks – Sterte – Talbot Village – Wallisdown – Waterloo – Whitecliff
The natural environment of Poole is characterised by lowland heathland to the north and wooded chines and coastline to the south. The heathland habitat supports the six native British reptile species and provides a home for a range of dragonflies and rare birds. Development has destroyed much of the heath but scattered fragments remain to the north of Poole and have been designated Special Protection Areas. The town lies on unresistant beds of Eocene clays (mainly London Clay and Gault Clay), sands and gravels. The River Frome runs through this weak rock, and its many tributaries have carved out a wide estuary. At the mouth of the estuary sand spits have been deposited, enclosing the estuary to create Poole Harbour.

The harbour is the largest natural harbour in Europe and the second-largest natural harbour in the world after Sydney Harbour. It is an area of international importance for nature conservation and is noted for its ecology, supporting salt marshes, mudflats and an internationally important habitat for several species of migrating bird. It has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a Special Protection Area and a Ramsar site as well as falling within the Dorset National Landscape area. The harbour covers an area of and is extremely shallow. The main shipping channels are deep the average depth of the harbour is . It contains several small islands, the largest is Brownsea Island, a nature reserve owned by the National Trust and the birthplace of the Scouting movement and location of the first Scout Camp. Britain&#x27;s largest onshore oil field operates from Wytch Farm on the south shore of the harbour. The oil reservoirs extend under the harbour and eastwards from Sandbanks and Studland for under the sea to the south of Bournemouth.

Situated directly to the east of the Jurassic Coast, Poole is a gateway town to the UNESCO World Heritage Site, which includes of the Dorset and east Devon coast important for its geology, landforms and rich fossil record. The South West Coast Path stretches for from Minehead in Somerset, along the coast of Devon and Cornwall and on to Poole. The path is England&#x27;s longest national trail.

===Climate===
Due to its location on the south coast of England, Poole has a temperate climate with a small variation in daily and annual temperatures. The average annual mean temperature from 1971 to 2000 was . The warmest months in Poole are July and August, which have an average temperature range of , and the coolest months are January and February, which have a range of . Mean sea surface temperatures range from in February to in August. The average annual rainfall of is well below the UK average of .

=== Green belt ===

Poole lies at the centre of a green belt region that extends into the wider surrounding counties. It is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the South East Dorset conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.

Poole has areas of green belt to the north and west of the district, mostly on the fringes of the shared border with the Purbeck and East Dorset districts. These cover landscape features and greenfield facilities including the rivers Stour and Sherford and their floodplains, the Stour Valley Way, Canford Heathland, Dunyeats Hill and Corfe and Barrow Hill nature reserves, Upton Country Park, Pergins Island, and the Wimborne District Society of Model Engineers miniature railway.

The small communities at Merley, Canford Magna, Oakley and Oakley Hill are separated from the main urban area, and while inset, are not covered by green belt. However, the isolated hamlets of Knighton, Merley Hall and Ashington are &#x27;washed over&#x27;, and development is limited in these locations. A specific function of the restrictions is to prevent further urban encroachment towards Wimborne Minster, to help maintain its historic character and surroundings.

==Demographics==


Poole merges with several other towns to form the South East Dorset conurbation which has a combined population of over 465,000, forming one of the South Coast&#x27;s major urban areas. In the 2011 census, the population of the borough of Poole was 147,645, an increase from 138,288 in 2001. The town has a built-up area of , giving an approximate population density of in 60,512 dwellings. The population has grown steadily since the 1960s, inward migration has accounted for most of the town&#x27;s growth and a significant part of this has been for retirement. Housing stock has increased by over 100 per cent in the past 40 years from 30,000 in 1961 to approximately 62,700 in 2004. Compared to the rest of England and Wales, Poole has an above-average number of residents aged over 65 (20.3%), but this is less than the Dorset average of 22.2%. The largest proportion of the population (24.8%) is between the ages of 45 to 64, slightly above the national average of 23.8%. Population projections have predicted a continual growth; a population of 151,481 is estimated by 2016.

The district is overwhelmingly populated by people of a White ethnic background, 95.98% of residents are of White British ethnicity, well above the rest of England at 86.99%. Minority ethnic groups (including those in White ethnic groups who did not classify themselves as British) represent 4.0% of Poole&#x27;s population. The largest religion in Poole is Christianity, at almost 74.34%, slightly above the United Kingdom average of 71.6%. The next-largest sector is those with no religion, at almost 16.23%, also above the UK average of 15.5%.

The average house price in Poole is high compared to the rest of the UK and the surrounding south-west region. The average price of a property in Poole in 2008 was £274,011; detached houses were on average £374,150, semi-detached and terraced houses were cheaper at £226,465 and £217,128 respectively. An apartment or flat costs on average £216,097, more than any other part of Dorset. The average house prices in Poole are boosted by those in Sandbanks which had the fourth-most expensive house prices in the world in 2000; in 2007 the average house price was £488,761. A study in 2006 by the National Housing Federation reported that Poole was the most unaffordable town in which to live in the UK.

==Economy==
Poole&#x27;s economy is more balanced than the rest of Dorset. In the 1960s, prosperity was fuelled by growth in the manufacturing sector, whereas the 1980s and 1990s saw expansion in the service sector as office-based employers relocated to the area. The importance of manufacturing has declined since the 1960s but still employed approximately 17% of the workforce in 2002 and remains more prominent than in the economy of Great Britain as a whole. Sunseeker, the world&#x27;s largest privately owned builder of motor yachts and the UK&#x27;s largest manufacturer, is based in Poole and employs over 1,800 people in its Poole shipyards. Other major employers in the local manufacturing industry include Lush, Siemens and Ryvita. Poole has the largest number of industrial estates in South East Dorset, including the Nuffield Industrial estate, Mannings Heath, Arena Business Park, Poole Trade Park and the Branksome Business Centre.

The service sector is the principal economy of Poole; a large number of employees work for the service economy of residents or for tourists. During the 1970s, Poole&#x27;s less restrictive regional planning policies attracted businesses wishing to relocate from London. These included employers in the banking and financial sector, such as Barclays Bank (who operated Barclays House as a regional headquarters in Poole), American Express Bank and the corporate trust division of Bank of New York Mellon. Other important service sector employers include the national headquarters and college of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), the UK headquarters of Fitness First, Bournemouth University and Arts University Bournemouth. Poole is also the headquarters for clothing company Animal, cosmetics manufacturer Lush, and Merlin Entertainments, the world&#x27;s second-largest theme park operator after Disney. The Dolphin Shopping Centre is Poole&#x27;s main retail area and the largest indoor shopping centre in Dorset. It opened in 1969 as an Arndale Centre and underwent three major refurbishments in 1980, 1989 and 2004. The centre provides of retail space with 110 stores and two multi-storey car parks with 1,400 parking spaces. A pedestrianised high street with shops, bars, pubs and restaurants connects the Dolphin Centre with the historic Old Town area and Poole Quay. Tourism is important to the Poole&#x27;s economy and was worth an estimated £158 million in 2002. Poole&#x27;s Harbour, Quay and the beaches are some of the main attractions for visitors. Visitor accommodation consists of hotels, guest houses and bed and breakfast rooms located around the town, particularly in Sandbanks and the town centre.

Poole is served by the Port of Poole. Since the 1970s, Poole has become one of Britain&#x27;s busiest ports. Investment in new port facilities in Hamworthy and the deepening of shipping channels allowed considerable growth in cross-channel freight and passenger traffic. The port is a destination for bulk cargo imports such as steel, timber, bricks, fertiliser, grain, aggregates and palletised traffic. Export cargoes include clay, sand, fragmented steel and grain. Commercial ferry operators run regular passenger and freight services from Poole to Cherbourg, St Malo and the Channel Islands. The Royal Marines operate out of the harbour at RM Poole, established in Hamworthy in 1954. The base is home to special forces unit the Special Boat Service and a detachment of the Royal Marines Reserve. In 2008, 105 fishing boats were registered and licensed to the port and held a permit issued by the Southern Sea Fisheries District Committee (SSFDC) to fish commercially. It is the largest port in terms of licences in the SSFDC district which covers the coastline of Dorset, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, and one of the largest registered fishing fleets in the UK. However, the fleet is gradually declining because of rising fuel costs and restrictive fishing quotas introduced by the European Union.

Poole Quay is a visitor attraction to the south of the town centre lined with a mixture of traditional pubs and listed buildings alongside new bars, redeveloped warehouses and apartment blocks. Once the busy centre of Poole&#x27;s maritime industry, all port activities moved to Hamworthy in the 1970s as the Quay became increasingly popular with tourists. The Grade II* listed Customs House on the quay-front was built in 1814 and now functions as a restaurant and bar. Nearby the Grade I listed Town Cellars, a medieval warehouse built in the 15th century on the foundations of a 14th-century stone building, houses a local history centre. Scaplen&#x27;s Court, another Grade I listed building, also dates from the medieval era. Poole Pottery has been redeveloped into an apartment block. Boats regularly depart from the quay during the summer and provide cruises around the harbour and to Brownsea Island, the River Frome and Swanage. Public artworks along the Quay include &quot;Sea Music&quot; – a large metal sculpture designed by Sir Anthony Caro, and a life-size bronze sculpture of Robert Baden-Powell created to celebrate the founding of the Scout Movement on Brownsea Island. At the western end of the quay, near the mouth of Holes Bay, is Poole Bridge. Built in 1927, it is the third bridge to be located on the site since 1834.

Poole Guildhall has played a varied part in the history of the town. A Grade II* listed building, the Guildhall was built in 1761 at a cost of £2,250. The new building included an open market house on the ground floor and a courtroom and offices for the town council on the first floor and has also been used as a court of record, magistrates&#x27; court, court of admiralty and a venue for quarter sessions. Between 1819 and 1821 the building was consecrated as a parish church while the old St. James Church was pulled down and replaced with the present church. During the Second World War, the building was used as a canteen and meeting room for American soldiers before the invasion of France. The showers and washing facilities installed at this time were later converted into public baths which were used until the 1960s. The building was converted for use as the town museum between 1971 and 1991 but stood empty for the next 16 years. After a renovation project funded by Poole Borough Council, the restored Guildhall opened in June 2007 as a Register Office for weddings, civil partnerships and other civic ceremonies.
Poole has several urban parks – the largest is Poole Park adjacent to Poole Harbour and the town centre. It opened in 1890 and is one of two Victorian parks in Poole. Designated a Conservation Area in 1995 and awarded a Green Flag in 2008, the park comprises of which include the park&#x27;s human-made lake and ponds. The park contains two children&#x27;s play areas, a miniature railway, tennis courts, a bowling green, a miniature golf course, an Italian restaurant and an indoor ice rink for children. A cricket field and pavilion at the eastern end are home to Poole Town Cricket Club and water sport activities such as sailing, windsurfing, kayaking and rowing take place on the large lake. A war memorial stands in the centre of the park as a monument to Poole citizens killed during the First and Second World Wars. The park hosts several road races such as the Race for Life and the annual Poole Festival of Running.

The Grade II* St James&#x27; Church is a simplified Gothic Revival style Church of England parish church in the Old Town which was rebuilt in 1820. The previous church on the site was first mentioned in documents from 1142 and had been extensively rebuilt in the 16th century, but in 1819 it was deemed structurally unsafe by a surveyors report. The United Reformed Church hall, also in the town centre, is a Grade II* building built in 1777. The other Grade II* churches are: St. Peter&#x27;s Parish Church in Parkstone which was first built in 1833 and replaced in 1876; St Dunstan of Canterbury Orthodox Church, also in Parkstone, an Antiochian Orthodox church, formerly the Anglican Church of St Osmund, in a Neo-Byzantine style building; and the Parish Church of St. Aldhelm in Branksome, built by the architects Bodley and Garner in 1892 in the Gothic Revival style. Described by English Heritage as &quot;one of Poole&#x27;s most important landmarks&quot;, the Gothic Revival church of St Mary&#x27;s in Longfleet, built in 1833, is one of Poole&#x27;s Grade II listed churches.

==Culture==

The &#x27;Beating of the bounds&#x27; is an ancient annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the traditional checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the Cinque Port of Winchelsea in 1364. The Admiral of the Port of Poole (the mayor) and other dignitaries, and members of the public sail from the mouth of the River Frome to Old Harry Rocks to confirm the mayor&#x27;s authority over the water boundaries of the harbour and check for any encroachments. As there are no physical landmarks that can be beaten at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember the bounds of their town by taking part in the &#x27;Pins and Points&#x27; ceremony involving the beating of a boy and pricking of a girl&#x27;s hand with a needle. In modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.

Poole&#x27;s &quot;Summertime in the South&quot; is an annual programme providing various events on Poole Quay and Sandbanks from May until September. During June and July, live music, street entertainment and a large firework display take place on Poole Quay every Thursday evening. In August, the entertainment moves to the beaches at Sandbanks.

<text>This article contains information about the literary events and publications of 1826.

==Events==
*Early months – Aftermath of the Decembrist revolt in the Russian Empire. Michael Lunin, though not involved in the Decembrist conspiracy, is arrested and deported to Siberia, which allows him to begin his work as a philosopher. Adam Mickiewicz, deported from Congress Poland for his involvement with Filaret Association, is moved from Taurida Governorate to Moscow. Here, he publishes his &quot;Sonety krymskie&quot; (The Crimean Sonnets). Later in the year, he befriends Russian writers, including Yevgeny Baratynsky, Mikhail Pogodin, Alexander Pushkin, and the &quot;Lyubomudry&quot;. Pushkin, himself returning from political exile, still writes poems discreetly honoring the Decembrists. They include &quot;Stansy&quot; (Stanzas), as well as odes to Nikolay Mordvinov and Ivan Pushchin.
*c. January – Japanese poet Kobayashi Issa, pained by his recent divorce, enters his final creative period with &quot;hokku&quot; expressing his solitude and, at times, nihilistic thoughts.
*January 15 – The French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; begins publication in Paris. In this first edition, it is a satirical weekly, reflecting the preoccupation of its two founders, Maurice Alhoy and Étienne Arago.
*January 17 – The Ballantyne printing business in Edinburgh crashes, ruining Sir Walter Scott as a principal investor. He undertakes to repay his creditors from his writings, although his publisher Archibald Constable also fails. Distress caused by the events contributes to the illness afflicting Scott&#x27;s wife, Lady Charlotte; she dies in May.
*February 4 – In the Mexican Republic, lithographer Claudio Linati inaugurates &quot;El Iris&quot;, a &quot;pocket sized&quot; bi-weekly. It is in print until August 2, when its popularization of liberal ideas prompts the intervention of state censors; Linati leaves Mexico later in the year, probably for political reasons.
*February 6 
**First printing of James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;. This is Cooper&#x27;s first book under contract with Philadelphia publishers Mathew Carey and Isaac Lea, following Charles Wiley&#x27;s near-bankruptcy and death. It endures as &quot;the most popular novel of the 1820s.&quot;
**Charles L. Force brings printing to the Colony of Liberia and, ten days later, founds the bi-weekly &quot;Liberia Herald&quot;. Force dies later this year, but his publication is revived in 1830 by John Brown Russwurm.
*February 16 (O. S.: February 4) – Hungarian Serbs gather at Pest to set up &quot;Matica srpska&quot;, a cultural society dedicated to promoting the works of Serb writers. It sponsors Georgije Magarašević&#x27;s &quot;Serbski Letopis&quot;, which remained &quot;one of Europe&#x27;s oldest, regularly published journals.&quot;
*March – Aged eight, the future orator and memoirist Frederick Douglass is lent by his master to the Aulds of Fell&#x27;s Point, Baltimore. He will remain their house servant, and later their regular slave, until 1838, when he escapes via the Underground Railroad.
*April – Andrés Bello launches his London magazine &quot;Repertorio Americano&quot;, in which he publishes the final installment of his &quot;Las Silvas Americanas&quot;, known as &quot;Silva a la agricultura de la zona tórrida&quot; (&quot;Silva&quot; for Agriculture in the Torrid Zone). It is sometimes described as a final masterpiece of Neoclassicism in Latin American literature.
*April 16 – Thomas Pringle, a founding figure of South African literature, embarks on his return trip to England. His stay in the Cape Colony leads him to join and publicize for the Anti-Slavery Society.
*May 18 – At Buda, Habsburg Hungary, Wallachian intellectual Dinicu Golescu receives &quot;imprimatur&quot; for his &quot;Însemnare a călătoriei mele&quot; (Accounts of My Travels). This pioneering travelog covers extensive trips in Central and Western Europe, which Golescu had begun in 1824. The author documents his own &quot;amazed &#x27;discovery&#x27; of the West [and] acceptance of his country&#x27;s admitted inferiority.&quot; As a &quot;manifesto for the new culture&quot; &quot;Însemnare&quot; promotes Wallachia&#x27;s passage into the Age of Enlightenment. For the same purpose Golescu sponsors a school on his estate.
*June – Despite having maintained links with the Decembrists, poet Alexander Griboyedov receives a &quot;certificate of loyalism&quot; from the Russian government.

*July 25 (O.S.: July 13) – Five Decembrist leaders, including poet Kondraty Ryleyev, are hanged in Senate Square, Saint Petersburg. Pushkin&#x27;s papers of the time include a drawing of five silhouettes on a scaffold, with the words: &quot;Me too, I could be...&quot;.
*August 19 – Louis Christophe François Hachette purchases the Brédif bookshop on rue Pierre-Sarrazin, Paris. This becomes the first asset owned by the Hachette publishing company.
*September – The first issue of Lydia Maria Child&#x27;s &quot;The Juvenile Miscellany&quot;, a magazine for children, is published in Boston. Becoming &quot;so popular that children used to sit on their doorsteps waiting for the mail carrier to deliver it,&quot; it lasts until 1834.
*October – Tyrone Power gets his break as a principal Irish character actor at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden in London.
*October 17 – Thomas Carlyle and Jane Welsh marry in Templand and setup home in Edinburgh.
*Late months – First recorded usage of &quot;Quixotism&quot; in Greek (as Δονκιχωτισμός), in a letter from John Caradja to Alexandros Mavrokordatos.
*November
**Hungarian philologist Sándor Kőrösi Csoma ends his stay at Teta, on the outskirts of Phugtal Monastery in Ladakh.
**The London Missionary Society sets up the first printing press in Madagascar (Merina Kingdom). It survives to 1836, being ultimately shut down for political reasons.
*December – At Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, Henry Schoolcraft sets up a review called &quot;Literary Voyager, or Muzzeniegan&quot;. It includes poems and stories by his part-Ojibwe wife, Jane Johnston Schoolcraft, who thus becomes one of the first Native American literary professionals.
*December 5 (O. S.: November 23) – From his boarding school in Nezhin, Chernigov Governorate, Nikolai Gogol writes home to his mother, describing a &quot;radical new change&quot; in his poetic style. Only two pieces he wrote during this period have survived for posterity.
*c. December 25 – Edgar Allan Poe is forced to renounce his studies at the University of Virginia when his foster parent John Allan refuses to pay for his tuition.
*&quot;unknown dates&quot;
**Almeida Garrett issues the poetry anthology &quot;Parnaso lusitano&quot; (Lusitanian Parnassus), which is both a milestone of Romanticism in Lusophone countries and a cause for debates regarding the emergence of a distinct Brazilian literature. The latter issue is also explored by French historian Jean-Ferdinand Denis, who includes an epilogue on &quot;Brazil&#x27;s literary history&quot; to his Portuguese literature tract.
**Robert Morrison, missionary and Bible translator, returns from Malacca to England &quot;with 10,000 Chinese books.&quot;
**Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat, who puts out the &quot;Mélanges Asiatiques&quot; collection, publishes his translation of a Chinese classic: &quot;Iu-Kiao-Li, ou Les Deux Cousines&quot;.
**Francesco Vella puts out a translation of Francesco Soave&#x27;s &quot;Trattato elementare dei doveri dell&#x27;uomo (Trattat fuk l&#x27;Oblighi tal-Bniedem tal-Patri F. Soave)&quot;, as a textbook for Gozo College Boys&#x27; Secondary School. It is one of the first prose works published in the Maltese language.

<doc id="207472" wikidata="Q3295108" url="?curid=207472" title="Medium access control">
<text>In IEEE 802 LAN/MAN standards, the medium access control (MAC), also called media access control, is the layer that controls the hardware responsible for interaction with the wired (electrical or optical) or wireless transmission medium. The MAC sublayer and the logical link control (LLC) sublayer together make up the data link layer. The LLC provides flow control and multiplexing for the logical link (i.e. EtherType, 802.1Q VLAN tag etc), while the MAC provides flow control and multiplexing for the transmission medium.

These two sublayers together correspond to layer 2 of the OSI model. For compatibility reasons, LLC is optional for implementations of IEEE 802.3 (the frames are then &quot;raw&quot;), but compulsory for implementations of other IEEE 802 physical layer standards. Within the hierarchy of the OSI model and IEEE 802 standards, the MAC sublayer provides a control abstraction of the physical layer such that the complexities of physical link control are invisible to the LLC and upper layers of the network stack. Thus any LLC sublayer (and higher layers) may be used with any MAC. In turn, the medium access control block is formally connected to the PHY via a media-independent interface. Although the MAC block is today typically integrated with the PHY within the same device package, historically any MAC could be used with any PHY, independent of the transmission medium.

When sending data to another device on the network, the MAC sublayer encapsulates higher-level frames into frames appropriate for the transmission medium (i.e. the MAC adds a syncword preamble and also padding if necessary), adds a frame check sequence to identify transmission errors, and then forwards the data to the physical layer as soon as the appropriate channel access method permits it. For topologies with a collision domain (bus, ring, mesh, point-to-multipoint topologies), controlling when data is sent and when to wait is necessary to avoid collisions. Additionally, the MAC is also responsible for compensating for collisions by initiating retransmission if a jam signal is detected. When receiving data from the physical layer, the MAC block ensures data integrity by verifying the sender&#x27;s frame check sequences, and strips off the sender&#x27;s preamble and padding before passing the data up to the higher layers.

== Functions performed in the MAC sublayer ==

According to IEEE Std 802-2001 section 6.2.3 &quot;MAC sublayer&quot;, the primary functions performed by the MAC layer are:

* Frame delimiting and recognition
* Addressing of destination stations (both as individual stations and as groups of stations)
* Conveyance of source-station addressing information
* Transparent data transfer of LLC PDUs, or of equivalent information in the Ethernet sublayer
* Protection against errors, generally by means of generating and checking frame check sequences
* Control of access to the physical transmission medium

In the case of Ethernet, the functions required of a MAC are:

* receive/transmit normal frames
* half-duplex retransmission and backoff functions
* append/check FCS (frame check sequence)
* interframe gap enforcement
* discard malformed frames
* prepend(tx)/remove(rx) preamble, SFD (start frame delimiter), and padding
* half-duplex compatibility: append(tx)/remove(rx) MAC address

== Addressing mechanism ==
The local network addresses used in IEEE 802 networks and FDDI networks are called &quot;MAC addresses&quot;; they are based on the addressing scheme that was used in early Ethernet implementations. A MAC address is intended as a unique serial number. MAC addresses are typically assigned to network interface hardware at the time of manufacture. The most significant part of the address identifies the manufacturer, who assigns the remainder of the address, thus providing a potentially unique address. This makes it possible for frames to be delivered on a network link that interconnects hosts by some combination of repeaters, hubs, bridges and switches, but not by network layer routers. Thus, for example, when an IP packet reaches its destination (sub)network, the destination IP address (a layer 3 or network layer concept) is resolved with the Address Resolution Protocol for IPv4, or by Neighbor Discovery Protocol (IPv6) into the MAC address (a layer 2 concept) of the destination host.

Examples of physical networks are Ethernet networks and Wi-Fi networks, both of which are IEEE 802 networks and use IEEE 802 48-bit MAC addresses.

A MAC layer is not required in full-duplex point-to-point communication, but address fields are included in some point-to-point protocols for compatibility reasons.

== Channel access control mechanism ==
The channel access control mechanisms provided by the MAC layer are also known as a multiple access method. This makes it possible for several stations connected to the same physical medium to share it. Examples of shared physical media are bus networks, ring networks, hub networks, wireless networks and half-duplex point-to-point links. The multiple access method may detect or avoid data packet collisions if a packet mode contention based channel access method is used, or reserve resources to establish a logical channel if a circuit-switched or channelization-based channel access method is used. The channel access control mechanism relies on a physical layer multiplex scheme.

The most widespread multiple access method is the contention-based CSMA/CD used in Ethernet networks. This mechanism is only utilized within a network collision domain, for example, an Ethernet bus network or a hub-based star topology network. An Ethernet network may be divided into several collision domains, interconnected by bridges and switches.
A multiple access method is not required in a switched full-duplex network, such as today&#x27;s switched Ethernet networks, but is often available in the equipment for compatibility reasons.

=== Channel access control mechanism for concurrent transmission ===
Use of directional antennas and millimeter-wave communication in a wireless personal area network increases the probability of concurrent scheduling of non‐interfering transmissions in a localized area, which results in an immense increase in network throughput. However, the optimum scheduling of concurrent transmission is an NP-hard problem.

== Cellular networks ==
Cellular networks, such as GSM, UMTS or LTE networks, also use a MAC layer. The MAC protocol in cellular networks is designed to maximize the utilization of the expensive licensed spectrum. The air interface of a cellular network is at layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model; at layer 2, it is divided into multiple protocol layers. In UMTS and LTE, those protocols are the Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP), the Radio Link Control (RLC) protocol, and the MAC protocol. The base station has absolute control over the air interface and schedules the downlink access as well as the uplink access of all devices. The MAC protocol is specified by 3GPP in TS 25.321 for UMTS, TS 36.321 for LTE and TS 38.321 for 5G.

*&quot;Unknown dates&quot;
**Discovery of the 1603 First Quarto edition of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (a so-called &quot;bad quarto&quot;), by Sir Henry Bunbury, causes scholarly excitement.
**London actor Edmund Kean reinstates in performance the original, tragic ending of Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;King Lear&quot;, not generally used since 1681, although it is not well received.
**The London publisher C. Baldwyn brings out the first English translation of &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot; as &quot;German Popular Stories. Translated from the &quot;Kinder und Haus Märchen&quot; collected by MM. Grimm from Oral Tradition&quot;. The anonymous translations were made by two lawyers, Edgar Taylor and David Jardine, and the illustrations by George Cruikshank, who is beginning to focus on this medium.

<text>Borth () is a village, seaside resort and community in Ceredigion, Mid Wales; it is located 7 miles (11 km) north of Aberystwyth, on the Ceredigion Coast Path. The community includes the settlement of Ynyslas and the population was 1,399 in 2011. From being largely Welsh-speaking, the village has become anglicised; over 54 per cent of its residents were born in England. According to both the 1991 and 2001 censuses, 43 per cent of the residents of Borth were primarily Welsh-speakers.

==Features and history==
Borth&#x27;s sandy beach has helped to promote it as a seaside resort. There is a youth hostel in the village, and caravan and camping sites nearby.
There is an ancient submerged forest visible at low tide along the beach, where stumps of oak, pine, birch, willow and hazel (preserved by the acid anaerobic conditions in the peat) can be seen. Radiocarbon dating suggests the trees date from about 1500 BCE. This submerged forest also ties in with the legend of Cantre&#x27;r Gwaelod. The stumps were exposed for a time by Storm Hannah in 2019.

Cors Fochno, a raised peat mire, part of the Dyfi Biosphere, is the only UNESCO Biosphere reserve in Wales. It is located next to the village, together with the Dyfi National Nature Reserve and visitors&#x27; centre at Ynyslas. The village is crossed by a long-distance footpath, the Dyfi Valley Way.

On 4 April 1876, the entire Uppingham School in Rutland, England, consisting of 300 boys, 30 masters and their families, moved to Borth for a period of 14 months, taking over the disused Cambrian Hotel and a large number of boarding houses, to avoid a typhoid epidemic.

==Amenities and functions==
Borth is the location of the Borth Animalarium and the Borth and Ynyslas Golf Club, which was used for many of the scenes in TV series &quot;Hinterland&quot;.

The Borth inshore lifeboat (ILB) station was established in 1966 at the southern end of the beach.

The village war memorial, above a cliff south of the beach, was struck by lightning on 21 March 1983 and had to be rebuilt.

In 2008 and 2009, Borth hosted The Square Festival.

In 2011, work commenced on the first phase of a £12-million coastal protection scheme along the Borth to Ynyslas coastline, which was finished in 2015. The work was funded by the Welsh Assembly and the EU. An unexpected consequence of the coastal defence work was to reveal the remains of the petrified forest mentioned earlier.

In 2018, Borth was subjected to a media furore over the escape of a wild lynx from its local zoo.

In 2019, Borth hosted a community street production called &quot;Borth Begins&quot;.

The village football team, Borth United, resumed playing in the Cambrian Tyres 1st Division in the 2021–22 season.

==Transport==
Borth railway station is on the Cambrian Line. It is generally served by hourly trains each way between Aberystwyth to the west and alternating between Birmingham International and Shrewsbury in the east. Services are operated by Transport for Wales.

The station building houses &quot;Borth Station Museum&quot;, which displays community and railway historical artifacts and temporary exhibitions. The museum is run by volunteers.

An electoral ward named Borth stretches south-east to Geneu&#x27;r Glyn. Its total population at the 2011 Census was 2,078. Borth is also the name of a ward in the current Ceredigion County Council, covering the communities of Borth and Llandre.

===Local government history===
Borth had a representative on Cardiganshire County Council from its formation in 1889. The first councillor elected was Rev. Enoch Watkin James, Brynderwen, a Liberal candidate and Calvinistic Methodist minister. After his election in January 1889, according to a local newspaper, &quot;flags were generally displayed and after nightfall bonfires lighted, fireworks discharged, houses illuminated and hundreds of people paraded the streets up to a late hour. About six o&#x27;clock, the rev. gentlemen and friends were drawn in an open carriage through the village and, addressing the assembly, said that the day was rapidly approaching when laws would be made by the people for the people.&quot;

Borth was represented on Ceredigion District Council by Tom Raw-Rees, from the 1970s until his death in 2001. He latterly sat also for Borth on Ceredigion County Council. Before 1996, the Borth ward for elections to Dyfed County Council covered Borth, Ceulanamaesmawr and Tirymynach.

==In popular culture==
* The 1976 award-winning children&#x27;s fantasy novel, &quot;A String in the Harp&quot; by the American author Nancy Bond, is set in Borth and the surrounding countryside.
* Borth, Cors Fochno and the railway station form the backdrop to the main storyline in series 1, episode 4 (&quot;The Girl in the Water&quot;) of &quot;Y Gwyll&quot; (&quot;Hinterland&quot; in English), transmitted on S4C in 2013 and BBC1 Wales in January 2014.

<text>Douglas Robert Gilmour (born June 25, 1963) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He played 20 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for seven different teams. Gilmour was a seventh round selection, 134th overall, of the St. Louis Blues at the 1982 NHL Entry Draft and recorded 1,414 points in 1,474 games in the NHL between 1983 and 2003. A two-time All-Star, he was a member of Calgary&#x27;s 1989 Stanley Cup championship team and won the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s best defensive forward in 1992–93. Internationally, he represented Canada three times during his career and was a member of the nation&#x27;s 1987 Canada Cup championship team.

Gilmour was nicknamed &quot;Killer&quot; by a Blues teammate possibly due to his having the same last name as serial killer Gary Gilmore (though others have attributed it to his physical style of play despite his small stature). He played three seasons of junior hockey for the Cornwall Royals where he was a member of their Memorial Cup championship team in 1981. In 1982–83, Gilmour was named the most outstanding player in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) after he scored 177 points, one of the highest totals in league history. Gilmour returned to the OHL following his playing career as he joined the Kingston Frontenacs as head coach in 2008 and was promoted to general manager in 2011. Gilmour was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame and the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2011 and his uniform number 93 is retired by the Toronto Maple Leafs.

==Early life==
Doug Gilmour was born June 25, 1963, in Kingston, Ontario. He is the younger son of Don and Dolly Gilmour, and has an elder brother, David. Don was a correctional officer who worked at the Kingston Penitentiary for over three decades. He also coached youth baseball and hockey teams in the city. As a youth, Doug looked up to David, who was a professional hockey player drafted by the Vancouver Canucks but never played in the National Hockey League (NHL). The younger Gilmour played in the 1976 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Kingston.

Gilmour&#x27;s small size – he stood five feet, nine inches tall and weighed 140 pounds in junior hockey – resulted in his being cut from several teams throughout his minor hockey career. Originally a defenceman, Gilmour began his 16-year-old season (1979–80) in Junior B with his hometown Kingston Voyageurs. Given only three minutes of ice time per game, he asked the team for his release so that he could return to Major Midget hockey where he would get more ice time. Instead, he was offered a spot with the Junior A Belleville Bulls, with whom he began as a defenceman but shifted to left wing during the playoffs due to injuries.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
The Cornwall Royals of the major junior Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) drafted Gilmour from Belleville, and he joined the team for the 1980–81 season. The Royals were the defending Memorial Cup champions, and Gilmour was not expected to play a significant role with the team. The Royals started him off as an offensive defenceman, but moved him to forward permanently. As national champions, the Royals represented Canada at the 1981 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Gilmour appeared in all five tournament games, though he scored no points, as the team struggled to a seventh-place finish in the eight team tournament. In the QMJHL, Gilmour&#x27;s season was interrupted by a broken collarbone. He finished the year with 35 points in 51 games. The Royals won the QMJHL championship and earned a berth in the 1981 Memorial Cup. Gilmour recorded seven points in five games at the tournament. Cornwall faced the Ontario Hockey League (OHL)&#x27;s Kitchener Rangers in the championship game. Cornwall won 5–2 to repeat as national champions; Gilmour scored the winning goal midway through the second period.

Though eligible for the 1981 NHL Entry Draft, Gilmour went unselected and returned to Cornwall, who had shifted to the OHL for the 1981–82 season. He played a more significant role with the Royals and led the team offensively; Gilmour&#x27;s 119 points in 67 games was sixth best in the league. NHL teams continued to dismiss Gilmour due to his size, but the St. Louis Blues gambled on him in the 1982 NHL Entry Draft by selecting him with their seventh round pick, 134th overall. The Blues returned him to Cornwall for the 1982–83 season where he led the OHL in goals (70), assists (107) and points (177). Gilmour won the Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy as the leading scorer, was named a league all-star, and was named recipient of the Red Tilson Trophy as the OHL&#x27;s most outstanding player. His season total of 177 points is the third highest in OHL history, behind Bobby Smith (192) and Wayne Gretzky (182). Gilmour had a 55-game point streak that lasted from October 19, 1982, until February 27, 1983, and which remains an OHL record.

===St. Louis Blues===
Despite his performance in Cornwall, the Blues did not make signing Gilmour a priority. Unsure if a contract offer would materialize, Gilmour made plans to play in Düsseldorf, West Germany, and had already traveled to Europe when the Blues finally offered him a deal in mid-August 1983. St. Louis coach Jacques Demers believed Gilmour had the potential to be a defensive specialist at forward. He began the 1983–84 season in St. Louis and made his NHL debut on October 4, 1983, against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Gilmour scored his first goal on November 1, in his 12th game, against Eddie Mio of the Detroit Red Wings. He finished the season with 25 goals and 53 points. Teammate Brian Sutter began calling Gilmour &quot;Charlie&quot;, after Charles Manson, in reference to both his &quot;mean&quot; style of play and an apparent resemblance to the serial killer; it morphed into &quot;Killer&quot;, a nickname Gilmour retained throughout his career.

Gilmour&#x27;s offensive performances were consistent in his following two seasons. He recorded 57 points in 1984–85 and 53 points in 1985–86. Defensively, Demers matched Gilmour up at centre against the opposition&#x27;s best players and he played an agitator role. Over time, he gained confidence in his ability to both defend against the opposition and play an offensive role. Gilmour established a role as a top offensive scorer for the Blues in the 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs as he recorded 21 points in 19 games. He tied with teammate Bernie Federko for the league lead in playoff scoring, despite the fact that the Blues failed to reach the Stanley Cup Finals. The Blues were eliminated in the Campbell Conference Final by the Calgary Flames. His offensive breakout continuing into the 1986–87 season, Gilmour led the Blues and finished fifth overall in NHL scoring with 105 points; his 42 goals was the highest single-season total of his career. His performance in the NHL season earned Gilmour an invitation to join Team Canada at the 1987 Canada Cup. He had two goals in the tournament as Canada won the championship.

An 86-point season followed in 1987–88. Gilmour was part of history in a December 19, 1987, game against the Boston Bruins, a 7–5 victory. Two seconds after Ken Linseman scored for Boston, Gilmour replied for St. Louis as the pair combined to set a record for the fastest two goals in league history.

Gilmour became embroiled in a legal conflict. He was sued in August 1988 by the parents of a 14-year-old girl who alleged that Gilmour had sexually assaulted their daughter. His wife Robyne, the Blues organization and the team&#x27;s president Jack Quinn were also named in the $1 million lawsuit as it was alleged that they &quot;knew or should have known&quot; about the alleged abuse. The Blues were also accused of pretending to negotiate a payment while attempting to trade Gilmour without informing the other team of the allegations. One week later, on September 6, the Blues traded Gilmour to the Flames in a multi-player deal. Gilmour, Mark Hunter, Steve Bozek and Michael Dark were sent to Calgary in exchange for Mike Bullard, Craig Coxe, and Tim Corkery. Bozek, however, was traded to the Vancouver Canucks that same day. Gilmour expressed disappointment at leaving the Blues, but stated that &quot;from what has happened the past week, on our part and on the St. Louis Blues&#x27; part, it was our best solution.&quot;

===Calgary Flames===
Gilmour&#x27;s legal situation progressed throughout the early part of the 1988–89 NHL season as he began his career with the Flames: He and his wife countersued his accusers for slander and libel in October, and a grand jury was convened to investigate whether criminal charges were warranted. Gilmour denied the allegations and by the end of the year, the grand jury chose not to indict Gilmour. The lawsuit was dropped shortly after, and Gilmour stated that he was moving on from the ordeal.

On the ice, Gilmour tied with Håkan Loob for second in team scoring with 85 points, behind Joe Mullen&#x27;s 110 as the Flames won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the top regular season team in the NHL. Gilmour played a pivotal role in the Flames&#x27; run to the 1989 Stanley Cup Finals; he was particularly effective in Calgary&#x27;s second round series against the Los Angeles Kings where he scored or assisted on key goals in three of the four games while playing an effective role in preventing the Kings&#x27; star Wayne Gretzky from establishing his own offensive game. Gilmour recorded 11 goals and 11 assists in 22 games during the Flames&#x27; playoff run. In the sixth game of the final, against the Montreal Canadiens, he scored two goals – including the championship winning tally – in a 4–2 victory that clinched the Flames first Stanley Cup.

Early in the 1989–90 season, Gilmour was again part of goal-scoring history. He scored a shorthanded goal with 15 seconds remaining in regulation time, followed four seconds later by teammate Paul Ranheim. The two goals salvaged an 8–8 tie in the October 17, 1989, contest against the Quebec Nordiques. It tied an NHL record for fastest two goals by one team (since broken), and remains the record for fastest two shorthanded goals. He completed the season as the team&#x27;s leader in assists with 67, and second in points at 91. The Flames named Gilmour one of the team&#x27;s captains for the 1990–91 season, a year in which he surpassed 600 games and 600 points for his career. He also became embroiled in a physical melee with Los Angeles Kings assistant coach Tom Webster late in the season. An argument between the two teams escalated into a physical altercation; Gilmour was suspended two games for shoving Webster, while the coach received four for punching Gilmour.

An off-season salary dispute with Flames&#x27; general manager Doug Risebrough carried into the 1991–92 season. Gilmour, who was playing the option year of his contract at a salary of US$450,000 was unable to reach a deal with the team on an extension. The dispute went to arbitration where the Flames offered a raise to $550,000 while he asked for $1.2 million and was expecting a settlement worth around $800,000. The arbitrator&#x27;s decision, made in December 1991, amounted to $750,000 per season for two years, but left Gilmour angry and bitter. He alleged that executives with the team and league had tampered with the process – the arbitrator attended a Flames game with team management on the night before the hearing, while NHL President John Ziegler sent a letter to the arbitrators. Gilmour, who remained active with the Flames throughout the process, had scored 38 points in 38 games. Following the decision, he requested a trade out of Calgary and threatened legal action. Gilmour led the Flames to a 3–2 overtime victory over the Montreal Canadiens with a goal and an assist on New Year&#x27;s Eve then walked out on the club on January 1, 1992. He later called the choice to walk away from the team to be one of the toughest decisions he had ever made.

The following day, Calgary dealt Gilmour to the Toronto Maple Leafs as part of a ten player swap, the largest trade in NHL history. Calgary sent Gilmour, Jamie Macoun, Ric Nattress, Kent Manderville and Rick Wamsley to Toronto in exchange for Gary Leeman, Craig Berube, Michel Petit, Alexander Godynyuk and Jeff Reese. The deal altered the trajectory of both franchises as Gilmour immediately revitalized the Maple Leafs while the Flames franchise entered a long decline after the deal that was immediately judged to have ended in Toronto&#x27;s favour.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
Within a month of the trade, Gilmour and the Maple Leafs agreed to a new contract that was reported to be worth $4 million over four years. With only 30 wins in 80 games, Toronto was one of the worst teams in the NHL in 1991–92, however recorded 20 of those victories in the second half of the season following the trade. Gilmour scored 49 points for Toronto, and finished the year with 87 points combined between the Flames and Maple Leafs. Upon joining the Maple Leafs, Gilmour switched his number from #39 to #93 which he would wear for the rest of his career.

In his first full season with the Maple Leafs, 1992–93, Gilmour had the finest season of his career. He broke Toronto franchise records for assists (95) and points (127), and on February 13, 1993, tied Babe Pratt&#x27;s franchise record by assisting on six goals in one game. Gilmour finished seventh overall in NHL scoring, but was also subject to a controversial suspension during the year. The league suspended Gilmour for eight practice days – but no games – after he broke Tomas Sandström&#x27;s forearm with a slash. The Maple Leafs finished the season with the eighth-best record in the NHL, and posted their first winning season since 1978–79.

In the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Gilmour broke the team scoring record by scoring 35 points as Toronto reached the Campbell Conference Final. The sixth game of the series, against the Los Angeles Kings, ended in controversy. Toronto led the series three games to two and one additional victory would have put the Maple Leafs into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1967. In the first minute of overtime with the score tied 4–4, Gilmour was cut on his chin for eight stitches after he was struck by Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s stick. League rules of the time mandated that player who caused an injury via a high-sticking infraction be assessed a five-minute penalty, however referee Kerry Fraser made no call on the play, even after conferring with his linesmen. Instead, Gretzky remained on the ice and scored the game-winning goal seconds later. Gretzky then led Los Angeles to a game seven victory that eliminated Toronto from the playoffs. Toronto fans remain bitter about the non-call two decades after the fact, while Fraser – who explained he did not have a clear view of the play – admitted it was the worst mistake he made in over 2,100 games as an NHL referee.

Individually, Gilmour earned several accolades for his season: He played in the 1993 All-Star Game (his first of two consecutive appearances), was named recipient of the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top defensive forward, and finished second to Mario Lemieux in voting for the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s most valuable player. The Maple Leafs agreed to renegotiate Gilmour&#x27;s contract following the season; the two sides agreed to a five-year, $15 million contract early in the 1993–94 season that included endorsement rights and was expected to allow Gilmour to complete his career in Toronto.

Gilmour recorded his third career 100-point season in 1993–94 as he finished fourth in NHL scoring with 111 points. During the season, Gilmour briefly required police protection after receiving death threats from an unidentified woman. He finished fourth in post-season scoring with 28 points as the Maple Leafs again reached the Western Conference Final before losing to the Vancouver Canucks. Gilmour finished fourth in Hart Trophy voting and second in Selke trophy voting.

The Maple Leafs named Gilmour the 15th captain in franchise history on August 18, 1994, as he succeeded Wendel Clark, who was traded to the Quebec Nordiques in the off-season. The 1994–95 season was delayed by a labour dispute. The stoppage prompted several players to sign temporarily with European teams. Gilmour signed in Switzerland and joined the Rapperswil-Jona Lakers in November 1994. He appeared in nine games with the National League A team and scored two goals to go along with 13 assists before returning to Canada. He also attempted to join Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s exhibition tour of Europe when able. Gilmour returned to the Maple Leafs when the NHL&#x27;s dispute was resolved; in 44 games with Toronto, he had 10 goals and 23 assists.

Gilmour reached a career milestone during the 1995–96 season as he scored his 1,000th career point on December 23, 1995, in a 6–1 victory over Edmonton.

Gilmour was one of the most popular players on the Leafs during his tenure. He was a spokesman for the NHLPA in community and charity events, and also appeared in a series of &quot;Got Milk?&quot; TV commercials, one which featured his then wife Amy.

===Later career===
With the Leafs struggling once again, Cliff Fletcher traded Gilmour and defenseman Dave Ellett to the New Jersey Devils in 1997 for centreman Steve Sullivan, prospect Alyn McCauley and defenseman Jason Smith. The Devils during Gilmour&#x27;s tenure would then suffer early playoff exits.

In the summer of 1998, Doug Gilmour signed as a free agent with the Chicago Blackhawks. Chicago had fallen on hard times and Gilmour was brought in to help resurrect the franchise. Chicago was situated at the bottom half of the standings during Gilmour&#x27;s tenure, ultimately culminating with captain Chris Chelios requesting a trade to the Detroit Red Wings, and Gilmour assuming the team captaincy the following season.

Gilmour&#x27;s Blackhawks played against the Toronto Maple Leafs on February 13, 1999, as the last game in historic Maple Leaf Gardens was played. Gilmour scored in the game and was given a standing ovation by the Toronto fans during the Gardens&#x27; closing ceremonies. Gilmour suffered a back injury (herniated disk) late in the season and had to undergo season-ending surgery.

In the spring of 2000, with the Blackhawks once again floundering among the bottom of the NHL, Gilmour was traded to the Buffalo Sabres along with left winger J.P. Dumont for forward Michal Grošek. Gilmour helped the Sabres, which had been Stanley Cup finalists the season before, make the playoffs. However the Sabres were defeated in five games by the Philadelphia Flyers.

In 2000–01, injuries limited Gilmour&#x27;s regular season stats but had respectable playoff performance as the Sabres defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the Quarterfinal Round of the NHL playoffs. The Sabres were subsequently upset 4 games to 3 by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round.

After what &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; called an &#x27;unhappy season&#x27; with the Sabres, Gilmour contemplated retirement, but as the start of the season approached, was rumored to be signing with the Ottawa Senators. Ultimately, one day after the contract leaked online, on October 6, 2001, Gilmor signed a one-year, $1.8 million (not including incentives) contract with the Montreal Canadiens, with a club option for a second year at $2 million. Montreal was looking to bolster centre-depth, being considered weak at the position following the cancer diagnosis of Saku Koivu. The Canadiens would make the playoffs that season, eventually being beaten by the Carolina Hurricanes.

Following his first year with Montreal, which saw the centre record 41 points, Gilmour resigned with the Canadiens to a one-year contract with an option for the 2003–04 season on August 9, 2002. The Canadiens would trade Gilmour to the playoff bound Maple Leafs for a sixth-round draft pick at the 2003 NHL trade deadline. Gilmour&#x27;s first game with the Leafs turned out to be his last as he and the Calgary Flames Dave Lowry collided inadvertently during Gilmour&#x27;s second shift, with Gilmour tearing his ACL and missing the remainder of the season. At 40 years old, Gilmour officially announced his retirement on September 8, 2003, still facing possibly months of rehabilitation for his spring ACL tear and after new Maple Leafs general manager John Ferguson Jr. made a public announcement that the Maple Leafs would not re-sign the veteran centre.

Gilmour scored 450 goals and 964 assists in 1474 games in his NHL career.

On January 31, 2009, Gilmour&#x27;s number 93 was honoured by the Toronto Maple Leafs as it was raised to the rafters at Air Canada Centre. Gilmour became the seventeenth player to be honoured in such a way by the Maple Leafs. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2011. On October 15, 2016, Gilmour&#x27;s number 93 was retired by the Maple Leafs, along with all other honoured numbers also being retired.

==Coaching career==

===Toronto Maple Leafs/Toronto Marlies (AHL)===
On September 15, 2006, the Toronto Maple Leafs announced that Gilmour would become their player development advisor. Gilmour held that position with the Leafs until August 7, 2008, when the Maple Leafs announced that Gilmour would join the Toronto Marlies, the Leafs American Hockey League affiliate, as an assistant coach under Marlies head coach Greg Gilbert. Gilmour held that position for only a few months before leaving the Maple Leafs&#x27; organization to become the head coach of the Kingston Frontenacs of the OHL in November 2008.

===Kingston Frontenacs===
Gilmour was named head coach of the Kingston Frontenacs on November 17, 2008, taking over a rebuilding club that had a 5–13–5 record under Larry Mavety, who had coached Gilmour with the Belleville Bulls when the Bulls were still in the OPJHL. Gilmour finished out the season with Kingston with a 13–27–5 record in their last 45 games and the team failed to make the playoffs.

In his first full season with the club in 2009–10, Gilmour helped guide the team back into the OHL playoffs, as Kingston recorded a 33–30–5 record, earning 71 points, good enough for second place in the OHL&#x27;s East Division, and fourth place in the OHL&#x27;s Eastern Conference. The Frontenacs faced the Brampton Battalion in the first round of the playoffs, which Brampton won in seven games. After the season, Gilmour signed to a five-year contract extension with the Frontenacs.

In 2010–11, the Frontenacs slipped under the .500 level during the regular season, going 29–30–9, earning 67 points, but still made the playoffs. In their first round match up against the Oshawa Generals, Kingston struggled and the Generals eliminated them in five games. At the conclusion of the season, Gilmour left the Frontenacs&#x27; head coaching position to become the team&#x27;s general manager, replacing good friend Larry Mavety, who became an advisor to the club. Former Maple Leafs teammate Todd Gill was selected to replace Gilmour behind the Frontenacs bench.

As general manager of the Frontenacs, Gilmour began to rebuild the club, as the club struggled to a 19–41–8 record during the 2011–12 season, finishing in last place in the Eastern Conference, well out of a playoff spot. Kingston saw some improvement during the 2012–13 season, as the team finished with a 27–35–6 record, earning 60 points, good for seventh place in the conference, and a playoff spot. The Frontenacs were swept in the first round against the Barrie Colts. The Frontenacs improved once again in the 2013–14 season, earning a record of 39–23–6, getting 84 points, and third place in the Eastern Conference. Kingston met the Peterborough Petes in the first round of the playoffs, and the team took a 3–0 lead in the best-of-seven series. The Petes made a comeback, winning the final four games of the series, to eliminate the Frontenacs.

He stepped down as general manager and became the president of the Frontenacs in 2017. In 2019, he left the team to become a community representative for the Maple Leafs.

==Personal life==
Gilmour has been married three times and has four children. His daughter Maddison (now married to hockey player Evan McGrath) is from his first marriage to Robyne Gilmour; sons Jake and Tyson from his second marriage to Amy Gilmour; and daughter Victoria with his current wife, Sonya Gilmour.

<doc id="207485" wikidata="Q287078" url="?curid=207485" title="ABC (band)">
<text>ABC is an English pop band that originated in Sheffield in 1980, evolving from the earlier ensemble Vice Versa. The band&#x27;s classic formation featured Martin Fry as the lead vocalist, Mark White on guitar and keyboards, Stephen Singleton playing the saxophone, and David Palmer behind the drums.

ABC achieved ten UK and five US top 40 hit singles between 1981 and 1990, and their 1982 debut studio album, &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot;, was a UK number one. Their early-1980s success in the US saw them associated with the Second British Invasion. ABC continue to tour and released a ninth studio album, &quot;The Lexicon of Love II&quot;, in 2016.

==History==
===Formation===
ABC has its roots in Vice Versa, a Sheffield band formed in 1977 by synthesizer players Stephen Singleton and Mark White. Their debut gig was as the support to Wire at the Outlook club in Sheffield. They founded their own label, Neutron Records, releasing the EP &quot;Music 4&quot;. Martin Fry, who wrote the fanzine &quot;Modern Drugs&quot;, interviewed Vice Versa and shortly afterwards they asked him to join as synthesizer player. Fry accepted and by late 1980 the band had evolved into ABC, with Fry becoming lead singer. The band&#x27;s last day as Vice Versa was at the Futurama 2 Festival in Leeds in September 1980; from then on it performed as ABC, with Singleton playing saxophone and White on guitar and keyboards. In the new year, Singleton and White were joined by Mark Lickley on bass and David Robinson on drums.

=== &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot;, &quot;Beauty Stab&quot; &amp; &quot;How to Be a Zillionaire&quot;: 1981–1985 ===
The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot;, made the UK top 20 in 1981. Soon afterwards, Robinson left the band and was replaced by David Palmer; Lickley departed shortly thereafter and was not replaced. In 1982, the band released their debut studio album &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot;, which reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. Produced by Trevor Horn, it often featured in UK critics&#x27; lists of favourite albums: it ranked 42nd in &quot;The Observer Music Monthly&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 British Albums&quot; (June 2004) and 40th in &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest British Albums&quot; (June 2000). The band had three top 10 hits during 1982: the singles &quot;Poison Arrow&quot;, &quot;The Look of Love&quot; (both of which were recorded whilst Mark Lickley was still a member of the band), and &quot;All of My Heart&quot;. Several high-concept music videos were made, including the long-form spy pastiche &quot;Mantrap&quot; by Julien Temple.

Following the culmination of the &quot;Lexicon of Love&quot; tour, Palmer joined the Yellow Magic Orchestra for a series of tour dates; shortly thereafter Fry, White and Singleton decided to reconvene in order to commence work on their next album, leading Palmer to depart ABC in order to honour his commitments to Yellow Magic Orchestra&#x27;s tour. The remaining members found it difficult to follow up on the success of their debut. Their second album, &quot;Beauty Stab&quot;, was released in November 1983, produced by Gary Langan who was the engineer on &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot;. It performed poorly in comparison to its predecessor, peaking at No. 12. The first single from the album, &quot;That Was Then but This Is Now&quot;, briefly appeared in the UK top 20, followed by a top 40 showing for &quot;SOS&quot;. The band eschewed remixes for the project and so the 12&quot; single for &quot;That Was Then but This Is Now&quot; featured the disclaimer &quot;This record is exactly the same as the 7&quot; version. The choice is yours.&quot;

Singleton left the band shortly after the release of &quot;Beauty Stab&quot; as a result of Fry and White&#x27;s reluctance to spend much time touring the band&#x27;s material. Fry and White then enlisted the services of Fiona Russell Powell (under the name &quot;Eden&quot;) and David Yarritu in the band&#x27;s new line-up. Russell Powell had been a member of the original line-up of the pre-ABC band, Vice Versa. According to an article published on 7 March 1997, she &#x27;chickened out&#x27; of Vice Versa&#x27;s first live gig, and the job as frontman went to Fry. The Fry-White-Russell Powell-Yarritu line-up recorded the album &quot;How to Be a ... Zillionaire!&quot;, released in 1985. The band&#x27;s chart success dwindled further in the UK with this album, but they did score their first US top 10 hit with &quot;Be Near Me&quot;, which also made the UK top 30. The album also featured the singles &quot;(How to Be a) Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Vanity Kills&quot; and &quot;Ocean Blue&quot;. Inspiration for the album&#x27;s cartoons of the band members was taken from a photo shoot by David Levine whose work featured on many of the sleeves for singles released from this album. Keith LeBlanc from Tackhead programmed much of the beatbox work for the album.

=== Chart success continues with &quot;Alphabet City&quot;: 1986–1988 ===
After a hiatus, during which Fry was being treated for Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, he and White reconvened ABC as a duo, releasing the album &quot;Alphabet City&quot; in 1987. The album returned them to the UK Top 10 for the first time in five years, peaking at No. 7. It featured &quot;When Smokey Sings&quot;, a tribute to Smokey Robinson, which narrowly missed the UK Top 10. The song did give the group their biggest hit in the US, where it peaked at number 5 in September. The album also spawned &quot;The Night You Murdered Love&quot; (UK No. 31) and &quot;King Without a Crown&quot; (UK No. 44) as singles.

=== &quot;Up&quot;, greatest hits album &quot;Absolutely&quot; &amp; &quot;Abracadabra&quot;: 1989–1992 ===
In 1989, the duo issued &quot;Up&quot;, their fifth and final PolyGram studio album. This time experimenting with house music, ABC scored a minor UK hit with the single &quot;One Better World&quot;. A second single, &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, and the album itself were less successful. During this period, the duo worked on a couple of outside productions aimed at the house music scene. One was Paul Rutherford&#x27;s (Frankie Goes to Hollywood) solo album and first single release; the other was for Lizzie Tear on the duo&#x27;s own Neutron label.

In 1990, the band released a greatest hits compilation album, &quot;Absolutely&quot;. This covered all of ABC&#x27;s albums up until 1990 and featured most of their singles. The compilation made the UK Top 10. A video package featuring promos was also released. One new song, &quot;The Look of Love &#x27;90&quot;, was released to promote the package.

The duo moved to the EMI label (and MCA in North America), where they recorded the 1991 album &quot;Abracadabra&quot;. Two singles, &quot;Love Conquers All&quot; and &quot;Say It&quot;, narrowly missed the UK Top 40, though a remix of the latter by the Italian production team Black Box appeared on the US dance chart.

Martin Fry also collaborated with M People in 1991 on their first album, &quot;Northern Soul&quot;, recording vocals for the song &quot;Life&quot;. However, when the album was re-released in 1992, and again in 1995, this track was omitted.

===&quot;Skyscraping&quot; and comeback: 1997–2007===
After a six-year hiatus, ABC released the album &quot;Skyscraping&quot;, an homage to several of his musical heroes, including David Bowie, Roxy Music and the Sex Pistols. With Glenn Gregory of Heaven 17 and Keith Lowndes contributing to the sessions and songwriting, the album was commercially unsuccessful though a single, &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, reached No. 57 in the UK. Two other singles, &quot;Rolling Sevens&quot; and &quot;Skyscraping&quot;, did not chart.

In 1999, ABC released their first live album, &quot;The Lexicon of Live&quot;. The album covered most of their major hits. Although Fry was the only member left, he had a backing band and adorned the album cover in his famed gold lamé suit.

&quot;Look of Love – The Very Best of ABC&quot; was released in 2001. Although essentially a reissue of the 1990 greatest hits compilation &quot;Absolutely&quot;, the album featured two new songs by Fry, &quot;Peace and Tranquility&quot; and &quot;Blame&quot;. A companion DVD, along with a bonus disc of remixes, was also released.

In 2004, the VH1 show &quot;Bands Reunited&quot; attempted to get the band&#x27;s classic line-up of Fry, White, Singleton and Palmer together for a reunion concert. Fry and Palmer appeared and played together (with help from Nick Beggs of Kajagoogoo) for the first time in over twenty years. Singleton and White opted not to participate.

===&quot;Traffic&quot;: 2007–2015===
Following a tour of the United States in May and June 2006, Fry and Palmer, together with session keyboardist Chuck Kentis, put together a new ABC album, &quot;Traffic&quot;. It was released on 28 April 2008. Gary Langan, who worked on &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot; and &quot;Beauty Stab&quot;, mixed and produced the album. The first single, &quot;The Very First Time&quot;, debuted on BBC Radio 2 in January, was added to the station&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; playlist for the week beginning 29 March and was released as a music download track on 1 April.

On 1 September 2007, ABC performed a set with other 1980s acts at Retrofest at Culzean Castle in Ayrshire, Scotland. This appearance included a rendition of &quot;Addicted to Love&quot;, with Tony Hadley of Spandau Ballet and Peter Cox of Go West.

In the summer of 2008, ABC toured the US as part of the 2008 Regeneration Tour, which also featured the Human League, Belinda Carlisle, A Flock of Seagulls and Naked Eyes.

In April 2009, ABC performed &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot; album live at the Royal Albert Hall, accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra. Anne Dudley of Art of Noise, who arranged and played keyboards on the original record, conducted the performance. A music review in the 13 April 2009 edition of &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper, described the performance as a &quot;glorious night that has placed one of the Eighties&#x27; most perfectly constructed albums back near the top of the pop pantheon&quot;.

In 2009 ABC toured the US as the headliner of the 2009 Regeneration Tour, which also featured Terri Nunn of Berlin, Wang Chung and Cutting Crew.

In June, July and August 2011, ABC performed at a few locations around the UK as well as Las Vegas, Nevada. In October 2011, ABC performing dates in Melbourne, Australia.

On 19 July 2012, Fry was made an honorary Doctor of Music at the University of Sheffield for his contribution to music over more than thirty years. The following day his daughter Nancy received her degree from the Department of Sociological Studies from the same university.

On 1 March 2013, ABC appeared in Dubai, UAE, in the &#x27;80s Rewind&#x27; concert with Rick Astley, Heaven 17, Howard Jones and T&#x27;Pau.

In June 2014, it was revealed that a dozen early tapes had been discovered of rare remixes and unheard songs from ABC&#x27;s first three albums. These were returned to Martin Fry who was delighted, but unsure as to what he would do with them. According to &quot;Classic Pop&quot;, the rediscovered songs include &quot;a &#x27;That&#x27;s It Folks!&#x27; mix of &#x27;So Hip It Hurts&#x27; from &quot;Zillionaire&quot;. From &quot;Beauty Stab&quot;, reams of early studio takes have come to light including one song, &#x27;You and Me&#x27;, that never made the final album. From &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot; era, the band&#x27;s own, pre-Trevor Horn demos of &#x27;All of My Heart&#x27; have come to light, along with a reel entitled &#x27;4 Ever 2 Gether – The Outtake, Starring Martin Fry as Ken Dodd&#x27;&quot;.

===&quot;The Lexicon of Love II&quot;: 2016 - 2021===

In October 2015, Fry announced that he was working on a new ABC album. &quot;It&#x27;s going to be a take on &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot;, but all these years on. I&#x27;m a man in my fifties now with a wealth of experience. It&#x27;s about how you grow older but you make the same mistakes over and over and over again.&quot;

In November 2015, a compilation album entitled &quot;80s Recovered&quot; was released, featuring many artists from the 1980s. ABC contributed a cover of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;High and Dry&quot;, with a regular version and a remix.

In January 2016, Fry said the new ABC album would be entitled &quot;The Lexicon of a Lost Ideal&quot; and released in the UK in May 2016. Featuring tracks penned by Fry, with contributions by Rob Fusari, Marcus Vere, Matt Rowe and Anne Dudley, the album features orchestration arranged by Anne Dudley, who worked in a similar capacity on &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot;. In April 2016, the release of the new album, now entitled &quot;The Lexicon of Love II&quot;, was announced with lead single &quot;Viva Love&quot; made available via digital platforms. It was A playlisted by BBC Radio 2. The release of &quot;Viva Love&quot; was accompanied by a video directed by Julien Temple, who also worked with the band on the Mantrap and Poison Arrow videos, which the new video references.

The album was released in the UK and the US on 27 May 2016 and entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 5, the first time ABC had reached the Top 5 since the original &quot;Lexicon of Love&quot; album in 1982. &quot;The Flames Of Desire&quot; and &quot;Ten Below Zero&quot; were released as follow-up singles. Both were added to the BBC Radio 2 playlist. 

ABC also contributed a new song called &quot;Living Inside My Heart&quot; to &quot;Fly: Songs Inspired by the Film Eddie the Eagle&quot;, the soundtrack of which was released on 18 March 2016 on CD and digitally.

ABC released their first Christmas song, entitled &quot;A Christmas We Deserve&quot;, on 2 December 2016 as part of a four-track EP. The other three songs are acoustic versions of &quot;The Love Inside the Love, &quot;Viva Love&quot; and &quot;The Look of Love&quot;.

In March 2017, just before the band&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall orchestra show on April 6 (featuring songs from &quot;The Lexicon of Love II&quot;, greatest hits and the complete &quot;Lexicon of Love&quot; album) the band announced the November 2017 XYZ tour. During the tour two new songs were performed: &quot;Look Good Tonite&quot; and &quot;The Life And Times Of A Troubadour&quot;. 

On 22 October 2020, the compilation album &quot;The Essential ABC&quot; - featuring songs and remixes from the first five albums - entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 62.

===&quot;The Lexicon of Love 40th Anniversary&quot;: 2022 and beyond ===
On 9 June 2022 ABC released the vinyl-only single &quot;Look Good Tonite&quot;/&quot;Sixty Seconds Later&quot; in the UK.

To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the release of &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot;, the band performed at Sheffield City Hall on 21 June 2022. The show was recorded for future release on CD and DVD.

In January 2023, a US show was announced: the band played at the Cruel World Festival in Pasadena, California on May 20, 2023.

In March 2023, ABC announced the May 19 release of the live double CD &quot;The Lexicon of Love 40th Anniversary Live At Sheffield City Hall&quot;. It was released digitally and as a limited edition live album on 19 May 2023.

The album was recorded in 2022 at a show in ABC’s hometown of Sheffield, to mark the 40th anniversary of the seminal album, &quot;The Lexicon Of Love&quot;. ABC were joined by the original orchestral team of Southbank Sinfonia and longtime collaborator and arranger Anne Dudley who conducted on the evening of the recording. The album features the whole of the original Lexicon Of Love album, plus hits like &quot;When Smokey Sings&quot;, &quot;Be Near Me&quot;, &quot;Viva Love&quot;, &quot;(How To Be A) Millionaire&quot; and &quot;The Flames Of Desire&quot;.

On 4 August, &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot; was reissued (belatedly) for its 40th anniversary with special vinyl editions and an SDE-exclusive blu-ray audio, No. 12 in the ongoing SDE Surround Series. Renowned musician, songwriter and producer Steven Wilson remixed the classic album in Dolby Atmos, 5.1 and stereo for this special reissue, which was also made available on streaming platforms. The album (re)entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 48.

<text>Thomas Addison (April 179529 June 1860) was an English physician and medical researcher. He is traditionally regarded as one of the &quot;great men&quot; of Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London.

Thomas Addison began his career at Guy&#x27;s Hospital in 1817, eventually becoming a full physician in 1837. He was a noted and respected lecturer and diagnostician. He experienced episodes of mental depression throughout his life, culminating in his suicide in 1860.

Addison&#x27;s legacy includes the description of conditions such as Addison&#x27;s disease (a degenerative disease of the adrenal glands), and pernicious anemia, a hematological disorder later found to be caused by failure to absorb vitamin B12.

==Early years==
He was born in April 1795 in Long Benton, nearby to the northeast of Newcastle upon Tyne, the son of Joseph Addison, who was a grocer and flour dealer there. His father&#x27;s family was Cumbrian, and Thomas was attached to the family house at Banks near Lanercost, as his personal background. Joseph Addison had married Sarah Shaw, and gone into the Shaw family business. 

Thomas Addison attended the Long Benton parish school, run by the parish clerk, Thomas Rutter. He then went to the Royal Free Grammar School in Newcastle, where the headmaster was Edward Moises, nephew of the noted Hugh Moises. There he gained a good knowledge of Latin.

==Medical student==
Addison entered the University of Edinburgh Medical School in 1812 as a medical student, turning down an offer from his father to make him a paying resident student of John Thomson. He became a member of the Royal Medical Society. In 1815, he received the degree of MD. His thesis was on &quot;Dissertatio medica inauguralis quaedam de syphilide et hydrargyro complectens&quot; (&quot;Concerning Syphilis and Mercury&quot;).

There is a hiatus in the record of Addison&#x27;s studies from 1815 to 1817. It has been suggested that he travelled in continental Europe. He enrolled as a physician pupil at Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London, in 1817. Guy&#x27;s Medical School recorded his entrance as follows: &quot;Dec. 13, 1817, from Edinburgh, T. Addison, M.D., paid pounds 22-1s to be a perpetual Physician&#x27;s pupil.&quot; Subsequently he became a house surgeon (surgical resident) at the Lock Hospital. He also took a position as physician to the Universal Dispensary founded by John Bunnell Davis.

==Physician==
Addison obtained his licentiate from the Royal College of Physicians in 1819, where in 1838 he was elected a Fellow. He was promoted to assistant physician, with the support of Benjamin Harrison, in January 1824 and in 1827 he was appointed lecturer of materia medica. In 1849, he was President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society.

As well, Addison worked under Thomas Bateman, a dermatologist, at the General or Public Dispensary on Carey Street, Holborn. He was there for eight years and developed a special interest in skin diseases, and a reputation in the area. He bought a house in Hatton Garden in 1819, and from that time had a private practice. 

In 1837, Addison became joint lecturer with Richard Bright on practical medicine, and a full physician at Guy&#x27;s Hospital. When Bright retired from the lectureship in 1840, Addison became sole lecturer. He held this position until about 1854–55.

Excelling as a diagnostician and lecturer, Addison was diffident. He had a reputation at Guy&#x27;s, where he concentrated on his students and patients, but was little known outside the hospital, and had few private patients.

==Depression, death and memorial==
Thomas Addison suffered from episodes of clinical depression at the end of his life. In 1860 he wrote to his medical students as follows: &quot;A considerable breakdown in my health has scared me from the anxieties, responsibilities, and excitement of my profession.&quot; Three months later, on 29 June 1860, he committed suicide. The day after his death, the &quot;Brighton Herald&quot; recorded that: 

&quot;Dr Addison, formerly a physician to Guy&#x27;s Hospital, committed suicide by jumping down the area (i.e. the space between the front of the house and the street) of 15 Wellington Villas, where he had for some time been residing, under the care of two attendants, having before attempted self-destruction.&quot;

Addison was buried in the churchyard of Lanercost Priory in Cumberland. Guy&#x27;s Hospital had a bust made of him, named a hall of the new part of the hospital for him, and perpetuated his memory with a marble wall table in the chapel.

==Research==
In researching pernicious anemia, Addison in 1849 came across the changed &quot;bronzed&quot; appearance of the adrenal glands. What is now called Addison&#x27;s disease, sometimes called bronze skin disease, is the progressive destruction of the glands, resulting in adrenocortical hormone deficiency. Addison described this condition in his 1855 publication: &quot;On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsules.&quot; The function of the glands, known as suprarenal capsules, was at that time unknown. After Addison&#x27;s work, it was concluded that they were essential to life. An Addisonian crisis (or Addison&#x27;s crisis) is an acute, life-threatening crisis caused by Addison&#x27;s disease.

Pernicious anemia as described in 1849 by Addison is now also known as Addison-Biermer disease. It is a type of megaloblastic anemia, in which a lack of intrinsic factor causes absorption of vitamin B12 to be impaired. It is caused by a lack of parietal cells in the stomach.

In 1829, Addison published a study of the actions of poisons. He gave one of the first adequate accounts of appendicitis, in 1839. In the classification of skin diseases by morphology, and their diagnosis, he was a follower of Robert Willan and his own teacher Thomas Bateman.

<text>USS &quot;Amsterdam&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

The ship was laid down on 3 March 1943 at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company, launched on 25 April 1944, sponsored by Mrs. William E. Hasenfuss (the first &quot;Gold Star Mother&quot; of Amsterdam, New York, who had lost her son William E. Hasenfuss, Jr. in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor), and commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard Portsmouth, Virginia, on 8 January 1945, Captain Andrew P. Lawton in command.

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Amsterdam&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-eight Bofors guns in four quadruple and six double mounts and ten Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Amsterdam&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
&quot;Amsterdam&quot; was built at the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia. She was laid down on 3 March 1943 and was launched on 25 March 1944. After completing fitting-out work, the ship was commissioned on 8 January 1945 with the hull number CL-101. The ship began her shakedown cruise in Chesapeake Bay on 5 February. Twelve days later, she departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, bound for Trinidad in the British West Indies. There, she conducted further training that lasted until 13 March, when she sailed back north to the US. While en route, she conducted shore bombardment practice off the island of Culebra. The ship arrived in Norfolk, Virginia on 20 March, steamed briefly to Cape May, New Jersey, for additional shooting practice, and then entered the dry dock at the Norfolk Navy Yard for maintenance. After completing that work on 20 April, the ship embarked on another round of training, initially in the Chesapeake and then in the Caribbean Sea off Culebra and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. From there, she got underway to join the US fleet in the Pacific, passing through the Panama Canal on 5 May and arriving in Pearl Harbor on the 18th. She participated in further combat training there.

The ship left Pearl Harbor on 9 June to join the fleet at Leyte in the Philippine Islands. She reached San Pedro Bay on 21 June and joined 3rd Fleet. Rather than join the main elements of Task Force 38 for a major attack on Japan, &quot;Amsterdam&quot; was assigned to a detachment centered on the aircraft carrier . She formed part of the escort for the carrier, along with the cruisers , , and , and seven destroyers. The unit was sent to carry out a raid on Japanese positions on Wake Island on 18 July. By early August, &quot;Amsterdam&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; had been transferred to Task Group 38.1. Over the next week, she covered the carriers of Task Force 38 during a series of raids on the Japanese home islands. On 15 August, the fleet received word of Japan&#x27;s decision to surrender. By late August, &quot;Amsterdam&quot; had been transferred to TG 38.2. The ship entered Sagami Bay on 27 August with the rest of TF 38 to begin preparations for the formal surrender of Japan, which took place aboard the battleship on 2 September. The ship earned one battle star during her short wartime career.

On 5 September, &quot;Amsterdam&quot; moved to Tokyo Bay during the initial occupation of Japan; she remained there until 20 September, when she departed to return home. She stopped at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, to take on American personnel who were being sent back to the United States. After passing through Pearl Harbor, she arrived in Portland, Oregon, on 15 October, where she took part in the celebration of Navy Day two weeks later. She left Portland on 29 October for San Pedro, California, arriving on 1 November. While there, the ship underwent maintenance and the crew was given shore leave. &quot;Amsterdam&quot; got underway again on 19 November to return to Pearl Harbor six days later. She embarked another contingent of men and equipment to transport back to California, departing on 12 December and arriving in San Pedro on the 18th. She remained there into 1946 before departing on 21 January to move to San Francisco, where her crew prepared her to be relegated to the reserve fleet. After this work was completed, the ship was decommissioned on 30 June 1947. She remained in the Navy&#x27;s inventory until 2 January 1971, when she was stricken from the naval register. She was ultimately sold to the ship breaking firm National Metal and Steel Corporation, Terminal Island, California, on 11 February 1972 and dismantled.

<text>The Professional Performing Arts School, colloquially known as PPAS, is a public middle and high school specializing in the performing arts, located in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.

PPAS maintains professional partnerships with several nearby organizations, including the Juilliard School, School of American Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.

Since 2010, the Waterwell Drama Program (WDP), which was co-founded in 2002 by actor Arian Moayed, has spearheaded PPAS&#x27; drama department.

==History==

The word &quot;toddy&quot; traces back to the Proto-Dravidian root &quot;&quot;tāẓ-&quot; (DED number: 3180),&quot; which means palmyra/toddy palm and gave rise to forms like &quot;tāḍi&quot; or &quot;tāṭi&quot; in Telugu, Gondi, and Kolami-Gadba; &quot;tāri&quot; or &quot;tāḷi&quot; in Kannada and Tulu. The Sanskrit word &quot;tāḍi,&quot; which refers to an extract from palm trees, is a loanword from Dravidian. 

Palm wine production by smallholders and individual farmers may promote conservation as palm trees become a source of regular household income that may economically be worth more than the value of timber sold.

==Tapping==
The sap is extracted and collected by a tapper. Typically the sap is collected from the cut flower of the palm tree. A container is fastened to the flower stump to collect the sap. The white liquid that initially collects tends to be very sweet and non-alcoholic before it is fermented. An alternative method is the felling of the entire tree. Where this is practised, a fire is sometimes lit at the cut end to facilitate the collection of sap.

Palm sap begins fermenting immediately after collection, due to natural yeasts in the air (often spurred by residual yeast left in the collecting container). Within two hours, fermentation yields an aromatic wine of up to 4% alcohol content, mildly intoxicating and sweet. The wine may be allowed to ferment longer, up to a day, to yield a stronger, more sour, and acidic taste, which some people prefer. Longer fermentation produces vinegar instead of stronger wine.

==Distilled==
Palm wine may be distilled to create a stronger drink, which goes by different names depending on the region (e.g., &quot;arrack&quot;, &quot;palm feni&quot;, &quot;sopi&quot;, &quot;village gin&quot;, &quot;charayam&quot;, and &quot;country whiskey&quot;).

In Nigeria, this is commonly called palm wine. In southwestern Nigeria and some parts of Cameroon, it is also known as &quot;Emu&quot; or &quot;Matango&quot;. In both Congos, it is called &quot;nsámbá&quot;. In parts of southern Ghana, distilled palm wine is called &quot;akpeteshi&quot; or &quot;burukutu&quot;. In Togo and Benin, it is called &quot;sodabe&quot;, while in Tunisia it is called &quot;lagmi&quot;. In coastal parts of Kenya, it is known as &quot;mnazi&quot;. In India, it is called &quot;toddy&quot;. In Ivory Coast, it is called &quot;koutoukou&quot;.

In the Philippines, the most common distilled palm liquor is &quot;lambanog&quot; which is made from aged &quot;tubâ&quot;. It has very high alcohol by volume, at 40 to 45% abv (80 to 90 proof).

==Consumption by region==

===Africa===
In Africa, the sap used to create palm wine is most often taken from wild date palms such as the silver date palm (&quot;Phoenix sylvestris&quot;), the palmyra, and the jaggery palm (&quot;Caryota urens&quot;), or oil palm such as the African Oil Palm (&quot;Elaeis guineense&quot;) or from &quot;Raffia palms&quot;, &quot;kithul&quot; palms, or &quot;nipa&quot; palms. In part of the central and western Democratic Republic of the Congo, palm wine is called &quot;malafu&quot;. 

Palm wine plays an important role in many ceremonies in many tribes and nations of Nigeria such as among the Igbo and Yoruba peoples, and elsewhere in Central and Western Africa. Guests at weddings, birth celebrations, funerals, and gatherings to observe important festivals and holidays are served in generous quantities. Palm wine is often infused with medicinal herbs to remedy a wide variety of physical complaints. As a token of respect to deceased ancestors, many drinking sessions begin with a small amount of palm wine spilled on the ground (&quot;Kulosa malafu&quot; in Kikongo ya Leta). Palm wine is enjoyed by men and women, although women usually drink it in less public venues.

In parts of southeastern Nigeria, namely Igboland, palm wine is locally referred to as &quot;mmanya ocha&quot; (literally, &quot;white drink&quot;), with &quot;ngwo&quot; and &quot;nkwu&quot; variants. It plays a very important role in traditional Igbo settings. In Urualla, for instance, and other &quot;ideato&quot; towns, it is the drink of choice for traditional weddings. A young man who is going for the first introduction at his in-laws&#x27; house is required to bring palm wine with him. There are varying gallons of palm wine required, depending on the customs of the different regions in Igboland. This culture can be observed similarly in the neighboring north-western regions of Cameroon. (North West Region).

Poyo is a fermented drink made in Sierra Leone from various species of palm trees. In Sierra Leone, poyo plays an important role among the local people. According to the Limbas people, one of the oldest ethnic groups in Sierra Leone, he who brings poyo brings life. It is served at weddings, birth celebrations and funeral wakes.

There are four types of palm wine in the central and southern Democratic Republic of the Congo. From the oil palm comes &quot;ngasi&quot;, &quot;dibondo&quot; comes from the raffia palm, &quot;cocoti&quot; from the coconut palm, and &quot;mahusu&quot; from a short palm that grows in the savannah areas of western Bandundu and Kasai provinces.

===South Asia===
In South Asian countries such as Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka, coconut palms and Palmyra palms such as the &quot;Arecaceae&quot; and &quot;Borassus&quot; are preferred. It is mainly produced from the lala palm (&quot;Hyphaene coriacea&quot;) by cutting the stem and collecting the sap. In some areas of India, palm wine is evaporated to produce the unrefined sugar called jaggery.


In parts of India, the unfermented sap is called &quot;neera&quot; ( in Tamil Nadu) and is refrigerated, stored, and distributed by semi-government agencies. A small amount of lime (calcium hydroxide) is added to the sap to prevent it from fermenting. &quot;Neera&quot;, similar to fruit juice products, is relatively rich in potassium.

In India, palm wine or toddy is served as either &quot;neera&quot; or (a sweet, non-alcoholic beverage derived from fresh sap) or (a sour beverage made from fermented sap, but not as strong as wine). Palm sap contains natural yeasts, which perform the fermentation of glucose to alcohol, as well as acetobacter, which subsequently converts the alcohol to acetic acid (vinegar). The optimal consumption time is one day after tapping when the vinegar content is minimal; beyond this time, it becomes increasingly sour. Some palm wine drinkers prefer their beverage more sour than usual, but fermenting for too long will result in vinegar rather than wine. Refrigeration extends beverage life, as do a variety of spices, which also contribute to flavor.

In India, palm wine is usually available at toddy shops (known as in Malayalam, in Tamil, in Tulu, in Telugu, in Kannada). In Tamil Nadu, this beverage is currently banned, though the legality fluctuates with politics. In the absence of legal toddy, moonshine distillers of arrack often sell methanol-contaminated alcohol, which can have lethal consequences. To discourage this practice, authorities have pushed for inexpensive &quot;Indian Made Foreign Liquor&quot; (IMFL).

In the states of Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh (India), toddy is a popular drink in rural parts that is frequently consumed at the end of the day after work.

There are two main types of toddy () in the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, namely (Telugu: తాటికల్లు) (from Toddy Palmyra trees) and (Telugu: ఈతకల్లు) (from silver date palms). is very sweet and less intoxicating, whereas is stronger (sweet in the morning, becoming sour to bitter-sour in the evening) and is highly intoxicating. People enjoy right at the trees where it is brought down. They drink out of leaves by holding them to their mouths while the Goud pours the from the (kallu pot). There are different types of toddy according to the season: , , . .

In the Indian state of Kerala, toddy is used in leavening (as a substitute for yeast) a local form of hopper called the . Toddy is mixed with rice dough and left overnight to aid in fermentation and expansion of the dough causing the dough to rise overnight, making the bread soft when prepared.

In Kerala, toddy is sold under a license issued by the excise department and it is an industry having more than 50,000 employees with a welfare board under the labor department. It is also used in the preparation of a soft variety of Sanna, which is famous in the parts of Karnataka and Goa in India.

===Indonesia and Malaysia===
&quot;Tuak&quot;, which can refer to both palm wine and rice wine, is imbibed in Sumatra, Sulawesi, Kalimantan, and Bali of Indonesia and parts of Malaysia such as Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia. The beverage is a popular drink among the Kadazan-Dusun, Ibans, and Dayaks during the Gawai and Kaamatan festivals, weddings, hosting of guests, and other special occasions. The Batak people of North Sumatra also consume palm wine, with palm sap mixed with raru bark to make Tuak. The brew is served at stalls along with snacks. The same word is used for other drinks in Indonesia, for example, those made using fermented rice.

===Singapore===
Palm toddy was historically a popular working-class drink, particularly for the Indian community, since it was cheaper than beer. Sales were restricted to drinking on premises at government-run toddy shops, the last of which closed in 1979. Legal sales resumed in 2022 when a first batch was imported from Malaysia.

===Mexico===

Mexican &quot;tuba&quot; made from coconut sap is common in western Mexico, especially in the states of Colima, Jalisco, Michoacán, and Guerrero. Coconuts are not native to the Americas. They were introduced to Mexico from the Philippines via the Manila Galleons to Acapulco, along with &quot;tuba&quot; manufacturing. Mexican &quot;tuba&quot; is made in the same way as Filipino &quot;tubâ&quot;. The traditional sap collectors are known as &quot;tuberos&quot; (which also means &quot;plumber&quot; in both Mexico and the Philippines). It became so popular that in 1619, Captain Sebastian de Piñeda wrote to King Philip III of Spain complaining about the Filipino &quot;Indio&quot; settlers in Nueva España who were causing significant loss of profits to Iberian alcohol exporters due to &quot;tuba&quot;.

Mexican &quot;tuba&quot; is also commonly sold as &quot;tuba fresca&quot;, a non-alcoholic version made from fresh coconut sap. It is traditionally sold by street vendors in large bottle gourds mixed with coconut milk, ice, and sugar. It is usually topped with peanuts and diced fruit.

===Philippines===
Palm wines are widely consumed in the Philippines and are part of the traditional palm vinegar industry. They are gathered mostly from coconuts, nipa palms, or kaong palms. Palm wines fermented for a few days to a few weeks are generally referred to as tubâ. There are two notable traditional derivations of tubâ with higher alcohol contents. The first is distilled liquor, generally known as &quot;lambanog&quot; (coconut) and &quot;laksoy&quot; (nipa palm). They are milky white to clear in colour. The second is the &quot;bahalina&quot; which is typically deep brown-orange due to the use of bark extracts from the mangrove &quot;Ceriops tagal&quot;.

Other types of palm wines indigenous to the islands include subtypes of tubâ like &quot;tuhak&quot; or &quot;tubâ sa hidikup&quot; which is made from kaong palm sap, and &quot;tunggang&quot; which is made from fishtail palm sap.

On the island of Leyte in the central Philippines, the red &quot;tubâ&quot; is aged with the tanbark for up to six months to two years, until it gets dark red, and tapping its glass container gives off a deep hollow sound. This type of &quot;tubâ&quot; is called &quot;bahal&quot; (for &quot;tubâ&quot; aged this way for up to six months) and &quot;bahalina&quot; (for &quot;tubâ&quot; aged thus for up to a year or more).

===South America===
Production of palm wine may have contributed to the endangered status of the Chilean wine palm (&quot;Jubaea chilensis&quot;).

===Other areas===
In Tuvalu, the process of making toddy can be seen with tapped palm trees that line Funafuti International Airport.
In Kiribati, it is called Karewe and freshly tapped sap from coconut spathe is used as a refreshing drink and the fermented sap is used as an alcoholic beverage. Karewe is boiled to reduce into a thick light brown liquid, called &quot;kamwaimwai&quot;, used as a sweetener and spread.

==Consumption by animals==
Some small pollinating mammals consume large amounts of fermented palm nectar as part of their diet, especially the Southeast Asian pen-tailed treeshrew. The inflorescences of the bertam palm contain populations of yeast that ferment the nectar in the flowers to up to 3.8% alcohol (average: 0.6%). The treeshrews metabolise the alcohol very efficiently and do not appear to become drunk from the fermented nectar.

Megabats have been known to drink from containers of harvested palm sap and then urinate into the containers, leading to the transmission of the Nipah virus.

==Names==

There are a variety of regional names for palm wine:


==Gallery==
==In popular culture==
The tapping and consumption of palm wine are recurrent motifs in the Chinua Achebe novel &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, and in the Amos Tutuola novel &quot;The Palm-Wine Drinkard&quot;. It is also mentioned in the 2006 movie &quot;Blood Diamond&quot;.

<text>Main-Taunus is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the middle of Hessen, Germany and is part of the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region as well as the Frankfurt urban area. Neighboring districts are Hochtaunuskreis, district-free Frankfurt, Groß-Gerau, district-free Wiesbaden, Rheingau-Taunus. It is the second most densely populated rural district in Germany.

==History==

Before the era of Napoleon, the area was divided into many small bits and pieces of independent states. The most prominent of these were the Archbishopric of Mainz and the territory ruled by the Lords of Eppstein, who were later succeeded by the Landgraves of Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1806 the area became united for the first time as part of the Duchy of Nassau, which was annexed to Prussia in 1866. In 1928 the Main-Taunus district was formed when the cities of Wiesbaden and Frankfurt annexed adjoining areas, leaving the remaining unincorporated areas in the former districts of Wiesbaden and Höchst too small to survive on their own. Together with some adjoining area in the north, these bits and pieces were merged into the Main-Taunus district. In 1972 the northern part of the district was transferred to the Hochtaunus district, and in 1977 the westernmost parts became parts of the city Wiesbaden and the newly formed district Rheingau-Taunus. In 1980 the administrative seat was moved from Frankfurt-Höchst to Hofheim.

==Geography==
The district covers the southern part of the Taunus mountains, with the Main river forming part of the district&#x27;s border in the south. The district covers the smallest area of any rural district in Germany.

==Coat of arms==
The upper part of the coat of arms shows the wheel of the Archbishopric of Mainz, the bottom part shows the bars of the Lords of Eppstein.

<text>Louis Zocchi is a gaming hobbyist, former game distributor and publisher, and maker and seller of polyhedral game dice. In 1986, he was elected to the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame.

==Career==
Lou Zocchi was one of the first editors for Avalon Hill&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The General&quot;, and a regular contributor during its first 11 years of publication. He also playtested such early wargames as &quot;Bismark&quot;, &quot;Afrika Korps&quot;, &quot;Jutland&quot;, &quot;Stalingrad&quot;, and a number of titles Avalon Hill did not publish. Zocchi was the first U.S. distributor to sell nothing but adventure games. As a board wargame designer, his credits include &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, &quot;The Battle of Britain&quot;, &quot;Alien Space&quot;, and &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;, as well as the 3-, 5-, 14-, 24-, and 100-sided die. Zocchi contributed to the series of books by Guidon Games that began in 1971 with &quot;Chainmail&quot;. Zocchi produced the superhero RPG &quot;&quot; in 1977.

Zocchi also designed and published the &quot;Star Fleet Battle Manual&quot; (1977) miniatures rules, which he licensed from Franz Joseph, and in 1979 Zocchi&#x27;s friend Stephen Cole licensed the rights from Joseph to publish the &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; game. Zocchi also distributed the Wee Warriors line after 1977. Zocchi helped Judges Guild with their financial difficulties in the early 1980s by paying them $350 every time they gave him the rights to reprint their out-of-print supplements. Mike Hurdle of Holly Springs, Mississippi purchased Zocchi Distribution in February 1998.

Zocchi and his company GameScience have published a number of games over the years (many designed by Zocchi), but are best known for making dice and inventing the Zocchihedron (100-sided) die. 

Zocchi has designed a few games himself, including &quot;Hardtack&quot;, and &quot;Battle Wagon Salvo&quot;.

In 1987, Zocchi was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming&#x27;s Hall of Fame. He was honored as a &quot;famous game designer&quot; by being inducted into the Game Designers Hall of Fame and featured as the king of clubs in Flying Buffalo&#x27;s 2009 Famous Game Designers Playing Card Deck.

GameScience is still trading, and () Zocchi is still active in the gaming community.

He later joined the AL.S.D.F. force and held the rank of Colonel.

==Study of dice==
Most dice, according to Zocchi, do not roll accurately because of flawed manufacturing processes. The dice favor certain numbers and are more likely to land on those numbers. Zocchi believes the &quot;superstition&quot; of many gamers who use specific dice to roll high and others to roll low results from the fact that major dice manufacturers smooth out the straight edges of their dice in machines much like rock tumblers. The result is that plastic dice originally molded evenly are unevened and unbalanced, making them more likely to land on some numbers than on others.

Zocchi demonstrates the imperfections of dice with statistical results (showing uneven distribution of rolled die values) and with photographs of uneven die edges, faces and vertices. His demonstrations are sales pitches for his precision edged dice (with sharp edges) manufactured by his company, GameScience. Tests by Jason Mills in 1987 and published in &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine showed that his Zocchihedron had a significantly uneven number distribution. Right after that article came out, Zocchi adjusted the numbering of the Zocchihedron to correct the distribution and claims that the d100 now rolls rightly, whereas the original Zocchihedron had all the mid-range numbers clustered at the equator. The modified layout assigns one number from each tens-cluster to each ring of numbers around the die. Only white dice with black numbers use the older number distribution. Corrected dice are manufactured in other colors. However, while this &quot;correction&quot; will prevent the Zocchihedron from biasing against very high and very low numbers, the distribution of the individual numbers themselves will remain to be proven by tests.

Due to safety concerns, the 4-sided die (or d4) produced by GameScience has truncated points.

Zocchi has invented and produced several &quot;non-standard&quot; dice. These are a 3-sided die, a 5-sided die, a 14-sided die, a 16-sided die, and a 24-sided die. All these except the 7-sided (d7) are available in high-impact translucent plastic. The 7 sided die Zocchi was invented by Bernard Beruter of Canada.

==How to $ell Your Wargame Design==
How to $ell Your Wargame Design is a book about how to successfully sell a board wargame design that was written and self-published by Zocchi in 1975. As game designer Stephen V. Cole noted, Zocchi ran a seminar every year at Gen Con on &quot;starting a game company and selling your wargame design.&quot; Zocchi distilled this into a 16-page book that he self-published, &quot;How to $ell Your Wargame Design&quot;, with the intent to help other game designers get their games published. The book includes a list of game publishers, as well as various publishing goods and services for the person wanting to self-publish.

===Reception===
In Issue 35 of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; January 1981), American game designer Steve Jackson noted the book&#x27;s largest drawback was that it verged on being out of date: &quot;Most of the basic advice is still sound, but many of the names on those lists are certainly obsolete. And &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; take the copyright advice. The laws have changed since Lou wrote this book.&quot; Jackson also warned that the result would not be pretty, since Zocchi was advising self-publishers how to save money. &quot;It tells you how to do a cheap-looking job without spending every cent you own.&quot; Despite this, Jackson concluded, &quot;On the whole, I recommend this book highly. I wish I&#x27;d seen it a year ago. If you ever intend to see a design professionally, order this one.&quot;

<text>Wang Anshi (; ; December 8, 1021 – May 21, 1086), courtesy name Jiefu (), was a Chinese economist, philosopher, poet, and politician during the Song dynasty. He served as chancellor and attempted major and controversial socioeconomic reforms known as the New Policies. These reforms constituted the core concepts of the Song-dynasty Reformists, in contrast to their rivals, the Conservatives, led by the Chancellor Sima Guang.

Wang Anshi&#x27;s ideas are usually analyzed in terms of the influence the &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot; or Legalism had on him. His economic reforms included increased currency circulation, breaking up of private monopolies, and early forms of government regulation and social welfare. His military reforms expanded the use of local militias, and his government reforms expanded the education system and attempted to suppress nepotism in government. Although successful for a while, he eventually fell out of favor with the emperor.

==Early career==
Wang Anshi was born on 8 December 1021, to a family of jinshi degree holders in Linchuan (Fuzhou, Jiangxi province). He placed fourth in the palace exam and obtained a jinshi degree in 1042. He began his career in the Song bureaucracy as a secretary () in the office of the assistant military commissioner () of Huainan (Yangzhou, Jiangsu province). He was then promoted to district magistrate () of Yinxian (Ningbo, Zhejiang province), where he reorganized hydrological projects for irrigation and gave credits to the peasant. Later he was promoted to controller general () of Shezhou (Qianshan, Anhui province). In 1060, he was sent to Kaifeng as assistant in the herd office () and then prefect () of Changzhou, commissioner for judificial affairs () in Jiangnan East, assistant in the Financial Commission (), and finally editor of imperial edicts ().

Wang&#x27;s mother died and he observed a mourning period from 1063 to 1066. In 1067, he became governor of Jiangning (Nanjing).

== New Policies ==

===Background===
During his time in the local administration, Wang Anshi gained an understanding of the difficulties experienced by local officials and the common people. In 1058, he sent a letter ten thousand characters long (&quot;Wanyanshu&quot;; /&quot;Yanshishu&quot;; /&quot;Shang Renzong Huangdi yanshi shu&quot;; ) to Emperor Renzong of Song (r. 1022–1063), in which he suggested reforms to the administration in order to solve financial and organizational problems. In the letter he blamed the downfall of previous dynasties on the refusal of their emperors to deviate from traditional patterns of rule. He criticized the imperial examination system for failing to create specialized workers. Wang believed that there should not be generalists but that people should specialize in their roles and not study extraneous teachings. His letter was ignored for ten years until Emperor Shenzong of Song (r. 1067–1085) succeeded the throne. The new emperor faced declining taxes and an increasingly heavy burden of taxation on commoners due to the development of large estates, whose owners managed to evade paying their share of taxes. This led him to seek advice from Wang in 1069. Wang was first appointed vice counsellor (&quot;can zhizheng shi&quot;; ), a key position for general administration, and a year later was made chancellor (&quot;zaixiang&quot;; ).

===Objective===
The primary objectives of Wang Anshi&#x27;s New Policies (&quot;xinfa&quot;) were to cut government expenditure and strengthen the military in the north. To do this, Wang advocated for policies intended to alleviate suffering among the peasantry and to prevent the consolidation of large land estates which would deprive small peasants of their livelihood. He called social elements that came between the people and the government &quot;jianbing&quot;, translated as &quot;engrossers.&quot; By &quot;engrossers&quot; he meant people who monopolized land and wealth and made others their dependents in wealth and agriculture. Wang believed that suppressing &quot;jianbing&quot; was one of the most important goals. Included in the category of &quot;jianbing&quot; were owners of large estates, rural usurers, large urban businessmen, and speculators responsible for instability in the urban market. All of them had ties to bureaucrats and had representatives in the government.

According to Wang, &quot;good organization of finance was the duty of the government, and the organization of finance was nothing else than to fulfill public duties.&quot; American historian Mary Nourse describes the philosophy of Wang&#x27;s government that, &quot;The state should take the entire management of commerce, industry, and agriculture into its own hands, with a view to succoring the working classes and preventing them from being ground into the dust by the rich.&quot; Wang proposed that &quot;to manage wealth the ruler should see public and private [wealth] as a single whole.&quot; Wang believed that it was wealth that united the people and if wealth could not be administered properly, then even the lowliest men who did not possess political power would rise to take advantage of the situation, take control of the economy, monopolize it, and use it to advance their unlimited greed. Under such a situation, Wang considered any claim that the emperor had control of the people to be just words.

===Implementation===
Wang Anshi was promoted to vice counselor in 1069.

He introduced and promulgated a series of reforms, collectively known as the New Policies/New Laws. The reforms had three main components: 1) state finance and trade, 2) defense and social order, and 3) education and improving of governance.

====Equal tax law====
The equal tax law (), also known as the square field law () was a land registration project meant to reveal hidden land (untaxed land). Fields were divided into squares 1,000 paces in length on each side. The corners of the fields were marked by earth piles or trees. In the autumn, an official was dispatched to supervise the surveying of the land and to place the soil quality in one of five categories. This information was written in a ledger declared legally binding for the purposes of sale and purchase, and the taxation value assessed appropriately. The law was highly unpopular with land owners, who complained that it restricted their freedom of distribution and other purposes (avoiding tax). Although the square field system was only implemented around the region of Kaifeng, the land surveyed made up 54 percent of known arable land in the Song dynasty. The project was discontinued in 1085. Emperor Huizong of Song (r. 1100–1125) tried to revive it but the implementation was too impractical and gave up after 1120.

The system of taxation for mining products () was a similar project to the equal tax law, except for regulating mining projects.

====Green sprouts law====
The green sprouts law () was a loan to peasants. The government loaned money to buy seeds, or seeds themselves from state granaries, in two disbursements at an interest rate of 2 percent calculated at an average of ten years. Recollections occurred in the summer and winter. Public officials abused the system by forcing loans on the peasants or extracting more than 2 percent interest.

====Hydraulic works law====
The hydraulic works law () was meant to improve local organization of irrigation works. Instead of using corvée labor, each circuit was supposed to appoint officials to loan money to the people using the local treasury, so that they could hire laborers. The government also encouraged planting mulberry trees to increase silk production.

====Labor recruitment law====
The labor recruitment law () aimed at replacing corvée labor as a form of tax service with hired labor. Each prefecture calculated the funds needed for official projects in advance so that the funds could be distributed appropriately. The government also paid a premium of 20 percent in years of crop failures. Effectively, it transformed labor service to the government into a monetary payment, increasing tax revenue. However, people who were previously exempt from corvée labor were forced to pay taxes for labor on official projects, and thus protested the new law. Although officially abolished in 1086, the new labor recruitment system existed in practice until the end of the Northern Song dynasty in 1127.

====Balanced delivery law====
The balanced delivery law () was meant to curb the prices of commodities purchased by the government and to control the expenditures of the local administration. To do this, circuit level financial institutions in southeast China were made responsible for government purchases and their transport. The central treasury provided funds for the purchase of low cost goods wherever they were available, their storage, and transport to areas where they were expensive. Critics claimed that Wang was waging a price war with merchants.

====Market exchange law====
The market exchange law (), also called the guild avoidance law (), targeted large trading companies and monopolies. A metropolitan market exchange bureau was set up in Kaifeng and 21 market exchange offices in other cities. They were headed by supervisors and office managers who dealt with merchants, merchant guilds, and brokerage houses. These institutions fixed prices for not only resident merchants but also itinerant traders. Surplus commodities were purchased by the government and stored for later sale at a lower price, disrupting price manipulation by merchant monopolies. Merchant guilds that cooperated with the market exchange bureau were allowed to sell goods to the government and buy commodities from government storehouses using money or credit at an interest rate of 10 percent for six months. Small or mid-sized companies and groups of five merchants could provide guarantee with their assets for credit. After 1085, the market exchange bureau and offices became profit making institutions, and bought cheap goods and sold at higher prices. The system stayed in place until the end of the Northern Song dynasty in 1127.

====Baojia law====
The baojia system, also known as the village defense law or security group law, was a project to improve local security and relieve local government of administrative duties. It ordered groups of ten, fifty, and five hundred men security groups to be organized. Each was to be led by a headman. Initially each household with more than two male adults had to provide one security guard, but this unrealistic expectation was decreased to one per five households later on. The security groups exercised police powers, organized night watches, and trained in martial arts when no agricultural work was required. Essentially it was a local militia with the main effect being a decrease in government expenditures, since the local population was responsible for its own protection.

====General and troops law====
The general and troops law (), also known as the creation of commands law () targeted improving the relationship between high officials and common troops. The army was divided into commands units of 2,500 to 3,000 men that incorporated a mixed force of infantry, cavalry, archers, as well as tribal troops, instead of each belonging to their own individual unit. This did not include the metropolitan and palace army. The system continued until the end of the Song dynasty.

====Three college law====
The three college law (), also called the Three Hall system, regulated the education of future officials in the Taixue (National University). It divided the Taixue into three colleges. Students first attended the Outer College, then the Inner College, and finally the Superior College. One of the aims of the three-colleges was to provide a more balanced education for students and to de-emphasize Confucian learning. Students were taught in only one of the Confucian classics, depending on the college, as well as arithmetics and medicine. Students of the Outer College who passed a public and institutional examination were allowed to enter the Inner College. At the Inner College there were two exams over a two-year period on which the students were graded. Those who achieved the superior grade on both exams were directly appointed to office equal to that of a metropolitan exam graduate. Those who achieved an excellent grade on one exam but slightly worse on the other could still be considered for promotion, and having a good grade in one exam but mediocre in another still awarded merit equal to that of a provincial exam graduate.

In 1104, the prefectural examinations were abolished in favor of the three-colleges system, which required each prefecture to send an annual quota of students to the Taixue. This drew criticism from some officials who claimed that the new system benefited the rich and young, and was less fair because the relatives of officials could enroll without being examined for their skills. In 1121, the local three-college system was abolished but retained at the national level.

== Wang&#x27;s downfall ==
The reforms created political factions in the court. Wang Anshi&#x27;s faction, known as the &quot;Reformers&quot;, were opposed by the ministers in the &quot;Conservative&quot; faction led by the historian and Chancellor Sima Guang (1019–1086). As one faction supplanted another in the majority position of the court ministers, it would demote rival officials and exile them to govern remote frontier regions of the empire. One of the prominent victims of the political rivalry, the famous poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101), was jailed and eventually exiled for criticizing Wang&#x27;s reforms.

Sima and his allies opposed the reforms based on fiscal grounds, but also because they believed that the local elite families rather than the state should be the pillars of society. Fiscally, Wang made it clear that he was not concerned about deficits and promised the emperor that revenues would be adequate even without increasing taxes. Sima did not agree and did not believe that the economy could grow faster than the population. Wang was also in favor of more aggressive foreign policy such as recovering territory and assimilating people to the northwest while Sima preferred a more balanced foreign policy. Sima did not believe that managing wealth was a core function of the government or that it was in their best interests to help those dependent on the rich. He saw that as the breakdown of social order which would cause the eventual downfall of the state. Sima did not even like the imperial examinations and argued that only candidates recommended by court officials should be able to sit the examinations.

Essentially, Sima Guang believed that government was the domain of the pre-existing elite and only the elite. He argued that the empire would be better off if rich families kept more of their wealth. &quot;If (wealth) is in the hands of the state then it is not in the hands of the people,&quot; Sima said in a debate with Wang before the emperor. Other officials argued that the baojia system would prevent local gentry from serving in their traditional roles as military commanders, raising private militias and serving the eyes and ears of the state in the country.

The Green Sprouts program and the baojia system were not conceived as revenue-generating policies but soon were changed to finance new state initiatives and military campaigns. Within a few months of the start of the Green Sprouts program in 1069 the government started to charge an annual interest of 20–30% on the loans it made to farmers. As the officials of the Ever-Normal Granaries who were managing the program were evaluated based on the revenue they could generate, this resulted in forced loans and lack of focus on the disaster relief, which was the original task of the Ever-Normal Granaries.

In 1074, a famine in northern China drove many farmers off their lands. Their circumstances were made worse by the debts they had incurred from the seasonal loans granted under Wang&#x27;s reform initiatives. Local officials insisted on collecting the loans as the farmers were leaving their land. This crisis was depicted as being Wang’s fault. Wang still had the emperor&#x27;s favor, though he resigned in 1076. With the emperor&#x27;s death in 1085 and the return of the opposition leader Sima Guang, the New Policies were abolished under the regency of Dowager Empress Xiang. With Sima back in power, he blamed the New Policies&#x27; implementation on Shenzong&#x27;s wish to extend Song borders to match the Han and Tang dynasties, that they were only a tool for irredentism. The pro-New policies faction regained power when Emperor Zhezong came of age in 1093. The policies largely continued under the reign of Emperor Huizong until the end of the Northern Song dynasty in 1126.

== Poet ==
In addition to his political achievements, Wang Anshi was a noted poet. He wrote poems in the form, modeled on those of Du Fu. He was later ranked number seven among the &quot;Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song&quot; (). He was an adherent of the Classical Prose Movement championed by Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan, first and second of the Eight Masters of the Tang and Song respectively. His poetry often included social themes along with the traditional observations of nature.

==Legacy==

Chinese politicians and historians have continued to look back on the reforms of Wang Anshi as either principled and measured or misguided and disastrous.

The twentieth-century Chinese warlord Yan Xishan cited the reforms of Wang Anshi to justify his use of a limited form of local democracy in Shanxi. Yan believed that the focus and intent of Wang&#x27;s reforms was to strengthen the Song dynasty by persuading ordinary Chinese to give the dynasty their active support, instead of merely serving it. The system of &quot;democratic&quot; government that Yan justified via the philosophy of Wang Anshi was mostly focused on improving Yan&#x27;s own popularity without holding any real power, and never became an effective alternative to military dictatorship. On the other hand, the popular scholar Lin Yutang cast Wang as the equivalent of communist totalitarian government in his biography of Wang&#x27;s adversary Su Dongpo.

<text>Albert François Lebrun (; 29 August 1871 – 6 March 1950) was a French politician who served as President of France from 1932 to 1940. He was the last president of the Third Republic. He was a member of the centre-right Democratic Republican Alliance (ARD).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born to a farming family in Mercy-le-Haut, Meurthe-et-Moselle, he attended the École Polytechnique and the École des Mines de Paris, graduating from both at the top of his class. He then became a mining engineer in Vesoul and Nancy, but left that profession at the age of 29 to enter politics.
===Politics===

Lebrun won a seat in the Chamber of Deputies in 1900 as a member of the Left Republican Party, later serving on the cabinet as Minister for the Colonies from 1912 to 1914, Minister of War in 1913 and Minister for Liberated Regions from 1917 to 1919. Joining the Democratic Alliance, he was elected to the French senate from Meurthe-et-Moselle in 1920, and served as Vice President of the Senate from 1925 through 1929. He was president of that body from 1931 to 1932.

===President===
Lebrun was elected President of France by the newly elected Chamber of Deputies following the assassination of President Paul Doumer by Pavel Gurgulov on 6 May 1932. Re-elected in 1939, largely because of his record of accommodating all political sides, he exercised little power as president.

In June 1940, with the military collapse of France imminent, Lebrun wrote &quot;the uselessness of the struggle was demonstrated. An end must be made.&quot; With the Cabinet wanting to ask for an armistice, on 17 June 1940 Prime Minister Paul Reynaud resigned, recommending to President Lebrun that he appoint Marechal Philippe Pétain in his place, which he did that day. British General Sir Edward Spears, who was present with the French cabinet during this crisis wrote &quot;it is clear that the President had made up his mind that France was free of her obligations to Britain, and was at liberty to ask for an armistice [with Germany] if she deemed it to be in her interests to do so.&quot;

On 10 July 1940, Lebrun enacted the Constitutional Law of 10 July 1940, which the National Assembly had voted for by 569 votes to 80, allowing Prime Minister Philippe Pétain to promulgate a new constitution. On 11 July, Lebrun was replaced by Pétain as head of state.

Lebrun fled to Vizille (Isère) on 15 July, but was captured on 27 August 1943, when the Germans moved into the region. He was then sent into captivity at the Itter Castle in Tyrol. On 10 October 1943 he was allowed to return to Vizille due to illness, but was kept under constant surveillance. 

On 15 August 1944, Operation Dragoon began. One week later, Grenoble, Vizille and other cities were freed. The German 19th Army withdrew quickly.

On 11 October 1944, Lebrun met with Charles de Gaulle and acknowledged the General&#x27;s leadership. Conveniently forgetting the new Constitutional Law he had enacted in 1940, Lebrun said that he had not formally resigned as president because the dissolution of the National Assembly had left nobody to accept his resignation. Whether or not de Gaulle accepted this lie is unknown. During the post-war Petain trial &quot;all the available celebrities of the Third Republic testified, including Lebrun, all whitewashing themselves&quot;. Lebrun argued again that he had never officially resigned. De Gaulle made no mystery of his low opinion of Lebrun, and wrote of him in his memoirs: &quot;As a head of state he lacked two things: there was no state, and he wasn&#x27;t a head.&quot;

===Personal life===
Lebrun was married to Marguerite Lebrun (née Nivoit). Together they had two children: a son, Jean, and a daughter, Marie.

===Later life===
After the war, Lebrun lived in retirement. He died of pneumonia in Paris on 6 March 1950 after a protracted illness.

<text>This is a list of cities in modern Sweden that once enjoyed city privileges, thus were entitled to call themselves town (, plural ). The year indicates the year they were established or when they were granted a royal charter. The list does not include towns in Finland established during Swedish rule.

==Overview==
Legally and administratively, the term is not used in Sweden since the municipal reform of 1971, when the municipality (&quot;kommun&quot;) became the only existing form of local government. Before the reform there were 132 urban centres (133 to 1966) that had the title of .

The urban centres of these municipalities are still called in daily speech and 14 of the municipalities have chosen to continue to call themselves in marketing situations, although several of them now encompass large rural areas following the merger of Swedish municipalities in the 1970s and 1980s. These 14 are: Borås Municipality, Gothenburg Municipality, Haparanda Municipality, Helsingborg Municipality, Landskrona Municipality, Lidingö Municipality, Malmö Municipality, Mölndal Municipality, Solna Municipality, Stockholm Municipality, Sundbyberg Municipality, Trollhättan Municipality, Vaxholm Municipality and Västerås Municipality.

The decision to call themselves has been taken purely for image and marketing reasons. In legal situations the word &quot;kommun&quot; (municipality) must be included in the municipality&#x27;s name and governmental authorities will only refer to them by their legal names.

==List==
=== Notes ===
# Skanör and Falsterbo were joined together administratively in 1754 by the name Skanör med Falsterbo; they merged into a single urban area in the 1960s, still keeping their separate identities as two towns.

== Today ==
Most of the former towns are today urban centres (&quot;tätorter&quot;) and seats of their municipalities. Two seats/former towns and municipalities have a different name: Djursholm is the seat of Danderyd Municipality and Visby is the seat of Gotland Municipality.

A number of suburban towns have grown together with neighbours and are nowadays seldom considered as separate towns: 
* Huskvarna (part of Jönköping)
* Mölndal (part of Gothenburg urban area)
* Djursholm, Nacka, Solna, Sundbyberg (part of Stockholm urban area)
* Lidingö (separated from Stockholm by water, but anyhow often counted to its urban area although according to Statistics Sweden, Lidingö is an urban area of its own)

The following are not seats of their municipalities:
* Gränna and Huskvarna (in Jönköping Municipality)
* Mariefred (in Strängnäs Municipality)
* Marstrand (in Kungälv Municipality)
* Sigtuna (in Sigtuna Municipality where the seat is Märsta)
* Skanör med Falsterbo (in Vellinge Municipality)
* Skänninge (in Mjölby Municipality)
* Torshälla (in Eskilstuna Municipality)
* Öregrund (in Östhammar Municipality)

<text>Kanchanaburi (, ) is a town municipality (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand. The town of lies to the southeast of Erawan National Park within Kanchanaburi Province, approximately 120km west of Bangkok. In 2006 it had a population of 31,327. That number was reduced to 25,651 in 2017. The town covers &quot;tambons&quot; Ban Nuea and Ban Tai and parts of Pak Phraek and Tha Makham, all of Mueang Kanchanaburi District, and parts of &quot;tambon&quot; Tha Lo of Tha Muang District. 

==History==
In the late 18th century, Kanchanaburi was established by King Rama I as a defensive outpost against possible Burmese attacks in what is now Lat Ya Sub-district. In 1833, the town was moved about 16 km to the southeast along the river to its present site during the reign of King Rama III.

From the Ayutthaya period to the Thonburi and Rattanakosin periods, Kanchanaburi was an important outpost to defend against Burmese invasions. The old town was located at Tambon Lat Ya (Khao Chon Kai in the present). In 1831, King Rama III moved the city to the southeast, about 16 kilometers, to set at the confluence of the Khwae Yai River and the Khwae Noi River, which is the location of the town today.

On March 25, 1935, a royal decree was issued for Ban Nuea Subdistrict and Ban Tai Subdistrict, which has an area of approximately 2.08 square kilometers.

==Geography==

Kanchanaburi, where the Khwae Noi and Khwae Yai Rivers converge into the Mae Klong River, spans the northern banks of the river and is a popular spot for travelers. Its location at the edge of a mountain range keeps it much cooler than the other provinces of central Thailand. 

==Economy==
The city has two major commercial districts: the downtown area consists of a grid of several streets with office buildings, shop fronts, and a shopping mall; and the riverfront area businesses are mostly further west along River Kwai Road. Once a year a carnival comes to town and is set up in the area next to the bridge. At night there is a small pyrotechnics display that re-enacts the wartime bombing of the bridge.

The riverfront has skywalk, and next to it is Walking Street. The skywalk is a &quot;12-metre high and 150 metre-long&quot; glass walkway, owned by the local government; to access the skywalk, one must pay [on site] 60 baht to own a pair of plastic shoes.

==Buddhism==
Kanchanaburi is the birthplace of the Buddhist monk Phrabhavanaviriyakhun. It is southeast of the Buddhist temple &quot;Wat Tham Phu Wa&quot; which features a series of grotto shrines within a large limestone cave system. Each grotto features a statue of the Buddha at a different stage of his life. It is the easiest access point to the nearby Tiger Temple (closed) and is also home to a Vipassana meditation center.

==Death railway==
In 1942 Kanchanaburi was under Japanese control. It was here that Asian forced labourers and Allied POWs, building the infamous Burma Railway, constructed a bridge, an event fictionalised in the films &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957), &quot;Return from the River Kwai&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Railway Man&quot; (2013). Almost half of the prisoners working on the project died from disease, maltreatment or accidents. There were four POW camps in or near the city, including Tamarkan which was used as a work camp to construct the bridge. After the completion of the railway line, most prisoners were concentrated in the Kanchanaburi area, and often sent on to Japan or French Indo-China.

At Kanchanaburi, there is a memorial and two museums to commemorate the dead. In March 2003, the Thailand–Burma Railway Centre opened and the JEATH (Japanese-English-American-Australian-Thai-Holland) War Museum dedicated to the bridge and the Death Railway. The city is also home to the Kanchanaburi War Cemetery.

The Chungkai War Cemetery is located about from Kanchanaburi.

== Climate ==
Kanchanaburi has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). Winters are dry and very warm. Temperatures rise until April, which is very hot with the average daily maximum at . The monsoon season runs from May through October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm.

<text>Generalissimo ( ), also generalissimus, is a military rank of the highest degree, superior to field marshal and other five-star ranks in the states where they are used.

==Usage==
The word (), an Italian term, is the absolute superlative of (&#x27;general&#x27;) thus meaning &quot;the highest-ranking of all generals&quot;. The superlative suffix itself derives from Latin , meaning &quot;utmost, to the highest grade&quot;. Similar cognates in other languages include in Spanish, in Portuguese, in French, and in Latin. The Russian word comes from Latin.

Historically, this rank was given to a military officer leading an entire army or the entire armed forces of a state,
usually only subordinate to the sovereign. Alternatively, those of imperial blood or the commanders-in-chief of several allied armies could gain the title.
The military leader Albrecht von Wallenstein in 1632 became the first imperial &quot;generalissimo&quot; (general of the generals) of the Holy Roman Empire. Other usage of the title has been for the commander of the united armies of several allied powers (such as Ferdinand Foch on the Western Front in 1918 or Joseph Stalin on the Eastern Front in 1945), or if a senior military officer becomes a chief of state or a head of government (like Chiang Kai-shek in the Republic of China or Francisco Franco in Spain).

The rank &quot;generalissimus&quot; of the Soviet Union would have been a &quot;generalissimo&quot; but some sources assert that Joseph Stalin refused to accept the rank. In fact the grade was established by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, which did not need the approval of Stalin. The rank of &quot;generalissimo&quot; for Stalin was used also by Western diplomacy.

In the 20th century, the term came to be associated with military officers who took dictatorial power in their respective countries, especially due to the Spanish leader Francisco Franco having this rank. As such, it is used in literature depicting fictional Latin American dictatorial regimes, for example &quot;Father Hilary&#x27;s Holiday&quot; by Bruce Marshall.

<text>The Drudge Report (stylized in all caps as DRUDGE REPORT) is an American-based news aggregation website founded by Matt Drudge, and run with the help of Charles Hurt and Daniel Halper. The site prior to the 2020 United States presidential election was generally regarded as a conservative publication, but its ownership and political leanings have been questioned following business model changes in mid-to-late 2019. The site consists mainly of links to news stories from other outlets about politics, entertainment, and current events; it also has links to many columnists.

The Drudge Report originated in 1995 as a weekly subscriber-based email dispatch. It was the first news source to break the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal to the public, after &quot;Newsweek&quot; decided to &quot;kill the story&quot;.

==Origins==
The Drudge Report started in 1995 as a gossip column focusing on Hollywood and Washington, D.C. Matt Drudge began the email-based newsletter from an apartment in Hollywood, California, using his connections with industry and media insiders to break stories, sometimes before they hit the mainstream media. In its early days Drudge maintained the website from his home in Miami Beach, Florida, with help from assistants in story selection and headline writing. His first assistant was Andrew Breitbart. Breitbart, who described himself as &quot;Matt Drudge&#x27;s bitch&quot;, worked the afternoon shift at the Drudge Report, at the same time as running his own website, Breitbart News, which provided a conservative perspective for people in the Los Angeles entertainment industry. John Ziegler has said that Drudge blocked Breitbart from posting content critical of Barack Obama during the 2008 campaign for the US presidency.

In 2010, Drudge added former &quot;Washington Times&quot; columnist Joseph Curl to the Drudge Report staff. In 2011, he added to the staff Charles Hurt, most recently the Washington bureau chief of the &quot;New York Post&quot; and a columnist for &quot;The Washington Times&quot;. Curl, who served as morning shift editor, left the site in 2014 and, with Drudge&#x27;s blessing, in January 2015 launched his own aggregator &quot;Right Read&quot;, for &quot;The Washington Times&quot;.
Drudge, who began his website in 1997 as a supplement to his $10 per year e-mail newsletter, received national attention in 1996 when he broke the news that Jack Kemp would be Republican Bob Dole&#x27;s running mate in the 1996 US presidential election. In 1998, Drudge made national waves when he broke the news that &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine had information on an inappropriate relationship between &quot;a White House intern&quot; and President Bill Clinton—the Monica Lewinsky scandal—but was withholding publication. After Drudge&#x27;s report came out, &quot;Newsweek&quot; published the story.

==Content==
The Drudge Report site consists mainly of selected hyperlinks to news websites all over the world, each link carrying a headline written by Drudge or his editors. The linked stories are generally hosted on the external websites of mainstream media outlets. It occasionally includes stories written by Drudge himself, usually two or three paragraphs in length. They generally concern a story about to be published in a major magazine or newspaper. Drudge occasionally publishes Nielsen, Arbitron, and BookScan ratings, or early election exit polls which are otherwise not made available to the public.

In April 2009, the Associated Press announced that it would be examining the fair use doctrine, used by sites like Google and the Drudge Report to justify the use of AP content without payment.

On May 4, 2009, the US Attorney General&#x27;s office issued a warning to employees in Massachusetts not to visit the Drudge Report and other sites because of malicious code contained in some of the advertising on the website. In March 2010, antivirus company Avast! warned that advertising at the Drudge Report, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Yahoo, Google, MySpace and other sites carried malware that could infect computers. &quot;The most compromised ad delivery platforms were Yield Manager and Fimserve, but a number of smaller ad systems, including Myspace, were also found to be delivering malware on a lesser scale,&quot; said Avast Virus Labs.

==Design==
The site&#x27;s design has seen few changes since its debut in 1997. Drudge has experimented with temporary, relatively minor design tweaks, including using all black-and-white pictures for a period in August 2017 and using colored text for holidays instead of the standard black throughout the site&#x27;s existence; in all cases, the basic layout remained consistent throughout its existence. It remains entirely written in unscripted HTML, with a mostly monochromatic color scheme of black boldface monospaced font text on a plain white background. The Drudge Report has been described by Cheryl Woodard, co-founder of &quot;PC&quot;, &quot;Macworld&quot;, &quot;PC World&quot; and &quot;Publish&quot; magazines, as &quot;a big, haphazard mishmash of links and photos&quot; and by Dan Rahmel as &quot;popular despite a plain appearance&quot;. 

The Drudge Report website is simple and, according to Paul Armstrong of &quot;webwithoutwords.com&quot;, retro in feel. Jason Fried of Basecamp called it &quot;one of the best designed sites on the web&quot;. It consists of a banner headline and a number of other selected headlines in three columns in monospaced font. Most link to an outside source, usually the online edition of a newspaper, which hosts the story. When no such source is available, either because the story is &quot;developing&quot;, with little known details at the time, or is an exclusive scoop, a special page is created on the Drudge Report servers, which contains text and sometimes images.

Stories on the site are ascribed different levels of importance, which Matt Drudge rates at his editorial discretion. The &quot;Report&quot; almost always holds one major story above the masthead logo, usually just one sentence hyperlinked to the most important story of the day. Other stories surrounding the main headline can be found in the upper left-hand side of the page and link to more specific articles dealing with aspects of the headline story. The standard story, either the headline or links below the logo, is written in black.

The majority of stories are laid out in three columns beneath the masthead. At the bottom of each column are various links: newspapers and magazines in the left column, columnists in the middle column, and a collection of wire service links and miscellaneous links to archives, e-mail, site stats, and a box to submit anonymous tips at the right. &quot;Weather Action,&quot; a static page of links to weather data, and &quot;Quake Sheet,&quot; with earthquake monitoring, each have their own hosted page on the &quot;Drudge Report&quot; servers. The newest stories and those Drudge considers most important are in red, all under a single major headline in large bold type. For especially important breaking stories, especially if they are still emerging, Drudge places art of a flashing red light on the screen.

Although the site initially featured very few images, it is now usually illustrated with five or six photographs. Generally the images, like the linked headlines, are hotlinked from the servers of other news agencies.

==Political leanings==
A study in 2005 placed the Drudge Report &quot;slightly left of center&quot;. &quot;One thing people should keep in mind is that our data for the Drudge Report was based almost entirely on the articles that the Drudge Report lists on other Web sites&quot;, said Timothy Groseclose, the head of the study. &quot;Very little was based on the stories that Matt Drudge himself wrote. The fact that the Drudge Report appears left of center is merely a reflection of the overall bias of the media.&quot; Professor Mark Liberman critiqued the statistical model used in this study on the basis that model assumed conservative politicians do not care about the ideological position of think tanks they cite, while liberal politicians do. The study was also criticized by media watchdog Spinwatch for its methodology and its authors&#x27; ties to conservative think tanks.

In 2009, Matt Drudge said that he is a conservative, but &quot;more of a populist&quot;. Some had regarded the Drudge Report as conservative in tone, and it has been referred to in the media as &quot;a conservative news aggregator&quot;. In 2008, Richard Siklos, an editor of &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine, called the Drudge Report a &quot;conservative bullhorn&quot;. Peter Wallsten, writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, labeled Drudge a &quot;well-known conservative warrior&quot;. Saul Hansell, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, referred to him as a &quot;conservative muckraker&quot;; and Glenn Greenwald was quoted in &quot;New York&quot; magazine in August 2007 as calling him a &quot;right-wing hack&quot;.

Jesse Swick of &quot;The New Republic&quot; notes that the Drudge Report frequently links to stories that cast doubt upon global warming. &quot;[Drudge] loves a press release from Senator Inhofe almost as much as he loves taking pot shots at Al Gore ... It&#x27;s like flashing tasty images of popcorn and sodas between frames at movie theaters, only much less subtle.&quot; Ben Shapiro wrote, &quot;The American left can&#x27;t restrict Internet usage or ban talk radio, so it de-legitimizes these news sources. Ripping alternative news sources as illegitimate is the left&#x27;s only remaining option—it cannot compete with the right wing in the new media ... They call Matt Drudge a muckraker and a yellow journalist.&quot;

In 2015 and 2016, Drudge repeatedly featured pro-Trump headlines during the Republican Party presidential primaries, leading &quot;Salon&quot; and &quot;Politico&quot; to describe Drudge as &quot;all in&quot; for Trump. During the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump of 2019, the Drudge Report began aggregating what CNN Business called &quot;an overwhelming amount of negative news for the Trump White House&quot;. CNN speculated that this meant there had been a falling out. In 2019, Rasmussen Reports reported that Matt Drudge had sold the site and was no longer involved in its operations, which would also explain the change in editorial direction; however, that reporting was not confirmed. 

By 2020, some prominent conservatives—including President Donald Trump—had concluded that the Drudge Report had abandoned its alleged conservative ideology, with Fox News primetime host Tucker Carlson stating, &quot;Matt Drudge is now firmly a man of the progressive left.&quot; In 2020, Austrian social scientist Christian Fuchs of the University of Westminster described the Drudge Report as an alt-right website.

==Business model and viewership decline==
Matt Drudge&#x27;s business entity in Florida is a privately owned limited liability company called Digital, LLC. Drudge applied for and was granted a U.S. Trademark registration for the phrase &quot;Drudge Report&quot; on January 15, 2019, filed on May 15, 2018. The registration excludes the word &quot;Report&quot; from protection outside of the exact two-word phrase use and is for &quot;standard characters without claim to any particular font style, size, or color.&quot;

Revenue for the Drudge Report is driven by advertising that was managed for 20 years by Intermarkets, Inc. During the summer of 2019, after many years of being known for &quot;changing nothing&quot; about the website, Drudge advertising shifted to a new company by the name of Granite Cubed. The current ownership, strategy and outlook for the Drudge Report is held close as private information.

In October 2019, the Drudge Report began linking to articles which were increasingly critical of Trump, reportedly the result of Drudge himself becoming &quot;exasperated&quot; by the president. This coincided with a near 30% decrease in traffic metrics for the Drudge website in the last months of 2019—from a 90 day-ago ranking of #637 in global internet engagement as of July to #844 in December. The site&#x27;s readership briefly rebounded in March 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic escalated, but continued to decline to new record lows as the year went on.

After a Comscore data report showing a year over year decline of 38 percent from August 2019 to August 2020, President Trump tweeted, &quot;Such an honor! Drudge is down 40% plus since he became Fake News. Most importantly, he&#x27;s bleeding profusely, and is no longer &quot;hot&quot;. But others are! Lost ALL Trumpers.&quot;

==Influence==
In 2006, Mark Halperin wrote that &quot;Drudge&#x27;s coverage affects the media&#x27;s political coverage&quot;, effectively steering it towards what Halperin calls &quot;the most salacious aspects of American politics&quot;. In &quot;The Way To Win&quot;, a book written by Halperin and John Harris, Drudge is called &quot;the Walter Cronkite of his era&quot;. Democratic Party strategist Chris Lehane also said in 2006 &quot;phones start ringing&quot; whenever Drudge breaks a story, and Mark McKinnon, a former media advisor to George W. Bush, said that he checked the site 30–40 times per day.

Wallsten analyzed the data derived from a detailed content analysis of print, broadcast and blog discussions during the last five weeks of the 2008 campaign. Rather than the broad impact posited by professional political observers, Wallsten found that, even on issues where the site should be expected to have its largest impact, the stories highlighted on the Drudge Report exert a fairly inconsistent influence over what traditional media outlets chose to cover. Specifically, the time series analysis presented by Wallsten shows evidence of a &quot;Drudge effect&quot; on print and broadcast coverage for only five of the 10 political scandals that received the most attention on the Drudge Report between September 30 and November 3, 2008.

Matt Drudge has been criticized by other media news personalities: Bill O&#x27;Reilly twice called Drudge a &quot;threat to democracy&quot; in response to Drudge disclosing his book sales figures, and Keith Olbermann referred to Drudge as &quot;an idiot with a modem&quot;.

Drudge, along with his website, was labeled one of the &quot;Top 10 anti-Barack Obama conservatives&quot; by the US editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in February 2009.

In addition to its media influence, the Drudge Report has influenced design elements on other sites, some with opposing viewpoints and some which use the same format for listing news. A left-leaning parody site called Drudge Retort was founded in 1998 as &quot;a send-up of Mr. Drudge&#x27;s breathless style&quot;. According to online analytics data for April 2010 from the Newspaper Marketing Agency, the Drudge Report was then—now over ten years ago—the number one site referrer for all online UK commercial newspaper websites.

==Notable stories==
===Monica Lewinsky scandal===
The Drudge Report originally attained prominence when it was the first to report what came to be known as the Lewinsky scandal. It published the story on January 17, 1998, showing that &quot;Newsweek&quot; had turned down the story.

=== Hillary Clinton for President ===
In October 2007, during the early months of the Democratic primary for the 2008 presidential campaign, the Drudge Report broke a story, &quot;Queen of the Quarter: Hillary Crushes Obama in Surprise Fund-Raising Surge,&quot; and, &quot;$27 Million, Sources Tell Drudge Report.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Within minutes, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton&#x27;s fund-raising success was injected via Drudge into the day&#x27;s political news on the Internet and cable television.&quot;

===Swift Boat Veterans for Truth===
During the 2004 US presidential campaign, the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth group made claims about John Kerry&#x27;s war record, which were mentioned by Drudge and investigated by major newspapers and TV networks. The book &quot;Unfit for Command: Swiftboat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry&quot; became a best-seller in part due to its promotion in the Drudge Report.

===Obama photo===
Drudge published a photo of Barack Obama in Somali tribal dress on February 25, 2008, and reported that the photo had been sent to him by a Clinton campaign staffer. The publication of the photograph resulted in a brief war of words between the Clinton and Obama campaign organizations.

===Prince Harry in Afghanistan===
On February 28, 2008, Drudge published an article noting that Prince Harry was serving with his regiment in Afghanistan. Prince Harry was ten weeks into a front-line deployment in Afghanistan that was subject to a voluntary news blackout by the UK press. The blackout was designed to protect Prince Harry and the men serving with him from being specifically targeted by the Taliban. An Australian weekly women&#x27;s magazine &quot;New Idea&quot; had broken the story in January, but it was not followed up at the time. The &quot;New Idea&quot; editors claimed ignorance of any news blackout. Then a German newspaper &quot;Berliner Kurier&quot; published a short piece on February 28, also before Drudge.

Drudge subsequently claimed the report as an exclusive. Chief of the General Staff Sir Richard Dannatt, professional head of the British Army, said: &quot;I am very disappointed that foreign websites have decided to run this story without consulting us&quot;. The Prince&#x27;s tour of duty was prematurely ended, since his unit might have been targeted by large-scale suicide attacks intended to kill the Prince.

===U.S. Senate problems===
On March 9, 2010, The Senate Sergeant-at-Arms claimed that the site was &quot;responsible for the many viruses popping up throughout the Senate...Please avoid using [this] site until the Senate resolves this issue...The Senate has been swamped the last couples days with this issue.&quot; The Drudge Report countered stating that &quot;it served more than 29 million pages Monday without an e-mail complaint about &#x27;pop ups,&#x27; or the site serving &#x27;viruses&#x27;.&quot;

==Controversial stories, errors and questions about sourcing==
===Exclusives===
Research by the media magazine Brill&#x27;s Content in 1998 cast doubt on the accuracy of the majority of the &quot;exclusives&quot; claimed by the Drudge Report. Of the 51 stories claimed as exclusives from January to September 1998, the magazine found that 31 (61%) were truly exclusive stories. Of those, 32% were untrue, 36% were true and the remaining 32% were of debatable accuracy.

===Sidney Blumenthal lawsuit===
In 1997, the Drudge Report reported that incoming White House assistant Sidney Blumenthal may have been perpetrating domestic violence. Drudge retracted the story the next day and apologized, saying that he was given bad information, but Blumenthal filed a $30 million libel lawsuit, &quot;Blumenthal v. Drudge&quot;, in the District of Columbia. After four years, Blumenthal dropped his lawsuit, saying that the suit had cost him tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees. He agreed to pay $2,500 to Drudge&#x27;s Los Angeles attorney for travel costs, claiming that Drudge was &quot;backed by unlimited funds from political supporters who use a tax-exempt foundation.&quot; The Individual Rights Foundation, led by conservative activist David Horowitz, paid Drudge&#x27;s legal fees in the Blumenthal lawsuit. Judge Paul Friedman, a Bill Clinton appointee, noted in the judgment that Drudge &quot;is not a reporter, a journalist, or a newsgatherer. He is, as he admits himself, simply a purveyor of gossip.&quot;

===Alleged John Kerry intern scandal===
During the 2004 presidential campaign, the Drudge Report ran a story in which general Wesley Clark claimed that the John Kerry campaign would implode over an intern affair. The Drudge Report reported that other news outlets were investigating the alleged affair, but removed it from the site shortly afterward when the other news outlets dropped their investigations.

===Alleged Bill Clinton illegitimate child===
In 1999, the Drudge Report announced that it had viewed a videotape which was the basis of a &quot;Star&quot; magazine and &quot;Hard Copy&quot; story. Under the headline, &quot;Woman Names Bill Clinton Father Of Son In Shocking Video Confession&quot;, Drudge reported a videotaped &quot;confession&quot; by a former prostitute who claimed that her son was fathered by Bill Clinton. After a paternity test using a sample of Clinton&#x27;s DNA found on the dress belonging to Monica Lewinsky, a &quot;Star&quot; source told &quot;Time&quot; magazine that &quot;there was no match, not even close.&quot; Drudge reported these findings in 1999, but during the 2016 presidential election Drudge revived the story that the child, Danney Williams, then a 30 year old man, really was Clinton&#x27;s illegitimate son by twisting established facts.

===Alleged heckling of Republican senators by CNN reporter===
On April 1, 2007, the Drudge Report cited an unnamed &quot;official&quot; source claiming that CNN reporter Michael Ware had &quot;heckled&quot; Republican senators McCain and Graham during a live press conference:

However, a video hosted by Rawstory showed that Ware did not make a sound nor ask any question during the press conference.

===&quot;Oprah&quot; and Sarah Palin===
On September 5, 2008, the Drudge Report reported that &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; staffers were &quot;sharply divided on the merits of booking Sarah Palin.&quot; Drudge said that he had obtained the information from an anonymous source. Winfrey responded in a written statement to news outlets by saying, &quot;The item in today&#x27;s Drudge Report is categorically untrue. There has been absolutely no discussion about having Sarah Palin on my show. At the beginning of this presidential campaign when I decided that I was going to take my first public stance in support of a candidate, I made the decision not to use my show as a platform for any of the candidates.&quot; Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s public statement came after she had already endorsed Barack Obama for president on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; in 2007. Drudge was accused by some commentators of planting a false story for political ends.

===Ashley Todd attack hoax===
On October 23, 2008, the Drudge Report published an unconfirmed exclusive story regarding Ashley Todd, a 20-year-old employee of the College Republican National Committee (CRNC) and John McCain volunteer who had allegedly been attacked by a black male for having a McCain sticker on her car in Pittsburgh. The story was reported without a link but as &quot;developing&quot;, with the headline &quot;Shock: McCain Volunteer Attacked and Mutilated in Pittsburgh – &#x27;B&#x27; carved into 20 yr old Woman&#x27;s Face.&quot; The story set off a &quot;storm of media attention&quot; and was repeated by some conservative bloggers and radio talk-show hosts, all citing the Drudge Report as their source. It was also reported in newspapers and on television around the world. The story was confirmed to be a hoax perpetrated by Todd and, according to Talking Points Memo, spread to reporters by McCain&#x27;s Pennsylvania communications director.

The Drudge Report printed a retraction, including links to the news stories detailing that the attack had been a hoax, and that Todd had performed a similar &quot;attack&quot; on herself while volunteering in a local Ron Paul grassroots group. She was later asked to leave the group because of the hoax.

===Birther conspiracy theories===
The Drudge Report included some articles intimating that U.S. president Barack Obama was not an American citizen.

===Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2016 campaign===
On August 8, 2016, the Drudge Report displayed a photo depicting two men helping Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ascend a set of stairs during a campaign stop in South Carolina on February 27, 2016. Afterward, several Twitter accounts in support of Republican nominee Donald Trump used the photo with the hashtag #HillaryHealth. The use of the photo was criticized by several commentators for presenting a dated photograph out of context to mislead readers.

On October 3, 2016, the Drudge Report published a dubious claim that Bill Clinton had an illegitimate child named Danney Williams, an allegation that the site had reported as debunked in 1999 based on a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article.

On December 30, 2016, an article listed on the Drudge Report accused the United States federal government of attempting to bring down its website with a denial-of-service attack. Beginning roughly one week earlier, DDoS attacks had repeatedly taken the site offline for extended periods. Cybersecurity analysts speculated that the attack was on the scale of the 2016 Dyn cyberattack and suggested that only a small number of groups would have the ability to take down a highly trafficked site for extended lengths of time.

The Drudge Report included articles about the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory, as well as conspiracy theories about the murder of Seth Rich.

=== Conspiracy theories about the 2017 Las Vegas shooting ===
In October 2017, Drudge Report included articles with conspiracy theories about the 2017 Las Vegas shooting.

=== Immigration ===
In October 2017, the Drudge Report shared a dubious Breitbart News story claiming that an illegal alien caused the October 2017 Northern California wildfires. The story was rebutted by the Sonoma County&#x27;s sheriff department, which stated, &quot;This is completely false, bad, wrong information that Breitbart started and is being put out into the public.&quot;

In June 2018, the Drudge Report displayed a headline and photo pairing that some perceived as a suggestion that migrant children who had been separated from their parents were violent criminals. The photo was actually that of a group of Syrian children holding toy guns.

<text>Triominoes is a variant of dominoes using triangular tiles published in 1965. A popular version of this game is marketed as Tri-Ominos by the Pressman Toy Corp.

==Composition==
A triomino tile is in the shape of an equilateral triangle approximately on each side and approximately thick. Each point of the triangle has a number (most often from 0 to 5, as in the Pressman version), and each triomino has a unique combination of numbers, subject to the following restrictions:
* Any number is allowed to repeat in the combination. For example, 0-0-0 or 0-0-1 are possible combinations.
* When reading the numbers sequentially clockwise, starting with the lowest value, the numbers are not allowed to decrease. For example, 0-1-2 and 0-2-3 are possible, but 0-2-1 is not allowed.
Given these restrictions, with the six potential values (0–5) commonly seen, there are 56 unique combinations, and thus the standard triomino set has 56 tiles. Larger sets are possible; for example, including 6 as a possible end number would result in 84 tiles.

Tiles are most often made from plastic or resin that approximates the feel of stone or ivory, similar to most modern commercial domino sets. Numbers are recessed into the surface and painted black. Some &quot;deluxe&quot; sets include a raised, brass tack head in the center. This addition to the sets assists in mixing up or shuffling tiles, as the tack head reduces the surface area of the tile contacting the table, so tiles move more freely.

==Playing the game==
===Setup and initial move===
At the start of the game, all of the tiles are placed face down and shuffled. Players randomly draw their starting pieces. The specific number depends upon the number of players: a two-player game uses nine pieces per player to start, three or four players use seven pieces, and five or six players use six pieces. The tiles after the draw are kept face-down for later use.

One player keeps score for all, using columns for each player and cumulative scores.
The player who draws the largest &quot;triple&quot; (all three numbers the same on the tile), begins the game by placing that tile. That player scores 10 points plus the total value of the tile. The exception is that if the triple zero tile is used to start, that player earns 40 points. In this case, the only triple tile held is the triple zero, which would otherwise be trumped by any other triple tile.

If no triple is held by any player, the player with the highest single tile value plays it and scores its value without the 10 point bonus. Tile values are computed by summing the three numbers. For example, the 2-4-5 tile is worth 2+4+5=11 points. When two or more players hold tiles with the same summed value, the next highest counts and so on until there is the highest value tile.

===Placement===

Play proceeds clockwise; each player places a tile from their hand that lines up with the already placed tiles. A valid play of a triomino is similar to that of a domino in that the sides contacting each other must have matching numbers; this means the two numbers at the corners must match with the adjacent tile. A side with a 1 and a 2 will often not match the side the player is attempting to match. If a new tile is being placed such that it would touch two other tiles, then all of the adjacent numbers must match. Where the points of tiles meet the numbers must always be the same; if they are not, someone has been allowed to misplace a tile and the round must be restarted.

Points are scored based on the numbers on the tile played, with additional bonuses applied when special placements are made. After a tile has been placed legally, each number on the newly placed tile is summed and added to that player&#x27;s score. (E.g. 5 + 3 + 1 = 9).

===Drawing penalty===
If a player cannot place a piece using the tiles in their hand, they must draw a new piece from the remaining pile. Each tile drawn penalizes the player 5 points. Players must continue to draw until a matching tile is found or until they have drawn three tiles. If one of the three can be placed the score is the value of the tile placed less the penalty, which may be positive or negative, depending on the placed tile value and number of tiles drawn. If none of these three tiles can be placed the penalty is 25 points.

If there are no remaining tiles left to be drawn and a player is unable to place a tile, they lose 10 points. For example, if there are two tiles left, a player without a tile to be placed may draw them (receiving a penalty -10 in total for the two tiles drawn), and if that player still has no tile that can be played, the additional end penalty is incurred (total penalty -10 + -10).

===Bonus placement scores===

When a player can place a tile that completes a closed hexagonal shape (i.e. the 6th piece &amp; all 3 numbers match), that player receives a bonus of 50 points plus the regular score for a legally placed tile, less any penalty if pieces have been drawn. If a player completes two hexagons in one move the player receives a 100 point bonus.

Bridges are made by matching one side of the tile and the point opposite. If a bridge is completed or a tile is added to a bridge, that player receives a 40-point bonus in addition to the tile&#x27;s points, less any penalty if pieces have been drawn.

===Round ending and objective===
The round ends when no player can place a tile, whether or not all the face-down tiles have been drawn, or when one player runs out of tiles.
# When the round ends because no one can place a piece, then the player with the lowest total value hand gains the value in excess of their hand from each other player. For example, if the total value of the remaining tiles in Player B&#x27;s hand is 15, while Player A&#x27;s remaining hand sums to 23 and Player C&#x27;s hand sums to 27, Player B will receive a total bonus of 20, which is the sum of the differences between B and A (23-15=8) and B and C (27-15=12).
# A player who is able to empty their hand and place their last tile receives 25 bonus points, plus the total of all of the remaining tiles in their opponent(s)&#x27; hands. This is consistent with the prior ending condition, as the player who emptied their hand has the lowest remaining total value (0).

Additional rounds are played until one player reaches a total of 400 points. They are not yet the winner, and may not be: this only signals that this is the last round, even if penalties later reduce their total below 400. The winner is the one who has the most points at the end of this last round.

===Tile symmetry and strategy===

The game includes only 56 out of 76 possible tiles, omitting those tiles in which the numbers appear in clockwise descending order; i.e., where 0-1-2 is a possible tile, the mirror-image reflection 0-2-1 is not. Consequently, there are many situations in which no tile completes a bridge or hexagon. This lack of symmetry means the game has only one of two tile patterns with Cis–trans isomerism, i.e., with three different numbers on the tile.

With only one of the two patterns, there are 21 tiles with one or more of a particular number e.g. there are 21 tiles with one or more &quot;5&quot;. There are 6 tiles with any combination of two numbers e.g. there are 6 tiles with one or more 4 &quot;and&quot; one or more 5. The count to arrive at 56 possible tiles goes then as follows: 
* 21 with at least one 5
* 15 with at least one 4 (and no 5)
* 10 with at least one 3 (and no 4 or 5)
* 6 with at least one 2 (and no 3, 4, or 5)
* 3 with at least one 1 (and no 2, 3, 4, or 5)
* 1 with at least one 0 (and no 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)
The last one is the triple zero obviously. 

Much depends on the luck of the draw, but skill plays a part, even if a small one. Players should be aware that they hold a matching tile or tiles and need to decide whether or not to play them or in which order to play them for their best advantage. They should be aware of potential hexagons or bridges, to avoid misplacing a tile that could be valuable. A player may consider it worthwhile to set up potential hexagons and bridges since this may or may not be to his own benefit; they may even hold the necessary tile to use in his next move. He may feel that placing a tile to which others can be matched is preferable to placing it to form an &quot;impossible&quot; hexagon or bridge.

== Mobile application ==
In 2009, an app for the iPhone was launched which licensed the Tri-ominos brand from Pressman. A new app was launched in 2015, coinciding with Triominos&#x27; 50th anniversary.

== Variants ==
Variants manufactured by Pressman have included &quot;Quad-Ominos&quot;, with square-shaped tiles, and &quot;Picture Tri-Ominos&quot;.

<text>Hat-making or millinery is the design, manufacture and sale of hats and other headwear. A person engaged in this trade is called a milliner or hatter.

Historically, milliners made and sold a range of accessories for clothing and hairstyles. In France, milliners are known as &quot;marchand(e)s de modes&quot; (fashion merchants), rather than being specifically associated with hat-making. In Britain, however, milliners were known to specialise in hats by the beginning of the Victorian period.

The millinery industry benefited from industrialization during the nineteenth century. In 1889 in London and Paris, over 8,000 women were employed in millinery, and in 1900 in New York, some 83,000 people, mostly women, were employed in millinery. Though the improvements in technology provided benefits to milliners and the whole industry, essential skills, craftsmanship, and creativity are still required. Since hats began to be mass-manufactured and sold as ready-to-wear in department stores, the term &quot;milliner&quot; is usually used to describe a person who applies traditional hand-craftsmanship to design, make, sell or trim hats primarily for a mostly female clientele.

Many prominent fashion designers, including Rose Bertin, Jeanne Lanvin, and Coco Chanel, began as milliners.

==Origin==
The term &quot;milliner&quot; or &quot;Milener&quot; originally meant someone from Milan, in northern Italy, in the early 16th century. It referred to Milanese merchants who sold fancy bonnets, gloves, jewellery and cutlery. In the 16th to 18th centuries, the meaning of &quot;milliner&quot; gradually changed in meaning from &quot;a foreign merchant&quot; to &quot;a dealer in small articles relating to dress&quot;. Although the term originally applied to men, from 1713 &quot;milliner&quot; gradually came to mean a woman who makes and sells bonnets and other accessories for women.

== Learning of millinery ==
Milliners work independently based on job order specifications or their designs, observing the regulations regarding work safety, health protection, environmental protection, and ensuring quality and efficiency. They combine their uniqueness, innovation, and technical skills and use different materials and auxiliary materials. In some cases, they plan and organize their schedules in cooperation with their customers&#x27; various needs. They also collaborate with the team or the apprentice to the presentation and sale of the products.

The millinery industry&#x27;s apprenticeship culture is commonly seen since the 18th century, while milliner was more like a stylist and created hats or bonnets to go with costumes and chose the laces, trims, and accessories to complete an ensemble piece. Millinery apprentices learned hat-making and styling, running the business, and skills to communicate with customers. Nowadays, this apprenticeship is still a standard process for the students who freshly graduated from the millinery schools. Many well-known milliners experienced this stage. For example, Rose Bertin was an apprentice to a successful fashion merchant Mademoiselle Pagelle before her success.

There are many renowned millinery schools located in Europe, especially in London, Paris, and Italy. During COVID-19, many millinery courses were taught virtually.

== Special tools and materials used by milliners ==
A wooden hat block is an intricately carved wood form shaped by skillful woodworkers. Hat blocks are the tools of the trade for milliners in creating a unique hat crown shape. Some of the hat blocks are ensembles with crown and brimmed, while some are only with crown or brim or designed for fascinators. Milliners always have an extensive collection of different hat blocks because there are specific hat sizes and custom shapes for every hat block. In the blocking process of a hat, milliners used push pins and a hammer to hold the adjustable string along the crown&#x27;s collar and the brim&#x27;s edge.

A floral-making iron is a unique iron used by milliners to create different floral petals or leaves as the ornament for hat decoration. In the past, candles were used to heat these irons with various shapes of metal in one set. Nowadays, these irons are electric. A ball-shaped metal heading is commonly used for the curve of floral pastels.

Milliners often use buckram, a stiff cotton (occasionally linen or horse hair) cloth with a loose weave. Millinery buckram is impregnated with a starch which allows it to be softened in water, pulled over a hat block, and left to dry into a hard shape. Millinery buckram comes in many weights, including lightweight or baby buckram (often used for children&#x27;s and dolls&#x27; hats), single-ply buckram, and double buckram (also known as &quot;theatrical buckram&quot; or &quot;crown buckram&quot;).

<text>Kanchanaburi (, ) is the largest of the western provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand. The neighboring provinces are (clockwise, from the north) Tak, Uthai Thani, Suphan Buri, Nakhon Pathom, and Ratchaburi. In the west it borders Kayin State, Mon State, and the Tanintharyi Region of Myanmar.

Tourists are attracted by the history of its ancient civilization and the World War II Bridge over the River Kwai, originally spelt &quot;Khwae&quot; but officially changed to Kwai to accommodate the expectations of tourists.

==Geography==

The province is in the west of Thailand, 129 km from Bangkok, and covers a total area of approximately . It is the country&#x27;s third largest province, after Nakhon Ratchasima and Chiang Mai. Topographically, it is covered with timber and evergreen forests. The total forest area is or 61.9 percent of provincial area. The district covers the source valleys of the rivers Kwae Yai and Kwae Noi (&quot;River Kwai&quot;), which merge at Kanchanaburi city to form the Mae Klong River.

Bong Ti is a transnational border crossing point, which is expected to gain in importance if the planned Dawei deepwater port project goes ahead, along with a highway and a railway line between Bangkok and the port.

== History ==
Archaeological remains found in Kanchanaburi date back to the 4th century, with evidence of trade with surrounding regions at that time. Very little is known about the historical Khmer influence in Kanchanaburi, but Prasat Muang Sing, one of the country&#x27;s most well-known Khmer sites, provides evidence of their occupation.
Not much was historically recorded about Kanchanaburi province before the reign of King Rama I, but some historians believe that the province was of strategic importance during the Ayutthaya period, since it was on the invasion route from Burma. In 1982, many human and elephant skeletons and swords were found in Phanom Thuan district, leading to speculation that this site might even have been the site of the famous battle of King Naresuan against the Burmese crown prince, most commonly assigned to the Don Chedi district in nearby Suphanburi province.
Most foreigners are mainly aware of Kanchanaburi&#x27;s recent history with the Burma Railway. During the Japanese occupation of Thailand in 1942, both allied POWs and Asian labourers were ordered by the Japanese to build a Thailand-Burma railway. Eventually, more than 100,000 people (16,000 allied POWs and 90,000 local Asian labourers) died from horrific working conditions.

==Symbols==
The seal of the province shows the three stupas on Bantadthong Mountain. They give the name to the mountain pass to Myanmar, called &quot;Three Pagodas Pass&quot;.

The provincial flower is the night-flowering jasmine (&quot;Nyctanthes arbortristis&quot;). The provincial tree is the Moulmein lancewood (&quot;Homalium tomentosum&quot;). The provincial aquatic animal is the Jullien&#x27;s golden carp (&quot;Probarbus jullieni&quot;).

The provincial motto is &quot;The ancient province. The (Three) Pagodas Pass Checkpoint, Gems of Kan, Bridge on the River Kwai. Source of minerals and waterfalls.&quot;

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
Kanchanaburi is divided into 13 districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;). The districts are further divided into 98 subdistricts (&quot;tambon&quot;) and 887 villages (&quot;muban&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Kanchanaburi Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 49 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Kanchanaburi and Tha Ruea Phra Thaen have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 47 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 72 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations – SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

<text>Aneirin (), also rendered as Aneurin or Neirin and Aneurin Gwawdrydd, was an early Medieval Brythonic war poet who lived during the 6th century. He is believed to have been a bard or court poet in one of the Cumbric kingdoms of the Hen Ogledd, probably that of Gododdin at Edinburgh, in modern Scotland. From the 17th century, he was usually known as Aneurin.

==Life==
Some records indicate that Aneirin was the son of Caunus (or Caw) and brother to Gildas. According to this version of his life, he was born at Dumbarton on the River Clyde. However, some scholars debate this parentage, and contend that these records are of later invention and are erroneous. Whoever his father was, Aneirin&#x27;s mother, Dwywei is mentioned in &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;. She may be the same lady who, according to Old Welsh pedigrees, married King Dunod who is generally thought to have ruled in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He may also be kin to another Brythonic poet, Cian Gwenith Gwawd.

Aneirin&#x27;s patrons were the noble Urien and his son, Owain. Owain was slain at the Battle of Catraeth, in which Brythonic warriors of Gododdin went up against the Angles of Deira and Bernicia. Nearly all of the Brythonic warriors were slain and their lands were absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Aneirin wrote &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; after this battle, in remembrance of his fallen patrons and lords, in which he hints that he is likely the sole survivor.

After the fall of Owain, Aneirin is said to have been murdered, either by Eidyn son of Einygan or at the hands of an unnamed Cymric lord, whom the poet had offended by reproaching him in his poem &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; for not coming to the aid of Owain. 

==Reputation==
The &quot;Welsh Triads&quot; describe Aneirin as &quot;prince of bards&quot; and &quot;of flowing verse&quot;. Nennius praises him amongst the earliest Welsh poets or &quot;Cynfeirdd&quot;, a contemporary of Talhaearn, Taliesin, Bluchbardd and Cian. References to Aneirin are found in the work of the &quot;Poets of the Princes&quot; (&quot;Beirdd y Tywysogion&quot;), but his fame declined in the later Middle Ages until the re-assertion of Welsh identity by antiquarian writers of the Tudor period. Today, the reputation of his poetry remains high, though the exact identity of the author is more controversial.

==Poetry==
The works attributed to Aneirin are preserved in a late 13th-century manuscript known as the &quot;Book of Aneirin&quot; (). The language has been partially modernized into Middle Welsh, but other portions in Old Welsh indicate that at least some of the poetry dates from around Aneirin&#x27;s time, and its attribution, therefore, may well be genuine. The work would have survived through oral transmission until first written down, perhaps in the 9th century.

Aneirin&#x27;s best known work is &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;, a series of elegies for the warriors of the northern Brittonic kingdom of Gododdin who, in about 600, fell against the Angles of Deira and Bernicia at the Battle of Catraeth (probably Catterick, North Yorkshire). The poetry abounds in textual difficulties and consequently interpretations vary. One stanza contains what may possibly be the earliest reference to King Arthur, as a paragon of bravery with whom one fallen warrior is compared – the identification is, however, conjectural. The poem tells us that Aneirin was present at this battle and, having been taken prisoner, was one of only two or four Brittonic survivors; he remained a captive until his ransom was paid by Ceneu ap Llywarch Hen.

<text>Ronald Arbuthnott Knox (17 February 1888 – 24 August 1957) was an English Catholic priest, theologian, author, and radio broadcaster. Educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, where he earned a high reputation as a classicist, Knox was ordained as a priest of the Church of England in 1912. He was a fellow and chaplain of Trinity College, Oxford until he resigned from those positions following his conversion to Catholicism in 1917. Knox became a Catholic priest in 1918, continuing in that capacity his scholarly and literary work.

Knox served as Catholic chaplain at the University of Oxford from 1926 to 1939. He completed the &quot;Knox Bible&quot;, a new English translation of the Latin Vulgate Bible that was used in Catholic services during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1951, Pope Pius XII appointed Knox protonotary apostolic &quot;ad instar&quot;, which entitled Knox to the honorific &quot;monsignor&quot;.

Knox published extensively on religious, philosophical, and literary subjects. He also produced several popular works of detective fiction. He is remembered for his &quot;Ten Commandments&quot; for detective stories, which sought to codify a form of crime fiction in which the reader may participate by attempting to find a solution to the mystery before the fictional detective reveals it.

== Early life and education ==

Ronald Knox was born into an Anglican family in Kibworth, Leicestershire. His father was the Rev. Edmund Arbuthnott Knox, who later became Bishop of Manchester in the Church of England and who was related to the 8th Viscount of Arbuthnott. Ronald&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Valpy French, the first Anglican Bishop of Lahore in what was then part of the British Raj. Both Edmund Knox and Valpy French were prominent Evangelical Anglicans.

Ronald was educated at Eaton House School in London and Summer Fields School in Oxford. In 1900 he entered Eton College as first King&#x27;s Scholar. He enjoyed great academic and social success at Eton, where he was selected for membership in the Eton Society (&quot;Pop&quot;) and became captain of the school. He also began to cultivate an interest in Anglo-Catholicism, which put him increasingly at odds with his own family&#x27;s Evangelical tradition. At age 17, he privately vowed to remain celibate for life.

In 1904 Ronald proceeded to Balliol College, Oxford as the first classics scholar. He won several other scholarships and prizes during his time there: the Hertford Scholarship in 1907; the Craven and Ireland scholarships, the Gaisford Prize for Greek Verse Composition in 1908, and the Chancellor&#x27;s Prize for Latin Verse Composition in 1910. At Oxford, Knox joined Maurice Child&#x27;s fashionable &quot;set&quot;, which was strongly identified with Anglo-Catholicism.

In 1910, Knox was elected a fellow of Trinity College, Oxford. As he was not expected to begin tutorials until 1911, Knox then accepted the job of private tutor to Harold Macmillan, the brother of a friend from Eton, who was at the time preparing to apply for a scholarship to Balliol. However, Macmillan&#x27;s mother soon dismissed Knox, after Knox refused to follow her instructions not to discuss religion with Harold.

==Church of England==
Knox was ordained an Anglican priest in 1912 and was appointed chaplain of Trinity College. During World War I, he served in military intelligence for the British Armed Forces. In 1915, Cyril Alington, the headmaster of Shrewsbury School, invited Knox to join the teaching staff. Knox was long remembered at Shrewsbury as the highly dedicated and entertaining form master of Vb.

==Conversion and ministry==
In 1917 Knox converted to Catholicism and resigned as Anglican chaplain, prompting his father to cut Knox out of his will. In 1918, Knox was ordained a Catholic priest and in 1919 joined the staff of St Edmund&#x27;s College in Ware, Hertfordshire, remaining there until 1926. Knox explained his spiritual journey in &quot;A Spiritual Aeneid&quot;, published by Longmans in 1918. Knox stated that his conversion was influenced in part by G. K. Chesterton, who was a High Church Anglican at the time, but not yet a Catholic. In 1922, Chesterton converted to Catholicism and said that Knox had influenced his decision.

Knox wrote and broadcast on Christianity and other subjects. While chaplain at the University of Oxford (1926–1939) and after his elevation to a monsignor in 1936, he wrote classic detective stories. In 1929 Knox codified the rules for detective stories into a &quot;decalogue&quot; of ten commandments. He was one of the founding members of the Detection Club and wrote several works of detective fiction, including five novels and a short story featuring Miles Bredon, who is employed as a private investigator by the Indescribable Insurance Company.

In 1936, directed by his religious superiors, Knox started retranslating the &quot;Latin Vulgate Bible&quot; into English using Hebrew and Greek sources. His works on religious themes include: &quot;Some Loose Stones&quot; (1913), &quot;Reunion All Round&quot; (1914), &quot;A Spiritual Aeneid&quot; (1918), &quot;The Belief of Catholics&quot; (1927), &quot;Caliban in Grub Street&quot; (1930), &quot;Heaven and Charing Cross&quot; (1935), &quot;Let Dons Delight&quot; (1939) and &quot;Captive Flames&quot; (1940). When G. K. Chesterton died in 1936, Knox delivered a panegyric for his Requiem Mass in Westminster Cathedral.

An essay in Knox&#x27;s &quot;Essays in Satire&quot; (1928), &quot;Studies in the Literature of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, was the first of the genre of mock-serious critical writings on Sherlock Holmes and mock-historical studies in which the existence of Holmes, Watson, et al. is assumed. Another of these essays, &quot;The Authorship of &quot;In Memoriam&quot;&quot;, purports to prove that Tennyson&#x27;s poem was actually written by Queen Victoria. Another satirical essay, &quot;Reunion All Round&quot;, mocked Anglican tolerance by appealing to the Anglican Church in Swiftean literary style to absorb Muslims, atheists, and even Catholics who had murdered Irish children.

In 1954 Knox visited Julian Asquith and Anne Asquith in Zanzibar and John and Daphne Acton in Rhodesia. While in Africa, Knox began his translation of &quot;The Imitation of Christ.&quot; After returning to Mells in England, he started translating Thérèse of Lisieux&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography of a Saint&quot;. He also began a work of apologetics intended to reach a wider audience than the student one of his &quot;The Belief of Catholics&quot; (1927). In 1957, Knox suffered a serious illness that curtailed all his work. At the invitation of Harold Macmillan, Knox stayed at 10 Downing Street while consulting a medical specialist in London. The doctor confirmed that Knox had terminal cancer.

Knox died on 24 August 1957, and his body was brought to Westminster Cathedral. Bishop George L. Craven celebrated the requiem Mass and Fr Martin D&#x27;Arcy preached the panegyric. Knox was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Mells.

==Radio hoax==
In January 1926, on BBC Radio, Knox presented &quot;Broadcasting the Barricades,&quot; a simulated live report of revolution in London. The broadcast reported the lynching of several people, including a government minister. It also mixed what it called band music from the Savoy Hotel with sounds of the hotel&#x27;s purported destruction by trench mortars. The broadcast also claimed that the Houses of Parliament and the Clock Tower had also been destroyed.

Because the broadcast occurred on a snowy weekend, newspaper delivery was unavailable to much of the United Kingdom for several days. The lack of newspapers caused a minor panic, as people believed that the broadcast events in London were to blame. In May 1926, there was considerable public disorder during the General Strike, so people were previously open to the possibility of a revolution.

In a 1980s interview for his biography &quot;This is Orson Welles&quot; (1992), Orson Welles says that the BBC broadcast gave him the idea for his own 1938 CBS Radio dramatization of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, which led to a similar panic among some American listeners. A 2005 BBC report also suggested that the Knox broadcast may have influenced Welles.

The script of the broadcast is reprinted in &quot;Essays in Satire&quot; (1928) as &quot;A Forgotten Interlude&quot;.

== Knox&#x27;s Ten Rules for Detective Fiction ==
The majority of novels of Knox&#x27;s era, dubbed The Golden Age of Detective Fiction, were &quot;whodunits&quot; with codified rules to allow the reader to attempt to solve the mystery before the detective. According to Knox, a detective storymust have as its main interest the unravelling of a mystery; a mystery whose elements are clearly presented to the reader at an early stage in the proceedings, and whose nature is such as to arouse curiosity, a curiosity which is gratified at the end.He expanded upon this definition by giving ten rules of writing detective fiction:

# The criminal must be mentioned in the early part of the story, but must not be anyone whose thoughts the reader has been allowed to know.
# All supernatural or preternatural agencies are ruled out as a matter of course.
# Not more than one secret room or passage is allowable.
# No hitherto undiscovered poisons may be used, nor any appliance which will need a long scientific explanation at the end.
# No Chinaman must figure in the story. (Note: This is a reference to the common use of heavily stereotyped Asian characters in detective fiction of the time)
# No accident must ever help the detective, nor must he ever have an unaccountable intuition which proves to be right.
# The detective himself must not commit the crime.
# The detective is bound to declare any clues which he may discover.
# The &quot;sidekick&quot; of the detective, the Watson, must not conceal from the reader any thoughts which pass through his mind: his intelligence must be slightly, but very slightly, below that of the average reader.
# Twin brothers, and doubles generally, must not appear unless we have been duly prepared for them.

<doc id="207547" wikidata="Q250568" url="?curid=207547" title="Thābit ibn Qurra">
<text>Thābit ibn Qurra (full name: , , ; 826 or 836 – February 19, 901), was a scholar known for his work in mathematics, medicine, astronomy, and translation. He lived in Baghdad in the second half of the ninth century during the time of the Abbasid Caliphate.

Thābit ibn Qurra made important discoveries in algebra, geometry, and astronomy. In astronomy, Thābit is considered one of the first reformers of the Ptolemaic system, and in mechanics he was a founder of statics. Thābit also wrote extensively on medicine and produced philosophical treatises.

==Biography==

Thābit was born in Harran in Upper Mesopotamia, which at the time was part of the Diyar Mudar subdivision of the al-Jazira region of the Abbasid Caliphate. Thābit belonged to the Sabians of Harran, a Hellenized Semitic polytheistic astral religion that still existed in ninth-century Harran.

As a youth, Thābit worked as money changer in a marketplace in Harran until meeting Muḥammad ibn Mūsā, the oldest of three mathematicians and astronomers known as the Banū Mūsā. Thābit displayed such exceptional linguistic skills that ibn Mūsā chose him to come to Baghdad to be trained in mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy under the tutelage of the Banū Mūsā. Here, Thābit was introduced to not only a community of scholars but also to those who had significant power and influence in Baghdad.

Thābit and his pupils lived in the midst of the most intellectually vibrant, and probably the largest, city of the time, Baghdad. Thābit came to Baghdad in the first place to work for the Banū Mūsā becoming a part of their circle and helping them translate Greek mathematical texts. What is unknown is how Banū Mūsā and Thābit occupied himself with mathematics, astronomy, astrology, magic, mechanics, medicine, and philosophy. Later in his life, Thābit&#x27;s patron was the Abbasid Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tadid (reigned 892–902), whom he became a court astronomer for. Thābit became the Caliph&#x27;s personal friend and courtier. Thābit died in Baghdad in 901. His son, Sinan ibn Thabit and grandson, Ibrahim ibn Sinan would also make contributions to the medicine and science. By the end of his life, Thābit had managed to write 150 works on mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. With all the work done by Thābit, most of his work has not lasted time. There are less than a dozen works by him that have survived.

==Translation==
Thābit&#x27;s native language was Syriac, which was the Middle Aramaic variety from Edessa, and he was fluent in both Medieval Greek and Arabic. He was the author to multiple treaties. Due to him being trilingual, Thābit was able to have a major role during the Graeco-Arabic translation movement. He would also make a school of translation in Baghdad.

Thābit translated from Greek into Arabic works by Apollonius of Perga, Archimedes, Euclid and Ptolemy. He revised the translation of Euclid&#x27;s Elements of Hunayn ibn Ishaq. He also rewrote Ishaq ibn Hunayn&#x27;s translation of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; and translated Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;.Thābit&#x27;s translation of a work by Archimedes which gave a construction of a regular heptagon was discovered in the 20th century, the original having been lost.

==Astronomy==
Thābit is believed to have been an astronomer of Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tadid. Thābit was able to use his mathematical work on the examination of Ptolemaic astronomy. The medieval astronomical theory of the trepidation of the equinoxes is often attributed to Thābit. But it had already been described by Theon of Alexandria in his comments of the &quot;Handy Tables&quot; of Ptolemy. According to Copernicus, Thābit determined the length of the sidereal year as 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes and 12 seconds (an error of 2 seconds). Copernicus based his claim on the Latin text attributed to Thābit. Thābit published his observations of the Sun. In regards to Ptolemy&#x27;s Planetary Hypotheses, Thābit examined the problems of the motion of the Sun and Moon, and the theory of sundials. When looking at Ptolemy&#x27;s Hypotheses, Thābit ibn Qurra found the Sidereal year which is when looking at the Earth and measuring it against the background of fixed stars, it will have a constant value.

Thābit was also an author and wrote &quot;De Anno Solis.&quot; This book contained and recorded facts about the evolution in astronomy in the ninth century. Thābit mentioned in the book that Ptolemy and Hipparchus believed that the movement of stars is consistent with the movement commonly found in planets. What Thābit believed is that this idea can be broadened to include the Sun and Moon. With that in mind, he also thought that the solar year should be calculated by looking at the Sun&#x27;s return to a given star.

==Mathematics==

In mathematics, Thābit derived an equation for determining amicable numbers. His proof of this rule is presented in the &quot;Treatise on the Derivation of the Amicable Numbers in an Easy Way&quot;. This was done while writing on the theory of numbers, extending their use to describe the ratios between geometrical quantities, a step which the Greeks did not take. Thābit&#x27;s work on amicable numbers and number theory helped him to invest more heavily into the Geometrical relations of numbers establishing his Transversal (geometry) theorem.

Thābit described a generalized proof of the Pythagorean theorem. He provided a strengthened extension of Pythagoras&#x27; proof which included the knowledge of Euclid&#x27;s fifth postulate. This postulate states that the intersection between two straight line segments combine to create two interior angles which are less than 180 degrees. The method of reduction and composition used by Thābit resulted in a combination and extension of contemporary and ancient knowledge on this famous proof. Thābit believed that geometry was tied with the equality and differences of magnitudes of lines and angles, as well as that ideas of motion (and ideas taken from physics more widely) should be integrated in geometry.

The continued work done on geometric relations and the resulting exponential series allowed Thābit to calculate multiple solutions to chessboard problems. This problem was less to do with the game itself, and more to do with the number of solutions or the nature of solutions possible. In Thābit&#x27;s case, he worked with combinatorics to work on the permutations needed to win a game of chess.

In addition to Thābit&#x27;s work on Euclidean geometry there is evidence that he was familiar with the geometry of Archimedes as well. His work with conic sections and the calculation of a paraboloid shape (cupola) show his proficiency as an Archimedean geometer. This is further embossed by Thābit&#x27;s use of the Archimedean property in order to produce a rudimentary approximation of the volume of a paraboloid. The use of uneven sections, while relatively simple, does show a critical understanding of both Euclidean and Archimedean geometry. Thābit was also responsible for a commentary on Archimedes&#x27; .

==Physics==
In physics, Thābit rejected the Peripatetic and Aristotelian notions of a &quot;natural place&quot; for each element. He instead proposed a theory of motion in which both the upward and downward motions are caused by weight, and that the order of the universe is a result of two competing attractions (&quot;jadhb&quot;): one of these being &quot;between the and celestial elements&quot;, and the other being &quot;between all parts of each element separately&quot;. and in mechanics he was a founder of statics. In addition, Thābit&#x27;s &quot;Liber Karatonis&quot; contained proof of the law of the lever. This work was the result of combining Aristotelian and Archimedean ideas of dynamics and mechanics.

One of Qurra&#x27;s most important pieces of text is his work with the &quot;Kitab fi &#x27;l-qarastun&quot;. This text consists of Arabic mechanical tradition. Another piece of important text is &quot;Kitab fi sifat alwazn&quot;, which discussed concepts of equal-armed balance. Qurra was reportedly one of the first to write about the concept of equal-armed balance or at least to systematize the treatment.

Qurra sought to establish a relationship between forces of motion and the distance traveled by the mobile.

== Medicine ==
Thābit was well known as a physician and produced a substantial number of medical treatises and commentaries. His works included general reference books such as &quot;al-Dhakhira fī ilm al-tibb&quot; (&quot;A Treasury of Medicine&quot;), &quot;Kitāb al-Rawda fi l–tibb&quot; (&quot;Book of the Garden of Medicine&quot;), and &quot;al-Kunnash&quot; (&quot;Collection&quot;). He also produced specific works on topics such as gallstones; the treatment of diseases such as smallpox, measles, and conditions of the eye; and discussed veterinary medicine and the anatomy of birds. Thābit wrote commentaries on the works of Galen and others, including such works as &quot;On Plants&quot; (attributed to Aristotle but likely written by the first-century BC philosopher Nicolaus of Damascus).

One account of Thābit&#x27;s work as a physician is given in Ibn al-Qiftī&#x27;s &quot;Ta’rikh al-hukamā&quot;, where Thābit is credited with healing a butcher who was presumed to be certain to die.

In his epitome of al-Qifṭī&#x27;s &quot;Kitāb ikhbār al-&#x27;ulamā&#x27; bi akhbār al-ḥukamā&quot;, al-Zawzanī lists seven religious works in Syriac by Thābit and says that he also wrote in Syriac on music and geometry. According to Bar Hebraeus, the 13th-century Syriac historian, Thābit wrote some 150 works in Arabic and 16 in Syriac. He claims to have seen most of the Syriac works himself and lists them. The list of Bar Hebraeus is consistent with that of al-Zawzanī. Most of the works concern pagan religion, but there is a work on music and two on geometry as well as a &quot;book of the chronicle of the ancient Syrian kings, who are Chaldeans&quot; and a &quot;book on the renown of his race and his forefathers, from whom they descend&quot;.

<text>Charles Cowden Clarke (15 December 1787 – 13 March 1877) was an English author who was best known for his books on Shakespeare. He was also known for his compilation of poems as well as his edition of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, which was rendered into prose and widely used.

==Early life and education==
Clarke&#x27;s father, John Clarke, was a schoolmaster in Clarke&#x27;s Academy in Enfield Town, among whose pupils was John Keats. Charles Clarke taught Keats his letters and encouraged his love of poetry. He knew Charles and Mary Lamb, and afterwards became acquainted with Shelley, Leigh Hunt, Coleridge, Hazlitt, William Macready, Charles Dickens, Douglas Jerrold, and William Godwin. Clarke became a music publisher in partnership with Alfred Novello, and married in 1828 his partner&#x27;s sister, Mary Victoria (1809–1898), the eldest daughter of Vincent Novello, who was to become known for her Concordance to Shakespeare, a work that she began in the year following their marriage.

==Career==
Cowden Clarke published many useful books, and edited the text for John Nichol&#x27;s edition of the British poets. His most important work consisted of lectures delivered between 1834 and 1856 on Shakespeare and other literary subjects. Some of the more notable series were published, among them being &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Characters&quot;, chiefly those subordinate (1863), and &quot;Molière&#x27;s Characters&quot; (1865). In 1859 he published a volume of original poems, &quot;Carmina Minima&quot;.

In 1832, the cricketer John Nyren began a collaboration with Clarke, who recorded Nyren&#x27;s reminiscences of the Hambledon era and published them serially in a periodical called &quot;The Town&quot;. The following year, the series of articles appeared as &quot;The Cricketers of My Time&quot; as part of an instructional book entitled &quot;The Young Cricketer&#x27;s Tutor&quot;. It became a major source for the history and personalities of Georgian cricket and also came to be regarded as the first classic in cricket&#x27;s now rich literary history.

For some years after their marriage the Cowden Clarkes lived with the Novellos in London. In 1849 Vincent Novello with his wife moved to Nice, where he was joined by the Cowden Clarkes in 1856. After his death they lived at Genoa at the &quot;Villa Novello.&quot; They collaborated in &quot;The Shakespeare Key, unlocking the Treasures of his Style ...&quot; (1879), and in an edition of Shakespeare for Messrs Cassell, which was issued in weekly parts, and completed in 1868. It was reissued in 1886 as &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Illustrated Shakespeare&quot;. Charles Clarke died at Genoa, and his wife survived him until 12 January 1898. Among Mrs. Cowden Clarke&#x27;s other works may be mentioned &quot;The Girlhood of Shakespeare&#x27;s Heroines&quot; (3 vols., 1850–1852), and a translation of Hector Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Treatise upon Modern Instrumentation and Orchestration&quot; (1856).

See &quot;Recollections of Writers&quot; (1878), a joint work by the Clarkes containing letters and reminiscences of their many literary friends; and Mary Cowden Clarke&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;My Long Life&quot; (1896). A charming series of letters (1850–1861), addressed by her to an American admirer of her work, Robert Balmanno, was edited by Anne Upton Nettleton as &quot;Letters to an Enthusiast&quot; (Chicago, 1902).

<text>Bryan Waller Procter (pseud. Barry Cornwall) (21 November 17875 October 1874) was an English poet who served as a Commissioner in Lunacy.

==Life and career==
Born at Leeds, Yorkshire, he was educated at Harrow School, where he had for contemporaries Lord Byron and Robert Peel. On leaving school he was placed in the office of a solicitor at Calne, Wiltshire, remaining there until about 1807, when he returned to London to study law. By the death of his father in 1816 he became possessed of a small property, and soon after entered into partnership with a solicitor; but in 1820 the partnership was dissolved, and he began to write under the pseudonym of &quot;Barry Cornwall&quot;.

After his marriage in 1824 to Miss Skepper, daughter of Mrs Basil Montague, he returned to his profession as a conveyancer, and was called to the bar in 1831. In the following year he was appointed metropolitan commissioner of lunacy—an appointment annually renewed until his election as one of the Commissioners in Lunacy constituted by the Lunacy Act 1845. He resigned in 1861. Most of his verse was composed between 1815, when he began to contribute to the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot;, and 1823, or at latest 1832. His daughter, Adelaide Anne, was also a poet.

His principal poetical works were: &quot;Dramatic Scenes and other Poems&quot; (1819), &quot;A Sicilian Story&quot; (1820), &quot;Marcian Colonna&quot; (1820), &quot;&quot;, a tragedy performed at Covent Garden with Macready, Charles Kemble and Miss Foote in the leading parts (1821), &quot;The Flood of Thessaly&quot; (1823) and &quot;English Songs&quot; (1832). He was also the author of &quot;Effigies poetica&quot; (1824), &quot;Life of Edmund Kean&quot; (1835), &quot;Essays and Tales in Prose&quot; (1851), &quot;Charles Lamb; a Memoir&quot; (1866), and of memoirs of Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare for editions of their works. A posthumous autobiographical fragment with notes of his literary friends, of whom he had a wide range from William Lisle Bowles to Robert Browning, was published in 1877, with some additions by Coventry Patmore.

Charles Lamb gave the highest possible praise to his friend&#x27;s &quot;Dramatic Sketches&quot; when he said that had he found them as anonymous manuscript in the Garrick Collection he would have had no hesitation about including them in his &quot;Dramatic Specimens&quot;. He was perhaps not an impartial critic. &quot;Barry Cornwall&#x27;s&quot; songs have caught some notes from the Elizabethan and Cavalier lyrics, and blended them with others from the leading poets of his own time; and his dramatic fragments show a similar infusion of the early Victorian spirit into pre-Restoration forms and cadences. The results are varied, and lack unity, but they abound in pleasant touches, with here and there the flash of a higher, though casual, inspiration.

Rather unknown outside Britain in his times and largely considered to be imitator of greater romantic authors, Barry Cornwall however inspired Alexander Pushkin to some translations and imitations in 1830. Just hours before his last duel in 1837 Pushkin sent a collection by Cornwall to a fellow author, Mrs. Ishimova, suggesting that she should translate some poems selected by him.

William Makepeace Thackeray dedicated &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; to B. W. Procter. Wilkie Collins dedicated &quot;The Woman In White&quot; to B. W. Procter.

Thomas Hardy became acquainted with Procter&#x27;s widow, their friendship is mentioned several times in &quot;The Early Life of Thomas Hardy (1840-1891)&quot;.

<doc id="207551" wikidata="Q7507963" url="?curid=207551" title="Sid the Sexist">
<text>Sid the Sexist (real name Sidney Aloysius Smutt) is a character from the British satirical comic &quot;Viz&quot;, first appearing in issue 9 in October 1982. The strip was created and mostly drawn by Simon Donald until he left the magazine in 2003, when Paul Palmer took over as artist.

According to Donald, &quot;Sid is a man who is unable to communicate with women. He is desperate to impress them, but is totally lacking in social skills. He thinks he must use foul and offensive chat-up lines on women to impress his friends, but can&#x27;t see why they don&#x27;t impress the girls. He tries to soften the blow of his outrageous behaviour with nice, friendly Geordie words. Sid thinks that a few &quot;hinnys&quot; and &quot;pets&quot; thrown liberally into his disgusting conversation will win the hearts of women. He usually ends up in hospital having painful procedures to remove things women have shoved where the sun doesn&#x27;t shine.&quot;

==Character ==

Sid and his mates Baz, Bob, and Joe, who are all Geordies, spend much of their time hanging around at the pub, with Sid bragging to them continually about his apparent sexual prowess. Sid &quot;spectacularly fail[s] in the pursuit to which he has single-mindedly committed himself: having sex.&quot; He is a coarse and unsophisticated 30-year-old virgin who still lives with his mother, a fact which often poses as a stumbling block to any potential liaison, and is unable or unwilling to use any kind of decorum when approaching women, instead using outrageously crude lines that never succeed in achieving anything beyond rejection or a violent response from the woman in question. In one of his most famous examples from an early issue of &quot;Viz&quot;, Sid approaches a woman with; &quot;How, pet, my name&#x27;s Sid. D&#x27;ya fancy a fuck?&quot; When answered with a definite &quot;No!&quot;, he replies &quot;Well, would you mind lying down while I have one?&quot;

The recurrent format of Sid&#x27;s adventures is that he believes he has found a new approach to women that will secure him a sexual conquest at long last (&#x27;This time... this time! It HAS to be this time!!&#x27;). His attempts at trying out these questionable methods invariably end up with his being humiliated, often painfully. He is physically very unfit, has a prominent beer belly, drinks heavily, always has a cigarette in his mouth and is cowardly despite his macho pretensions, always coming off the worse in a fight. He is also in denial: despite the misfortunes that befall him he continues to display a blind faith in his crude attitude towards women and, when rejected, often tries to pass the blame for his failures on to the woman in question or somebody else. His exploits have also unintentionally led to several homosexual encounters.

Sid seems under-educated and knows little of the world outside Newcastle. It is even claimed at one point that he is unable to read. It is not clear what his job is, if indeed he has one at all, although he has been seen doing occasional odd jobs as part of his various schemes to pick up women. In another strip he attempts to pick up a woman by telling her that he works as &#x27;an assistant to a well-established provider of goods to the younger end of the market&#x27;; despite being exposed as an elf in Santa&#x27;s grotto in a local department store by his derisive mates, he still attempts to keep up the pretence that his job brings him success with women - &quot;Y&#x27;see, lasses fancy summat [something] a bit special&quot;. Although Sid&#x27;s three companions do sometimes succeed with women, they are much like him in their yobbish, misogynistic, homophobic outlook, never marry or expand their stagnant social circle.

==Recurring Characters==
*Bob is a short man with a wide, flat head, a crooked nose, and a crew-cut whose outfit of choice is jeans and a hooded sweater. Bob thinks most highly of Sid, is often in awe of him and his alleged power over women, is normally the first to encourage Sid in his disastrous attempts at womanising, and usually believes all but the most feeble of Sid&#x27;s excuses for his failures.
*Joe is the tough guy of the group due to his strength, large size, and limited intelligence, but he is a peaceful person, often the one who tries to break up the fights and disputes that break out between Sid, Bob, and Baz.
*Baz is the most successful of Sid&#x27;s friends, often seen wearing a suit or jacket with parted hair and a moustache. Baz is much more openly sceptical about Sid&#x27;s abilities with women than Bob and Joe, once referring to Sid as being &quot;all talk and no tackle&quot;. He is the only one of Sid&#x27;s friends who comes close to seeing through his hollow bragging and is not afraid to suggest to Sid&#x27;s face that he is still a virgin, often resulting in the two falling out or fighting. Baz appears to resemble Adolf Hitler with his hair and moustache.

==Animation/Live Action==

Five animated episodes were produced and released by Polygram Video in November 1992, with storylines taken from earlier comic strips. These were later reissued on DVD in 2004.

In the autobiography of Simon Donald&#x27;s brother, the former Viz Editor Chris Donald, reference is made to attempts by actor Jimmy Nail to bring the character to life in a live action sitcom. However the idea went no further than a lunch meeting at Nail&#x27;s home where it become clear that the plan was a non-starter and was unlikely to find a willing TV station to broadcast the show if it were written in the same style as the comic.

<text>&quot;O My Father&quot; (originally &quot;My Father in Heaven&quot;, also &quot;Invocation, or The Eternal Father and Mother&quot;) is a Latter-day Saint hymn written by Eliza R. Snow, who felt inspired to write the lyrics after Joseph Smith had taught her the principle of heavenly parents.

==Heavenly Mother==
Although references to a Heavenly Mother by church leadership have occurred every few years since Smith first taught the doctrine, the hymn is significant in terms of Mormon theology in that it is perhaps the most prominent and well-known reference to a &quot;Heavenly Mother&quot; in materials published by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

After discussing pre-mortal existence and a sense of belonging to &quot;a more exalted sphere&quot; in heaven, stanza three reasons that if there is an eternal Father there must also be an eternal Mother:

==History==
Snow wrote &quot;O My Father&quot; as a poem under the title &quot;My Father in Heaven&quot; in October 1845 in the home of Stephen Markham in Nauvoo, Illinois. The &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; first published the words on 15 November 1845, more than a year after Smith was killed.

The poetry was later set to the music of another Christian hymn, &quot;My Redeemer&quot; by James McGranahan, and included in Latter-day Saint hymnals, including the current one. When a collection of Snow&#x27;s poems were published in 1856, this work was placed first in the double-volume set and entitled &quot;Invocation, or The Eternal Father and Mother&quot;.
