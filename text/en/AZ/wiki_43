<text>John Edward Redmond (1 September 1856 – 6 March 1918) was an Irish nationalist politician, barrister, and MP in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. He was best known as leader of the moderate Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) from 1900 until his death in 1918. He was also the leader of the paramilitary organisation the Irish National Volunteers (INV).

He was born to an old prominent Catholic family in rural Ireland; several relatives were politicians. He took over control of the minority IPP faction loyal to Charles Stewart Parnell when that leader died in 1891. Redmond was a conciliatory politician who achieved the two main objectives of his political life: party unity and, in September 1914, the passing of the Government of Ireland Act 1914. The Act granted limited self-government to Ireland, within the United Kingdom. However, implementation of Home Rule was suspended on the outbreak of the First World War. Redmond called on the National Volunteers to join Irish regiments of the New British Army and support the British and Allied war effort to restore the &quot;freedom of small nations&quot; on the European continent, thereby to also ensure the implementation of Home Rule after a war that was expected to be of short duration. However, after the Easter Rising of 1916, Irish public opinion shifted in favour of militant republicanism and full Irish independence, so that his party lost its dominance in Irish politics.

==Family influences and background==

John Edward Redmond (the younger) was born at Ballytrent House, Kilrane, County Wexford, his grandfather&#x27;s old family mansion. He was the eldest son of William Archer Redmond, MP by Mary, daughter of General Hoey, the brother of Francis Hoey, heir of the Hoey seat, Dunganstown Castle, County Wicklow.

For over seven hundred years the Redmonds had been a prominent Catholic gentry family in County Wexford and Wexford town. They were one of the oldest Hiberno-Norman families, and had for a long time been known as the Redmonds of &#x27;The Hall&#x27;, which is now known as Loftus Hall. His more immediate family were a remarkable political dynasty themselves. Redmond&#x27;s grand uncle, John Edward Redmond, was a prominent banker and businessman before entering Parliament as a member for Wexford constituency in 1859; his statue stands in Redmond Square, Wexford town. After his death in 1866, his nephew, William Archer Redmond, this John Redmond&#x27;s father, was elected to the seat and soon emerged as a prominent supporter of Isaac Butt&#x27;s new policy for home rule. John Redmond was the brother of Willie Redmond, MP for Wexford and East Clare, and the father of William Redmond a TD for Waterford, whose wife was Bridget Redmond, later also a TD for Waterford.

Redmond&#x27;s family heritage was more complex than that of most of his nationalist political colleagues. His mother came from a Protestant and unionist family; although she had converted to Catholicism on marriage, she never converted to nationalism. His uncle General John Patrick Redmond, who had inherited the family estate, was created CB for his role during the Indian mutiny; he disapproved of his nephew&#x27;s involvement in agrarian agitation of the 1880s. John Redmond boasted of his family involvement in the 1798 Wexford Rebellion; a &quot;Miss Redmond&quot; had ridden in support of the rebels, a Father Redmond was hanged by the yeomanry, as was a maternal ancestor, William Kearney.

==Education and early career==
As a student, young John exhibited the seriousness that many would soon come to associate with him. Educated by the Jesuits at Clongowes Wood College, he was primarily interested in poetry and literature, played the lead in school theatricals and was regarded as the best speaker in the school&#x27;s debating society. After finishing at Clongowes, Redmond attended Trinity College Dublin to study law, but his father&#x27;s ill health led him to abandon his studies before taking a degree. In 1876 he left to live with his father in London, acting as his assistant in Westminster, where he developed more fascination for politics than for law. He first came into contact with Michael Davitt on the occasion of a reception held in London to celebrate the release of the famous Fenian prisoner. As a clerk in the House of Commons, he increasingly identified himself with the fortunes of Charles Stewart Parnell, one of the founders of the Irish Land League and a noted obstructionist in the Commons.

==Political profession and marriage==
Redmond first attended political meetings with Parnell in 1879. Upon his father&#x27;s death later in 1880, he wrote to Parnell asking for adoption as the Nationalist Party (from 1882 the Irish Parliamentary Party) candidate in the by-election to fill the open seat, but was disappointed to learn that Parnell had already promised the next vacancy to his secretary Tim Healy. Nevertheless, Redmond supported Healy as the nominee, and when another vacancy arose, this time in New Ross, he won the election unopposed as the Parnellite candidate for the seat. On election (31 January 1881), he rushed to the House of Commons, made his maiden speech the next day amid stormy scenes following the arrest of Michael Davitt, then a Land League leader, and was ejected from the Commons all on the same evening. He served as MP for New Ross from 1881 to 1885, for North Wexford from 1885 to 1891 and for Waterford City from 1891 until his death in 1918.

By the time of Redmond&#x27;s election, the Land League conflict was by now at a turbulent stage. Early in 1882, he and his brother Willie were sent to Australia on a fundraising mission which was a success in both political and personal terms; in 1883 he and his brother married into the prosperous Irish-Australian Dalton family, and became friends with James Dalton and whom he spent much of his time with. His marriage was short-lived but happy: his wife Johanna died early in 1889 after bearing him three children. He also travelled in 1884, 1886 and 1904 to the US, where he was to use more extreme language but found his contact with Irish-American extremism daunting. His Australian experience, on the other hand, had a strong influence on his political outlook, causing him to embrace an Irish version of Liberal Imperialism and to remain anxious to retain Irish representation and Ireland&#x27;s voice at Westminster even after the implementation of home rule. During the debate which followed Gladstone&#x27;s conversion to Home Rule in 1886, he declared: &quot;As a Nationalist, I do not regard as entirely palatable the idea that forever and a day Ireland&#x27;s voice should be excluded from the councils of an empire which the genius and valour of her sons have done so much to build up and of which she is to remain&quot;.

In 1899 Redmond married his second wife, Ada Beesley, an English Protestant who, after his death, converted to Catholicism.

==Leader of the Parnellite party==
Having belatedly become a barrister by completing his terms at the King&#x27;s Inns, Dublin, being called to the Irish bar in 1887 (and to the English bar a year later), Redmond busied himself with agrarian cases during the Plan of Campaign. In 1888, following a strong and conceivably intimidatory speech, he received five weeks&#x27; imprisonment with hard labour. A loyal supporter of Parnell, Redmond—like Davitt—was deeply opposed to the use of physical force and was committed to political change by constitutional means, campaigning constitutionally for Home Rule as an interim form of All-Ireland self-government within the United Kingdom.
In November 1890 the Irish Parliamentary Party split over Parnell&#x27;s leadership when his long-standing adultery with Katharine O&#x27;Shea was revealed in a spectacular divorce case. Redmond stood by Parnell and worked to keep the minority faction active. When Parnell died in 1891, Redmond became MP for Waterford and took over leadership of the Parnellite faction of the split party. Redmond lacked Parnell&#x27;s oratory and charisma but did demonstrate both his organisational ability and his considerable rhetorical skills. He raised funds for the Parnell Monument in Dublin.

The larger anti-Parnellite group formed the Irish National Federation (INF) under John Dillon. After 1895 the Conservatives and Liberal Unionists, who were opposed to Home Rule, controlled Parliament. Redmond supported the Unionist Irish Secretary Gerald Balfour programme of Constructive Unionism, while advising the Tory Government that its self-declared policy of &quot;killing Home Rule with kindness&quot; would not achieve its objective. The Unionists bought out most of the Protestant landowners, thereby reducing rural unrest in Ireland. Redmond dropped all interest in agrarian radicalism and, unlike the mainstream nationalists, worked constructively alongside Unionists, such as Horace Plunkett, in the Recess Committee of 1895. It led to the establishment of a department of agriculture in 1899. He further argued that the land reforms and democratisation of elected local government under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 would in fact stimulate demands for Home Rule rather than dampen them, as was the case.

==Home Rule and the Liberals==
When on 6 February 1900, through the initiative of William O&#x27;Brien and his United Irish League (UIL), the INL and the INF re-united again within the Irish Parliamentary Party, Redmond was elected its chairman (leader), a position he held until his death in 1918—a longer period than any other nationalist leader, except Éamon de Valera and Daniel O&#x27;Connell. However, Redmond, a Parnellite, was chosen as a compromise due to the personal rivalries between the anti-Parnellite Home Rule leaders. Therefore, he never had as much control over the party as his predecessor, his authority and leadership a balancing act having to contend with such powerful colleagues as John Dillon, William O&#x27;Brien, Timothy Healy and Joseph Devlin. He nevertheless led the Party successfully through the September 1900 general election.

Then followed William O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s amicable and conciliatory Land Conference of 1902 involving leading landlords under Lord Dunraven and tenant representatives O&#x27;Brien, Redmond, Timothy Harrington and T. W. Russell for the Ulster tenants. It resulted in the enactment of the unprecedented Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903. Redmond first sided with O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s new strategy of &quot;conciliation plus business&quot;, but refused O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s demand to rebuke Dillon for his criticism of the Act, leading to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s resignation from the party in November 1903. Redmond approved of the unsuccessful 1904 devolution proposals of the Irish Reform Association. Despite their differences, Redmond and Dillon made a good team: Redmond, who was a fine speaker and liked the House of Commons, dealt with the British politicians, while Dillon, who disliked London, the Commons and their influence on Irish politicians, stayed in Ireland and kept Redmond in touch with national feelings.

Though government had been dominated by the Conservative Party for more than a decade, the new century saw much favourable legislation enacted in Ireland&#x27;s interest. An electoral swing to the Liberal Party in the 1906 general election renewed Redmond&#x27;s opportunities for working with government policy. The Liberals, however, did not yet back his party&#x27;s demands for full Home Rule, which contributed to a renewal of agrarian radicalism in the ranch wars of 1906–1910. Redmond&#x27;s low-key and conciliatory style of leadership gave the impression of weakness but reflected the problem of keeping together a factionalised party. He grew in stature after 1906 and especially after 1910. As far as Redmond was concerned, the Home Rule movement was interested in promoting Irish nationality within the British Empire, but it was also a movement with a visceral antipathy to the English and their colonies.

Redmond initially supported the introduction of the Liberals&#x27; 1907 Irish Council Bill, which was also supported by O&#x27;Brien and IPP members who initially voted for the first reading. Redmond said, &quot;if this measure fulfilled certain conditions I laid down we should consider it an aid to Home Rule&quot;. When this was rejected by Dillon and the UIL, Redmond, fearing another Party split, quietly endured Dillon&#x27;s dictate of distancing the Irish Party from any understanding with the landlord class.


The first election of January 1910 changed everything to Redmond&#x27;s advantage, returning a hung parliament in which his parliamentary party held the balance of power at Westminster; this marked a high point in his political career. The previous year, the Lords had blocked the budget of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George. Redmond&#x27;s party supported the Liberals in introducing a bill to curb the power of the House of Lords, which, after a second election in December 1910 had generated an almost identical result to the one in January, became the Parliament Act 1911. Irish Home Rule (which the Lords had blocked in 1893) now became a realistic possibility. Redmond used his leverage to persuade the Liberal government of H. H. Asquith to introduce the Third Home Rule Bill in April 1912, to grant Ireland national self-government. The Lords no longer had the power to block such a bill, only to delay its enactment for two years. Home Rule had reached the pinnacle of its success and Redmond had gone much further than any of his predecessors in shaping British politics to the needs of the Irish.

Redmond was an opponent of votes for women and had abstained on votes regarding the topic. On 1 April 1912 he informed a delegation of the Irish Women&#x27;s Franchise League that he would not support giving women the vote if home rule was granted. Redmond&#x27;s opposition to female suffrage drew the ire of the suffragettes leading to the defacing of a statue of Redmond in 1913 by a suffragette protestor.

For all its reservations, the Home Rule Bill was for Redmond the fulfilment of a lifelong dream. &quot;If I may say so reverently&quot;, he told the House of Commons, &quot;I personally thank God that I have lived to see this day&quot;. But Asquith did not incorporate into the bill any significant concessions to Ulster Unionists, who then campaigned relentlessly against it. Nonetheless, by 1914 Redmond had become a nationalist hero of Parnellite stature and could have had every expectation of becoming head of a new Irish government in Dublin.

==Home rule passed==

But like most leaders in the nationalist scene, not least his successors in the republican scene, he knew little of Ulster or the intensity of Unionist sentiment against home rule. His successor, John Dillon, claimed that Redmond had removed all the obstacles to Irish unity except those of the Ulster unionists. He had persuaded British public and political opinion of all hues of its merits. William O&#x27;Brien and his dissident All-for-Ireland League warned in similar vein, that the volatile Northern Ireland situation was left unresolved.

Home rule was vehemently opposed by many Irish Protestants, the Irish Unionist Party and Ulster&#x27;s Orange Order, who feared domination in an overwhelmingly Catholic state. Unionists also feared economic problems, namely that the predominantly agricultural Ireland would impose tariffs on British goods, leading to restrictions on the importation of industrial produce; the main location of Ireland&#x27;s industrial development was Ulster, the north-east of the island, the only part of Ireland dominated by unionists. Most unionist leaders, especially Sir Edward Carson—with whom Redmond always had a good personal relationship, based on shared experiences at Trinity College Dublin and the Irish bar—threatened the use of force to prevent home rule, helped by their supporters in the British Conservative Party. Redmond misjudged them as merely bluffing. Carson predicted that if any attempt to coerce any part of Ulster were made, &quot;a united Ireland within the lifetime of anyone now living would be out of the question&quot;.

During negotiations early in 1914, two lines of concessions for the Carsonites were formulated: autonomy for Ulster in the form of &#x27;Home Rule within Home Rule&#x27;, which Redmond was inclined to, or alternatively the Lloyd George scheme of three years as the time limit for temporary exclusion. Redmond grudgingly acquiesced to this as &quot;the price of peace&quot;. From the moment Carson spurned &#x27;temporary&#x27; exclusion, the country began a plunge into anarchy. The situation took on an entirely new aspect in late March with the Curragh Mutiny together with the spectre of civil war on the part of the Ulster Covenanters, who formed the Ulster Volunteers to oppose Home Rule, forcing Redmond to then in July take over control of their counterpart, the Irish Volunteers, established in November 1913 to enforce Home Rule.

Asquith conceded to the Lords&#x27; demand to have the Government of Ireland Act 1914, which had passed all stages in the Commons, amended to temporarily exclude the six counties of Northern Ireland, which for a period would continue to be governed by London, not Dublin, and to later make some special provision for them. A Buckingham Palace Conference failed to resolve the entangled situation. Strongly opposed to the partition of Ireland in any form, Redmond and his party reluctantly agreed to what they understood would be a &quot;trial&quot; exclusion of now six years; under Redmond&#x27;s aspiration that &quot;Ulster will have to follow&quot;, he was belatedly prepared to concede a large measure of autonomy to it to come in.

Redmond&#x27;s confidence was strong and communicated itself to Ireland. But whatever could be said to shake confidence was said by William O&#x27;Brien and Tim Healy, who denounced the Bill as worthless when linked to the plan of even temporary partition and declared that, whatever the Government might say at present, &quot;we had not yet reached the end of their concessions&quot;. On the division, they and their All-for-Ireland League abstained, so that the majority dropped from 85 to 77. Using the Parliament Act, the Lords was deemed to have passed the Act; it received the Royal Assent in September 1914.

==European conflict intervenes==
On the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Home Rule Act was suspended for the duration of the conflict. Judged from the perspective of that time, Redmond had won a form of triumph: he had secured the passing of Home Rule with the provision that the implementation of the measure would be delayed &quot;not later than the end of the present war&quot;, which &quot;would be bloody but short-lived&quot;. His Unionist opponents were confused and dismayed by the passing of the Home Rule Act and by the absence of any definite provisions for the exclusion of Ulster. In two speeches delivered by Redmond in August and September 1914, deemed as critical turning points in the Home Rule process, he stated: &quot;Armed Nationalist Catholics in the South will be only too glad to join arms with the armed Protestant Ulstermen in the North. Is it too much to hope that out of this situation there may spring a result which will be good, not merely for the Empire, but good for the future welfare and integrity of the Irish nation?&quot;

Under these circumstances, any political bargaining might well have been disastrous to Home Rule. Redmond desperately wanted and needed a rapid enactment of the Home Rule Act, and undoubtedly his words were a means to that end. He called on the country to support the Allied and British war effort and Britain&#x27;s commitment under the Triple Entente; this was a calculated response to the situation principally in the belief that the attained measure of self-government would be granted in full after the war and to be in a stronger position to stave off a final partition of Northern Ireland. His added hope was that the common sacrifice by Irish nationalists and Unionists would bring them closer together, but above all that nationalists could not afford to allow Ulster Unionists to reap the benefit of being the only Irish to support the war effort, when they spontaneously enlisted in their 36th (Ulster) Division. He said Let Irishmen come together in the trenches and risk their lives together and spill their blood together, and I say there is no power on earth that when they come home can induce them to turn as enemies upon one another.

Redmond also argued that &quot;No people can be said to have rightly proved their nationhood and their power to maintain it until they have demonstrated their military prowess&quot;. He praised Irish soldiers, &quot;with their astonishing courage and their beautiful faith, with their natural military genius […] offering up their supreme sacrifice of life with a smile on their lips because it was given for Ireland&quot;.

Speaking at Maryborough on 16 August 1914, he addressed a 2,000-strong assembly of Irish Volunteers, some armed, saying he had told the British Parliament that:
for the first time in the history of the connection between England and Ireland, it was safe to-day for England to withdraw her armed troops from our country and that the sons of Ireland themselves, North and South, Catholic and Protestant, and whatever the origin of their race might have been – Williamite, Cromwellian, or old Celtic – standing shoulder to shoulder, would defend the good order and peace of Ireland, and defend her shores against any foreign foe.

==Nationalists split==
Redmond&#x27;s appeal, however, to the Irish Volunteers to also enlist caused them to split; a large majority of 140,000 followed Redmond and formed the National Volunteers, who enthusiastically enlisted in Irish regiments of the 10th and 16th (Irish) Divisions of the New British Army, while a minority of around 9,700 members remained as the original Irish Volunteers. Redmond believed that the German Empire&#x27;s hegemony and military expansion threatened the freedom of Europe and that it was Ireland&#x27;s duty, having achieved future self-government:
&quot;to the best of her ability to go where ever the firing line extends, in defence of right, of freedom and of religion in this war. It would be a disgrace forever to our country otherwise&quot;. (Woodenbridge speech to the Irish Volunteers, 20 September 1914)

Redmond requested the War Office to allow the formation of a separate Irish Brigade as had been done for the Ulster Volunteers, but Britain was suspicious of Redmond. His plan was that post-war the Irish Brigade and National Volunteers would provide the basis for an Irish Army, capable of enforcing Home Rule on reluctant Ulster Unionists. Eventually he was granted the gesture of the 16th (Irish) Division which, with the exception of its Irish General William Hickie at first had mostly English officers, unlike the Ulster Division which had its own reserve militia officers, since most of the experienced officers in Ireland had already been posted to the 10th (Irish) Division and most Irish recruits enlisting in the new army lacked the military training to act as officers. Redmond&#x27;s own son, William Redmond, enlisted, as did his own brother Major Willie Redmond MP, despite being aged over 50 years. They belonged to a group of five Irish MPs who enlisted, the others J. L. Esmonde, Stephen Gwynn, and D. D. Sheehan as well as former MP Tom Kettle.

Redmond was and is still criticised for having encouraged so many Irish to fight in the Great War. However the Irish historian J. J. Lee wrote: &quot;Redmond could have tactically done nothing other than support the British war campaign; . . . nobody committed to Irish unity could have behaved other than Redmond did at the time. Otherwise, there would be no chance whatever of a united Ireland, in which Redmond passionately believed&quot;. 

==Easter Rising and aftermath==
During 1915 Redmond felt secure in his course and that the path was already partly cleared for Home Rule to be achieved without bloodshed. He was supported by continued by-election successes of the IPP, and felt strong enough to turn down the offer of a cabinet seat, which would have offset Carson&#x27;s appointment to the cabinet but would have been unpopular in Ireland. Even in 1916, he felt supremely confident and optimistic despite timely warnings from Bonar Law of an impending insurrection. Redmond did not expect the 1916 Easter Rising, which was staged by the remaining Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, led by a number of influential republicans, under Patrick Pearse. Pearse, who had in 1913 stood with Redmond on the same platform where the Rising now took place, had at that time praised Redmond&#x27;s efforts in achieving the promise of Home Rule. Redmond later acknowledged that the Rising was a shattering blow to his lifelong policy of constitutional action. It equally helped fuel republican sentiment, particularly when General Maxwell executed the leaders of the Rising, treating them as traitors in wartime.

On 3 May 1916, after three of the Rising&#x27;s leaders had been executed—Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh and Tom Clarke—Redmond said in the House of Commons: &quot;This outbreak, happily, seems to be over. It has been dealt with firmness, which was not only right, but it was the duty of the Government to so deal with it&quot;. However, he urged the Government &quot;not to show undue hardship or severity to the great masses of those who are implicated [in the Rising]&quot;. Redmond&#x27;s plea, and John Dillon&#x27;s, that the rebels be treated leniently were ignored.

There followed Asquith&#x27;s attempt to introduce Home Rule in July 1916. David Lloyd George, recently appointed Secretary of State for War, was sent to Dublin to offer this to the leaders of the Irish Party, Redmond and Dillon. The scheme revolved around partition, officially a temporary arrangement, as understood by Redmond. Lloyd George, however, gave the Ulster leader Carson a written guarantee that Ulster would not be forced in. His tactic was to see that neither side would find out before a compromise was implemented. A modified Act of 1914 had been drawn up by the Cabinet on 17 June. The Act had two amendments enforced by Unionists on 19 July: permanent exclusion of Ulster, and a reduction of Ireland&#x27;s representation in the Commons. Lloyd George informed Redmond of this on 22 July 1916, and Redmond accused the government of treachery. This was decisive to the future fortunes of the Home Rule movement; the Lloyd George debacle of 22 July finished the constitutional party, overthrew Redmond&#x27;s power and left him utterly demoralised. It simultaneously discredited the politics of consent and created the space for radical alternatives. Redmond, after 1916 was increasingly eclipsed by ill-health, the rise of Sinn Féin and the growing dominance of Dillon within the Irish Party.

June 1917 brought a severe personal blow to Redmond when his brother Willie died in action on the front at the onset of the Battle of Messines offensive in Flanders; his vacant seat in East Clare was then won in July by Éamon de Valera, the most senior surviving commandant of the Easter insurgents. It was one of three by-election gains by Sinn Féin, the small separatist party that had played no part in the Rising, but was wrongly blamed by Britain and the Irish media. It was then taken over by surviving Rising leaders, under de Valera and the IRB. Just at this time, Redmond made a desperate effort to broker a new compromise with Irish unionists, when he accepted Lloyd George&#x27;s proposal for a national convention to resolve the problem of Home Rule and draft a constitution for Ireland.

== Defeat and death ==
An Irish Convention of around one hundred delegates sat from July and ended in March 1918. Up until December 1917, Redmond used his influence to have a plan which had been put forward by the Southern Unionist leader Lord Midleton, accepted. It foresaw All-Ireland Home Rule with partial fiscal autonomy (until after the war, without customs and excise). All sides, including most Ulster delegates, wavered towards favouring agreement. Already ailing while attending the convention, his health permanently affected by an accident in 1912, Redmond also suffered assault on the street in Dublin by a crowd of young Sinn Féin supporters on his way to the convention, which included Todd Andrews. On 15 January, just when he intended to move a motion on his proposal to have the Midleton plan agreed, some nationalist colleagues—the prominent Catholic Bishop O&#x27;Donnell and MP Joseph Devlin—expressed doubts. Rather than split the nationalist side, he withdrew his motion. A vital chance was lost.

He ended his participation by saying that under the circumstances he felt he could be of no further use to the Convention in the matter. His final word in the convention was the tragic one – &quot;Better for us never to have met than to have met and failed.&quot; Late in February the malady from which he was suffering grew worse. He left Dublin for London knowing that a settlement from the convention was impossible. An operation in March 1918 to remove an intestinal obstruction appeared to progress well at first, but then he suffered heart failure. He died a few hours later at a London nursing home on 6 March 1918. One of the last things he said to the Jesuit Father who was with him to the end, was, &quot;Father, I am a broken-hearted man&quot;. At the convention, his last move was an adoption of O’Brien&#x27;s policy of accommodating Unionist opposition in the North and in the South. It was too late. Had he joined O’Brien ten years before and carried the Irish Party with him, it is possible that Ireland&#x27;s destiny would have been settled by evolution.

Condolences and expressions of sympathy were widely expressed. After a funeral service in Westminster Cathedral his remains were interred, as requested in a manner characteristic of the man, in the family vault at the old Knight Hospitallers churchyard of Saint John&#x27;s Cemetery, Wexford town, amongst his own people rather than in the traditional burial place for Irish statesmen and heroes in Glasnevin Cemetery. The small, neglected cemetery near the town centre is kept locked to the public – his vault, which had been in a dilapidated state, has been only partially restored by Wexford County Council.

==Party&#x27;s demise==
Redmond was succeeded in the party leadership by John Dillon and spared the experience of further political setbacks when after the German spring offensive of April 1918, Britain, caught in a desperate war of attrition, attempted to introduce conscription in Ireland linked with implementation of Home Rule. The Irish Nationalists led by Dillon walked out of the House of Commons and returned to Ireland to join in the widespread resistance and protests during the resulting conscription crisis.

The crisis boosted Sinn Féin so that in the December general election it won the vast majority of seats, leaving the Nationalist Party with only six seats for the 220,837 votes cast (21.7%) (down from 84 seats out of 103 in 1910). The party did not win a proportionate share of seats because the election was not run under a proportional representation system, but on the &#x27;first past the post&#x27; British electoral system. Unionists, on the other hand, won 26 seats for 287,618 (28.3%) of votes, whereas Sinn Féin votes were 476,087 (or 46.9%) for 48 seats, plus 25 uncontested, totalling 73 seats. In January 1919 a Unilateral Declaration of Independence by the First Dáil attended by twenty-seven Sinn Féin members (others were in jail or unable to attend) proclaimed an Irish Republic. The subsequent parliament of the Second Dail was superseded by the establishment of the Irish Free State. The Irish Civil War followed.

Home Rule was finally implemented in 1921 under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 which introduced two Home Rule parliaments, although only adopted by the six counties forming Northern Ireland.

==Legacy and personal vision==
John Redmond&#x27;s home town of Wexford remained a strongly Redmondite area for decades afterwards. The seat of Waterford city was one of the few outside Ulster not to be won by Sinn Féin in the 1918 general election. Redmond&#x27;s son William Redmond represented the city until his death in 1932. A later Irish Taoiseach (prime minister), John Bruton, hung a painting of Redmond, whom he regarded as his hero because of his perceived commitment to non-violence in Ireland, in his office in Ireland&#x27;s Leinster House Government Buildings. However, his successor Bertie Ahern replaced the painting with one of Patrick Pearse.
Redmond&#x27;s personal vision did not encompass a wholly independent Ireland. He referred to:
&quot;that brighter day when the grant of full self-government would reveal to Britain the open secret of making Ireland her friend and helpmate, the brightest jewel in her crown of Empire&quot;.

He had above all a conciliatory agenda; in his final words in parliament he expressed &quot;a plea for concord between the two races that providence has designed should work as neighbours together&quot;. For him, Home Rule was an interim step for All-Ireland autonomy:
&quot;His reward was to be repudiated and denounced by a generation which had yet to learn, as they learned three years later when they were forced to accept Partition, that true freedom is rarely served by bloodshed and violence, and that in politics compromise is inevitable. Yet it can be said of John Redmond that none of Ireland&#x27;s sons had ever served her with greater sincerity or nobler purpose&quot;.

<doc id="204464" wikidata="Q911916" url="?curid=204464" title="Intensive and extensive properties">
<text>Physical or chemical properties of materials and systems can often be categorized as being either intensive or extensive, according to how the property changes when the size (or extent) of the system changes.
The terms &quot;intensive and extensive quantities&quot; were introduced into physics by German mathematician Georg Helm in 1898, and by American physicist and chemist Richard C. Tolman in 1917.

According to International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), an intensive property or intensive quantity is one whose magnitude is independent of the size of the system.
An intensive property is not necessarily homogeneously distributed in space; it can vary from place to place in a body of matter and radiation. Examples of intensive properties include temperature, &quot;T&quot;; refractive index, &quot;n&quot;; density, &quot;ρ&quot;; and hardness, &quot;η&quot;.

By contrast, an extensive property or extensive quantity is one whose magnitude is additive for subsystems.
Examples include mass, volume and Gibbs energy.

Not all properties of matter fall into these two categories. For example, the square root of the volume is neither intensive nor extensive. If a system is doubled in size by juxtaposing a second identical system, the value of an intensive property equals the value for each subsystem and the value of an extensive property is twice the value for each subsystem. However the property √V is instead multiplied by √2 .

The distinction between intensive and extensive properties has some theoretical uses. For example, in thermodynamics, the state of a simple compressible system is completely specified by two independent, intensive properties, along with one extensive property, such as mass. Other intensive properties are derived from those two intensive variables.

==Intensive properties==
An intensive property is a physical quantity whose value does not depend on the amount of substance which was measured. The most obvious intensive quantities are ratios of extensive quantities. In a homogeneous system divided into two halves, all its extensive properties, in particular its volume and its mass, are divided into two halves. All its intensive properties, such as the mass per volume (mass density) or volume per mass (specific volume), must remain the same in each half.

The temperature of a system in thermal equilibrium is the same as the temperature of any part of it, so temperature is an intensive quantity. If the system is divided by a wall that is permeable to heat or to matter, the temperature of each subsystem is identical. Additionally, the boiling temperature of a substance is an intensive property. For example, the boiling temperature of water is 100 °C at a pressure of one atmosphere, regardless of the quantity of water remaining as liquid.

===Examples===
Examples of intensive properties include:

* charge density, &quot;ρ&quot; (or &quot;ne&quot;)
* chemical potential, &quot;μ&quot;
* color
* concentration, &quot;c&quot;
* energy density, &quot;ρ&quot;
* magnetic permeability, &quot;μ&quot;
* mass density, &quot;ρ&quot; (or specific gravity)
* melting point and boiling point
* molality, &quot;m&quot; or &quot;b&quot;
* pressure, &quot;p&quot;
* refractive index
* specific conductance (or electrical conductivity)
* specific heat capacity, &quot;cp&quot;
* specific internal energy, &quot;u&quot;
* specific rotation, [&quot;α&quot;]
* specific volume, &quot;v&quot;
* standard reduction potential, &quot;E°&quot;
* surface tension
* temperature, &quot;T&quot;
* thermal conductivity
* velocity &quot;v&quot;
* viscosity
See List of materials properties for a more exhaustive list specifically pertaining to materials.

==Extensive properties==
An extensive property is a physical quantity whose value is proportional to the size of the system it describes, or to the quantity of matter in the system. For example, the mass of a sample is an extensive quantity; it depends on the amount of substance. The related intensive quantity is the density which is independent of the amount. The density of water is approximately 1g/mL whether you consider a drop of water or a swimming pool, but the mass is different in the two cases.

Dividing one extensive property by another extensive property gives an intensive property—for example: mass (extensive) divided by volume (extensive) gives density (intensive).

Any extensive quantity E for a sample can be divided by the sample&#x27;s volume, to become the &quot;E density&quot; for the sample;
similarly, any extensive quantity &quot;E&quot; can be divided by the sample&#x27;s mass, to become the sample&#x27;s &quot;specific E&quot;;
extensive quantities &quot;E&quot; which have been divided by the number of moles in their sample are referred to as &quot;molar E&quot;.

=== Examples ===
Examples of extensive properties include:

* amount of substance, &quot;n&quot;
* enthalpy, &quot;H&quot;
* entropy, &quot;S&quot;
* Gibbs energy, &quot;G&quot;
* heat capacity, &quot;Cp&quot;
* Helmholtz energy, &quot;A&quot; or &quot;F&quot;
* internal energy, &quot;U&quot;
* spring stiffness, &quot;K&quot;
* mass, &quot;m&quot;
* volume, &quot;V&quot;
==Conjugate quantities==
In thermodynamics, some extensive quantities measure amounts that are conserved in a thermodynamic process of transfer. They are transferred across a wall between two thermodynamic systems or subsystems. For example, species of matter may be transferred through a semipermeable membrane. Likewise, volume may be thought of as transferred in a process in which there is a motion of the wall between two systems, increasing the volume of one and decreasing that of the other by equal amounts.

On the other hand, some extensive quantities measure amounts that are not conserved in a thermodynamic process of transfer between a system and its surroundings. In a thermodynamic process in which a quantity of energy is transferred from the surroundings into or out of a system as heat, a corresponding quantity of entropy in the system respectively increases or decreases, but, in general, not in the same amount as in the surroundings. Likewise, a change in the amount of electric polarization in a system is not necessarily matched by a corresponding change in electric polarization in the surroundings.

In a thermodynamic system, transfers of extensive quantities are associated with changes in respective specific intensive quantities. For example, a volume transfer is associated with a change in pressure. An entropy change is associated with a temperature change. A change in the amount of electric polarization is associated with an electric field change. The transferred extensive quantities and their associated respective intensive quantities have dimensions that multiply to give the dimensions of energy. The two members of such respective specific pairs are mutually conjugate. Either one, but not both, of a conjugate pair may be set up as an independent state variable of a thermodynamic system. Conjugate setups are associated by Legendre transformations.

==Composite properties==
The ratio of two extensive properties of the same object or system is an intensive property. For example, the ratio of an object&#x27;s mass and volume, which are two extensive properties, is density, which is an intensive property.

More generally properties can be combined to give new properties, which may be called derived or composite properties. For example, the base quantities mass and volume can be combined to give the derived quantity density. These composite properties can sometimes also be classified as intensive or extensive. Suppose a composite property formula_1 is a function of a set of intensive properties formula_2 and a set of extensive properties formula_3, which can be shown as formula_4. If the size of the system is changed by some scaling factor, formula_5, only the extensive properties will change, since intensive properties are independent of the size of the system. The scaled system, then, can be represented as formula_6.

Intensive properties are independent of the size of the system, so the property F is an intensive property if for all values of the scaling factor, formula_5,

:formula_8

(This is equivalent to saying that intensive composite properties are homogeneous functions of degree 0 with respect to formula_3.)

It follows, for example, that the ratio of two extensive properties is an intensive property. To illustrate, consider a system having a certain mass, formula_10, and volume, formula_11. The density, formula_12 is equal to mass (extensive) divided by volume (extensive): formula_13. If the system is scaled by the factor formula_5, then the mass and volume become formula_15 and formula_16, and the density becomes formula_17; the two formula_5s cancel, so this could be written mathematically as formula_19, which is analogous to the equation for formula_1 above.

The property formula_1 is an extensive property if for all formula_5,

:formula_23

(This is equivalent to saying that extensive composite properties are homogeneous functions of degree 1 with respect to formula_3.) It follows from Euler&#x27;s homogeneous function theorem that

:formula_25

where the partial derivative is taken with all parameters constant except formula_26. This last equation can be used to derive thermodynamic relations.

=== Specific properties===
A &quot;specific&quot; property is the intensive property obtained by dividing an extensive property of a system by its mass. For example, heat capacity is an extensive property of a system. Dividing heat capacity, formula_27, by the mass of the system gives the specific heat capacity, formula_28, which is an intensive property. When the extensive property is represented by an upper-case letter, the symbol for the corresponding intensive property is usually represented by a lower-case letter. Common examples are given in the table below.

===Molar properties===
If the amount of substance in moles can be determined, then each of these thermodynamic properties may be expressed on a molar basis, and their name may be qualified with the adjective &quot; molar&quot;, yielding terms such as molar volume, molar internal energy, molar enthalpy, and molar entropy. The symbol for molar quantities may be indicated by adding a subscript &quot;m&quot; to the corresponding extensive property. For example, molar enthalpy is formula_29. Molar Gibbs free energy is commonly referred to as chemical potential, symbolized by formula_30, particularly when discussing a partial molar Gibbs free energy formula_31 for a component formula_32 in a mixture.

For the characterization of substances or reactions, tables usually report the molar properties referred to a standard state. In that case a superscript formula_33 is added to the symbol. Examples:
* formula_34 = is the molar volume of an ideal gas at standard conditions for temperature and pressure (being and ).
* formula_35 is the standard molar heat capacity of a substance at constant pressure.
* formula_36 is the standard enthalpy variation of a reaction (with subcases: formation enthalpy, combustion enthalpy...).
* formula_37 is the standard reduction potential of a redox couple, i.e. Gibbs energy over charge, which is measured in volt = J/C.

==Limitations==

The general validity of the division of physical properties into extensive and intensive kinds has been addressed in the course of science. Redlich noted that, although physical properties and especially thermodynamic properties are most conveniently defined as either intensive or extensive, these two categories are not all-inclusive and some well-defined concepts like the square-root of a volume conform to neither definition.

Other systems, for which standard definitions do not provide a simple answer, are systems in which the subsystems interact when combined. Redlich pointed out that the assignment of some properties as intensive or extensive may depend on the way subsystems are arranged. For example, if two identical galvanic cells are connected in parallel, the voltage of the system is equal to the voltage of each cell, while the electric charge transferred (or the electric current) is extensive. However, if the same cells are connected in series, the charge becomes intensive and the voltage extensive. The IUPAC definitions do not consider such cases.

Some intensive properties do not apply at very small sizes. For example, viscosity is a macroscopic quantity and is not relevant for extremely small systems. Likewise, at a very small scale color is not independent of size, as shown by quantum dots, whose color depends on the size of the &quot;dot&quot;.

<doc id="204466" wikidata="Q192970" url="?curid=204466" title="Bubble chamber">
<text>A bubble chamber is a vessel filled with a superheated transparent liquid (most often liquid hydrogen) used to detect electrically charged particles moving through it. It was invented in 1952 by Donald A. Glaser, for which he was awarded the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physics. Supposedly, Glaser was inspired by the bubbles in a glass of beer; however, in a 2006 talk, he refuted this story, although saying that while beer was not the inspiration for the bubble chamber, he did experiments using beer to fill early prototypes.

While bubble chambers were extensively used in the past, they have now mostly been supplanted by wire chambers, spark chambers, drift chambers, and silicon detectors. Notable bubble chambers include the Big European Bubble Chamber (BEBC) and Gargamelle.

==Function and use==
The bubble chamber is similar to a cloud chamber, both in application and in basic principle. It is normally made by filling a large cylinder with a liquid heated to just below its boiling point. As particles enter the chamber, a piston suddenly decreases its pressure, and the liquid enters into a superheated, metastable phase. Charged particles create an ionization track, around which the liquid vaporizes, forming microscopic bubbles. Bubble density around a track is proportional to a particle&#x27;s energy loss.

Bubbles grow in size as the chamber expands, until they are large enough to be seen or photographed. Several cameras are mounted around it, allowing a three-dimensional image of an event to be captured. Bubble chambers with resolutions down to a few micrometers (μm) have been operated.

It is often useful to subject the entire chamber to a constant magnetic field. It acts on charged particles through Lorentz force and causes them to travel in helical paths whose radii are determined by the particles&#x27; charge-to-mass ratios and their velocities. Because the magnitude of the charge of all known, charged, long-lived subatomic particles is the same as that of an electron, their radius of curvature must be proportional to their momentum. Thus, by measuring a particle&#x27;s radius of curvature, its momentum can be determined.

=== Notable discoveries ===
Notable discoveries made by bubble chamber include the discovery of weak neutral currents at Gargamelle in 1973, which established the soundness of the electroweak theory and led to the discovery of the W and Z bosons in 1983 (at the UA1 and UA2 experiments). Recently, bubble chambers have been used in research on weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP)s, at SIMPLE, COUPP, PICASSO and more recently, PICO.

==Drawbacks==
Although bubble chambers were very successful in the past, they are of limited use in modern very-high-energy experiments for a variety of reasons:

* The need for a photographic readout rather than three-dimensional electronic data makes it less convenient, especially in experiments which must be reset, repeated and analyzed many times.
* The superheated phase must be ready at the precise moment of collision, which complicates the detection of short-lived particles. 
* Bubble chambers are neither large nor massive enough to analyze high-energy collisions, where all products should be contained inside the detector. 
* The high-energy particles may have path radii too large to be accurately measured in a relatively small chamber, thereby hindering precise estimation of momentum.

Due to these issues, bubble chambers have largely been replaced by wire chambers, which allow particle energies to be measured at the same time. Another alternative technique is the spark chamber.

== Examples ==
* 30 cm Bubble Chamber (CERN)
* 81 cm Saclay Bubble Chamber
* 2 m Bubble Chamber (CERN)
* Berne Infinitesimal Bubble Chamber
* Bevatron, a particle accelerator with a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber
* Big European Bubble Chamber
* Holographic Lexan Bubble Chamber
* Gargamelle, a heavy liquid bubble chamber which operated in CERN between 1970 and 1979.
* LExan Bubble Chamber
* PICO, liquid freon bubble chamber searching for dark matter

<text>Kimila Ann Basinger ( ; born December 8, 1953) is an American actress. She has garnered acclaim for her work in film, for which she has received various accolades including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Initially a TV starlet, she shot to fame as a Bond girl in 1983 and enjoyed a long heyday over the next two decades. In 2011 &quot;Los Angeles Times Magazine&quot; ranked her third on the &quot;50 Most Beautiful Women In Film&quot;.

Basinger began her career as a model and switched to acting in 1976. She appeared in several television productions, including a remake of &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1979), before making her feature debut in the rural drama &quot;Hard Country&quot; (1981). Basinger first gained widespread attention for her performance of Domino Petachi in the James Bond entry &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983). She went on to receive a Golden Globe nomination for her role in &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984), starred in the erotic drama &quot;9½ Weeks&quot; (1986), and played Vicki Vale in Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; (1989), which remains the highest-grossing film of her career. For her femme fatale portrayal in &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1997), Basinger won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Her other films include &quot;No Mercy&quot; (1986), &quot;Blind Date&quot; (1987), &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot; (1988), &quot;Cool World&quot; (1992), &quot;The Real McCoy&quot; (1993), &quot;I Dreamed of Africa&quot; (2000), &quot;8 Mile&quot; (2002), &quot;The Door in the Floor&quot; (2004), &quot;Cellular&quot; (2004), &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (2006), &quot;The Burning Plain&quot; (2009), &quot;Grudge Match&quot; (2013), and &quot;Fifty Shades Darker&quot; (2017). Basinger&#x27;s portrayal of Elena Lincoln in the lattermost earned her a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress after five previous nominations.

Divorced from makeup artist Ron Snyder and actor Alec Baldwin, Basinger cohabitates with her longtime hairdresser, Mitch Stone. She had a high-profile relationship between marriages with musician Prince, with whom she recorded an album, &quot;Hollywood Affair&quot;, and is the mother of social media influencer Ireland Baldwin from her marriage to Baldwin.

==Early life and modeling==

Basinger was born in Athens, Georgia, on December 8, 1953. Her mother, Ann Lee (née Cordell; 1925–2017), was a model, actress and swimmer who appeared in several Esther Williams films. Her father, Donald Wade Basinger (1923–2016), was a big band musician and loan manager; as a U.S. Army soldier, he landed in Normandy on D-Day. The middle of five children, she has two older brothers, Skip (b. 1950) and Mick (b. 1951), and two younger sisters, Barbara (b. 1956) and Ashley (b. 1959). Basinger&#x27;s ancestry includes English, German, and Ulster Scots. She was raised a Methodist. Basinger has described herself as extremely shy, which had a major effect on her during her childhood and young adulthood. She has said that her shyness was so extreme that she would faint if asked to speak in class.

Basinger studied ballet from about age three to her mid-teens. By her mid-teens, she grew in confidence and successfully auditioned for the school cheerleading team. At 17, she entered America&#x27;s Junior Miss Scholarship Pageant, won at the city level and was crowned Athens Junior Miss. While she didn&#x27;t win at the state level, her beauty was profiled in the national program. She had competed at the state level for the Breck Scholarship and was featured in an ad for Breck in a joint portrait with her mother.

Basinger was offered a modeling contract with the Ford Modeling Agency, but turned it down in favor of singing and acting, and enrolled at the University of Georgia. She soon reconsidered and went to New York to become a Ford model. Despite earning US$1,000 a day, Basinger never enjoyed modeling, saying: &quot;It was very hard to go from one booking to another and always have to deal with the way I looked. I couldn&#x27;t stand it. I felt myself choking.&quot; Basinger has said that even as a model, when others relished looking in the mirror before appearing, she abhorred it and would avoid mirrors out of insecurity. Not long after her Ford deal, Basinger appeared on the cover of magazines. She also appears on the cover of the debut album by the band Survivor. She appeared in hundreds of advertisements throughout the early 1970s, most notably as the Breck Shampoo girl. She alternated between modeling and attending acting classes at the Neighborhood Playhouse, as well as performing in Greenwich Village clubs as a singer. Basinger is an alumna of the William Esper Studio for the performing arts in Manhattan, New York City.

==Career==
===Early roles (1976–1982)===
In 1976, after four years as a cover girl, Basinger quit modeling and moved to Los Angeles to act. She made guest appearances on a few television shows such as &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, turning down a regular role in the latter series that eventually went to Cheryl Ladd. Her first starring role was a made-for-TV movie, &quot;&quot; (1978), in which she played a small town girl who goes to Hollywood to become an actress and winds up becoming a famous centerfold for a men&#x27;s magazine. In 1979, she co-starred with Natalie Wood, William Devane and Steve Railsback in the miniseries remake of &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, reprising her role as prostitute Lorene Rogers in a 13-episode spinoff that aired in 1980. In 1981, Basinger posed for a famous nude pictorial for &quot;Playboy&quot;, and made her feature debut in the critically well-received but little-seen rural drama &quot;Hard Country&quot;, which she followed with the Charlton Heston-directed outdoorsy adventure &quot;Mother Lode&quot; (1982).

===Worldwide exposure (1983–1989)===
Her 1981 &quot;Playboy&quot; shoot was not published until 1983, when Basinger used it to promote her breakthrough role as the Bond girl Domino Petachi in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983), where she starred opposite Sean Connery. In his review of the film, Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said Basinger &quot;looks like a voluptuous sibling of Liv Ullmann and has a certain something.&quot; Worldwide, &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; grossed US$160 million. Basinger said her subsequent &quot;Playboy&quot; appearance led to further opportunities, such as the role of the romantic interest of a baseball team star in Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984), alongside Robert Redford, for which she earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

Blake Edwards cast her twice in his films; as a beautiful woman married to a Texas millionaire in &quot;The Man Who Loved Women&quot; (1983), and as an apparently shy woman who goes on a date with a workaholic man in &quot;Blind Date&quot; (1987). Robert Altman cast Basinger in the role of a woman hiding from her former lover at an old motel in &quot;Fool for Love&quot; (1985). In 1986, Basinger starred as a New York City art gallery employee who has a brief yet intense affair with a mysterious Wall Street broker, opposite Mickey Rourke, in Adrian Lyne&#x27;s controversial erotic romantic drama &quot;9½ Weeks&quot;. Though the film failed at the North American box office, it performed very well in Europe, especially France, and acquired a large American fanbase on home video and cable. Roger Ebert praised the film, comparing it to &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, and said Basinger helped &quot;develop an erotic tension [...] that is convincing, complicated and sensual.&quot;

Academy Award-winning writer-director Robert Benton also cast her in the title role of a slightly pregnant woman in trouble for &quot;Nadine&quot; (1987). While most of the films Basinger starred in during this period were released to varying degrees of success, they helped to establish her as an actress. With over US$400 million in box office totals, the highest-grossing film of her career thus far is Tim Burton&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;Batman&quot;, in which Basinger took on role of photojournalist Vicki Vale, opposite Michael Keaton (Batman) and Jack Nicholson (Joker). Basinger re-wrote the film&#x27;s third act with producer Jon Peters with whom she was having a behind the scenes affair. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, in its original review, remarked that &quot;the uniqueness and very soul of the film [...] is achieved through the beautifully defined and probing performances of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne and Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale&quot;.

===1990s===
Following the success of &quot;Batman&quot;, Basinger played a glamorous singer, alongside Alec Baldwin, in the comedy &quot;The Marrying Man&quot; (1991), and starred with Richard Gere, as a woman romantically involved with her sister&#x27;s psychiatrist, in the neo-noir &quot;Final Analysis&quot; (1992). Both films were released to moderate box office returns. In 1992, Basinger was also a guest vocalist on a re-recorded version of Was (Not Was)&#x27;s &quot;Shake Your Head&quot;, which featured Ozzy Osbourne on vocals, and reached the UK Top 5, and starred in what marked her only voice-acting project to date, the film &quot;Cool World&quot;, directed by Ralph Bakshi, as a cartoon bombshell who longs to become a real human woman.

In 1993, Basinger took on the roles of a woman recently released from prison in the crime film &quot;The Real McCoy&quot;, and that of a woman named Honey Hornée in the comedy &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;. In 1994, she reunited professionally with Baldwin for the thriller &quot;The Getaway&quot;, in which she portrayed the wife of a former con, and with director Robert Altman for the comedy &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot;, playing a breathlessly dim-witted cable reporter. Amid financial issues, Basinger went into hiatus from the screen by the mid-1990s.

She made a comeback as the high-class hooker in Curtis Hanson&#x27;s neo-noir &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1997), alongside Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe. She initially turned down the film twice, feeling an insecurity at returning to the screen and enjoying motherhood. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt that Basinger &quot;exudes a sort of chaste sultriness&quot;, in what Roger Ebert described as &quot;one of the best films of the year&quot;. The role earned her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role, and was also nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. She holds the distinction of being the only actress who has both posed nude in &quot;Playboy&quot; and won an Academy Award. In a 2000 interview with Charlie Rose, Basinger said that &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; and her next film, &quot;I Dreamed of Africa&quot; (2000), were the most pleasurable of her career.

===2000s===
In &quot;I Dreamed of Africa&quot;, Basinger portrayed writer and environmentalist Kuki Gallmann, with Vincent Pérez, whom she called the &quot;most incredible actor she had ever worked with&quot;. The film was described as a &quot;passion project&quot; for her, and she told &quot;UrbanCinefile&quot; that she &quot;cried for hours&quot; when she had to leave Kenya, where filming took place. Budgeted at US$50 million, &quot;I Dreamed of Africa&quot; got a 10 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and only managed to pull in US$14 million at the worldwide box office.

Curtis Hanson cast her again, this time as the alcoholic mother of an aspiring rapper, in &quot;8 Mile&quot; (2002), opposite Eminem and Brittany Murphy. The film appeared on many top ten lists of the year, and in his review, Roger Ebert asserted: &quot;There has been criticism of Kim Basinger, who is said to be too attractive and even glamorous to play [Eminem]&#x27;s mother, but [...] Her performance finds the right note somewhere between love and exasperation; it cannot be easy to live with this sullen malcontent, whose face lights up only when he sees his baby sister&quot;. &quot;8 Mile&quot; was a commercial success, grossing $242.9 million worldwide.

Basinger starred as the wife of a children&#x27;s book author, with Jeff Bridges and Jon Foster, in &quot;The Door in the Floor&quot; (2004), a drama with heavy sexual themes adapted from the novel &quot;A Widow for One Year&quot; by John Irving. The film found a limited audience in theaters, but in his review, Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, felt that &quot;Basinger&#x27;s haunted beauty burns in the memory&quot; and called it &quot;her finest work&quot;.

Basinger next appeared in two crime thrillers—&quot;Cellular&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (2006). In &quot;Cellular&quot;, opposite Chris Evans and Jason Statham, she played a wealthy high school biology teacher taken hostage in her home. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; considered that &quot;Basinger makes a vividly frightened yet resourceful woman in peril&quot;, and the film was a moderate commercial success. In &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, Basinger portrayed the First Lady of the United States, opposite Michael Douglas, Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria. Despite mixed reviews, the film made US$78.1 million globally. In 2006, Basinger also starred in the Lifetime film &quot;The Mermaid Chair&quot;, as a married woman who falls in love with a Benedictine monk and experiences a self-awakening.

Basinger then played a mother having extramarital affairs in director Guillermo Arriaga&#x27;s feature film debut &quot;The Burning Plain&quot; (2008), a drama narrated in a hyperlink format, opposite Charlize Theron and Jennifer Lawrence. While the film found a limited release in theaters, &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, in its review, wrote: &quot;Arriaga pulls together the strands of his narrative with great expertise [and] his job is made easier by great performances from three actresses: Theron and Basinger, who both look like racing certs for next year&#x27;s awards season, and Jennifer Lawrence as Basinger&#x27;s teenage daughter&quot;.

In 2008, Basinger produced and starred in the independent thriller &quot;While She Was Out&quot;, as a suburban housewife who is forced to fend for herself when she becomes stranded in a desolate forest with four murderous thugs. Despite a very limited release in theaters, &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot; described that film as a &quot;surprisingly enjoyable female revenge tale&quot; and called Basinger&#x27;s performance &quot;first-rate&quot;. Her next film, &quot;The Informers&quot; (2009), which was written by Bret Easton Ellis, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. In it, Basinger starred as the chronically depressed wife of a jaded film executive (played by Billy Bob Thornton).

===2010s===
Basinger played the mother of a young man who made a promise to his deceased brother, with Zac Efron, in the supernatural drama &quot;Charlie St. Cloud&quot; (2010), based on the 2004 best-selling novel &quot;The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud&quot; by Ben Sherwood.

Basinger returned to Africa in her next film, the 2012 Nigerian drama &quot;Black November&quot;, about a Niger Delta community&#x27;s struggle to save their environment, which was being destroyed by excessive oil drilling. As part of an ensemble cast (which included her &quot;9½ Weeks&quot; co-star Mickey Rourke), she played the role of a kidnapped reporter. While the film had a significant impact upon its release, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; noted: &quot;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the names of Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger on the marquee. Despite the tantalizing prospect of a reunion of the stars of a certain &#x27;80s-era hit erotic drama, their minor presence is largely extraneous to the proceedings of [this] overwrought and preachy thriller&quot;.

Basinger played the role of wife in two 2013 films — the independent drama &quot;Third Person&quot;, with Liam Neeson and Olivia Wilde, and the sports comedy &quot;Grudge Match&quot;, with Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone. Critic Odie Henderson, describing Basinger in his review for the latter film, remarked that she &quot;looks stunning at 60 and provides the film&#x27;s sole voice of reason&quot;. She subsequently took on the role of mother in the independent drama &quot;4 Minute Mile&quot; (2014) as well as the part of a woman who, after a miscarriage, sets out on a dangerous quest to obtain a child in the likewise independent production &quot;The 11th Hour&quot; (also 2014), which was released for VOD. &quot;IndieWire&quot; felt that Basinger &quot;does what she can with [&quot;The 11th Hour&quot;] material, but that&#x27;s not much&quot;. In 2016, she had a brief role, as a crooked high-ranking official in the United States Department of Justice, in the crime comedy &quot;The Nice Guys&quot;, alongside Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling.

Basinger played Elena Lincoln, the business partner and former lover of Christian Grey, in the film adaptation of &quot;Fifty Shades Darker&quot; (2017), the sequel to &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;. Dakota Johnson, her co-star, described her as &quot;one of the great people to work with&quot;. Despite negative reviews, the film made US$381.4 million globally. Basinger reprised the role in the 2018 sequel, &quot;Fifty Shades Freed&quot;.

===2020s===
In January 2022, Basinger collaborated with Peter Bogdanovich to create &quot;LIT Project 2: Flux&quot;, a first of its kind short film made available on the Ethereum blockchain as a non-fungible token. She is a prominent character in the video game &quot;Crime Boss: Rockay City&quot; (2023).

==Personal life==
===Marriages and relationships===
Before she was famous, Basinger dated model Tim Saunders, photographer Dale Robinette and football player Joe Namath.

On October 12, 1980, she married makeup artist Ron Snyder-Britton, whom she met on the film &quot;Hard Country&quot;. Basinger developed agoraphobia that same year, following a panic attack in a health-food store, and was housebound for six months. Snyder quit his job during the marriage and changed his surname to Britton after Basinger requested he choose &quot;something with a B&quot; so she could keep the same initials when using her married name. The pair divorced just before Christmas 1989, after which Basinger paid him $9,000 monthly alimony for eight years. Britton wrote a memoir titled &quot;Longer Than Forever&quot;, published in 1998, about their time together and about her affair with Richard Gere, with whom she starred in &quot;No Mercy&quot; (1986) and &quot;Final Analysis&quot; (1992).

While her first divorce was in the works, Basinger had romantic relationships with hairdresser/producer Jon Peters as well as singer Prince, who did the album for &quot;Batman&quot;. She was then involved briefly with fitness trainer Phil Walsh and fashion designer Alexio Gandara.

In 1990, Basinger met her second husband, Alec Baldwin, when they played lovers in &quot;The Marrying Man&quot;. They married on August 19, 1993, and starred in the 1994 remake of &quot;The Getaway&quot;. They also played themselves in a 1998 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in which Basinger corrected Homer Simpson on the pronunciation of her last name and polished her Oscar statuette. Basinger and Baldwin have a daughter, Ireland, born October 23, 1995. They separated at the end of 2000 and divorced on September 3, 2002. In his 2008 book, &quot;A Promise to Ourselves: A Journey Through Fatherhood and Divorce&quot;, Baldwin chronicled the contentious seven-year custody battle with Basinger over their daughter following their separation, contending that she spent more than $1.5 million in her efforts to deny him parental access.

After the divorce from Baldwin, Basinger was reported to be romantically linked with &quot;8 Mile&quot; (2002) co-star Eminem, which the rapper repeatedly denied. She would not have another public attachment until 2014, when she began dating Mitch Stone. Like Snyder and Peters before him, Stone is also Basinger&#x27;s hairstylist. The couple wear matching gold bands and have since moved in together.

===Financial problems===
Some family members recommended Basinger buy the bulk of the privately owned land in the small town of Braselton, Georgia, some 1,691 acres in 1989, for $20 million, to establish it as a tourist attraction with movie studios and a film festival. However, she encountered financial difficulties and started to sell parts of it off in 1995. The town is now owned by developer Wayne Mason. In a 1998 interview with Barbara Walters, Basinger stated that &quot;nothing good came out of it,&quot; because a rift resulted within her family.

Basinger&#x27;s financial difficulties were exacerbated when she pulled out of the film &quot;Boxing Helena&quot; (1993), resulting in the studio winning an $8.9 million judgment against her. Basinger filed for bankruptcy and appealed the decision to a higher court, which ruled in her favor. She and the studio settled for $3.8 million instead.

===Estrangement from family===
Basinger&#x27;s parents were legally married from 1948 to 2016, though they separated in 1980 and had little or no contact for the last 36 years of her father&#x27;s life. Contrary to erroneous reports, they never divorced.

Starting in the mid-1990s, Basinger was estranged from her mother, Ann, and all but one of her four siblings. Her father Don and youngest sister Ashley were the only family members invited to her second wedding in 1993, and the only family members she thanked in her acceptance speech at the Academy Awards in 1998. Basinger was still estranged from her mother as of 2002. However, they appeared to have reconciled by 2015, when Ann told &quot;RadarOnline&quot; in an exclusive interview that Kim would be coming home to Georgia for Christmas.

===Activism===
Basinger is a vegetarian and an animal rights supporter. She has posed for anti-fur advertisements by PETA, and also filmed a public service announcement on downed farm animals for Farm Sanctuary. She was involved in the creation of a bill offering protection to diseased and crippled farm animals, which Governor of California Pete Wilson signed.

==Filmography and awards==
After transitioning from modeling to acting in the late 1970s, Basinger has had over fifty credits in film and television productions, as of 2018. She garnered a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984), and as part of the cast of &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot; (1994), she received an ensemble award from the National Board of Review. She won the Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a BAFTA Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Southeastern Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress in &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1997).

Basinger received a nomination for the Best Actress Award from the Boston Society of Film Critics, for her role in &quot;The Door in the Floor&quot; (2004). Basinger has received seven nominations for the Razzie Awards—six for Worst Actress and one for Worst Supporting Actress—and has been nominated at the People&#x27;s Choice Awards, the Saturn Awards (three times), and the MTV Movie Awards (four times). For her lifetime achievements in the cinematic arts, she has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

<text>Trapped in the Body of a White Girl is a studio album by American comedian Julie Brown, released in 1987.

Brown independently re-released the CD in 2007 via her own pressing and available through her website. The rights to the album were sold in a larger deal to the Noble Rot label, which re-released it officially in 2010.

Though Brown is a comedian, not all of the songs are strictly comedic in nature. The singles &quot;I Like &#x27;Em Big and Stupid&quot;, &quot;Trapped in the Body of a White Girl&quot; and &quot;Girl Fight Tonight!&quot; were released. &quot;Homecoming Queen&quot; was a B-side to &quot;Stupid&quot; and was far more successful and popular, but did not feature on a single of its own. Brown did not release another music recording until 2005.

<text>The Gibbs–Helmholtz equation is a thermodynamic equation used to calculate changes in the Gibbs free energy of a system as a function of temperature. It was originally presented in an 1882 paper entitled &quot;Die Thermodynamik chemischer Vorgänge&quot; by Hermann von Helmholtz. It describes how the Gibbs free energy, which was presented originally by Josiah Willard Gibbs, varies with temperature. It was derived by Helmholtz first, and Gibbs derived it only 6 years later. The attribution to Gibbs goes back to Wilhelm Ostwald, who first translated Gibbs&#x27; monograph into German and promoted it in Europe.

The equation is:

where &quot;H&quot; is the enthalpy, &quot;T&quot; the absolute temperature and &quot;G&quot; the Gibbs free energy of the system, all at constant pressure &quot;p&quot;. The equation states that the change in the &quot;G/T&quot; ratio at constant pressure as a result of an infinitesimally small change in temperature is a factor &quot;H/T&quot;2.

Similar equations include
==Chemical reactions and work==

The typical applications of this equation are to chemical reactions. The equation reads:

:formula_1

with Δ&quot;G&quot; as the change in Gibbs energy due to reaction, and Δ&quot;H&quot; as the enthalpy of reaction (often, but not necessarily, assumed to be independent of temperature). The o denotes the use of standard states, and particularly the choice of a particular standard pressure (1 bar), to calculate Δ&quot;G&quot; and Δ&quot;H&quot;.

Integrating with respect to &quot;T&quot; (again &quot;p&quot; is constant) yields:

:formula_2

This equation quickly enables the calculation of the Gibbs free energy change for a chemical reaction at any temperature &quot;T&quot;2 with knowledge of just the standard Gibbs free energy change of formation and the standard enthalpy change of formation for the individual components.

Also, using the reaction isotherm equation, that is

:formula_3

which relates the Gibbs energy to a chemical equilibrium constant, the van &#x27;t Hoff equation can be derived.

Since the change in a system&#x27;s Gibbs energy is equal to the maximum amount of non-expansion work that the system can do in a process, the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation may be used to estimate how much non-expansion work can be done by a chemical process as a function of temperature. For example, the capacity of rechargeable electric batteries can be estimated as a function of temperature using the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation.

==Derivation==

===Background===

The definition of the Gibbs function is formula_4 where is the enthalpy defined by: formula_5

Taking differentials of each definition to find and , then using the fundamental thermodynamic relation (always true for reversible or irreversible processes):
formula_6
where is the entropy, is volume, (minus sign due to reversibility, in which : work other than pressure-volume may be done and is equal to ) leads to the &quot;reversed&quot; form of the initial fundamental relation into a new master equation:
formula_7

This is the Gibbs free energy for a closed system. The Gibbs–Helmholtz equation can be derived by this second master equation, and the chain rule for partial derivatives.

<text>The homophile movement is a collective term for the main organisations and publications supporting and representing sexual minorities in the 1950s to 1960s around the world. The name comes from the term &quot;homophile&quot;, which was commonly used by these organisations in an effort to deemphasize the sexual aspect of homosexuality. At least some of these organisations are considered to have been more cautious than both earlier and later LGBT organisations; in the U.S., the nationwide coalition of homophile groups disbanded after older members clashed with younger members who had become more radical after the Stonewall riots of 1969.

==History==
The homosexual organizations and publications of the 1950s and 1960s, which commonly used the term &quot;homophile&quot;, are now known collectively as the homophile movement. The term &quot;homophile&quot; was coined by German psychoanalyst Karl-Günther Heimsoth in 1924, before being popularized by the Dutch COC. Proponents of the term hoped to emphasize the romantic rather than sexual aspect of same-sex relationships by replacing the -sexual suffix with the Green root &quot;philos,&quot; meaning love. They hoped to distinguish further by describing people as homophiles, while reserving &quot;homosexual&quot; to describe sexual activity itself.

After the gains made by the homosexual rights movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the vibrant homosexual subcultures of the 1920s and &#x27;30s became silent as war engulfed Europe. Germany was the traditional home of such movements and activists, but in Nazi Germany, gay literature was burned, gay organizations were dissolved, and many gay men imprisoned in concentration camps. The Swiss journal &quot;Der Kreis&quot; (&quot;the circle&quot;) was the primary homosexual publication in Europe and the only one to publish during the Nazi era. &quot;Der Kreis&quot; was edited by Anna Vock, and later Karl Meier; the group gradually shifted from being female-dominated to male-dominated through the 1930s, as the tone of the magazine simultaneously became less militant.

After the war, organizations began to re-form, such as the Dutch COC in 1946. Other, new organizations arose, including Forbundet af 1948 (&quot;League of 1948&quot;), founded by Axel Axgil in Denmark, with publishing an associated magazine called &quot;Vennen&quot; (The Friend) from January 1949 until 1953. Fogedgaard used the pseudonym &quot;Homophilos&quot;, introducing the concept of &quot;homophile&quot; in May 1950, unaware that the word had been presented as an alternative term a few months previously by , one of the founders of the Dutch COC. The word soon spread among members of the emerging post-war movement who were happy to emphasize the respectable romantic side of their relationships over genital sexuality.

A Swedish branch of Forbundet af 1948 was formed in 1949 and a Norwegian branch in 1950. The Swedish organization became independent under the name &quot;Riksförbundet för sexuellt likaberättigande&quot; (RFSL, &quot;Federation for Sexual Equality&quot;) in 1950, led by . The same year in the United States, the Mattachine Society was formed, and other organizations such as ONE, Inc. (1952) and the Daughters of Bilitis (1955) soon followed. Daughters of Bilitis was the first lesbian homophile organization in the U.S., and it emerged in the context of alienation felt by women in male-dominated Mattachine Society and ONE. In 1954, nearly 60,000 copies of ONE&#x27;s magazine were distributed, though its actual readership was likely much higher due to the practice of surreptitiously circulating existing copies. Homophile organizations elsewhere include Arcadie (1954) in France and the British Homosexual Law Reform Society (founded 1958).

These groups are generally considered to have been politically cautious, in comparison to the LGBT movements that both preceded and followed them. Historian Michael Sibalis describes the belief of the French homophile group Arcadie, &quot;that public hostility to homosexuals resulted largely from their outrageous and promiscuous behaviour; homophiles would win the good opinion of the public and the authorities by showing themselves to be discreet, dignified, virtuous and respectable.&quot; However, while some were prepared to come out, they did risk severe persecution, and some figures within the Homophile movement such as the American communist Harry Hay were more radical.

In 1951, the president and vice-president of the Dutch COC initiated an International Congress of European homophile groups, which resulted in the formation of the International Committee for Sexual Equality (ICSE). The ICSE brought together, among other groups, the Forbundet of 1948 (Scandinavia), the Riksförbundet för Sexuellt Likaberättigande (Sweden), Arcadie (France), Der Kreis (Swiss), and, later, ONE (U.S.). Historian Leila Rupp describes the ICSE as a classic example of transnational organizing; &quot;It created a network across national borders, nurtured a transnational homophile identity, and engaged in activism designed to change both laws and minds.&quot; However, the ICSE failed to last beyond the early 1960s due to poor attendance at meetings, lack of active leaders, and failure of members to pay dues.

By the early-1960s, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in the United States were forming more visible communities, and this was reflected in the political strategies of American homophile groups. Frank Kameny, an American astronomer and gay rights activist, had co-founded the Mattachine Society in Washington D.C.in 1961. While the society did not take much political activism to the streets at first, Kameny and several members attended the 1963 March on Washington, where having seen the methods used by Black civil rights activists, they then applied them to the Homophile movement. Kameny had also been inspired by the black power movements slogan &quot;Black is Beautiful&quot;, coining his own term &quot;Gay is Good&quot;. From the mid-1960s, they engaged in picketing and sit-ins, identifying themselves in public space for the first time. Kameny further implemented the use of social protest methods of advocating for rights through his timeline as an activist. While earlier in his career as an activist, he as well as other organizers picketed out the White House. Not only did Kameny continue his work with the Mattachine society, but furthered on to work with other notable gay rights groups like ACT UP, where he continued to use civil disobedience in his efforts to &quot;...accord gays and lesbians the same rights and privileges enjoyed by all citizens.&quot; Formed in 1964, the San Franciscan Society for Individual Rights (SIR) had a new openness and a more participatory democratic structure. SIR was focused on building community, and sponsored drag shows, dinners, bridge clubs, bowling leagues, softball games, field trips, art classes, and meditation groups. In 1966, SIR opened the nation&#x27;s first gay and lesbian community center, and by 1968 they had over 1000 members, making them the largest homophile organization in the country. The world&#x27;s first gay bookstore had opened in New York the year before. A 1965 gay picket held in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, according to some historians, marked the beginning of the modern gay rights movement. Meanwhile, in San Francisco in 1966, transgender street prostitutes in the poor neighborhood of Tenderloin rioted against police harassment at a popular all-night restaurant, the Compton Cafeteria. These and other activities of public resistance to oppression led to a feeling of Gay Liberation that was soon to give a name to a new movement.
In 1963, homophile organizations in New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. joined to form East Coast Homophile Organizations (ECHO) to more closely coordinate their activities. The success of ECHO inspired other homophile groups across the country to explore the idea of forming a national homophile umbrella group. This was done with the formation in 1966 of the North American Conference of Homophile Organizations (NACHO, rhymes with Waco). NACHO held annual conferences, helped start dozens of local gay groups across the country and issued position papers on a variety of LGBT-related issues. It organized national demonstrations, including a May 1966 action against military discrimination that included the country&#x27;s first gay motorcade. Through its legal defense fund, NACHO challenged anti-gay laws and regulations ranging from immigration issues and military service to the legality of serving alcohol to homosexuals. NACHO disbanded after a contentious 1970 conference at which older members and younger members, radicalized in the wake of the 1969 Stonewall riots, clashed. &quot;Gay Sunshine&quot; magazine declared the convention &quot;the battle that ended the homophile movement&quot;. The gay liberation movement, which emerged around this time, replaced the term &quot;homophile&quot; by a new set of terminology such as gay, lesbian, and bisexual.

<text>Paulchoffatiidae is a family of extinct mammals that lived predominantly during the Upper Jurassic period, though a couple of genera are known from the Early Cretaceous. Fossils have been reported from Europe (Portugal, Spain, Germany and England) . Paulchoffatiids were members of the order Multituberculata. They were relatively early representatives and are within the informal suborder of &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot;. The family was named by G. Hahn in 1969, and it honors the Portuguese geologist Léon Paul Choffat. Two subfamilies are recognized.

The most productive fossil site for Paulchoffatiids has been Guimarota, Portugal. Remains from this locality are generally diagnosed on the basis of lower or upper jaws. In only one instance, that of &quot;Kuehneodon&quot;, has it been possible to match the two up. Some of the lower jaws probably represent the same animals as some of the upper, so the diversity of Paulchoffatiids is very possibly exaggerated. As the site is now a flooded, disused coalmine, further excavations are highly unlikely. However, other locations may yet provide more clarity.

The Paulchoffatiids have been further arranged into two subfamilies and a couple of other genera.

&quot;Rugosodon&quot; from the Middle Jurassic of China, known from a mostly complete skeleton, was formerly referred to the family, but was later considered an indeterminate member of the Paulchoffatiid-line.

<text>The paradise parrot (Psephotellus pulcherrimus) was a colourful medium-sized parrot native to the grassy woodlands extending across the Queensland and New South Wales border area of eastern Australia. Once moderately common within its fairly restricted range, the last live bird was seen in 1927. Extensive and sustained searches in the years since then have failed to produce any reliable evidence of it, and it is the only Australian parrot recorded as disappearing and presumed extinct.

==Description==
The plumage was extraordinarily colourful, even by parrot standards, a mixture of turquoise, aqua, scarlet, black and brown. The tail was almost the same length as the body, unusual for a bird that, although a rapid flyer, spent almost all of its time on the ground. 

==Taxonomy==
The description of the species was first published by John Gould in 1845. Gould used the description supplied to him by the field worker John Gilbert, and was suspected to have copied the field notes of Gilbert from a letter that became lost. A letter from Gilbert (May, 1844) describing this parrot was forwarded to Edward Smith-Stanley (Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby), apparently to entice the enthusiast into purchase of specimens in Gould&#x27;s possession. A copy of the Gilbert letter, written out by Stanley, that emerged from an archive in Liverpool in 1985 showed a correlation in the wording. Two specimens, thought to be from the type series used in the first description, were supplied to Stanley and these are held at the Liverpool Museum. The type specimen resides at the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia.

Gilbert&#x27;s diary records his first encounter with the parrot at the Condamine River, where he also obtained specimens. He later met the species at the Comet River to the north, while journeying with the second expedition led by Leichhardt, and made his last recorded sighting in June 1845 at Mitchell River, shortly before he was killed.

The species is allied to genus &quot;Psephotellus&quot; of the parrot family Psittaculidae, published by Gregory Mathews in 1913, and is the type for that description. A study using genome analysis of museum specimens concluded the closest living species is &quot;Psephotellus chrysopterygius&quot;, the alwal or golden-shouldered parrot of north eastern Australia.

==Ecology==
The species was observed in pairs or small family groups, making their nests in hollowed-out termite mounds, often at or near ground level, and feeding, so far as is known, almost exclusively on grass seeds. Some observers state that termitariums were occupied by the same breeding pair in successive years. Less certain is confirmation of holes at riverbanks being tunnelled out by this species. A recorded range of one pair over a month was restricted to an area of two hectares. 
The nest sites were occasionally reported at termitariums previously occupied by the kingfisher &quot;Todiramphus macleayii&quot; or in burrows of a kookaburra &quot;Dacelo leachii&quot; (North, 1889), or at the base of a tree (Campbell, 1901).

The reasons for the sudden decline of the paradise parrot remain speculative. Possibilities include overgrazing, land clearing, changed fire regimes, hunting by bird collectors, and predation by introduced mammals like cats and dogs. It became rare towards the end of the 19th century and by 1915 was thought to be possibly extinct. A severe drought in the region during 1902 may have been a factor in its demise, and where the new pastoralist practices were introduced the burning by graziers to encourage fodder for their stock resulted in the loss of seasonal foods. 

A collection of these eggs was made at Maryborough and another by George Barnard at Fraser River, A. J. North recorded measurements for these in catalogue of nests and eggs by the Australian Museum (1889). The Maryborough collection were 0.88 × 0.73; 0.86 × 0.71; 0.9 × 0.74 inches and the Barnard collection at Dawson River made September 1883 were 0.86 × 0.71; 0.87 × 0.7; 0.87 × 0.71 inches. Another sample of one &#x27;proper&#x27; clutch by A. J. Campbell (1901) reports five eggs in inches as 0.84 × 0.7; 0.84 × 0.67; 0.81 × 0.69; 0.79 × 0.68; and of outliers in size as 0.94 × 0.76 and 0.85 × 0.69 inches. His description of the round oval eggs is having a finely grained pure white shell with a slight gloss, in clutch of four to five eggs.

When comparing the genetic diversity of the Paradise Parrot to genomes of endangered birds, you find that the Paradise Parrot is more genetically diverse than those currently listed as endangered. Research has shown that population size of the Paradise Parrot has dramatically changed with temperature since the last glacial cycle.

A series of searches turned up a few more individuals over the next decade, but the last confirmed sighting was on 14 September 1927.

The &quot;Atlas of Australian birds&quot; (RAOU, 1984) noted it was not reported in the field during the survey (&quot;Field Atlas&quot;, 1977–81). The historical reports are commonly from an area in the southeast of Queensland, showing a rapid decline after the 1880s. 
The species had occurred at the Duaringa district until 1902. 
An attempt to solicit reports from the public in 1918, after a dearth of observations, indicated the presence at several locations. 
Confirmed sightings were made 1926–27 at widely separated locations of the known range, at Casino, New South Wales (November 1926) and near Ipswich (1927) and Burnett River (November, 1927). 
Unconfirmed reports from the north of the recorded range may be complicated by misidentified observations of the rare golden-shouldered parrot (&quot;Psephotellus chrysopterygius&quot;). The early report of occurrence at Mitchell River (Queensland) in 1848 is regarded as reliable, and historical records of local occurrences near Coen and Archer River in the 1920s noted as possible.

<text>Ink wash painting (); is a type of Chinese ink brush painting which uses washes of black ink, such as that used in East Asian calligraphy, in different concentrations. It emerged during the Tang dynasty of China (618–907), and overturned earlier, more realistic techniques. It is typically monochrome, using only shades of black, with a great emphasis on virtuoso brushwork and conveying the perceived &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;essence&quot; of a subject over direct imitation. Ink wash painting flourished from the Song dynasty in China (960–1279) onwards, as well as in Japan after it was introduced by Zen Buddhist monks in the 14th century. Some Western scholars divide Chinese painting (including ink wash painting) into three periods: times of representation, times of expression, and historical Oriental art. Chinese scholars have their own views which may be different; they believe that contemporary Chinese ink wash paintings are the pluralistic continuation of multiple historical traditions.

In China, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Korea, ink wash painting formed a distinct stylistic tradition with a different set of artists working in it than from those in other types of painting. In China especially it was a gentlemanly occupation associated with poetry and calligraphy. It was often produced by the scholar-official or literati class, ideally illustrating their own poetry and producing the paintings as gifts for friends or patrons, rather than painting for payment.

In practice a talented painter often had an advantage in climbing the bureaucratic ladder. In Korea, painters were less segregated, and more willing to paint in two techniques, such as mixing areas of colour with monochrome ink, for example in painting the faces of figures.

The vertical hanging scroll was the classic format; the long horizontal handscroll format tended to be associated with professional coloured painting, but was also used for literati painting. In both formats paintings were generally kept rolled up, and brought out for the owner to admire, often with a small group of friends. Chinese collectors liked to stamp paintings with their seals and usually in red inkpad; sometimes they would add poems or notes of appreciation. Some old and famous paintings have become very disfigured by this; the Qianlong Emperor was a particular offender.

In landscape painting the scenes depicted are typically imaginary or very loose adaptations of actual views. The style of mountain landscapes are by far the most common, often evoking particular areas traditionally famous for their beauty, from which the artist may have been very distant.

==Philosophy==


East Asian writing on aesthetics is generally consistent in saying that the goal of ink and wash painting is not simply to reproduce the appearance of the subject, but to capture its spirit. To paint a horse the ink-wash painting artist must understand its temperament better than its muscles and bones. To paint a flower there is no need to perfectly match its petals and colors, but it is essential to convey its liveliness and fragrance. It has been compared to the later Western movement of Impressionism. It is also particularly associated with the Chán or Zen sect of Buddhism, which emphasizes &quot;simplicity, spontaneity and self-expression&quot;, and Daoism, which emphasizes &quot;spontaneity and harmony with nature,&quot; especially when compared with the less spiritually-oriented Confucianism.

East Asian ink wash painting has long inspired modern artists in the West. In his classic book &quot;Composition&quot;, American artist and educator Arthur Wesley Dow (1857–1922) wrote this about ink wash painting: &quot;The painter... put upon the paper the fewest possible lines and tones; just enough to cause form, texture and effect to be felt. Every brush-touch must be full-charged with meaning, and useless detail eliminated. Put together all the good points in such a method, and you have the qualities of the highest art&quot;. Dow&#x27;s fascination with ink wash painting not only shaped his own approach to art but also helped free many American modernists of the era, including his student Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, from what he called a &quot;story-telling&quot; approach. Dow strived for harmonic compositions through three elements: line, shading, and color. He advocated practicing with East Asian brushes and ink to develop aesthetic acuity with line and shading.

==Technique, materials and tools==
Ink wash painting uses tonality and shading achieved by varying the ink density, both by differential grinding of the ink stick in water and by varying the ink load and pressure within a single brushstroke. Ink wash painting artists spend years practicing basic brush strokes to refine their brush movement and ink flow. These skills are closely related to those needed for basic writing in East Asian characters, and then for calligraphy, which essentially use the same ink and brushes. In the hand of a master, a single stroke can produce considerable variations in tonality, from deep black to silvery gray. Thus, in its original context, shading means more than just dark-light arrangement: It is the basis for the nuance in tonality found in East Asian ink wash painting and brush-and-ink calligraphy.

Once a stroke is painted it cannot be changed or erased. As a result, ink and wash painting is a technically demanding art form requiring great skill, concentration, and years of training.

The Four Treasures is summarized in a four-word couplet: &quot;,&quot; (Pinyin: ) &quot;The four jewels of the study: Brush, Ink, Paper, Inkstone&quot; by Chinese scholar-official or literati class, which are also indispensable tools and materials for East Asian painting.

===Brush===
The earliest intact ink brush was found in 1954 in the tomb of a Chu citizen from the Warring States period (475–221 BCE) located in an archaeological dig site near Changsha. This primitive version of an ink brush found had a wooden stalk and a bamboo tube securing the bundle of hair to the stalk. Legend wrongly credits the invention of the ink brush to the later Qin general Meng Tian. Traces of a writing brush, however, were discovered on the Shang jades, and were suggested to be the grounds of the oracle bone script inscriptions.

The writing brush entered a new stage of development in the Han dynasty. First, the decorative craft of engraving and inlaying on the pen-holder appeared. Second, some writings on the production of writing brush have also survived. For example, the first monograph on the selection, production and function of a writing brush was written by Cai Yong in the eastern Han dynasty. Third, the special form of &quot;hairpin white pen&quot; appeared. Officials in the Han dynasty often sharpened the end of the brush and stuck it in their hair or hat for their convenience. Worshipers also often put pen on their heads to show respect.

During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, a group of pen making experts emerged in Huzhou. They included Wu Yunhui, Feng Yingke, Lu Wenbao, Zhang Tianxi, and others. Huzhou has been the center of Chinese brush making since the Qing dynasty. At the same time, many famous brushes were produced in other places, such as the Ruyang Liu brush in Henan province, the Li Dinghe brush in Shanghai, and the Wu Yunhui in Jiangxi province.

Ink wash painting brushes are similar to the brushes used for calligraphy and are traditionally made from bamboo with goat, cattle, horse, sheep, rabbit, marten, badger, deer, boar and wolf hair. The brush hairs are tapered to a fine point, a feature vital to the style of wash paintings.

Different brushes have different qualities. A small wolf-hair brush that is tapered to a fine point can deliver an even thin line of ink (much like a pen). A large wool brush (one variation called the &#x27;big cloud&#x27;) can hold a large volume of water and ink. When the big cloud brush rains down upon the paper, it delivers a graded swath of ink encompassing myriad shades of gray to black.

===Inkstick===
Ink wash painting is usually done on rice paper (Chinese) or washi (Japanese paper) both of which are highly absorbent and unsized. Silk is also used in some forms of ink painting. Many types of Xuan paper and do not lend themselves readily to a smooth wash the way watercolor paper does. Each brush stroke is visible, so any &quot;wash&quot; in the sense of Western style painting requires partially sized paper. Paper manufacturers today understand artists&#x27; demands for more versatile papers and work to produce kinds that are more flexible. If one uses traditional paper, the idea of an &quot;ink wash&quot; refers to a wet-on-wet technique, applying black ink to paper where a lighter ink has already been applied, or by quickly manipulating watery diluted ink once it has been applied to the paper by using a very large brush.

In ink wash paintings, as in calligraphy, artists usually grind inkstick over an inkstone to obtain black ink, but prepared liquid inks ( in Japanese) are also available. Most inksticks are made of soot from pine or oil combined with animal glue. An artist puts a few drops of water on an inkstone and grinds the inkstick in a circular motion until a smooth, black ink of the desired concentration is made. Prepared liquid inks vary in viscosity, solubility, concentration, etc., but are in general more suitable for practicing Chinese calligraphy than executing paintings. Inksticks themselves are sometimes ornately decorated with landscapes or flowers in bas-relief and some are highlighted with gold.

===Xuan paper===
Paper (Chinese: &quot;traditional&quot; , &quot;simplified&quot; ; Pinyin: &quot;&quot;) was first developed in China in the first decade of 100 AD. Previous to its invention, bamboo slips and silks were used for writing material. Several methods of paper production developed over the centuries in China. However, the paper which was considered of highest value was that of the Jingxian in Anhui Province. Xuan paper features great tensile strength, smooth surface, pure and clean texture as well as a clean stroke; it has great resistance to crease, corrosion, moth, and mold. Xuan paper has a special ink penetration effect, which is not readily available in paper made in Western countries. It was first mentioned in ancient Chinese books &quot;Notes of Past Famous Paintings&quot; and &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;. It was originally produced in the Tang dynasty in Jing County, which was under the jurisdiction of Xuan Prefecture (Xuanzhou), hence the name Xuan paper. During the Tang dynasty, the paper was often a mixture of hemp (the first fiber used for paper in China) and mulberry fiber.

The materials used in Xuan paper are closely related to the geographical environment of Jingxian. The bark of the &quot;Pteroceltis tatarinowii&quot;, a common variety of elm, is used as the main material for the production of rice paper in this area. Rice and several other materials were later added to the recipe in the Song and Yuan Dynasties. In those dynasties bamboo and mulberry began to be used to produce rice paper as well.

The production of Xuan paper is about an eighteen-step process – taken in detail over a hundred steps may be counted. Some paper makers keep their process strictly secret. The process includes cooking and bleaching the bark of &quot;Pteroceltis tatarinowii&quot; and adding various fruit juices.

===Inkstone===
The inkstone is not only a traditional Chinese stationery device, but also an important tool of ink painting. It is a stone mortar used for the grinding and containment of ink. In addition to stones, inkstones can be made of clay, bronze, iron and porcelain. This device evolved from the friction tool used to rub dyes about six to seven thousand years ago.

==History and artists==

===Chinese painters and their influence on East Asia===
In Chinese painting, brush painting was one of the &quot;four arts&quot; expected to be learnt by China&#x27;s class of scholar-officials. Ink wash painting appeared during the Tang dynasty (618–907), and its early development is credited to Wang Wei (active in the 8th century) and Zhang Zao, among others. In the Ming dynasty, Dong Qichang would identify two distinct styles: a clearer, grander Northern School ( or or , Japanese: or ), and a freer, more expressive Southern School ( or or , Japanese: or ), also called &quot;Literati Painting&quot; (, Japanese: ).

====Tang, Song and Yuan dynasties====
Western scholars have written that before the Song dynasty, ink wash was primarily used for representation painting, while in the Yuan dynasty, expressive painting predominated. Chinese historical views have traditionally found it more appropriate to divide the general artistic features of this historical stage by the theory of Southern School and Northern School, as promulgated Dong Qichang in the Ming dynasty.

=====Southern School and painters=====
Southern School () of Chinese painting, often called &quot; painting&quot; (), is a term used to denote art and artists which stand in opposition to the formal Northern School of painting. Representing painters are Wang Wei, Dong Yuan, and so on. The Southern School has had a profound impact on Japanese and Southeast Asian paintings.
Wang Wei (; 699–759), Zhang Zao ( or ) and Dong Yuan (, Gan: ; ) are important representatives of early Chinese ink wash painting of the Southern School. Wang Wei was a Chinese poet, musician, painter, and politician during the Tang dynasty, 8th century. Wang Wei is the most important representative of early Chinese ink wash painting. He believed that in all forms of painting, ink wash painting is the most advanced. Zhang Zao was a Chinese painter, painting theorist and politician during the Tang dynasty, 8th century. He created the method of using fingers instead of brush to draw ink wash painting.
Dong Yuan was a Chinese painter during the Five Dynasties (10th century). His ink wash painting style is considered by Dong Qichang to be the most typical style of Southern School.

Chinese ink wash painters such as Li Cheng (; 919–967), Courtesy name (), Fan Kuan (, ), courtesy name &quot;Zhongli&quot; and &quot;Zhongzheng&quot;, better known by his pseudonym &quot;Fan Kuan&quot; and Guo Xi () () had a great influence on East Asian ink wash painting. Li Cheng was a Chinese painter of the Song dynasty. He was influenced by Jing Hao, Juran. Li Cheng has a profound impact on Japanese and Korean painters.
Fan Kuan was a Chinese landscape painter of the Song dynasty. He has a profound impact on Japanese and Korean paintings.
Guoxi was a Chinese landscape painter from Henan Province who lived during the Northern Song dynasty. One text entitled &quot;The Lofty Message of Forest and Streams&quot; ( ) is attributed to him.

As representatives of scholar painting (or &quot;Literati Painting&quot;, the part of the Southern School), painters such as Su Shi, Mi Fu and Mi Youren, especially Muqi, had a decisive influence on East Asian ink wash painting. Su Shi (; 8 January 1037 – 24 August 1101), courtesy name Zizhan (Chinese: 子瞻), art name Dongpo (Chinese: 東坡), was a Chinese poet, writer, politician, calligrapher, painter, pharmacologist, and gastronome of the Song dynasty.
Mi Fu (, also given as Mi Fei, 1051–1107) was a Chinese painter, poet, and calligrapher born in Taiyuan during the Song dynasty.
Mi Youren (, 1074–1153) was a Chinese painter, poet, and calligrapher born in Taiyuan during the Song dynasty. He was the eldest son of Mi Fu.
Muqi (; Japanese: Mokkei; 1210?–1269?), also known as Fachang (), was a Chinese Chan Buddhist monk and painter who lived in the 13th century, around the end of the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279). Today, he is considered to be one of the greatest Chan painters in history. His ink paintings, such as the Daitoku-ji triptych and &quot;Six Persimmons&quot; are regarded as essential Chan paintings. Muqi&#x27;s style of painting has also profoundly impacted painters from later periods to follow, especially monk painters in Japan.

Four Masters of the Yuan dynasty () is a name used to collectively describe the four Chinese painters Huang Gongwang (, 1269–1354), Wu Zhen (, 1280–1354), Ni Zan (; 1301–1374), and Wang Meng (, Wáng Méng; &quot;Zi&quot;: Shūmíng , &quot;Hao&quot;: Xiāngguāng Jūshì ) (), who were active during the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). They were revered during the Ming dynasty and later periods as major exponents of the tradition of &quot;literati painting&quot; (), which was concerned more with individual expression and learning than with outward representation and immediate visual appeal.
Other notable painters from the Yuan period include Gao Kegong (; 1248–1310), also a poet, and was known for his landscapes, and Fang Congyi.

=====Northern School and painters=====
Northern School () was a manner of Chinese landscape painting centered on a loose group of artists who worked and lived in Northern China during the Five Dynasties period that occupied the time between the collapse of the Tang dynasty and the rise of the Song. Representing painters are Ma Yuan, Xia Gui, and so on. The style stands in opposition to the Southern School () of Chinese painting. Northern School has a profound impact on Japanese and Southeast Asian paintings.

Li Tang (, courtesy name Xigu (); c. 1050 – 1130) of the Northern School, especially Ma Yuan (; ) and Xia Gui&#x27;s ink wash painting modeling and techniques have a profound influence on Japanese and Korean ink wash paintings. Li Tang was a Chinese landscape painter who practised at Kaifeng and Hangzhou during the Song dynasty. He forms a link between earlier painters such as Guo Xi, Fan Kuan and Li Cheng and later artists such as Xia Gui and Ma Yuan. He perfected the technique of &quot;axe-cut&quot; brush-strokes.
Ma Yuan was a Chinese painter of the Song dynasty. His works, together with that of Xia Gui, formed the basis of the so-called Ma-Xia () school of painting, and are considered among the finest from the period. His works has inspired both Chinese artists of the Zhe School, as well as the great early Japanese painters Shūbun and Sesshū.
Xia Gui (; fl. 1195–1225), courtesy name Yuyu (), was a Chinese landscape painter of the Song dynasty. Very little is known about his life, and only a few of his works survive, but he is generally considered one of China&#x27;s greatest artists. He continued the tradition of Li Tang, further simplifying the earlier Song style to achieve a more immediate, striking effect. Together with Ma Yuan, he founded the so-called Ma-Xia () school, one of the most important of the period. Although Xia was popular during his lifetime, his reputation suffered after his death, together with that of all Southern Song academy painters. Nevertheless, a few artists, including the Japanese master Sesshū, continued Xia&#x27;s tradition for hundreds of years, until the early 17th century.

Liang Kai (; ) was a Chinese painter of the Southern Song dynasty. He was also known as &quot;Madman Liang&quot; because of his very informal pictures. His ink wash painting style has a huge influence on East Asia, especially Japan.
Yan Hui (); was a late 13th century Chinese painter who lived during the Southern Song and early Yuan dynasties. Yan Hui&#x27;s style of painting has also profoundly impacted the painters in Japan.

====Ming and Qing dynasties====
Four Masters of the Ming dynasty () are a traditional grouping in Chinese art history of four famous Chinese painters of the Ming dynasty. The group are Shen Zhou (, 1427–1509), Wen Zhengming (, 1470–1559), both of the Wu School, Tang Yin (, 1470–1523), and Qiu Ying (, ). They were approximate contemporaries, with Shen Zhou the teacher of Wen Zhengming, while the other two studied with Zhou Chen. Their styles and subject matter were varied.

Xu Wei (, 1521–1593) and Chen Chun (; 1483–1544) are the main painters of the bold and unconstrained style of literati painting, and their ink wash painting is characterized by the incisive and fluent ink and wash. Their ink wash painting style is considered to have the typical characteristics of the Historical Oriental art. Xu Wei, other department &quot;Qingteng Shanren&quot; (), was a Ming dynasty Chinese painter, poet, writer and dramatist famed for his artistic expressiveness.
Chen Chun was a Ming dynasty artist. Born into a wealthy family of scholar-officials in Suzhou, he learned calligraphy from Wen Zhengming, one of the Four Masters of the Ming dynasty. Chén Chún later broke with Wen to favor a more freestyle method of ink wash painting.

Dong Qichang (; 1555–1636) of the Ming dynasty and the Four Wangs () of the Qing dynasty are representative painters of retro-style ink wash paintings that imitated the painting style before the Yuan dynasty. Dong Qichang was a Chinese painter, calligrapher, politician, and art theorist of the later period of the Ming dynasty. He is the founder of the theory of Southern School and Northern School in ink wash painting. His theoretical system has a great influence on the painting concept and practice of East Asian countries, including Japan and Korea.
Four Wangs were four Chinese landscape painters in the 17th century, all called Wang (surname Wang). They are best known for their accomplishments in painting.They were Wang Shimin (1592–1680), Wang Jian (1598–1677), Wang Hui (1632–1717) and Wang Yuanqi (1642–1715).

Bada Shanren (, born &quot;Zhu Da&quot;; ), Shitao (; other department &quot;Yuan Ji&quot; (), 1642–1707) and Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou () are the innovative masters of ink wash painting in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Bada Shanren, other department &quot;Bada Shanren&quot; (), was a Han Chinese painter of ink wash painting and a calligrapher. He was of royal descent, being a direct offspring of the Ming dynasty prince Zhu Quan who had a feudal establishment in Nanchang. Art historians have named him as a brilliant painter of the period.
Shitao, born into the Ming dynasty imperial clan as &quot;Zhu Ruoji&quot; , was one Chinese landscape painter in early Qing dynasty (1644–1912).
Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou is the name for a group of eight Chinese painters active in the 18th century, who were known in the Qing dynasty for rejecting the orthodox ideas about painting in favor of a style deemed expressive and individualist.

Xu Gu (, 1824–1896) was a Chinese monk painter and poet during the Qing dynasty. His ink wash paintings give the audience a sense of abstraction and illusion.

====Modern times====
Modern and contemporary Chinese freehand ink wash painting is the most famous of the Shanghai School, and the most representative ones are the following painters. Wu Changshuo ( 12 September 1844 – 29 November 1927, also romanised as Wu Changshi, ), born Wu Junqing (), was a prominent painter, calligrapher and seal artist of the late Qing period. He is the leader of the Shanghai School. Wu Changshuo&#x27;s style of painting has profoundly impacted the paintings in Japan.
Pu Hua (; ) was a Chinese landscape painter and calligrapher during the Qing dynasty. His style name was &#x27;Zuo Ying&#x27;. Pu painted landscapes and ink bamboo in an unconventional style of free and easy brush strokes. He is one of the important representatives of the Shanghai School.
Wang Zhen (; 1867–1938), commonly known by his courtesy name Wang Yiting (), was a prominent businessman and celebrated modern Chinese artist of the Shanghai School.
Qi Baishi (, 1 January 1864 – 16 September 1957) was a Chinese painter noted for the whimsical, often playful style of his ink wash painting works.
Huang Binhong (; 1865–1955) was a Chinese literati painter and art historian born in Jinhua, Zhejiang province. His ancestral home was She County, Anhui province. He was the grandson of artist Huang Fengliu. He would later be associated with Shanghai and finally Hangzhou. He is considered one of the last innovators in the literati style of painting and is noted for his freehand landscapes.

Important painters who have absorbed Western sketching methods to improve Chinese ink wash painting include Gao Jianfu, Xu Beihong and Liu Haisu, etc. Gao Jianfu (1879–1951; , pronounced &quot;Gou Gim Fu&quot; in Cantonese) was a Chinese painter and social activist. He is known for leading the Lingnan School&#x27;s effort to modernize Chinese traditional ink wash painting as a &quot;new national art.&quot;
Xu Beihong (; 19 July 1895 – 26 September 1953), also known as &quot;Ju Péon&quot;, was a Chinese painter. He was primarily known for his Chinese ink paintings of horses and birds and was one of the first Chinese artists to articulate the need for artistic expressions that reflected a modern China at the beginning of the 20th century. He was also regarded as one of the first to create monumental oil paintings with epic Chinese themes – a show of his high proficiency in an essential Western art technique. He was one of the four pioneers of Chinese modern art who earned the title of &quot;The Four Great Academy Presidents&quot;.
Liu Haisu (; 16 March 1896 – 7 August 1994) was a prominent 20th century Chinese painter and a noted art educator. He excelled in Chinese painting and oil painting. He was one of the four pioneers of Chinese modern art who earned the title of &quot;The Four Great Academy Presidents&quot;.

Pan Tianshou, Zhang Daqian and Fu Baoshi are important ink wash painters who stick to the tradition of Chinese classical Literati Painting. Pan Tianshou (; 1897–1971) was a Chinese painter and art educator. Pan was born in Guanzhuang, Ninghai County, Zhejiang Province, and graduated from Zhejiang First Normal School (now Hangzhou High School). He studied Chinese traditional painting with Wu Changshuo. Later he created his own ink wash painting style and built the foundation of Chinese traditional painting education. He was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution until his death in 1971.
Zhang Daqian (; 10 May 1899 – 2 April 1983) was one of the best-known and most prodigious Chinese artists of the 20th century. Originally known as a (traditionalist) painter, by the 1960s he was also renowned as a modern impressionist and expressionist painter. In addition, he is regarded as one of the most gifted master forgers of the 20th century.
Fu Baoshi (; 1904–1965), was a Chinese painter. He also taught in the Art Department of Central University (now Nanjing University). His works of landscape painting employed skillful use of dots and inking methods, creating a new technique encompassing many varieties within traditional rules.

Shi Lu (; 1919–1982), born &quot;Feng Yaheng&quot; (), was a Chinese painter, wood block printer, poet and calligrapher. He based his pseudonym on two artists who greatly influenced him, the landscape painter Shitao and writer Lu Xun. He created two different ink wash painting styles.

===Other countries in East Asia===
Since the Tang dynasty, Japan, Korea, and East Asian countries have extensively studied Chinese painting and ink wash painting. Josetsu () who immigrated to Japan from China has been called the &quot;Father of Japanese ink painting&quot;. East Asian styles have mainly developed from the painting styles of Southern School and Northern School.

====Korea====
Ink wash painting was most likely brought to Korea during the Goryeo dynasty, although no confirmed examples are extant; a number of works preserved in Japanese Buddhist temples are possibly by Korean authors, but this is limited to speculation. Nonetheless, it would continue to develop as a major genre of Korean painting in the following Joseon dynasty as well.

In Korea, the Dohwaseo or court academy was very important, and most major painters came from it, although the emphasis of the academy was on realistic decorative works and official portraits, so something of a break from this was required. However the high official and painter Gang Se-hwang and others championed amateur literati or painting in the Chinese sensibility. Many painters made both Chinese-style landscapes and genre paintings of everyday life, and there was a tradition of more realistic landscapes of real locations, as well as mountains as fantastical as any Chinese paintings, for which the Taebaek Mountains along the eastern side of Korea offered plenty of inspiration.

An Kyŏn was a painter of the early Joseon period. He was born in Jigok, Seosan, South Chungcheong Province. He entered royal service as a member of the Dohwaseo, the official painters of the Joseon court, and drew () for Prince Anpyeong in 1447 which is currently stored at Tenri University. This piece is the oldest surviving Korean piece for which the author and date of composition are known. He was deeply influenced by the Southern School () of Chinese painting, especially Li Cheng and Guo Xi.

Byeon Sang-byeok, member of the Miryang Byeon clan, was active during the latter half of the Joseon period (1392–1910). Byeon is famous for his precise depictions of animals and people in detailed brushwork. Byeon was deeply influenced by the Court Painting () of Chinese painting, especially Huang Quan.

The Korean painters influenced by the Northern School in the Song dynasty include Kang Hŭian, Kim Hong-do, Jang Seung-eop and so on. Kang Hŭian (1417?–1464), pen name Injae , was a prominent scholar and painter of the early Joseon period. He was good at poetry, calligraphy, and painting. He entered royal service by passing gwageo in 1441 under the reign of king Sejong (1397–1418–1450). Kim Hong-do (, born 1745, died 1806?–1814?), also known as &quot;Kim Hong-do&quot;, most often styled &quot;Danwon&quot; (), was a full-time painter of the Joseon period of Korea. He was together a pillar of the establishment and a key figure of the new trends of his time, the &#x27;true view painting&#x27;. Gim Hong-do was an exceptional artist in every field of traditional painting. His ink wash paintings of figures are deeply influenced by the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou. Jang Seung-eop (1843–1897) (commonly known by his pen name &quot;Owon&quot;) was a painter of the late Joseon dynasty in Korea. His life was dramatized in the award-winning 2002 film &quot;Chi-hwa-seon&quot; directed by Im Kwon-taek. He was also one of few painters to hold a position of rank in the Joseon court.

Jeong Seon () (1676–1759) was a landscape painter, also known by his pen name &quot;Kyomjae&quot; (&quot;humble study&quot;), who is counted among the most famous Korean painters. His style was realistic rather than abstract, and he additionally is credited with advancing the ink-wash artform towards a more uniquely Korean direction. His works include ink and oriental water paintings, such as &quot;Inwangjesaekdo&quot; (1751), &quot;Geumgang jeondo&quot; (1734), and &quot;Ingokjeongsa&quot; (1742), as well as numerous &quot;true-view&quot; landscape paintings (진경산수화) on the subject of Korea and the history of its culture. This latter style, which was a subgenre of the &quot;shan-shui&quot; genre, was most prominent between the mid-18th century and mid-19th century, and was pursued by several other painters as well. Moreover, this style spread to Japan through Choe Buk and Kim Yu-seong as part of diplomatic missions to Japan, where it was sometimes known as &quot;New Joseon &quot;Shan-shui&quot; painting&quot; (新朝鮮山水畫), and influenced Ike no Taiga and Uragami Gyokudō.

====Japan====
In Japan, the style was introduced in the 14th century, during the Muromachi period (1333–1573) through Zen Buddhist monasteries, and in particular Josetsu, a painter who immigrated from China and taught the first major early painter Tenshō Shūbun (d. ). Both he and his pupil Sesshū Tōyō (1420–1506) were monks, although Sesshū eventually left the clergy, and spent a year or so in China in 1468–69. By the end of the period the style had been adopted by several professional or commercial artists, especially from the large Kanō school founded by Kanō Masanobu (1434–1530); his son Kanō Motonobu was also very important. In the Japanese way, the most promising pupils married daughters of the family, and changed their names to Kanō. The school continued to paint in the traditional Japanese and other coloured styles as well.

A Japanese innovation of the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568–1600) was to use the monochrome style on a much larger scale in folding screens, often produced in sets so that they ran all round even large rooms. The of about 1595 is a famous example; only some 15% of the paper is painted.

 was one of the first &quot;suiboku&quot; (ink wash) style Zen Japanese painters in the Muromachi period (15th century). He was probably also a teacher of Tenshō Shūbun at the Shōkoku-ji monastery in Kyoto. A Chinese immigrant, he was naturalised in 1470 and is known as the &quot;Father of Japanese ink painting&quot;.

Kanō school, a Japanese ink wash painting genre, was born under the significant influence of Chinese Taoism and Buddhist culture. was the leader of Kano school, laid the foundation for the school&#x27;s dominant position in Japanese mainstream painting for centuries. He was mainly influenced by Xia Gui (active in 1195–1225), a Chinese court painter of the Southern Song dynasty. He was the chief painter of the Ashikaga shogunate and is generally considered the founder of the Kanō school of painting. Kano Masanobu specialized in Zen paintings as well as elaborate paintings of Buddhist deities and Bodhisattvas.
 was a Japanese Zen Buddhist monk and painter of the Muromachi period. He was deeply influenced by the Northern School () of Chinese painting and Josetsu.
Sesshū Tōyō (; Oda Tōyō since 1431, also known as &quot;Tōyō&quot;, &quot;Unkoku&quot;, or &quot;Bikeisai&quot;; 1420 – 26 August 1506) was the most prominent Japanese master of ink and wash painting from the middle Muromachi period. He was deeply influenced by the Northern School () of Chinese painting, especially Ma Yuan and Xia Gui.
After studying landscape painting in China, he drew &quot;&quot;. This painting was drawn the landscape of Song dynasty in China.
He painted the natural landscape of winter. The feature of this painting is the thick line that represents the cliff.

 and mainly imitated the ink wash painting styles of the Chinese Song dynasty monk painter Muqi. Sesson Shukei was one of the main representatives of Japanese ink wash painting, a learned and prolific Zen monk painter. He studied a wide range of early Chinese ink wash painting styles and played an important role in the development of Japanese Zen ink wash painting. Colleagues of Chinese ink painter Muqi (active in 13th century) first brought Muxi painting to Japan in the late 13th century. Japanese Zen monks follow and learn the gibbon pictures painted by Chinese monk painter Muqi. By the late 15th century, the animal image of Muqi style had become a hot topic in large-scale Japanese painting projects.

The smaller, more purist and less flamboyant Hasegawa school was founded by Hasegawa Tōhaku (1539–1610), and lasted until the 18th century. The (meaning &quot;Southern painting&quot;) or (&quot;literati&quot;) style or school ran from the 18th century until the death of Tomioka Tessai (1837–1924) who was widely regarded as the last of the artists.
Hasegawa Tōhaku was a Japanese painter and founder of the Hasegawa school. He is considered one of the great painters of the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–1603), and he is best known for his &quot;byōbu&quot; folding screens, such as &quot;Pine Trees&quot; and &quot;Pine Tree and Flowering Plants&quot; (both registered National Treasures), or the paintings in walls and sliding doors at Chishaku-in, attributed to him and his son (also National Treasures). He was deeply influenced by Chinese painting of the Song dynasty, especially Liang Kai and Muqi.

The ink wash paintings of Mi Fu and his son had a profound influence on Japanese ink painters, and Ike no Taiga is one of them. was a Japanese painter and calligrapher born in Kyoto during the Edo period. Together with Yosa Buson, he perfected the (or &quot;nanga&quot;) genre. The majority of his works reflected his passion for classical Chinese culture and painting techniques, though he also incorporated revolutionary and modern techniques into his otherwise very traditional paintings. As a (, literati, man of letters), Ike was close to many of the prominent social and artistic circles in Kyoto, and in other parts of the country, throughout his lifetime.

<text>The long-tailed shrike or rufous-backed shrike (Lanius schach) is a member of the bird family Laniidae, the shrikes. They are found widely distributed across Asia and there are variations in plumage across the range. The species ranges across much of Asia, both on the mainland and the eastern archipelagos. The eastern or Himalayan subspecies, &quot;L. s. tricolor&quot;, is sometimes called the black-headed shrike. Although there are considerable differences in plumage among the subspecies, they all have a long and narrow black tail, have a black mask and forehead, rufous rump and flanks and a small white patch on the shoulder. It is considered to form a superspecies with the grey-backed shrike (&quot;Lanius tephronotus&quot;) which breeds on the Tibetan Plateau.

==Taxonomy==
The long-tailed shrike was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Lanius schach&quot;. Linnaeus cited the description that the Swedish explorer Pehr Osbeck had included in the account of his stay in China. The type locality is the Canton area of China. The genus name, &quot;Lanius&quot;, is derived from the Latin word for &quot;butcher&quot;, and some shrikes are also known as &quot;butcher birds&quot; because of their feeding habits. The specific &quot;schach&quot; is an onomatopoeic name based on the call. The common English name &quot;shrike&quot; is from Old English &quot;scríc&quot;, &quot;shriek&quot;, referring to the shrill call.

Nine subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;L. s. erythronotus&quot; (Vigors, 1831) – south Kazakhstan to northeast Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and north-central India
* &quot;L. s. caniceps&quot; Blyth, 1846 – west, central, south India and Sri Lanka
* &quot;L. s. tricolor&quot; Hodgson, 1837 – Nepal and east India through Myanmar and south China to north Laos and north Thailand
* &quot;L. s. schach&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – central, southeast China to north Vietnam
* &quot;L. s. longicaudatus&quot; Ogilvie-Grant, 1902 – central, southeast Thailand and south Laos
* &quot;L. s. bentet&quot; Horsfield, 1821 – Malay Peninsula, Greater and Lesser Sundas and Borneo
* &quot;L. s. nasutus&quot; Scopoli, 1786 – Philippines (except Palawan group and Sulu Archipelago)
* &quot;L. s. suluensis&quot; (Mearns, 1905) – Sulu Archipelago (south Philippines)
* &quot;L. s. stresemanni&quot; Mertens, 1923 – montane east New Guinea

Stuart Baker in the second edition of &quot;The Fauna of British India&quot; considered &quot;Lanius schach&quot;, &quot;Lanius tephronotus&quot; and &quot;Lanius tricolor&quot; as three species. He considered &quot;nigriceps&quot; as synonymous with &quot;tricolor&quot; and included &quot;erythronotus&quot; as a race of &quot;schach&quot;. Other treatments were proposed by Hugh Whistler and N B Kinnear where &quot;tephronotus&quot; was considered a subspecies of &quot;schach&quot; and &quot;nigriceps&quot; and &quot;nasutus&quot; grouped together. Another treatment considered &quot;tricolor&quot; as a subspecies of &quot;L. tephronotus&quot;. It was subsequently however noted that &quot;tephronotus&quot; and &quot;schach&quot; co-occurred in the Kumaon region and so the two were confirmed as distinct species. Molecular distances also indicate that they are distant enough. The &quot;erythronotus&quot; group have a grey head which continues into the back with a gradual suffusion of rufous. The westernmost population from Transcaspia named by Sergei Buturlin as &quot;jaxartensis&quot; and said to be larger, is not considered valid. A very light grey form from western dry region of India named by Walter Koelz as &quot;kathiawarensis&quot; is also considered merely as a variant. In southern India and Sri Lanka, subspecies &quot;caniceps&quot;, is marked by the rufous restricted to the rump, light crown and the pure grey on the back. Biswamoy Biswas supported the view that &quot;nigriceps&quot; (having upper mantle grey and lower mantle rufous) was a hybrid of &quot;tricolor&quot; and &quot;erythronotus&quot;.

Subspecies &quot;longicaudatus&quot; has a greyer crown and is found in Thailand and Burma. The nominate subspecies is found in China from the Yangtze valley south to Hainan and Taiwan. Some individuals of the nominate form show melanism and were once described as a species &quot;fuscatus&quot;. Island forms include &quot;nasutus&quot; (Philippine Islands from Mindanao to Luzon and north Borneo), &quot;suluensis&quot; (Sulu Island), &quot;bentet&quot; (Sunda Islands and Sumatra other than Borneo) and &quot;stresemanni&quot; of New Guinea.

==Description==
The long-tailed shrike is a typical shrike, favouring dry open habitats and found perched prominently atop a bush or on a wire. The dark mask through the eye is broad and covers the forehead in most subspecies and the whole head is black in subspecies &quot;tricolor&quot; and &quot;nasutus&quot;. The tail is narrow and graduated with pale rufous on the outer feathers. Subspecies &quot;erythronotus&quot; has the grey of the mantle and upper back suffused with rufous while the southern Indian &quot;caniceps&quot; has pure grey. A small amount of white is present at the base of the primaries. The bay-backed shrike is smaller and more contrastingly patterned and has a more prominent white patch on the wing. The sexes are alike in plumage.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is found across Asia from Kazakhstan to New Guinea. It is found mainly in scrub and open habitats. Many of the temperate zone populations are migratory, moving south in winter while those in the tropics tend to be sedentary although they may make short distance movements. Subspecies &quot;caniceps&quot; of southern India is found in winter in the dry coastal zone of southern India. Subspecies &quot;tricolor&quot; migrates south to Bengal in India. They are found in scrub, grassland and open land under cultivation. A survey in southern India found them to be among the commonest wintering shrikes and found at a linear density along roadsides at about 0.58 per kilometer, often choosing wires to perch.

This species is a rare vagrant to western Europe on the strength of two accepted records in Great Britain on South Uist in November 2000 and the Netherlands near Den Helder in October 2011. A bird matching the features of &quot;caniceps&quot; was seen on the island of Maldives. It has also occurred as a vagrant to Jordan, Israel, Turkey,

==Behaviour and ecology==

This bird has a characteristic upright &quot;shrike&quot; attitude when perched on a bush, from which it glides down at an angle to take lizards, large insects, small birds and rodents. They maintain feeding territories and are usually found single or in pairs that are well spaced out. Several members have been observed indulging in play behaviour fighting over perches. The usual calls are harsh grating and scolding calls, likened to the squealing of a frog caught by a snake. They are capable of vocal mimicry and include the calls of many species including lapwings, cuckoos, puppies and squirrels in their song. This singing ability makes it a popular pet in parts of southeast Asia.

Long-tailed shrikes take a wide variety of animal prey. On occasion, they have been noted capturing fish from a stream. They also take small snakes. It sometimes indulges in kleptoparasitism and takes prey from other birds. It also captures flying insects in the air. They sometimes impale prey on a thorny bush after feeding just on the head or brain. They have been reported to feed on the fruits of the neem in Kerala, even attempting to impale them on a twig.

The breeding season is in summer in the temperate ranges. The nest is a deep and loose cup made up of thorny twigs, rags and hair. This is placed in a thorny bush, trees such as &quot;Flacourtia&quot; and wild date palms (&quot;Phoenix&quot;). The usual clutch is about 3 to 6 eggs which are incubated by both sexes. The eggs hatch after about 13 to 16 days. Young chicks are often fed with pieces of small birds captured by the parents. A second brood may be raised in the same nest. They are sometimes parasitized by cuckoos such as the common cuckoo (Dehra Dun), common hawk-cuckoo, Jacobin cuckoo and the Asian koel in Bangladesh.

<text>Helge Marcus Ingstad (30 December 1899 – 29 March 2001) was a Norwegian explorer. In 1960, after mapping some Norse settlements, Ingstad and his wife archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad found remnants of a Viking settlement in L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows in the province of Newfoundland in Canada. They were thus the first to prove conclusively that the Icelandic/Greenlandic Norsemen such as Leif Erickson had found a way across the Atlantic Ocean to North America, roughly 500 years before Christopher Columbus and John Cabot. He also thought that the mysterious disappearance of the Greenland Norse Settlements in the 14th and 15th centuries could be explained by their emigration to North America.

Helge Ingstad died at Diakonhjemmet Hospital in Oslo at the age of 101.

== Early life ==
Helge Ingstad was the son of Olav Ingstad (1867–1958) and Olga Marie Qvam (1869–1946) in Meråker Municipality in Nordre Trondheim county. His father was municipal engineer in Tromsø Municipality and held the title of factory supervisor. He was the grandson of lawyer professor, Marcus Pløen Ingstad. Helge and his family moved to Bergen in 1915 where he attended the Bergen Katedralskole (1915–1918), and after graduating cand. jur. in 1922 he took up a practice of lawyer in Levanger.

== Career ==
Helge Ingstad was originally a lawyer by profession, but, ever an outdoorsman, he sold his successful law practice in Levanger and went to Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories as a trapper in 1926. For the next three years, the Norwegian travelled with the local Indian tribe known as the Caribou Eaters. After returning to Norway, he wrote the bestselling &quot;Pelsjegerliv&quot; (&quot;Trapper Life&quot;) about his time in Canada, published in English as &quot;The Land of Feast and Famine&quot; (Knopf, 1933).

Ingstad was the governor (Sysselmann) of Erik the Red&#x27;s Land in 1932–1933, when Norway annexed that eastern part of Greenland. The Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague decided that the lands belonged to Denmark, and so the official Norwegian presence had to end. Following the verdict, Ingstad was summoned by the government to the job as governor of Svalbard (Spitsbergen and the surrounding islands) — a position suiting him uniquely, considering his profession of law and his experience in Arctic living.

== Marriage ==
During his years on Svalbard, Helge Ingstad met Anne Stine Moe, nearly twenty years his junior. She had read his books from Canada and Greenland with great admiration, and developed a crush on the explorer. She wrote to him, and after some time of correspondence and dating, they were engaged, and married in 1941. In 1946, the Ingstads made themselves a home near the Holmenkollen area of Norway&#x27;s capital, Oslo, where they spent the rest of their lives when not travelling the world. They had one daughter, Benedicte, who became a professor in medical anthropology at the University in Oslo. From her teenage years, Benedicte accompanied her parents on their exploration journeys.

== Author ==
Helge Ingstad was a popular author, whose books on his visits to remote parts of the world gained him fame in Norway. From Greenland he wrote &quot;Øst for den store bre&quot; (&quot;East of the Great Glacier&quot;), from Svalbard he wrote &quot;Landet med de kalde kyster&quot; (&quot;The Land With the Chilly Coasts&quot;). He also visited the Apache Indians of northwestern Mexico, from which he wrote &quot;Apache-indianerne - jakten på den tapte stamme&quot; (&quot;The Apaches - The Hunt for the Lost Tribe&quot;). After World War II he stayed for a period in the Brooks Range in northern Alaska among the Nunamiut Iñupiat, and afterwards wrote &quot;Nunamiut - blant Alaskas innlandseskimoer&quot; (&quot;Nunamiut - Inland Eskimos of Alaska&quot;).

His 1931 book, &quot;The Land of Feast or Famine&quot;, was republished by McGill University Press, in 1992, after being out of print for over forty years.

== Viking settlement of North America ==
In 1960, he discovered the remains of what later proved to be a Viking settlement at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows at the northernmost tip of Newfoundland in Canada.

It is the only known site of a Norse or Viking village in Canada, and in North America outside of Greenland. Dating to around the year 1000, L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows remains the only widely accepted instance of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact and is notable for its possible connection with the attempted colony of Vinland established by Leif Ericson around the same time period or, more broadly, with Norse exploration of the Americas.

Archaeological excavation at the site was conducted in the 1960s by an international team led by archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad (Helge Ingstad&#x27;s wife) and under the direction of Parks Canada of the Government of Canada in the 1970s. Following each period of excavation, the site was reburied to protect and conserve the cultural resources.
The settlement at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows has been dated to approximately 1,000 years ago, an assessment that tallies with the relative dating of artifact and structure types. The remains of eight buildings were located. They are believed to have been constructed of sod placed over a wooden frame. Based on associated artifacts, the buildings were variously identified as dwellings or workshops. The largest dwelling measured and consisted of several rooms. Workshops were identified as an iron smithy containing a forge and iron slag, a carpentry workshop, which generated wood debris, and a specialized boat repair area containing worn rivets. Besides those related to iron working, carpentry, and boat repair, other artifacts found at the site consisted of common everyday Norse items, including a stone oil lamp, a whetstone, a bronze fastening pin, a bone knitting needle, and part of a spindle. The presence of the spindle and needle suggests that women were present as well as men. Food remains included butternuts, which are significant because they do not grow naturally north of New Brunswick, and their presence probably indicates the Norse inhabitants travelled farther south to obtain them. Archaeologists concluded that the site was inhabited by the Norse for a relatively short period of time.

== Named features ==
Helge Ingstad has two geographic features in North America named after him. In Canada, a small river, Ingstad Creek, flows into Great Slave Lake. In Alaska, the high Ingstad Mountain in the Brooks Range was officially approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names on 19 April 2006. The name was suggested by the Nunamiut tribe in gratitude for Ingstad&#x27;s efforts on their behalf.

During the last few years of his life, he worked on categorizing and annotating the large quantity of photos and audio recordings (141 songs) he had made while living with the Nunamiut in 1950. The effort resulted in a booklet, &quot;Songs of the Nunamiut&quot;, with an accompanying CD containing the audio material. This is an extremely valuable contribution to the preservation of the Nunamiut culture, because it turned out that much of what he had gathered in the mid-20th century was now lost locally and was only preserved in his recordings.

== Honours ==
He was an honorary member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. He also held honorary doctorates at the University of Oslo, Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada, and at St. Olaf College in Minnesota. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav (in 1991; previously Knight 1st class in 1965, and Commander in 1970), Knight of the Order of Vasa, and he was presented with the Norwegian Red Cross Badge of Honour for his efforts in Finnmark during World War II. He received a lifetime government grant from the Norwegian government from 1970. He was the subject of a 1981 National Film Board of Canada (NFB) documentary &quot;The Man Who Discovered America&quot;, and subsequently appeared along with his wife in the 1984 NFB film, &quot;The Vinland Mystery&quot;. In 1986, he was presented Arts Council Norway&#x27;s honor award. , the fourth of the five s of the Royal Norwegian Navy was named after Helge Ingstad.

The inner main-belt asteroid 8993 Ingstad, discovered by Danish astronomer Richard Martin West at ESO&#x27;s La Silla Observatory in Chile in 1980, was named in his memory. The official naming citation was published by the MPC on 24 June 2002 ().

The Helge and Anne Stine Ingstad Building on the St. John&#x27;s Campus of Memorial University is named after him and his wife. It houses the University&#x27;s Print and Mail Services.

<doc id="204495" wikidata="Q785729" url="?curid=204495" title="Carolingian minuscule">
<text>Carolingian minuscule or Caroline minuscule is a script which developed as a calligraphic standard in the medieval European period so that the Latin alphabet of Jerome&#x27;s Vulgate Bible could be easily recognized by the literate class from one region to another. It is thought to have originated before 778 CE at the scriptorium of the Benedictine monks of Corbie Abbey, about north of Paris, and then developed by Alcuin of York for wide use in the Carolingian Renaissance. Alcuin himself still wrote in a script which was a precursor to the Carolingian minuscule, which slowly developed over three centuries. He was most likely responsible for copying and preserving the manuscripts and upkeep of the script. It was used in the Holy Roman Empire between approximately 800 and 1200. Codices, Christian texts, and educational material were written in Carolingian minuscule.

After blackletter developed out of it, the Carolingian minuscule became obsolete, until the 14th century Italian Renaissance, when the humanist minuscule script was also developed from it. By this latter line, the Carolingian minuscule is a direct ancestor of most modern-day Latin letter scripts and typefaces.

==Creation==
The script is derived from Roman half uncial and the insular scripts that were being used in Irish and English monasteries. The strong influence of Irish literati on the script can be seen in the distinctively (Irish style) forms of the letters, especially a, e, d, g, s, and t.

Carolingian minuscule was created partly under the patronage of the Emperor Charlemagne (hence Carolingian). Charlemagne had a keen interest in learning, according to his biographer Einhard (here with apices):

Temptábat et scríbere, tabulásque et códicellós ad hoc in lectó sub cervícálibus circumferre solébat, ut, cum vacuum tempus esset, manum litterís effigiendís adsuésceret, sed parum successit labor praeposterus ac séró incohátus.

This new script was significantly more legible than the scripts used by Romans or that of the script earlier in the Middle Ages, and offered new features such as word spacing, more punctuation, an introduction of lower-case letters, and conventions such as usage of upper-case for titles, a mix of upper and lower case for subtitles, and lower case for the body of a text. Although Charlemagne was never fully literate, he understood the value of literacy and a uniform script in running his empire. Charlemagne sent for the English scholar Alcuin of York to run his palace school and scriptorium at his capital, Aachen. Efforts to supplant Gallo-Roman and Germanic scripts had been under way before Alcuin arrived at Aachen, where he was master from 782 to 796, with a two-year break. The new minuscule was disseminated first from Aachen, of which the Ada Gospels provided classic models, and later from the influential scriptorium at Marmoutier Abbey (Tours), where Alcuin withdrew from court service as an abbot in 796 and restructured the scriptorium.

==Characteristics==
Carolingian minuscule was uniform with rounded shapes in clearly distinguishable glyphs, disciplined and above all, legible. Clear capital letters and spaces between words became standard in Carolingian minuscule, which was one result of a campaign to achieve a culturally unifying standardization across the Carolingian Empire.

Traditional charters, however, continued to be written in a Merovingian &quot;chancery hand&quot; long after manuscripts of Scripture and classical literature were being produced in the minuscule hand. Documents written in a local language, like Gothic or Anglo-Saxon rather than Latin, tended to be expressed in traditional local script.

Carolingian script generally has fewer ligatures than other contemporary scripts, although the &quot;et&quot; (&quot;&amp;&quot;), &quot;æ&quot;, &quot;rt&quot;, &quot;st&quot;, and &quot;ct&quot; ligatures are common. The letter &quot;d&quot; often appears in an uncial form with an ascender slanting to the left, but the letter &quot;g&quot; is essentially the same as the modern minuscule letter, rather than the previously common uncial &quot;ᵹ&quot;. Ascenders are usually &quot;clubbed&quot; – they become thicker near the top.

The early period of the script, during Charlemagne&#x27;s reign in the late 8th century and early 9th, still has widely varying letter forms in different regions. The uncial form of the letter &quot;a&quot;, similar to a double &quot;c&quot; (&quot;cc&quot;), was still used in manuscripts from this period. There was also use of punctuation such as the question mark, as in Beneventan script of the same period. The script flourished during the 9th century, when regional hands developed into an international standard, with less variation of letter forms. Modern glyphs, such as &quot;s&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, began to appear (as opposed to the &quot;long &quot;s&quot;&quot; &quot;ſ&quot; and &quot;u&quot;), and ascenders, after thickening at the top, were finished with a three-cornered wedge. The script began to evolve slowly after the 9th century. In the 10th and 11th centuries, ligatures were rare and ascenders began to slant to the right and were finished with a fork. The letter &quot;w&quot; also began to appear. By the 12th century, Carolingian letters had become more angular and were written closer together, less legibly than in previous centuries; at the same time, the modern dotted &quot;i&quot; appeared. 

==Spread==
The new script spread through Western Europe most widely where Carolingian influence was strongest. In luxuriously produced lectionaries that now began to be produced for princely patronage of abbots and bishops, legibility was essential. It reached far afield: the 10th century Freising manuscripts, which contain the oldest Slovene language, the first Roman-script record of any Slavic language, are written in Carolingian minuscule. In Switzerland, Carolingian was used in the Rhaetian and Alemannic minuscule types. Manuscripts written in Rhaetian minuscule tend to have slender letters, resembling Insular script, with the letters and , and ligatures such as , showing similar to Visigothic and Beneventan. Alemannic minuscule, used for a short time in the early 9th century, is usually larger, broader, and very vertical in comparison to the slanting Rhaetian type. It was developed by the monk Wolfcoz I at the Abbey of Saint Gall. In the Holy Roman Empire, Carolingian script flourished in Salzburg, Austria, as well as in Fulda, Mainz, and Würzburg, all of which were major centers of the script. German minuscule tends to be oval-shaped, very slender, and slanted to the right. It has uncial features as well, such as the ascender of the letter slanting to the left, and vertical initial strokes of and .

In northern Italy, the monastery at Bobbio used Carolingian minuscule beginning in the 9th century. Outside the sphere of influence of Charlemagne and his successors, however, the new legible hand was resisted by the Roman Curia; nevertheless the Romanesca type was developed in Rome after the 10th century. The script was not taken up in England and Ireland until ecclesiastic reforms in the middle of the 10th century; in Spain a traditionalist Visigothic hand survived; and in southern Italy a &#x27;Beneventan minuscule&#x27; survived in the lands of the Lombard duchy of Benevento through the 13th century, although Romanesca eventually also appeared in southern Italy.

==Role in cultural transmission==
Scholars during the Carolingian Renaissance sought out and copied in the new legible standardized hand many Roman texts that had been wholly forgotten. Most of contemporary knowledge of classical literature derives from copies made in the scriptoria of Charlemagne. Over 7000 manuscripts written in Carolingian script survive from the 8th and 9th centuries alone.

Though the Carolingian minuscule was superseded by Gothic blackletter hands, in retrospect, it seemed so thoroughly &#x27;classic&#x27; to the humanists of the early Renaissance that they took these old Carolingian manuscripts to be ancient Roman originals, and used them as bases for their Renaissance hand, the &quot;humanist minuscule&quot;. From there the script passed to the 15th- and 16th-century printers of books, such as Aldus Manutius of Venice. In this way it forms the basis of our modern lowercase typefaces. Indeed, &#x27;Carolingian minuscule&#x27; is a style of typeface, which approximates this historical hand, eliminating the nuances of size of capitals, long descenders, and so on.

<text>Michael Denzil Xavier Portillo ( ; born 26 May 1953) is a British journalist, broadcaster, and former Conservative Party politician. His broadcast series include railway documentaries such as &quot;Great British Railway Journeys&quot; and &quot;Great Continental Railway Journeys&quot;. A former member of the Conservative Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Enfield Southgate from 1984 to 1997 and Kensington and Chelsea from 1999 to 2005.

Portillo obtained a first-class degree in history from the University of Cambridge, having been a student at Peterhouse. He began his working life as a graduate trainee with the transport company Ocean Group plc, before joining the Conservative Research Department (CRD) in 1976. First elected to the House of Commons in a 1984 by-election, Portillo served as a junior minister under both Margaret Thatcher and John Major, before entering the Cabinet in 1992 as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. He was promoted to Secretary of State for Employment in 1994. A Thatcherite and a Eurosceptic, he was seen as a likely challenger to Major during the 1995 Conservative leadership election, but did not stand, and was subsequently promoted to Secretary of State for Defence. As Defence Secretary, he pressed for a course of &quot;clear blue water&quot;: purist policies separating the Conservatives from the Labour Party.

Portillo unexpectedly lost the theretofore safe Conservative Enfield Southgate seat at the 1997 general election. This led to the coining of the expression &quot;Portillo moment&quot;. Returning to the Commons in the 1999 by-election in Kensington and Chelsea, Portillo rejoined the frontbench as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. Standing for the leadership of the party in 2001, he came in third place behind Iain Duncan Smith and Kenneth Clarke. He retired from the House of Commons and from active politics at the 2005 general election.

Since leaving politics, Portillo has pursued his media interests by presenting and participating in a wide range of television and radio programmes. Portillo&#x27;s passion for steam trains led him to make the BBC documentary series &quot;Great British Railway Journeys&quot;, beginning in 2010, in which he travels the British railway networks, referring to various editions of &quot;Bradshaw&#x27;s Guide.&quot; The success of the show led Portillo to present series about railway systems in other countries. In 2022 he began to present a political show &quot;Portillo&quot; for the British news channel GB News.

==Early life==

Portillo was born in Bushey, Hertfordshire, on 26 May 1953 to an exiled Spanish republican father, Luis Gabriel Portillo (1907–1993) and a Scottish mother, Cora Waldegrave de Portillo (&quot;&quot; Blyth; 1919–2014). Portillo&#x27;s father, a devout Catholic, was a member of left-wing movements in the 1930s and fled Madrid when it fell to General Franco in 1939, settling in England. He became head of the London Diplomatic Office of the Government in Exile in 1972. Portillo&#x27;s maternal grandfather, John Waldegrave Blyth (1873–1962), was a prosperous linen manufacturer from Kirkcaldy, who left an art collection worth millions to the Kirkcaldy Galleries.

Portillo was registered as a Spanish citizen at the age of four, and in accordance with Spanish naming customs (which require a person to have two surnames) his Spanish passport names him as Miguel Portillo Blyth. Portillo&#x27;s now well-known &quot;love affair with trains&quot; started when he was a youth. He owned a clockwork train set, and envied friends who had electric ones. Additionally, his mother took him on 13-hour trips from London to Kirkcaldy aboard a steam-hauled night train, the &quot;Starlight Special&quot;, to visit his British grandparents, and he had summer holidays on the Isle of Wight, where he &quot;loved&quot; the steam railway between Ryde and Ventnor.

In 1961, aged 8, Portillo appeared in a television advertisement for Ribena, a blackcurrant cordial drink. He was educated at Stanburn Primary School in Stanmore, Greater London, and Harrow County School for Boys and was awarded a scholarship to Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he studied history. While at school Portillo had supported the cause of the Labour Party; he attributed his embrace of conservatism at Cambridge to the influence of the right-wing Peterhouse historian Maurice Cowling. In 1982, Portillo married Carolyn Claire Eadie.

==Political career (1984–2005)==

Portillo graduated in 1975 with a first-class degree in history, and, after a brief stint with Ocean Transport and Trading Ltd., a shipping and transport company, he joined the Conservative Research Department in 1976. Following the Conservative victory in 1979, he became a government adviser to David Howell at the Department of Energy. He left to work for Kerr-McGee Oil between 1981 and 1983. In the 1983 general election, he fought his first electoral contest, in the Labour-held seat of Birmingham Perry Barr, losing to the incumbent Jeff Rooker.

===Election===

Portillo returned to advisory work for the government, and, in December 1984, he stood for and won the Enfield Southgate by-election, following the death of the incumbent, Sir Anthony Berry, in the bombing of the Grand Hotel, Brighton by the IRA. Initially, he was a Parliamentary Private Secretary to John Moore, and then an assistant whip.

===In government===

In 1987, Portillo was given his first ministerial post, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security; the following year, he was promoted to Minister of State for Transport. Portillo has stated that he considers &quot;saving the Settle to Carlisle railway&quot; to be his greatest achievement. He was a strong supporter of Margaret Thatcher.

In 1990, Portillo was appointed Minister of State for Local Government, in which post he argued in favour of the ultimately highly unpopular Community Charge system (popularly known as &quot;the Poll Tax&quot;). He demonstrated a consistently right-of-centre line (exemplified by his insistence, in a well-publicised speech, on placing &quot;clear blue water&quot; between the policies of the Conservatives and other parties) and was favoured by Norman Tebbit and Margaret Thatcher, who said of him &quot;[W]e expect great things of you, do not disappoint us&quot;. His rise continued under John Major; he was made a Cabinet Minister in 1992 as Chief Secretary to the Treasury and was admitted to the Privy Council the same year. He subsequently became Secretary of State for Employment (1994–95), and then Secretary of State for Defence (1995–1997).
As Defence Secretary, Portillo became the object of criticism when he invoked the motto of the SAS, &quot;Who Dares, Wins&quot;, at a speech at the 1995 Conservative Party annual conference. In 1996 his ministry undertook the sale of the entire stock of Ministry of Defence (MoD) housing for military personnel to Annington Homes. His high profile led to constant attention from the media, including &quot;Private Eye&quot;, which mockingly referred to him as &quot;Portaloo&quot;. He was accused of vanity when Alexandra Palace was hired to celebrate his ten years in politics.

Some saw the Defence Secretary post as a reward for Portillo&#x27;s cautious loyalty to Major during the 1995 leadership challenge of John Redwood, following Major&#x27;s &quot;back me or sack me&quot; resignation as party leader. Many urged Portillo, the &quot;darling of the right&quot;, to run against Major. He declined to enter the first round, but planned to challenge Major if the contest went to a second round. To this end, he set up a potential campaign headquarters, with banks of telephone lines. He later admitted that this had been an error: &quot;I did not want to oppose [Major], but neither did I want to close the possibility of entering a second ballot if it came to that.&quot; Portillo acknowledged that &quot;ambiguity is unattractive&quot; and his opponents within the party later used Portillo&#x27;s apparent equivocation as an example of his indecisiveness; &quot;I appeared happy to wound but afraid to strike: a dishonourable position.&quot;

===1997 election defeat===

Portillo&#x27;s loss of the Enfield Southgate seat, in the 1997 general election to Labour&#x27;s Stephen Twigg, came as a shock to many politicians and commentators, and came to symbolise the extent of the Labour landslide victory. Halfway through the campaign, Portillo invited aides Andrew Cooper and Michael Simmonds to his house and presented them with some ideas for a leadership campaign following the expected Conservative defeat and asked them to finish it off. However, when a poll in &quot;The Observer&quot; on the weekend before the election showed that Portillo held only a three-point lead in his hitherto-safe seat, Portillo asked Cooper, who oversaw the party&#x27;s internal polling, to reassure him that it was wrong; Cooper was unable to and Portillo began to think that he might lose.

He was interviewed by Jeremy Paxman on election night, prior to the result being called in his own seat. Paxman opened the interview with the question &quot;so Michael, are you going to miss the limo?&quot;—a reference to the expectation that the Conservatives were headed for defeat and thus he would no longer be a Minister. Portillo was then asked &quot;are we seeing the end of the Conservative Party as a credible force in British politics?&quot;. He has since revealed that, prior to the interview, he had already come to believe he had lost his seat:

Portillo&#x27;s defeat represented a 17.4% swing to Labour. Symbolising the loss of the election by the Conservative Party, it has been referred to as &quot;the Portillo moment&quot;, and in the cliché &quot;Were you up for Portillo?&quot; (i.e., &quot;Were you awake/did you see Portillo&#x27;s result announced on television?&quot;) In 2010, Portillo wrote: &quot;I had hoped for something better than &quot;Were You Still Up for Portillo?&quot; Now I feel lucky to have been ejected. I discovered that there is life and livelihood outside Westminster.&quot;

===Return to Parliament===

Following the election, Portillo renewed his attachment to Kerr-McGee, but also undertook substantial media work, including programmes for the BBC and Channel 4. In an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; given in 1999, Portillo said that &quot;I had some homosexual experiences as a young person.&quot; A few weeks after he had given that interview, the death of Alan Clark gave Portillo the opportunity to return to Parliament, despite Lord Tebbit accusing Portillo of lying about the extent of his sexual &quot;deviance&quot;, and similar comments from an associate included in a profile of Portillo in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. He comfortably won the by-election in late November 1999 to represent Kensington and Chelsea, traditionally one of the safest Conservative seats.

On 1 February 2000, William Hague promoted Portillo to the Shadow cabinet as Deputy Leader and Shadow Chancellor. On 3 February, Portillo stood opposite the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, in the House of Commons for the first time in his new role. During this session, Portillo declared that a future Conservative government would enhance the independence of the Bank of England and increase its accountability to Parliament, and that it would not repeal the national minimum wage.

===2001 leadership election===

Following the 2001 general election, Portillo contested the leadership of the party. In the first ballot of Conservative MPs, he led well. However, there followed press stories, including references to his previous homosexual experiences and to his equivocation at the time of Major&#x27;s 1995 resignation. He was knocked out in the final round of voting by Conservative MPs, his sexual history – according to Kenneth Clarke – having damaged his chances, leaving party members to choose between Iain Duncan Smith and Kenneth Clarke.

Portillo&#x27;s supporters became known as &quot;Portillistas&quot;.

===Retirement from politics===

When Duncan Smith was elected leader, Portillo returned to the backbenches. In March 2003, he voted in favour of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In November 2003, he turned down an offer of a Shadow Cabinet post from the incoming Conservative leader Michael Howard. He did not seek re-election in the 2005 general election. His membership of the Conservative Party has since lapsed.

In 2007 he was named by PinkNews as one of the most powerful LGBT+ figures in British politics.

Talking to Andrew Neil on &quot;This Week&quot; in May 2016, he gave his views on the effectiveness of David Cameron&#x27;s government and its legislative plans as described in the Queen&#x27;s speech: &quot;After 23 years of careful thought about what they would like to do in power ... the answer is nothing&quot;, a description which &quot;The Guardian&quot; described as &quot;elegant&quot;.

Portillo supported Brexit, though he also expressed the opinion that the 2016 Brexit referendum &quot;absolutely does not fit with&quot; the British system of parliamentary sovereignty, and that &quot;parliament has the right to interpret&quot; the result. In a 2016 television discussion he said that &quot;because of the catastrophic blunder committed by David Cameron, [Nigel] Farage deserves a place in history&quot; because &quot;he spooked the Prime Minister into holding a referendum that he then lost.&quot; He also condemned Theresa May&#x27;s 2018 &quot;Chequers plan&quot; for exit negotiations as &quot;the most dreadful betrayal, and if I had been a member of the Cabinet, I would have been one of the ones who would have quit over the weekend.&quot;

==Business interests==

In September 2002, Portillo became a non-executive director of the multinational defence contractor BAE Systems. He stepped down from that position in March 2006, owing to potential conflicts of interest. He was a member of the board of the Kerr-McGee Corporation for a few months in 2006.

==Broadcasting career (1998–present)==

===Television===

1998 saw Portillo make his first foray into broadcasting on Channel 4 with &quot;Portillo&#x27;s Progress&quot;—three 60-minute-long programmes looking into the changed social and political scene in Britain. From 2002 onwards, Portillo developed an active career in media, both as a commentator on public affairs and as a writer and/or presenter of television and radio documentaries. Between its inception in 2003 and cancellation in 2019, Portillo appeared in the BBC weekly political discussion programme &quot;This Week&quot; with Andrew Neil, and, until September 2010, Labour MP Diane Abbott.

Portillo has featured in a number of television documentaries. including one in Spain: &quot;Great Railway Journeys: From Granada to Salamanca&quot;, for BBC Two (1999) and one about Richard Wagner. In 2006 he made a programme on Spanish wildlife for BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;The Natural World&quot; series. For an episode of the 2003 BBC Two series &quot;My Week In The Real World&quot;, in which politicians stepped into the shoes of members of the public, Portillo took over, for one week, the life, family and income of a single mother living on benefits in Wallasey.

He chose to present Queen Elizabeth I for the BBC&#x27;s series of &quot;Great Britons&quot; in 2002. In 2005 he presented the lavish BBC documentary re-telling of the story of Lord Nelson, &quot;Nelson&#x27;s Trafalgar&quot; (2005). Between 2002 and 2007, he presented a discussion series called &quot;Dinner with Portillo&quot; on BBC Four, in which political and social questions were explored by Portillo and his seven guests over a four-course meal. His guests included Bianca Jagger, Grayson Perry, Francis Wheen, Seymour Hersh, PD James, Baroness Williams, George Galloway, Benazir Bhutto and Germaine Greer. In 2007, he participated in the BBC television project &quot;The Verdict&quot;, serving, with other well known figures, as a jury member hearing a fictional rape case. He was elected as the jury&#x27;s foreman.

The documentary &quot;How To Kill a Human Being&quot; in the &quot;Horizon&quot; series featured Portillo carrying out a survey of capital punishment methods (including undertaking some near death experiences himself), in an attempt to find an &#x27;acceptable&#x27; form of capital punishment. It was broadcast on BBC Two on 15 January 2008. He made a second &quot;Horizon&quot; documentary, titled &quot;How Violent Are You?&quot;, broadcast on 12 May 2009. In 2008, Portillo made a documentary as part of the BBC &quot;Headroom&quot; campaign, which explored mental health issues. Portillo&#x27;s documentary &quot;Michael Portillo: Death of a School Friend&quot; explores how the suicide of Portillo&#x27;s classmate Gary Findon affected Findon&#x27;s parents, brother, music teachers, schoolteachers, classmates, and Portillo himself. The programme was originally broadcast on 7 November 2008.

In 2009, he filmed a series titled &quot;Great British Railway Journeys&quot;, in which he explored, with the aid of George Bradshaw&#x27;s 1863 tourist handbook, how the railways had a profound influence on the social, economic and political history of Britain. The series commenced broadcasting in January 2010. A second series was broadcast on BBC Two in 2011, and as of May 2021, there have been a total of thirteen series. He also presented a similar television series, &quot;Great Continental Railway Journeys&quot;, which followed Portillo around continental Europe. A second series was broadcast in 2013, and to date there has been a total of six series. In 2014, as part of the BBC&#x27;s World War I commemorations, Portillo presented &quot;Railways of the Great War with Michael Portillo&quot; over five nights in August 2014. 

In early 2016, Portillo began a new BBC travel documentary series &quot;Great American Railroad Journeys&quot;, which saw him travelling across the United States by rail. Other similar series followed: &quot;Great Indian Railway Journeys&quot; from 2018 and &quot;Great Alaskan and Canadian Railroad Journeys&quot;, which started airing in January 2019. A series &quot;Great Australian Railway Journeys&quot; began airing on BBC2 on 26 October 2019, with six journeys across Australia. This was followed by a series &quot;Great Asian Railway Journeys&quot; from 27 January 2020, and &quot;Great Coastal Railway Journeys&quot; (BBC2, JanuaryMay 2024).

In 2020, as part of his &quot;Great Continental Railway Journeys&quot;, in the &quot;Salamanca to Canfranc&quot;, while in Salamanca, Portillo was given access to papers about his father held at the General Archive of the Spanish Civil War.

<text>Sean Leland Sebastian Gullette (born June 4, 1968) is an American film director, writer, screenwriter, actor, and producer.

== Film directing ==

Gullette is slated to direct &quot;Upland&quot;, adapted from the novel &quot;Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids&quot; by Nobel Prize–winning Japanese author Kenzaburō Ōe, for an upcoming international co-production. Attached cast include Forrest Goodluck and Paul Sparks with Lisa Wolofsky and Pierre Even as lead producers.

Gullette&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;Traitors&quot;, starring Chaimae Ben Acha, Soufia Issami, Mourade Zeguindi, Driss Roukhe and Saleh Bensaleh was released internationally. The film was shot on locations in Tangier, Morocco and the hashish producing Rif mountains. It made its world premiere at the 2013 Venice Film Festival, and screened in competition at the Stockholm Film Festival and at the Marrakech International Film Festival, the Dubai Film Festival, and the Tribeca Film Festival. The film was distributed by Rezo Films, Paris and in the US by Film Movement. &quot;Traitors&quot; received positive reviews from critics and has a &quot;Fresh&quot; rating of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes. &quot;To keep her parents from being evicted and fund her Clash-inspired punk band, Malika takes a job smuggling drugs over the mountains. Her partner in the run is a world-weary veteran drug mule, who unexpectedly wins Malika&#x27;s sympathy.&quot;

Gullette was announced at the Cannes Film Festival as the writer-director of &quot;Tangier&quot;, a film in-development set to star Kristin Scott Thomas and Jeremy Irons. The status of the project is currently unknown.

==Producing ==
Gullette executive produced the landmark doc series &quot;Black Gold&quot; with Protozoa Pictures and TIME Studios. &quot;BLACK GOLD is the story of the coverup of the century - of the boss atop a trillion-dollar industry who discovered a shocking truth 40 years ago, created a black ops conspiracy to hide the evidence, and would stop at nothing to keep the money flowing, while the world burned...&quot;

Gullette produced &quot;The 8&quot; with Sarah Riggs and Blaire Dessent; the film was selected for the 2010 Berlin Film Festival. He directed several short films from his own scripts. He produced &quot;False Start&quot; by Yto Barrada which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival and went on to win a Tiger Award at the 2016 Rotterdam Film Festival and &quot;Tree Identification for Beginners&quot; also by Barrada which premiered at Rotterdam 2018.

Gullette produced Nicole Zaray&#x27;s gender-inverted short film &quot;Joe&#x27;s Day&quot;, featuring Deborah Harry. He wrote produced &quot;Thanksgiving&quot;, starring Yolonda Ross, James Urbaniak and Seymour Cassel.

==Screenwriting ==
His feature film screenwriting projects have included &quot;Trinity&quot;, &quot;Conviction&quot;, &quot;Monopolis&quot; and &quot;Kilroy&quot;. He wrote &quot;New York Stories&quot; for Donna Karan&#x27;s DKNY, and directed the &quot;Von Hummer the 1st&quot; series of promotional spots for VH1, starring James Urbaniak. He has also consulted on screenplays for Warner Bros., Paramount, and independent productions. IMDB reports Gullette as the screenwriter of the upcoming Olivier Megaton film &quot;Land of the Living&quot;.

==Television==

In 2019, Gullette directed two episodes of the ABC Television series &quot;1969&quot;. Gullette wrote that &quot;Was quite an adventure to direct this hour for ABC TV, which aired in the spring and is now streaming. Thanks to EP Jeanmarie Condon, my segment producers Jesse Rosen and Jackie Filer, senior producer Erica Salit, editors Doug Quade and Alessandro Barnett and the team at Lincoln Square Productions. Despite the title, everyone signed on to resist the grotesque Manson Industry and instead listen closely to the stories of two fascinating — and very different — women who joined the group. Both Dianne Lake and Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme sat for powerful, revealing interviews. Our re-reading of the Manson myth is also carried by Peter Fonda, rock author Lizzy Goodman, VIBE editor Desiree Thompson, Woodstock founder Michael Lang, John Fogerty of Creedence, and Tariq Trotter of The Roots.&quot;

==Acting==
His professional work in film began in 1998, when he co-wrote and played the lead role in the award-winning &quot;Pi&quot;, directed by longtime collaborator Darren Aronofsky. He has since played principal and supporting roles in some twenty films including Brad Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Happy Accidents&quot; (with Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio and Marisa Tomei) and Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; (with Jennifer Connelly), the German film &quot;Toskana Karrussel&quot; (with Susanna Lothar) and as a guest actor on network TV dramas. His occasional theater work has included the lead in the New York premiere of Susan Sandler&#x27;s &quot;If I Were a Train&quot;.

In 2010 he played principal roles in &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;, directed by Vincent Sweeney, and &quot;Die zwei Leben des Daniel Shore&quot;, with Nikolai Kinski and Morjana Alaoui, directed by Michael Dreher.

In 2015 he played supporting roles in the film &quot;Zanj Revolution&quot;, by Tariq Teguia and in 2013 &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; by Laila Marrakshi.

Gullette performs spoken word pieces on the songs &quot;Song of Alice&quot; from Israeli-French singer Keren Ann&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Nolita&quot; on Blue Note/Capitol/EMI Records and on Northern Irish DJ and musician David Holmes&#x27;s album &quot;Bow Down to the Exit Sign&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gullette was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Margaret Morganroth Gullette, a cultural critic and writer, and David George Gullette, a professor of English. He attended public schools and Harvard, where he acted in theater and films and directed plays.

Gullette lives between New York City and Tangier, Morocco, and in addition to his film work is the founder of the 212 Society, a US non-profit which supports cultural and educational projects in Morocco, including the Cinémathèque de Tanger and Darna. The 212 Society takes its name from the 212 telephone codes of its home city and adoptive country.

Gullette and artist Yto Barrada are married and have two daughters, Vega Violet Alia and Tamo Jasmin Ada.

==Other writing==
Gullette&#x27;s essays, journalism and fiction have been published in magazines including &quot;The Face&quot;, &quot;Spy&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;Bidoun&quot;, &quot;Brill&#x27;s Content&quot;, &quot;Gear&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Nejma&quot;, and &quot;KGB&quot; magazine (which he founded as editor and publisher in 1991.) His essay &quot;Mile High&quot; appears in the NYU Press&#x27; book &quot;110 Stories: New York Writes After September 11&quot;, and his essay &quot;Notes&quot; appears in the Springer-Verlag anthology &quot;Art, Technology, and Cinema.&quot; Gullette has ghostwritten for visual artists, and edited texts for the walls and publications of MoMA, the Whitney Biennial, the Tate Modern, and the Centre Pompidou, Paris.

<text>A millennium () is a period of one thousand years, one hundred decades, or ten centuries, sometimes called a [[Millennium|kiloannum]] (ka), or kiloyear (ky). Normally, the word is used specifically for periods of a thousand years that begin at the starting point (initial reference point) of the calendar in consideration and at later years that are whole number multiples of a thousand years after the start point. The term can also refer to an interval of time beginning on any date. Millennia sometimes have religious or theological implications (see millenarianism).

The word &quot;millennium&quot; derives from the Latin &#x27;, &quot;thousand&quot;, and&#x27;, year.

==Debate over millennium celebrations==

There was a public debate leading up to the celebrations of the year 2000 as to whether the beginning of that year should be understood as the beginning of the &quot;new&quot; millennium. Historically, there has been debate around the turn of previous decades, centuries, and millennia, but not so much for decades. The issue arises from the difference between the convention of using ordinal numbers to count years and millennia, as in &quot;the third millennium&quot;, or using a vernacular description, as in &quot;the two thousands&quot;. The difference of opinion comes down to whether to celebrate, respectively, the end or the beginning of the &quot;-000&quot; year. The first convention is common in English-speaking countries, but the latter is favoured in, for example, Sweden (&quot;tvåtusentalet&quot;, which translates literally as the &quot;two thousands period&quot;).

Those holding that the arrival of the new millennium should be celebrated in the transition from 2000 to 2001 (i.e., December 31, 2000, to January 1, 2001) argued that the &quot;Anno Domini&quot; system of counting years began with the year 1 (there was no year 0) and therefore the first millennium was from the year 1 to the end of the year 1000, the second millennium from 1001 to the end of 2000, and the third millennium beginning with 2001 and ending at the end of 3000. Similarly, the first millennium BC was from the year 1000 BC to the end of the year 1 BC.

Popular culture supported celebrating the arrival of the new millennium in the transition from 1999 to 2000 (i.e., December 31, 1999, to January 1, 2000), in that the change of the hundreds digit in the year number, with the zeroes rolling over, is consistent with the vernacular demarcation of decades by their &#x27;tens&#x27; digit (e.g. naming the period 1980 to 1989 as &quot;the 1980s&quot; or &quot;the eighties&quot;). This has been described as &quot;the odometer effect&quot;. Also, the &quot;year 2000&quot; had been a popular phrase referring to an often utopian future, or a year when stories in such a future were set. There was also media and public interest in the Y2K computer bug.

A third position was expressed by Bill Paupe, honorary consul for Kiribati: &quot;To me, I just don&#x27;t see what all the hoopla is about ... it&#x27;s not going to change anything. The next day the sun is going to come up again and then it will all be forgotten.&quot; Even for those who did celebrate, in astronomical terms, there was nothing special about this particular event.

Stephen Jay Gould, in his essay &quot;Dousing Diminutive Dennis&#x27; Debate (or DDDD = 2000)&quot;, discussed the &quot;high&quot; versus &quot;pop&quot; culture interpretation of the transition. Gould noted that the high culture, strict construction had been the dominant viewpoint at the 20th century&#x27;s beginning, but that the pop culture viewpoint dominated at its end.

The start of the 21st century and 3rd millennium was celebrated worldwide at the start of the year 2000. One year later, at the start of the year 2001, the celebrations had largely returned to the usual ringing in of just another new year, although some welcomed &quot;the real millennium&quot;, including America&#x27;s official timekeeper, the U.S. Naval Observatory, and the countries of Cuba and Japan.

The popular approach was to treat the end of 1999 as the end of &quot;a millennium&quot; and to hold millennium celebrations at midnight between December 31, 1999, and January 1, 2000, with the cultural and psychological significance of the events listed above combining to cause celebrations to be observed one year earlier than the formal date.

<doc id="204506" wikidata="Q2108454" url="?curid=204506" title="List of birds of Europe">
<text>More than 900 species of birds have been observed in Europe. The avifauna of Europe is broadly similar to that of Asia north of the Himalayas and North Africa, both of which also belong to the Palearctic realm. There are also many groups shared with North America. On the other hand, many groups characteristic of the Afrotropical and Indomalayan realms are entirely absent from Europe, including jacanas, darters, trogons, hornbills, honeyguides, barbets (families Lybiidae in Africa and Megalaimidae in Asia), parrots, pittas, cuckooshrikes, broadbills (families Calyptomenidae and Eurylaimidae), drongos, monarch flycatchers, white-eyes, and estrildid finches (although parrots and estrildid finches have been introduced to Europe by humans).

Two species that occurred in the European region until recently (post 1800) — the great auk and the Canary Islands oystercatcher — are now globally extinct, while one additional species — the slender-billed curlew — may also be extinct. In addition, the common buttonquail has been extirpated from Europe, but survives in Africa and Asia. 71 bird species are considered threatened in Europe.

The following tags have been used to indicate the status of species in Europe. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories.

* (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Europe
* (E) Endemic - a species endemic to Europe
* (Ext) Extinct - a species that no longer exists
* (Ex) Extirpated - a species that is extinct in the wild in Europe
* (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Europe as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions

The taxonomic order follows the &quot;IOC World Bird List&quot; version 13.1.

==Definition of Europe==

This article follows a common definition of Europe as being bounded to the south by the Mediterranean Sea, to the east and north-east by the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, and the Caspian Sea, and to the south-east by the Caucasus Mountains, the Black Sea, and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. Iceland and Svalbard are included, but Greenland is not. Mediterranean islands are generally included, except for Cyprus and those islands belonging to Turkey or countries of North Africa or the Middle East. The Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands belong politically to Europe, but definitions based on geography or avifauna assign these islands variously to Europe, Africa, or neither of the two. Here, birds that are endemic to these islands, or have been observed only on these islands but not elsewhere in Europe, are labelled accordingly. The same approach is applied to birds occurring only in the Caucasus, which is commonly seen as straddling the border between Europe and Asia. The birds of Cape Verde are not included in this list. Oceans are included up to the limit of 200 nautical miles from the European coastline, or half the distance to Africa, whichever is lesser.

For countries or territories lying wholly within Europe as defined above, species are included in this list if they are classified as Category A, B, or C (or the nearest equivalent) on the relevant national list. For countries that straddle Europe and Asia (in particular Russia and Turkey), the precise location of sightings within that country is determinative.

==Ducks, geese, and swans==
Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae

The swans, ducks and geese are medium to large birds that are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet and bills which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent. In many ducks the male is colourful while the female is dull brown. The diet consists of a variety of animals and plants. The family is well represented in Europe with many introduced species as well.

<doc id="204509" wikidata="Q625163" url="?curid=204509" title="Hafiz (Quran)">
<text>Hafiz (; , pl. &quot;ḥuffāẓ&quot; , f. &quot;ḥāfiẓa&quot; ), depending on the context, is a term used by Muslims for someone who has completely memorized the Quran which consists of 77,797 words in the original Classical Arabic. Hafiza is the female equivalent.

A hafiz is given great respect by the people of the community with titles such as &quot;Hafiz Sahb&quot; (Sir Hafiz), &quot;Ustadh&quot; (أُسْتَاذ) (Teacher), and occasionally Sheikh (شَيْخ).

== Importance ==
&quot;Hifz&quot; is the memorization of the Quran. Hufaz is when Muslims believe that whoever memorizes the whole Quran and acts upon it will be rewarded and honoured greatly by Allah, as Abdullah ibn Amr narrated that the Messenger of Allah said: &quot;It shall be meaning to the one who memorized the &#x27;Recite, and rise up, recite (melodiously) as you would recite in the world. Indeed your rank shall be at the last Āyah you recited&quot; (Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2914)

Having memorized the Quran, the &quot;hafiz&quot; or &quot;hafiza&quot; or &quot;hufaz&quot; must then ensure they do not forget it. Ensuring perfect recall of all the learned verses requires constant practice. The memorization of the Quran was important to Muslims in the past and also in the present. Yearly, thousands of students master the Quran and complete the book with interpretation and also memorization.

In Pakistan alone, Qari Hanif Jalandhari, the general secretary of the Wafaq-ul-Madaris, which is a central board accounting for most of the religious seminaries in Pakistan adhering to Deobandi sect, says that, in its network of madaris, &quot;one million children have become Hafiz-e-Quran after an exam was introduced in 1982&quot;, with more than 78,000 (including 14,000 girls) every year, which he compared to the yearly output of Saudi Arabia, which is 5,000.

== Cultural differences ==
For Muslims who are attempting to memorize certain surah but are unfamiliar with the Arabic script, the ulema have made various elucidations. There are mixed opinions on the usage of romanization of Arabic due to concerns about mispronunciations, higher approval of writing systems with close consonantal and vocalic equivalents to classical Arabic or relevant and effective diacritics, and a preference for Quran tutors or recorded recitations from qurrāʾ or any device with clear audible sound storage technology, such as CDs or cassettes.

Keeping the Quran memorized has always been a challenging and, at the same time, an important issue in Muslim countries. In Iran, according to Resolution 573 of the Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution, there is at least one specialized examination of the preservation of the Quran each year, according to specific criteria. The reviewer of this evaluation is Dar al-Qur&#x27;an al-Karim, a subsidiary of the Islamic Advertising Organization. According to Article 5 of the above Decree, holders of specialized qualifications for memorizing the Quran will enjoy the benefits of one to five art degrees, subject to the approval of the 547th session of the Supreme Council for Cultural Revolution. Therefore, the approval of the Qualification Degrees 1 to 5 of the Quran is in line with the Doctoral, Master&#x27;s, Bachelor, Associate&#x27;s Diploma, and Diploma degrees, respectively.

<text>Philosophical skepticism (UK spelling: scepticism; from Greek σκέψις &quot;skepsis&quot;, &quot;inquiry&quot;) is a family of philosophical views that question the possibility of knowledge. It differs from other forms of skepticism in that it even rejects very plausible knowledge claims that belong to basic common sense. Philosophical skeptics are often classified into two general categories: Those who deny all possibility of knowledge, and those who advocate for the suspension of judgment due to the inadequacy of evidence. This distinction is modeled after the differences between the Academic skeptics and the Pyrrhonian skeptics in ancient Greek philosophy. Pyrrhonian skepticism is a practice of suspending judgement, and skepticism in this sense is understood as a way of life that helps the practitioner achieve inner peace. Some types of philosophical skepticism reject all forms of knowledge while others limit this rejection to certain fields, for example, knowledge about moral doctrines or about the external world. Some theorists criticize philosophical skepticism based on the claim that it is a self-refuting idea since its proponents seem to claim to &quot;know&quot; that there is no knowledge. Other objections focus on its implausibility and distance from regular life.

==Overview==

Philosophical skepticism is a doubtful attitude toward commonly accepted knowledge claims. It is an important form of skepticism. Skepticism in general is a questioning attitude toward all kinds of knowledge claims. In this wide sense, it is quite common in everyday life: many people are ordinary skeptics about parapsychology or about astrology because they doubt the claims made by proponents of these fields. But the same people are not skeptical about other knowledge claims like the ones found in regular school books. Philosophical skepticism differs from ordinary skepticism in that it even rejects knowledge claims that belong to basic common sense and seem to be very certain. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as &quot;radical doubt&quot;. In some cases, it is even proclaimed that one does not know that &quot;I have two hands&quot; or that &quot;the sun will come out tomorrow&quot;. In this regard, philosophical skepticism is not a position commonly adopted by regular people in everyday life. This denial of knowledge is usually associated with the demand that one should suspend one&#x27;s beliefs about the doubted proposition. This means that one should neither believe nor disbelieve it but keep an open mind without committing oneself one way or the other. Philosophical skepticism is often based on the idea that no matter how certain one is about a given belief, one could still be wrong about it. From this observation, it is argued that the belief does not amount to knowledge. Philosophical skepticism follows from the consideration that this might be the case for most or all beliefs. Because of its wide-ranging consequences, it is of central interest to theories of knowledge since it questions their very foundations.

According to some definitions, philosophical skepticism is not just the rejection of some forms of commonly accepted knowledge but the rejection of all forms of knowledge. In this regard, we may have relatively secure beliefs in some cases but these beliefs never amount to knowledge. Weaker forms of philosophical skepticism restrict this rejection to specific fields, like the external world or moral doctrines. In some cases, knowledge per se is not rejected but it is still denied that one can ever be absolutely certain.

There are only few defenders of philosophical skepticism in the strong sense. In this regard, it is much more commonly used as a theoretical tool to test theories. On this view, it is a philosophical methodology that can be utilized to probe a theory to find its weak points, either to expose it or to modify it in order to arrive at a better version of it. However, some theorists distinguish philosophical skepticism from methodological skepticism in that philosophical skepticism is an approach that questions the possibility of certainty in knowledge, whereas methodological skepticism is an approach that subjects all knowledge claims to scrutiny with the goal of sorting out true from false claims. Similarly, scientific skepticism differs from philosophical skepticism in that scientific skepticism is an epistemological position in which one questions the veracity of claims lacking empirical evidence. In practice, the term most commonly references the examination of claims and theories that appear to be pseudoscience, rather than the routine discussions and challenges among scientists.

In ancient philosophy, skepticism was seen not just as a theory about the existence of knowledge but as a way of life. This outlook is motivated by the idea that suspending one&#x27;s judgment on all kinds of issues brings with it inner peace and thereby contributes to the skeptic&#x27;s happiness.

=== Classification ===
Skepticism can be classified according to its scope. Local skepticism involves being skeptical about particular areas of knowledge (e.g. moral skepticism, skepticism about the external world, or skepticism about other minds), whereas radical skepticism claims that one cannot know anything—including that one cannot know about knowing anything.

Skepticism can also be classified according to its method. Western philosophy has two basic approaches to skepticism. Cartesian skepticism—named somewhat misleadingly after René Descartes, who was not a skeptic but used some traditional skeptical arguments in his Meditations to help establish his rationalist approach to knowledge—attempts to show that any proposed knowledge claim can be doubted. Agrippan skepticism focuses on justification rather than the possibility of doubt. According to this view, none of the ways in which one might attempt to justify a claim are adequate. One can justify a claim based on other claims, but this leads to an infinite regress of justifications. One can use a dogmatic assertion, but this is not a justification. One can use circular reasoning, but this fails to justify the conclusion.

===Skeptical scenarios===
A skeptical scenario is a hypothetical situation which can be used in an argument for skepticism about a particular claim or class of claims. Usually the scenario posits the existence of a deceptive power that deceives our senses and undermines the justification of knowledge otherwise accepted as justified, and is proposed in order to call into question our ordinary claims to knowledge on the grounds that we cannot exclude the possibility of skeptical scenarios being true. Skeptical scenarios have received a great deal of attention in modern Western philosophy.

The first major skeptical scenario in modern Western philosophy appears in René Descartes&#x27; &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;. At the end of the first Meditation Descartes writes: &quot;I will suppose... that some evil demon of the utmost power and cunning has employed all his energies to deceive me.&quot;
* The &quot;evil demon problem&quot;, also known as &quot;Descartes&#x27; evil demon&quot;, was first proposed by René Descartes. It invokes the possibility of a being who could deliberately mislead one into falsely believing everything that you take to be true.
* The &quot;brain in a vat&quot; hypothesis is cast in contemporary scientific terms. It supposes that one might be a disembodied brain kept alive in a vat and fed false sensory signals by a mad scientist. Further, it asserts that since a brain in a vat would have no way of knowing that it was a brain in a vat, you cannot prove that you are not a brain in a vat.
* The &quot;dream argument&quot;, proposed by both René Descartes and Zhuangzi, supposes reality to be indistinguishable from a dream.
* The &quot;five minute hypothesis&quot;, most notably proposed by Bertrand Russell, suggests that we cannot prove that the world was not created five minutes ago (along with false memories and false evidence suggesting that it was not only five minutes old).
* The &quot;simulated reality hypothesis&quot; or &quot;Matrix hypothesis&quot; suggests that everyone, or even the entire universe, might be inside a computer simulation or virtual reality.
* The &quot;Solipsistic&quot; theory that claims that knowledge of the world is an illusion of the Self.

===Epistemological skepticism===
Skepticism, as an epistemological view, calls into question whether knowledge is possible at all. This is distinct from other known skeptical practices, including Cartesian skepticism, as it targets knowledge in general instead of individual types of knowledge.

Skeptics argue that belief in something does not justify an assertion of knowledge of it. In this, skeptics oppose foundationalism, which states that there are basic positions that are self-justified or beyond justification, without reference to others. (One example of such foundationalism may be found in Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot;.) 

Among other arguments, skeptics use the Münchhausen trilemma and the problem of the criterion to claim that no certain belief can be achieved. This position is known as &quot;global skepticism&quot; or &quot;radical skepticism.&quot; Foundationalists have used the same as a justification for demanding the validity of basic beliefs. Epistemological nihilism rejects the possibility of human knowledge, but not necessarily knowledge in general.

There are two different categories of epistemological skepticism, which can be referred to as mitigated and unmitigated skepticism. The two forms are contrasting but are still true forms of skepticism. Mitigated skepticism does not accept &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;strict&quot; knowledge claims but does, however, approve specific weaker ones. These weaker claims can be assigned the title of &quot;virtual knowledge&quot;, but must be to justified belief. Some mitigated skeptics are also fallibilists, arguing that knowledge does not require certainty. Mitigated skeptics hold that knowledge does not require certainty and that many beliefs are, in practice, certain to the point that they can be safely acted upon in order to live significant and meaningful lives. Unmitigated skepticism rejects both claims of virtual knowledge and strong knowledge. Characterising knowledge as strong, weak, virtual or genuine can be determined differently depending on a person&#x27;s viewpoint as well as their characterisation of knowledge. Unmitigated skeptics believe that objective truths are unknowable and that man should live in an isolated environment in order to win mental peace. This is because everything, according to them, is changing and relative. The refusal to make judgments is of uttermost importance since there is no knowledge; only probable opinions.

===Criticism===
Philosophical skepticism has been criticized in various ways. Some criticisms see it as a self-refuting idea while others point out that it is implausible, psychologically impossible, or a pointless intellectual game. This position is based on the idea that philosophical skepticism not only rejects the existence of knowledge but seems to make knowledge claims itself at the same time. For example, to claim that there is no knowledge seems to be itself a knowledge claim. This problem is particularly relevant for versions of philosophical skepticism that deny any form of knowledge. So the global skeptic denies that any claim is rationally justified but then goes on to provide arguments in an attempt to rationally justify their denial. Some philosophical skeptics have responded to this objection by restricting the denial of knowledge to certain fields without denying the existence of knowledge in general. Another defense consists in understanding philosophical skepticism not as a theory but as a tool or a methodology. In this case, it may be used fruitfully to reject and improve philosophical systems despite its shortcomings as a theory.

Another criticism holds that philosophical skepticism is highly counterintuitive by pointing out how far removed it is from regular life. For example, it seems very impractical, if not psychologically impossible, to suspend all beliefs at the same time. And even if it were possible, it would not be advisable since &quot;the complete skeptic would wind up starving to death or walking into walls or out of windows&quot;. This criticism can allow that there are some arguments that support philosophical skepticism. However, it has been claimed that they are not nearly strong enough to support such a radical conclusion. Common-sense philosophers follow this line of thought by arguing that regular common-sense beliefs are much more reliable than the skeptics&#x27; intricate arguments. George Edward Moore, for example, tried to refute skepticism about the existence of the external world, not by engaging with its complex arguments, but by using a simple observation: that he has two hands. For Moore, this observation is a reliable source of knowledge incompatible with external world skepticism since it entails that at least two physical objects exist.

A closely related objection sees philosophical skepticism as an &quot;idle academic exercise&quot; or a &quot;waste of time&quot;. This is often based on the idea that, because of its initial implausibility and distance from everyday life, it has little or no practical value. In this regard, Arthur Schopenhauer compares the position of radical skepticism to a border fortress that is best ignored: it is impregnable but its garrison does not pose any threat since it never sets foot outside the fortress. One defense of philosophical skepticism is that it has had important impacts on the history of philosophy at large and not just among skeptical philosophers. This is due to its critical attitude, which remains a constant challenge to the epistemic foundations of various philosophical theories. It has often provoked creative responses from other philosophers when trying to modify the affected theory to avoid the problem of skepticism. 

According to Pierre Le Morvan, there are two very common negative responses to philosophical skepticism. The first understands it as a threat to all kinds of philosophical theories and strives to disprove it. According to the second, philosophical skepticism is a useless distraction and should better be avoided altogether. Le Morvan himself proposes a positive third alternative: to use it as a philosophical tool in a few selected cases to overcome prejudices and foster practical wisdom.

== History of Western skepticism ==
=== Ancient Greek skepticism ===

Ancient Greek skeptics were not &quot;skeptics&quot; in the contemporary sense of selective, localized doubt. Their concerns were epistemological, noting that truth claims could not be adequately supported, and psychotherapeutic, noting that beliefs caused mental perturbation.

The Western tradition of systematic skepticism goes back at least as far as Pyrrho of Elis (b. ) and arguably to Xenophanes (b. ). Parts of skepticism also appear among the &quot;5th century sophists [who] develop forms of debate which are ancestors of skeptical argumentation. They take pride in arguing in a persuasive fashion for both sides of an issue.&quot;

In Hellenistic philosophy, Pyrrhonism and Academic Skepticism were the two schools of skeptical philosophy. Subsequently, the words &quot;Academic&quot; and &quot;Pyrrhonist&quot; were often used to mean &quot;skeptic&quot;.

==== Pyrrhonism ====

Like other Hellenistic philosophies, the goal of Pyrrhonism was eudaimonia, which the Pyrrhonists sought through achieving ataraxia (an untroubled state of mind), which they found could be induced by producing a state of epoché (suspension of judgment) regarding non-evident matters. Epoché could be produced by pitting one dogma against another to undermine belief, and by questioning whether a belief could be justified. In support of this questioning Pyrrhonists developed the skeptical arguments cited above (the Ten Modes of Aenesidemus and the Five Modes of Agrippa) demonstrating that beliefs cannot be justified:

===== Pyrrho of Elis =====

According to an account of Pyrrho&#x27;s life by his student Timon of Phlius, Pyrrho extolled a way to become happy and tranquil:

&#x27;The things themselves are equally indifferent, and unstable, and indeterminate, and therefore neither our senses nor our opinions are either true or false. For this reason then we must not trust them, but be without opinions, and without bias, and without wavering, saying of every single thing that it no more is than is not, or both is and is not, or neither is nor is not.

===== Aenesidemus =====

Pyrrhonism faded as a movement following the death of Pyrrho&#x27;s student Timon. The Academy became slowly more dogmatic such that in the first century BCE Aenesidemus denounced the Academics as &quot;Stoics fighting against Stoics&quot;, breaking with the Academy to revive Pyrrhonism. Aenesidemus&#x27;s best known contribution to skepticism was his now-lost book, &quot;Pyrrhonian Discourses&quot;, which is only known to us through Photius, Sextus Empiricus, and to a lesser extent Diogenes Laërtius. The skeptical arguments most closely associated with Aenesidemus are the ten modes described above designed to induce &quot;epoche.&quot; 

===== Sextus Empiricus =====
The works of Sextus Empiricus (c. 200 CE) are the main surviving account of ancient Pyrrhonism. Long before Sextus&#x27; time, the Academy had abandoned skepticism and had been destroyed as a formal institution. Sextus compiled and further developed the Pyrrhonists&#x27; skeptical arguments, most of which were directed against the Stoics but included arguments against all of the schools of Hellenistic philosophy, including the Academic skeptics.

Sextus, as the most systematic author of the works by Hellenistic skeptics which have survived, noted that there are at least &quot;ten modes&quot; of skepticism. These modes may be broken down into three categories: one may be skeptical of &quot;the subjective perceiver, of the objective world&quot;, and &quot;the relation between perceiver and the world&quot;. His arguments are as follows.

&quot;Subjectively&quot;, the powers of the senses and reasoning may vary among different people. And since knowledge is a product of one or the other, and since neither are reliable, knowledge would seem to be in trouble. For instance, a color-blind person sees the world quite differently from everyone else. Moreover, one cannot even give preference based on the power of reason, i.e., by treating the rational animal as a carrier of greater knowledge than the irrational animal, since the irrational animal is still adept at navigating their environment, which suggests the ability to &quot;know&quot; about some aspects of the environment.

Secondly, the personality of the individual might also influence what they observe, since (it is argued) preferences are based on sense-impressions, differences in preferences can be attributed to differences in the way that people are affected by the object. (Empiricus:56)

Third, the perceptions of each individual sense seemingly have nothing in common with the other senses: i.e., the color &quot;red&quot; has little to do with the feeling of touching a red object. This is manifest when our senses &quot;disagree&quot; with each other: for example, a mirage presents certain visible features, but is not responsive to any other kind of sense. In that case, our other senses defeat the impressions of sight. But one may also be lacking enough powers of sense to understand the world in its entirety: if one had an extra sense, then one might know of things in a way that the present five senses are unable to advise us of. Given that our senses can be shown to be unreliable by appealing to other senses, and so our senses may be incomplete (relative to some more perfect sense that one lacks), then it follows that all of our senses may be unreliable. (Empiricus:58)

Fourth, our circumstances when one perceives anything may be either natural or unnatural, i.e., one may be either in a state of wakefulness or sleep. But it is entirely possible that things in the world really are exactly as they appear to be to those in unnatural states (i.e., if everything were an elaborate dream). (Empiricus:59)

One can have reasons for doubt that are based on the &quot;relationship between objective &quot;facts&quot; and subjective experience&quot;. The positions, distances, and places of objects would seem to affect how they are perceived by the person: for instance, the portico may appear tapered when viewed from one end, but symmetrical when viewed at the other; and these features are different. Because they are different features, to believe the object has both properties at the same time is to believe it has two contradictory properties. Since this is absurd, one must suspend judgment about what properties it possesses due to the contradictory experiences. (Empiricus:63)

One may also observe that the things one perceives are, in a sense, polluted by experience. Any given perception—say, of a chair—will always be perceived within some context or other (i.e., next to a table, on a mat, etc.) Since this is the case, one often only speaks of ideas as they occur in the context of the other things that are paired with it, and therefore, one can never know of the true nature of the thing, but only how it appears to us in context. (Empiricus: 64)

Along the same lines, the skeptic may insist that all things are relative, by arguing that:
# Absolute appearances either differ from relative appearances, or they do not.
# If absolutes do not differ from relatives, then they are themselves relative.
# But if absolutes do differ from relatives, then they are relative, because all things that differ must differ from something; and to &quot;differ&quot; from something is to be relative to something. (Empiricus:67)

Finally, one has reason to disbelieve that one knows anything by looking at problems in understanding objects by themselves. Things, when taken individually, may appear to be very different from when they are in mass quantities: for instance, the shavings of a goat&#x27;s horn are white when taken alone, yet the horn intact is black. 

=====Skeptical arguments=====
The ancient Greek Pyrrhonists developed sets of arguments to demonstrate that claims about reality cannot be adequately justified. Two sets of these arguments are well known. The oldest set is known as the ten tropes of Aenesidemus—although whether he invented the tropes or just systematized them from prior Pyrrhonist works is unknown. The tropes represent reasons for epoché (suspension of judgment). These are as follows:

# Different animals manifest different modes of perception;
# Similar differences are seen among individual men;
# For the same man, information perceived with the senses is self-contradictory
# Furthermore, it varies from time to time with physical changes
# In addition, this data differs according to local relations
# Objects are known only indirectly through the medium of air, moisture, etc.
# These objects are in a condition of perpetual change in color, temperature, size and motion
# All perceptions are relative and interact one upon another
# Our impressions become less critical through repetition and custom
# All men are brought up with different beliefs, under different laws and social conditions

Another set are known as the five tropes of Agrippa:

# &quot;Dissent&quot; – The uncertainty demonstrated by the differences of opinions among philosophers and people in general.
# &quot;Progress ad infinitum&quot; – All proof rests on matters themselves in need of proof, and so on to infinity, i.e, the regress argument.
# &quot;Relation&quot; – All things are changed as their relations become changed, or, as we look upon them from different points of view.
# &quot;Assumption&quot; – The truth asserted is based on an unsupported assumption.
# &quot;Circularity&quot; – The truth asserted involves a circularity of proofs.

According to Victor Brochard &quot;the five tropes can be regarded as the most radical and most precise formulation of philosophical skepticism that has ever been given. In a sense, they are still irresistible today.&quot;

==== Academic skepticism ====

Pyrrho&#x27;s thinking subsequently influenced the Platonic Academy, arising first in the Academic skepticism of the Middle Academy under Arcesilaus (c. 315 – 241 BCE) and then the New Academy under Carneades (c. 213–129 BCE). Clitomachus, a student of Carneades, interpreted his teacher&#x27;s philosophy as suggesting an account of knowledge based on truth-likeness. The Roman politician and philosopher, Cicero, was also an adherent of the skepticism of the New Academy, even though a return to a more dogmatic orientation of the school was already beginning to take place.

==== Augustine on skepticism ====

In 386 CE, Augustine published &quot;Contra Academicos&quot; (Against the Academic Skeptics), which argued against claims made by the Academic Skeptics (266–90 BCE) on the following grounds: 
* Objection from Error: Through logic, Augustine argues that philosophical skepticism does not lead to happiness like the Academic Skeptics claim. His arguments is summarized as:
*# A wise man lives according to reason, and thus is able to be happy.
*# One who is searching for knowledge but never finds it is in error.
*# Imperfection objection: People in error are not happy, because being in error is an imperfection, and people cannot be happy with an imperfection.
*# Conclusion: One who is still seeking knowledge cannot be happy.
* Error of Non-Assent: Augustine&#x27;s argument that suspending belief does not fully prevent one from error. His argument is summarized below.
*# Introduction of the error: Let P be true. If a person fails to believe P due to suspension of belief in order to avoid error, the person is also committing an error.
*# The Anecdote of the Two Travelers: Travelers A and B are trying to reach the same destination. At a fork in the road, a poor shepherd tells them to go left. Traveler A immediately believes him and reaches the correct destination. Traveler B suspends belief, and instead believes in the advice of a well-dressed townsman to go right, because his advice seems more persuasive. However, the townsman is actually a &quot;samardocus&quot; (con man) so Traveler B never reaches the correct destination.
*# The Anecdote of the Adulterer: A man suspends belief that adultery is bad, and commits adultery with another man&#x27;s wife because it is persuasive to him. Under Academic Skepticism, this man cannot be charged because he acted on what was persuasive to him without assenting belief.
*# Conclusion: Suspending belief exposes individuals to an error as defined by the Academic Skeptics. 

=== Skepticism&#x27;s revival in the sixteenth century === 

Francisco Sanches&#x27;s &quot;That Nothing is Known&quot; (published in 1581 as &quot;Quod nihil scitur&quot;) is one of the crucial texts of Renaissance skepticism.

==== Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) ====

The most notable figure of the Skepticism revival in the 1500s, Michel de Montaigne wrote about his studies of Academic Skepticism and Pyrrhonism through his Essais.

His most notable writings on skepticism occurred in an essay written mostly in 1575–1576, &quot;Apologie de Raimond Sebond&quot;, when he was reading Sextus Empiricus and trying to translate Raimond Sebond&#x27;s writing, including his proof of Christianity&#x27;s natural existence. The reception to Montaigne&#x27;s translations included some criticisms of Sebond&#x27;s proof. Montaigne responded to some of them in &quot;Apologie,&quot; including a defense for Sebond&#x27;s logic that is skeptical in nature and similar to Pyrrhonism. His refutation is as follows:
# Critics claiming Sebond&#x27;s arguments are weak show how egoistic humans believe that their logic is superior to others&#x27;.
# Many animals can be observed to be superior to humans in certain respects. To argue this point, Montaigne even writes about dogs who are logical and creates their own syllogisms to understand the world around them. This was an example used in Sextus Empiricus.
# Since animals also have rationality, the over-glorification of man&#x27;s mental capabilities is a trap—man&#x27;s folly. One man&#x27;s reason cannot be assuredly better than another&#x27;s as a result.
# Ignorance is even recommended by religion so that an individual can reach faith through obediently following divine instructions to learn, not by one&#x27;s logic.

==== Marin Mersenne (1588–1648) ====

Marin Mersenne was an author, mathematician, scientist, and philosopher. He wrote in defense of science and Christianity against atheists and Pyrrhonists before retiring to encourage development of science and the &quot;new philosophy&quot;, which includes philosophers like Gassendi, Descartes, Galileo, and Hobbes. A major work of his in relation to Skepticism is &quot;La Verité des Sciences&quot;, in which he argues that although we may not be able to know the true nature of things, we can still formulate certain laws and rules for sense-perceptions through science.

Additionally, he points out that we do not doubt everything because:
* Humans do agree about some things, for example, an ant is smaller than an elephant
* There are natural laws governing our sense-perceptions, such as optics, which allow us to eliminate inaccuracies
* Man created tools such as rulers and scales to measure things and eliminate doubts such as bent oars, pigeons&#x27; necks, and round towers.
A Pyrrhonist might refute these points by saying that senses deceive, and thus knowledge turns into infinite regress or circular logic. Thus Mersenne argues that this cannot be the case, since commonly agreed upon rules of thumb can be hypothesized and tested over time to ensure that they continue to hold.

Furthermore, if everything can be doubted, the doubt can also be doubted, so on and so forth. Thus, according to Mersenne, something has to be true. Finally, Mersenne writes about all the mathematical, physical, and other scientific knowledge that is true by repeated testing, and has practical use value. Notably, Mersenne was one of the few philosophers who accepted Hobbes&#x27; radical ideology—he saw it as a new science of man.

=== Skepticism in the seventeenth century ===
==== Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) ====
During his long stay in Paris, Thomas Hobbes was actively involved in the circle of major skeptics like Gassendi and Mersenne who focus on the study of skepticism and epistemology. Unlike his fellow skeptic friends, Hobbes never treated skepticism as a main topic for discussion in his works. Nonetheless, Hobbes was still labeled as a religious skeptic by his contemporaries for raising doubts about Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch and his political and psychological explanation of the religions. Although Hobbes himself did not go further to challenge other religious principles, his suspicion for the Mosaic authorship did significant damage to the religious traditions and paved the way for later religious skeptics like Spinoza and Isaac La Peyrère to further question some of the fundamental beliefs of the Judeo-Christian religious system. Hobbes&#x27; answer to skepticism and epistemology was innovatively political: he believed that moral knowledge and religious knowledge were in their nature relative, and there was no absolute standard of truth governing them. As a result, it was out of political reasons that certain truth standards about religions and ethics were devised and established in order to form a functioning government and stable society.

==== Baruch Spinoza and religious skepticism ====
Baruch Spinoza was among the first European philosophers who were religious skeptics. He was quite familiar with the philosophy of Descartes and unprecedentedly extended the application of the Cartesian method to the religious context by analyzing religious texts with it. Spinoza sought to dispute the knowledge-claims of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic religious system by examining its two foundations: the Scripture and the Miracles. He claimed that all Cartesian knowledge, or the rational knowledge should be accessible to the entire population. Therefore, the Scriptures, aside from those by Jesus, should not be considered the secret knowledge attained from God but just the imagination of the prophets. The Scriptures, as a result of this claim, could not serve as a base for knowledge and were reduced to simple ancient historical texts. Moreover, Spinoza also rejected the possibility for the Miracles by simply asserting that people only considered them miraculous due to their lack of understanding of the nature. By rejecting the validity of the Scriptures and the Miracles, Spinoza demolished the foundation for religious knowledge-claim and established his understanding of the Cartesian knowledge as the sole authority of knowledge-claims. Despite being deeply skeptical of the religions, Spinoza was in fact exceedingly anti-skeptical towards reason and rationality. He steadfastly confirmed the legitimacy of reason by associating it with the acknowledgement of God, and thereby skepticism with the rational approach to knowledge was not due to problems with the rational knowledge but from the fundamental lack of understanding of God. Spinoza&#x27;s religious skepticism and anti-skepticism with reason thus helped him transform epistemology by separating the theological knowledge-claims and the rational knowledge-claims.

==== Pierre Bayle (1647–1706) ====

Pierre Bayle was a French philosopher in the late 17th century that was described by Richard Popkin to be a &quot;supersceptic&quot; who carried out the sceptic tradition to the extreme. Bayle was born in a Calvinist family in Carla-Bayle, and during the early stage of his life, he converted into Catholicism before returning to Calvinism. This conversion between religions caused him to leave France for the more religiously tolerant Holland where he stayed and worked for the rest of his life.

Bayle believed that truth cannot be obtained through reason and that all human endeavor to acquire absolute knowledge would inevitably lead to failure. Bayle&#x27;s main approach was highly skeptical and destructive: he sought to examine and analyze all existing theories in all fields of human knowledge in order to show the faults in their reasoning and thus the absurdity of the theories themselves. In his &quot;magnum opus, Dictionnaire Historique et Critique&quot; &quot;(Historical and Critical Dictionary),&quot; Bayle painstakingly identified the logical flaws in several works throughout the history in order to emphasize the absolute futility of rationality. Bayle&#x27;s complete nullification of reason led him to conclude that faith is the final and only way to truth.

Bayle&#x27;s real intention behind his extremely destructive works remained controversial. Some described him to be a Fideist, while others speculated him to be a secret Atheist. However, no matter what his original intention was, Bayle did cast significant influence on the upcoming Age of Enlightenment with his destruction of some of the most essential theological ideas and his justification of religious tolerance Atheism in his works.

===Skepticism in the Age of Enlightenment===
==== David Hume (1711–1776) ====
David Hume was among the most influential proponents of philosophical skepticism during the Age of Enlightenment and one of the most notable voices of the Scottish Enlightenment and British Empiricism. He especially espoused skepticism regarding inductive reasoning, and questioned what the foundation of morality was, creating the is–ought problem. His approach to skepticism is considered even more radical than that of Descartes.

Hume argued that any coherent idea must be either a mental copy of an impression (a direct sensory perception) or copies of multiple impressions innovatively combined. Since certain human activities like religion, superstition, and metaphysics are not premised on any actual sense-impressions, their claims to knowledge are logically unjustified. Furthermore, Hume even demonstrates that science is merely a psychological phenomenon based on the association of ideas: often, specifically, an assumption of cause-and-effect relationships that is itself not grounded in any sense-impressions. Thus, even scientific knowledge is logically unjustified, being not actually objective or provable but, rather, mere conjecture flimsily based on our minds perceiving regular correlations between distinct events. Hume thus falls into extreme skepticism regarding the possibility of any certain knowledge. Ultimately, he offers that, at best, a science of human nature is the &quot;only solid foundation for the other sciences&quot;.

====Immanuel Kant (1724–1804)====

Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) tried to provide a ground for empirical science against David Hume&#x27;s skeptical treatment of the notion of cause and effect. Hume (1711–1776) argued that for the notion of cause and effect no analysis is possible which is also acceptable to the empiricist program primarily outlined by John Locke (1632–1704). But, Kant&#x27;s attempt to give a ground to knowledge in the empirical sciences at the same time cut off the possibility of knowledge of any other knowledge, especially what Kant called &quot;metaphysical knowledge&quot;. So, for Kant, empirical science was legitimate, but metaphysics and philosophy was mostly illegitimate. The most important exception to this demarcation of the legitimate from the illegitimate was ethics, the principles of which Kant argued can be known by pure reason without appeal to the principles required for empirical knowledge. Thus, with respect to metaphysics and philosophy in general (ethics being the exception), Kant was a skeptic. This skepticism as well as the explicit skepticism of G. E. Schulze gave rise to a robust discussion of skepticism in German idealistic philosophy, especially by Hegel. Kant&#x27;s idea was that the real world (the &quot;noumenon&quot; or thing-in-itself) was inaccessible to human reason (though the empirical world of nature can be known to human understanding) and therefore we can never know anything about the ultimate reality of the world. Hegel argued against Kant that although Kant was right that using what Hegel called &quot;finite&quot; concepts of &quot;the understanding&quot; precluded knowledge of reality, we were not constrained to use only &quot;finite&quot; concepts and could actually acquire knowledge of reality using &quot;infinite concepts&quot; that arise from self-consciousness.

=== Skepticism in the 20th century and contemporary philosophy ===
G. E. Moore famously presented the &quot;Here is one hand&quot; argument against skepticism in his 1925 paper, &quot;A Defence of Common Sense&quot;. Moore claimed that he could prove that the external world exists by simply presenting the following argument while holding up his hands: &quot;Here is one hand; here is another hand; therefore, there are at least two objects; therefore, external-world skepticism fails&quot;. His argument was developed for the purpose of vindicating common sense and refuting skepticism. Ludwig Wittgenstein later argued in his &quot;On Certainty&quot; (posthumously published in 1969) that Moore&#x27;s argument rested on the way that ordinary language is used, rather than on anything about knowledge.

In contemporary philosophy, Richard Popkin was a particularly influential scholar on the topic of skepticism. His account of the history of skepticism given in &quot;The History of Scepticism from Savonarola to Bayle&quot; (first edition published as &quot;The History of Scepticism From Erasmus to Descartes&quot;) was accepted as the standard for contemporary scholarship in the area for decades after its release in 1960. Barry Stroud also published a number of works on philosophical skepticism, most notably his 1984 monograph, &quot;The Significance of Philosophical Scepticism&quot;. From the mid-1990s, Stroud, alongside Richard Fumerton, put forward influential anti-externalist arguments in favour of a position called &quot;metaepistemological scepticism&quot;. Other contemporary philosophers known for their work on skepticism include James Pryor, Keith DeRose, and Peter Klein.

== History of skepticism in non-Western philosophy ==

=== Ancient Indian skepticism ===

====Ajñana====

Ajñana (literally &#x27;non-knowledge&#x27;) were the skeptical school of ancient Indian philosophy. It was a śramaṇa movement and a major rival of early Buddhism and Jainism. They have been recorded in Buddhist and Jain texts. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation.

====Buddhism====

The historical Buddha asserted certain doctrines as true, such as the possibility of nirvana; however, he also upheld a form of skepticism with regards to certain questions which he left &quot;un-expounded&quot; (&quot;avyākata&quot;) and some he saw as &quot;incomprehensible&quot; (&quot;acinteyya&quot;). Because the Buddha saw these questions (which tend to be of metaphysical topics) as unhelpful on the path and merely leading to confusion and &quot;a thicket of views&quot;, he promoted suspension of judgment towards them. This allowed him to carve out an epistemic middle way between what he saw as the extremes of claiming absolute objectivity (associated with the claims to omniscience of the Jain Mahavira) and extreme skepticism (associated with the Ajñana thinker Sanjaya Belatthiputta).

Later Buddhist philosophy remained highly skeptical of Indian metaphysical arguments. The Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna in particular has been seen as the founder of the Madhyamaka school, which has been in turn compared with Greek Skepticism. Nagarjuna&#x27;s statement that he has &quot;no thesis&quot; (&quot;pratijña&quot;) has parallels in the statements of Sextus Empiricus of having &quot;no position&quot;. Nagarjuna famously opens his magnum opus, the &quot;Mulamadhyamakakarika&quot;, with the statement that the Buddha claimed that true happiness was found through dispelling &#x27;vain thinking&#x27; (prapañca, also &quot;conceptual proliferation&quot;).

According to Richard P. Hayes, the Buddhist philosopher Dignaga is also a kind of skeptic, which is in line with most early Buddhist philosophy. Hayes writes:

...in both early Buddhism and in the Skeptics one can find the view put forward that man&#x27;s pursuit of happiness, the highest good, is obstructed by his tenacity in holding ungrounded and unnecessary opinions about all manner of things. Much of Buddhist philosophy, I shall argue, can be seen as an attempt to break this habit of holding on to opinions.

Scholars like Adrian Kuzminski have argued that Pyrrho of Elis (ca. 365–270) might have been influenced by Indian Buddhists during his journey with Alexander the Great.

====Cārvāka philosophy====
The Cārvāka (Sanskrit: चार्वाक) school of materialism, also known as Lokāyata, is a classically cited (but historically disputed) school of ancient Indian philosophy. While no texts or authoritative doctrine have survived, followers of this system are frequently mentioned in philosophical treatises of other schools, often as an initial counterpoint against which to assert their own arguments. 

Cārvāka is classified as a &quot;heterodox&quot; (nāstika) system, characterized as a materialistic and atheistic school of thought. This school was also known for being strongly skeptical of the claims of Indian religions, such as reincarnation and karma.

====Jainism====

While Jain philosophy claims that is it possible to achieve omniscience, absolute knowledge (Kevala Jnana), at the moment of enlightenment, their theory of anekāntavāda or &#x27;many sided-ness&#x27;, also known as the principle of relative pluralism, allows for a practical form of skeptical thought regarding philosophical and religious doctrines (for un-enlightened beings, not all-knowing arihants).

According to this theory, the truth or the reality is perceived differently from different points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth. Jain doctrine states that, an object has infinite modes of existence and qualities and, as such, they cannot be completely perceived in all its aspects and manifestations, due to inherent limitations of the humans. Anekāntavāda is literally the doctrine of non-onesidedness or manifoldness; it is often translated as &quot;non-absolutism&quot;. Syādvāda is the theory of conditioned predication which provides an expression to anekānta by recommending that epithet &quot;Syād&quot; be attached to every expression. Syādvāda is not only an extension of Anekānta ontology, but a separate system of logic capable of standing on its own force. As reality is complex, no single proposition can express the nature of reality fully. Thus the term &quot;syāt&quot; should be prefixed before each proposition giving it a conditional point of view and thus removing any dogmatism in the statement. For Jains, fully enlightened beings are able to see reality from all sides and thus have ultimate knowledge of all things. This idea of omniscience was criticized by Buddhists such as Dharmakirti.

=== Ancient Chinese philosophy ===
==== Zhuang Zhou (c. 369 – c. 286 BCE) ====
Zhuang Zhou (莊子，&quot;Master Zhuang&quot;) was a famous ancient Chinese Taoism philosopher during the Hundred Schools of Thought period. Zhuang Zhou demonstrated his skeptical thinking through several anecdotes in the preeminent work Zhuangzi attributed to him:
* &quot;The Debate on the Joy of Fish&quot; (知魚之樂) : In this anecdote, Zhuang Zhou argued with his fellow philosopher Hui Shi whether they knew the fish in the pond were happy or not, and Zhuang Zhou made the famous observation that &quot;You are not I. How do you know that I do not know that the fish are happy?&quot; (Autumn Floods 秋水篇, Zhuangzi)
* &quot;The Butterfly of the Dream&quot;(周公夢蝶) : The paradox of &quot;Butterfly Dream&quot; described Zhuang Zhou&#x27;s confusion after dreaming himself to be a butterfly: &quot;But he didn&#x27;t know if he was Zhuang Zhou who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming that he was Zhuang Zhou.&quot; (Discussion on Making All Things Equal 齊物篇, Zhuangzi)
Through these anecdotes in Zhuangzi, Zhuang Zhou indicated his belief in the limitation of language and human communication and the inaccessibility of universal truth. This establishes him as a skeptic. But he was by no means a radical skeptic: he only applied skeptical methods partially, in arguments demonstrating his Taoist beliefs. He held the Taoist beliefs themselves dogmatically.

==== Wang Chong (27 – CE) ====
Wang Chong () was the leading figure of the skeptic branch of the Confucianism school in China during the first century CE. He introduced a method of rational critique and applied it to the widespread dogmatism thinking of his age like phenomenology (the main contemporary Confucianism ideology that linked all natural phenomena with human ethics), state-led cults, and popular superstition. His own philosophy incorporated both Taoism and Confucianism thinkings, and it was based on a secular, rational practice of developing hypotheses based on natural events to explain the universe which exemplified a form of naturalism that resembled the philosophical idea of Epicureans like Lucretius.

=== Medieval Islamic philosophy ===
&quot;The Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;, written by the scholar Al-Ghazali (1058–1111), marks a major turn in Islamic epistemology. His encounter with skepticism led Ghazali to embrace a form of theological occasionalism, or the belief that all causal events and interactions are not the product of material conjunctions but rather the immediate and present will of God. 

In the autobiography Ghazali wrote towards the end of his life, &quot;The Deliverance From Error&quot; (&quot;Al-munqidh min al-ḍalāl&quot; ), Ghazali recounts how, once a crisis of epistemological skepticism was resolved by &quot;a light which God Most High cast into my breast...the key to most knowledge&quot;, he studied and mastered the arguments of Kalam, Islamic philosophy, and Ismailism. Though appreciating what was valid in the first two of these, at least, he determined that all three approaches were inadequate and found ultimate value only in the mystical experience and spiritual insight he attained as a result of following Sufi practices. William James, in &quot;Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;, considered the autobiography an important document for &quot;the purely literary student who would like to become acquainted with the inwardness of religions other than the Christian&quot;, comparing it to recorded personal religious confessions and autobiographical literature in the Christian tradition.

=== Aztec philosophy ===
Recordings of Aztec philosophy suggest that the elite classes believed in an essentially panentheistic worldview, in which teotl represents a unified, underlying universal force. Human beings cannot truly perceive teotl due to its chaotic, constantly changing nature, just the &quot;masks&quot;/facets it is manifested as.

<text>Scientific skepticism or rational skepticism (also spelled scepticism), sometimes referred to as skeptical inquiry, is a position in which one questions the veracity of claims lacking scientific evidence. In practice, the term most commonly refers to the examination of claims and theories that appear to be unscientific, rather than the routine discussions and challenges among scientists. Scientific skepticism differs from philosophical skepticism, which questions humans&#x27; ability to claim any knowledge about the nature of the world and how they perceive it, and the similar but distinct methodological skepticism, which is a systematic process of being skeptical about (or doubting) the truth of one&#x27;s beliefs.

The skeptical movement (British spelling: sceptical movement) is a contemporary social movement based on the idea of scientific skepticism. The movement has the goal of investigating claims made on fringe topics and determining whether they are supported by empirical research and are reproducible, as part of a methodological norm pursuing &quot;the extension of certified knowledge&quot;.

Roots of the movement date at least from the 19th century, when people started publicly raising questions regarding the unquestioned acceptance of claims about spiritism, of various widely held superstitions, and of pseudoscience.
Publications such as those of the Dutch Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij (1881) also targeted medical quackery. Using as a template the Belgian organization founded in 1949, Comité Para, Americans Paul Kurtz and Marcello Truzzi founded the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), in Amherst, New York, in 1976. Now known as the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), this organization has inspired others to form similar groups worldwide.

== Overview ==
Scientific skeptics maintain that empirical investigation of reality leads to the most reliable empirical knowledge, and suggest that the scientific method is best suited to verifying results. Scientific skeptics attempt to evaluate claims based on verifiability and falsifiability; they discourage accepting claims which rely on faith or anecdotal evidence.

Paul Kurtz described scientific skepticism in his 1992 book The &quot;New Skepticism&quot;, calling it an essential part of scientific inquiry. The Skeptics Society describes it as &quot;the application of reason to any and all ideas—no sacred cows allowed.&quot; Robert K. Merton introduced Mertonian norms, which assert that all ideas must be tested and are subject to rigorous, structured community scrutiny. Kendrick Frazier said that scientific skeptics have a commitment to science, reason, evidence, and the quest for truth. Carl Sagan emphasized the importance of being able to ask skeptical questions, recognizing fallacious or fraudulent arguments, and considering the validity of an argument rather than simply whether we like the conclusion. Similarly, Steven Novella described skepticism as selecting &quot;beliefs and conclusions that are reliable and valid to ones that are comforting or convenient&quot; and as the study of &quot;pitfalls of human reason and the mechanisms of deception so as to avoid being deceived by others or themselves&quot;. Brian Dunning called skepticism &quot;the process of finding a supported conclusion, not the justification of a preconceived conclusion.&quot;
Skeptics often focus their criticism on claims they consider implausible, dubious or clearly contradictory to generally accepted science. Scientific skeptics do not assert that unusual claims should be automatically rejected out of hand on &quot;a priori&quot; grounds—rather they argue that one should critically examine claims of paranormal or anomalous phenomena and that extraordinary claims would require extraordinary evidence in their favor before they could be accepted as having validity. From a scientific point of view, skeptics judge ideas on many criteria, including falsifiability, Occam&#x27;s Razor, Morgan&#x27;s Canon and explanatory power, as well as the degree to which their predictions match experimental results.

Skepticism in general may be deemed part of the scientific method; for instance an experimental result is not regarded as established until it can be shown to be repeatable independently.

The Sci.Skeptic FAQ characterizes the skeptic spectrum as divided into &quot;wet&quot; and &quot;dry&quot; sceptics, primarily based on the level of engagement with those promoting claims that appear to be pseudoscience; the dry skeptics preferring to debunk and ridicule, in order to avoid giving attention and thus credence to the promoters, and the &quot;wet&quot; skeptics, preferring slower and more considered engagement, in order to avoid appearing sloppy and ill-considered and thus similar to the groups all skeptics opposed.

Ron Lindsay has argued that while some non-scientific claims appear to be harmless or &quot;soft targets&quot;, it is important to continue to address them and the underlying habits of thought that lead to them so that we do not &quot;have a lot more people believing that 9/11 was an inside job, that climate change is a hoax, that our government is controlled by aliens, and so forth—and those beliefs are far from harmless&quot;.

=== Skeptical movement ===

With regard to the skeptical social movement, Daniel Loxton refers to other movements already promoting &quot;humanism, atheism, rationalism, science education and even critical thinking&quot; beforehand.
He saw the demand for the new movement—a movement of people called &quot;skeptics&quot;—as based on a lack of interest by the scientific community to address paranormal and fringe-science claims. In line with Kendrick Frazier, he describes the movement as a surrogate in that area for institutional science.
The movement set up a distinct field of study, and provided an organizational structure, while &quot;the long-standing genre of individual skeptical writing&quot; lacked such a community and background.
Skeptical organizations typically tend to have science education and promotion among their goals.

The skeptical movement has had issues with allegations of sexism. Mary Coulman identified a disparity between women and men in the movement in a 1985 skeptic newsletter. The skeptic movement has generally been made up of men; at a 1987 conference the members there discussed the fact that the attendees were predominantly older white men and a 1991 listing of 50 CSICOP fellows included four women. Following a 2011 conference, Rebecca Watson, a prominent skeptic, raised issues of the way female skeptics are targeted with online harassment including threats of sexual violence by opponents of the movement, and also raised issues of sexism within the movement itself. While she received some support in response to her discussion of sexism within the movement, she later became a target of virulent online harassment, even from fellow skeptics, after posting an online video that discussed her discomfort with being propositioned in a confined space. This became known as &quot;Elevatorgate&quot;, based on Watson&#x27;s discussion about being propositioned in a hotel elevator in the early morning after a skeptic event.

== Debunking and rational inquiry ==

The verb &quot;to debunk&quot; is used to describe efforts by skeptics to expose or discredit claims believed to be false, exaggerated, or pretentious. It is closely associated with skeptical investigation or rational inquiry of controversial topics (compare list of topics characterized as pseudoscience) such as U.F.O.s, claimed paranormal phenomena, cryptids, conspiracy theories, alternative medicine, religion, or exploratory or fringe areas of scientific or pseudoscientific research.

Further topics that scientifically skeptical literature questions include health claims surrounding certain foods, procedures, and alternative medicines; the plausibility and existence of supernatural abilities (e.g. tarot reading) or entities (e.g. poltergeists, angels, gods—including Zeus); the monsters of cryptozoology (e.g. the Loch Ness monster); as well as creationism/intelligent design, dowsing, conspiracy theories, and other claims the skeptic sees as unlikely to be true on scientific grounds.

Skeptics such as James Randi have become famous for debunking claims related to some of these. Paranormal investigator Joe Nickell cautions, however, that &quot;debunkers&quot; must be careful to engage paranormal claims seriously and without bias. He explains that open minded investigation is more likely to teach and change minds than debunking.

A striking characteristic of the skeptical movement is the fact that while most of the phenomena covered, such as astrology and homeopathy, have been debunked again and again, they stay popular. Frazier reemphasized in 2018 that &quot;[w]e need independent, evidence-based, science-based critical investigation and inquiry now more than perhaps at any other time in our history.&quot;

The scientific skepticism community has traditionally been focused on what people believe rather than why they believe—there might be psychological, cognitive or instinctive reasons for belief when there is little evidence for such beliefs. According to Hammer, the bulk of the skeptical movement&#x27;s literature works on an implicit model, that belief in the irrational is being based on scientific illiteracy or cognitive illusions. He points to the skeptical discussion about astrology: The skeptical notion of astrology as a &quot;failed hypothesis&quot; fails to address basic anthropological assumptions about astrology as a form of ritualized divination. While the anthropological approach attempts to explain the activities of astrologers and their clients, the skeptical movement&#x27;s interest in the cultural aspects of such beliefs is muted.

According to sociologist David J. Hess, the skeptical discourse tends to set science and the skeptical project apart from the social and the economic. From this perspective, he argues that skepticism takes on some aspects of a sacred discourse, as in Emile Durkheim&#x27;s &quot;Elementary Forms of the Religious Life&quot;—Science, seen as pure and sacred (motivated by values of the mind and reason), is set apart from popular dealings with the paranormal, seen as profane (permeated by the economic and the social); obscuring the confrontation between science and religion. Hess states as well a strong tendency in othering: both skeptics and their opponents see the other as being driven by materialistic philosophy and material gain and assume themselves to have purer motives.

=== Perceived dangers of pseudoscience ===

While not all pseudoscientific beliefs are necessarily dangerous, some can potentially be harmful. Plato believed that to release others from ignorance despite their initial resistance is a great and noble thing. Modern skeptical writers address this question in a variety of ways. Bertrand Russell argued that some individual actions based on beliefs for which there is no evidence of efficacy, can result in destructive actions.
James Randi often wrote on the issue of fraud by psychics and faith healers. Unqualified medical practice and alternative medicine can result in serious injury and death. Skeptical activist Tim Farley, who aims to create catalogue of harmful pseudoscientific practices and cases of damage caused by them, estimates documented number of killed or injured to be more than 600,000. Richard Dawkins points to religion as a source of violence (notably in &quot;The God Delusion&quot;), and considers creationism a threat to biology. Some skeptics, such as the members of &quot;The Skeptics&#x27; Guide to the Universe&quot; podcast, oppose certain new religious movements because of their cult-like behaviors.

Leo Igwe, Junior Fellow at the Bayreuth International Graduate School of African Studies and past Research Fellow of the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF), wrote &quot;A Manifesto for a Skeptical Africa&quot;, which received endorsements from multiple public activists in Africa, as well as skeptical endorsers around the world. He is a Nigerian human rights advocate and campaigner against the impacts of child witchcraft accusations. Igwe came into conflict with high-profile witchcraft believers, leading to attacks on himself and his family.

In 2018, Amardeo Sarma provided some perspective on the state of the skeptical movement by addressing &quot;the essence of contemporary skepticism and [highlighting] the vital nonpartisan and science-based role of skeptics in preventing deception and harm.&quot; He emphasized the dangers of pseudoscience as a reason for prioritizing skeptical work.

=== Pseudoskepticism ===

Richard Cameron Wilson, in an article in &quot;New Statesman&quot;, wrote that &quot;the bogus sceptic is, in reality, a disguised dogmatist, made all the more dangerous for his success in appropriating the mantle of the unbiased and open-minded inquirer&quot;. Some advocates of discredited intellectual positions (such as AIDS denial, Holocaust denial and climate change denial) engage in pseudoskeptical behavior when they characterize themselves as &quot;skeptics&quot;. This is despite their cherry picking of evidence that conforms to a pre-existing belief. According to Wilson, who highlights the phenomenon in his 2008 book &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;, the characteristic feature of false skepticism is that it &quot;centres not on an impartial search for the truth, but on the defence of a preconceived ideological position&quot;.

Scientific skepticism is itself sometimes criticized on this ground. The term &quot;pseudoskepticism&quot; has found occasional use in controversial fields where opposition from scientific skeptics is strong. For example, in 1994, Susan Blackmore, a parapsychologist who became more skeptical and eventually became a Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) fellow in 1991, described what she termed the &quot;worst kind of pseudoskepticism&quot;:

Commenting on the labels &quot;dogmatic&quot; and &quot;pathological&quot; that the &quot;Association for Skeptical Investigation&quot; puts on critics of paranormal investigations, Bob Carroll of the &quot;Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; argues that that association &quot;is a group of pseudo-skeptical paranormal investigators and supporters who do not appreciate criticism of paranormal studies by truly genuine skeptics and critical thinkers. The only skepticism this group promotes is skepticism of critics and [their] criticisms of paranormal studies.&quot;

== History ==

=== Historical roots ===

According to skeptic author Daniel Loxton, &quot;skepticism is a story without a beginning or an end.&quot; His 2013 article in &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine &quot;Why Is There a Skeptical Movement&quot; claims a history of two millennia of paranormal skepticism. He is of the opinion that the practice, problems, and central concepts extend all the way to antiquity and refers to a debunking tale as told in some versions of the Old Testament, where the Prophet Daniel exposes a tale of a &quot;living&quot; statue as a scam. According to Loxton, throughout history, there are further examples of individuals practicing critical inquiry and writing books or performing publicly against particular frauds and popular superstitions, including people like Lucian of Samosata (2nd century), Michel de Montaigne (16th century), Thomas Ady and Thomas Browne (17th century), Antoine Lavoisier and Benjamin Franklin (18th century), many different philosophers, scientists and magicians throughout the 19th and early 20th century up until and after Harry Houdini. However, skeptics banding together in societies that research the paranormal and fringe science is a modern phenomenon.

Two early important works influential to the skeptical movement were Daniel Webster Hering&#x27;s &quot;Foibles and Fallacies of Science&quot; (1924) and D. H. Rawcliffe&#x27;s &quot;The Psychology of the Occult&quot;.

Loxton mentions the Belgian Comité Para (1949) as the oldest &quot;broad mandate&quot; skeptical organization. Although it was preceded by the Dutch Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij (VtdK) (1881), which is therefore considered the oldest skeptical organization by others, the VtdK only focuses on fighting quackery, and thus has a &#x27;narrow mandate&#x27;. The Comité Para was partly formed as a response to a predatory industry of bogus psychics who were exploiting the grieving relatives of people who had gone missing during the Second World War. In contrast, Michael Shermer traces the origins of the modern scientific skeptical movement to Martin Gardner&#x27;s 1952 book &quot;Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science&quot;.

In 1968, the French Association for Scientific Information (AFIS) was founded. AFIS strives to promote science against those who deny its cultural value, abuse it for criminal purposes or as a cover for quackery. According to AFIS, science itself cannot solve humanity&#x27;s problems, nor can one solve them without using the scientific method. It maintains that people should be informed about scientific and technical advancements and the problems it helps to solve. Its magazine, &quot;Science et pseudo-sciences&quot;, attempts to distribute scientific information in a language that everyone can understand.

=== CSICOP and contemporary skepticism ===
In 1976, the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), known as the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) since November 2006, was founded in the United States. Some see this as the &quot;birth of modern skepticism&quot;, however, founder Paul Kurtz actually modeled it after the Comité Para, including its name. Kurtz&#x27; motive was being &quot;dismayed ... by the rising tide of belief in the paranormal and the lack of adequate scientific examinations of these claims.&quot;

Kurtz was an atheist and had also founded the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion. While he saw both aspects as being covered in the skeptical movement, he had recommended CSICOP to focus on paranormal and pseudoscientific claims and to leave religious aspects to others. Despite not being the oldest, CSICOP was &quot;the first successful, broad-mandate North American skeptical organization of the contemporary period&quot;, popularized the usage of the terms &quot;skeptic&quot;, &quot;skeptical&quot; and &quot;skepticism&quot; by its magazine, &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, and directly inspired the foundation of many other skeptical organizations throughout the world, especially in Europe.

These included Australian Skeptics (1980), Vetenskap och Folkbildning (Sweden, 1982), New Zealand Skeptics (1986), GWUP (Austria, Germany and Switzerland, 1987), Skepsis r.y. (Finland, 1987), Stichting Skepsis (Netherlands, 1987), CICAP (Italy, 1989) and SKEPP (Dutch-speaking Belgium, 1990).

Besides scientists such as astronomers, stage magicians like James Randi were important in investigating charlatans and exposing their trickery. In 1996 Randi formed the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) and created the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, where anyone who could demonstrate paranormal abilities, under mutually agreed-upon controlled circumstances, could claim the prize. After Randi&#x27;s retirement in 2015, the Paranormal Challenge was officially terminated by the JREF with the prize unclaimed:

Other influential second-generation American organizations were The Skeptics Society (founded in 1992 by Michael Shermer), the New England Skeptical Society (originating in 1996) and the Independent Investigations Group (formed in 2000 by James Underdown).

=== After 1989 ===
After the Revolutions of 1989, Eastern Europe saw a surge in quackery and paranormal beliefs that were no longer restrained by the generally secular Communist regimes or the Iron curtain and its information barriers. The foundation of many new skeptical organizations was as well intending to protect consumers. These included the Czech Skeptics&#x27; Club Sisyfos (1995), the Hungarian Skeptic Society (2006), the Polish Sceptics Club (2010) and the Russian-speaking Skeptic Society (2013). The Austrian Skeptical Society in Vienna (founded in 2002) deals with issues such as Johann Grander&#x27;s &quot;vitalized water&quot; and the use of dowsing at the Austrian Parliament&quot;.

The European Skeptics Congress (ESC) has been held throughout Europe since 1989, from 1994 onwards co-ordinated by the European Council of Skeptical Organizations. In the United States, The Amaz!ng Meeting (TAM) hosted by the JREF in Las Vegas had been the most important skeptical conference since 2003, with two spin-off conferences in London, UK (2009 and 2010) and one in Sydney, Australia (2010). Since 2010, the Merseyside Skeptics Society and Greater Manchester Skeptics jointly organized Question, Explore, Discover (QED) in Manchester, UK. World Skeptics Congresses have been held so far, namely in Buffalo, New York (1996), Heidelberg, Germany (1998), Sydney, Australia (2000), Burbank, California (2002), Abano Terme, Italy (2004) and Berlin, Germany (2012).

In 1991, the Center for Inquiry, a US think-tank, brought the CSICOP and the Council for Secular Humanism (CSH) under one umbrella. In January 2016, the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science announced its merger with the Center for Inquiry.

In 2010, as a form of skeptical outreach to the general population, Susan Gerbic launched the Guerrilla Skepticism on Wikipedia (GSoW) project to improve skeptical content on Wikipedia.

<doc id="204514" wikidata="Q6650730" url="?curid=204514" title="Little London, Tadley, Hampshire">
<text>Little London is a village situated between the North Hampshire Downs and the gravel plains of the Kennet valley, north of Basingstoke and south of Reading. It is situated within Pamber civil parish and backs on to Pamber Forest, a SSSI and remnant of the much larger ancient Royal Forest of Pamber. It is recorded as having been established for at least 400 years.

==History==
Until the mid 19th century the village was a local centre for brick-making, the local clays being recognised as particularly good since the Roman period. Examples of clay roof tiles produced in this area for the nearby Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum (near modern Silchester) can be seen at Reading Museum.

A major part of the village was confiscated from the Englefield family and given to the Benyon family during the late Tudor period. Other parts were gifted in payment to The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. It is assumed that this was in return for education, although it may not have been. This legacy can be seen by the names of farms, pubs and houses in the area.

The village has grown organically from a few houses, being effectively one street with no social centre to small village of about 120 properties. The village was originally a small hamlet comprising a few farms, two public houses and farm worker&#x27;s dwellings. In the 19th Century, two brickyards were on either side of the road near The Plough, continuing a tradition dating from Roman times. It is a desirable location, resulting in upper quartile house prices typical of rural Hampshire. The village has one Pub, The Plough, which maintains a very traditional &#x27;English Pub&#x27; environment.
&#x27;Little London&#x27; is a common village name in England, assumed by some to have its origins in the quantity of seasonal Londoners who would camp for the harvest season. However, in common with many &#x27;Little Londons&#x27; approximately or so from London, it has also been claimed that the name was given by settlers escaping the Great Plague of London of 1665. Alternatively, it could have been corrupted from &#x27;Little Loddon&#x27;, the name of a stream that marks the Southern extent of the village.

Little London at Tadley would have been established by the Welsh cattle drovers in the second half of the 16th century. It was on a main drovers route into London, like that at Oakley in Buckinghamshire. There have been at least 70 communities established in England and Wales, many of which still exist. They were temporary &quot;homes&quot; for the long distance drovers, moving their cattle to London, and the great fairs and markets of England. Tadley was on the route to the fairs of Blackbush, Farnham, Croydon and Kingston, and London&#x27;s Smithfield market. The sites
were established on common land away from other communities. The drovers had a licence to travel, granted by Elizabeth 1st, and were regarded as &quot;foreigners&quot; by the local parishioners who could not travel without a &quot;settlement certificate&quot;.

==Governance==
The village of Little London is part of the civil parish of Pamber, which covers Pamber Heath, Pamber End, Pamber Green and Little London and meets in Pamber Heath Memorial Hall and St. Stephen&#x27;s Hall, Little London. It is also part of the Pamber and Silchester ward of Basingstoke and Deane borough council. The borough council is a Non-metropolitan district of Hampshire County Council.

==Geography==
==Community facilities==
The main facility for the community is St. Stephens Hall, Silchester Road.

==Transport==
The village is served by Stagecoach South bus route 14 to Basingstoke and Tadley. The nearest railway station is Bramley, to the east. Bus 14 sometimes terminates at Berry Court, just nearby.

==Religious sites==

The church of St Stephen on Silchester Road is part of the Deanery of Basingstoke and the Diocese of Winchester and is linked to the parish of Bramley. There was also a Methodist Chapel on Silchester Road, built in 1867 which closed c1980 and was converted to a Bed and breakfast.

<doc id="204517" wikidata="Q700710" url="?curid=204517" title="Battle of Villers-Bocage">
<text>The Battle of Villers-Bocage took place during the Second World War on 13 June 1944, one week after the Normandy landings, which had begun the Western Allies&#x27; conquest of German-occupied France. The battle was the result of a British attempt to exploit a gap in the German defences west of the city of Caen. After one day of fighting in and around the small town of Villers-Bocage and a second day defending a position outside the town, the British force retreated.

The Allies and the Germans regarded control of Caen as vital to the Normandy campaign. In the days following the D-Day landings on 6June, the Germans rapidly dug in north of the city. On 9June, a two-pronged British attempt to surround and capture Caen was defeated. On the right of the British Second Army, the 1st US Infantry Division had forced back the German 352nd Infantry Division and opened a gap in the German front. To bypass the German Panzer-Lehr Division blocking the direct route south in the area of Tilly-sur-Seulles, a mixed force of tanks, infantry and artillery, based on the 22nd Armoured Brigade (Brigadier William &quot;Loony&quot; Hinde) of the 7th Armoured Division, advanced through the gap in a flanking manoeuvre towards Villers-Bocage. British commanders hoped that the appearance of a strong force in their rear would surround the Panzer-Lehr Division or force it to withdraw.

The 22nd Armoured Brigade group reached Villers-Bocage without serious incident on the morning of 13 June. The leading elements advanced eastwards from the town on the Caen road to a ridge at Point 213, where they were ambushed by Tiger I tanks of the 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. In a few minutes, tanks, anti-tank guns and transport vehicles were destroyed, many by SS-&quot;Obersturmführer&quot; Michael Wittmann. The Germans attacked the town and were repulsed, losing several Tigers and Panzer IVs. After six hours, Hinde ordered a withdrawal to a more defensible position on a knoll west of Villers-Bocage. The next day, the Germans attacked the brigade box, arranged for all-round defence, in the Battle of the Island. The British inflicted a costly repulse on the Germans and then retired from the salient. The Battle for Caen continued east of Villers-Bocage, the ruins of which were captured on 4August, after two raids by strategic bombers of RAF Bomber Command.

The British conduct of the Battle of Villers-Bocage has been controversial, because their withdrawal marked the end of the post–D-Day &quot;scramble for ground&quot; and the start of an attritional battle for Caen. Some historians have written that the British attack was a failure caused by a lack of conviction among some senior commanders, rather than the fighting power of the German army, while others judge the British force to have been insufficient for the task. The &quot;single-handed&quot; attack by Wittmann early on has excited imaginations, to the extent that some historians and writers conclude that it has dominated the historical record to an unwarranted degree and that while &quot;remarkable&quot;, his role has been exaggerated.

==Background==

===D-Day and Operation Perch===
The British 3rd Infantry Division of I Corps, came ashore on Sword Beach on 6June 1944, with Caen— inland—as their final objective. The vicinity of Caen was attractive to Allied planners because it contained airfields and was open, dry and conducive to swift offensive operations, for which the Allies had the advantage of numerical superiority in tanks and mobile units. The attempt to capture Caen on D-Day was ambitious but traffic jams on the beaches delayed the 27th Armoured Brigade. The advance of the 3rd Infantry Division diminished as it fought past German fortifications and was stopped short of Caen before dark, by elements of the 21st Panzer Division.

The next day, the British began Operation Perch, an advance to the south-east of Caen, according to a contingency in the invasion plan. I Corps continued the attack towards Caen but the Germans were able to reinforce the defenders, which made it impossible to rush the city with small numbers of men and tanks. On 9June, the Allied ground forces commander, General Bernard Montgomery, revised Operation Perch to be a bigger attack with a pincer movement to surround the city. After delays caused by the time taken to get the attacking forces into position, simultaneous attacks began west and east of Caen on 12 June. On the east side of the Orne River, in the airborne bridgehead, two brigades of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division were held up by the 21st Panzer Division and on 13 June the attack was called off. To the west of Caen, XXX Corps was unable to advance south of the village of Tilly-sur-Seulles against the Panzer-Lehr Division, one of the most powerful armoured formations in the German army, which had recently arrived in Normandy.

===Caumont Gap===
The envelopment of Caen had been prevented by the Germans on the right flank of XXX Corps, at the junction between the British Second Army (Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey) and the First US Army; five German &quot;Kampfgruppen&quot; (battle groups), including the last reserves of LXXXIV Korps, had been destroyed, leaving only the remnants of the 352nd Infantry Division defending the front from Trévières to Agy. American attacks caused the left flank of the division to collapse and on the night of 9/10 June the division retreated to Saint-Lô, leaving a -gap between the Panzer-Lehr Division and the German troops near Caumont-l&#x27;Éventé, with only the 17th SS-Panzergrenadier Division reconnaissance battalion in the area. The Germans intended to fill the gap with the 2nd Panzer Division, but on 10 June the bulk of it was still between Amiens and Alençon and not expected to arrive in strength until 13 June. Although reluctant to commit the 2nd Panzer Division piecemeal, &quot;General der Panzertruppe&quot; Hans Freiherr von Funck, commander of the XLVII &quot;Panzer Korps&quot;, rushed the divisional reconnaissance battalion to Caumont to hold the high ground.

Dempsey ordered the XXX Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Gerard Bucknall and the 7th Armoured Division commander, Major-General George Erskine, to disengage the 7th Armoured Division from Tilly-sur-Seulles, move through the gap, seize Villers-Bocage and menace the exposed left flank of the Panzer-Lehr Division. The British objective was a ridge to the east of Villers-Bocage. Dempsey hoped that its capture would force the Panzer-Lehr Division to withdraw or risk being surrounded. The 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and most of the infantry brigade of the 7th Armoured Division were to continue the attack against the Panzer-Lehr Division around Tilly-sur-Seulles; the 1st US Infantry Division and 2nd US Infantry Division of the V US Corps would continue their advance.

The 7th Armoured Division spent the morning of 12 June attacking towards Tilly-sur-Seulles according to its original orders; at 12:00 Erskine ordered Hinde to move the 22nd Armoured Brigade immediately through the gap. Soon afterwards, the 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars, the divisional reconnaissance regiment, began to reconnoitre a route for the brigade and the rest of the division left Trungy at around 16:00. Four hours later the main body was close to Livry after a unopposed advance, the last of which was through German-held territory. The leading Cromwell tank of the 8th Hussars was destroyed by an anti-tank gun of the Panzer-Lehr Division Escort Company, which held out for two hours. Taylor wrote that the lead tank was destroyed and Forty wrote that a leading tank was lost. Hoping to mislead the Germans about the objective, on reaching the vicinity of la Mulotiere, north of Livry, Hinde ordered a halt for the night. The 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish and 11th (Prince Albert&#x27;s Own) Hussars, the XXX Corps armoured car regiment, reconnoitred the flanks. The 11th Hussars encountered no resistance on the right flank and gained touch with the 1st US Infantry Division near Caumont. On the left flank, 3 Troop, A Squadron, 8th Hussars, located elements of the Panzer-Lehr Division less than away. The two leading tanks were knocked out by an anti-tank gun and the Troop leader, Lieutenant H. Talbot Harvey, was killed along with six other members of his troop.

==Plan==
It was clear that to control Villers-Bocage, the British would have to occupy the ridge rapidly. The 4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) (4th CLY), with a company of the 1st Battalion Rifle Brigade, was to pass through Villers-Bocage and occupy the highest point of the ridge at Point 213. The 1/7th Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment (West Surrey) would follow up and occupy the town; the 5th Royal Tank Regiment (5th RTR) and a company of the Rifle Brigade were to take high ground at Maisoncelles-Pelvey to the south-west of Villers-Bocage. The 260th Anti-tank Battery of the Norfolk Yeomanry would cover the gap between the 4th CLY and the 5th RTR with 17pdr SP Achilles self-propelled anti-tank guns. The 5th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery (5th RHA), would follow the rest of the brigade group with its Sexton self-propelled guns. The 5th RHA and the brigade group tactical headquarters were established at Amayé-sur-Seulles. The two Hussar regiments were to provide flank protection against the Panzer-Lehr Division and uncover German positions on either side of the line of advance. The 131st Infantry Brigade, with the 1st Royal Tank Regiment (1st RTR) and the 1/5th and 1/6th Queen&#x27;s, was to hold Livry as a firm base.
The &quot;I SS-Panzer Korps&quot; commander &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Sepp Dietrich ordered his only reserve, 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion, to move behind the Panzer-Lehr and 12th SS-Panzer divisions in the Villers-Bocage area, as a precaution against an attempt to advance into the Caumont Gap. The 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion had arrived in Normandy on 12 June, after a five-day drive from Beauvais. The battalion had an establishment of 45 Tiger I, but only about 17 tanks had reached the front by 13 June due to mechanical breakdowns during the drive from Beavais. Some of the support vehicles had also been damaged in an air attack near Versailles. The 1st Company moved to a position north-east of Villers-Bocage, the 2nd Company to just south of Point 213 on the Villers-Bocage ridge and the 3rd trailed near Falaise. The 2nd Company had fourteen tanks, but because of their mechanical unreliability, only six Tigers were present on 13 June. The area around Villers-Bocage came under heavy naval artillery fire during the night of 12/13 June and the 2nd Company moved three times; the company planned a mechanical overhaul for the morning.

==Battle==

===Advance===

During the early hours of 13 June, the 1st Rifle Brigade reconnoitred the first of the route. Livry was reported to be clear of Germans and the advance resumed at 05:30 with the 4th CLY leading the way. The column was met by jubilant French civilians, leading to a relaxed mood among the soldiers. Erroneous information was passed to the British that German tanks were stranded in Tracy-Bocage and rumours held that other tanks were similarly stranded at the Château de Villers-Bocage. On 11 June, German medical personnel had established a hospital at the château but had left at dawn on 13 June; a few German troops remained about the town.

As the column approached Villers-Bocage, the crew of an Sd.Kfz. 231 armoured car watched the British advance and escaped. At 08:30, having covered , the 22nd Armoured Brigade group entered the town to be greeted by celebrating residents; two German soldiers were spotted leaving at high speed in a Volkswagen Kübelwagen. The two Hussar regiments made contact with German forces on either side of the 22nd Brigade group route and the 8th Hussars engaged (eight-wheeler armoured cars). The Hussars reported German tanks heading towards Villers-Bocage but Lieutenant Charles Pearce, of 4th CLY, thought that these were probably self-propelled guns.

===Morning===
With Villers-Bocage occupied, A Squadron 4th CLY motored ahead to Point 213, without reconnaissance, as ordered. A &quot;Kübelwagen&quot; was destroyed and the tanks moved into hull down positions to establish a defensive perimeter. Along the road between the town and the ridge, the personnel carriers of the Rifle Brigade pulled over nose-to-tail, to allow reinforcements for Point 213 to pass. The riflemen dismounted and posted sentries but could see fewer than to either side of the road.

Major Wright, the commanding officer of the 1st Rifle Brigade, called a conference at Point 213 for all officers and the senior NCOs of A Company. It was realised that a shell could kill the company commanders and the half-track occupants were rapidly dispersed among several other vehicles. In Villers-Bocage, Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur, Viscount Cranley, commander of the 4th CLY, expressed concern that his men were &quot;out on a limb&quot; but was assured by Hinde that all was well and was ordered to Point 213, to ensure his men had taken up good defensive positions. Hinde then left Villers-Bocage for his headquarters.

South of Point 213 Wittmann, the commander of the 2nd Company, 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion, was surprised by the British advance through Villers-Bocage,

Wittmann&#x27;s Tiger was spotted at about 09:00 by Sergeant O&#x27;Connor of the Rifle Brigade, who was travelling towards Point 213 in a half-track and broke radio silence to give the only warning the British force received. The Tiger emerged from cover onto Route Nationale 175 and knocked out a Cromwell, the rearmost tank at Point 213. A Sherman Firefly was then knocked out, caught fire and blocked the road. The British at Point 213 were then engaged by the rest of the 2nd Company and lost three more tanks.
Wittmann drove on towards Villers-Bocage. Along the road, the Rifle Brigade troops attempted to reply with PIAT anti-tank weapons and a 6-pounder anti-tank gun; as the Tiger drew closer, panic set in and the riflemen looked for cover. The brigade vehicles were set on fire by machine guns and high-explosive shells but few casualties were suffered. At the east end of Villers-Bocage, Wittmann engaged and knocked out three M3 Stuart light tanks of the 4th CLY Reconnaissance Troop.

In the town, the tanks of the 4th CLY Regimental Headquarters tried to escape but their reverse speed was &quot;painfully slow&quot;; one tank fired two shots before being destroyed by the Tiger. Two tanks reversed off the road into gardens, the 4th CLY Adjutant, Captain Pat Dyas, parked behind a barn; the Tiger drove past a wrecked Stuart towards the centre of town, knocking out another tank and missing Dyas. Lieutenant Charles Pearce took his scout car and warned the rest of the reconnaissance troop in the town centre and Pearce continued westwards to alert B Squadron of the 4th CLY. Wittmann knocked out another Cromwell and on the main street destroyed two artillery observation post (OP) tanks of the 5th RHA, the intelligence officer&#x27;s scout car and the medical officer&#x27;s half-track.
Forty and Taylor wrote that Wittmann was engaged by a Sherman Firefly and withdrew after collapsing a house that contained a German sniper. Bob Moore wrote that he forced Wittmann to retire when a shot from his tank dented the driver visor of the Tiger. Wittmann&#x27;s withdrawal brought him close to Dyas who, having been bypassed, had been stalking the Tiger to fire at its thinner rear armour. The Cromwell shells had no effect and Wittmann destroyed the British tank. Pearce wrote that Wittmann engaged the Cromwell with the Tiger turret reversed. Dyas escaped the tank and was shot at by German infantry in houses along the street. Wittmann drove east to the outskirts of Villers-Bocage and was disabled by a 6-pounder anti-tank gun at the Tilly-sur-Seulles road junction. Wittmann wrote that his tank was disabled by an anti-tank gun in the town centre. In less than 15 minutes, 13 to 14 tanks, two anti-tank guns and 13 to 15 transport vehicles had been destroyed by the 2nd Company, 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion, many by Wittmann. Wittmann and his crew made their way to the Panzer-Lehr Division headquarters at Cháteau d&#x27;Orbois, north of Villers-Bocage.

===Point 213===
Major Werncke of the Panzer-Lehr Division conducted a reconnaissance of Point 213 later in the morning and reconnoitring on foot, discovered a column of unoccupied Cromwell tanks. The tank crews were studying a map with an officer at the front of the column, and Werncke drove one off before the British could react. At the east end of Villers-Bocage, he found a scene of &quot;burning tanks and Bren-gun carriers and dead Tommies&quot; and drove back to the Panzer-Lehr headquarters at Château d&#x27;Orbois. After the ambush on Point 213, A Squadron, 4th CLY had nine tanks operational, including two Fireflies and a Cromwell OP tank, although some were short of crew. There was one rifle section and an equal number of officers. It was decided to hold the position on the ridge until reinforcements arrived and an all round defence was organised. At around 10:00, support and reconnaissance troops of the 4th Company, 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion arrived and began to collect prisoners between the ridge and the town. Some of the British escaped, and about thirty got back to the British lines.

The 1/7th Queen&#x27;s took up defensive positions in Villers-Bocage and captured an advance party of three men from the 2nd Panzer Division. A relief force was prepared to rescue the troops on the ridge, but this plan was rejected by Cranley. At about 10:30, Cranley reported that the position on Point 213 was becoming untenable and withdrawal was impossible. A break-out attempt was planned, and two hours later a Cromwell crew tried to get back to Villers-Bocage by a roundabout route but was knocked out by German tank fire. The Germans shelled the trees along the road, spraying shell and wood splinters, and after five minutes the troops on the ridge surrendered. The British tried to burn their tanks, but German soldiers arrived quickly and took thirty of the CLY prisoner, along with some riflemen and troops of the Royal Horse Artillery. A few men escaped; Captain Christopher Milner of the Rifle Brigade spent the rest of the day on the run and crossed back into the British lines after dark.
Wittmann briefed the Panzer-Lehr Division intelligence officer and was given a Schwimmwagen to return to Point 213. Kauffmann ordered Hauptmann Helmut Ritgen to block the northern exits of the town with 15 Panzer IV, mainly from 6th Company, 2nd Battalion Panzer-Lehr Regiment 130 and ten from a workshop south of Route Nationale 175. Ritgen rendezvoused with the Panzer-Lehr Division commanding officer, Generalleutnant Fritz Bayerlein, at Villy-Bocage. As Ritgen&#x27;s tanks moved towards Villers-Bocage they ran into a British anti-tank gun screen and lost a tank. Four Panzer IVs entered the town from the south and the first two tanks were knocked out; the others withdrew.

In Villers-Bocage, A Company of the 1/7th Queen&#x27;s secured the area around the railway station and B and C companies occupied the east side of the town. German infantry had entered the town and house-to-house fighting began. Two German tanks were damaged and driven off, but the 1/7th Queen&#x27;s infantry companies became mingled and were ordered to fall back to reorganise. A Company was ordered back to the railway station, C Company was assigned the north-eastern edge of the town and D Company the south-eastern edge. B Company was placed in reserve and the battalion anti-tank guns were distributed along the front line. At the town square an ambush was laid by the 4th CLY. A Sherman Firefly, several Cromwells, a 6-pounder anti-tank gun and infantry of the 1/7th Queen&#x27;s with PIATs waited for German tanks to move down the main street. To the west of the town, the Germans attacked the 1/5th Queen&#x27;s near Livry and lost a tank.

===Afternoon===

At around 13:00, tanks of the Panzer-Lehr Division advanced into Villers-Bocage unsupported by infantry. Four Panzer IVs tried to enter from the south near a wrecked Panzer IV and two were knocked out by anti-tank fire. Some Tigers were brought up and silenced the anti-tank position. Rolf Möbius, commander of the 1st Company, divided the primary counter-attack down the main highway through Villers-Bocage and through the southern section of town parallel to the main road, to secure the town centre. The Tigers advanced slowly to intimidate the British into withdrawing and ran into the British ambush. The Firefly opened fire on the lead tank and missed but the anti-tank gun knocked it out. A group of three Tigers split up and drove through the back streets to flank the British; one was engaged by an anti-tank gun and destroyed and the other two were engaged with PIATs, with one being knocked out and the other immobilised.
A fifth Tiger halted on the main street short of the ambush site, apparently waiting for the British to emerge from cover. The Tiger was spotted by the Firefly crew through the windows of a corner building, who reversed to shoot through the windows. The Tiger was hit on the gun mantlet and raced past the side street. A Cromwell advanced onto the main street and fired into the rear of the Tiger, knocking it out and then reversed back into cover. The Firefly knocked out a Panzer IV and during a lull, the disabled tanks were set on fire with blankets and petrol. Outside the town, the 7th Armoured Division brigade group stretched back to Amayé-sur-Seulles and was attacked from the north and south. The attacks were repulsed and at Tracey-Bocage, the 11th Hussars overwhelmed a pocket of resistance.

Under a mortar and artillery bombardment, the Germans attacked A Company 1/7th Queen&#x27;s in the town and a platoon was cut off and captured. Even with the whole of the Queen&#x27;s battalion in the town, the German troops found their way inside. Two grenadier battalions of the 2nd Panzer Division attacked from the south, were engaged by B Squadron 4th CLY and suffered many casualties. Both sides called for artillery support and several British mortars and a carrier were destroyed. By 18:00 the Queen&#x27;s battalion headquarters was threatened and Hinde decided to withdraw before dark made the town untenable. Behind a smoke screen and bombardment by the 5th RHA and V US Corps, the infantry retreated, covered by tanks of the 4th CLY. The Germans harassed the withdrawal with artillery fire and infantry from Tracy-Bocage attacked the British for 2½ hours as they fell back. Though costly to the Germans this continued until around 22:30.

===14 June===

On 14 June, the 22nd Armoured Brigade group formed an all round defensive position, a &quot;brigade box&quot;, in the Amayé-sur-Seulles–Tracy-Bocage–St-Germain area to overlook Villers-Bocage. Supported by the 1st Company, 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion, the Panzer-Lehr Division attacked the brigade box. The 1st US Infantry Division, on the heights around Caumont, opened observed artillery fire, which helped to defeat the first German attack. Later attacks got so close that the artillery could not fire without hitting British positions. A platoon was overrun, and a counter-attack with tanks and infantry then forced the Germans back. The Germans subjected the box to harassing fire and attacked from two sides later in the day with artillery and tanks, which broke into the box and came close to the brigade headquarters before being repulsed. Although confident that the brigade box could be held, the inability of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division to come up prompted the decision to recall the brigade group and straighten the front line.

==Aftermath==

===Casualties===
Contradictory sources make casualty figures difficult to establish. The 22nd Armoured Brigade group suffered around 217 men killed, wounded and missing, many of whom were taken prisoner at Point 213. This figure includes five riflemen who had been captured but were then shot by their guards, apparently for attempting to escape, when they took cover spontaneously in a ditch under American artillery fire. The British lost between more than half of which were on Point 213, where A Squadron, 4th CLY, lost all 15 of its tanks. The Panzer-Lehr Division and the 2nd Panzer Division were in action elsewhere on 13 June and did not count the casualties at Villers-Bocage separate from the day&#x27;s losses. The 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion was only engaged at Villers-Bocage; Taylor gave figures of nine men killed and ten wounded in the 1st Company and one killed and three wounded in the 2nd Company.

Sources differ on the number of German tanks lost, in part because the Panzer-Lehr Division was committed piecemeal, making it impossible to be certain of the number of Panzer IVs knocked out. German tank losses are generally considered to be from six Tigers. Chester Wilmot states that this was a serious loss, as there were only 36 Tiger tanks in Normandy. Taylor wrote that the numbers claimed by the British included tanks that were immobilised and later recovered. Marie named at least nine French civilians who died on 13 June. Six were killed by crossfire or shrapnel during the battle and three by artillery fire just before midnight. Three of the deaths may have been war crimes. More civilians became casualties in the fighting and bombing later. Following the British withdrawal, the town was reoccupied and searched by the Germans; several shops, houses and the town hall were set on fire.

===Bombing and liberation===

During the night of 14/15 June, to cover the withdrawal of the 22nd Armoured Brigade group, 337 Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers (223 Avro Lancasters, 100 Handley Page Halifax and 14 de Havilland Mosquitos from No.4, No.5 and No. 8 Group RAF) dropped of high explosives on the town of Évrecy and on targets around Villers-Bocage, destroying one Tiger tank and damaging three more. No aircraft were lost. Just over two weeks later, at 20:30 on 30 June, Villers-Bocage was bombed again by 266 bombers (151 Lancasters, 105 Halifaxes and 10 Mosquitos from No.3, No.4 and No.8 Group RAF) in support of Operation Epsom, dropping of bombs. Only two aircraft were lost. The town was a vital traffic centre for German forces and though it was hoped that German troops would be caught in the bombing, only French civilians were present at the time. After being severely damaged by the fighting of 13 June and subsequent bombing raids, the town was liberated by a patrol of the 1st Battalion Dorset Regiment, 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, on 4August 1944.

===Command changes===
In early August, up to 100 men, including Bucknall, Erskine, Hinde and other senior officers were sacked and reassigned. Historians largely agree that this was a consequence of the failure at Villers-Bocage and had been planned since the battle. Daniel Taylor is of the opinion that the battle&#x27;s outcome simply provided a convenient excuse and that the sackings took place to &quot;demonstrate that the army command was doing something to counteract the poor public opinion of the conduct of the campaign&quot;.

===Battle honours and awards===
In 1956 and 1957, the British and Commonwealth system of battle honours recognised participation in the Battle of Villers-Bocage by the award to 11 units of the battle honour &quot;Villers Bocage&quot;, for service in expanding the bridgehead from 8–15 June. For his actions at Villers-Bocage, Michael Wittmann was promoted to &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; and awarded Swords to his Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross.

==Analysis==

===Propaganda===
Both sides tried to exploit the Villers-Bocage battle for propaganda. Having escaped from their knocked-out tank, Lieutenant John Cloudsley-Thompson and his crew of the 4th CLY spent much of the day in a basement in Villers-Bocage. After dark, Thompson and the crew were picked up by troops of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division. During debriefing Cloudsley-Thompson said that he &quot;never wished to see another tank as long as [he] lived&quot; but the British press reported this as: &quot;The first thing the five tank men asked for was another tank&quot;. Because the British had lost contact with the forces on Point 213 and withdrawn from Villers-Bocage, they were ignorant of the losses on both sides. The German propaganda machine swiftly credited Wittmann, a household name in Germany, with all the British tanks destroyed at Villers-Bocage.

Wittmann recorded a radio message on the evening of 13 June, describing the battle and claiming that later counter-attacks had destroyed a British armoured regiment and an infantry battalion. Doctored images were produced; three joined-together photographs, published in the German armed forces magazine &quot;Signal&quot;, gave a false impression of the scale of destruction in the town. The propaganda campaign was given credence in Germany and abroad, leaving the British convinced that the Battle of Villers-Bocage had been a disaster when its results were less clear-cut. Schneider, an instructor at the German Bundeswehr tank school and an historian, wrote that the Waffen-SS did not have an &quot;experienced tank arm&quot;, compared to the army panzer divisions. The Waffen-SS may have fought with distinction during the Battle of Kursk but could not match the army&#x27;s success, hence Dietrich&#x27;s attempts to manufacture a hero out of Wittmann.

===Wittmann===

In 2007, Stephen Badsey wrote that Wittmann&#x27;s engagement of the spearhead of the 22nd Armoured Brigade group had overshadowed the period between D-Day and 13 June in historical accounts. Carlo D&#x27;Este wrote that Wittmann&#x27;s attack was &quot;one of the most amazing engagements in the history of armoured warfare&quot;, Max Hastings called it &quot;one of the most devastating single-handed actions of the war&quot; and Antony Beevor wrote that it was &quot;one of the most devastating ambushes in British military history&quot;. Hubert Meyer attributed the failure of Operation Perch to Wittmann&#x27;s &quot;courage, his tactical and technical abilities and [...] the valor, the expertise and the camaraderie of his Panzer crew&quot;. Henri Marie called the attack a &quot;spur of the moment&quot; decision that showed Wittmann&#x27;s quick grasp of the possibility of surprising the British, but described the action as foolhardy and argued that other historians had been carried away by Wittmann&#x27;s ambush; Wittmann lost the first Tiger knocked out in Normandy.

John Buckley attributed the hyperbole about Wittmann to the lingering influence of the German propaganda campaign and criticised D&#x27;Este and Meyer for exaggerating his role and implying that he single-handedly stopped the 7th Armoured Division. Buckley wrote that Russell A Hart&#x27;s claim that Wittmann &quot;all but annihilated&quot; the 7th Armoured Division spearhead was wrong and that &quot;the complete German propaganda treatment&quot; was available from Gary Simpson. Badsey called Wittmann&#x27;s attack and the attention it has received, &quot;remarkable but massively over-written&quot;. In 2013, Buckley wrote that unquestioning regurgitation of Nazi propaganda by writers and historians was inexcusably casual, when a glance at the facts showed that the defeat of the 7th Armoured Division by one Tiger crew led by Wittmann was a myth. Wittmann made a bold attack, which helped to stop the advance of the 4th CLY but did not make a solo effort; the action at Point 213 was led by Rolf Möbius.

===Tactics===
Beevor and Patrick Delaforce have written that the ambush would have been mitigated had it been detected sooner and blame &quot;Erskine&#x27;s failure to provide [a] reconnaissance screen&quot; ahead of the British vanguard as it moved to Point 213. Marie wrote that the British vanguard out-paced the rest of the Brigade group, whose flanks were well protected and advanced with poor information and little intelligence gathering. Milner of the Rifle Brigade wrote that information was not gleaned from the town&#x27;s inhabitants when it should have been, and that had the battalion scout platoon been present, the result of the first engagement may have been different. Milner also wrote that the first attack could have been repulsed had the battalion officers and NCOs been with their men instead of with the O-group on the ridge. Buckley wrote that while Wittmann showed great audacity, the causes of the British defeat were broader and that the British were to blame for the failure at Villers-Bocage, not superior German tanks. Hastings wrote that although the Tiger was &quot;incomparably&quot; more deadly than the Cromwell, the &quot;shambles&quot; caused by the Tigers reflected poorly on the tactics of the British force and that the

Marie noted that Dempsey was disappointed in the lack of tactical flair shown by Brigadier Hinde throughout the battle and that the British should have known better than to attempt an armoured advance unsupported by infantry in the bocage. The British fought an uncoordinated infantry and tank battle during the morning, and the Germans did much the same throughout the day.
Schneider described the contribution of the 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion to the battle as &quot;everything but awe-inspiring&quot;. The Tiger companies and the Panzer-Lehr Division averted a serious British breakthrough but there was no need for the German counter-attack to have been piecemeal. Möbius and the 1st Company were in command of the road to Caen, so Wittmann had time to plan a coordinated attack. Schneider wrote that &quot;a competent tank company commander does not accumulate so many serious mistakes&quot;. By putting the Tigers in a sunken lane overnight, with a vehicle with engine trouble at the head of the column, Wittmann risked blocking the company. Schneider called the advance by Wittmann into the town courageous but that it went &quot;against all the rules&quot;. No intelligence was gathered beforehand and there was no &quot;centre of gravity&quot; or &quot;concentration of forces&quot; in the attack. &quot;The bulk of the 2nd Company and Rolf Möbius&#x27; 1st Company, came up against an enemy who had gone onto the defensive&quot;.

Wittmann&#x27;s &quot;carefree&quot; advance into British-occupied positions was &quot;pure folly&quot; and &quot;such over hastiness was uncalled for&quot;. Had Wittmann properly prepared an assault involving the rest of his company and the 1st Company, there might have been greater results. &quot;[T]houghtlessness of this kind was to cost [Wittmann] his life [in] August... near Gaumesnil, during an attack casually launched in open country with an exposed flank&quot;. Meyer wrote that the 2nd Company advance into the town without infantry support was &quot;obviously inexpedient&quot;. Marie called this a serious tactical error by Möbius but that it was a justifiable risk under the circumstances. Infantry were unavailable and the British could have been expected to still be &quot;under the devastating impression of seeing [their] vanguard totally destroyed in such a short time&quot;.

===British withdrawal===
The British Official Historian, Lionel Ellis, described the 22nd Armoured Brigade group withdrawal and explained that with the unexpected arrival of the 2nd Panzer Division, the 7th Armoured Division &quot;could hardly have achieved full success&quot;. This view was partially supported by the briefing given to 7th Armoured Division commanders prior to the retreat but has gained little support. In 1979, following the disclosure of Ultra, it was revealed that intercepted German communications placed the 2nd Panzer Division at from the front line on 12 June. Ralph Bennett called Montgomery&#x27;s claim that the division &quot;suddenly appeared&quot; disingenuous. Buckley wrote that the order to retreat was given before the 2nd Panzer division arrived in any real strength, and Reynolds wrote that &quot;2nd Panzer&#x27;s tanks were nowhere near Villers-Bocage at this time&quot;. Ellis described the retirement as temporary, as the 7th Armoured Division was to be reinforced with the 33rd Armoured Brigade to renew the offensive towards Évrecy.

David French wrote that the follow-up formations landing in Normandy were on average two days behind schedule and that, had the 33rd Armoured Brigade, the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and the 7th Armoured Division&#x27;s infantry brigade landed on time, XXX Corps might have been able to secure Villers-Bocage before the arrival of substantial German forces. Other historians wrote that substantial British forces remained uncommitted during the battle. Mungo Melvin wrote that although the 7th Armoured Division changed its organisation to a flexible combined arms structure, which was not done by the other British armoured divisions until after Operation Goodwood, neither the 131st Infantry Brigade nor the balanced divisional reserve of an armoured regiment and an infantry battalion were employed well.

Buckley referred to &quot;a reduced armoured brigade, with only limited mobile infantry and artillery support&quot; and doubted it could worry the Germans, and noted that the 151st Infantry Brigade was available in Corps reserve. Hastings was critical of a British failure to concentrate force at the crucial place and time, and referred to the feelings of the &quot;men on the spot&quot; in Villers-Bocage that &quot;a single extra infantry brigade could have been decisive in turning the scale&quot;. D&#x27;Este supported XXX Corps commander Bucknall&#x27;s claim that neither the 151st Infantry Brigade or the 49th Infantry Division could be made ready in time to influence the battle.

===Result===

After the ambush by the 2nd Company, 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion and the loss of Point 213, the 22nd Armoured Brigade group had repulsed every German attack for two days,

Students of the battle have looked to the senior commanders involved to explain the &quot;fumbled failure&quot; at Villers-Bocage. Dempsey remarked after the war that

D&#x27;Este called Dempsey &quot;excessively harsh&quot;, saying that once the town had been abandoned the Brigade group withdrawal was inevitable. Other historians suggest that Bucknall threw away the chance swiftly to capture Caen. Montgomery had been a patron of Bucknall and wrote that his protégé &quot;could not manage a Corps once the battle became mobile&quot;. Buckley wrote that Bucknall was unprepared to support the attack once problems developed and that Erskine was not suited to the task. Wilmot agreed with Dempsey that Bucknall, not the Germans, was to blame for the 7th Armoured Division withdrawal. He further wrote that Bucknall refused to reinforce the division, because he had already decided that its lines of communication were endangered

D&#x27;Este wrote that the failure to unhinge the German front line south of Caen and outflank the I SS Panzer Corps was &quot;one of the costliest Allied mistakes&quot; of the campaign. With the British withdrawal, the chance of mounting a &quot;snap airborne operation&quot; to seize Caen or to deepen the Allied bridgehead had been lost. Wilmot wrote that after the battle, &quot;Caen [could] be taken only by a set-piece assault&quot;. Hastings called Villers-Bocage a &quot;debacle&quot; and the moment which &quot;marked, for the British, the end of the scramble for ground that had continued since D-Day&quot;. Reynolds wrote that the consequences of the battle would be felt in the coming weeks, during the costly attacks needed to drive the Germans from Caen and the surrounding area. The official 7th Armoured Division history called the battle indecisive: &quot;... the brilliant defensive battle of Villers Bocage... although it obliged us to withdraw some seven miles, cost the enemy casualties disproportionate to this gain&quot;. This view is shared by Taylor, who wrote that the battle ended with no clear winner.

<text>The siege of Kut Al Amara (7 December 1915 – 29 April 1916), also known as the first battle of Kut, was the besieging of an 8,000-strong British Army garrison in the town of Kut, south of Baghdad, by the Ottoman Army. In 1915, its population was around 6,500. Following the surrender of the garrison on 29 April 1916, the survivors of the siege were marched to imprisonment at Aleppo, during which many died. Historian Christopher Catherwood has called the siege &quot;the worst defeat of the Allies in World War I&quot;. Ten months later, the British Indian Army, consisting almost entirely of newly recruited troops from Western India, conquered Kut, Baghdad and other regions in between in the fall of Baghdad.

==Prelude==
The 6th (Poona) Division of the Indian Army, under Major-General Charles Townshend, had fallen back to the town of Kut after retreating from Ctesiphon. The British Empire forces arrived at Kut around 3 December 1915. They had suffered significant losses, numbering only 11,000 soldiers (plus cavalry). General Townshend chose to stay and hold the position at Kut instead of continuing the march downriver towards Basra. Contained within a long river loop, Kut offered a good defensive position although supply lines from distant Basra were stretched.

==The siege==
The pursuing Ottoman forces under Halil Pasha arrived on 7 December 1915. Once it became clear the Ottomans had enough forces to lay siege to Kut, Townshend ordered his cavalry to escape south, which it did, led by Lieut. Colonel Gerard Leachman. The Ottoman forces numbered around 11,000 men and were increasing steadily with additional reinforcements arriving constantly. They were commanded by the respected but elderly German general and military historian Baron von der Goltz. Goltz knew the Ottoman army well, as he had spent 12 years working on modernizing it, from 1883 to 1895. After three attacks in December, Goltz directed the building of siege fortifications facing Kut. He prepared for an attack from Basra, using the Tigris River, by building defensive positions further down the river designed to cut off a river-borne relief. The Ottoman XVIII Corps that consisted of the 45th and 51st divisions were assigned to besiege Kut while the XIII Corps that consisted of the 35th and 52nd divisions were assigned down the Tigris river to block any relief force coming up from Basra.

After a month of siege, Townshend wanted to break out and withdraw southwards but his commander, General Sir John Nixon saw value in tying down the Ottoman forces in a siege. Nixon had ordered transports from London, but none had arrived. The War Office was in the process of reorganizing military command; previously the orders had come from the Viceroy and India Office.

However, when Townshend—inaccurately—reported that only one month of food remained, a rescue force was hastily raised. It is not clear why Townshend reported he only had enough food for one month when he actually had food for more than four months (although at a reduced level), but Townshend would not attempt an infantry retreat unprotected through hostile tribal lands without river transport. Nixon had ordered this with reinforcements, commanded by his son, but by December they were still only in the Suez Canal. The confusing communications would prove a critical delay.

Medical facilities in Kut were headed by Major General Patrick Hehir.

===Relief expeditions===
The first relief expedition comprised some 19,000 men under Lieutenant-General Aylmer and it headed up the river from Ali Gharbi in January 1916.
====Battle of Sheikh Sa&#x27;ad====

The first attempt to relieve Kut (the Battle of Sheikh Sa&#x27;ad) came on 6 January by troops under the command of Major-General George Younghusband. Troops under Lieut. Gen. Aylmer&#x27;s command joined the British forces with two brigades the next day following which Aylmer took over the command. Part of the cause of delay was the debate in Cabinet over whether one division would be an adequate force, or whether two divisions should be sent. Deliberations were painfully slow. The ageing General Maurice insisted on being informed at every turn as the evidence came into the Committee of Imperial Defence; which was further complicated by a restructuring involving the setup of a new sub-committee system and transfer of military responsibilities. At least three urgent memoranda were sent from General Nixon demanding transports to evacuate Townshend&#x27;s division. By Christmas his health had broken down, and he requested a return to Bombay.

Nixon&#x27;s replacements with additional staff as a mandatory requirement moved forward from Ali Al Gharbi towards Sheikh Sa&#x27;ad along both banks of the Tigris. Younghusband&#x27;s column made contact with the Ottomans on the morning of 6 January east of Sheikh Sa&#x27;ad. British efforts to defeat the Ottomans were unsuccessful.

The following day, on 7 January, Aylmer arrived with the main body of his forces and ordered a general attack. Younghusband led the attack on the left bank and Major-General Kemball took the right. After heavy fighting all day, Kemball&#x27;s troops had overrun Ottoman trenches on the right bank, taking prisoners and capturing two guns. However, the Ottoman left bank held firm and they carried out supporting manoeuvres from the north.

After little change on 8 January, renewed British attacks on 9 January resulted in the Ottomans retiring from Sheikh Sa&#x27;ad. Over the following two days the Ottomans were followed by Aylmer&#x27;s force but heavy rains made the roads virtually impassable.

====Battle of Wadi====

The Ottomans retreated for about from Sheikh Sa&#x27;ad to a tributary of the Tigris on the left bank known by the Arabic toponym simply as the Wadi (meaning &quot;the river valley&quot;). The Ottomans made their camp beyond the Wadi and on the other side of the Tigris opposite the Wadi.

On 13 January, Aylmer attacked the Ottoman Wadi position on the left bank with all of his forces. After putting up a stiff resistance the Ottomans retreated to the west and they were followed by Aylmer&#x27;s troops.

====Battle of Hanna====

The Ottomans then made their camp upstream of the Wadi at the Hanna defile, a narrow strip of dry land between the Tigris and the Suwaikiya Marshes. British losses at the Battle of Hanna amounted to 2,700 killed and wounded, which was disastrous for the garrison in Kut.

====Siege====
As the siege continued, supplies started to run out for the besieged. Sergeant Munn reported: &quot;About half-way through February the rations were sadly diminishing. Tobacco was first out, and we were smoking anything that would smoke, and green leaves (dried over a fire), tea leaves and sawdust mixed, ginger cut into small lumps. Tea ran out and we had ginger instead (ginger crushed and steeped in boiling water). Milk and sugar had given out long ago, likewise beef and mutton and all the bully was gone with the exception of two days&#x27; emergency rations which kept back until the very last&quot;. Dysentery and scurvy became common.

At the beginning of March 1916, the Ottomans used their Krupp artillery to open a heavy bombardment of Kut, which destroyed much of the town. At the same time, three German aircraft bombed Kut, though the damage inflicted was only slight as compared to the artillery bombardment. At the time, the Ottomans were seen unloading metal cylinders from a barge in the Tigris, which were assumed to contain chemical weapons from Germany. Townshend in his diary called chemical warfare &quot;a cowardly barbarism worthy of Chinese pirates&quot;. As both the garrison and population of Kut began to starve while the Ottoman guns continued to blast Kut, Townshend sent out a series of messages on the radio asking for a promotion from major-general to colonel-general on the account of his success advancing the Tigris in 1915, requests that reflected badly on him.

====Later efforts====
At this point, Khalil Pasha (the Ottoman commander of the whole region) came to the battle, bringing with him a further 20,000 to 30,000 reinforcements.

Following the defeat of Aylmer&#x27;s expedition, General Nixon was replaced as supreme commander by Percy Lake on 19 January. More forces were sent to bolster Aylmer&#x27;s troops. He tried again, attacking the Dujaila redoubt on 8 March. This attack failed, at a cost of 4,000 men. General Aylmer was dismissed and replaced with General George Gorringe on 12 March.

In April, starvation within the British garrison at Kut forced Indian troops to abandon the vegetarian diet of their religion and eat horse meat.

The relief attempt by Gorringe is usually termed the first battle of Kut. The British Empire&#x27;s forces numbered about 30,000 soldiers, roughly equal to the Ottomans. The battle began on 5 April and the British soon captured Fallahiya but with heavy losses, Bait Isa was taken on 17 April. The final effort was against Sannaiyat on 22 April. The Allies were unable to take Sannaiyat and suffered some 1,200 casualties in the process.

In April 1916 No. 30 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps carried out the first air supply operation in history. Food and ammunition were dropped to the defenders of Kut, but &quot;as often as not their parcels go into the Tigris or into the Turkish trenches!&quot; and the food rations provided between the 11 and 29 April were only enough for three days.

All the relief efforts had failed, at a cost of around 30,000 Allied killed or wounded. Ottoman casualties are believed to have been around 10,000. The Ottomans also lost the aid of Baron von der Goltz. He died in April 1916, supposedly of typhoid about a week before the British surrendered on 29 April. After Goltz&#x27;s death, no German commander took his place in Mesopotamia for the rest of the war.

===Surrender of the British army===
British leaders attempted to buy their troops out. Aubrey Herbert and T. E. Lawrence were part of a team of officers sent to negotiate a secret deal with the Ottomans. The British offered £2 million (equivalent to £ million in ) and promised those soldiers would not fight the Ottomans again, in exchange for Townshend&#x27;s troops. Enver Pasha at first pretended to negotiate in good faith, then publicized and rejected the offer as a final humiliation to the British.

The British also asked for help from the Russians. General Nikolai Baratov, with his largely Cossack force of 20,000, was in Persia at the time. Following the request he advanced towards Baghdad in April 1916, but he turned back when news reached him of the surrender.

General Townshend arranged a ceasefire on the 26th and, after failed negotiations, he simply surrendered on 29 April 1916 after a siege of 147 days. Around 13,000 Allied soldiers survived to be made prisoners. The Turkish writer İlber Ortaylı states that &quot;Halil Pasha acted like a gentleman to the surrendering British officers&quot; and offered &quot;to take the POWs up towards the north in river boats in case fuel could be provided from British bases nearby.&quot; The French historian Marc Ferro suggested a different image. According to Ferro, the surrendered British and Indian forces were forced to march around the city of Baghdad while being maltreated by the Ottoman troops supervising their march.

After the surrender, the Ottomans agreed to an exchange of sick and wounded soldiers for an equal number of POWs of the Ottoman Empire that were held by the British. Around 1,500 incapacitated prisoners were exchanged. The Anglo-Indian sick and wounded were taken to hospitals by ships and barges of the Tigris River.

The men of the 6th Division suffered terribly as Ottoman prisoners. On the day of the surrender, the Ottomans handed out biscuits for the POWs. The British historian Russell Braddon wrote that after eating the biscuits &quot;The following morning, they began to die. Frothing at the mouth, their bowels and stomachs disintegrating into a greenish slime, dehydrated and moaning, they died one after the other&quot;. The British and Indian POWs were afflicted by enteritis from contaminated biscuits.

The British historian Paul Knight wrote: &quot;The treatment of the Kuttities was similar to those of the Allied prisoners of war taken by the Japanese, which is of course a far more familiar story to a modern audience. Whether or not there was a deliberate state policy to murder the Kuttities through overwork, underfeeding, or both, or whether murder was a by-produce of negligence, neglect and official incompetence is a moot point. It made little different to the Kuttities. Their captivity took place against the backdrop of the Armenian massacres, which are still denied by the modern Turkish state. Again, whether or not the death of thousands of Armenians was the result of a state policy, or whether it was the by-produce of negligence, neglect and official incompetence is a moot point. It made little difference to the Armenians&quot;. One British POW, Sergeant Long, wrote about the march from Kut to the POW camps in Anatolia: &quot;No words can adequately describe the appalling misery of that scene. Here were men who had suffered and fought the long months of the siege, although they were gradually starved and were not fit to do a day&#x27;s march, yet they were being driven across the pitiless waste under a scorching sun, herded along by a brutal and callous escort of Arab conscripts. Limping and staggering along they all finally arrived, some of them being assisted along by comrades, who themselves were in dire need of assistance&quot;. Other sources say many died en route. The Ottoman guards constantly whipped the POWs to encourage them to move faster. The Indian Muslims were able to bring themselves some protection by saying &quot;Islami, Islami&quot; while the Gurkhas and Sikh POWs were abused for their religions.

After reaching Mosul, the POWs entered into areas where the population was Kurdish while the desert terrain was replaced with the mountains of Anatolia. Long described the Kurds as being more kindly disposed to the POWs than the Arabs, which together the cool summer mountain air made conditions more bearable. At the Ras-el-Ain camp where Indian POWs were being held, Long described the Indians as being in a &quot;...condition that was truly pitiful they resembled animated skeletons hung about with filthy rags. No tents or other shelter had been provided and they were living in holes in the grounds like pariah dogs&quot;.

Townshend himself was taken to the island of Heybeliada on the Sea of Marmara, to sit out the war in relative luxury. The author Norman Dixon, in his book &quot;On the Psychology of Military Incompetence&quot;, described Townshend as being &quot;amused&quot; by the plight of the men he had deserted, as if he had pulled off some clever trick. Dixon says Townshend was unable to understand why his friends and comrades were ultimately censorious over his behaviour.

In British Army battle honours, the siege of Kut is named as &quot;Defence of Kut Al Amara&quot;.

==Aftermath==
Jan Morris, a British historian, described the loss of Kut as &quot;the most abject capitulation in Britain&#x27;s military history.&quot; After this humiliating loss, General Lake and General Gorringe were removed from command. The new commander was General Maude, who trained and organized his army and then launched a successful campaign.

Ten months after the siege of Kut, the British Indian Army conquered the whole region from Kut to Baghdad as part of the fall of Baghdad on 11 March 1917. With Baghdad captured, the British administration undertook vital reconstruction of the war-torn country and Kut was slowly rebuilt.

Some of the Indian prisoners of war from Kut later came to join the Ottoman Indian Volunteer Corps under the influence of Deobandis of the Silk Letter Movement and with the encouragement of the German High Command. These soldiers, along with those recruited from the prisoners from the European battlefields, fought alongside Ottoman forces on a number of fronts. The Indians were led by Amba Prasad Sufi, who during the war was joined by Kedar Nath Sondhi, Rishikesh Letha, and Amin Chaudhry. These Indian troops were involved in the capture of the frontier city of Karman and the detention of the British consul there, and they also successfully harassed Sir Percy Sykes&#x27; Persian campaign against the Baluchi and Persian tribal chiefs who were aided by the Germans.

<doc id="204532" wikidata="Q1093313" url="?curid=204532" title="Citadelle of Quebec">
<text>The Citadelle of Quebec (), also known as , is an active military installation and the secondary official residence of the governor general of Canada. It is atop Cap Diamant, adjoining the Plains of Abraham in Quebec City, Quebec. The citadel forms part of the fortifications of Quebec City, which is one of only two cities in North America still surrounded by fortifications, the other being Campeche, Mexico.

The strategic importance of Cap Diamant was recognized by the French as early as 1608. Several defensive fortifications were built on the site first by the French and then by the British after their conquest of New France. The modern citadel was built from 1820 to 1850, in an effort to secure Quebec City against a potential American attack. The British used the citadel until 1871, when they formally handed the property over to the Canadian government. Following the handover, the citadel was used as a military installation by the Canadian Armed Forces and as a royal and vice-regal residence.

The Citadelle is a National Historic Site of Canada and forms part of the Fortifications of Québec National Historic Site of Canada. The fortress is located within the Historic District of Old Québec, which was designated a World Heritage Site in 1985. The site receives some 200,000 visitors annually.

==History==
Cap Diamant&#x27;s strategic value was identified by Samuel de Champlain in 1608 and led him to found Quebec City at the base of the escarpment. The promontory was practically insurmountable and thus the only side of the settlement ever to be heavily fortified was the west, the only one not naturally protected by the hill.

===Early fortifications===
====French-rule====
The first protective wall (&quot;enceinte&quot;)—Major Provost&#x27;s palisade—was built by command of Governor General of New France Louis de Buade, sieur de Frontenac and completed just in time for the Battle of Quebec in 1690. Three years later, a plan by engineer Josué Boisberthelot de Beaucours for new, wide &quot;enceinte&quot; was developed by the French military engineer Jacques Levasseur de Néré and approved in 1701 by King Louis XIV&#x27;s Commissary General of Fortifications, Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban.

The proposal to build a full fort was deemed by the government in France to be too costly, despite both the importance and vulnerability of Quebec City. After the fall of Louisbourg in 1745, considerable work on the battlements took place under the direction of military engineer Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de Léry.

====British-rule====
The first British lieutenant governor of Quebec, General James Murray, saw the weakness of Quebec City&#x27;s defences (indeed, Murray&#x27;s post existed precisely because the British had conquered Quebec City four years before Murray&#x27;s appointment as governor in 1763). He urged the construction of a citadel, but the imperial government at Westminster, like the French before, deemed a large fort to be of little value; a smaller, wooden citadel was built. 

During the American Revolutionary War, after seizing Montreal in the autumn of 1775, American rebels, led by General Richard Montgomery and Benedict Arnold, attempted to take Quebec on 31 December. There, Montgomery was killed and Arnold wounded and forced to retreat. The Americans attempted to keep Quebec under siege, but withdrew after the arrival of British reinforcements in the spring of 1776.

===Present fortification===
As tensions between the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as fears of further rebellion in British North America, grew in the late 18th century, the British reinforced the defences of their colonies according to a plan drawn up in the 1790s by Gother Mann. The ramparts around the Upper Town cliff and four martello towers (still extant) on the Plains of Abraham were completed before 1812. A citadel was a key part of Mann&#x27;s design, but no fort was built because the cost was deemed prohibitive.

That opinion finally shifted following the War of 1812; as part of a wider improvement of Canada&#x27;s defences coordinated by the Duke of Richmond, then Governor-in-Chief of British North America, the existing star fort was built between 1820 and 1850 under the direction of Lieutenant-Colonel Elias Walker Durnford of the Royal Engineers. Intended to secure Quebec City against the Americans and serve as a refuge for the British garrison in the event of attack or rebellion, the Citadelle incorporated a section of the French &quot;enceinte&quot; of 1745 and the layout was based on Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban&#x27;s design for an arms, munitions, and supplies depot, as well as a barracks. That, though, was somewhat of an anachronism by the time of the fort&#x27;s completion, in comparison to other contemporary European military architecture. Additional buildings were completed in 1850.

After Canadian Confederation in 1867, Canada became responsible for its own defence; the British departed the Citadelle in 1871. Two batteries of the Royal Canadian Artillery were established at the Citadelle and an artillery school was opened in 1871, followed by a cavalry school. From the late 19th century, living conditions for soldiers at the fort gradually improved; canteens were opened and the casemates were made more comfortable. The preservation of much of the fortifications and defences of Quebec is due to the intervention of Governor General of Canada the Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, who also established the Citadelle as a viceregal residence in 1872, reviving a tradition dating to the founding of New France. Since 1920, the Citadelle has been the home station of the Royal 22e Régiment of the Canadian Forces.

The Quebec Conferences of 1943 and 1944, in which Governor General of Canada the Earl of Athlone, Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed strategy for World War II, were held at the Citadelle of Quebec.

The Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada designated the Citadel as a national historic site in 1946. The fortress was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1980 and, five years later, the Historic District of Old Québec, of which the Citadelle is a part, was placed on UNESCO&#x27;s list of World Heritage Sites.

==Function==
The Citadelle is a functioning military installation for the Canadian Armed Forces, as well as an official residence of both Canada&#x27;s monarch and its governor general. The latter, by tradition, resides there for several weeks during the summer as well as other shorter periods throughout the year. As is done at the other federal royal residence, Rideau Hall in Ottawa, Canadian award presentations and investitures and ceremonies for both incoming and outgoing ambassadors and high commissioners to Canada are held at the Citadelle. The residence is also open to the public, running a visitors&#x27; program and free tours of the state rooms throughout the year as well as educational tours for students. The Citadelle attracts approximately 200,000 visitors each year.

Building 1 of the Citadelle is used as the staff headquarters for the Royal 22e Régiment. Several military ceremonies related to the regiment also take place at the Citadelle&#x27;s parade ground, such as the changing of the guard and of battalion command and the consecration of each successive Batisse the Goat as regimental mascot.

A cannon is fired from the fort daily at noon as a time signal. It can be heard throughout Quebec City. Originally, two guns were fired each day, at noon to alert Quebec City residents of the lunch hour and the Angelus or noon-day prayer, and at 9:30 pm, marking the curfew for soldiers in the city. The tradition has continued since 1871, save for between 1994 and 2008.

==Buildings==

The fort is an uneven star shaped citadel and comprises four bastions and three straight curtain walls, all constructed with locally quarried sandstone. Within its walls are 24 buildings constructed mostly of grey cut stone.

===Royal and viceregal residence===
The Officer&#x27;s Barracks, a neo-Norman structure built in 1831 by the British Army, has been a residence of the governor general of Canada since 1872. The residence today has a total of 153 rooms over , including offices for the governor general&#x27;s secretary.

The entrance into the original area of the residence is through a set of double doors beneath a neo-classical porch bearing the words &quot;GOUVERNEUR GÉNÉRAL&quot; on the frieze and the crest of the Royal Arms of Canada in the tympanum. Within is a foyer with marble tile floor, a stair descending to the basement, and, through another set of doors in a screen with translucent leaded glass sidelights and fanlight, is a hall; both rooms are in the Georgian style, in beige, cream, and gold. The Small Dining Room is similarly Georgian in decor, with robin&#x27;s egg blue walls and white-painted trim. From the ceiling hang two crystal chandeliers.

Soon after the building became a royal residence, additions to accommodate the viceregal party and household were required, including a ballroom and sunroom. These, however, were, on 2 February 1976, destroyed by fire and the other rooms of the residence suffered smoke and water damage. The Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada (which oversees the infrastructure of the Citadelle) restored the original wing and new state rooms were built in place of the lost post-1872 additions, the work being completed in 1984.

This new wing was built at the east end of and at a slight angle to the 1831 structure, the roof being copper and the exterior walls of the same masonry as the adjacent buildings, but, using more regulated block sizes and a flatter relief of pilasters and windows, as well as less detailing overall. The wing contains a separate entrance and ceremonial foyer with twin spiral staircases ascending to a piano nobile; the stairs have wood handrails with aluminum pickets and between, the flights, is a niche for sculpture. On the upper level are an event space, lounge, and sunroom with a terrace overlooking the St. Lawrence River. The former two areas are fully barrel vaulted and linked together by a continuous, narrow skylight, under which crystal pendants of different lengths hang and transfer the natural light into the rooms. Interiors of the modern addition were designed by Quebec artist Madeleine Arbour, who was inspired by the colours of winter in Quebec, and use Canadian materials, including granite, walnut, and aluminum. The residence is furnished with pieces from the Crown Collection, mostly in New France style, antique furniture mixed with contemporary Canadian art.

===Royal 22e Régiment Museum===

Building 15, constructed in 1750, also known as the powder magazine, houses the Museum of the Royal 22e Régiment and Canadian Forces Museum, which collects, preserves, and displays artifacts of Canadian military historical significance, as well as the Museum, which features weapons, uniforms, and other military artifacts of the Royal 22e Régiment. The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, OMMC and Virtual Museum of Canada.

===Other buildings===
Building 1, the Former Hospital Administration Building, is the principal structure in Mann&#x27;s Bastion. It is a two-story, rectangular, symmetrical stone structure with a hipped-roof pierced by two brick chimneys. The west-facing facade features restrained decorative detailing of pilasters supporting a flat cornice along the length of the five-bay façade. Loopholes are visible on the second floor on both sides of the building. The rear elevation facing into the bastion is functional and plain in appearance.

Building 2, also known as the Men&#x27;s Barracks, was formerly the armory and powder magazine. It faces the parade ground near the throat of the Prince of Wales Bastion. It is a long, rectangular, two story masonry building built of smooth limestone with a hipped roof clad in sheet copper. The main façade of the building has little ornamentation and is regulated and orderly, with small, regularly placed, multi-paned windows.

Building 5, the Former Powder Magazine, is a low, rectangular stone structure with a gabled roof and a surrounding protective blast wall. Two doors at ground level and three openings at gable level pierce the symmetrical façade. Along the plain side elevations are three half-barrel-vaulted passages, or traverses, two on the west and one on the east.

Building 7, also known as the Memorial Building, forms part of a complex of three structures, which includes a chapel and a workshop, situated near the parade ground. They are attached by a 19th-century protective wall. It is a small, rectangular, one-story masonry edifice with a pyramidal stone roof and a row of windows on all four elevations. Its principal façade is distinguished by a modern porchway. Governor General Georges Vanier and his wife Pauline Vanier are interred here at the commemorative chapel.

Located within the King&#x27;s Bastion and adjacent to the governor general&#x27;s residence, Building 10 is the former military prison and presently the museum annex. Constructed in 1842, it is a two-story rectangular stone structure with a hipped roof pierced by three brick chimneys. The west elevation facing the citadel is restrained but decorated by pilasters. Loopholes pierce the walls on both stories. There are several irregularly placed windows with iron bars.

Building 14, the former ordnance store, stands along the parade ground. The long, rectangular two story structure is constructed of stone with a hipped roof clad in copper sheet. The symmetrical façade features small, evenly spaced windows.

Building 16 is the museum office and former cooperage.

Building 17, also known as the Men&#x27;s Barracks, stands on the south side of the parade ground near the throat of the Dalhousie Bastion. Two stories high for most of its length, the rectangular building has exterior walls of stone and features symmetrical elevations, a hipped, copper clad roof, and a projecting course of stone above the ground floor.

Clearly seen from the river and aligned on the meridian for observation purposes, Building 20, also known as the Ball House, is the former observatory and time ball tower. It is a compact, tall, two story stone structure of several architectural shapes. The rectangular section with a gabled roof was the former observatory and the square section formerly housed the time ball installation topped with an antenna. The building is entered from the ground floor of its small porch, which joins the two buildings.

Building 32, formerly the Defensive Guard House, is located at the eastern end of the north main ditch below the King&#x27;s Bastion. It is a small, squat, one story masonry edifice with a gable roof supported by wood rafters. A chimney rises through the roof, which is covered in painted tin sheeting.

The former caponier, Building 46, is located at the south end of the ditch separating the counterscarp from the Men&#x27;s Barracks. Its two walls and small turret in the middle of its gabled roof are the only visible elements of this small stone building. It is integrated with the ramparts and pierced with loopholes.

<text>James Gall (27 September 1808 – 7 February 1895) was a Scottish clergyman who founded the Carrubbers Close Mission. He was also a cartographer, publisher, sculptor, astronomer and author. In cartography he gives his name to three different map projections: Gall stereographic; Gall isographic; and Gall orthographic (Gall–Peters projection).

==Life==

Gall was born on 27 September 1808, the son of Ann Collie and James Gall, a printer who founded the printing company of Gall &amp; Inglis in Edinburgh, which specialised in easy-access astronomy. His uncle, John Gall, ran a coach-building business. He was baptised at St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church, Edinburgh on 15 October 1808. He lived with his family at Potterrow on the South Side of Edinburgh. 

He was educated at the High School close to his home and at the Trustees Academy. He was then apprenticed as a printer in his father&#x27;s firm from 1822 before studying at the University of Edinburgh. From 1838 he became a partner in his father&#x27;s publishing firm, which specialised in maps.

In 1849, aged 41, he decided to retrain as a Free Church minister and studied at New College, Edinburgh graduating in 1855. His first role was in the establishment of a mission at Carrubbers Close on the Royal Mile.

At this time he was still a partner in Gall &amp; Inglis. He was living at Myrtle Bank in Trinity, Edinburgh.

In 1858 he was chosen to minister at the new Free Church in the Canongate, holding the overspill from the growing mission work at Carrubbers Close. This originally held services in a hall at Moray House until a building was completed in 1862. This stood on Holyrood Road on the Site now occupied by the main Moray College building. It was later named the Moray Free Church. He lived adjacent to the church at 10 St John Street. He resigned from the church in 1872 to concentrate on mission work. His place at the Moray Church was filled by Rev Walter Glendinning. He lost his manse at John Street as a result of this decision, and lived for a while thereafter at a flat at 47 Forrest Road.

He died at home, 35 Newington Road in Edinburgh on 7 February 1895. He is buried in the north-east section of Grange Cemetery in Edinburgh, nearby his father. His funeral took place on 11 February 1895 and was attended by over 600 of his many admirers.

== Religious views ==

Most of Gall&#x27;s work on religion was detailed in a book called &quot;The Stars and the Angels,&quot; (1858) in which he not only argues for the existence of other inhabited planets, but describes the view that Gabriel would have had on his way from heaven to earth to tell Mary that she would have a baby next Christmas.

A rare, but important, work by Gall is &quot;The Synagogue Not the Temple, the Germ and Model of the Christian Church&quot;, published in 1890. It discusses the foundation upon which the Christian Church is modelled.

Gall in &quot;Primeeval Man Unveiled: or The Anthropology of the Bible,&quot; writes that &quot;[t]he Bible narrative does not commence with creation, as is commonly supposed, but with the formation of Adam and Eve, millions of years after our planet had been created. Its previous history, so far as Scripture is concerned, is yet unwritten. There may have been not one, but twenty different races upon the earth before the time of Adam, just as there may be twenty different races of men on other worlds ... &quot;

== Astronomy ==

Gall&#x27;s main work as an astronomer was with the constellations. As part of this work he developed the Gall orthographic projection, a derivative of the Lambert cylindrical equal-area projection, to project the celestial sphere onto flat paper in a manner that avoided distorting the shapes of the constellations. He also applied this technique to terrestrial mapmaking as a way to make a flat map of the round Earth. Gall Orthographic was re-invented by Arno Peters in 1967 and adopted by organisations such as UNESCO. In recognition of both men the form is now called the Gall-Peters projection.

Gall himself was an advocate of accessible mapping for blind people. One format he suggested was to combine Braille printing with twine to indicate lines. An 1851 book included such a map by Gall and his partner Inglis. It used raised borders to indicate county boundaries and other features.

==Family==

Gall&#x27;s father, James Gall (1784–1874), designed a &quot;triangular alphabet&quot; used for embossed books for blind people and was instrumental in founding the Royal Blind School in Edinburgh. He was also the principal creator of the Scottish Sunday School system.

In 1833 Gall married Mary Campbell from Belfast (1810-1866). Their eldest son, James Gall (b.1834) became a businessman in Jamaica. Their daughter, Elizabeth (&quot;Eliza&quot;) Walkingshaw Gall (1835-1912), married Robert Inglis, the son of James Gall&#x27;s business partner, who then inherited the printing company of Gall &amp; Inglis on James&#x27;s death. Robert&#x27;s son, James Gall Inglis FRSE (1865–1939) was also a keen astronomer and came to the firm in 1880. He is buried with James Gall. Anna Gall (1838-1929) died a spinster.

<text>Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Stanley Maude KCB CMG DSO (24 June 1864 – 18 November 1917) was a British Army officer. He is known for his operations in the Mesopotamian campaign during the First World War and for conquering Baghdad in 1917.

==Early life==
Maude was born in Gibraltar, the youngest son of General Sir Frederick Francis Maude, who had been awarded the Victoria Cross in 1855 during the Crimean War, and of Catherine Mary, &quot;née&quot; Bisshopp, daughter of Very Reverend Sir George Bisshopp, 9th Baronet, Dean of Lismore. The Maude family claimed descent from Eustace de Montaut, who came over to England during the Norman Conquest.

Maude attended St Michael&#x27;s School, Aldis House, Slough, and Eton College, where he was elected to Pop. After attending a crammer, he entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He graduated in 1883 and was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards in February 1884.

==Early service==
Maude first saw active service in Egypt from March to September 1885, where he was awarded the Egyptian Medal and the Khedive&#x27;s Egyptian Star. In March 1888 he was appointed an adjutant. While attending the Staff College, Camberley from 1895 to 1896, he was promoted to captain on 28 August 1895.

He was promoted again, this time to major, on 5 February 1899, and next saw service during the Second Boer War, where he served from January 1900 to March 1901; and for which he was mentioned in dispatches (10 September 1901), was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and received the Queen&#x27;s South Africa Medal.

In May 1901, he was appointed military secretary to the Earl of Minto, Governor-General of Canada, in which capacity he accompanied the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary) on their Royal Tour of Canada in September and October 1901. During this trip Maude joined the Duke of York and Lord Minto on a duck hunt at Delta Marsh, Manitoba, and for his services administering the tour he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in October 1901. He served on the staff of the Governor-General until Lord Minto stepped down in 1904, when he returned to Britain to become second-in-command at the Coldstream Guards. He then joined the general staff, was promoted to lieutenant colonel in June 1907 and colonel in July 1911, by which time he was serving at the War Office in London as an assistant director.

==First World War==
===Western Front===
In World War I, Maude first served in France. He was a staff officer with III Corps when, in October 1914, he was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier general and given command of the 14th Infantry Brigade, part of the 5th Division, in place of Brigadier General Stuart Peter Rolt. He was wounded in April 1915 and returned home to recover.

He returned to France in May and, in June, he was promoted to major general and transferred to command the 33rd Division, a Kitchener&#x27;s Army formation which was then still in training in Britain.

===Dardanelles===
In mid-August, however, Maude was instead given charge of the 13th (Western) Division in Suvla. The 13th suffered heavy casualties retreating from Suvla and landing and later evacuating from Helles before being shifted to Mesopotamia in March 1916. He was the last man evacuated from Suvla Bay.

===Mesopotamia===
Maude arrived to catch the end of the British failure at the Siege of Kut where he was promoted to temporary lieutenant general, replacing Lieutenant General G. F. Gorringe as commander of the newly dubbed Tigris Corps (III Indian Army Corps) in July 1916. Despite being instructed to do no more than hold the existing line, Maude set about to re-organising and re-supplying his mixed British and Indian forces. He was made commander of all Allied forces in Mesopotamia in late July 1916, replacing Sir Percy Lake.

Further advances in Mesopotamia were ordered (18 September 1916) by politicians such as Curzon and Chamberlain and against the wishes of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) General &quot;Wully&quot; Robertson. Basil Liddell Hart later argued that Maude clearly &quot;consciously or unconsciously&quot; ignored his secret orders from Robertson not to attempt to take Baghdad. Robertson changed his mind when it seemed that the Russians might advance to Mosul, removing any Turkish threat to Mesopotamia, and authorised Maude to attack in December 1916.

Given reinforcements and more equipment, Maude directed his force in a steady series of victories. Advancing up the Tigris and winning the battles of Mohammed Abdul Hassan, Hai and Dahra in January 1917, recapturing Kut in February 1917, he took Baghdad on 11 March 1917, shortly after his rank of lieutenant-general had been made permanent, &quot;in recognition of his distinguished service in the field as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in Mesopotamia&quot;. (He issued the Proclamation of Baghdad on 19 March.) From Baghdad, he launched the Samarrah Offensive and extended his operations to the Euphrates and Diyala rivers.

==Death==

After a lull over the summer, in November 1917, whilst his forces were engaged at Ramadi and Tikrit, Maude contracted cholera (which some sources claim to have been caught from drinking &quot;unboiled&quot; milk) and died in the same house as German field marshal von der Goltz nineteen months earlier. Lieutenant General W. R. Marshall succeeded him.

His body was buried in Baghdad (North Gate) War Cemetery. His initial grave and marker was replaced by a more elaborate structure and then enclosed in a small mausoleum structure on the walls of which is mounted the standard Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone. The epitaph on his CWGC gravestone reads: &quot;&#x27;I am the resurrection and the life&#x27;. He fought a good fight. He kept the faith.&quot; In March 1918 parliament agreed to a request from the King that he grant the sum of £25,000 to his widow.

==Memorials==

Maude has a memorial stone at Brompton Cemetery in London. An equestrian statue of him was unveiled in December 1923 in Baghdad. The statue was by William Goscombe John and the pedestal by Edward Warren. It was unveiled by Sir Henry Dobbs, the High Commissioner to Iraq, in the presence of King Feisal, Air Marshal Sir John Salmond and many others, including the French and American consuls. The statue was attacked and torn down by an anti-British mob during the Iraqi Republican Revolution of 1958, its subsequent fate is unknown.

Mount Maude, a peak in the Cascade Range, was named for Frederick Maude by Albert H. Sylvester.

<doc id="204536" wikidata="Q1369039" url="?curid=204536" title="USS Constellation (CV-64)">
<text>USS &quot;Constellation&quot; (CVA-64/CV-64) was a supercarrier and the third ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the &quot;new constellation of stars&quot; on the flag of the United States. One of the fastest ships in the Navy, as proven by her victory during a battlegroup race held in 1985, she was nicknamed &quot;Connie&quot; by her crew and officially as &quot;America&#x27;s Flagship&quot;.

The contract to build &quot;Constellation&quot; was awarded to the New York Naval Shipyard on 1 July 1956, and her keel was laid down 14 September 1957 at the New York Navy Yard. She was christened and launched 8 October 1960, sponsored by Mary Herter (wife of Secretary of State Christian Herter). &quot;Constellation&quot; was delivered to the Navy 1 October 1961, and commissioned on 27 October 1961, with Captain T. J. Walker in command. At that time, she had cost about US$264.5 million. &quot;Constellation&quot; was the last conventional U.S. aircraft carrier (as of January 2021) to be built at a yard other than Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Company. &quot;Constellation&quot; was scrapped at Brownsville, Texas, in 2015–2017.

== History ==
The keel of &quot;Constellation&quot; was laid down at New York Naval Shipyard in 1957.

===Fire during construction===
USS &quot;Constellation&quot; was heavily damaged by fire while under construction on 19 December 1960. The carrier was in the final stages of construction at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York when the fire began.

The fire broke out when a forklift operating on the hangar deck accidentally pushed its cargo into a steel plate knocking it over. The plate then broke off the plug of a tank of diesel fuel which spilled from the container reaching the lower levels of the ship. The fuel was ignited perhaps by a cutting torch of a fitter, and then moved to a wooden scaffolding. The flames spread quickly, filling the passageways of the ship with smoke. A Navy commander commented on the nature of the ship&#x27;s design at an inquiry, &quot;Ships of this class are the most complex structures ever designed by man.&quot;

It took 17 hours for firefighters to extinguish the fire, some of whom had been &quot;driven to the raw edge of exhaustion&quot; after being called into service in the Park Slope air accident. The firefighters saved hundreds of lives without losing any of their own; however, 50 shipyard workers were killed. The extensive damage cost $75 million to repair, and delayed the commissioning date by seven months, leading to a rumor that the ship that had burned in New York was and the fire caused the Navy to change the names and hull number designations between the two sister ships that were being built simultaneously in separate shipyards in separate states. An abstract of a &quot;New York Times&quot; article from the day after the fire, 20 December 1960, refers to the ship as USS &quot;Constellation&quot;.

=== 1960–1969 ===
&quot;Constellation&quot; was launched 8 October 1960, and she was delivered to the Navy 1 October 1961. She was commissioned on 27 October 1961, with Captain T. J. Walker in command. Another fire occurred aboard &quot;Constellation&quot; on 7 November 1961, while she was being tested at sea, killing four and injuring nine others.

Following fitting out and acceptance trials, &quot;Constellation&quot; departed her home port of Norfolk, Virginia, on 7 February 1962 for initial air operations off the Virginia Capes. She conducted her first catapult launch and arrested landing the same day with Commander George C. Watkins, air group (CVG) 13 commander, at the controls of an A4D-2 Skyhawk of Attack Squadron 34. After a month of operating locally, &quot;Connie&quot; (as the carrier became known) conducted a two-month shakedown cruise in the Caribbean Sea.

In summer 1962, &quot;Constellation&quot; was transferred to the U.S. Pacific Fleet and CVG-13 was disestablished. For the two-month trip around Cape Horn to her new home port of San Diego, California, &quot;Constellation&quot; embarked elements of CVG-5 and departed Mayport, Florida, on 25 July. In November &quot;Constellation&quot;, with CVG-14 on board, commenced workup exercises for her upcoming maiden deployment to the western Pacific as a component of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. The uneventful cruise took place from February to September 1963.

&quot;Constellation&quot;″s second deployment began on 5 May 1964. She relieved &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; on station in the Gulf of Tonkin off Vietnam on 8 June, embarked Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 14 (air groups had been redesignated air wings on 20 December 1963) and flew armed photo reconnaissance missions over Laos until 13 July. Following an upkeep period at Subic Bay, Philippines, &quot;Constellation&quot; reached Hong Kong for a port visit on 27 July, but within a few days was called back into action.

As a result of orders received during the first day of the Gulf of Tonkin Incident (2 August 1964), &quot;Constellation&quot; got underway and headed toward the Gulf of Tonkin. On 4 August, &quot;Constellation&quot; launched F-4B Phantom IIs to join aircraft from in providing air cover over the destroyers which were alleged by the Johnson administration to have been attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats. On 5 August both carriers launched Operation Pierce Arrow, a series of air strikes on a North Vietnamese oil facility and naval vessels. CVW-14 lost two aircraft, an A-1 Skyraider, piloted by Lieutenant (junior grade) Richard C. Sather, who was killed in action (KIA), and an A-4 Skyhawk flown by Lieutenant (junior grade) Everett Alvarez Jr., who became one of the United States&#x27; first prisoners of war (POW) of the Vietnam War. Operations returned to a more normal cycle for the remainder of the deployment, and &quot;Constellation&quot; returned to San Diego on 1 February 1965, ending a nearly nine-month cruise. &quot;Connie&quot; and CVW-14 were awarded a Navy Unit Commendation (NUC) for the early August operations. During the deployment, &quot;Constellation&quot; appears to have been under the direction of Commander Carrier Division 9.

A first shipyard period for &quot;Constellation&quot; followed, lasting eight months; then workups commenced for her first full-blown war cruise. The carrier, with CVW-15 on board, was underway for operations off Vietnam in May 1966. During 111 days on station, aircraft from &quot;Constellation&quot; pounded roads, bridges and other targets, attempting to impede the flow of men and war materials south. The F-4B aircrew of pilot Lieutenant William M. McGunigan and radar intercept officer Lieutenant (junior grade) Robert M. Fowler from Fighter Squadron 161 (VF-161) shot down a MiG-17 fighter jet on 13 July, marking the ship’s first MiG kill of the war. &quot;Constellation&quot; returned to San Diego in December after her seven-month combat cruise, having lost 16 aircrewmen and 15 aircraft. Subsequently, both &quot;Constellation&quot; and CVW-15 were awarded a NUC for this deployment.

After a short workup cycle, &quot;Constellation&quot;″s third combat deployment commenced in April 1967. With CVW-14 embarked, the carrier operated first on Dixie Station (a patrol area about off South Vietnam) with strikes in the Iron Triangle region, and then moved north to Yankee Station (a patrol area about off North Vietnam) for a total of 121 days on the line. Reflecting the intensive nature of air operations, F-4Bs of VF 142 and VF 143 accounted for four MiG kills. The eight-month deployment ended in December, having totaled losses of 16 aircraft and 20 personnel, including seven KIAs and eight POWs. Both the carrier and CVW-14 received a NUC.

&quot;Constellation&quot; began her fourth deployment to the western Pacific and Vietnam on 29 May 1968. During this deployment, the &quot;Constellation&quot;/CVW-14 team was restricted to strikes below the 20th parallel of North Vietnam as a result of a March Presidential order. On 1 November, as directed by President Johnson, all bombing of North Vietnam was halted at 21:00 Saigon time. The last Navy mission over the restricted area was flown earlier in the day by Cmdr. Kenneth E. Enney in an A-7 Corsair II. &quot;Constellation&quot; returned to homeport to on 31 January 1969, after flying more than 11,000 combat and support missions and dropping almost 20,000 tons of ordnance. Fifteen aircraft were destroyed, nine due to enemy action. Six aircrew members perished, five were listed as KIAs and three were taken as POW.

By August, it was time for &quot;Constellation&quot; to return to Vietnam for a fifth combat deployment, again with CVW-14. Following an initial 20-day period of supporting strikes in South Vietnam as well as Laos, &quot;Constellation&quot; sailed to Defender Station in the Sea of Japan, which had been created as a result of increased tensions on the Korean Peninsula. On 2 October 1969, there was an accident caused when the tail rotor came off of a helicopter just before landing on the flight deck. Nine men went down with the chopper and were never recovered. A return to Yankee Station on 1 November also produced a major milestone in the carrier&#x27;s life when the F-4J aircrew of air wing skipper Commander R. K. Billings and Lieutenant (junior grade) Jeff Taylor of VF-143 conducted &quot;Connie&quot;″s 100,000th arrested landing. During a mission on 28 March 1970, the VF-142 F-4 crew of Lieutenant Jerome E. Beaulier and Lieutenant Steven J. Barkley downed a North Vietnamese MiG-21 jet fighter. Following a total of 128 days on the line, &quot;Constellation&quot;″s nine-month deployment ended in May, with CVW-14 suffering the loss of seven total aircraft, five to enemy action. One member of the aircrew was taken as a POW, but there were no fatalities.

=== 1970–1979 ===
Upon her return &quot;Constellation&quot; began a nine-month major shipyard overhaul, her second since commissioning. In spring 1971 she welcomed aboard a new air wing, CVW-9, and departed San Diego on 1 October for what would become a historic combat deployment. Air operations commenced with strikes against mainly logistic targets in Laos as well as reconnaissance missions over North Vietnam into 1972. On 19 January, the VF-96 F-4 Phantom crew of Lieutenant Randall H. &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham and Lieutenant (junior grade) William P. Driscoll scored a kill against a MiG-21, the first for a Navy aircraft since &quot;Connie&quot;″s VF-142 kill on 28 March 1970. The carrier was nearing the end of her scheduled deployment when her tour was extended to meet the threat posed by the North Vietnamese Easter Offensive.

Initial air strikes in support of ground troops were followed by a new, more intensive series of air strikes against major targets in North Vietnam. On 8 May, the same VF-96 aircrew team of Cunningham and Driscoll scored against a MiG-17. Then on 10 May, Cunningham and Driscoll downed three MiG-17s, becoming the first aces of the Vietnam war. Three more MiG-17s were downed by two other VF-96 crews, two by Lieutenant Michael J. Connelly and Lieutenant Thomas J. Blonski and one by Lieutenant Steven C. Shoemaker and Lieutenant (junior grade) Keith V. Crenshaw. Adding to the score, VF-92 aircrew Lieutenant Curt Dose and Lieutenant Commander James McDevitt shot down a MiG-21. All told, &quot;Constellation&quot; fliers shot down seven MiGs on 10 May. The nine-month deployment ended on 1 July, the carrier having spent 154 days off Vietnam. Seven aircraft were lost, two aircrewmen were reported KIA and two became POWs. The &quot;Constellation&quot;/CVW-9 team received the Presidential Unit Citation for their outstanding efforts.

==== Focus of antiwar activity ====

In 1971 &quot;Constellation&quot; became the target of significant antiwar activity in her homeport of San Diego. Two anti-Vietnam War groups, the Concerned Officers Movement and &quot;San Diego Nonviolent Action&quot; organized a &quot;Constellation Vote&quot; which became a major antiwar campaign over several months. It led to a citywide straw vote in late September 1971 with 54,721 votes counted. Over 82% of voters elected to keep the ship home, including 73% of the military personnel who voted. While not a &quot;real&quot; vote, the impact on public opinion was appreciable. The commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet was quoted as saying &quot;never was there such a concerted effort to entice American servicemen from their posts.&quot; This activity was the first of numerous anti-Vietnam War efforts directed against U.S. Navy ships that developed into the larger Stop Our Ship (SOS) movement.

A considerable amount of research was conducted into the role of aircraft carriers in modern warfare by Professor William Watson of MIT who was then a visiting Professor of History at UC San Diego. He argued in a widely distributed pamphlet that aircraft carriers had become weapons &quot;used to crush popular uprisings and to bully the weaker and poorer countries of the world.&quot; When &quot;Constellation&quot; set sail for Vietnam in late 1971, nine of her crew publicly refused to go and took sanctuary in a local Catholic church. The &quot;Connie 9&quot;, as they were quickly dubbed, were soon arrested in an early morning raid by US Marshals and flown back to the ship, but within weeks were honorably discharged from the Navy.

====Black sailor protests====
&quot;Constellation&quot; was the focus of media attention when black members of her crew protested what they saw as systemic racism in the Navy, leading to what some saw as an aborted mutiny in late 1972. &quot;Constellation&quot; returned to the United States on 1 July and prepared to return to the western Pacific in early 1973. Replacement personnel reported aboard while &quot;Constellation&quot; was in the United States until the ship had 250 more men than the ship&#x27;s berthing could accommodate. &quot;Constellation&quot;″s commanding officer ordered administrative (less than honorable) discharges for five black sailors he considered troublemakers. He planned to give early discharges to another 250 men whose enlistments would expire while &quot;Constellation&quot; was overseas. While &quot;Constellation&quot; was conducting exercises off the California coast, a rumor started that the captain was going to give 250 less than honorable discharges to black sailors. The captain scheduled an open meeting for 21:00 3 November to clarify the 250 planned discharges. At noon 3 November a group of 50 black sailors began a sit-in on a portion of the mess deck. On the night of 3–4 November 60 black sailors took control of the scheduled meeting, refused to leave the mess deck, and threatened to &quot;tear up the ship.&quot; &quot;Constellation&quot; returned to San Diego on 4 November to offload 130 men, including 12 white sailors, before returning to sea. &quot;Constellation&quot; returned to San Diego on 7 November and the offloaded sailors were transported back to the dock on 9 November, but only 8 boarded their ship. The remaining sailors sat down on the dock to be filmed by television crews and were ultimately transferred to shore stations for mast. Twelve received general discharges, 35 were honorably discharged but not recommended for re-enlistment, and 73 received punishments ranging from loss of pay and reduction in rate to warnings prior to being reassigned to sea duty.

====End of Vietnam War====
In January 1973, &quot;Constellation&quot; headed back to Southeast Asia. The Paris Peace Accords took effect on 28 January, but CVW-9 aircraft continued to strike targets in Laos until a cease-fire in that country was called on 21 February. Thus &quot;Connie&quot;, which had been on station at the beginning of combat operations in Vietnam in 1964, was on station at the end, nine years later. The remainder of the nine-month deployment consisted largely of flights in support of mine-clearing operations in North Vietnam.

Upon her return in October 1973, &quot;Constellation&quot; enjoyed a nine-month workup cycle, and departed in June 1974 for her first peacetime deployment in 10 years. On 23 November, she became the first carrier to enter the Persian Gulf since 1949. The six-month cruise ended on 24 December 1974.

A 14-month major overhaul and upgrade at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Washington, commenced in February 1975, during which &quot;Constellation&quot; was modified to reflect the Navy&#x27;s new multipurpose air, surface and antisubmarine warfare role for carriers. She was redesignated a CV on 30 June 1975. With the overhaul completed in April 1976, &quot;Connie&quot; could now operate both the new S-3A Viking and F-14A Tomcat. However, the workups uncovered problems, and a 26-day drydocking in late 1976 at Long Beach Naval Shipyard, California, was required. The highlight for the remaining workup cycle was participation in Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) multinational exercises held in and around the Hawaiian Islands. An uneventful April to November 1977 deployment, &quot;Connie&quot;″s tenth, to the Far East followed.

&quot;Constellation&quot;″s next deployment, from September 1978 to May 1979, was originally scheduled to end in March but was extended due to her sortie into the Indian Ocean in reaction to a political crisis in Yemen. Following a relatively short eight-month turnaround cycle, she was underway again in February 1980 under the command of Captain Leon Edney, USN. After participating in RIMPAC exercises, &quot;Constellation&quot; steamed westward to the Arabian Sea, where Gonzo Station had been established following the November 1979 takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran, Iran. &quot;Connie&quot; had reached the eastern Indian Ocean when the unsuccessful 24 April 1980 raid to free American hostages took place, and she relieved on Gonzo Station on 1 May. This at-sea period would last a record-setting 110 days. As a result, the crew of &quot;Constellation&quot; was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for their service. The deployment ended in mid-October.

=== 1980–1989 ===
During the 1981 workup cycle President Ronald Reagan visited &quot;Constellation&quot; on 20 August 1981 and proclaimed the carrier &quot;America&#x27;s Flagship&quot; while presenting the crew a presidential flag and announcing to the crew: &quot;Let friend and foe alike know that America has the muscle to back up its words, and ships like this and men like you are that muscle.&quot; Under the command of Captain Dennis M Brooks USN &quot;Constellation&quot; sailed to the western Pacific and Indian Ocean from October 1981 to May 1982.

In January 1983, &quot;Constellation&quot; entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for a 13-month complex overhaul, during which the ship&#x27;s Terrier missile system was replaced with NATO Sea Sparrow, the Phalanx Close-In Weapon System was added and modifications were made to allow the carrier to operate the new F/A-18A Hornet strike aircraft.
&quot;Connie&quot; deployed from February to August 1985 with CVW-14 embarked, marking the first deployment for the F/A-18. As part of this deployment, &quot;Constellation,&quot; and escorts including , , , and , made a port call at Mombasa in Kenya. It was during this deployment that &quot;Constellation&quot; gained her motto, &quot;Go Ahead Make My Day&quot;, which was painted on the ship&#x27;s island; a direct quote from President Ronald Reagan in response to terrorist threats made against &quot;Constellation&quot; when she responded to the American hostage crisis of 1985 TWA Flight 847. For their performance in 1985, &quot;Constellation&quot;″s crew earned the Meritorious Unit Citation, and the ship herself received the Secretary of the Navy&#x27;s Environmental Protection Award.

As preparations for a 1987 deployment proceeded, it was announced that &quot;Constellation&quot; had earned the coveted Pacific Fleet Battle Efficiency Award (Battle Efficiency E) for the 18-month period ending on 30 June 1986. During an April to October 1987 deployment, &quot;Connie&quot; conducted air operations in support of Operation Earnest Will, the escorting of re-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf as a result of Iranian attacks against international shipping. As a result, the crew of &quot;Constellation&quot; was awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for their service.

On the morning of 2 August 1988 &quot;Connie&quot; quietly slipped her moorings for a routine two-week carrier qualification off the coast of southern California. Things quickly turned out to be anything but routine. The ship had barely cleared the harbor when a JP-5 fuel leak in the uptakes rained down to number One main machinery room and erupted into a full blown conflagration that tore through the uptakes and spread throughout the ship. The Fuel Oil Supervisor and Oil Lab were blamed early on even though they were not transferring fuel at the time. One Main Top Watch (a Boiler Technician) triggered the halon fire suppression system as he exited the space. Unfortunately the standard procedure was to wait 30 minutes after Halon had been triggered to re-enter the space. When the crew re entered the space was still hot and reignited the fire. Three explosions rocked the ship and the crew went into General Quarters. Amid explosions and extreme heat, volunteers from the crew entered enclosed spaces to extinguish the fires and preserve the ship. Through the damage control efforts of her crew, &quot;Connie&quot;″s main fires were extinguished around 2100. To the crew&#x27;s horror, the fires reflashed and the crew went back into action.

Into the next day, the crew battled the blaze that had reflashed and continued to threaten the entire ship. During the conflagration, an over-temperature alarm sounded for the Mt. 23 CIWS 20 mm ammunition magazine. This necessitated the firecontrolmen offloading the magazine contents over the side because low firemain pressure precluded flooding the magazine to cool it. Mt. 23 was situated on the port side of the island just forward of the boiler uptakes. After the long battle fighting the main space and collateral fires, there were no fatalities. There were however some serious injuries ranging from broken bones to smoke inhalation. &quot;Connie&quot; pulled back into North Island on 3 August. The subsequent investigation showed that there was a problem with a JP-5 pipe leading to a fuel station that wasn&#x27;t adequately inspected after an in-port maintenance availability period. The problem was that a pipe that had long ago been removed that used to pass through the uptakes was hooked back up. The pipe in the uptakes just emptied into the uptakes where 1MMR&#x27;s 6 forced draft blowers sucked the fuel into the running boilers. The total amount of JP-5 pumped into the uptakes was approximately 20,000 gallons.

Round-the-clock repairs by the crew assisted by civilian contractors got the ship ready for deployment, on schedule. The &quot;Constellation&quot;/CVW-14 team deployed on 1 December 1988 for the Indian Ocean. She left port on three screws with the final repairs to the fourth screw being completed at Subic Bay, Philippines. Four days out to sea, a Prowler and its four crew members were lost at sea. On 13 December, a Harpoon anti-ship missile launched by an F/A-18 fighter from &quot;Constellation&quot; killed one sailor when it struck the merchant ship &quot;Jagvivek&quot;, a long Indian-owned ship, during an exercise at the Pacific Missile Range near Kauai, Hawaii. A Notice to Mariners had been issued warning of the danger, but &quot;Jagvivek&quot; left port before receiving the communication and subsequently strayed into the test range area, and the Harpoon missile, loaded just with an inert dummy warhead, locked onto it instead of its intended target. The West-Pac deployment ended six months later at San Diego on 1 June 1989.

=== 1990–1999 ===
With CVW-9 embarked, &quot;Connie&quot; departed San Diego on 12 February 1990 for the East Coast. Following exercises with the air forces of several South American countries, including Gringo-Gaucho with the Argentine Navy, while en route and preparations at Norfolk, Virginia, &quot;Constellation&quot; entered Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Pa., in July to begin an $800-million, three-year Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). Completed in March 1993, the SLEP was a cross between new construction and a comprehensive overhaul, designed to add 15 years to the carrier&#x27;s operational life. Among other things, her main, largest steam turbines were replaced, an operation that had never been designed into a ship of this size. &quot;Constellation&quot; conducted her post-SLEP shakedown with a number of CVW-17 squadrons, and then moored at Mayport, Florida, on 8 April.

With CVW-2 assigned, &quot;Connie&quot; departed Mayport on 29 May and conducted exercises with various South American air forces while en route to San Diego, where she arrived on 22 July 1993. This was one of the first opportunities that female enlisted personnel and officers were assigned temporary additional duty (TAD) to the squadrons to &quot;test&quot; shipboard life before women were officially eligible for assignment on combat ships or duty stations. With a total crew of about 3500 personnel, 80 women were assigned, of which 5 women worked daytime flight deck operations.

During May–June 1994 &quot;Connie&quot; and CVW-2 participated in RIMPAC exercises, and on 10 November departed San Diego for an extended deployment for the first time in six years. Exercises off Okinawa were followed by a series of exercises off Korea that year following a discovery by U.S intelligence: that North Korea was attempting to develop nuclear weapons. On 11 January 1995, the &quot;Constellation&quot; battle group entered the Persian Gulf to take up station in support of Operation Southern Watch (OSW), enforcing the no-fly zone over southern Iraq. The six-month deployment concluded with her return to San Diego on 10 May. Effective 1 October 1995, &quot;Constellation&quot; was assigned to Cruiser-Destroyer Group 1. &quot;Constellation&quot;″s next deployment, from 1 April to 1 October 1997, included a return to the Persian Gulf for Southern Watch, now under control of the United States Fifth Fleet. In over 10 weeks of operating in the Gulf, CVW-2 flew more than 4,400 sorties, with well over 1,000 Southern Watch sorties.

As &quot;Connie&quot; prepared for her 1999 deployment, tensions were once again rising on the Korean Peninsula following an exchange of gunfire between North and South Korean vessels. &quot;Constellation&quot; departed San Diego on 18 June 1999 for the Korean Peninsula to monitor the situation. On 28 August, she entered the Persian Gulf and in ten weeks conducted more than 5,000 sorties and 1,256 OSW sorties. This period was highlighted by air strikes against two Iraqi radar stations and an attempt by VF-2 to engage an Iraqi jet with the long-range Phoenix air-to-air missile on 14 September. CVW-2 aircraft engaged in nine specific ordnance-dropping air strikes while in the Persian Gulf. The battle group departed the Persian Gulf on 5 November, and she arrived home for the holidays on 17 December. At the year&#x27;s end, &quot;Constellation&quot; was awarded her second Battle Efficiency E as the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s best carrier for the 12-month reporting period.

=== 2000 onwards ===
&quot;Constellation&quot;″s 20th deployment began on 16 March 2001. She entered the Persian Gulf on 30 April and immediately commenced operations in support of OSW. On 13 May, Captain John W. Miller assumed command as &quot;Connie&quot;″s 30th skipper, and her last. She ceased OSW operations on 4 August, having conducted multiple air strikes in response to Iraqi violations of the no-fly zone. &quot;Connie&quot; departed Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on 9 September with dependents on board for the traditional Tiger Cruise on the final leg to San Diego. On 11 September &quot;Constellation&quot; was nearly halfway between Pearl Harbor and San Diego when word was received of the terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon. Despite discussions about turning the battle group around, the carrier was allowed to complete her regularly scheduled deployment. &quot;Connie&quot; arrived in San Diego on Friday 14 September and celebrated her 40th birthday the next month.

Following an abbreviated turnaround cycle, &quot;Constellation&quot; prepared for her final deployment and the opportunity to fight in the Global War on Terrorism. She departed on 2 November 2002, leading Cruiser-Destroyer Group 1 under the command of Rear Admiral Barry M. Costello. She was soon supporting Operation Enduring Freedom; on 17 December she entered the Persian Gulf to begin OSW missions. On 19 March 2003, with two carriers in the eastern Mediterranean and three in the gulf, Operation Iraqi Freedom commenced. &quot;Connie&quot; was designated a night carrier and remained on station throughout the major ground combat phase. She launched more than 1,500 sorties and CVW-2 aircraft delivered over 1.7 million pounds (770,000 kg) of ordnance. While one aircraft was lost in an operational mishap, there were no fatalities.

&quot;Connie&quot; departed the gulf on 17 April and steamed for San Diego for the last time. On 1 June a Sea Control Squadron 38 (VS-38) S-3B Viking crewed by Lieutenant Hartley Postlethwaite, Lieutenant (junior grade) Arthur Gutting and &quot;Constellation&quot; Commanding Officer, Captain John W. Miller, recorded &quot;Constellation&quot;″s 395,710th and final arrested landing. Her 21st and final deployment ended the next day.

&quot;Constellation&quot; was replaced by .

=== Decommissioning and scrapping ===
After 41 years of commissioned service, USS &quot;Constellation&quot; was decommissioned at the Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego on 7 August 2003. The ship was towed, beginning 12 September 2003, to the ghost fleet at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility, Bremerton, Washington. On 2 December 2003, the ship was stricken (formally removed from the Naval Vessel Register) when Admiral Vern Clark decided against expenditure of maintenance costs. &quot;Constellation&quot; was placed in Reserve Category X, meaning she received no maintenance or preservation, and only security against fire, flooding, and pilferage was provided. Reserve Category X applies to ships that have been stricken and are awaiting disposal by scrap, sale to foreign countries, as a designated target in a live fire exercise, memorial, or donation, as applicable.

According to news reports in February 2008, &quot;Constellation&quot; was scheduled to be disposed of by dismantling in the next five years, along with .

As of 26 January 2012, the Navy&#x27;s Naval Sea Systems Command posted a notice of solicitation for the towing and complete dismantlement of multiple CV-59/CV-63 Class Aircraft Carriers in the United States, to include ex-, ex-, and ex-&quot;Constellation&quot;.

Ex-&quot;Constellation&quot; was scrapped at Brownsville, Texas, starting in early 2015. She was towed around Cape Horn on her final voyage. NASA&#x27;s Operation IceBridge captured a photo south of Punta Arenas, Chile, of the ship being towed to the scrap yard. The carrier arrived at her final resting place in Brownsville on 16 January 2015. Scrapping was complete on 10 May 2017 when the last propeller shaft strut was pulled from the water.

== In popular culture ==
In 1996, &quot;Constellation&quot; and her crew were featured in an episode of Tim Allen&#x27;s 90&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. The episode, &quot;At Sea&quot; (Episode, Season 6) was partially filmed aboard &quot;Constellation&quot; while she was in San Diego, and originally aired on 17 September 1996.

The 2004 film &quot;Tiger Cruise&quot; is set aboard &quot;Constellation&quot; during the tiger cruise at the ending of her deployment in September 2001. The story tells of the events aboard the ship before, during, and after the September 11 attacks. &quot;Constellation&quot; actually was underway to Naval Air Station North Island with a number of &quot;tigers&quot; (family of crew members) on that day. The carrier had already been decommissioned when the movie was filmed; , and were used as stand-ins.

In 2012 film &quot;Avengers&quot;, the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier has the hull number &quot;64.&quot;

<text>Mira variables (named for the prototype star Mira) are a class of pulsating stars characterized by very red colours, pulsation periods longer than 100 days, and amplitudes greater than one magnitude in infrared and 2.5 magnitude at visual wavelengths. They are red giants in the very late stages of stellar evolution, on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), that will expel their outer envelopes as planetary nebulae and become white dwarfs within a few million years.

Mira variables are stars massive enough that they have undergone helium fusion in their cores but are less than two solar masses, stars that have already lost about half their initial mass. However, they can be thousands of times more luminous than the Sun due to their very large distended envelopes. They are pulsating due to the entire star expanding and contracting. This produces a change in temperature along with radius, both of which factors cause the variation in luminosity. The pulsation depends on the mass and radius of the star and there is a well-defined relationship between period and luminosity (and colour). The very large visual amplitudes are not due to large luminosity changes, but due to a shifting of energy output between infra-red and visual wavelengths as the stars change temperature during their pulsations.
Early models of Mira stars assumed that the star remained spherically symmetric during this process (largely to keep the computer modelling simple, rather than for physical reasons). A recent survey of Mira variable stars found that 75% of the Mira stars which could be resolved using the IOTA telescope are not spherically symmetric, a result which is consistent with previous images of individual Mira stars, so there is now pressure to do realistic three-dimensional modelling of Mira stars on supercomputers.

Mira variables may be oxygen-rich or carbon-rich. Carbon-rich stars such as R Leporis arise from a narrow set of conditions that override the normal tendency for AGB stars to maintain a surplus of oxygen over carbon at their surfaces due to dredge-ups. Pulsating AGB stars such as Mira variables undergo fusion in alternating hydrogen and helium shells, which produces periodic deep convection known as dredge-ups. These dredge-ups bring carbon from the helium burning shell to the surface and would result in a carbon star. However, in stars above about , hot bottom burning occurs. This is when the lower regions of the convective region are hot enough for significant CNO cycle fusion to take place which destroys much of the carbon before it can be transported to the surface. Thus more massive AGB stars do not become carbon-rich.

Mira variables are rapidly losing mass and this material often forms dust shrouds around the star. In some cases conditions are suitable for the formation of natural masers.

A small subset of Mira variables appear to change their period over time: the period increases or decreases by a substantial amount (up to a factor of three) over the course of several decades to a few centuries. This is believed to be caused by thermal pulses, where the helium shell reignites the outer hydrogen shell. This changes the structure of the star, which manifests itself as a change in period. This process is predicted to happen to all Mira variables, but the relatively short duration of thermal pulses (a few thousand years at most) over the asymptotic giant branch lifetime of the star (less than a million years), means we only see it in a few of the several thousand Mira stars known, possibly in R Hydrae. Most Mira variables do exhibit slight cycle-to-cycle changes in period, probably caused by nonlinear behaviour in the stellar envelope including deviations from spherical symmetry.

Mira variables are popular targets for amateur astronomers interested in variable star observations, because of their dramatic changes in brightness. Some Mira variables (including Mira itself) have reliable observations stretching back well over a century.

<text>Sexi (, ), also known as Ex, was a Phoenician colony at the present-day site of Almuñécar on southeastern Spain&#x27;s Mediterranean coast.

The Roman name for the place was . Alternative transcriptions of the Phoenician name of the city in Latin include and .

==History==

The ancient Phoenician settlement, whose earliest phases are unclear, was located southwest of the Solorius Mons (the modern Sierra Nevada mountain range). From the 3rd-2nd centuriesBC it issued a sizable corpus of coinage, with many coins depicting the Phoenico-Punic god Melqart on the obverse and one or two fish on the reverse, possibly alluding to the abundance of the sea and also a principal product of the area. The &quot;Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World&quot; equates ancient Sexi with modern Almuñécar.

<text>The English penny (plural &quot;pence&quot;), originally a coin of pure silver, was introduced by King Offa of Mercia. These coins were similar in size and weight to the continental &quot;deniers&quot; of the period and to the Anglo-Saxon sceats which had preceded it.

Throughout the period of the Kingdom of England, from its beginnings in the 9th century, the penny was produced in silver. Pennies of the same nominal value, of a pound sterling, were in circulation continuously until the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707.

The name &quot;penny&quot; comes from the Old English &quot;pennige&quot; (), sharing the same root as the German &quot;Pfennig&quot;. Its abbreviation d. comes from the Roman &quot;denarius&quot; and was used until decimalisation in 1971.

==Idioms==
Due to their ubiquity pennies have accumulated a great number of idioms to their name usually recognizing them for their commonality and minuscule value. 
These might include:
*cut (one) off without a penny
*mean enough to steal a penny off a dead man&#x27;s eyes
*not have two pennies to rub together
*penny-pincher
*penny-wise and pound-foolish
*spend a penny
*worth every penny

==History==

Anglo-Saxon silver pennies were the currency used to pay the Danegeld, essentially protection money paid to the Vikings so that they would go away and not ravage the land. As an illustration of how heavy a burden the Danegeld was, more Anglo-Saxon pennies from the decades around the first millennium have been found in Denmark than in England. In the reign of Ethelred the Unready (978–1016), some 40 million pennies were paid to the Danes, while King Canute (Knut) (1016–1035) paid off his invasion army with another 20 million pennies. This adds up to about of silver, equivalent to £250,000 at the time, and worth about £10 million in money (its purchasing power at that time may have exceeded £100 million and may have been as high as £1 billion in 2005).

The penny initially weighed 20 to 22.5 modern grains (1.3 to 1.5 g). It was standardized to 32 Tower grains, of a Tower pound (approx. 350 g). The alloy was set to sterling silver of .925 fineness in 1158 under King Henry II. The weight standard was changed to the Troy pound (373.242 g) in 1527 under Henry VIII, i.e. a pennyweight became about 1.555 grams. As the purity and weight of the coin was critical, the name of the moneyer who manufactured the coin, and at which mint, often appeared on the reverse side of the coin.

From the time of King Offa, the penny was the only denomination of coin minted in England for 500 years, until the attempted gold coinage issue of King Henry III in 1257 and a few halfpennies and farthings in 1222, the introduction of the groat by King Edward I in 1279, under whom the halfpenny and farthing were also reintroduced, and the later issues of King Edward III.

At the time of the 1702 London Mint Assay by Sir Isaac Newton, the silver content of British coinage was defined to be one troy ounce of sterling silver for 62 pence, or per penny. Therefore, the value of the monetary pound sterling was equivalent to only of sterling silver. This was the standard from 1601 to 1816.

<doc id="204542" wikidata="Q724629" url="?curid=204542" title="Frederick Muhlenberg">
<text>Frederick Augustus Conrad Muhlenberg (; January 1, 1750 – June 4, 1801) was an American minister and politician who was the first speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1789 to 1791 and again from 1793 to 1795. Muhlenberg served as the first dean of the United States House of Representatives as well. A member of the Federalist Party, he was delegate to the Pennsylvania state constitutional convention and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania and a Lutheran pastor by profession, Muhlenberg was born in Trappe, Pennsylvania. His home, known as the Speaker&#x27;s House, is now a museum and is currently undergoing restoration to restore its appearance during Muhlenberg&#x27;s occupancy.

==Early life and education==
Muhlenberg was born in Trappe, Pennsylvania, the son of Anna Maria (Weiser) and Heinrich Melchior Mühlenberg. His father, an immigrant from Germany, was considered the founder of the Lutheran Church in North America. His maternal grandfather was Pennsylvania German colonial leader Conrad Weiser. His brother, Peter, was a general in the Continental Army and his brother Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst was a botanist.

In 1763, together with his brothers John Peter Gabriel and Gotthilf Henry Ernst, he attended the Latina at the Franckesche Stiftungen in Halle, Germany. In 1769, he attended the University of Halle, where he studied theology.

==Career==
On October 25, 1770, Muhlenberg was ordained by the Pennsylvania Ministerium as a minister of the Lutheran Church. He preached in Stouchsburg, Pennsylvania, and Lebanon, Pennsylvania, from 1770 to 1774, and in New York City from 1774 to 1776. When the British Army entered New York at the onset of the American Revolutionary War, he felt obligated to leave, and returned to Pennsylvania. He moved to New Hanover Township, and was a pastor there and in Oley and New Goshenhoppen until August 1779.

=== Continental Congress ===
Muhlenberg was a member of the Continental Congress in 1779 and 1780, and served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1780 to 1783. He was elected its speaker on November 3, 1780. He was a delegate to and chairman of the Pennsylvania state constitutional convention in 1787 called to ratify the Federal Constitution. He was the first signer of the Bill of Rights.

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
He served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania in the first and the three succeeding United States Congresses (March 4, 1789 – March 4, 1797). Muhlenberg was also the first speaker of the United States House of Representatives. In August 1789, he cast the deciding vote for the location of the nation&#x27;s new capital. He did not seek renomination as speaker in 1796. On April 29, 1796, as chairman of the Committee of the Whole, he cast the deciding vote for the laws necessary to carry out the Jay Treaty.

In 1794, during Muhlenberg&#x27;s second tenure as Speaker, the House voted 42–41 against a proposal to translate some of the laws into German. Muhlenberg, who himself abstained from the vote, commented later that &quot;the faster the Germans become Americans, the better it will be.&quot; Despite not having voted against the bill, a legend, the Muhlenberg Legend, developed in which he was responsible for prohibiting German as an official language of the United States.

According to another legend, Muhlenberg also suggested that the title of the president of the United States should be &quot;Mr. President,&quot; instead of &quot;His High Mightiness&quot; or &quot;His Elected Majesty,&quot; as John Adams had suggested.

===Other offices===
Muhlenberg was the Federalist candidate in the 1793 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, losing to incumbent Thomas Mifflin.

Muhlenberg was president of the council of censors of Pennsylvania, and was appointed receiver general of the Pennsylvania Land Office on January 8, 1800, serving until his death in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on June 4, 1801.

==Personal life==
On October 15, 1771, Muhlenberg married Catherine Schaeffer, the daughter of wealthy Philadelphia sugar refiner David Schaeffer. They had seven children.

==Death==
On June 4, 1801, Muhlenberg died in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, at age 51. He was interred in Woodward Hill Cemetery in Lancaster.

==Legacy==
*On July 9, 1945, with World War II still ongoing, the S.S. &quot;Muhlenberg&quot;, named in Muhlenberg&#x27;s honor, was launched at the Bethlehem Fairfield Shipyard in Baltimore.

<doc id="204546" wikidata="Q653402" url="?curid=204546" title="Shimoda, Shizuoka">
<text>is a city and port located in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 19,670 in 10,436 households, and a population density of . The total area of the city is . In the 1850s, Japan was in political crisis over its increasing inability to maintain its national seclusion policy and the issue of what relations, if any, it should have with foreign powers. For a few years, Shimoda was central to this debate.

==Geography==
Shimoda is located at the southern tip of the Izu Peninsula about southwest of Tokyo. Shimoda&#x27;s location, with the Amagi Mountains to the north, and the warm Kuroshio Current to the south give the city a humid, sub-tropical climate.

===Surrounding municipalities===
*Shizuoka Prefecture
**Kawazu
**Matsuzaki
**Minamiizu

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Shimoda has been in slow decline since 1980.

===Climate===
The city has a climate characterized by hot and humid summers, and relatively mild winters (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Shimoda is . The average annual rainfall is with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .

== History ==
Shimoda has been settled since prehistoric times, with numerous Jōmon period remains found within city limits. It is mentioned in Nara period documents as the location to which Prince Ōtsu was exiled in 686 after his failed rebellion, and in Heian period documents in reference to its iron ore deposits. During the Sengoku period it was controlled by the Odawara Hōjō clan, who built a castle (later destroyed by Toyotomi Hideyoshi). Under the Tokugawa shogunate, Shimoda was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory directly administered by the &quot;shōgun&quot;. During the Edo period, Shimoda prospered as a seaport, and was a major port of call for coastal vessels travelling between Osaka and Edo. Until 1721, as a security measure, all vessels were obligated to call at Shimoda before proceeding on to Edo.

===Treaty port===
During the Bakumatsu period, Shimoda port was opened to American trade under the conditions of the Convention of Kanagawa, negotiated by Commodore Matthew Perry and signed on March 31, 1854. Shimoda was also the site of Yoshida Shōin&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to board Perry&#x27;s Black Ships in 1854.

The first American Consulate in Japan was opened at the temple of Gyokusen-ji under Consul General Townsend Harris. Harris negotiated the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the two countries, which was signed at nearby Ryōsen-ji in 1858. Gyokusen-ji is also the location of a small number of foreign graves dating from as early as 1854 marking the final resting place of US forces personnel that died while serving as a part of the Perry Expedition. Japan&#x27;s relations with Imperial Russia were also negotiated in Shimoda, and in 1855 the Treaty of Shimoda was signed at Chōraku-ji. In June 1859, with the opening of the port of Yokohama to foreign trade, the port of Shimoda was again closed and the American consulate was relocated to Zenpuku-ji in Edo.

After the Meiji Restoration, Shimoda came under the control of the short-lived Kikuma Domain in 1868, and the equally short-lived Ashigara Prefecture from 1871. The Mikomotoshima Lighthouse was completed in 1870 by British engineer Richard Henry Brunton. It is currently the oldest functioning lighthouse in Japan and is now a National Historic Monument. Ashigara Prefecture was divided between Kanagawa and Shizuoka prefectures in 1876. With the establishment of the modern municipalities system in 1889, Shimoda Town was formally established within Kamo District. The town was repeatedly bombed in 1945 in the final stages of World War II.

Shimoda expanded in March 1955 through the merger of six neighboring towns and villages. In 1958, an All Nippon Airways DC-3 en route from Haneda to Nagoya crashed in the sea off Shimoda, killing three passengers. Shimoda suffered damage from sizeable earthquakes in 1974 and in 1978.
==Government==
Shimoda has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 13 members. The current mayor is , who was elected in 2020.

==Economy==
The economy of Shimoda is based on tourism (primarily centered on the hot spring resorts and marine sports) and commercial fishing.

==Education==
Shimoda has seven public elementary schools and four public middle schools operated by the city government and one public high school operated by the Shizuoka Prefectural Board of Education. The prefecture also operates one special education school. Tsukuba University and Nihon University both have marine biology research centers in Shimoda.

== Local attractions==
Apart from its role in the opening of Japan, Shimoda is famous for its hot spring resorts and beaches. Tatadohama, Ohama and Iritahama beaches attract many tourists in summer and are popular surfing spots year round, and Iritahama has been voted most beautiful Japanese beach a number of years.

Shimoda is also a setting for much of Yasunari Kawabata&#x27;s famous short story &quot;The Dancing Girl of Izu&quot;.
Shimoda is the real-world inspiration for Pallet Town in the Pokémon video game and anime series.
