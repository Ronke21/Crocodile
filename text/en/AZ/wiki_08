<text>Rodgers and Hammerstein was a theater-writing team of composer Richard Rodgers (1902–1979) and lyricist-dramatist Oscar Hammerstein II (1895–1960), who together created a series of innovative and influential American musicals. Their musical theater writing partnership has been called the greatest of the 20th century.

Their popular Broadway productions in the 1940s and 1950s initiated what is considered the &quot;golden age&quot; of musical theater. Five of their Broadway shows, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;South Pacific&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, were outstanding successes, as was the television broadcast of &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1957). Of the other four shows the pair produced on Broadway during their lifetimes, &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; was well-received, and none was a critical or commercial flop. Most of their shows have received frequent revivals around the world, both professional and amateur. Among the many accolades their shows (and film versions of them) garnered were 34 Tony Awards, fifteen Academy Awards, two Pulitzer Prizes (for &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, 1944, and &quot;South Pacific&quot;, 1950) and two Grammy Awards.

==Previous work and partnerships==

At Columbia University, Rodgers and Hammerstein collaborated on the 1920 Varsity Show, &quot;Fly With Me&quot;. The songs for the show were originally written by Rodgers (a freshman) and Lorenz Hart. Hammerstein, who was on the judging committee, added two songs in the revising stage. The three men collaborated again on the 1921 Varsity Show, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot;, with Hammerstein as &quot;Director of Production&quot;. Although Rodgers did not work with Hammerstein again until &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, they achieved success independently from each other. Rodgers continued to collaborate for more than two decades with Hart. Among their many Broadway hits were the shows &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot; (1927), &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; (1937), &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot; (1938), &quot;Pal Joey&quot; (1940), and &quot;By Jupiter&quot; (1942), as well as many successful film projects.

Hammerstein, a co-writer of the popular Rudolf Friml 1924 operetta &quot;Rose-Marie&quot;, and Sigmund Romberg operettas &quot;The Desert Song&quot; (1926) and &quot;The New Moon&quot; (1928), began a successful collaboration with composer Jerome Kern on &quot;Sunny&quot; (1925), which was a hit. Their 1927 musical &quot;Show Boat&quot; is considered to be one of the masterpieces of the American musical theater. Other Hammerstein/Kern collaborations include &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot; (1929) and &quot;Very Warm for May&quot; (1939). Although the last of these was panned by critics, it contains one of Kern and Hammerstein&#x27;s best-loved songs, &quot;All the Things You Are&quot;.

By the early 1940s, Hart had sunk deeper into alcoholism and emotional turmoil, and he became unreliable, prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him.

==Early work==

===&quot;Oklahoma!&quot;===

Independently of each other, Rodgers and Hammerstein had been attracted to making a musical based on Lynn Riggs&#x27; stage play &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot;. When Jerome Kern declined Hammerstein&#x27;s offer to work on such a project and Hart refused Rodgers&#x27; offer to do the same, Rodgers and Hammerstein began their first collaboration. The result, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1943), marked a revolution in musical drama. Although not the first musical to tell a story of emotional depth and psychological complexity, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; introduced a number of new storytelling elements and techniques. These included its use of song and dance to convey and advance both plot and character, rather than act as a diversion from the story, and the firm integration of every song into the plot-line.

&quot;Oklahoma!&quot; was originally called &quot;Away We Go!&quot; and opened at the Shubert Theatre in New Haven in March 1943. Only a few changes were made before it opened on Broadway, but three would prove significant: the addition of a , &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;; the deletion of the musical number &quot;Boys and Girls Like You and Me&quot;, which would soon after be replaced with a reprise of &quot;People Will Say We&#x27;re in Love&quot;; and the decision to re-title the musical after the song.

The original Broadway production opened on March 31, 1943, at the St. James Theatre. Although the typical musical of the time was usually written around the talents of a specific performer, such as Ethel Merman or Fred Astaire, no stars were used in the production. Ultimately the original cast included Alfred Drake (Curly), Joan Roberts (Laurey), Celeste Holm (Ado Annie), Howard Da Silva (Jud Fry), Betty Garde (Aunt Eller), Lee Dixon (Will Parker) and Joseph Bulloff (Ali Hakim). Marc Platt danced the role of &quot;Dream Curly&quot;, and Katharine Sergava danced the part of &quot;Dream Laurey&quot;. In &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, the story and the songs were considered more important than sheer star power. Nevertheless, the production ran for a then-unprecedented 2,212 performances, finally closing on May 29, 1948. Many enduring musical standards come from this show, among them &quot;Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;The Surrey with the Fringe on Top&quot;, &quot;I Cain&#x27;t Say No&quot;, the aforementioned &quot;People Will Say We&#x27;re in Love&quot;, and &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;. The popularity of these songs prompted Decca Records to have the original cast record the music from the show with the original orchestrations. This became the first musical to have an original cast recording, which is now a standard practice.

In 1955 it was made into an Academy Award-winning musical film, the first feature shot with the Todd-AO 70 mm widescreen process. The film starred Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones, and its soundtrack was No. 1 on the 1956 album charts.

After their initial success with &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, the pair took a break from working together and Hammerstein concentrated on the musical &quot;Carmen Jones&quot;, a stage version of Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; with the characters changed to African Americans in the contemporary South, for which he wrote the book and lyrics. The musical was adapted to the screen in 1954, and scored a Best Actress Oscar nomination for leading lady Dorothy Dandridge. Rodgers and Hammerstein also received a special Pulitzer Prize in 1944 for &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;.

===&quot;Carousel&quot;===

The original production of &quot;Carousel&quot; was directed by Rouben Mamoulian and opened at Broadway&#x27;s Majestic Theatre on April 19, 1945, running for 890 performances and closing on May 24, 1947. The cast included John Raitt, Jan Clayton, Jean Darling, Christine Johnson and Bambi Linn. From this show came the hit musical numbers &quot;The Carousel Waltz&quot; (an instrumental), &quot;If I Loved You&quot;, &quot;June Is Bustin&#x27; Out All Over&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;.

&quot;Carousel&quot; was also revolutionary for its time – adapted from Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s play &quot;Liliom&quot;, it was one of the first musicals to contain a tragic plot about an antihero; it also contained an extended ballet that was crucial to the plot, and several extended musical scenes containing both sung and spoken material, as well as dance. The 1956 film version of &quot;Carousel&quot;, made in CinemaScope 55, again starred Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones, the same leads as the film version of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;

&quot;Carousel&quot; is also unique among the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals for not having an overture; both the stage and film versions began with the familiar &quot;Carousel Waltz&quot;. This music was included in John Mauceri&#x27;s Philips Records CD of the complete overtures of Rodgers and Hammerstein with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. It was also included in Rodgers&#x27; rare 1954 album for Columbia Records with the composer conducting the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.

===&quot;State Fair&quot;===
In 1945, a Technicolor musical film version of Phil Stong&#x27;s novel &quot;State Fair&quot;, with songs and script by Rodgers and Hammerstein, was released. The film, a remake of a 1933 non-musical Will Rogers film of the same name, starred Jeanne Crain, Dana Andrews, Dick Haymes, and Vivian Blaine. This was the only time the pair ever wrote a score directly for film. It was a great success, winning Rodgers and Hammerstein their lone Oscar together, for the song &quot;It Might as Well Be Spring&quot;, but it was also unadventurous material for them, compared with several of their Broadway shows. In 1962, an unsuccessful remake of the musical film was released.

In 1969, the St. Louis Municipal Opera presented the world stage premiere of &quot;State Fair&quot; starring Ozzie and Harriet Nelson. The production was directed by James Hammerstein, supervised by Richard Rodgers and choreographed by Tommy Tune. &quot;State Fair&quot; finally arrived on Broadway on March 27, 1996, with Donna McKechnie and Andrea McArdle, produced by David Merrick, and received five Tony Award nominations.

==&quot;South Pacific&quot; and important subsequent works==

===&quot;South Pacific&quot;===

South Pacific opened on Broadway on April 7, 1949, and ran for over five years. Its songs &quot;Bali Ha&#x27;i&quot;, &quot;Younger Than Springtime&quot;, and &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; have become standards. The play is based upon two short stories by James A. Michener from his book &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot;, which itself was the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1948. For their adaptation, Rodgers and Hammerstein, along with co-writer Joshua Logan, won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1950. The song &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Carefully Taught&quot; was controversial due to its support of interracial marriage. Rodgers and Hammerstein refused to remove it from the show, even if it meant the show failing. When the show was touring in Atlanta, Georgia, it offended some Georgian lawmakers, who proposed a bill to outlaw any entertainment they deemed to be inspired by Moscow.

In the original production, Mary Martin starred as the heroine Nellie Forbush, and opera star Ezio Pinza starred as Emile de Becque, the French plantation owner. Also in the cast were Juanita Hall, Myron McCormick and Betta St. John. The 1958 film version, also directed by Logan, starred Mitzi Gaynor, Rossano Brazzi, John Kerr, Ray Walston, and Juanita Hall. Brazzi, Kerr, and Hall had their singing dubbed by others.

===&quot;The King and I&quot;===
Based on Margaret Landon&#x27;s &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot;—the story of Anna Leonowens, governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s—Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s musical &quot;The King and I&quot; opened at the St. James Theatre on Broadway on March 29, 1951, starring Gertrude Lawrence as Anna and the mostly unknown Yul Brynner as the king. This musical featured the hit songs &quot;I Whistle a Happy Tune&quot;, &quot;Hello, Young Lovers&quot;, &quot;Getting to Know You&quot;, &quot;We Kiss in a Shadow&quot;, &quot;Something Wonderful&quot;, &quot;I Have Dreamed&quot;, and &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot;

&quot;The King and I&quot; was followed by &quot;Me and Juliet&quot;, which opened at the Majestic Theatre on May 28, 1953. When &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; returned to Broadway on August 31, 1953, with &quot;The King and I&quot;, &quot;Me and Juliet&quot; and &quot;South Pacific&quot; all still playing, Rodgers and Hammerstein had four shows appearing on Broadway at once.

&quot;The King and I&quot; was adapted for film in 1956 with Brynner re-creating his role opposite Deborah Kerr (whose singing was largely dubbed by Marni Nixon). Brynner won an Oscar as Best Actor for his portrayal, and Kerr was nominated as Best Actress. Brynner reprised the role twice on Broadway in 1977 and 1985 and in a short-lived TV sitcom in 1972, &quot;Anna and the King&quot;.

===&quot;Cinderella&quot;===

Based on the fairytale character and story of Cinderella, Rodgers and Hammerstein created their only collaborative effort written for television. &quot;Cinderella&quot; aired on March 31, 1957, on CBS. More than 107 million viewers saw the broadcast, and Julie Andrews was nominated for an Emmy Award for her performance in the title role. Rodgers and Hammerstein originally signed to work with NBC, but CBS approached them, offering the chance to work with Julie Andrews, and the two quickly agreed. Rodgers stated, &quot;What won us over was the chance to work with Julie.&quot; Andrews played Cinderella, with Edith Adams as the Fairy Godmother, Kaye Ballard and Alice Ghostley as stepsisters Joy and Portia, and Jon Cypher as Prince Christopher. Though it was broadcast in color, and the major networks all had the new (B&amp;W) videotape recorders from Ampex, a black and white kinescope is all that remains. It featured songs still treasured today, &quot;In My Own Little Corner&quot;, &quot;Ten Minutes Ago&quot; and &quot;Impossible: It&#x27;s Possible.&quot; After the success of the 1957 production, another version was presented in 1965 and shown annually on CBS, starring Lesley Ann Warren, Stuart Damon, Celeste Holm and Walter Pidgeon. Yet another television version first aired in 1997 on ABC, produced by Walt Disney Television, starring Brandy, Whitney Houston, Bernadette Peters, and Whoopi Goldberg. Stage versions were also presented in London and elsewhere, and the musical finally was given a Broadway production, with a revised book by Douglas Carter Beane, and incorporating four songs from the Rodgers and Hammerstein catalog, in 2013.

===&quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;===
Based on a 1957 novel by C. Y. Lee, &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; takes place in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown in the late 1950s. The original 1958 production was directed by dancer/singer/actor Gene Kelly. The story deals with a young Chinese woman who illegally comes to America in hopes of marrying a wealthy young Chinese-American man, who is already in love with a Chinatown nightclub dancer. The young man&#x27;s parents are traditional Chinese and want him to marry the new Chinese immigrant, but he is hesitant until he falls in love with her. Though this musical did not achieve the popularity of the team&#x27;s five most famous musicals, it was nevertheless a success and broke new ground by using a mostly Asian cast. The 1961 film adaptation was a lavish, but much criticized, Ross Hunter production released by Universal Studios. A Broadway revival in 2002 starring Lea Salonga had a rewritten plot by playwright David Henry Hwang but retained the inter-generational and immigrant themes as well as most of the original songs.

===&quot;The Sound of Music&quot;===

&quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s last work together, is based on the story of the Austrian Von Trapp Family. Starring Mary Martin as Maria and Theodore Bikel as Captain von Trapp, it opened on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on November 16, 1959, garnering much praise and numerous awards. It has been frequently revived ever since. The show was made into a film in 1965 starring Julie Andrews as Maria and Christopher Plummer as the Captain. It won five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, Robert Wise. Hammerstein died in August 1960, before the film was made, so when Rodgers was asked to create two new songs for the film (&quot;I Have Confidence&quot; and &quot;Something Good&quot;), he wrote the lyrics as well as the music. &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; contains more hit songs than any other Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, and the film version was the most financially successful film adaptation of a Broadway musical ever made. The most enduring of these include the title song, &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, &quot;Climb Ev&#x27;ry Mountain&quot;, &quot;So Long, Farewell&quot; and &quot;Sixteen Going on Seventeen&quot;. &quot;Edelweiss&quot; was the last song that Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote together.

==Legacy==
Rodgers and Hammerstein re-worked the musical theater genre. Early 20th-century musicals, except for the Princess Theatre musicals and a few important examples like Hammerstein and Jerome Kern&#x27;s &quot;Show Boat&quot;, were usually whimsical or farcical, and typically built around a star. Because the efforts of Rodgers and Hammerstein were so successful, many musicals that followed contained thought-provoking plots with mature themes, and in which all the aspects of the play, dance, song, and drama, were combined in an integrated whole. Stephen Sondheim has cited Rodgers and Hammerstein as having had a crucial influence on his work.

Rodgers and Hammerstein also use the technique of what some call the &quot;formula musical&quot;. While some hail this approach, others criticize it for its predictability. The term &quot;formula musical&quot; may refer to a musical with a predictable plot, but it also refers to the casting requirements of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein characters. Typically, any musical from this team will have the casting of a strong baritone lead, a dainty and light soprano lead, a supporting lead tenor, and a supporting alto lead. Although there are exceptions to this generalization, it simplifies the audition process and gives audiences an idea of what to expect vocally from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. However, this formula had been used in Viennese operetta, such as &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;.

William A. Everett and Paul R. Laird wrote that &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;like &quot;Show Boat&quot;, became a milestone, so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;&quot; In &quot;The Complete Book of Light Opera&quot;, Mark Lubbock adds, &quot;After &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, Rodgers and Hammerstein were the most important contributors to the musical-play form – with such masterworks as &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot; and &quot;South Pacific&quot;. The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own.&quot;

In 1950, the team of Rodgers and Hammerstein received The Hundred Year Association of New York&#x27;s Gold Medal Award &quot;in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.&quot; They were also honored in 1999 with a United States Postal Service stamp commemorating their partnership. The Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York City is named after Rodgers. &quot;Forbes&quot; named Rodgers and Hammerstein second on its list of top-earning dead celebrities in 2009 at $235 million. In 2010, the original film arrangements of the team&#x27;s music were restored and performed at the Proms concerts in London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall by the John Wilson Orchestra.

==On television and film==
Rodgers and Hammerstein appeared on live telecasts several times. They were guests on the very first broadcast of &quot;Toast of the Town&quot;, the original name of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, when it debuted on CBS in June 1948. In 1954, they appeared on a memorable TV musical special, &quot;General Foods 25th Anniversary Show: A Salute to Rodgers and Hammerstein&quot;. They were the mystery guests on episode number 298 of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;, which first aired on February 19, 1956; blindfolded panelist Arlene Francis was able to correctly identify them.

The pair made a rare feature film appearance in MGM&#x27;s 1953 production &quot;Main Street to Broadway&quot;, in which Rodgers played the piano and Hammerstein sang a song they had written. They also appeared in the trailer for the film version of &quot;South Pacific&quot; in 1958.

==Social issues==
While Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s work contains cheerful and often uplifting songs, they departed from the comic and sentimental tone of early 20th century musicals by seriously addressing issues such as racism, sexism and classism in many of their works. For example, &quot;Carousel&quot; concerns domestic violence, while &quot;South Pacific&quot; addresses racism. Based on the true story of the von Trapp family, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; explores the views of Austrians on the takeover of Austria by Nazi Germany.

<doc id="199829" wikidata="Q834020" url="?curid=199829" title="Angular frequency">
<text>In physics, angular frequency (symbol ω), also called angular speed and angular rate, is a scalar measure of the angle rate (the angle per unit time) or the temporal rate of change of the phase argument of a sinusoidal waveform or sine function (for example, in oscillations and waves).
Angular frequency (or angular speed) is the magnitude of the pseudovector quantity &quot;angular velocity&quot;.

Angular frequency can be obtained multiplying &quot;rotational frequency&quot;, &quot;ν&quot; (or ordinary &quot;frequency&quot;, &quot;f&quot;) by a full turn (2 radians): .
It can also be formulated as , the instantaneous rate of change of the angular displacement, &quot;θ&quot;, with respect to time, &quot;t&quot;.

== Unit ==
In SI units, angular frequency is normally presented in the unit radian per second. The unit hertz (Hz) is dimensionally equivalent, but by convention it is only used for frequency &quot;f&quot;, never for angular frequency &quot;ω&quot;. This convention is used to help avoid the confusion that arises when dealing with quantities such as frequency and angular quantities because the units of measure (such as cycle or radian) are considered to be one and hence may be omitted when expressing quantities in terms of SI units.

In digital signal processing, the frequency may be normalized by the sampling rate, yielding the normalized frequency.

== Examples ==

=== Circular motion ===

In a rotating or orbiting object, there is a relation between distance from the axis, formula_1, tangential speed, formula_2, and the angular frequency of the rotation. During one period, formula_3, a body in circular motion travels a distance formula_4. This distance is also equal to the circumference of the path traced out by the body, formula_5. Setting these two quantities equal, and recalling the link between period and angular frequency we obtain: formula_6 Circular motion on the unit circle is given by
formula_7
where:
* &quot;ω&quot; is the angular frequency (SI unit: radians per second),
* &quot;T&quot; is the period (SI unit: seconds),
* &quot;f&quot; is the ordinary frequency (SI unit: hertz).

=== Oscillations of a spring ===

An object attached to a spring can oscillate. If the spring is assumed to be ideal and massless with no damping, then the motion is simple and harmonic with an angular frequency given by
formula_8
where
* &quot;k&quot; is the spring constant,
* &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the object.

&quot;ω&quot; is referred to as the natural angular frequency (sometimes be denoted as &quot;ω&quot;0).

As the object oscillates, its acceleration can be calculated by
formula_9
where &quot;x&quot; is displacement from an equilibrium position.

Using standard frequency &quot;f&quot;, this equation would be
formula_10

=== LC circuits ===
The resonant angular frequency in a series LC circuit equals the square root of the reciprocal of the product of the capacitance (&quot;C&quot;, with SI unit farad) and the inductance of the circuit (&quot;L&quot;, with SI unit henry):
formula_11

Adding series resistance (for example, due to the resistance of the wire in a coil) does not change the resonant frequency of the series LC circuit. For a parallel tuned circuit, the above equation is often a useful approximation, but the resonant frequency does depend on the losses of parallel elements.

== Terminology ==
Although angular frequency is often loosely referred to as frequency, it differs from frequency by a factor of 2, which potentially leads confusion when the distinction is not made clear.

* Radian per second

<doc id="199830" wikidata="Q1468349" url="?curid=199830" title="Liberal Catholic Church">
<text>The names Liberal Catholic Church (LCC) and Liberal Catholic movement are used by a number of separate Independent Catholic denominations throughout the world descending from James I. Wedgwood, which combine Catholic sacramental practices with freedom of belief, and in particular openness to theosophical ideas.

==History==

=== Foundation of the Liberal Catholic Church ===
The Liberal Catholic Church was founded by J. I. Wedgwood and Charles Webster Leadbeater, two Theosophists. Wedgwood had been consecrated as a bishop in 1916 in England by Frederick Samuel Willoughby; Willoughby had been consecrated as bishop by Arnold Harris Mathew of the Old Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain, but had later been disowned by Mathew. Wedgwood then travelled to Australia and ordained and consecrated Leadbeater.

Wedgwood established the Liberal Catholic Church in the USA in 1917. Wedgwood says that during the existence of the early unified Liberal Catholic Church, he created the Liberal Rite. Following accusations of sexual misconduct with juveniles, in 1919, Wedgwood resigned from the Theosophical Society and the Liberal Catholic Church.

=== Liberal Catholic Church International ===
In 1947, a part of the LCC split due to the controversy over the suspension of an LCC bishop. This independent split is named &quot;Liberal Catholic Church International&quot; (LCCI), and despite its name it is only present in the USA. The LCCI claims to adhere to Catholicism &quot;with the widest measure of intellectual liberty and respect for the individual conscience.&quot;

Both the LCC and the LCCI &quot;describe themselves as the Liberal Catholic Church or the Liberal Catholic Church in the Province of the United States and both claim &#x27;official&#x27; status as the true church. Both the LCCI and the LCC have similarities and differences, but the critical distinction lies in the succession of bishops.&quot;

===Young Rite===

In 2006, former LCC Presiding Bishop Johannes van Alphen consecrated Markus van Alphen. Alphen, in turn, established the Young Rite. Bishop Johannes himself eventually joined the Young Rite, serving there until his death. Among the tenets of the Young Rite was the belief that all possessed a path to the priesthood, and anyone requesting ordination should receive it. This practice was abandoned in the United States after Markus van Alphen&#x27;s retirement and with the establishment of the Community of Saint George, a Young Rite jurisdiction. Young Rite USA now requires a multi-year formation program for its clergy.

<doc id="199831" wikidata="Q17070077" url="?curid=199831" title="Theosophical Society Adyar">
<text>The Theosophy Society was founded by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and others in 1875. The designation &#x27;Adyar&#x27; is sometimes added to the name to make it clear that this is the Theosophical Society headquartered there, after the American section and some other lodges separated from it in 1895, under William Quan Judge. In 1882, its headquarters moved with Blavatsky and president Henry Steel Olcott from New York to Adyar, an area of Chennai, India.

The US National Section of this organization is called the Theosophical Society in America located in Wheaton, Illinois.

== Founders ==

H. P. Blavatsky(Helena Petrovna Blavatsky), Henry Steel Olcott, William Quan Judge and others founded the Theosophical Society on 17 November 1875 in New York City. The American section split off with William Quan Judge as its leader. Henry Steel Olcott remained president until his death in 1907.

== Aims and ideals ==
# To form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color.
# To encourage the study of Comparative Religion, Philosophy and Science.
# To investigate unexplained laws of Nature and the powers latent in man.

=== Monastic/Non-monastic ===

The Theosophical Society is open to anybody who supports its three objects, regardless of belief, social custom or marriage status. Celibacy is neither encouraged nor discouraged, each member being free to decide his/her own way of life.

=== Spiritual discipline ===

The practice of brotherhood regardless of race, creed, sex, color, or any other difference is recommended. Nothing is mandatory. Members are free to have any or no spiritual practice at all.

=== Administration ===

The organization has a highly autonomous setup in that lodges and sections are fully autonomous. The President gets involved in National Section matters only when there is some dispute between them. Otherwise the President does not interfere in the matters of the sections or lodges. The President is nominated by the members of the General Council and then elected by members all over the world. The President holds office for seven-year period. The Vice-President acts on behalf of the President as necessary and assists him or her in various ways. The Secretary handles worldwide correspondence, maintains records including statistics of the worldwide membership of the Society, its Lodges and Sections, is responsible for producing an annual report, and is also the Secretary of the General Council and the Executive Committee of the Society. This Committee, which meets a number of times each year, implements the decisions of the General Council and makes financial and administrative decisions relating to the Society&#x27;s Headquarters. The Treasurer is responsible for the finances of the Society and prepares an annual financial report.

Locally, members are organised in lodges. When a country has at least seven lodges, these can be gathered in a national section. Lodges and sections have a democratic organisation in which chairperson, secretary, treasurer and optional other officers are elected. Similarly, officers of the national sections are directly elected by the members of that section in a business meeting.

== International Presidents ==
#Henry Steel Olcott (1875 to 1907).
#Annie Besant (1907 to 1933).
#George Arundale (1934 to 1945).
#Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa (1946 to 1953).
#Nilakanta Sri Ram (1953 to 1972).
#John Coats (1972 to 1980).
#Radha Burnier (1980 to 2013).
#Tim Boyd (2014 to ...)

== Activities ==
=== Religion &amp; spirituality ===
The Theosophical Society is organised in lodges and national sections. These organise meetings for religious study and lectures. Members individually practice any kind of meditation or other spiritual practice they choose.

=== Social field ===
* The Olcott Education Society
* The Olcott Memorial School
* The Olcott Memorial High School
* The Theosophical Order of Service

Olcott Memorial High School provides free education, uniforms, books, and two daily meals to impoverished rural children in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.

=== Cultural field ===
* Theosophical Publishing House

=== Besant Scout Camping Centre ===
Dr. Arundale, Provincial Scout Commissioner and President of Theosophical Society after Dr. Besant, set aside 10 acres of wooded area in the Olcott Gardens (part of TS) and named it Besant Scout Camping Centre (BSCC) in memory of the founder. Young Scouts and Guides frequent this on weekend for camping for various skill development and competitions amongst themselves.

=== Relief activities ===
When a Tsunami hit South India on 26 December 2004, it affected many of the people living near the Adyar-compound. The Theosophical Society, through the Theosophical Order of Service, helped the people survive both in the immediate aftermath and later. Similar activities were undertaken after the hurricane that destroyed much of New Orleans in 2005.

=== Province of its influence ===
The influence of the Theosophical Society has been major, especially considering its small size. The new age movement reflected many of its main characteristics, especially holism and eclecticism. In Modern Art, the artists Kandinsky and Mondriaan were both influenced by theosophy.

=== Theosophical Society and Jiddu Krishnamurti ===
The leadership of the Theosophical Society at Adyar was responsible for promoting young Jiddu Krishnamurti as the new &quot;World Teacher&quot; during the first few decades of the 20th century. Charles Webster Leadbeater, one of the Society&#x27;s leaders at the time, had &quot;discovered&quot; fourteen-year-old Krishnamurti in 1909, and considered him the likely &quot;vehicle&quot; for the expected reappearance of the Maitreya. However, as a young man in 1929, Krishnamurti disavowed his expected &quot;mission&quot; and disassociated himself from the Theosophical Society and its doctrines and practices. Over the next six decades he pursued an independent course, becoming widely known as an original, influential thinker and speaker on philosophical and religious subjects.

==The garden==

Known as the &quot;Huddleston Gardens&quot;, the Theosophical Society garden lies on the south bank of the Adyar River and covers 260 acres. The garden has migratory birds, fruit bats, snakes, jackals, wild cats, mongooses, hares, and a variety of spiders. Trees include the rare mahogany and other trees from across the globe. The garden also has a 450-year-old banyan tree, which is known locally as &quot;Adyar aala maram,&quot; whose aerial roots cover some 60,000 sq m. The main trunk fell under its own weight in 1996.

<text>Bernadette Peters (&quot;née&quot; Lazzara; born February 28, 1948) is an American actress and singer. Over a career spanning more than six decades, she has starred in musical theatre, television and film, performed in solo concerts and released recordings. She is a critically acclaimed Broadway performer, having received seven nominations for Tony Awards, winning two (plus an honorary award), and nine Drama Desk Award nominations, winning three. Four of the Broadway cast albums on which she has starred have won Grammy Awards.

Regarded by many as the foremost interpreter of the works of Stephen Sondheim, Peters is particularly noted for her roles on the Broadway stage, including in the musicals &quot;Mack and Mabel&quot; (1974), &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; (1984), &quot;Song and Dance&quot; (1985), &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (1987), &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; (1993), &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; (1999), &quot;Gypsy&quot; (2003), &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; (2010), &quot;Follies&quot; (2011), and &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (2018). She has recorded six solo albums as well as many cast albums, and performs regularly in her own solo concert act.

Peters first performed on the stage as a child actress and then a teenager in the 1960s, and in film and television from the 1970s. She was praised for this early work and for appearances on, among other programs, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, and for her roles in films including &quot;Silent Movie&quot; (1976), &quot;The Jerk&quot; (1979), &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; (1981, for which she won a Golden Globe Award), and &quot;Annie&quot; (1982). She has also acted in television shows such as &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;Smash&quot; (2012–2013), &quot;Mozart in the Jungle&quot; (2014–2018), &quot;The Good Fight&quot; (2017–2018), &quot;Zoey&#x27;s Extraordinary Playlist&quot; (2020–2021) and &quot;High Desert&quot; (2023).

== Early life and family ==
Peters was born into an Italian-American family in Ozone Park in the New York City borough of Queens, the youngest of three children. Her mother, Marguerite (née Maltese), started her in show business by putting her on the television show &quot;Juvenile Jury&quot; at the age of three and a half. Her father, Peter Lazzara, drove a bread delivery truck. Her siblings are casting director Donna DeSeta and Joseph Lazzara. She appeared on the television shows &quot;Name That Tune&quot; and several times on &quot;The Horn and Hardart Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; as a small child.

== Career ==
=== 1958–1974: Child actor ===
In January 1958, at age nine, she obtained her Actors Equity Card in the name Bernadette Peters to avoid ethnic typecasting, with the stage name taken from her father&#x27;s first name. She made her professional stage debut the same month in &quot;This Is Goggle&quot;, a comedy directed by Otto Preminger that closed during out-of-town tryouts before reaching New York. She then appeared on NBC television as Anna Stieman in &quot;A Boy Called Ciske&quot;, a Kraft Mystery Theatre production, in May 1958, and in a vignette entitled &quot;Miracle in the Orphanage&quot;, part of &quot;The Christmas Tree&quot;, a Hallmark Hall of Fame production, in December 1958, with fellow child actor Richard Thomas and veteran actors Jessica Tandy and Margaret Hamilton. She first appeared on the New York stage at age 10 as Tessie in the New York City Center revival of &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot; (1959). In her teen years, she attended Quintano&#x27;s School for Young Professionals, a now-defunct private school.

At age 13, Peters appeared as one of the &quot;Hollywood Blondes&quot; and was an understudy for &quot;Dainty June&quot; in the second national tour of &quot;&quot;. During this tour, Peters first met her long-time accompanist, conductor and arranger Marvin Laird, who was the assistant conductor for the tour. Laird recalled, &quot;I heard her sing an odd phrase or two and thought, &#x27;God that&#x27;s a big voice out of that little girl&#x27;&quot;. The next summer, she played Dainty June in summer stock, and in 1962 she recorded her first single. In 1964, she played Liesl in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and Jenny in &quot;Riverwind&quot; in summer stock at the Mt. Gretna Playhouse (Pennsylvania), and &quot;Riverwind&quot; again at the Bucks County Playhouse in 1966. Upon graduation from high school, she started working steadily, appearing Off-Broadway in the musicals &quot;The Penny Friend&quot; (1966) and &quot;Curley McDimple&quot; (1967) and as a standby on Broadway in &quot;The Girl in the Freudian Slip&quot; (1967). She made her Broadway debut in &quot;Johnny No-Trump&quot; in 1967, and next appeared as George M. Cohan&#x27;s sister Josie opposite Joel Grey in &quot;George M!&quot; (1968), winning the Theatre World Award.

Peters&#x27;s performance as &quot;Ruby&quot; in the 1968 Off-Broadway production of &quot;Dames at Sea&quot;, a parody of 1930s musicals, brought her critical acclaim and her first Drama Desk Award. She had appeared in an earlier 1966 version of &quot;Dames at Sea&quot; at the Off-Off-Broadway performance club Caffe Cino. Peters had starring roles in her next Broadway vehicles—Gelsomina in the 1969 musical version of the Italian film of the same name, &quot;La Strada&quot; (for which she won good reviews but the show closed after one performance) and Hildy in a revival of &quot;On the Town&quot; (1971), for which she received her first Tony Award nomination. She played Mabel Normand in &quot;Mack and Mabel&quot; (1974), receiving another Tony nomination. Clive Barnes wrote: &quot;With the splashy &quot;Mack &amp; Mabel&quot; ... diminutive and contralto Bernadette Peters found herself as a major Broadway star.&quot; The &quot;Mack and Mabel&quot; cast album became popular among musical theatre fans. She moved to Los Angeles in the early 1970s to concentrate on television and film work.

=== 1975–1989: Rise to prominence ===

Peters has appeared in more than 40 feature films or television films beginning in 1973, including the 1976 Mel Brooks film &quot;Silent Movie&quot; for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture. She co-starred in her own television series, &quot;All&#x27;s Fair&quot;, with Richard Crenna in 1976–77. She played a young, liberal photographer, who becomes romantically involved with an older, conservative columnist. Although Peters was praised for her charismatic performance, the show ran for only one season. Peters was nominated for a Golden Globe award as Best TV Actress – Musical/Comedy. Peters starred opposite Steve Martin in &quot;The Jerk&quot; (1979) in a role that he wrote for her, and again in &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; (1981), for which she won the Golden Globe Award as Best Motion Picture Actress in a Comedy or Musical. In &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot;, she played Eileen Everson, a schoolteacher turned prostitute. Of her performance in &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot;, John DiLeo wrote that she &quot;is not only poignant as you&#x27;d expect but has a surprising inner strength.&quot; Pauline Kael wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;: &quot;Peters is mysteriously right in every nuance.&quot;

Peters was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (1977). On &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, Peters sang the song &quot;Just One Person&quot; to Robin the Frog. She was one of the Muppets&#x27; guests when they hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 1979, again singing &quot;Just One Person&quot; to Robin, and she appeared in other episodes with the Muppets. She performed and presented at the Academy Awards broadcasts in 1976, 1981, 1983, 1987 and 1994. Peters has been a presenter at the annual Tony Awards ceremony and also co-hosted the ceremony with Gregory Hines in 2002. She also hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in November 1981. Peters has appeared on many TV variety shows, with stars such as Sonny and Cher and George Burns. She made 11 guest appearances on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; as well as appearing with Burnett in the 1972 made-for-television version of &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot; and the 1982 film &quot;Annie&quot;.
In 1982, Peters returned to the New York stage after an eight-year absence, in one of her few non-musical stage appearances, the Off-Broadway Manhattan Theatre Club production of the comedy-drama &quot;Sally and Marsha&quot;, for which she was nominated for a Drama Desk Award. She then returned to Broadway as Dot/Marie in the Stephen Sondheim–James Lapine musical &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; in 1984, for which she received her third Tony Award nomination. &quot;The New York Times&quot; theatre critic Frank Rich called her performance &quot;radiant&quot;. She recorded the role for PBS in 1986, winning a 1987 ACE Award. Her next role was Emma in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Song and Dance&quot; on Broadway in 1985, winning her first Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. Frank Rich wrote in an otherwise negative review of the show that Peters &quot;has no peer in the musical theater right now.&quot;

She then created the role of the Witch in Sondheim-Lapine&#x27;s &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (1987). Peters is &quot;considered by many to be the premier interpreter of [Sondheim&#x27;s] work,&quot; according to writer Alex Witchel. Raymond Knapp wrote that Peters &quot;achieved her definitive stardom&quot; in &quot;Sunday in the Park With George&quot; and &quot;Into the Woods&quot;. Sondheim has said of Peters, &quot;&quot;Like very few others, she sings and acts at the same time,&quot; he says. &quot;Most performers act and then sing, act and then sing ... Bernadette is flawless as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I can&#x27;t think of anything negative.&quot;&quot; She won the 1987 &quot;CableACE Award&quot; for her role as Dot in the television version of &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;. In 1989 she starred in the James Ivory film &quot;Slaves of New York&quot; and in the Buddy Van Horn action comedy film &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot; (1989) alongside Clint Eastwood.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990 she appeared in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot; (1990). The following year she acted as Marie D&#x27;Agoult in the James Lapine directed period drama film &quot;Impromptu&quot; (1991). Peters starred alongside Hugh Grant, Judy Davis, Emma Thompson, Mandy Patinkin, and Julian Sands. In 1997 she voiced Sophie in the animated musical film &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1997). Peters has also appeared in such television films as &quot;The Last Best Year&quot; (1990), &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1997; receiving a nomination for the &quot;Golden Satellite Award&quot; for her role), and as Circe in the 1997 miniseries &quot;The Odyssey&quot; (2001). Peters voiced Rita the stray cat in the &quot;Rita and Runt&quot; segments of the animated series &quot;Animaniacs&quot; in the 1990s. Peters, as Rita, sang both original songs written for the show and parodies of Broadway musical numbers.

Peters continued her association with Sondheim by appearing in a 1995 benefit concert of &quot;Anyone Can Whistle&quot;, playing the role of Fay Apple. Additionally, she appeared in several concerts featuring Sondheim&#x27;s work, and performed at his 1993 Kennedy Center Honors ceremony.

She next starred in the musical adaptation of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; with music by Marvin Hamlisch (1993). Peters won her second Tony for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her performance as Annie Oakley in the 1999 Broadway revival of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;. Among many glowing notices, critic Lloyd Rose of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; commented: &quot;[Peters] banishes all thoughts of Ethel Merman about two bars into her first number, &#x27;Doin&#x27; What Comes Natur&#x27;lly.&#x27; Partly this is because Merman&#x27;s Annie was a hearty, boisterous gal, while Peters&#x27; plays an adorable, slightly goofy gamine. ... For anyone who cares about the American musical theater, the chance to see Peters in this role is reason enough to see the show.&quot; &quot;Playbill&quot; went even further: &quot;Arguably the most talented comedienne in the musical theatre today, Peters manages to extract a laugh from most every line she delivers.&quot; Peters has been nominated for the Tony Award seven times, winning twice, and has also received an honorary Tony Award. She has also been nominated for the Drama Desk Award nine times, winning three times, for &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, &quot;Song and Dance&quot; and &quot;Dames at Sea&quot;.

=== 2000s ===

For her role in the Fox series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; (2001), Peters received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. Peters was also nominated for a 2003 Daytime Emmy Award, Outstanding Performer in a Children&#x27;s Special, for her work in the 2002 television film &quot;Bobbie&#x27;s Girl&quot;. She also performed at the Kennedy Center Honors ceremony for Burnett in 2003. Peters appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and on the day-time talk show &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, both as a co-host and a guest. She appeared on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; in November 2000, discussing her career and craft. Peters appeared with three generations of the Kirk Douglas family in the 2003 film &quot;It Runs in the Family&quot;, in which she played the wife of Michael Douglas&#x27;s character. That same year she acted in &quot;Prince Charming&quot; (2003). Also in 2003, Peters starred as Rose in the Broadway revival of &quot;&quot;, earning another Tony nomination. Ben Brantley in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Working against type and expectation under the direction of Sam Mendes, Ms. Peters has created the most complex and compelling portrait of her long career, and she has done this in ways that deviate radically from the Merman blueprint.&quot;

In March 2005, she made a pilot for an ABC situation comedy series titled &quot;Adopted&quot;, co-starring with Christine Baranski, but it was not picked up. In May 2006, she appeared in the film &quot;Come le formiche&quot; (&quot;Wine and Kisses&quot;) with F. Murray Abraham, filmed in Italy, playing a rich American who becomes involved with an Italian family that owns a vineyard. The DVD was released in 2007 in Italy. In 2006, she participated in a reading of the Sondheim-Weidman musical &quot;Bounce&quot;. In 2007, she participated in a charity reading of the play &quot;Love Letters&quot;, with actor John Dossett. Peters appeared in the Lifetime television film &quot;Living Proof&quot;, which was first broadcast on October 18, 2008. She played the role of Barbara, an art teacher with breast cancer, who is initially reluctant to participate in the study for the cancer drug Herceptin. Andrew Gans of &quot;Playbill&quot; wrote, &quot;Peters is able to choose from an expansive emotional palette to color the character, and her performance... is moving, humorous and ultimately spirit-raising&quot;.

Peters&#x27;s television work also includes guest appearances on several television series. She appeared as the sharp-tongued sister of Karen Walker (Megan Mullally) on the penultimate episode of the NBC series &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, &quot;Whatever Happened to Baby Gin?&quot; (May 2006); as a defense attorney on the NBC series, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (November 2006); as a judge on the ABC series &quot;Boston Legal&quot; (May 2007); and as an accident victim in &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (September 2008). Of her role in &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote: &quot;Peters is especially fine as she confronts a life spinning out of control. I&#x27;d make her an early contender for a guest-actor Emmy nomination.&quot; In January, February and May 2009, she appeared in the ABC series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; in five episodes as Jodie Papadakis, a magazine mogul running the YETI (Young Editors Training Initiative) program that Betty and Marc are in. Her appearance at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival in June 2009 was filmed and broadcast in Australia later that month.

=== 2010s ===
Peters starred in the Broadway revival of Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; (2010), succeeding Catherine Zeta-Jones in the role of Desirée Armfeldt. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer wrote of her performance,

Peters&#x27;s next stage appearance was in the role of Sally Durant Plummer in the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts production of the Sondheim–Goldman musical &quot;Follies&quot; in 2011. One critic wrote: &quot;Peters ... exquisitely captures the character&#x27;s unfathomable sadness and longing. It&#x27;s a star turn, for sure, but one that brings attention to itself because of its truthfulness. Not surprisingly, her rendition of &#x27;Losing My Mind&#x27; is simply shattering.&quot; She reprised the role in the Broadway revival at the Marquis Theatre, later in 2011, and received a nomination for the Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Actress in a Musical. At the 66th Tony Awards in 2012, Peters was presented with the honorary Isabelle Stevenson Award for &quot;making a substantial contribution of volunteered time and effort on behalf of one or more humanitarian, social service or charitable organizations, regardless of whether such organizations relate to the theatre&quot;, specifically for her work with Broadway Barks. In making the announcement for this award, the Tony official site noted &quot;With a rich generosity of spirit, Bernadette Peters&#x27; devotion to charitable causes is perhaps only outweighed by her much fêted dedication to performing. ... Peters&#x27; efforts are held in the highest regard on Broadway and beyond.&quot; BC/EFA&#x27;s Tom Viola said, &quot;Bernadette&#x27;s boundless compassion and generosity represent the best in all of us.&quot;

She starred in a 2012 film titled &quot;Coming Up Roses&quot;, playing a former musical comedy actress with two daughters. Peters first appeared in the NBC series &quot;Smash&quot; in the March 2012 episode &quot;The Workshop&quot;, as Leigh Conroy, Ivy&#x27;s mother, a retired Broadway star, who feels competitive because of her daughter&#x27;s blossoming career. She visits the workshop and sings &quot;Everything&#x27;s Coming Up Roses&quot; (from &quot;&quot;) at the urging of the workshop cast. She also appeared in the season 1 finale, &quot;Bombshell&quot; (May 2012), to celebrate Ivy&#x27;s presumed role as Marilyn, in &quot;The Parents&quot; episode (April 2013), where, as Leigh, she sings an original Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman song, &quot;Hang the Moon&quot;, and in the episodes &quot;Opening Night&quot; (April 2013) and &quot;The Phenomenon&quot; (May 2013). Peters starred in the Sondheim and Wynton Marsalis staged concert revue titled &quot;A Bed and a Chair: A New York Love Affair&quot; at New York City Center in 2013. This collaboration between Encores! and Jazz at Lincoln Center was directed by John Doyle, with jazzy arrangements of Sondheim&#x27;s songs. Peters sang &quot;Broadway Baby&quot;, &quot;The Ladies Who Lunch&quot;, &quot;Isn&#x27;t He Something?&quot;, &quot;I Remember&quot; and &quot;With So Little to Be Sure Of&quot;, among others. Jesse Green, in his review in &quot;New York Magazine&quot;″s &quot;Vulture&quot; site, commented: &quot;[W]hat a wrenching (and funny) actress Peters remains, not on top of her voice but through it.&quot; Brantley, in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;As a singer and actress, she just can&#x27;t help being ardent, full-throated and sincere. She also reminds us here of her considerable and original comic gifts.&quot;

From 2014 to 2018, Peters played Gloria Windsor, the chairwoman of the orchestra board in &quot;Mozart in the Jungle&quot;, a web video series by Amazon Studios based on Blair Tindall&#x27;s memoir of the same name. The show was picked up for a second and third season. She was a guest star in the 2014 Bravo television series &quot;Girlfriends&#x27; Guide to Divorce&quot; in the episode &quot;Rule #21: Leave Childishness to Children&quot;. Peters played the recurring role of Lenore Rindell, a financial scammer, in the CBS television series &quot;The Good Fight&quot;, in 2017 and 2018. In 2020, she played Ms. Freesia in the series &quot;Katy Keene&quot;. She returned to Broadway in the title role of the 2017 revival of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; at the Shubert Theatre. Succeeding Bette Midler, Peters began performances on January 20, 2018. Marilyn Stasio wrote in &quot;Variety&quot;: &quot;This Dolly&#x27;s personal style is to twinkle and charm people into getting her way. (Her &#x27;So Long, Dearie&#x27; is an irresistible gem.) She also has the acting chops to moisten eyeballs when she entreats her late husband to bless her renouncement of widowhood and rejoin the human race in &#x27;Before the Parade Passes By&#x27;.&quot; Peters played her final performance as Dolly on July 15, 2018.

=== 2020s ===
She next played Deb in &quot;Zoey&#x27;s Extraordinary Playlist&quot; (2020–2021) and the television film &quot;Zoey&#x27;s Extraordinary Christmas&quot; (2021) and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the role. Beginning in 2023, Peters plays the recurring role of Roslyn in the Apple TV+ comedy series &quot;High Desert&quot;.

Peters made her West End debut alongside Lea Salonga in the tribute revue &quot;Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s Old Friends&quot;, running at the Gielgud Theatre from September 2023 to January 2024. The revue is scheduled to transfer to Broadway&#x27;s Samuel J. Friedman Theatre in March 2025, again with Peters and Salonga, following a pre-Broadway run at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles.

==Recordings==

Peters has recorded six solo albums and several singles. Three of her albums have been nominated for the Grammy Award. Peters&#x27;s 1980 single &quot;Gee Whiz&quot;, remaking Carla Thomas&#x27; 1960 Memphis soul hit, reached the top forty on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles charts. She has recorded most of the Broadway and off-Broadway musicals she has appeared in, and four of these cast albums have won Grammy Awards.

Peters&#x27;s debut album in 1980 (an LP), titled &quot;Bernadette Peters&quot; contained 10 songs, including &quot;If You Were the Only Boy&quot;, &quot;Gee Whiz&quot; (a Top 40 hit single), &quot;Heartquake&quot;, &quot;Should&#x27;ve Never Let Him Go&quot;, &quot;Chico&#x27;s Girl&quot;, &quot;Pearl&#x27;s a Singer&quot;, &quot;Other Lady&quot;, &quot;Only Wounded&quot;, &quot;I Never Thought I&#x27;d Break&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot;. The original cover painting by Alberto Vargas was one of his last works, created at the age of 84. According to &quot;The New York Daily News&quot;, Peters &quot;persuaded him to do one last &#x27;Vargas Girls&#x27; portrait... She just went to his California retreat, asked him to do one more, he looked at her and said, &#x27;You ARE a Vargas girl!&#x27;&quot; She kept the original painting. The original title planned for the album was &quot;Decades&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote of her debut album:
Her next solo album, &quot;Now Playing&quot; (1981), featured songs by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, Carole Bayer Sager and Marvin Hamlisch, and Stephen Sondheim (for example, &quot;Broadway Baby&quot;). &quot;Bernadette Peters&quot; was re-released on CD in 1992 as &quot;Bernadette&quot;, with the 1980 Vargas cover art, and included some of the songs from &quot;Now Playing&quot;. In 1996, she was nominated for a Grammy Award for her best-selling album, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Baby Tonight&quot;, which includes popular songs by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Lyle Lovett, Hank Williams, Sam Cooke and Billy Joel, as well as Broadway classics by Leonard Bernstein and Rodgers and Hammerstein. The live recording of her 1996 Carnegie Hall concert, &quot;Sondheim, Etc. – Bernadette Peters Live At Carnegie Hall&quot;, also was nominated for a Grammy Award.

Peters&#x27;s next studio album, in 2002, &quot;Bernadette Peters Loves Rodgers and Hammerstein&quot;, consisted entirely of Rodgers and Hammerstein songs, including two that she often sings in her concerts, &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; and &quot;There Is Nothin&#x27; Like a Dame&quot;. This album, which reached position 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; &quot;Top Internet Albums&quot; chart, was her third album in a row nominated for a Grammy Award. It formed the basis of her Radio City Music Hall solo concert debut in June 2002. Her last solo album, titled &quot;Sondheim Etc., Etc. Live At Carnegie Hall: The Rest of It&quot;, was released in 2005. It consists of all of the songs (and patter) from her 1996 Carnegie Hall concert that were not included in the earlier recording. Additionally, Peters has recorded songs on other albums, such as &quot;Dublin Lady&quot; on John Whelan&#x27;s &quot;Flirting with the Edge&quot; (Narada, 1998). On the Mandy Patinkin &quot;Dress Casual&quot; 1990 album, Patinkin and Peters recorded the songs from Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s 1966 television play, &quot;Evening Primrose&quot;. On the tribute album &quot;Born to the Breed: A Tribute to Judy Collins&quot; Peters sings &quot;Trust Your Heart&quot;.

In &quot;The New York Times&quot; review of the 1986 Broadway cast recording of &quot;Song and Dance&quot; (titled &quot;Bernadette Peters in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &#x27;Song &amp; Dance&quot;&#x27;), Stephen Holden opined the recording was:

In 2003, Andrew Gans wrote in &quot;Playbill.com&quot; of Peters&#x27;s recording sessions for &quot;Gypsy&quot;: &quot;What is it about her voice that is so moving? Part womanly and part girlish, it is a powerful instrument, not only in volume (though that is impressive) but in the wealth of emotion it is able to convey. ... her voice – that mix of husky, sweet, rounded, vibrato-filled tones – induces a response that spans the emotional scale.&quot; Of her &quot;Rose&#x27;s Turn&quot;, Gans wrote: &quot;...her rendition of this song may be the highlight of a career already filled with many highlights: She has taken a song that has been delivered incredibly by others and brought it to a new level.&quot; Of her performance on the recording of &quot;Follies&quot; (2011), Steven Suskin wrote in &quot;Playbill.com&quot;: &quot;This is a fine Sally, the sort of Sally you&#x27;d expect to get from an actress like – well, Bernadette Peters. The performance on the CD is compelling; either this is simply the magic of the recording studio or Peters has changed what she does and how she does it.&quot;

==Concert performances==

Peters has been performing her solo concert in the United States and Canada for many years. She made her solo concert debut at Carnegie Hall in New York City in 1996, devoting the second half to the work of Stephen Sondheim. She performed a similar concert in London in 1999, which was recorded and released on VHS, and also aired on U.S. Public Television stations. She continues to perform her solo concert at venues around the U.S., such as the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, and with symphony orchestras such as the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Dallas Symphony, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic at Walt Disney Hall.

In a review of her 2002 Radio City Music Hall concert, Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Peters as &quot;the peaches-and-cream embodiment of an ageless storybook princess... inside a giant soap bubble floating toward heaven. A belief in the power of the dreams behind Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s songs, if not in their reality, was possible.&quot; Peters made her solo concert debut at Lincoln Center in New York City in 2006. Holden, reviewing this concert, noted, &quot;Even while swiveling across the stage of Avery Fisher Hall like a voluptuous Botticelli Venus in Bob Mackie spangles... she radiated a preternatural innocence... For the eternal child in all of us, she evokes a surrogate childhood playmate&quot;. Peters was the headliner at the 2009 Adelaide Cabaret Festival in Adelaide, Australia. The &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; wrote that Peters showed &quot;the verve, vigour and voice of someone half her age.&quot;

Peters&#x27;s concert performances often benefit arts organizations or help them to mark special occasions, such as her performance on an overnight cruise on the Seabourn Odyssey in a benefit for the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami in 2009. She was one of the performers to help celebrate the center&#x27;s grand opening in 2006. She headlined The Alliance of The Arts Black Tie Anniversary Gala at Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks, California, on November 21, 2009. She had helped to celebrate the opening of the Arts Plaza with concerts fifteen years earlier. In 2015, Peters performed in the concert &quot;Sinatra: Voice for a Century&quot; at Lincoln Center, a fundraiser for the new David Geffen Hall in celebration of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s 100th birthday. She sang &quot;It Never Entered My Mind&quot;. It was hosted by Seth MacFarlane and featured the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Sting, Billy Porter, Sutton Foster and Fantasia Barrino. PBS plans to broadcast it as part of its &quot;Live from Lincoln Center&quot; series in December 2015.

Since 2013, she has been touring intermittently with her cabaret act, &quot;An Evening with Bernadette Peters&quot;, and a concert series, &quot;Bernadette Peters in Concert&quot;. In April 2014, she gave concert performances in Australia. The reviewer for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; wrote: &quot;Perhaps it is a matter of personality as much as voice: a natural warmth and an instinct for never exaggerating the emotional content of a song. Whatever the case, it is easy to see and hear why, for 30 years, Bernadette Peters has probably been musical theatre&#x27;s finest performer. ... She even breathed new life into &#x27;Send In the Clowns&#x27;. ... Rather than make it emotionally swollen (as so many do), Peters contracted it, delicately squeezing out its essence like toothpaste from a near-empty tube.&quot; She gave concerts in June 2016 in the UK at the Royal Festival Hall, Manchester Opera House and Edinburgh Playhouse. In 2022, she participated in &quot;Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s Old Friends&quot;, a Cameron Mackintosh-produced tribute concert, May 3, 2022, at the Sondheim Theatre, London.

==Children&#x27;s books==

Peters sings four songs on the CD accompanying a 2005 children&#x27;s picture book &quot;Dewey Doo-it Helps Owlie Fly Again&quot;, the proceeds of which benefit the Christopher Reeve Foundation. Her co-star from &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;, Mandy Patinkin, also sings on the CD.

To support Broadway Barks, the animal adoption charity that she co-founded with Mary Tyler Moore, Peters has written three children&#x27;s books, illustrated by Liz Murphy. The first is about a scrappy dog, named after her dog Kramer, and the pleasure of adopting a pet. Titled &quot;Broadway Barks&quot;, the book is published by Blue Apple Books (2008). Peters wrote the words and music to a lullaby, titled &quot;Kramer&#x27;s Song&quot;, which is included on a CD in the book. The book reached #5 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Children&#x27;s Best Sellers: Picture Books list for the week of June 8, 2008.

Her second children&#x27;s book is the story of a pit bull, named after Peters&#x27;s dog Stella. The character would rather be a pig ballerina, but she learns to accept herself. Titled &quot;Stella is a Star&quot;, the book includes a CD with an original song written and performed by Peters and was released in April 2010 by Blue Apple Books. According to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;Turning the pages to Peters&#x27; spirited narration, which is provided in an accompanying CD, makes for a more rewarding reading experience. The story and disc end with a sneakily affecting self-esteem anthem, which, like the familiar tale itself, is buoyed by the author&#x27;s lovely vocals.&quot; Peters introduced the book at a reading and signing where she also sang part of the song, at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Festival of Books, Los Angeles, California, on April 24, 2010.

The third book, released in 2015, titled &quot;Stella and Charlie Friends Forever&quot;, is about her rescue dog Charlie joining her household, and how Charlie got along with her older dog, Stella.

== Activism and charity work ==
;Broadway Barks

In 1999, Peters and Mary Tyler Moore co-founded Broadway Barks, an annual animal adopt-a-thon. Each July, Peters hosts the Broadway Barks event in New York City. Peters held a concert, &quot;A Special Concert for Broadway Barks Because Broadway Cares&quot;, at the Minskoff Theatre, New York City, on November 9, 2009, as a benefit for both Broadway Barks and Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. The concert raised an estimated $615,000 for the two charities. Also in support of Broadway Barks, Peters has appeared on the daytime talk show &quot;Live With Regis and Kelly&quot;.

In 2018, Peters received the Brooke Astor Award from the Animal Medical Center for her lifelong commitment to animal welfare, including the &quot;over 2,000 adoptions&quot; to date at Broadway Barks events. In 2022, Broadway Barks held in its first in-person animal adoption event since the COVID-19 pandemic began, with many Broadway stars in attendance and many shelter organizations participating. Activists protesting against the Humane Society of New York, one of the shelter organizations represented at the event, briefly interrupted Peters&#x27;s speech there.

;Other
Peters serves on the board of trustees of Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS and participates in that organization&#x27;s events, such as the annual Broadway Flea Market and Grand Auction, and the &quot;Gypsy of the Year&quot; competition. She is also a member of the Board of Directors of Standing Tall, a non-profit educational program offering an innovative program for children with multiple disabilities, based in New York City. Her late husband was the Director and Treasurer of Standing Tall. The 1995 benefit concert &quot;Anyone Can Whistle&quot; and Peters&#x27;s &quot;Carnegie Hall&quot; 1996 concert were benefits for the Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis.

In 2007, Peters helped the Broadway community celebrate the end of the stagehand strike in a &quot;Broadway&#x27;s Back&quot; concert at the Marquis Theatre. In 2008, she was one of the participants in a fund-raiser for the Westport Country Playhouse, and in the opening ceremony and dedication of the renovated TKTS discount ticket booth in Times Square. That year, she also presented New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg with the Humanitarian Award at the Breast Cancer Research Foundation awards. On March 8, 2009, she helped celebrate the last birthday of Senator Ted Kennedy (singing &quot;There Is Nothin&#x27; Like a Dame&quot;) in a private concert and ceremony held at the Kennedy Center, hosted by Bill Cosby, with many senators, representatives, and President Barack and First Lady Michelle Obama in attendance. On November 19, 2009, she helped to celebrate the opening of The David Rubenstein Atrium at Lincoln Center.

On February 8, 2010, Peters was one of the many to honor Angela Lansbury at the annual Drama League of New York benefit, singing &quot;Not While I&#x27;m Around&quot;. In March 2010, Peters helped Stephen Sondheim celebrate his 80th birthday in the Roundabout Theatre Company &quot;Sondheim 80&quot; benefit. She was one of the Honorary Chairs. She had been part of the Roundabout Theatre&#x27;s Sondheim gala for his 75th birthday. In 2012, Peters became a Patron of The Stephen Sondheim Society. She performed at the Olivier Awards ceremony in 2014, singing the song &quot;Losing My Mind&quot;. A review in &quot;The Arts Desk&quot; read: &quot;The tradition of bringing over a Broadway baby or two ... presumably explained a late appearance by a still-luminous Bernadette Peters, who reached the very high note at the end of &#x27;Losing My Mind&#x27; often not attempted by interpreters of that particular Sondheim song.&quot;

==Personal life==
Peters and Steve Martin began a romantic relationship in 1977 that lasted approximately four years. By 1981, her popularity led to her appearing on the cover and in a non-nude spread in the December 1981 issue of &quot;Playboy Magazine&quot;, in which she posed in lingerie designed by Bob Mackie.

Peters married investment adviser Michael Wittenberg on July 20, 1996, at the Millbrook, New York home of long-time friend Mary Tyler Moore. Wittenberg died at age 43 on September 26, 2005, in a helicopter crash in Montenegro while on a business trip.
Peters has a mixed-breed dog named Charlie. She has adopted all of her dogs from shelters.

In 2012, New Dramatists, an organization that supports beginning playwrights, presented Peters with their Lifetime Achievement Award, stating: &quot;She has brought a new sound into the theatre and continues to do so, in surprising and miraculous ways. By some sleight of magic, her singularity always manages to bring out the best and richest in the work of her composers and writers.&quot; In 2013, the Drama League gave Peters its [[Drama League Award|Special Award of Distinguished Achievement in Musical Theatre Award]] for &quot;her contribution to the musical theatre.&quot; Peters was the Centennial Honoree at the Drama League Centennial Gala in 2015. A musical tribute was presented by many of Peters&#x27;s costars over the years, including the original and current casts of &quot;Dames at Sea&quot;. The League said that Peters &quot;exemplifies the absolute best of what American musical theater can be.&quot;

<doc id="199857" wikidata="Q547721" url="?curid=199857" title="Rhineland bastard">
<text>Rhineland bastard () was a derogatory term used in Nazi Germany to describe Afro-Germans, born of mixed-race relationships between German women and black African men of the French Army who were stationed in the Rhineland during its occupation by France after World War I.

After 1933, under Nazi racial theories, Afro-Germans deemed to be &quot;Rheinlandbastarde&quot; were persecuted. They were rounded up in a campaign of compulsory sterilization.

==History==
The term &quot;Rhineland bastard&quot; can be traced to 1919, just after World War I, when Entente troops, most of them French, occupied the Rhineland. The British historian Richard J. Evans suggests the number of mixed-race children among them was not more than five or six hundred. 

All World War I belligerents with colonial possessions went to great lengths to recruit soldiers from their colonies. Germany was the only one of the Central Powers with substantial overseas possessions; it used numerous non-white troops to defend its colonies. Regardless of German attitudes toward the indigenous inhabitants of German colonies, Germany&#x27;s lack of control of the sea lanes would have made it nearly impossible for the German Army to bring any substantial number of colonial troops to European battlefields. Notwithstanding the exact circumstances, most Germans quickly came to view non-white Allied troops with disdain and were contemptuous of the Allies&#x27; willingness to use these troops in Europe. 

Germans across the political spectrum regarded the occupation as a national disgrace. Many considered all forms of collaboration and fraternization with the occupiers as immoral (if not illegal) treason. From the spring of 1920 onward, German newspapers frequently ran hysterical stories about the alleged &quot;Black Horror on the Rhine&quot;, accusing Senegalese soldiers of routinely gang-raping thousands of German women and girls on a daily basis. In the popular 1921 novel &quot;Die Schwarze Schmach: Der Roman des geschändeten Deutschlands&quot; (&quot;The Black Shame A Novel of Disgraced Germany&quot;) by Guido Kreutzer, he wrote that all mixed race children born in the Rhineland are born &quot;physically and morally degenerate&quot; and are not German at all. Kreutzer also declared that the mothers of these children ceased to be German the moment they had sex with non-white men, and they could never join the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;. 

As Germans considered the occupation to be carried out by &quot;B-grade&quot; troops (a notion that was drawn from colonial and racial stereotypes), their humiliation was heightened, increasing hostility toward the women and children in these unions. In May 1920, the foreign minister of the new German government lodged a protest to his French counterpart stating that &quot;we will accept the inferior discipline amongst your white troops if you will only rid us as fast as possible of this black plague&quot;.

In the Rhineland itself, local opinion of the troops was very different. The soldiers were described as &quot;courteous and often popular&quot;, possibly because French colonial soldiers harbored less ill-will towards Germans than war-weary French occupiers.

In his book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, Adolf Hitler described children resulting from any kind of relationship to African occupation soldiers as a contamination of the white race &quot;by Negro blood on the Rhine in the heart of Europe.&quot; He thought that &quot;Jews were responsible for bringing Negroes into the Rhineland, with the ultimate idea of bastardizing the white race which they hate and thus lowering its cultural and political level so that the Jew might dominate.&quot; He also implied that this was a plot on the part of the French, since the population of France was being increasingly &quot;negrified&quot;.

==Colonial legacy==
Most of the tiny multiracial population in Germany at that time were children of German settlers and missionaries in the former German colonies in Africa and Melanesia, who had married local women or had children with them out of wedlock. With the loss of the German colonial empire after World War I, some of these colonists returned to Germany with their mixed-race families. While the black population of Nazi Germany was small20–25,000 in a population of over 65 millionthe Nazis decided to take action against those in the Rhineland. They despised black culture, which they considered inferior, and sought to prohibit &quot;traditionally black&quot; musical genres such as American jazz as being &quot;corrupt negro music&quot;. No official laws were enacted against the black population, or against the children of mixed parentage, as they were born from marriages and informal unions that preceded the Nuremberg laws of September 1935. The latter prohibited &quot;miscegenation&quot;. However, future sexual relations and &quot;mixed marriages&quot;, between so-called &quot;Aryans&quot; and &quot;non-Aryans&quot; were banned. In addition, persons of mixed parentage were deprived completely of the right to marry. 

The government established the &quot;Sonder Kommission Nr.3&quot; (&quot;Special Commission 3&quot;) and appointed Eugen Fischer, of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics, to head it. He was tasked with preventing procreation and reproduction by Rhineland bastards. It was decided that anyone so deemed would be sterilized under the 1933 Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring.

The program began in 1937, when local officials were asked to identify all Rhineland bastards under their jurisdiction. All together, some 800 children of mixed parentage were arrested and sterilized. According to Susan Samples, the Nazis went to great lengths to conceal their sterilization and abortion program.

<text>The National Action Party (, PAN) is a conservative political party in Mexico founded in 1939. It is one of the main political parties in the country, and, since the 1980s, has had success winning local, state, and national elections.

In the historic 2000 Mexican general election, PAN candidate Vicente Fox was elected president, the first time in 71 years that the Mexican presidency was not held by the traditional ruling party, the PRI. Six years later, PAN candidate Felipe Calderón succeeded Fox after winning the 2006 presidential election. From 2000 to 2012, the PAN was the strongest party in both houses of the Congress of the Union but lacked a majority in either house. In the 2006 legislative elections, the party won 207 out of 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 52 out of 128 senators. In the 2012 legislative elections, the PAN won 38 seats in the Senate and 114 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, but the party did not win the presidential election in 2012, 2018, or 2024. The members of this party are colloquially called &quot;panistas&quot;.

Notoriously, the two presidents elected as PAN candidates (Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón) have both left the party. Fox supported Institutional Revolutionary Party presidential candidates in 2012 and 2018, while Calderón founded his own party called México Libre.

==History==
===20th century===

====Founding====

The National Action Party was founded in 1939 by Manuel Gómez Morín, who had held a number of important government posts in the 1920s and 1930s. He saw the need for the creation of a permanent political party rather than an ephemeral organization to oppose the expansion of power by the post-revolutionary Mexican state. When Gómez Morín was rector of UNAM between 1933 and 1935, the government attempted to impose socialist education. In defending academic freedom, Gómez Morín forged connections with individuals and groups that later came together in the foundation of the PAN in September 1939. The Jesuit student organization, Unión Nacional de Estudiantes Católicos (UNEC), provided a well-organized network of adherents who successfully fought the imposition of a particular ideological view by the state. Gómez Morín was not himself a militant Catholic, but he was a devout believer who rejected liberalism and individualism. In 1939, Gómez Morín and a significant number of UNEC&#x27;s leadership came together to found the PAN. The PAN&#x27;s first executive committee and committees on political action and doctrine also had former Catholic student activists, including Luis Calderón Vega, the father of Felipe Calderón, who became President of Mexico in 2006. The PAN&#x27;s &quot;Doctrine of National Action&quot; was strongly influenced by Catholic social doctrine articulated in &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; (1891) and &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot; (1931) and rejected Marxist models of class warfare. The PAN&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;La Nación&quot; was founded by another former UNEC member, Carlos Séptien García.

The PAN originally brought together the Mexican socio-economic elite opposed to President Lázaro Cárdenas&#x27; reforms. In particular, it opposed his plan for free secular education, the nationalization of oil and land reform. The party, which at the time included personalities sympathetic to fascism, campaigned for Mexico&#x27;s neutrality during the Second World War.

Efraín González Luna, a former member of the Mexican Catholic Student Union (Unión Nacional de Estudiantes Católicos) (UNEC), a long-time militant Catholic and practicing lawyer from Guadalajara, helped broker the party&#x27;s informal alliance with the Catholic Church. However, the relationship between the PAN and the Catholic Church was not without tension. The party&#x27;s founder Gómez Morín was leery of clerical oversight of the party, although its members were mainly urban Catholic professionals and businessmen. For its part, the Church hierarchy did not want to identify itself with a particular political party, since the Constitution of 1917 forbade it. In the 1950s, the PAN, which had been seen to be Catholic in its makeup, became more ideologically secular.

====Electoral results====
The PAN initially was a party of &quot;civic example&quot;, an independent loyal opposition that generally did not win elections at any level. However, in the 1980s it began a transformation to a political power, beginning at the local and state levels in the North of Mexico. A split in the PAN occurred in 1977, with the pro-Catholic faction and the more secular wing splitting. The PAN had updated its positions following the Second Vatican Council, toward a greater affinity for the poor; however, more traditional Catholics were critical of that stance and nonreligious groups were also in opposition, since they wanted the party to be less explicitly Catholic and draw in more urban professionals and business groups, who would vote for a nonreligious opposition party. The conflict came to a head, and in 1977 the progressive Catholic wing left the party.

The PAN had strength in Northern Mexico and its candidates had won elections earlier on, but these victories were small in comparison to those of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. In 1946, PAN members Miguel Ramírez Munguía (Tacámbaro, Michoacán), Juan Gutiérrez Lascurain (Federal District), Antonio L. Rodríguez (Nuevo León) and Aquiles Elorduy García (Aguascalientes) became the first four federal deputies from the opposition in post-revolutionary Mexico. The following year, Manuel Torres Serranía from Quiroga, Michoacán became the party&#x27;s first municipal president and Alfonso Hernández Sánchez (from Zamora, Michoacán) its first state deputy. In 1962, Rosario Alcalá (Aguascalientes) became the first female candidate for state governor and two years later Florentina Villalobos Chaparro (Parral, Chihuahua) became the first female federal deputy. In 1967, Norma Villarreal de Zambrano (San Pedro Garza García, Nuevo León) became the first female municipal president.
Until the 1980s, the PAN was a weak opposition party that was considered pro-Catholic and pro-business, but never garnered many votes. Its strength, however, was that it was pro-democracy and pro-rule of law, so that its political profile was in contrast to the dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) that was widely and increasingly seen as corrupt. The PAN came to be viewed as viable opposition party for a wider range of voters as it became more secular and as Mexicans increasingly moved to cities. As the PAN increasingly called for end of fraud in Mexican elections, it appealed to a wider range of people.

In 1988, the newly created Assembly of Representatives of the Federal District had, for the first time, members of the PAN. In 1989, Ernesto Ruffo Appel (Baja California) became the first opposition governor. Two years later, his future successor in the Baja California government, Héctor Terán Terán, became the first federal senator from the PAN. From 1992 to 2000, PAN candidates won the elections for governorships in Guanajuato, Chihuahua, Jalisco, Querétaro, Nuevo León, Aguascalientes, Yucatán and Morelos.

===21st century===
====Electoral victory for the presidency, 2000====

In the 2000 presidential elections, the candidate of the &quot;Alianza por el Cambio&quot; (&quot;Alliance for Change&quot;), formed by the PAN and the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM), Vicente Fox Quesada won 42.5% of the popular vote and was elected president of Mexico. Fox was the first opposition candidate to defeat the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and its precursors after 71 years. It was a significant victory not only for the PAN, but Mexican democracy.

In the senate elections of the same date, the Alliance won 46 out of 128 seats in the Senate. The Alliance broke off the following year and the PVEM has since participated together with the PRI in most elections.

In the 2003 mid-term elections, the party won 30.74% of the popular vote and 153 out of 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. In 2003, the PAN lost the governorship of Nuevo León to the PRI and, the following year, failed to win back the state of Chihuahua from the PRI. Coupled with a bitterly fought election in Colima that was cancelled and later re-run, these developments were interpreted by some political analysts to be a significant rejection of the PAN in advance of the 2006 presidential election. In contrast, 2004 did see the PAN win for the first time in Tlaxcala, in a state that would not normally be considered PAN territory, although its candidate was a member of the PRI until a few months before the elections. It also managed to hold on to Querétaro (by a mere 3% margin against the PRI) and Aguascalientes (although in 2007, it lost most of the municipalities and the local Congress to the PRI). However, in 2005 the PAN lost the elections for the state government of Mexico State and Nayarit to the PRI. The former was considered one of the most important elections in the country because of the number of voters involved, which is higher than the elections for head of government of the Federal District. (See: 2003 Mexican elections, 2004 Mexican elections and 2005 Mexican elections for results.)

Significantly in the 2006 presidential election in 2006, the PAN candidate Felipe Calderón was elected to succeed Vicente Fox. Calderón was the son of one of the founders of the PAN, and was himself a former party president. He was selected as the PAN&#x27;s candidate, after beating his opponents Santiago Creel (Secretary of the Interior during Fox&#x27;s term) and Alberto Cárdenas (former governor of Jalisco) in every voting round in the party primaries. On 2 July 2006, Felipe Calderón secured a plurality of the votes cast. Finishing less than one percent behind was Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who challenged the results of the election on possible grounds of electoral fraud. In addition to the presidency, the PAN won 206 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 52 in the Senate, securing it the largest single party blocs in both houses.

In 2007, the PAN lost the governorship and the majority in the state congress of Yucatán to the PRI as well as the municipal presidency of Aguascalientes, but kept both the governorship and the majority in the state congress of Baja California. The PRI also obtained more municipal presidents and local congresspeople in Chihuahua, Durango, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes, Chiapas and Oaxaca. The PRD obtained more posts than the PAN in Zacatecas, Chiapas and Oaxaca.

In 2009, the PAN held 33 seats in the Senate and 142 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.

====Return of the PRI to presidency====
In 2012, the PAN lost the Presidential Election to Enrique Peña Nieto of the PRI. They also won 38 seats in the Senate (a gain of 3 seats), and 114 seats in the Chamber of Deputies (a loss of 28 seats). The government of president of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto (EPN) has faced multiple scandals, and allegations of corruption. Reforma who has run surveys of presidential approval since 1995, revealed EPN had received a mere 12% approval rating, the lowest since they started to survey for presidential approval.

==Ideology==

The PAN has been linked to a conservative stance in Mexican politics since its inception, but the party does not consider itself a fundamentally conservative party. The party ideology, at least in principle, is that of &quot;National Action&quot; which rejects a fundamental adherence to left- or right-wing politics or policies, instead requiring the adoption of such policies as correspond to the problems faced by the nation at any given moment. Thus both right- and left-wing policies may be considered equally carefully in formulation of national policy.

This theory of National Action politics, rejecting a fundamental adherence to right or left, is held within a strongly Christian context, and falls under the umbrella of Christian democracy.

The party theory was largely developed by early figures such as Gómez Morín and his associates. However, some observers consider the PAN claim to National Action politics to be weakened by the apparent persistent predominance of conservatism in PAN policy in practice. The PAN has similarities with Europe and Latin America&#x27;s Christian democratic parties.

===Economic policies===
The PAN currently occupies the right of Mexico&#x27;s political spectrum, advocating free enterprise, pragmatism, small government, privatization and libertarian reforms as well. The PAN is a member of the Christian Democrat Organization of America. In general, PAN claims to support free enterprise and thus free trade agreements.

===Social policies===
====Abortion====
Carlos Abascal, secretary of the interior in the latter part of the Fox administration, called emergency contraception a &quot;weapon of mass destruction&quot; in July 2005. It was during Fox&#x27;s term, however, that the &quot;morning-after&quot; pill was legalized, even though the Church had condemned the use of these kind of pills, calling them &quot;abortion pills&quot;.

The PAN produced a television spot against state-financed abortion, one that features popular comedian Chespirito (who was also featured on a TV spot promoting Vicente Fox in the 2000 presidential elections) and a second one that accuses the PRI and PRD of wanting to kill the unborn. After the abortion bill, which made abortion available, anonymous, and free or government-paid, was approved at the local legislature, the PAN requested the Human Rights Commission of the Federal District (CDHDF) to enact actions on the unconstitutionality of the measure, the CDHDF rejected the request as it found no basis of unconstitutionality. After unsuccessfully appealing to unconstitutionality, the PAN declared that it may request the remotion of Emilio Álvarez Icaza, the president of the Human Rights Commission of the Federal District, for his lack of moral quality. The PAN, with the members of the Association of Catholic Lawyers, gathered signatures and turned them in to the Federal District Electoral Institute (IEDF) to void the abortion bill and force a referendum, which was also rejected by the IEDF. In May 2007, the PAN started a campaign to encourage rejections to perform abortion among doctors in the Federal District based on conscience.

====Opposition to same-sex unions in Mexico====

The PAN has opposed measures to establish civil unions in Mexico City and Coahuila. On 9 November 2006, the government of the Federal District approved the first law establishing civil unions in Mexico. The members of the PAN, and a member of New Alliance were the only legislators that voted against it.

The same year, the local legislature of Coahuila approved the law of civil unions to which the PAN also opposed. The PAN also lodged an unconstitutionality plea before the Supreme Court of Justice of the State of Coahuila, alleging that the constitution has vowed to protect the institution of the family.

Guillermo Bustamente Manilla, a member of the PAN and the president of the National Parents Union (UNPF) is the father of Guillermo Bustamante Artasánchez, a law director of the Secretary of the Interior, Carlos Abascal, during Fox&#x27;s presidency and worked in the Calderón administration against abortion and same-sex civil unions. He called the latter as &quot;anti-natural.&quot; He has publicly asked voters not to cast votes for &quot;abortionist&quot; parties and those who are in favor of homosexual relationships.

<doc id="199865" wikidata="Q3469018" url="?curid=199865" title="Snipe">
<text>A snipe is any of about 26 wading bird species in three genera in the family Scolopacidae. They are characterized by a very long, slender bill, eyes placed high on the head, and cryptic/camouflaging plumage. The &quot;Gallinago&quot; snipes have a nearly worldwide distribution, the &quot;Lymnocryptes&quot; snipe is restricted to Asia and Europe and the &quot;Coenocorypha&quot; snipes are found only in the outlying islands of New Zealand. The four species of painted snipe are not closely related to the typical snipes, and are placed in their own family, the Rostratulidae.

==Behaviour==
Snipes search for invertebrates in the mud with a &quot;sewing-machine&quot; action of their long bills. The sensitivity of the bill is caused by filaments belonging to the fifth pair of nerves, which run almost to the tip and open immediately under the soft cuticle in a series of cells; a similar adaptation is found in sandpipers; this adaptation gives this portion of the surface of the premaxillaries a honeycomb-like appearance: with these filaments the bird can sense its food in the mud without seeing it.

==Diet==
Snipes feed mainly on insect larva. Other invertebrate prey include snails, crustaceans, and worms. The snipe&#x27;s bill allows the very tip to remain closed while the snipe slurps up invertebrates.

==Habitat==

Snipes can be found in various types of wet marshy settings including bogs, swamps, wet meadows, and along rivers, coast lines, and ponds. Snipes avoid settling in areas with dense vegetation, but rather seek marshy areas with patchy cover to hide from predators.

==Hunting==


Camouflage may enable snipes to remain undetected by hunters in marshland. The bird is also highly alert and startled easily, rarely staying long in the open. If the snipe flies, hunters have difficulty wing-shooting due to the bird&#x27;s erratic flight pattern.

The difficulties involved around hunting snipes gave rise to the military term &quot;sniper&quot;, which originally meant an expert hunter highly skilled in marksmanship and camouflaging, but later evolved to mean a sharpshooter or a shooter who makes distant shots from concealment.

<doc id="199866" wikidata="Q568914" url="?curid=199866" title="Ansar al-Islam in Kurdistan">
<text>Ansar al-Islam in Kurdistan (; &quot;the Supporters of Islam in Kurdistan&quot;), better known as Ansar al-Islam (; AAI), was a Kurdish Salafi jihadist and separatist militant group. It was established in the Islamic Emirate of Kurdistan in 2001 by Mullah Krekar. Its motive was to incorporate all of Kurdistan into an Islamic state, and the protection of Kurds. The group dissolved in 2003 after Operation Viking Hammer. The group was a designated terrorist organization in the United Nations, Australia, Canada, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and a known affiliate of al-Qaeda. The group had no connection to Jama&#x27;at Ansar al-Islam, another Salafi jihadist group that emerged in 2007, and was modeled after Ansar al-Islam.

== Name ==
Their official name was &quot;Ansar al-Islam in Kurdistan&quot;, meaning &quot;Supporters of Islam in Kurdistan&quot;, but they were called &quot;Ansar al-Islam&quot; for short.

The group received the nickname &quot;Kurdish Taliban&quot; because it was made up of Kurds who fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan, and for their similarity with the Taliban, including how both of them established Islamic Emirates under Sharia, both of their fighters were Islamist but had some nationalism (Taliban with Pashtun, Ansar with Kurdish), and both of them harshly persecuted non-Muslims.

==History==

===Formation===
Ansar al-Islam was formed in September 2001 in the Islamic Emirate of Kurdistan. It was a merger of Jund al-Islam, led by Abu Abdullah al-Shafi&#x27;i, and Islah, led by Mullah Krekar. Ansar al-Islam was led by Mullah Krekar, and seized the Islamic Emirate of Kurdistan from the Kurdistan Islamic Movement after it made an agreement with the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and joined Kurdistan Regional Government. The group later made allegiance to al-Qaeda, and allegedly received direct funds from al-Qaeda.

In 2002, Ansar al-Islam had over 700 fighters at its peak. Over 90% of its militants were Kurds.

Iran was accused of giving logistical support to the group in the Islamic Emirate of Kurdistan near the Iranian border. Upon its founding, Ansar al-Islam declared a war on all secular political parties in Iraqi Kurdistan. Throughout 2002, the group carried out attacks against the KRG and particularly assassinated high-level politicians, as well as engaging in battles and skirmishes. Ansar al-Islam mainly opposed the PUK. In the Islamic Emirate of Kurdistan, Ansar al-Islam implemented Sharia. They also restricted women&#x27;s rights, and targeted the Yarsani religious group as well as Sufis.

In late 2001 and early 2002, the group took advantage of some foreign jihadist volunteers fleeing Afghanistan following the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. One of the foreign jihadists was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who briefly stayed with them before leaving.

Prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, paramilitary teams from the Special Activities Division (SAD) and the Army&#x27;s 10th Special Forces Group entered Iraq and cooperated with the PUK to attack Ansar al-Islam. They launched Operation Viking Hammer in March 2003, and the PUK retook the lands of the Islamic Emirate of Kurdistan. Ansar al-Islam disbanded after the battle. Colin Powell claimed that there was a chemical weapons factory hidden in another location, and about fifteen reporters visited the location, but saw nothing except a studio which Ansar al-Islam planned to turn to a TV and radio station. They claimed that the studio was going to be used to make Ansar al-Islam propaganda.

===Reported re-emergence in Iraq===

After the defeat of ISIL and the recapture of Tuz Khurmatu by Turkmen and Shiite Popular Mobilization Forces during the 2017 Iraqi–Kurdish conflict, the town and its surroundings came under almost daily rocket attacks by a militant faction that used a white flag with the blackhead of a lion. These &quot;White Flags&quot;, led by Assi al-Qawali, reportedly consisted of Kurdish Islamist militants, ex-ISIL fighters, and Kurdistan Democratic Party supporters who claimed to be fighting to &quot;liberate the Kurdish lands occupied by the Iran-backed Shia militias&quot;. Iraqi security and intelligence officials said that intelligence reports made it likely that this new group was a front organization of Ansar al-Islam, which reportedly still had hundreds of fighters operating in the Hamrin Mountains. Kurds generally believed the Iraqi government had fabricated the group, or at least heavily exaggerated its significance.

==Alleged ties to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime==
In a &quot;Special Analysis&quot; report from 31 July 2002, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency accused Ansar al-Islam of being connected to Saddam Hussein, stating that &quot;the Iraqi regime seeks to influence and manipulate political events in the Kurdish-controlled north and probably has some type of assets in contact with Ansar al-Islam, either through liaison or through penetration by an intelligence asset.&quot; In January 2003, the U.S. claimed that Ansar al-Islam was a possible mediator between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, and claimed to have prepared evidence of it. Ansar al-Islam&#x27;s leader, Mullah Krekar, in January 2003, denied all allegations of links of Ansar al-Islam with Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government. Rohan Gunaratna, who specialized in global security, in January 2003, had agreed with Mullah Krekar, stating that there was no proof of links between Ansar al-Islam and Saddam Hussein. Mullah Krekar himself was a veteran of the 1991 Iraqi uprisings and claimed that if Iraq had done anything against the Islamic Emirate of Kurdistan, he would have personally killed Saddam Hussein. He refused to fight in the Iraqi insurgency, since many Iraqi jihadists were former Ba&#x27;athist officers.

In February 2003, Colin Powell, told the United Nations Security Council that &quot;Baghdad has an agent in the most senior levels of the radical organization, Ansar al-Islam, that controls this corner of Iraq. In 2000, this agent offered al-Qaeda a safe haven in the region. After we swept al-Qaeda from Afghanistan, some of its members accepted this safe haven.&quot; In January 2004, Colin Powell claimed that he had no proof of the alleged ties between Ansar al-Islam and Saddam Hussein. He stated that &quot;I have not seen smoking gun, concrete evidence about the connection, but I do believe the connections existed.&quot;

The Senate Report on Iraqi WMD Intelligence, issued in 2004, concluded that Saddam Hussein was aware of the presence of Ansar al-Islam in Iraqi Kurdistan, and that he considered the group a threat to his regime, and had attempted to gather intelligence against them. The Defense Intelligence Agency stated that senior Ansar al-Islam detainees denied any relationship with Saddam Hussein, claiming that he was an apostate. The U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence in September 2006 confirmed that &quot;Post-war information reveals that Iraq viewed Ansar al-Islam as a threat to the regime and attempted to collect intelligence on the group&quot;.

After Powell had left office, in an interview, he told Barbara Walters that his allegations of ties between Saddam Hussein and Ansar al-Islam were false and had tarnished his reputation. He stated that &quot;there were some people in the intelligence community who knew at that time that some of these sources were not good and shouldn&#x27;t be relied upon, and they didn&#x27;t speak up. That devastated me.&quot;

==Swedish fund-raising case==
Ali Berzengi and Ferman Abdullah, from Iraqi Kurdistan residing in Stockholm, raised money for what they claimed was poor children and Muslims. The money was then transferred through Abdullah&#x27;s food stand, using the hawala transfer system. The Swedish Security Service was informed in 2002 that people in Sweden had transferred money to Ansar al-Islam. On 19 April 2004, Berzengi and Abdullah were arrested along with Shaho Shahab, from Iraqi Kurdistan, and Bilal Ramadan, born in Lebanon. Ramadan was released in September after a court found that there was not enough incriminating evidence. Shahab was released in December after the government decided to deport him to Iraq. However, since Shahab risked the death penalty in Iraq, the deportation was not carried out. In Abdullah&#x27;s apartment, the police found a letter from a man who claimed to have contact with Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, as well as a detailed lesson on coded language.

On 12 May 2005, Abdullah and Berzengi were convicted of &quot;planning of terrorist offences&quot; () and &quot;planning of public devastation&quot; () by the Stockholm District Court. The Stockholm District Court said that Abdullah and Berzengi had transferred approximately one million SEK to Ansar al-Islam. According to the court there was strong evidence that the collected money had the specific purpose of financing terrorist attacks. Much of the evidence presented consisted of secret wire-tappings from U.S. and German intelligence sources. In the recordings, Abdullah and Berzengi used coded language to describe the attacks. Berzengi, who according to the court, was the mastermind, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, and Abdullah was sentenced to six years. The Svea Court of Appeal later reduced the sentences to five years for Berzengi, and four and a half years for Abdullah. The appeal to the Supreme Court was denied. They both are to be deported to Iraq after serving their sentences in Sweden. Abdullah is currently serving his sentence at the Norrköping Prison.

Berzengi and Abdullah&#x27;s conviction was the first conviction since the new Swedish terrorism legislation was taken into effect on 1 July 2003. It was also the first ever conviction in Western Europe of people financing terrorism.

==Links to al-Qaeda==
One of Ansar al-Islam&#x27;s leaders, Abu Abdullah al-Shafi&#x27;i, was trained by al-Qaeda during his stay in Afghanistan. Another early leading figure of Ansar al-Islam, Abu Abd al-Rahman, who was killed in October 2001, was convicted by the U.S. of ties to al-Qaeda. In a report dated 31 July 2002, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency concluded that &quot;Ansar al-Islam is an independent organization that receives assistance from al-Qaeda, but is not a branch of the group.&quot;

In early 2003, less than 10 percent of individuals in Ansar al-Islam were both Taliban and al-Qaeda members. This, and the information about Shafi&#x27;i and Abd al-Rahman, led Colin Powell in January 2003 to claim that ties between Ansar al-Islam and al-Qaeda exist, and that the U.S. was preparing to unveil new evidence of it.

Rohan Gunaratna stated that &quot;Ansar al-Islam has links with al-Qaeda. In fact, it is an associate group of al-Qaeda&quot;. Mullah Krekar in January 2003 denied having links with al-Qaeda. In March–April 2003, Mullah Krekar again protested against such links, and said to newspaper &quot;Al-Hayat&quot; that he had ties with the United States government prior to the September 11 attacks, and that he had &quot;irrefutable evidence against the Americans&quot;, which he was &quot;prepared to release it&quot; if the United States continued accusing him of being &quot;linked to terrorism&quot;.

==Designation as a terrorist organization==

==Leadership==
Ansar al-Islam&#x27;s first leader was Abu Abdullah al-Shafi&#x27;i, until shortly after 11 September 2001. Mullah Krekar in 2001 replaced Shafi&#x27;i as leader of Ansar al-Islam, and Shafi&#x27;i became his deputy.

==Claimed and alleged attacks==
On 18 February 2001, four Kurdish Ansar al-Islam members assassinated Franso Hariri while he was on his way to work. Two previous attempts had been made on his life in Erbil in 1994 and 1997 at the same place and the same street, but he escaped from both.

On 22 March 2003, Ansar al-Islam detonated a car bomb, killing Australian journalist Paul Moran and several others. The group was also accused of the attempted bombing of a United States Department of Defense office in Erbil, on 9 September 2003, which killed three people.

Another attack was the stabbing of a police officer in Berlin on 17 September 2015, by Ansar al-Islam veteran Rafik Yousef, who previously attempted to assassinate Ayad Allawi.

<doc id="199867" wikidata="Q1395992" url="?curid=199867" title="John Lambert (general)">
<text>Major-General John Lambert (7 September 1619 – 1 March 1684) was an English army officer and politician. Widely regarded as one of the most talented commanders of the era, he fought on the Parliamentarian side throughout the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, and was largely responsible for the English victory in the Anglo-Scottish war of 1650–1652.

Although Lambert was involved in the discussions between the New Model Army and Parliament during 1647, his first formal involvement in civilian politics was in 1653, when he became a member of the English Council of State. In December 1653, he helped prepare the &quot;Instrument of Government&quot;, which became the constitutional framework for the Protectorate. He later fell out with Oliver Cromwell, largely because he opposed converting Cromwell’s role as Lord Protector into a kingship.

Lambert lost his offices in 1657 after refusing to swear an oath of loyalty to Cromwell, but in early 1659, following Cromwell&#x27;s death in September 1658, he re-entered politics as Member of Parliament for Pontefract. When Richard Cromwell resigned in May, Lambert became a member of the Committee of Safety and successfully suppressed the Royalist Booth&#x27;s Uprising. He was then sent to deal with George Monck, but his army disintegrated and he was imprisoned in the Tower of London on 3 March 1660.

Lambert escaped a month later, on 9 April, and made one final attempt to resist the Restoration before being recaptured on 24 April. Despite his prominent role in the Protectorate, he had not participated in the Trial of Charles I and had many close connections with senior Royalists. Although he was sentenced to death, this was commuted to life imprisonment; he spent the remaining 24 years of his life under house arrest, first on Guernsey, then on Drake&#x27;s Island near Plymouth, where he died on 1 March 1684.

==Personal details==
John Lambert was born at Calton Hall, near Kirkby Malham in Yorkshire, son of Josias Lambert (1554-1632) and his third wife, Anne Pigott (ca 1605-1643). He had two half-sisters from his father&#x27;s previous marriages, Cassandra and Jane.

A well-established member of the minor Yorkshire gentry, by the late 1620s Josias was in serious financial difficulties and died almost bankrupt. As a minor, John Lambert became the ward of Sir William Lister, a long-standing family friend, who appears to have paid for his education at Trinity College, Cambridge.

In 1639 he married Frances Lister (1622–1676), Sir William&#x27;s younger daughter; they had three children who survived into adulthood, Thomas (1639-1694), John (1639-1701) and Mary (1642-1675).

==Career==

===First English Civil War===
Pre-Civil War Yorkshire was characterised by close links among the local gentry, which often overrode political or religious differences. Although Lambert and the Listers followed Lord Fairfax in supporting Parliament, they were related by marriage and blood to Royalists like Sir Henry Slingsby and John Belasyse. Even during the 1650s, Lambert remained on good terms with Belasyse, despite the latter being a Catholic and leader of the secret Royalist association known as the Sealed Knot.

When the First English Civil War began in August 1642, Lambert joined the Parliamentarian army of the Northern Association, commanded by the elder Fairfax. He fought at Tadcaster in December 1642, where his brother-in-law William Lister was killed and quickly established a reputation as a confident and aggressive soldier. He played a prominent role in the defence of Hull and participated in Parliamentarian victories at Nantwich and Selby in early 1644. At Marston Moor, fought just outside York on 2 July, he and Thomas Fairfax led the Parliamentarian right, which was routed by Lord Goring. Accompanied only by a few troops, the two men fought their way across the battlefield to join Oliver Cromwell on the left and help secure victory.

In January 1645, Thomas Fairfax was appointed commander of the New Model Army and Lambert promoted Commissary General of the Northern Association, effectively acting as his deputy. During the siege of Pontefract Castle, one of the few Royalist positions left in the north, he was wounded and defeated on 1 March by a relief force led by Marmaduke Langdale. Shortly after this, Fairfax was finally replaced as commander in the north by the Presbyterian mercenary Sydnam Poyntz. Lambert transferred to the New Model, although shortage of troops meant he remained in the north until just after Naseby in June 1645, when he served in Fairfax&#x27;s western campaign. He supervised the capture of Dartmouth in January 1646 and was present at the sieges of Truro in March, Exeter in April and finally Oxford in June, which ended the First Civil War. In a sign of his growing stature within the New Model, Lambert acted as a commissioner for each surrender, in conjunction with Henry Ireton.

===Second English Civil War===

Victory exposed long-standing divisions between mostly Presbyterian moderates led by Denzil Holles who dominated Parliament, and radicals within the New Model Army, focused around Cromwell. Originating in differences over the political settlement with Charles I, it was exacerbated by financial issues and by March 1647, the New Model Army was owed more than £3 million in unpaid wages. Parliament ordered it to Ireland, stating only those who agreed would be paid; when their representatives demanded full payment for all in advance, it was disbanded, but the army refused to comply.

Concerned by the influence of radicals such as the Levellers within the New Model Army, the Army Council was established to ensure a united front against Holles and his supporters. Working with Ireton, Lambert helped draw up the army&#x27;s terms for a peace settlement with the king, although the extent of his involvement has been challenged by some historians. After these were rejected by Charles, the Holles faction demanded he be invited to London for further talks. Fearing Charles was going to be restored without significant concessions, the Army Council took control of the city on 7 August and in October expelled their leading opponents from Parliament, the so-called Eleven Members.

When the Northern Association army mutinied in early July 1647, Lambert was reinstated as commander and quickly succeeded in restoring discipline. This was essential because a similar political struggle was taking place in Scotland between the Kirk Party and the Engagers, who gained control of government in April 1648. Backed by an alliance of English/Welsh Royalists and former Parliamentarian moderates, they agreed to restore Charles to the English throne and initiated the Second English Civil War in April 1648.

Most of the New Model Army was with Fairfax, who was suppressing revolts in Essex and Kent, and Cromwell in South Wales, leaving Lambert facing a precarious situation in the north. The garrisons of Pontefract and Scarborough changed sides, while Royalists led by Sir Marmaduke Langdale captured Berwick and Carlisle. Although he could not prevent the Engagers under Hamilton crossing the border in July, Lambert fought a series of skilful delaying actions until Cromwell was able to join him. The Royalist/Engager army was destroyed after three days of fighting at Preston in August, while Lambert captured Hamilton at Uttoxeter on 25 August.

Although the war was largely over, the Kirk Party asked for support and Lambert entered Edinburgh in September, before returning to Yorkshire. He supported the &#x27;Remonstrance of the Army&#x27; issued in November, listing their grievances against Charles and Parliament, and named as one of the judges for the trial of Charles I. However, until March 1649 he was absent at the siege of Pontefract and thus avoided involvement in his execution in January, although he did not oppose it.

===The Commonwealth===

When Cromwell was appointed to the command of the war in Scotland (July 1650), Lambert went with him as major-general and second in command. He was wounded at Musselburgh, but returned to the front in time to take a conspicuous share in the victory of Dunbar. He himself repulsed a surprise attack by the Covenanters at the Battle of Hamilton on 1 December 1650. In July 1651 he was sent into Fife to get in the rear and flank of the Scottish army near Falkirk, and force them to decisive action by cutting off their supplies. This mission, in the course of which Lambert won an important victory at Inverkeithing, was so successful that Charles II, as Lambert had foreseen, made for England. Lambert&#x27;s part in the general plan of the resulting Worcester campaign was carried out brilliantly (including his capture of Upton-Upon-Severn), and in the crowning victory of Worcester he commanded the right wing of the English army, and had his horse shot under him. Parliament granted him lands in Scotland worth £1000 per annum.

In October 1651 Lambert was made a commissioner under the Tender of Union to settle the affairs of Scotland, and on the death of Ireton he was appointed lord deputy of Ireland (January 1652). He made extensive preparations; parliament, however, reconstituted the Irish administration and Lambert refused to accept office on the new terms. He then began to oppose the Rump Parliament. In the Council of Officers he headed the party desiring representative government, as opposed to Harrison who favoured an oligarchy of &quot;God-fearing&quot; men, but both hated the Rump of the Long Parliament, and joined in urging Cromwell to dissolve it by force.

At the same time Lambert was consulted by the parliamentary leaders as to the possibility of dismissing Cromwell from his command, and on 15 March 1653 Cromwell refused to see him, speaking of him contemptuously as &quot;bottomless Lambert&quot;. On 20 April 1653, however, Lambert accompanied Cromwell when he dismissed the Council of State, on the same day as the forcible expulsion of the parliament.

Lambert now favoured the formation of a small executive council, to be followed by an elective parliament whose powers should be limited by a written instrument of government. As the ruling spirit in the Council of State, and the idol of the army, he was seen as a possible rival of Cromwell for the chief executive power, while the royalists for a short time had hopes of his support. He was invited, with Cromwell, Harrison and John Desborough, to sit in the nominated &quot;Barebones Parliament&quot; of 1653; and when the unpopularity of that assembly increased, Cromwell drew nearer to Lambert. In November 1653 Lambert presided over a meeting of officers, when the question of constitutional settlement was discussed, and a proposal made for the forcible expulsion of the nominated parliament. On 12 December 1653, the parliament resigned its powers into Cromwell&#x27;s hands, and on 13 December Lambert obtained the consent of the officers to the Instrument of Government, in the framing of which he had taken a lead. He was one of the seven officers nominated to seats in the council created by the Instrument.

In the foreign policy of the Protectorate Lambert called for alliance with Spain and war with France in 1653, and he firmly withstood Cromwell&#x27;s design for an expedition to the West Indies.

In the debates in parliament on the Instrument of Government in 1654 Lambert proposed that the office of Lord Protector should be made hereditary, but was defeated by a majority which included members of Cromwell&#x27;s family. In the parliament of this year, and again in 1656, Lord Lambert, as he was now styled, sat as member for the West Riding. He was one of the major-generals appointed in August 1655 to command the militia in the ten districts into which it was proposed to divide England, and who were to be responsible for the maintenance of order and the administration of the law in their several districts.

Lambert took a prominent part in the Committee of Council which drew up instructions to the administrative major-generals. He was the organiser of the system of police which these officers were to control. Samuel Gardiner conjectures that it was through divergence of opinion between the protector and Lambert in connection with these &quot;instructions&quot; that the estrangement between the two men began. At all events, although Lambert had himself at an earlier date requested Cromwell to take the royal dignity, when the proposal to declare Oliver king was started in parliament (February 1657) he at once opposed it.

A hundred officers headed by Charles Fleetwood and Lambert waited on the protector, and begged him to put a stop to the proceedings. Lambert was not convinced by Cromwell&#x27;s arguments, and their complete estrangement, personal as well as political, followed. On his refusal to take the oath of allegiance to the protector, Lambert was deprived of his commissions, receiving instead a pension of £2000 a year. He retired from public life to Wimbledon; but shortly before his own death Cromwell sought a reconciliation, and Lambert and his wife visited Cromwell at Whitehall.

When Richard Cromwell was proclaimed protector (3 September 1658), his chief difficulty lay with the army, over which he exercised no effective control. Lambert, though holding no military commission, was the most popular of the old Cromwellian generals with the rank and file of the army, and it was very generally believed that he would install himself in Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s seat of power. Richard Cromwell&#x27;s adherents tried to conciliate him, and the royalist leaders made overtures to him, even proposing that Charles II should marry Lambert&#x27;s daughter. Lambert at first gave a lukewarm support to Richard Cromwell, and took no part in the intrigues of the officers at Fleetwood&#x27;s residence, Wallingford House. He was a member of the Third Protectorate Parliament which met in January 1659, and when it was dissolved in April under compulsion of Fleetwood and Desborough, he was restored to his commands. He headed the deputation to Lenthall in May 1659 inviting the return of the Rump Parliament, which led to the tame retirement of Richard Cromwell; and he was appointed a member of the Committee of Safety and of the Council of State.

When the parliament, in an attempt to control the power of the army, withheld from Fleetwood the right of nominating officers, Lambert was named one of a council of seven charged with this duty. The parliament&#x27;s evident distrust of the soldiers caused much discontent in the army; while the absence of authority encouraged the royalists to make overt attempts to restore Charles II, the most serious of which, under Sir George Booth and the earl of Derby, was crushed by Lambert near Chester on 19 August 1659. He promoted a petition from his army that Fleetwood might be made lord-general and himself major-general. The republican party in the House took offence. The Commons (12 October 1659) cashiered Lambert and other officers, and retained Fleetwood as chief of a military council under the authority of the speaker. On the next day Lambert caused the doors of the House to be shut and the members kept out. On 26 October a new Committee of Safety was appointed, of which he was a member. He was also appointed major-general of all the forces in England and Scotland, Fleetwood being general.

Lambert was now sent with a large force to meet George Monck, who was in command of the English forces in Scotland, and either negotiate with him or force him to terms. Monck, however, marched southward. Lambert&#x27;s army began to melt away over various issues including lack of pay and lack of enthusiasm for the military regime, and he was kept in suspense by Monck till his whole army deserted and he returned to London almost alone. Monck marched to London unopposed. The excluded Presbyterian members were recalled. Lambert was sent to the Tower (3 March 1660), from which he escaped a month later. He descended a silk rope and aided by six men was taken away by barge. He tried to rekindle the civil war in favour of the Commonwealth by issuing a proclamation calling on all supporters of the &quot;Good Old Cause&quot; to rally on the battlefield of Edgehill. But he was recaptured on 22 April at Daventry by Colonel Richard Ingoldsby, a regicide who hoped to win a pardon by handing Lambert over to the new regime. He was kept imprisoned in the Tower of London and then transferred to Castle Cornet on the island Guernsey.

===Restoration===
On the Restoration Lambert was exempted from prosecution by an address of both Houses of the Convention Parliament to the king, but the Cavalier Parliament in 1662 charged him with high treason. In April 1662 General Lambert was, with Sir Henry Vane, brought to England and tried in June 1662. On 25 July a warrant was issued to Lord Hatton, the governor of Guernsey, to take into his custody &quot;the person of John Lambert, commonly called Colonel Lambert, and keep him a close prisoner as a condemned traitor until further orders&quot;. On 18 November following, directions were given from the king to Lord Hatton to &quot;give such liberty and indulgence to Colonel John Lambert within the precincts of the island as will consist with the security of his person&quot;.

==Later life==
In 1662 Lambert was imprisoned in Guernsey. In 1667 he was transferred to Drake&#x27;s Island in Plymouth Sound, at the entrance to the Hamoaze, and he died there during the severe winter of 1683–84. The site of his grave is now lost but he was laid to rest at St Andrews Church in Plymouth on 28 March 1684.

==Legacy==
He was the author of the Instrument of Government, the first written constitution in the world codifying sovereign powers. The Instrument of Government was replaced in May 1657 by England&#x27;s second, last, and extinct codified constitution, the Humble Petition and Advice.

It has been said that Lambert&#x27;s nature had more in common with the royalist than with the puritan spirit. Vain and ambitious, he believed that Cromwell could not stand without him; and when Cromwell was dead, he imagined himself entitled to succeed him. As a soldier he was far more than a fighting general and possessed many of the qualities of a great general. He was an able writer and speaker, and an accomplished negotiator and took pleasure in quiet and domestic pursuits. He learnt his love of gardening from Lord Fairfax, who was also his master in the art of war. He painted flowers, besides cultivating them, and was accused by Lucy Hutchinson of &quot;dressing his flowers in his garden and working at the needle with his wife and his maids&quot;.

<doc id="199873" wikidata="Q297726" url="?curid=199873" title="Hippolyte Taine">
<text>Hippolyte Adolphe Taine (21 April 1828 – 5 March 1893) was a French historian, critic and philosopher. He was the chief theoretical influence on French naturalism, a major proponent of sociological positivism and one of the first practitioners of historicist criticism. Literary historicism as a critical movement has been said to originate with him. Taine is also remembered for his attempts to provide a scientific account of literature.

Taine had a profound effect on French literature; Maurice Baring wrote in the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; that &quot;the tone which pervades the works of Zola, Bourget and Maupassant can be immediately attributed to the influence we call Taine&#x27;s.&quot; Out of the trauma of 1871, Taine has been said by one scholar to have &quot;forged the architectural structure of modern French right-wing historiography.&quot;

==Early years==

Taine was born in Vouziers into a fairly prosperous Ardennes family. His father, a lawyer, his uncle, and his grandfather encouraged him to read eclectically and offered him art and music lessons.

In 1841, Taine, then aged 13, lost his father and was sent to a boarding school in Paris, in the Institution Mathé, whose classes were conducted in the Collège Bourbon, located in the Batignolles district. He excelled in his studies and in 1847 obtained two Baccalauréat degrees (Science and Philosophy) and received the honorary prize of the concours. He was awarded a first in the entrance examination of the letters section of the École Normale Supérieure, to which he was admitted in November 1848. Among the 24 students in the letters section, he is the classmate of Francisque Sarcey (who, in his &quot;Souvenirs de jeunesse&quot; (&quot;Memories of Youth&quot;) painted a portrait of young Hippolyte at the Rue d&#x27;Ulm campus) and Edmond About. But his attitude—he had a reputation for stubbornness—and his intellectual independence from then fashionable ideas— embodied by Victor Cousin—caused him to fail the examination for the national Concours d&#x27;Agrégation in philosophy in 1851. After his essay on sensation was rejected, he abandoned the social sciences and turned to literature. Having relocated outside Paris, he took up teaching positions in Nevers and Poitiers, during which time he continued his intellectual development. In 1853, he obtained a doctorate at the Sorbonne. His thesis, &quot;Essai sur les fables de La Fontaine&quot;, would later be published in revised form in 1861. His subsequent &quot;Essay on Livy&quot; won a prize from the Académie Française in 1854.

Taine adopted the positivist and scientist ideas that emerged around this time.

After defending his doctorate, he was automatically transferred to Besançon, but he refused this assignment. He settled first in Paris, where he enrolled in the medical school. From there, he went on a medical cure in the Pyrénées in 1855, after which he wrote his famous &quot;Voyage aux Pyrénées&quot;, and began contributing numerous philosophical, literary, and historical articles to the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot; and the &quot;Journal des débats&quot;, two major newspapers at the time.

He then took leave and travelled to England, where he spent six weeks. In 1863 he published his &quot;History of English Literature&quot; in five volumes. Bishop Félix Dupanloup, who had made it his career to oppose the election of agnostic intellectuals to the Académie Française, opposed the latter&#x27;s awarding Taine a prize for this work.
In 1868, he married Thérèse Denuelle, daughter of Alexandre Denuelle. They had two children: Geneviève, wife of Louis Paul-Dubois, and Émile.

The immense success of his work allowed him, not only to live by his pen, but also to be named professor of the History of Art and Aesthetics at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and professor of history and German at the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr. He also taught at Oxford (1871), where he was a Doctor in Law. In 1878, he was elected member of the Académie Française by 20 out of the 26 voters.
Taine was interested in many subjects, including art, literature, but especially history. Deeply shaken by the defeat of 1870, as well as by the insurrection (and violent repression) of the Paris Commune, Taine became fully devoted to his major historical work, &quot;The Origins of Contemporary France&quot; (1875–1893), on which he worked until his death, and which had a significant impact. Conceived by Taine with the aim of understanding the France of his day, the six-volume work analysed the causes of the French Revolution from an original, long-term perspective. In particular, Taine denounced the artificiality of the revolution&#x27;s political constructions (the excessively abstract and rational ideas of Robespierre, for example), which, in his mind, violently contradicted the natural and slow growth of the institutions of a State.

In 1885, while visiting the Hospital de la Salpêtrière, Taine and Joseph Delboeuf attended a session of hypnotism in which Jean-Martin Charcot induced vesications (blistering) by suggestion.

Taine died on 5 March 1893. He was buried in the Roc de Chère National Nature Reserve, Talloires, on the shores of Lake Annecy. Taine had bought the Boringes property in Menthon-Saint-Bernard (in Haute-Savoie), in order to work there every summer, and had served as councillor of the commune.

==Assessment==

Taine&#x27;s writing on the Revolution has remained popular in France. While admired by liberals like Anatole France, it has served to inform the conservative view of the Revolution, since Taine rejected its principles as well as the French Constitution of 1793, on account of their being dishonestly presented to the people. He argued that the Jacobins had responded to the centralisation of the ancien régime with even greater centralisation and favoured the individualism of his concepts of regionalism and nation. Taine&#x27;s alternative to rationalist liberalism influenced the social policies of the Third Republic.

On the other hand, Taine has likewise received criticism from across the political spectrum, his politics being idiosyncratic, complex, and difficult to define. Among others, attacks came from the Marxist historian George Rudé, a specialist in the French Revolution and in &#x27;history from below&#x27;, on account of Taine&#x27;s view of the crowd; and from the Freudian Peter Gay who described Taine&#x27;s reaction to the Jacobins as stigmatisation. Yet, Alfred Cobban, who advocated a revisionist view of the French Revolution in opposition to the orthodox Marxist school, considered Taine&#x27;s account of the French Revolution &quot;a brilliant polemic&quot;. Taine&#x27;s vision of the Revolution stands in contrast to the Marxist interpretations that gained prominence in the 20th century, as in the works of Albert Mathiez, Georges Lefebvre, and Albert Soboul, before the revisionist accounts of Alfred Cobban and François Furet.

Notwithstanding academic politics, when Alphonse Aulard, a historian of the French Revolution, analysed Taine&#x27;s text, he showed that the numerous facts and examples presented by Taine to support his account proved substantially correct; few errors were found by Aulard—fewer than in his own texts, as reported by Augustin Cochin.

In his other writings Taine is known for his attempt to provide a scientific account of literature, a project that has linked him to sociological positivists, although there were important differences. In his view, the work of literature was the product of the author&#x27;s environment, and an analysis of that environment could yield a perfect understanding of that work; this stands in contrast with the view that the work of literature is the spontaneous creation of genius. Taine based his analysis on categories such as &quot;nation&quot;, &quot;environment&quot; or &quot;situation&quot;, and &quot;time&quot;. Armin Koller has written that in this Taine drew heavily from the philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder, although this has been insufficiently recognised, while the Spanish writer Emilia Pardo Bazán has suggested that a crucial predecessor to Taine&#x27;s idea was Germaine de Staël&#x27;s work on the relationship between art and society. Nationalist literary movements and post-modern critics alike have made use of Taine&#x27;s concepts, the former to argue for their unique and distinct place in literature and the latter to deconstruct the texts with regards to the relationship between literature and social history.

Taine was criticised, including by Émile Zola who owed a great deal to him, for not taking sufficiently into account the individuality of the artist. Zola argued that an artist&#x27;s temperament could lead him to make unique artistic choices distinct from the environment that shaped him, and gave Édouard Manet as a principal example. Gustave Lanson argued that Taine&#x27;s environmental determinism could not account for his genius.

==Influence==

Taine&#x27;s influence on French intellectual culture and literature was significant. He had a special relationship, in particular, with Émile Zola. As critic Philip Walker says of Zola, &quot;In page after page, including many of his most memorable writings, we are presented with what amounts to a mimesis of the interplay between sensation and imagination which Taine studied at great length and out of which, he believed, emerges the world of the mind.&quot; The Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno was fascinated with both Zola and Taine early on (although he eventually concluded that Taine&#x27;s influence on literature had been negative).
French fiction writers Paul Bourget and Guy de Maupassant were also heavily influenced by Taine.

Taine shared a correspondence with the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who later referred to him in &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; as &quot;the first of living historians&quot;. He was also the subject of Stefan Zweig&#x27;s doctoral thesis, &quot;The Philosophy of Hippolyte Taine.&quot; Taine was also read by Peter Kropotkin, who described him as truly understanding the French Revolution, because he &quot;studied the movements preceding the revolution of July 14,&quot; or as he quoted Taine himself, &quot;I know of three hundred outbreaks before July 14.&quot;

<text>Eugène Auguste Ernest Havet (April 11, 1813 – December 21, 1889), French scholar, was born in Paris. He was the father of Pierre Antoine Louis Havet and Julien Havet.

Educated at the Lycée Saint-Louis and the Ecole Normale, he was for many years before his death professor of Latin eloquence at the Collège de France.

His two capital works were a commentary on the works of Pascal, &quot;Pensées de Pascal, publiées dans le texte authentique, avec un commentaire suivi et une étude littéraire&quot; (1852; 2nd ed. 2 vols., 1881), and &quot;Le Christianisme et ses origines&quot; (4 vols., 1871–1884), the chief thesis of which was that Christianity owed more to Greek philosophy than to the writings of the Hebrew prophets.

<text>Eugen Fischer (5 July 1874 – 9 July 1967) was a German professor of medicine, anthropology, and eugenics, and a member of the Nazi Party. He served as director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics, and also served as rector of the Frederick William University of Berlin.

Fischer&#x27;s ideas informed the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 which served to justify the Nazi Party&#x27;s belief in German racial superiority to other &quot;races&quot;, and especially the Jews. Adolf Hitler read Fischer&#x27;s work while he was imprisoned in 1923 and he used Fischer&#x27;s eugenic notions to support his vision of a pure Aryan society in his manifesto &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; (&quot;My Struggle&quot;).

After the war, Fischer completed his memoirs. It is believed that in them he lessened his role in the genocidal programme of Nazi Germany. He died in 1967.

==Life==
Fischer was born in Karlsruhe, Grand Duchy of Baden, in 1874. He studied medicine, folkloristics, history, anatomy, and anthropology in Berlin, Freiburg and Munich. In 1918, he joined the Anatomical Institute in Freiburg, part of the University of Freiburg.

==Early work==
In 1906, Fischer conducted field research in German South West Africa (now Namibia). He studied the Basters, offspring of German or Boer men and Black African (Khoekhoe) women in that area. His study concluded with a call to prevent the production of a mixed race by the prohibition of mixed marriages such as those which he had studied. It included human experimentation on the Herero and Namaqua people. He argued that while the existing &quot;Mischling&quot; descendants of the mixed marriages might be useful for Germany, he recommended that they should not continue to reproduce. His recommendations were followed and by 1912 interracial marriage was prohibited throughout the German colonies. As a precursor to his experiments on Jews in Nazi Germany, he collected bones and skulls for his studies, in part from medical experimentation on African prisoners of war in Namibia during the Herero and Nama genocide. Fischer also sterilized Herero women.

His ideas which were related to the maintenance of the apparent purity of races, influenced future German Nazi legislation on race, including the Nuremberg laws.

In 1927, Fischer was a speaker at the World Population Conference which was held in Geneva, Switzerland. In the same year, Fischer became the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics (KWI-A), a role for which he&#x27;d been recommended the prior year by Erwin Baur.

==Nazi Germany==
In the years from 1937–1938 Fischer and his colleagues analysed 600 children in Nazi Germany who were descended from French-African soldiers who occupied western areas of Germany after the First World War and were known as the Rhineland bastards; the children were subsequently subjected to sterilization.
Fischer did not officially join the Nazi Party until 1940. However, he was influential with National Socialists early on. Adolf Hitler read his two-volume work, &quot;Principles of Human Heredity and Race Hygiene&quot; (first published in 1921 and co-written by Erwin Baur and Fritz Lenz) while incarcerated in 1923 and used its ideas in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. He also wrote &quot;The Rehoboth Bastards and the Problem of Miscegenation among Humans&quot; (1913) (), a field study which provided context for later racial debates, influenced German colonial legislation. Nuremberg laws.

Under the Nazi regime, Fischer developed the physiological specifications such as skull dimensions which were used to determine racial origins, and he developed the Fischer–Saller scale for hair colour. He and the members of his team experimented on Gypsies and African-Germans, drawing their blood and measuring their skulls. After directing the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics, he was succeeded by Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer, who tutored Josef Mengele when he was active at Auschwitz.

In 1933, Fischer signed the &quot;Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State&quot;. In the same year, Adolf Hitler appointed him rector of the Frederick William University of Berlin, now Humboldt University. Fischer retired from the university in 1942.
Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer was a student of Fischer.

Efforts to return the Namibian skulls which were taken by Fischer were started with an investigation which was conducted by the University of Freiburg in 2011 and they were completed with the return of the skulls in March 2014.

In 1944, Fischer intervened in an attempt to get his friend Martin Heidegger, the Nazi philosopher, released from service in the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; militia. However, Heidegger had already been released from service when Fischer&#x27;s letter arrived.

<text>USS &quot;Lexington&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS/CVT/AVT-16) is an built during World War II for the United States Navy. Originally intended to be named &quot;Cabot&quot;, the new aircraft carrier was renamed while under construction to commemorate the recently-lost , becoming the sixth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name in honor of the Battle of Lexington.

&quot;Lexington&quot; was commissioned in February 1943 and saw extensive service through the Pacific War. For much of her service, she acted as the flagship for Admiral Marc Mitscher, and led the Fast Carrier Task Force through their battles across the Pacific. She was the recipient of 11 battle stars and the Presidential Unit Citation. Following the war, &quot;Lexington&quot; was decommissioned, but was modernized and reactivated in the early 1950s, being reclassified as an attack carrier (CVA). Later, she was reclassified as an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). In her second career, she operated both in the Atlantic/Mediterranean and the Pacific, but spent most of her time, nearly 30 years, in Pensacola, Florida, as a training carrier (CVT).

&quot;Lexington&quot; was decommissioned in 1991, with an active service life longer than any other &quot;Essex&quot;-class ship. Following her decommissioning, she was donated for use as a museum ship in Corpus Christi, Texas. In 2003, &quot;Lexington&quot; was designated a National Historic Landmark. Though her surviving sister ships , , and carry lower hull numbers, &quot;Lexington&quot; was laid down and commissioned earlier, making &quot;Lexington&quot; the oldest remaining fleet carrier in the world.

==Service history==

===World War II===
The ship was laid down as &quot;Cabot&quot; on 15 July 1941 by Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. In May 1942, , which had been built in the same shipyard two decades earlier, was sunk at the Battle of the Coral Sea. In June, workers at the shipyard submitted a request to Navy Secretary Frank Knox to change the name of a carrier currently under construction there to &quot;Lexington&quot;. Knox agreed to the proposal and &quot;Cabot&quot; was renamed &quot;Lexington&quot; on 16 June 1942, the fifth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name of the Revolutionary War Battle of Lexington. She was launched on 23 September 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Theodore Douglas Robinson. &quot;Lexington&quot; was commissioned on 17 February 1943, with Captain Felix Stump in command. After a shakedown cruise in the Caribbean, &quot;Lexington&quot; sailed via the Panama Canal to join the Pacific fleet.

One of the carrier&#x27;s first casualties was 1939 Heisman Trophy winner Nile Kinnick. During the ship&#x27;s initial voyage (to the Caribbean) in 1943, Kinnick and other naval fliers were conducting training flights off her deck. The Grumman F4F Wildcat flown by Kinnick developed a serious oil leak while airborne and was unable to return to &quot;Lexington&quot;, crashing into the sea four miles from the ship. Neither Kinnick nor his plane were recovered.
&quot;Lexington&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 9 August 1943, and participated in a raid on Tarawa air bases in late September, followed by a raid against Wake Island in October, before returning to Pearl Harbor to prepare for the Gilbert Islands operation. From 19 to 24 November, she made searches and flew sorties in the Marshalls, covering the landings in the Gilberts. Her aviators downed 29 enemy aircraft on 23 and 24 November.

====Kwajalein raid====
&quot;Lexington&quot; sailed to raid Kwajalein on 4 December. Her morning strike destroyed the , damaged two cruisers, and accounted for 30 enemy aircraft. The carrier was attacked at midday by six &quot;Tenzan&quot; Torpedo bombers of the 531st Kōkūtai, two were shot down by flak while attacking the carrier, but the task force was ordered not to open fire at night as Admiral Charles Pownall then in command believed it would give their position away. He was later replaced.

At 19:20 that night, a major air attack began while the task force was under way off Kwajalein. At 23:22, parachute flares from Japanese planes silhouetted the carrier, and 10 minutes later, she was hit by a torpedo on the starboard side, knocking out her steering gear. Nine people were killed, two on the fantail and seven in the chief petty officers&#x27; mess room, which was a repair party station during general quarters. Four members of the affected repair party survived because they were sitting on a couch that apparently absorbed the shock of the explosion. Settling by the stern, the carrier began circling to port amidst dense clouds of smoke pouring from ruptured tanks aft. To maintain water-tight integrity, damage control crews were ordered to seal the damaged compartments and welded them shut, applying heavy steel plates where needed. An emergency hand-operated steering unit was quickly devised, and &quot;Lexington&quot; made Pearl Harbor for emergency repairs, arriving on 9 December. She reached Bremerton, Washington, on 22 December for full repairs, completed on 20 February 1944. The error in judgment concerning opening fire at night was never repeated, as thereafter gun crews were ordered to open fire anytime the ship came under attack. Following this attack, the ship was reported as sunk by Japan&#x27;s Tokyo Rose, the first of several such assertions.

====Battle of the Philippine Sea====
&quot;Lexington&quot; returned to Majuro in time to be present when Rear Admiral Mitscher took command of the newly formed Task Force 58 (TF 58) on 8 March. Mitscher took &quot;Lexington&quot; as his flagship, and after a warm-up strike against Mille, the Fast Carrier Task Force began a series of operations against the Japanese positions in the central Pacific. She supported Army landings at Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) on 13 April, and then raided the strongpoint of Truk on 28 April. Heavy counterattacks left &quot;Lexington&quot; untouched, her planes splashing 17 enemy fighters, but for the second time, Japanese propaganda announced her sunk.

A surprise fighter strike on Saipan on 11 June nearly eliminated all air opposition over the island, then battered it from the air for the next five days. On 16 June, &quot;Lexington&quot; fought off a fierce attack by Japanese torpedo bombers based on Guam, once again emerging unhurt, but &#x27;sunk&#x27; a third time by propaganda pronouncements. As Japanese opposition to the Marianas operation provoked the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19–20 June, &quot;Lexington&quot; played a major role in TF 58&#x27;s great victory in what was later called the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;. With over 300 enemy aircraft destroyed the first day, and a carrier, a tanker, and a destroyer sunk the second day, American aviators nearly knocked Japanese naval aviation out of the war; with the planes went the trained and experienced pilots without whom Japan could not continue air warfare at sea.

Using Eniwetok as her base, &quot;Lexington&quot; sent aircraft on sorties over Guam and against the Palaus and Bonins into August. She arrived in the Carolinas on 7 September for three days of strikes against Yap and Ulithi, then began attacks on Mindanao, the Visayas, the Manila area, and shipping along the west coast of Luzon, preparing for the coming assault on Leyte. Her task force then blasted Okinawa on 10 October and Formosa two days later to destroy bases from which opposition to the Philippines campaign might be launched. She was again unscathed through the air battle fought after the Formosa assault.

====Battle of Leyte Gulf====
Now covering the Leyte landings, &quot;Lexington&quot;″s aircraft scored importantly in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the climactic American naval victory over Japan. While the carrier came under constant enemy attack in the engagement, she was not damaged during the main battle. In exchange her aircraft served in the battle of the Sibuyan Sea, where they assisted in sinking the Japanese &quot;super battleship&quot; , one of the two largest and most powerful battleships in the world (alongside her sistership &quot;Yamato&quot;) and scored hits on three cruisers on 24 October, including a torpedo hit that crippled the heavy cruiser &quot;Myōkō,&quot; forcing her out of the battle alongside two destroyers to escort her. 

The next day &quot;Lexington&quot;″s aircraft served in the battle off Cape Engano against Japanese aircraft carriers. With aircraft, they sank the light carrier and in conjunction with aircraft crippled the light carrier (later finished off by a US cruiser task force consisting of , , , and ). Meanwhile, her aircraft alone sank the fleet carrier . During the battle of the Coral Sea on May 8th 1942, &quot;Zuikaku&quot; air group landed two torpedo hits that were the primary reason behind &quot;Lexington&quot; (CV-2)&#x27;s sinking, thus &quot;Lexington&quot; avenged her fallen predecessor. Later in the day, alongside aircraft, &quot;Lexington&quot; aircraft sank the light carrier .

As the retiring Japanese were pursued, her aircraft then sank the heavy crusier with four torpedo hits on 5 November off Luzon. Later that day, &quot;Lexington&quot; was introduced to the &quot;kamikaze&quot; as a flaming Japanese aircraft crashed near her island, destroying most of the island structure and spraying fire in all directions. Within 20 minutes, major blazes were under control, and she was able to continue normal flight actions, as well as shooting down a &quot;kamikaze&quot; heading for . On 9 November, &quot;Lexington&quot; arrived in Ulithi to repair battle damage while hearing that Tokyo once again claimed her sunk. &quot;Lexington&quot; suffered 50 killed and 132 wounded in this attack.

Chosen as the flagship for Task Group 58.2 (TG 58.2) on 11 December, she struck at the airfields of Luzon and Formosa during the first nine days of January 1945, encountering little enemy opposition. The task force then entered the South China Sea to strike enemy shipping and air installations. Strikes were flown against Saipan, Camranh Bay in then Indochina, Hong Kong, the Pescadores, and Formosa. Task force planes sank four merchant ships and four escorts in one convoy and destroyed at least 12 in another, at Camranh Bay on 12 January. Leaving the China Sea on 20 January, &quot;Lexington&quot; sailed north to strike Formosa again on 21 January and Okinawa again on 22 January. After replenishing at Ulithi, TG 58.2 sailed on 10 February to hit airfields near Tokyo on 16 February 1945, and on 17 February to minimize opposition to the Iwo Jima landings on 19 February. &quot;Lexington&quot; flew close support for the assaulting troops from 19 to 22 February, then sailed for further strikes against the Japanese home islands and the Nansei Shoto before heading for overhaul at Puget Sound.

====Rear Admiral Sprague&#x27;s task force====
&quot;Lexington&quot; was combat-bound again on 22 May, sailing via Alameda and Pearl Harbor for San Pedro Bay, Leyte, where she joined Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague&#x27;s task force for the final round of air strikes which battered the Japanese home islands from July-15 August, when the last strike was ordered to jettison its bombs and return to &quot;Lexington&quot; on receiving word of the Japanese surrender. During this period, she had launched attacks on Honshū and Hokkaidō airfields, and Yokosuka and Kure naval bases to destroy the remnants of the Japanese fleet. In the actions at Kure, F4U-1D Corsairs of VBF94 flying off &quot;Lexington&quot;, sank the hybrid battleship/aircraft carrier &quot;Ise&quot;. Flying against heavy enemy fire, squadron commander Lester Wall Jr. dropped a 1000lb bomb down her stack, exploding her boilers and breaking her keel in a conflagration matching that of the destruction of the at Pearl Harbor four years earlier. The Lt. Cmdr. and several men in his squadron were awarded the Navy Cross for this action. She had also flown bombing attacks on industrial targets in the Tokyo area.

After hostilities ended, her aircraft continued to fly air patrols over Japan. The previously mentioned Lt.Cmdr. Wall first located and then led in supply drops to prisoner-of-war camps on Honshū that had been abandoned by the Japanese. He was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this mission. In December, she was used to ferry home servicemen in what was known as Operation Magic Carpet, arriving in San Francisco on 16 December.

===After the war===

&quot;Lexington&quot; was decommissioned at Bremerton on 23 April 1947, and entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet. While in reserve, she was designated attack carrier CVA-16 on 1 October 1952. In September 1953, &quot;Lexington&quot; entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. She received the &quot;Essex&quot;-class SCB-27C and SCB-125 conversions in one refit, being then able to operate the most modern jet aircraft. The most visible distinguishing features were an angled flight deck, steam catapults, a new island, and the hurricane bow. &quot;Lexington&quot; was recommissioned on 15 August 1955, Captain A. S. Heyward Jr. in command. Assigned to San Diego as her home port, she operated off California until May 1956, sailing then for a six-month deployment with the 7th Fleet. She based on Yokosuka for exercises, maneuvers, and search and rescue missions off the coast of China, and called at major Far Eastern ports until returning to San Diego on 20 December. She next trained Air Group 12, which deployed with her on the next 7th Fleet deployment. Arriving at Yokosuka on 1 June 1957, &quot;Lexington&quot; embarked Rear Admiral H. D. Riley, Commander Carrier Division 1, and sailed as his flagship until returning to San Diego on 17 October.

Following overhaul at Bremerton, her refresher training was interrupted by the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis; on 14 July 1958, she was ordered to embark Air Group 21 at San Francisco and sail to reinforce the 7th Fleet off Taiwan, arriving on station on 7 August and returning to San Diego on 19 December. Now the first carrier whose planes were armed with AGM-12 Bullpup guided missiles, &quot;Lexington&quot; left San Francisco on 26 April 1959 for another tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. She was on standby alert during the Laotian crisis of late August and September. Following this, she exercised with British naval forces before returning to San Diego, arriving on 2 December. In early 1960, she underwent an overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

&quot;Lexington&quot;″s next Far Eastern tour began late in 1960, and was extended well into 1961 by renewed tension in Laos. Returning to west coast operations, she was ordered in January 1962 to prepare to relieve as aviation training carrier in the Gulf of Mexico, and she was redesignated CVS-16 on 1 October 1962. However, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, she resumed duty as an attack carrier, and she did not relieve &quot;Antietam&quot; until 29 December 1962 at Pensacola, Florida.

Into 1969, &quot;Lexington&quot; operated out of her home port, Pensacola, as well as Corpus Christi, qualifying student aviators and maintaining the high state of training of both active-duty and reserve naval aviators. Her work became of increasing significance as she prepared the men vital to the Navy and Marine Corps operations over Vietnam, where naval aviation played a major role. &quot;Lexington&quot; marked her 200,000th arrested landing on 17 October 1967, was redesignated CVT-16 on 1 January 1969 and was redesignated again as AVT-16 on 1 July 1978. She continued as a training carrier for the next 22 years until she was relieved by , and &quot;Lexington&quot; was decommissioned and struck on 8 November 1991.

On 18 August 1980, &quot;Lexington&quot; became the first aircraft carrier in United States naval history to have women stationed aboard as crew members. On 29 October 1989, a student naval aviator lost control of his T-2 training aircraft after an aborted attempt to land on &quot;Lexington&quot;″s flight deck. The aircraft inverted and hit the island with its left wing, killing four crew members (including the pilot of the plane who had begun an ejection sequence) and one civilian maintenance worker and injuring seventeen. The island suffered no major damage, and fires from the burning fuel were extinguished within 15 minutes. &quot;Lexington&quot; was the final &quot;Essex&quot;-class carrier in commission, after had been decommissioned in 1976.

==USS &quot;Lexington&quot; Museum==
On 26 November 1991, the US Navy turned &quot;Lexington&quot; over to the City of Corpus Christi. On 15 June 1992, the ship was donated as a museum and now operates as the &quot;USS &quot;Lexington&quot; Museum on the Bay&quot; at 2914 North Shoreline Boulevard, Corpus Christi, Texas. A MEGAtheater (similar to IMAX) was added in the forward aircraft elevator space. &quot;Lexington&quot; was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2003. The ship is carefully maintained, and areas of the ship previously off-limits are becoming open to the public every few years. One of the most recent examples of this is the catapult room.

The ship&#x27;s World War II-era gun battery is also being partially restored using guns salvaged from scrapped ships. Most notable among these are 5&quot;/38 DP gun turrets saved from the scrapping of the heavy cruiser . They have been mounted in the approximate locations where similar mounts once existed as part of the ship&#x27;s original World War II-era fit. After the coast guard cutter &quot;Dauntless&quot;&#x27; overhaul, her 3&quot;/50cal gun was put on display onboard &quot;Lexington&quot;.

On 5 February 2010, &quot;Lexington&quot; hosted its 17th annual &quot;Stagedoor Canteen&quot;.

The National Naval Aviation Museum, at Naval Air Station Pensacola, has a small carrier deck mock-up, whose flight deck is constructed from deck boards salvaged from &quot;Lexington&quot;.

In 1975 &quot;Lexington&quot; served as a filming location at sea the feature movie &quot;Midway&quot; and again in 1987 for the TV miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;. In both cases, she was altered to the extent possible to resemble other vessels, ( in &quot;Midway&quot; and in &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;) by adding antiaircraft cannons and operating World War II-vintage Navy aircraft. &quot;Lexington&quot; was also used (though tied up to her pier) for filming of the 2001 film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, where she was altered to resemble a Japanese carrier, as well as .

In July 2007, the popular TV show &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; filmed aboard &quot;Lexington&quot;, looking for evidence of ghosts, and in December 2009, she was the subject of an episode of &quot;Ghost Lab&quot;, on the Discovery Channel.

In 2014, Pepsi used the ship to film a commercial in preparation for the 2015 Super Bowl. The commercial, titled &quot;Operation Halftime,&quot; featured country-music singer Blake Shelton performing for veterans and their families.

==Awards==
The crew of &quot;Lexington&quot; received the Presidential Unit Citation for heroism in action against enemy Japanese forces, 11 battle stars for major engagements during World War II service, and other awards.

<text>Edmond François Valentin About (14 February 182816 January 1885) was a French novelist, publicist and journalist.

==Biography==
About was born at Dieuze, in the Moselle &quot;département&quot; in the Lorraine region of France. 

In 1848, he entered the École Normale, taking second place in the annual competition for admission in which Hippolyte Taine came first. Among his college contemporaries, besides Taine, were Francisque Sarcey, Challemel-Lacour and Prevost-Paradol. Of them all, About was considered the most highly vitalized, exuberant, brilliant and &quot;undisciplined&quot;. It is said that one of his schoolmasters told him &quot;You will never be more than a little Voltaire&quot; 

At the end of his college career, he joined the French school in Athens, but claimed that he had never intended to follow the professorial career for which the École Normale was a preparation, and in 1853 he returned to France and devoted himself to literature and journalism.

==Career==
He made his name as an entertaining anti-clerical writer. The satirical &quot;Le Roi des montagnes&quot; (1856; translated into English by Mary Louise Booth as &quot;The King of the Mountains&quot;, and by Tom Taylor as &quot;The Brigand and His Banker&quot;, for a dramatized version) is the best-known of his novels. 

In Greece, About had noticed that there was a curious understanding between the brigands and police: brigandage was becoming almost a safe and respectable industry. About pushed this idea to invent the story of a brigand chief who converts his business into a registered joint-stock company.
About&#x27;s commentary on modern Greece, &quot;La Grèce contemporaine&quot; (1854), was an immediate success. But his &quot;Tolla&quot; (1855), the story of a young Parisian actress, gave rise to charges of drawing too freely on an earlier Italian novel, &quot;Vittoria Savelli&quot; (1841). This aroused prejudice against him, and he was the object of numerous attacks. The &quot;Lettres d&#x27;un bon jeune homme&quot;, written to the &quot;Figaro&quot; under the signature of &quot;Valentin de Quevilly&quot;, provoked more animosities. During the next few years, he wrote novels, stories, a play (which failed), a book-pamphlet on the Roman question, many pamphlets on other subjects of the day, innumerable newspaper articles, some art criticisms, rejoinders to the attacks of his enemies, and popular manuals of political economy, &quot;L&#x27;A B C du travailleur&quot; (1868), &quot;Le progrès&quot; (1864). His more serious novels include &quot;Madelon&quot; (1863), &quot;L&#x27;Infâme&quot; (1867), the three that form the trilogy of the &quot;Vieille Roche&quot; (1866), and &quot;Le roman d&#x27;un brave homme&quot; (1880) – a kind of counterblast to the view of the French workman presented in Émile Zola&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot;. He is best remembered as a farceur, for the books &quot;Le nez d&#x27;un notaire&quot; (1862); &quot;Le roi des montagnes&quot; (1856); &quot;L&#x27;homme à l&#x27;oreille cassée&quot; (1862); &quot;Trente et quarante&quot; (1858); &quot;Le cas de M. Guérin&quot; (1862; see Georges Maurice de Guérin).

He was initiated at the Saint-Jean de Jérusalem Grand Orient de France lodge in Nancy on 7 March 1862. He wrote several articles against Masonic side degrees, a point of view that was common among French leftwing freemasons.

About&#x27;s attitude towards the empire was friendly but critical. He greeted the liberal ministry of Émile Ollivier at the beginning of 1870 with delight, and welcomed the Franco-Prussian War. But as a result of the war he lost his beloved home in Alsace, which he had purchased in 1858 out of the fruits of his earlier literary successes. With the fall of the empire, he became a republican, and threw himself into battle against conservative reactionaries. From 1872 to about 1877, his paper, the &quot;XIXe Siècle&quot; (&quot;19th century&quot;), became a power in the land. His political career, however, failed to advance further.

On 23 January 1884, he was elected a member of the Académie française, but died at age 66 before taking his seat. His grave at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris includes a sculpture by Gustave Crauck.

<text>The wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax) also known as the eaglehawk, is the largest bird of prey in the continent of Australia. It is also found in southern New Guinea to the north and is distributed as far south as the state of Tasmania. Adults of the species have long, broad wings, fully feathered legs, an unmistakable wedge-shaped tail, an elongated upper mandible, a strong beak and powerful feet. The wedge-tailed eagle is one of 12 species of large, predominantly dark-coloured booted eagles in the genus &quot;Aquila&quot; found worldwide. Genetic research has clearly indicated that the wedge-tailed eagle is fairly closely related to other, generally large members of the &quot;Aquila&quot; genus. A large brown-to-black bird of prey, it has a maximum reported wingspan of and a length of up to .

The wedge-tailed eagle is one of its native continent&#x27;s most generalised birds of prey. They reside in most habitats present in Australia, ranging from desert and semi-desert to plains to mountainous areas to forest, even sometimes tropical rainforests. Preferred habitats, however, tend towards those that have a fairly varied topography including rocky areas, some open terrain and native woodlots such as &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; stands.

The wedge-tailed eagle is one of the world&#x27;s most powerful avian predators. Although a true generalist, which hunts a wide range of prey, including birds, reptiles and, rarely, other taxa, the species is, by and large, a mammal predator. The introduction of the European rabbit (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;) has been a boon to the wedge-tailed eagle and they hunt these and other invasive species in large volume, although the wedge-tailed eagle otherwise generally lives off of marsupials, including many surprisingly large macropods. Additionally, wedge-tailed eagles often eat carrion, especially while young. The species tends to pair for several years, possibly mating for life.
Wedge-tailed eagles usually construct a large stick nest in an ample tree, normally the largest in a stand, and typically lay two eggs, although sometimes one to four. Usually, breeding efforts manage to produce one or two fledglings which, after a few months more, tend to disperse widely. Nesting failures are usually attributable to human interference, such as logging activity and other alterations, which both degrade habitats and cause disturbances. The species is known to be highly sensitive to human disturbance at the nest, which may lead to abandonment of the young.

Although historically heavily persecuted by humans through poisoning and shooting, mostly for alleged predation on sheep, wedge-tailed eagles have proved to be exceptionally resilient, and their numbers have quickly rebounded to being similar or even higher numbers than before European colonisation, thanks in part to humans inadvertently providing several food sources, such as rabbits and a large volume of roadkill.

==Taxonomy==

The species was first described in 1801 by the English ornithologist John Latham, under the binomial name &quot;Vultur audax&quot;. At one time, the wedge-tailed eagle was classified in it is own monotypical genus &quot;Uroaetus&quot;, perhaps due to its unique form.

Today, the genus &quot;Vultur&quot; is used only for a completely unrelated bird of the New World vulture family, the Andean condor (&quot;Vultur gryphus&quot;). The specific scientific name for the species, &quot;audax&quot;, is derived from the Latin &quot;audax&quot;, meaning &quot;bold&quot;, indicative of their perceived disposition, perhaps when hunting, although the species is, in general, highly wary, and even timid, around humans.

However, the species is quite similar in many aspects of its morphology, appearance, behaviour and life history, to other species in the &quot;Aquila&quot; genus. The eagles of the &quot;Aquila&quot; genus are part of the subfamily Aquilinae, within the larger Accipitridae family. The subfamily is commonly referred to as booted eagles or sometimes as true eagles. Those species may be distinguished from most other accipitrids by the feathering covering their legs, regardless of distribution. With some 39 or so species, the Aquilinae is present on every continent except Antarctica.

By a variety of phylogenetic testing, largely via Mitochondrial DNA and Nuclear DNA genes, it has been determined that the wedge-tailed eagle clusters with certain other &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles. The species found to share the most genetic similarities is the Verreaux&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Aquila verreauxii&quot;) of Africa. However, the Gurney&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Aquila gurneyi&quot;), a mostly allopatric but outwardly fairly similar eagle, is clearly a very close relation of the wedge-tailed eagle and the two are likely sister species, most probably originating from the same radiation across the Indo-Pacific region.

The wedge-tailed, Gurney&#x27;s and Verreaux&#x27;s eagles form a clade or a species complex with the well-known golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), the most widely distributed species in the entire accipitrid family, as well as outwardly dissimilar (smaller and paler-bellied yet also powerful) eagles like the Bonelli&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Aquila fasciata&quot;), the African hawk-eagle (&quot;Aquila spilogaster&quot;) and the Cassin&#x27;s hawk-eagle (&quot;Aquila africanus&quot;), the latter three having once been considered members of a different genus.

Beyond the aforementioned species, based on genetic testing, the four other &quot;Aquila&quot; species, although outwardly similar to golden and wedge-tailed eagles, being large, dark and brownish, with long wings, are thought to form a separate clade, and are paraphyletic from the members of what can be called the golden eagle clade. Other related outliers from outside the &quot;Aquila&quot; genus, are the small-to-mid-sized &quot;Clanga&quot; or spotted eagle species, and the widely found and quite small &quot;Hieraeetus&quot; eagles. One member of the latter genus contains the only other widely found Aquilinae eagle in Australia, the little eagle (&quot;Hieraaetus morphnoides&quot;).

===Subspecies===

Two subspecies of wedge-tailed eagle are recognised. However, the separation of the two subspecies has been called into question, largely because the reported differences in both size and coloration can be attributed to clinal variation, and some of the insular populations may still be at an intermediate stage of subspecific formation.
* &quot;A. a. audax&quot; (Latham, 1801) – This subspecies resides in the entire continent of Australia as well as in southern New Guinea. It is the typical wedge-tailed eagle as subsequently described.
* &quot;A. a. fleayi&quot; (Condon &amp; Amadon, 1954) – This race is endemic to Tasmania. The subspecies is named in honour of David Fleay, an Australian naturalist who was the first to propose the difference of the insular race. &quot;A. a. fleayi&quot; differs from mainland wedge-tailed eagles mainly via size and colouring. It is larger than the mainland eagle and is said to have particularly outsized talon dimensions compared to mainland eagles. Furthermore, it has a deep chocolate brown overall colour rather than blackish, with a whitish buff colouring to the nape rather than tawny-rufous feathers there. The juvenile is altogether paler and sandier than an equivalent-aged wedge-tailed eagle on mainland Australia.
: Although the validity of the subspecies has been questioned, genetic studies have determined that there is no gene flow or introgression between Tasmanian and other wedge-tailed eagles. Furthermore, the insular race was likely formed by marine dispersals, a process wedge-tailed eagles may continue to engage in despite usually avoiding large bodies of water, albeit usually in narrower straits.

==Description==


Wedge-tailed eagles are very large and quite lanky birds. They are characteristically black but can appear tar to charcoal brown, depending on lighting and individual variation. They have a massive bill but possess a relatively small and rather flat head, with a long, almost vulturine neck. Furthermore, they are distinctive for their prominent carpals and baggy feathered trousers. The species tends to perch conspicuously on dead trees, telegraph poles, rocks or, at times, the open ground. Between the bill size, elongated shape and prominent shoulders, the species is highly distinctive. While perched, their long wings extend down to a long and markedly wedge-tipped tail.

They have a large proportion of bare facial skin, which is thought to be an adaptation to the warm climate rather than carrion eating, because the non-carrion-eating Verreaux&#x27;s eagle has similar facial feathering and the golden eagle eats carrion too. Against the blackish plumage, the tawny-rufous hackles on the neck, forming a lanceolated shape, as well as the pale brown to rufous , and narrow mottled grey-brown band across the greater wing coverts, all stand out well. The sexes are indistinguishable by plumage.

The juvenile is mainly darkish brown, with extensive rufous feather edging, and a paler, fairly streaky head. Furthermore, the juvenile has a lighter-brown crissum, and a light reddish-brown to golden nape, with similar colouring extending sometimes to the back and wing band. The wing band is considerably more prominent than those of adults, extending to the median and sometimes the lesser coverts. Rarely, a juvenile may be all dull black, lacking rufous edges or a wing band. Young eagles are much the same by the second through to the fourth years though they may be almost invariably visibly in moult and with a narrowing wing band. They become darker around the fifth year, with a red-brown nape and a still narrowing wing band. Full mature plumage is not attained until the seventh or eighth year, although sexual maturity can be considered as early as five.

Adults have dark brown eyes, while juveniles usually have similar but slightly darker eyes. Wedge-tailed eagles are typically creamy white on the cere and feet, although those can be dull yellow, more so in juveniles than adults. The wedge-tailed eagle has a unique moult process in that they moult almost continuously and very slowly, and it might take three or more years for an eagle of the species to complete a moult. Moults are arrested only at times of famine, and happen gradually, so that they do not impede the bird&#x27;s flight or hunting capacities.

In flight, wedge-tailed eagles appear as a very large, dark raptor, with a protruding head, long and relatively narrow-looking wings, more or less parallel edged when soaring and, most distinctly, a long diamond-shaped tail. The shape is dissimilar to any other raptor in the world. Juveniles tend to be broader winged by comparison. The wingspan is around 2.2 times greater than the bird&#x27;s total length. They tend to fly with rather loose but deep and powerful beats. Wedge-tailed eagles spend much time sailing along, looking quite stable and controlled even in strong winds. The species glides and soars on upswept wings with long splayed primaries. The ample tail may be upcurved, or &quot;dished&quot;, at the edges. The eagle often spreads its deep wing emarginations to reduce drag in high winds. Contrary to their superlative and controlled appearance once on the wing, flight for wedge-tailed eagles can be a struggle even in normal circumstances, unless from it is from a pinnacle or it is somewhat windy and, within the forest, they may clamber about, with a &quot;lack of grace&quot;, to reach the canopy. Gorged birds on the ground can be vulnerable, being practically grounded, which was an advantage historically to Aboriginal hunters. Human gliders have encountered wedge-tailed eagles at more than .

The adult is all blackish on the wing but for the tawny-rufous nape and greyish wing band (running less than a quarter of the way down the wing&#x27;s width). Little relieves the dark coloration below but the pale brown to rufous crissum and the pale greyish bases to their flight feathers. Juvenile wedge-tailed eagles appear much browner although in general are not dissimilar in pattern below though the body and wings relative to adult. However, juveniles may show some paler mottling, of an off-rufous colour. Meanwhile, the juvenile&#x27;s tail and most flight feathers are barred greyish which in turn contrast against the pale based primaries with black tips. Above, the juvenile bears much paler and more sandy rufous colour from the head to at least upper mantle and along broad wing band (as well as more than half the wing width). The lighter dorsal colour sometimes extends to much of the back and scapulars. Rare individual juvenile eagles are dull black, without a wing band or paler edges. With much variation in individuals, generally as the young eagles age, the signature wing band shrinks incrementally and, after the fifth year, the plumage darkens.

===Size===
The female wedge-tailed eagle is one of the world&#x27;s largest eagles. Its nearest rival in Australia for size is some 15 per cent smaller linearly and 25 per cent lighter in weight. As is typical in birds of prey, the female is larger than the male. Although a few individual females are larger by only a small amount, they average up to 33 per cent larger. A full-grown female weighs between , while the smaller males weigh . Total length varies between and the wingspan typically is between . In 1930, the average weight and wingspans of 43 birds were and . The same average figures for a survey of 126 eagles in 1932 were and , respectively.

According to one guide, the mean body mass of male wedge-tailed eagles is while that of females is listed as , which, if accurate, is one of the most extreme examples of size sexual dimorphism known in any bird of prey. However, another sample showed far less stark size differences, with 29 males weighing an average of and 29 females an average of . In the same sample, from the Nullarbor Plain, males averaged wingspan of (sample of 26) and body length of (sample 5) while females had an average wingspan of (sample 23) and body length of . However, the Nullarbor Plain eagles appear slightly smaller than wedge-tailed eagle sizes from other surveys, based on body mass and wing chord sizes. An average length for males of and was described for wedge-tailed eagles in Queensland. Another source claimed an average male weight of and average female body mass of . Yet another book lists males as averaging and females as averaging . A sample of 10 males averaged while 19 females weighed . The mean body mass of males in Tasmania was while that for females was .

The largest wingspan ever verified for an eagle was for this species. A female killed in Tasmania in 1931 had a wingspan of , and another female measured barely smaller at . Similar claims, however, have been made for the Steller&#x27;s sea eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus pelagicus&quot;), which has been said to reach or exceed in wingspan. Reported claims of wedge-tailed eagles spanning and were unverified and deemed to be unreliable per Guinness World Records. This eagle&#x27;s great length and wingspan place it among the largest eagles in the world, but its wings, at more than , and tail, at up to , are unusually elongated for its body weight, and nine or ten other eagle species regularly outweigh it. It is around the third heaviest &quot;Aquila&quot; species, outsized only somewhat by the golden eagle and slightly by the Verreaux&#x27;s eagle, although it only slightly exceeds the weight of the Spanish imperial eagle (&quot;Aquila adalberti&quot;). Among the entire booted eagle subfamily, in addition to the two heavier &quot;Aquila&quot;, it is outsized in bulk by the martial eagle (&quot;Polemaetus bellicosus&quot;), while the also long-tailed crowned eagle (&quot;Stephanoaetus coronatus&quot;) can average of a roughly similar body mass to the wedge-tailed eagle, although the latter is marginally the heavier bird.

The wedge-tailed is exceeded in body mass by only a few eagles, especially the Steller&#x27;s sea eagle and harpy eagle (&quot;Harpia harpyja&quot;) and somewhat by the Philippine eagle (&quot;Pithecophaga jefferyi&quot;), the white-tailed eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus albicilla&quot;) and the bald eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;). However, it rivals the Steller&#x27;s and harpy eagles and is known to be exceeded only by the Philippine eagle in total length. The wedge-tailed eagle&#x27;s wingspan is the largest of any &quot;Aquila&quot;, and is exceeded amongst all eagles probably only by the white-tailed and Steller&#x27;s sea eagles in average spread though its average (not maximum) wingspan is rivaled by that of the martial eagle. Among standard measurements, within the nominate subspecies, the wing chord of males may range from while that of the female is from .


In Tasmania, the wing chord measured from in males and in females. In Nullarbor Plain, males averaged in wing chord while females averaged . Other Australian wedge-tailed eagles averaged in wing chord among males and among females. In Tasmania, the wing chord averaged in males and in females. The extreme tail length, slightly to greatly exceeding that of other &quot;Aquila&quot;, is in males from , averaging in the Nullarbor eagles and in Tasmania, and from , averaging in Nullarbor and in Tasmania. Although they only slightly exceed in tail length the heavier two &quot;Aquila&quot; and crowned eagles and they can rival the tail lengths of the Philippine and the Harpiinae eagles, Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles are quite likely to be the longest-tailed of all modern eagles.

The length of the tarsus may be from . The tarsus of 7 males averaged while that of 7 females averaged . In terms of bill measurements, the exposed culmen may range from in males and in females while total bill length (from the gape) is from and , in the sexes respectively. It is likely to be the largest billed &quot;Aquila&quot;, a bit ahead of the imperial eagles and the Verreaux&#x27;s eagle, behind only the larger &quot;Haliaeetus&quot; and Philippine eagles amongst all eagles. In Tasmania, culmen lengths averaged in males and in females while the total length of the bill averaged and .

The hallux claw, the enlarged rear talon on the hind toe, is slightly smaller than that of a golden or Verreaux&#x27;s eagle, even proportionately, but is extremely sharp. According to one study, wedge-tailed eagles had a hallux claw of , ranging from , in males , ranging from in a sample of 10, in females. Another source listed the hallux claw of mainland Australian eagles as averaging in males and in females. Meanwhile, in Tasmanian eagles, the hallux claw averaged , ranging from in males while in females, the hallux claw averaged , ranging from . In terms of osteological structure and size, the wedge-tailed eagle is said to be proportional to other eagles, being notably smaller and less robust than the heaviest eagles, such as Steller&#x27;s and harpies, but fairly similar in osteology, in both structure and proportions, to the golden eagle.

===Identification===
Their unique combination of large size, lanky build, long, diamond-shaped tail (though can be round-ended when both central feathers are moulted together), mainly black or rather dark plumage, and long wings seen when soaring or gliding make all ages of the wedge-tailed eagle fairly unmistakable in the majority of their range. The only main confusion species is often the black-breasted kite (&quot;Hamirostra melanosternon&quot;), which is surprisingly similar in colouring but is much smaller with a relatively short, squared tail and extensive clear white windows covering a good part of their wings. Juveniles of the white-bellied sea eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucogaster&quot;), at times mentioned as potentially confusable with a young wedge-tailed eagle, are much paler below with a rather different flight pattern: a short pale tail, bare legs, shorter, broader wings held in stiff dihedral.

In New Guinea, the Gurney&#x27;s eagle is more similar than those species in form and build but the Gurney&#x27;s is somewhat smaller and more compact than the wedge-tailed eagle with rich yellow feet, a rather shorter rounded or faintly wedge-tipped tail, shorter and relatively broader wings (in adaptation to more forest-living). Furthermore, the Gurney&#x27;s eagle has a much paler immature plumage. Although usually considered an island endemic, the Gurney&#x27;s eagle is possibly capable of marine dispersals, as is the wedge-tailed eagle, that may lead to them to turn up in the forests of northern Australia and historical reports show that a rare vagrant of the species may indeed appear there. The Papuan eagle (&quot;Harpyopsis novaeguineae&quot;), the only other island raptor in New Guinea that approaches the wedge-tailed in size, is a highly distinct and forest-restricted species, being much paler, particularly below, with long, bare legs and different proportions, more like a giant &quot;Accipiter&quot; with short rounded wings, a long, somewhat rounded tipped tail, and a large, rounded head.

===Vocalizations===
Wedge-tailed eagles are not well known for its vocalization nor are they often heard. They may be silent for long stretches of time, possibly months, at least outside of breeding season. When vocalizations have been documented, it usually only near the nest and in aerial display, and can be hard to hear unless at close range. The commonest calls for wedge-tailed eagles are high, rather thin whistles, sometimes transcribed as &quot;I-see, I-see&quot; followed by a short descending &quot;see-tya&quot;. Also documented during the breeding season are various other whistles, yelps and squeals and an often rolling series. Characteristically, all their calls are surprisingly weak, though the main call is sometimes considered to have a &quot;melancholy&quot; quality. The opinion on their call is not dissimilar to the golden eagle, whose voice is similarly considered unimpressive. Female calls in wedge-tailed eagles are similar but are generally lower and harsher than males.

==Range and habitat==
Wedge-tailed eagles are found throughout Australia (including Tasmania), as well as southern New Guinea, in almost all habitats, though they tend to be more common in favourable habitat in southern and eastern Australia. In Australia, they may be found almost all the way from the Cape York Peninsula in the north down to Wilsons Promontory National Park and Great Otway National Parks in the southern tips of the continent, and from Shark Bay in the western side of the continent to Great Sandy National Park and Byron Bay in the east. They are widespread throughout the desert interior of Australia, but are rare in low densities in the most arid parts of the continent, such as the Lake Eyre Basin. Offshore, the wedge-tailed eagle may be distributed in several of the larger Australian islands and some of the smaller ones. Those include a majority of the Torres Strait Islands, Albany Island, Pipon Island, the isles of Bathurst Bay, many small isles in Queensland, from Night Island down to the South Cumberland Islands, Fraser Island, Moreton Island, North Stradbroke Island, Montague Island, Kangaroo Island, the Nuyts Archipelago, Groote Eylandt and the Tiwi Islands. In Tasmania, they may be found essentially throughout as well as some isles of the Kent Group, Bass Strait, Flinders Island and Cape Barren Island. In New Guinea, the wedge-tailed eagle is highly range restricted and can be found predominantly in the Trans-Fly savanna and grasslands and the general area around the Western Province, as well as in Indonesia Merauke Regency, with some isolated reports in Western New Guinea, the Bensbach River and the Oriomo River.

===Habitat===
The wedge-tailed eagle lives in an extremely wide range of habitats. Although range is restricted relative to the golden eagle, it likely occupies a wider range of habitat types than likely any other &quot;Aquila&quot; eagle, and may outrival any booted eagle species in their use of diverse habitats, being somewhat more akin to habitat generalist raptors such as &quot;Buteo&quot; buzzards. Assorted habitats known to host wedge-tailed eagles includes open woodland, savanna, heathland, grasslands, desert edge and semi-desert, subalpine forests, montane grasslands and mountain peaks, not-too-dense tropical rainforests, monsoon forests, dwarf conifer forests, some wetlands as well as regularly forays to coastal areas, though normally along the coasts they occur around plains somewhat away from the water. Favored habitat tends to be remote or rough country, at least partially wooded and not uncommonly varied with some rocky spots as well as in shrubland. Wedge-tailed eagles seem to prefer some dead trees to be present. They may occur around &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; woodland quite regularly, as well as &quot;Acacia&quot; woodland and mixed woodlands of &quot;Casuarina cristata-Flindersia maculosa-Callitris&quot; cypresses and also stands of &quot;Casuarina cunninghamiana&quot;. A strong preference was detected for &quot;C. cunninghamiana&quot; alternatively with several &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species was detected in the Australian Capital Territory, sloping ground allowing good access and access to tall, mature trees being paramount to the eagles in the study. Quite often they will be seen soaring over hills, mountains or escarpments as well as over flat plains, especially spinex grassland. Dense forest is typically avoided with glades and edge often sought out in forested areas. While they do occur in rich riparian woodlands, it is with relative scarcity despite this being where many other raptors of the nation concentrate. In the deserts of the Lake Eyre basin, they are often seen in gibber plains along treed watercourses and drainage basins, here often concentrated around &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; in stony creek beds. In the sandy desert areas of Western Australia, wedge-tailed eagles were once reasonably common but have largely vacated the region after the macropod prey they live off of there were all but hunted to extinction. Wedge-tailed eagles commonly occur from sea level up to about with seemingly no preference based on altitudinal level. A fairly pronounced liking for mountainous localities such as plateaus has been detected in a few studies of wedge-tailed eagle. One of the few habitat types considered to be strongly avoided by wedge-tailed eagles are areas intensively settled or cultivated areas. A slightly fading tendency to avoid human areas has been detected, perhaps as persecution rates have gone far down, and the wedge-tailed eagle may be seen near towns and villages in exurban and even suburban areas largely within bushland. However, the species is seldom seen other than as a flyover in more developed towns and cities. Additionally, it is not uncommon to see these eagles in man-made spots such as pasture areas, forestry clearings, and rolling farmland areas.

==Behaviour==

This impressive bird of prey spends much of the day perching in trees, on rocks as well as similar exposed lookout sites such as cliffs from which it has a good view of its surroundings. Alternatively, they may sit on the ground for long periods of time or watch from a lower point, such as on termite mounds or anthills. Now and then, it takes off from its perch to fly low over its territory. Especially whilst not breeding, wedge-tailed eagles spends a considerable amount of the day on the wing. Wedge-tailed eagles are highly aerial, soaring for hours on end without wingbeat and seemingly without effort, regularly reaching and sometimes considerably higher. The purpose of soaring has received little specific study in wedge-tailed eagles, but it is likely, as in other accipitrids, in large part for surveying the territory and advertising their presence to other eagles. During the intense heat of the middle part of the day, it often soars high in the air, circling up on the thermal currents that rise from the ground below. Often when on the wing, it is scarcely visible to the human&#x27;s naked eye. Their keen eyesight extends into ultraviolet bands. With a visual perception some three times more acute than those of humans, one of the largest pecten oculi of any bird and an eye roughly as big as a small human&#x27;s, they may be one of the most sharp-eyed birds in the world.

The wedge-tailed eagle is largely sedentary as expected of a raptor dwelling in the subtropics, although they also dwell in the tropics (far northern Australia and New Guinea) as well as in the temperate zone (Tasmania). However, juveniles of the species can be quite dispersive. In some cases, they have moved to a recorded distance of some . These extreme movements have been completed within 7 to 8 months after dispersal. More typically they move no farther than or so. The adult eagles can also be nomadic, though only in circumstances such as drought conditions. In turn this explains the species presence in places they don&#x27;t breed, even adults. In addition to moving for drought in arid zone, also moves in highest part of New South Wales, e.g. the Snowy Mountains, the species often apparently vacates snow-covered alpine zone in winter. The small New Guinea population is apparently indistinguishable from the mainland race and so possibly result of recent colonization, although no records exist of migrating wedge-tailed eagles islands past the Torres Straits. However, it can be projected from its presence in various offshore islands its capacity for crossing straits ranging up to as far as apart. One post dispersal young eagle was observed to distribute from Kangaroo Island to the mainland, possibly a regular occurrence. Due to their tendency for wandering, some authors class the wedge-tailed eagles as a &quot;partial or irruptive migrant&quot;. However, while they are arguably irruptive, it does not fit the mould of a true migrant well since under normal circumstances adults are rather sedentary unless environmental changes force them to move.

The wedge-tailed eagle is the only bird that has a reputation for not infrequently attacking hang gliders and paragliders, although other eagles including the golden eagle have also been recorded to behave thusly. Based on the response the eagles show to the gliders, they presumably are defending their territory and treating the perceived intruder like another eagle. Cases are recorded of the birds damaging the fabric of these gliders with their talons as well as some other parts of the gliding apparatus, but not the humans themselves, has been reported. They have also been reported to attack and destroy unmanned aerial vehicles used for mining survey operations in Australia.

The presence of a wedge-tailed eagle often causes panic among smaller birds and, as a result, aggressive species such as magpies (one of the most vulnerable types of passerine to eagle attacks), butcherbirds, wagtails, monarch flycatchers, lapwings, and miners as well as smaller birds of prey, including both accipitrids and falcons, any of which may aggressively mob eagles (see video). Multiple species may join the kerfuffle and mob them, especially while the eagles perched, often engaging in noisy calling, presumably meant to disorient the predator, and occasionally in physical attacks against the eagle, typically focused where the big, relatively lumbering eagles could not grasp the attacking birds. The wedge-tailed eagle usually does not engage its tormentors but sometimes rolls in the air to present talons whether perched or not. Sometimes wedge-tailed eagles appear to fight but this and other behaviours, especially between young eagles, may be interpreted as playful. Some such behaviours have included fetching sticks tossed by others, athletic flipping between juvenile eagles and even playing games with dogs, via floating above them until the dogs bark or leap then floating up until the dog settles and then repeating the &quot;game&quot;.

Flocking behaviour has been noted, similar to that of vultures (Cathartidae and Accipitridae) in other countries, when carrion is available.

==Dietary biology==
The wedge-tailed eagle is one of the world&#x27;s most powerful avian predators. Due to its formidable and dominating nature, it is sometimes nicknamed &quot;King of Birds&quot;, along with golden eagles. Prey is usually grabbed via a pounce or snatch during a gliding flight or a tail-chase from low quartering or transect flights. Prey is not infrequently spotted from a soaring flight and they may undertake a long, slanting stoop towards it. They may be able to spot prey from farther than a kilometre given their keen vision. Its typical hunting style is not all-together dissimilar from that of golden or Verreaux&#x27;s eagles. Occasionally, a wedge-tailed eagle still hunts from a perch. Unsuccessful hunts typically exceed in number successful ones.

Hunting habitat can be highly variably and can manage to capture prey in both open country and quite thick woodland or forest, though typically require an open understory in the latter. Almost all its prey is taken on the ground but to a lesser extent it may be taken from the tree canopy. They&#x27;ve been known to take birds such as currawongs and cockatoos by coming around them by surprise around a tree or by darting out in flight at close range for a brief tail-chase. Sometimes, an eagle may pull brushtail possums and other mammals from tree cavities, as well as young birds from a nest. They&#x27;ve been known to follow wildfires to search for fleeing animals or alternately tractors and other farm equipment for the same purpose. Wedge-tailed eagles occasionally pirate food from other predators. An eagle of the species can carry prey of at least .

Large animals may be attacked by pairs or, occasionally, by groups acting cooperatively. One record shows 15 wedge-tailed eagles hunting kangaroos, two actively chasing at a time, then repeatedly being replaced by two more from the circling group overhead. Regardless of prey size and season, tandem hunts, mainly by breeding adult pairs or sometimes loosely associated young eagles, are not uncommon. Of 89 observed hunts in Central Australia around one-third were cooperative ones. As in other tandem hunting raptors, one eagle typically lies in wait generally unseen while the other eagle distracts and drives the prey towards it. When hunting domesticated prey, they&#x27;ve been seen to land near livestock mothers to intimidate them and separate their young, so they can attack the latter. Sometimes, wedge-tailed eagles may use fences to limit a prey&#x27;s escape routes. In some cases, these eagles will attempt to force large prey such as kangaroos and dingos to fall off steep hillsides and injure themselves.

At times, wedge-tailed eagles appear to hunt at earliest light or late twilight in order to come upon nocturnal prey such as hare-wallaby and bettongs. These eagles have been seen removing rabbits from traps and eating carrion in bright moonlight as well. At times, remarkably, wedge-tailed eagles have been covering large prey with vegetation, apparently to cache food too heavy to carry. Carrion is a major diet item, also; wedge-tails can spot the activity of ravens around a carcass from a great distance, and glide down to appropriate it. Carrion consumption is recorded in all season and contexts, although generally non-breeding birds are more likely to scavenge and young wedge-tailed eagles, even more so shortly post-dispersal, are thought to be far more likely to scavenge on carrion than adults generally. Wedge-tailed eagles are often seen by the roadside in rural Australia, feeding on animals that have been killed in collisions with vehicles. The importance of carrion relative to live prey has not been greatly studied but away from human development, especially roads, carrion is less likely to be encountered and eagles of all ages must presumably hunt to survive. In general, Australian accipitrids of many species not infrequently come to carrion and they along with large passerines like &quot;Corvus&quot; species and currawongs probably fulfill the niche that vultures do in other continents to some extent, albeit with considerably less specialization.

Aggregations of wedge-tailed eagles may occur not infrequently at large carcasses, with up to 5–12 eagles or sometimes 20 gathering. A wedge-tailed eagle can gorge up to at a sitting and, when fulfilled, can lasts for an unusual amount of time, for up to weeks or even a month, before needing to hunt again, apparently due to the warmth of the environment. After feeding they may disgorge a relatively small pellet, long by wide and weighing some . Usually the diet is determined from a combination of reviewing these pellets along with loose prey remains.

===Prey spectrum===
The wedge-tailed eagle is a dietary generalist, opportunistically capturing a wide range of prey species. Its prey spectrum is quite broad, with well over 200 prey species documented to be taken and even this includes very few prey only from secondary accounts from Tasmania and New Guinea. The wedge-tailed eagles tends to prefer smallish to fairly large mammals as prey. However, they not infrequently take ample numbers of both birds and reptiles, along with scarcely other prey taxon. Out of 21 accrued dietary studies, 61.3% of prey items by number in the foods during nesting efforts were mammals, 21.6% were birds, 13.2% were reptiles, 2.1% by invertebrates, principally insects, 1.5% by fish, and almost no amphibians by number. Meanwhile, out of the 21, 13 studies calculated estimated biomass, and found that just shy of 90% of prey biomass was made of by mammals, 6.2% by birds and 3.4% by reptiles. Out of the &quot;Aquila&quot; genus, it is one of a few generalist species, however the wedge-tailed eagle is the &quot;Aquila&quot; most likely to typically attack the largest prey. Generally, this species prefers to attack birds and reptiles weighing over and mammals weighing over , although prey taken at times has varied from a few grams to more than sixteen times the weight of an individual eagle.

A comparison estimate posited that around 2% of wedge-tailed eagle prey weighs less than , 4% of their prey weighs , 7% of their prey weighs , 10% weighs , 20% weighs , 25% weighs , 18% weighs and 14% weighs over . Projected from this comparison, the mean prey size for wedge-tailed eagles is estimated at , similar but just slightly ahead of the Verreaux&#x27;s eagle and some 14% ahead of the golden eagle global mean prey size. Further studies estimated mean prey weight, showing the mean prey weigh in the Canberra-Australian Capital Territory region in three different studies was estimated to be , and , changing likely due to the shifting significances of leporids and larger macropods. In a small study from Armidale, New South Wales, it was estimated that mean prey weight was . It only ranks behind the crowned eagle and harpy eagle and rivals the martial eagle as the eagle likely to attack the largest prey on average.

====Mammals====
=====Introduced mammals=====
While the introduction of invasive species to Australia has been generally having a negative to devastating effect on native animals and ecosystems, the wedge-tailed eagle is one of a few native species to largely benefit from these introductions. This is especially due to the introduction of the European rabbit, which were deliberately introduced repeatedly (abortively in 1859 and then via a concerted effect from 1937 to 1950), largely so the wealthy could hunt them. The wedge-tailed eagles quickly took to the rabbits as prey along with another introduced leporid, the European hare (&quot;Lepus europaeus&quot;). In almost every part of Australia, these eagles take rabbits in some numbers and they usually constitute the bulk of the prey species in most, if not all, Australian food studies. In some dietary studies rabbits have accounted for up to 89.2% of the diet by number and 86% by biomass, as in Bacchus Marsh, however they more typically range from 16% to 49% of the diet by number in various studies. One Canberra study found that 98.5% of the rabbits taken were adults. In the largest study near Canberra, over 5.5 years, 19.3% of the diet of wedge-tailed eagles was rabbits (12.7% of prey biomass) among 1421 prey items, so the eagles took a total of some 275 rabbits in the 11 to 17 studied territories of the area. A study estimated that mean weight of wild rabbits in Australia was , lower than estimated in the past. However, other studies estimated the mean weights of rabbits taken by wedge-tailed eagles as variously from or &quot;usually over &quot;, infrequently reported to , size of the rabbits being perhaps limited the poorly-suited soil and environs of the Australian wilderness. Meanwhile, the European hare is neither as widely established nor as prolifically taken as rabbits by wedge-tailed eagles but are by no means neglected and a substantial meal. With a mean body mass of , hares have been as much as nearly 10% of the local diet and up to 14% of prey biomass in studies. Rabbit haemorrhagic disease was deliberately introduced to control the population of rabbits subsequent to 1995, followed more effectively by introduction of myxoma virus to limit the damage rabbits have inflicted on native vegetation and resultingly have competed native mammals like wallabies out of parts of their range. Ultimately, the rabbit population may have more than halved and locally have been some 90% reduced. As a matter of consensus, the wedge-tailed eagles do not appear to be adversely affected in major ways by the biological control of rabbits since they can revert to primarily taking native prey species quite readily. In the region of Broken Hill, White Cliffs and Cunnamulla, rabbits have gone down from accounting for 56–69% of the diet to 16–31% of it. Furthermore, wedge-tailed eagles have been known to successfully maintain population in the absence of any rabbits in a few areas.

Much more controversial at one time than hunting introduced rabbits and hares is the wedge-tailed eagle&#x27;s occasional tendency to feed on and sometimes kill domesticated livestock animals. The predation of wedge-tailed eagles on young farm animals has been the primary historic driver for the persecution of the species. However, in no known study have domestic livestock been known to be primary prey. The closest association with them was in northwestern Queensland where lambs (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;) made up 32.7% of prey in pellets and 17.1% in remains, accounting for 15–21% of the prey biomass, while juvenile pigs (&quot;Sus scrofa domesticus&quot;) made up 7.3% of pellet remains and 22% of the biomass. Although it can be highly difficult, attempts have been made at parsing out whether the eagles had indeed killed the lambs rather than just lifting or dismantling them after finding them dead, as this eagle quite readily comes to carrion. The findings were that of 29 diagnosable lamb deaths in northwest Queensland, only 34.5% were due to eagle attacks. The wedge-tailed eagle is at times capable of taking very substantial livestock animals, lambs taken have been estimated to weigh a mean of or up to while fully grown sheep weighing some are infrequently vulnerable, presumably in large part to hunting pairs of eagles. In the largest study of the Canberra area, 82.5% of diagnosable sheep specimens were adults but probably were by and large scavenged. Meanwhile, young pigs included in the diet were estimated to weigh around , and sometimes feral piglets are included in the diet. When attacking lambs, the wedge-tailed eagles are apparently capable of driving their talons into the skull of the victim, although more typically they land along the back and grip the lamb along the spine until it weakens and collapses while flapping the wings for balance. This species will also land between a ewe or female pig and their respective lambs or piglets in order to separate the latter for attack. Wedge-tailed eagles are also known to at times prey on another animal introduced for human hunting purposes, the red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), which can form up to about 4% of an eagle&#x27;s breeding diet and 5% of the biomass, weighing up to . In Canberra, about 59% of the foxes found in the diet were adults. Additionally, feral cats, mainly juveniles, can be part of their prey.

=====Native mammals=====
Presumably, the primary native prey of wedge-tailed eagles is marsupials, particularly macropods, which is also in accord with studies involving places where rabbits have declined or never occurred. Many wallabies, kangaroos, and associated animals are included in the diet, with over 50 marsupials known to be in the species’ prey spectrum. When selecting marsupials, wedge-tailed eagles tend to ignore smaller species and focus on larger-sized ones. However, they generally most often take alive the young, small and sickly of large macropod marsupials. Findings were that juvenile macropods were taken out of proportion to their numbers in the environment, unlike rabbits which were taken roughly in proportion to their abundance.

In recent times, they have been known to eat marsupials, such as kangaroos killed by cars. There is little evidence that macropods delivered to nests are usually roadkills or from carrion, but the source of prey is difficult to determine because, to minimize disturbance, examinations are usually done after breeding is complete. As well, the attendance at carrion by wedge-tailed eagles is disproportionately done by juvenile eagles. In one study of roadkills in Australia, the species ranked around fourth in frequency and capacity for carcass breakdown of scavengers at roadkills, behind feral pigs, red foxes, and ravens.

A video surveillance study at the nest determined that seemingly freshly killed, albeit usually quite young macropods were delivered to nests near Broken Hill. As much as 20% to 30% of the diet can be made up of by macropods. Large and prominent species are known including the grey kangaroos and the red kangaroo (&quot;Osphranter rufus&quot;). Generally, juveniles are targeted of these large species with eastern grey kangaroos (&quot;Macropus giganteus&quot;) estimated to weigh when taken by wedge-tailed eagles, in Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales, while the weight of young western grey kangaroos (&quot;Macropus fuliginosus&quot;) was said to be in one study in Western Australia. The estimated weight of juvenile red kangaroos taken was in northwestern Queensland where they were the primary prey species ahead of lambs. However, wedge-tailed eagles do not shy away from attacking large, adult macropods. Similarly large adult macropods killed by these eagles can include common wallaroos (&quot;Osphranter robustus&quot;) (mean adult weight around ), antilopine kangaroo (&quot;Osphranter antilopinus&quot;) (mean adult weight around ), agile wallaby (&quot;Notamacropus agilis&quot;) (median adult weight around ), black-striped wallaby (&quot;Notamacropus dorsalis&quot;) (median adult weight around ), red-necked wallaby (&quot;Notamacropus rufogriseus&quot;) estimated to weigh around when taken, swamp wallaby (&quot;Wallabia bicolor&quot;) (mean adult weight around ), and even red kangaroo adults. They&#x27;ve been recorded attacking eastern grey kangaroos weighing over . In extreme cases, wedge-tailed eagles have killed kangaroos weighing approximately . In one case, a huge male eastern grey kangaroo, estimated to stand was successfully dispatched by a pair of wedge-tailed eagles. Furthermore, an adult female western grey kangaroo was witnessed to be killed &quot;in a few minutes&quot; by a hunting pair of wedge-tailed eagles, and the eagles are considered a serious predator of the western grey. In some unusual cases, wedge-tailed eagle hunting parties can form whilst hunting red kangaroos, sometimes including up to 15 eagles (more loose, opportunistic aggregations than well-organized groups), but usually only a pair is sufficient to kill such prey. Normally, the eagles repeatedly attack the kangaroo, sinking their talons into the back or nape and then fly up, when the second eagle starts doing the same. In some cases, as many as 123 attacks have been carried out against large kangaroos before they succumb. When attacking joeys, eagles may, in some cases, have intentionally caused a mother kangaroo to dislodge a joey from the pouch to capture and fly off with it.

In addition, several smaller and more elusive macropods are taken including tree-kangaroos, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies, rock-wallabies, dorcopsises and pademelons. Other marsupials are by no means neglected. In Shark Bay, hare-wallabies and bettongs seem to form the central part of the diet. Another dietary favourite is the common brushtail possum (&quot;Trichosurus vulpecula&quot;), weighing some , which was important supplemental prey in the Perth area and was the primary prey species on Kangaroo Island, at 33% of the diet there. Around Perth, other small, nocturnal marsupials were taken in some numbers including woylies (&quot;Bettongia penicillata&quot;) and southern brown bandicoots (&quot;Isoodon obesulus&quot;). The common ringtail possum (&quot;Pseudocheirus peregrinus&quot;) was the second most prominent prey species in the diet near Melbourne, comprising 20.1% of the diet, with some numbers of common brushtails also taken there. Long-nosed bandicoots (&quot;Perameles nasuta&quot;) were regular supplemental prey in northeastern New South Wales. Other notable marsupials known to fall prey to wedge-tailed eagles include adults of the following: koalas (&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus&quot;), quokkas (&quot;Setonix brachyurus&quot;), eastern (&quot;Dasyurus viverrinus&quot;), western (&quot;Dasyurus geoffroii&quot;) and tiger quolls (&quot;Dasyurus maculatus&quot;), Tasmanian devils (&quot;Sarcophilus harrisii&quot;), bilbies, numbats (&quot;Myrmecobius fasciatus&quot;), common wombats (&quot;Vombatus ursinus&quot;), southern greater gliders (&quot;Petauroides volans&quot;) and potoroos.

With relative infrequency, other classes of mammals, beyond leporids and marsupials, may be taken opportunistically by wedge-tailed eagles. At least two species each of flying foxes and wattled bats are included in the prey spectrum. Occasionally, an eagle may take a monotreme including both the platypus (&quot;Ornithorhynchus anatinus&quot;) and the short-beaked echidna (&quot;Tachyglossus aculeatus&quot;). Several species of rat are readily taken and even the house mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;), likely the smallest mammalian prey known for wedge-tailed eagles at around in weight. Although rare, a dingo (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;) may be taken by a wedge-tailed eagle at times, mostly pups, or carrion but sometimes a pair of eagles can kill adults too. Beyond sheep, pigs, and infrequently young goats (&quot;Capra hircus&quot;), other ungulate prey, entirely introduced by man into the Australasian region, is eaten exclusively as carrion so far as is known, including cattle (&quot;Bos taurus&quot; - despite claims that eagles have killed young calves, which is possible, they have only ever been witnessed feeding on afterbirths and not harming calves), Javan rusa (&quot;Rusa timorensis&quot;) in New Guinea, sambar deer (&quot;Rusa unicolor&quot;) in northern Victoria and water buffalo (&quot;Bubalus bubalis&quot;) in the Northern Territory. In one instance, a young girl was apparently subject to a brief attack by a wedge-tailed eagle, in what was likely an attempted act of predation, near her rural home but the attack was abandoned by the eagle. It has been noted that some different species of large eagles are thought to occasionally attack children as prey though, among extant species, only the crowned eagle and martial eagle, both in Africa, are thought to have successfully carried out rare acts of predation on human children.

====Birds====

Birds take a clearly secondary position to mammals when importance and especially prey weight are concerned; however, the wedge-tailed eagle shows some fondness for avian prey. With more than 100 prey species included in the prey spectrum, birds are the most diverse class of prey taken by these eagles. Generally, the predation of birds seems to be highly opportunistic and no one type of bird reliably dominates the eagle&#x27;s diet. However certain species, probably due to their commonality in eagle territories and perhaps vulnerability through their own behaviour that seem to be taken most often. These consist of &quot;Corvus&quot; species, especially little (&quot;Corvus mellori&quot;) and Australian ravens (&quot;Corvus coronoides&quot;), weighing a mean between species of around when taken, Australian magpies (&quot;Gymnorhina tibicen&quot;), Australian wood duck (&quot;Chenonetta jubata&quot;), galah (&quot;Eolophus roseicapilla&quot;), larger cockatoos and smaller parakeets and parrots. On Kangaroo Island, Australian and little ravens together constituted 19% of the diet. In Canberra, fairly prominent numbers of magpies, wood ducks, galahs and eastern (&quot;Platycercus eximius&quot;) and crimson rosellas (&quot;Platycercus elegans&quot;) are known to be taken, these collectively forming up to about 25% of the diet by number. In the Perth region, birds were taken amply, especially the Australian raven at 12.6% of prey remains and 4.7% of the biomass, with birds constituting just shy of 25% of the diet. Elsewhere in Western Australia, a similar percentage of the diet is made up of by birds, mostly the same species with some number of Australian ringnecks (&quot;Barnardius zonarius&quot;) and Baudin&#x27;s black cockatoos (&quot;Zanda baudinii&quot;) as well. Peculiarly, one study found that among a large sample of 1826 prey items in the Northern Territory that the most often identified prey species was the tiny budgerigar (&quot;Melopsittacus undulatus&quot;), at one of the smallest avian prey species for this eagle. In a single study from the Fleurieu Peninsula, birds were the majority of prey for wedge-tailed eagles, at 62.5%, mostly &quot;Corvus&quot; followed by wood duck, galah and magpies. Other assorted avian prey include several species of waterfowl, including several ducks as well as swans and geese, and a fairly strong frequency of attacks on large rails, such as swamphens, moorhens, native-hens and coots.

Additionally, wedge-tailed eagles may take Australian brush turkeys (&quot;Alectura lathami&quot;) and malleefowl (&quot;Leipoa ocellata&quot;), quail, pigeons and doves, frogmouths and owlet-nightjars, cuckoos, buttonquails, stilts, lapwings, plains-wanderers (&quot;Pedionomus torquatus&quot;), thick-knees, gulls, petrels, cormorants, herons, ibises and spoonbills, cranes, other birds of prey, kingfishers, honeyeaters, quail-thrushes, whistlers, monarch flycatchers, mudnesters, artamids, true thrushes, grass warblers, starlings and pipits. The smallest avian prey attributed to wedge-tailed eagles is the zebra finch (&quot;Taeniopygia guttata&quot;). Particularly large birds are sometimes taken of a few species. When it comes to the emu (&quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae&quot;), Australia&#x27;s tallest and second heaviest bird, wedge-tailed eagles normally attack the small young but are capable of attacking adult emus more than 10 times their own weight. Two estimates estimated the typical body mass of emus attacked were merely , respectively, against an average of for adult emu. As much as 4% of the diet of wedge-tailed eagles can consist of emu chicks. Some of Australia&#x27;s largest flying birds are also included in the wedge-tailed eagle&#x27;s prey spectrum. These include the black swan (&quot;Cygnus atratus&quot;), estimated to weigh when taken, black-necked stork (&quot;Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus&quot;), which weighs at least , and brolga (&quot;Antigone rubicunda&quot;), arguably Australia&#x27;s largest resident flying species of bird at a mean of . An unusually close feeding association with a very large bird is with the Australian bustard (&quot;Ardeotis australis&quot;) in northwestern Queensland, where bustards were found to account for 13.4% of the pellet contents and 23% of prey biomass. That study calculated the mean weight of bustards taken as , indicating that the eagles were selectively predating the much larger male bustards.

====Reptiles and other prey====
When selecting reptiles as prey, wedge-tailed eagles by far are most likely to pursue lizards. The range of lizards they may prey upon is highly diverse in size and nature, with somewhere between 20 and 30 species known in the prey spectrum. The most preferred reptilian prey by far is bearded dragons. Despite the small size of this prey relative to most mammalian prey, they can be key to survivorship in more arid vicinities such as central and western Australia where there is less diverse prey to pick from. In video monitored prey deliveries at Fowlers Gap Arid Zone Research Station, central bearded dragons (&quot;Pogona vitticeps&quot;) dominated the prey composition, making up 68.2% of 110 prey deliveries and the only known instance of reptiles forming the bulk of wedge-tailed eagle diet. A different study from prey remains and pellets found the central bearded dragon to comprise 28.6% of the diet among 192 prey items. In south-central Queensland, the bearded dragon was the leading prey species by number, making up 26.9% of 729 prey items. In northeastern New South Wales, the eastern bearded dragon (&quot;Pogona barbata&quot;) was the second most numerous prey species behind the rabbit, at 16.6% of the diet. The bearded dragons when taken by wedge-tailed eagles have had an estimated body mass ranging from . They also prey on jacky dragons. Larger lizards are readily taken as well given the opportunity. Skinks are occasional supplemental prey, common blue-tongued skink (&quot;Tiliqua scincoides&quot;) at around can make up around 5% of the diet (in northeast New South Wales), while the Centralian blue-tongued skink (&quot;Tiliqua multifasciata&quot;) was quite prominent in the diet in the Northern Territory. In Western Australia, shingleback skink (&quot;Tiliqua rugosa&quot;) and somewhat smaller western blue-tongued skink (&quot;Tiliqua occipitalis&quot;) collectively comprised about 7.5% of the diet. Much bigger lizards are sometimes taken, namely monitor lizards. Around 20% of the 231 prey items of in a Western Australian study was found to be monitor lizards, mostly yellow-spotted monitors (&quot;Varanus panoptes&quot;) with some sand goannas (&quot;Varanus gouldii&quot;). Adult Rosenberg&#x27;s monitors (&quot;Varanus rosenbergi&quot;), weighing around can be also taken. Even lace monitors (&quot;Varanus varius&quot;), which weighs on average adults, can be a prey for this powerful eagle. Contrarily, lizards down to the size of a pygmy spiny-tailed skink (&quot;Egernia depressa&quot;) and a thorny devil (&quot;Moloch horridus&quot;) may be taken.

Beyond lizards, wedge-tailed eagles seldom seem to hunt other types of reptiles. They hunt a few species of snakes, mostly venomous species, because they are prevalent in Australia. Snakes known to be included in the diet including tiger snakes (&quot;Notechis scutatus&quot;), eastern brown snake (&quot;Pseudonaja textilis&quot;), ringed brown snake (&quot;Pseudonaja modesta&quot;), bandy-bandy (&quot;Vermicella annulata&quot;), yellow-faced whipsnake (&quot;Demansia psammophis&quot;), red-bellied black snake (&quot;Pseudechis porphyriacus&quot;) and brown tree snake (&quot;Boiga irregularis&quot;). Eastern long-necked turtle (&quot;Chelodina longicollis&quot;) have been claimed as prey in one report although any other confirmed cases of predation on turtles by this species are not known. Notably, there are no reports of wedge-tailed eagles attacking pythons, despite several species being present in Australia, nor on crocodiles; perhaps these are the only predators too formidable to be attacked, as both of these reptiles can attain extremely large sizes. Predation on frogs or other amphibians is almost unheard of for wedge-tailed eagles, however, based on toxicity reports in eagles, they may consume invasive cane toads (&quot;Rhinella marina&quot;) from time to time. Similarly rare in the species’ diet is fish, although common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;) and western blue groper (&quot;Achoerodus gouldii&quot;) have been documented as prey. Occasionally, wedge-tailed eagles may even attack insects such as &quot;Psaltoda moerens&quot; cicadas and &quot;Heteronychus arator&quot; beetles. Truly exceptional is in the Northern Territory, where a large percentage of 1826 prey items was made up of by insects including unidentified Orthoptera, at about 10.8% of the diet, unidentified beetles, at about 8.4%, as well as some numbers of ants. Why and how they capture a profusion of insects locally is not clear, and they may be often from the stomachs of other prey or even byproduct from the captures of other prey or from the bodies of carcasses.

===Interspecific predatory relationships===
The wedge-tailed eagle occupies a fairly unique niche relative to other &quot;Aquila&quot;. While primarily continental in distribution, it is distributed well apart from most related species, whereas most &quot;Aquila&quot; are distributed in Eurasia or Africa and face considerable competition over resources, enabling certain specializations of most species in habitat or microhabitat, morphology and behaviours and often life history, including nesting grounds and often foods. The wedge-tailed eagle has the ability to exploit a more catholic variation of both prey and habitat since it exists with relatively fewer competing species. The most considerable potential competition comes in the two other eagles regularly distributed in Australia, the little eagle and white-bellied sea eagle. The little eagle has a few ecological similarities to the wedge-tailed eagle. It is also something of a habitat generalist, although it is found somewhat scarcely in more arid vicinity, high elevation areas and varied semi-open forest than the wedge-tailed eagle. Like the wedge-tailed eagle, the little eagle has in recent decades become a somewhat specialized predator of European rabbits. However, the size difference is extreme between the wedge-tailed and little eagles, with the earlier over four times heavier than the latter, and the little eagle as expected exploits a lower trophic level relative to its more powerful competitor. As in other areas where booted eagles and sea eagles have abutting ranges, sometimes wedge-tailed eagles compete with white-bellied sea eagles. One key difference from elsewhere where competition sometimes occurs such as the golden eagle with the white-tailed eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus albicilla&quot;) in Eurasia and the bald eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;) in North America, both of which are slightly heavier than the golden, is that the white-bellied sea eagle is the slightly smaller species than the wedge-tailed eagle, potentially giving the latter a more pronounced competitive edge. However, the white-bellied sea eagle clearly does not shy away from contentious border disputes with wedge-tailed eagles and the two species can often be seen be seen readily attacking each other, occasionally in talon grappling and sometimes cartwheeling attacks on one another. However, the ecological effect of interspecific competition of the two species is not clear. Although the wedge-tailed eagle is considered the dominant species of the two, they clearly do not take the presence of white-bellied sea eagles lightly and some authors feel they may avoid nesting near them. Clearly, there is ample partitioning between the wedge-tailed and white-bellied sea eagles, the latter adapted to mostly open wetlands and coasts and, while also a dietary generalist, they tend to derive most of their diet from fish, water birds and other wetland-dwelling prey, and they seldom compete directly for prey such as mammals with wedge-tailed eagles.

Most other diurnal raptors that reside in Australia are considerably smaller and seldom can be said to present great competition to the wedge-tailed eagles, although some, such as swamp harriers (&quot;Circus approximans&quot;), black-breasted kites and grey goshawks (&quot;Accipiter novaehollandiae&quot;), are relatively large for their taxon and powerful predators in their own rights. In one instance, a square-tailed kite (&quot;Lophoictinia isura&quot;) was observed to engage in an apparent territorial fight with a wedge-tailed eagle, including talon-grappling. When it comes to carrion, wedge-tailed eagles tend to dominate other predators, especially most birds, with most kites, other assorted raptors and some large passerine birds, mainly &quot;Corvus&quot; species and butcherbirds, coming to dead animals including roadkills. However, heavier terrestrial meat-eaters can hold their own at times against wedge-tailed eagles, namely red foxes, dingos, monitor lizards and Tasmanian devils, despite all these species sometimes turning up as prey of these eagles as well. Sometimes the wedge-tailed eagle will readily rob various other raptors of their prey, including little eagles, white-bellied sea eagles and brown falcons (&quot;Falco berigora&quot;). Wedge-tailed eagles will opportunistically prey on other birds of prey. They share this aptitude with other large eagles in different parts of the world such as golden eagles, although such acts are relatively infrequent, it is clear that the wedge-tailed eagle is considered a primary threat by many raptors based on witnessed attacks by eagles on them and the mobbing behaviour of other raptors. Among the other birds of prey known to occasionally fall prey to these eagles are little eagles, collared sparrowhawks (&quot;Accipiter cirrocephalus&quot;), grey goshawks, brown goshawks (&quot;Accipiter fasciatus&quot;), Pacific bazas (&quot;Aviceda subcristata&quot;), black-breasted buzzards, peregrine falcons (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;), Australian hobbies (&quot;Falco longipennis&quot;), black falcons (&quot;Falco subniger&quot;), brown falcons and Nankeen kestrels (&quot;Falco cenchroides&quot;). Occasionally owls are also included in the prey spectrum when an opportunity arises, including barn owls (&quot;Tyto javanica&quot;), southern boobooks (&quot;Ninox boobook&quot;) and even powerful owls (&quot;Ninox strenua&quot;). Wedge-tailed eagles are apex predators and have no well-documented predators, although presumably they have some nest predators, likely including ravens and currawongs, especially when displaced by human disturbance from their nests. Occasionally, these eagles may possibly risk injury or death in conflicts against other powerful predators and scavengers, such as dingos, quolls, Tasmanian devils, goannas and snakes, but no such verified instances seem to be known in literature, and man is considered to be the wedge-tailed eagle&#x27;s only true threat. Occasionally they may be injured and even killed via intra- and interspecies territorial conflicts and mobbing by other birds of prey, especially stooping peregrine falcons which have successfully knocked wedge-tailed eagles out of the sky, with a force known to kill both golden and bald eagles in other parts of the world. Due to the formidable aerial attack of the peregrine, it may be the only raptor besides the white-bellied sea eagle that wedge-tailed eagles may avoid nesting near. Most of the large falcons, including peregrine, brown and black falcons, and at times large owls nest in unused or abandoned wedge-tailed eagle nests.

==Breeding==
The breeding season is from July to December through much of range, in New Guinea apparently from May on. They have a distinct tendency that lay earlier in the more northerly part of the range. For instance, in northeastern Australia laying has been recorded in January and February and in Tasmania in September. In western Australia, breeding depends on food and during drought periods there may be no nesting for up to 4 years. Adult wedge-tailed eagles are usually solitary or occur in pairs but immatures are more gregarious. 10–15 young wedge-tailed eagles may rest or soar together or even hunt together and up to 40 have been recorded at once at a carcass. Mated adults perform mutual soaring, undulating dives, and tandem flights with rolling and foot-touching. The female may appear to ignore or more often turn over and present claws when a male is displaying. As possibly part of courtship feedings on pairs have taken place away from the nest and sharing of a cache of food may occur. Allopreening occurs occasionally between pairs but is seldom observed, although at times has been considered a “regular” part of the courtship process. Contrary to historical accounts, wedge-tailed eagles seldom engage in an elaborate courtship display and will instead generally try to conserve energy, instead devoting their energy for the upcoming trying breeding season along with territorial exclusions of conspecifics and obtaining food. Mating tends to occur on a bare branch or dead tree in the nest area, and may continue into the nestling period. Contrary to old accounts, the species does not mate in flight. In the pre-laying phase, mating was recorded to be preceded or accompanied by loud, slow yelping, but in the nestling period, the pair alighted together and the male mounted without preliminaries and a silent copulation lasted for one minute.

===Territories and home ranges===
Territories are established with aerial displays, which can include high circling by one or both of pair, sometimes interspersed with flight rolls and talon presenting. Most of the time, wedge-tailed eagles typically respect pair boundaries and can limit territorial behaviour to mild aerial flights, with the intruders usually giving the ground to incumbents. Violence is usually avoided but sometimes the most heated territorial disputes can escalate to deaths. Sometimes the displaying eagle may engage in a steep dive on part closed wings followed by an upwards swoop, later may escalate into spectacular sky dance with undulations; they may too loop-the-loop. Cartwheeling is typically rare but in one case, three immatures mock dived at each other, two birds interlocked and cartwheeled several times before breaking away. No cartwheeling or talon grappling has been reported between members of a mated pair, but occasionally reported as used against intruding eagles. Aerial displays may go on for a while normally early in the breeding season, between 3 months and 3 weeks prior to egg laying.

Territorial attacks by male wedge-tailed eagles may be against any encountered intruding eagles, including both male and female intruders, while female eagles engage in less territorial attacks and when they do, it is exclusively against other females. Territorial aggression can extend towards hang gliders and aircraft, advances noisily, bill open and talons extended until flying just above and behind or slightly ahead of pilot then swoops repeatedly after making contact with the hang-glider. A core of some radius around the nest is most fervently defended. Foraging ranges from nest may be up to about . Foraging ranges on breeding home ranges may be around for males and for females in arid central western Australia. Range sizes of pair members vary greatly based on topography, habitat and prey access. Several reported densities of 3–6 pairs per , others of 7–12 pairs per . When rabbits were in plague type numbers, pairs may nest as close apart and 4 others no more than from those two pairs. In semi-arid areas of New South Wales near Menindee densities were found to be about a pair per , 10–12 pairs in good years, 3 in drought years. Not far from that in Mutawintji National Park density was around a pair per . Much higher densities were noted in this semi-arid zone of western New South Wales, with a pair per , against around a pair per in other arid zones. In Western Australia, arid areas had a nearest neighbour distance of while those nesting in mesic areas had a distance of . At Fowlers Gap, there were 9–10 pairs per . Near Canberra, around 37 pairs were reported in an area of , including some unusually as close as to paved roads and as close as from suburban spots. This contrasts strongly with 36 years prior, when few nests were near human-altered areas and the amount of pairs in the same area was about 32. In the Fleurieu Peninsula in South Australia during the early to mid 2000s, there was a pair per , active nest sites were apart, while the average home range around the nest is roughly. Resurvey efforts a dozen years later in Fleurieu Peninsula found a more populous population, resulting in a home range estimated at with some active nests as close as apart. In the Perth area, it was projected that the mean home range was about . Meanwhile, in southern Victoria the nearest neighbour distance of breeding pairs was while mean territory size was calculated at .

===Nests===

Both sexes may participate in building the nest but the female takes the greater share, often standing in the middle and building outwards. Often wedge-tailed eagles build alternative nest, up to 2 to 3 per territory, though when undisturbed uses the same general site repeatedly. In Tasmania, territories held a mean of 1.4 nests. The nest is usually either substantial or massive. The nest is a structure of sticks ranging across and deep when first build but with repeated additions up to across and nearly deep. The interior nest cup is commonly around across about deep. Four studies found the diameter of nests to average from as little as and as much as and in depth from as little as to as much as . Generally speaking in woodland or forest edge areas, nests tend to be larger, while those in sparser, more arid areas tend to have characteristically smaller nests, as they have lesser access to nest building materials.

Good sized nests can weigh well over . Nests are usually lined with green leaves and twigs, a common practice in accipitrids. Infrequently, they may use an old nest built by another accipitrid, namely whistling kites (&quot;Haliastur sphenurus&quot;) and white-bellied sea eagles, with the earlier&#x27;s nests apparently added to in order to enlargen it. Ideally the nest is located at above the ground on a lateral branch or main fork of lone or forest tree; in taller trees, nests can be as much as high to the opposite extreme down in lower ground or even on rocks or ground trees are scarce. In a few studies different areas of New South Wales, the mean nest height was from and were often relatively close to human development. Two results in southern Victoria found mean nest heights to be . In often particularly arid Western Australia, mean nest heights were reportedly lower, averaging at . Detailed study in Western Australia found nest heights were higher in Mediterranean scrubland at against in the arid zone, but nest height seemed to not have bearing on occupancy or success, territoriality kept the population regulated within the habitats. Occasionally they may nest in dwarf trees at as low as .

Favoured nesting trees include many &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; and &quot;Casuarina&quot; species, as well as &quot;Corymbia&quot;, &quot;Callitris&quot; and &quot;Syncarpia glomulifera&quot; while in inland areas more often &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Flindersia&quot; as well as &quot;Hakea leucoptera&quot; and &quot;Grevillea striata&quot;. The amount of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; tree species used by wedge-tailed eagles is extremely diverse and ultimately the species seem to have no strong overall preferences regarding tree species, more importantly seeking a given tree of ample height and considerable broadness. Furthermore, nest trees are often on slightly elevated ground above the mean ground level, presumably in order to offer a more commanding view of the surrounding environment. Additionally, trees with fewer lower branches may be preferred. Nests are seldom on dead trees, usually this occurs where there is an absence of leafy ones. While Australian nests can be in quite varied surroundings, Tasmanian nests are almost exclusively within well forested areas. Forest type nests tend to have a sparse, open understory and woodlands or nearby glades often are considered perhaps more attractive to the species. In desert-type areas, they may nest on a hill or a rise, and in addition sometimes cliff ledges, or among rocks, and even on ground in both islands and desert-like areas, preferably in areas difficult for or inaccessible to humans. Additionally they&#x27;ve been known to nest on power pylons and telegraph poles. Other smaller animals may nest among the sticks at the base of active wedge-tailed eagle nests such as finches, pardalotes and even possums (which more so than the small birds are presumably vulnerable to the eagles if caught in the open), perhaps gaining some protection from the presence of the eagles. This is a not unknown phenomenon in many bird assemblages for small birds to gain incidental protection from strong raptors. Other species, such as Pacific black ducks (&quot;Anas superciliosa&quot;), falcons and owls, may also benefit by utilizing unused nests for their own breeding purposes, although typically only the falcons usually use them with relative regularity.

===Development of young and parental behaviour===

Clutch size is usually just one or two but sometimes to 4. About 80% of nests where eagles have managed to lay eggs contain two eggs. Mean clutch size is apparently somewhat higher in the western part of the range. The female lays multi-egg clutches by some 3 days or so apart. The eggs are buff or white in colour, often appearing heavily blotched all over with purple-brown, red-brown or lavender, or more sparsely spotted with reddish brown. The amount of spotting is quite variable on eggs even within a single clutch, some being heavily marked, others hardly at all, and at times concentrated on the pointier end of the egg. When freshly laid, the eggs are glossy but they become more matte and brittle with age.

Eggs may range in height from , averaging in a sample of 54, by , averaging . Each egg normally weighs about , the equivalent to about three chicken eggs or about 3% of the female eagle&#x27;s body weight, 10% when the clutch number is 3, which is typical for an &quot;Aquila&quot; eagle but a small percentage relative to smaller raptors. The larger eagles of Tasmania lay larger eggs on average reportedly. Wedge-tailed eagles sometimes lay runt eggs in nests in normal nests, in a condition apparently unique for Australian raptors, and these reportedly never hatch. If a clutch is lost or stolen early in incubation, some pairs have been documented to replace it, being able to do so about a month later. The incubation stage lasts for 42–48 days. The female of the pair either primarily or entirely incubates on her own and, like many eagles, she is a tight sitter. However, the male will incubate at times as well, at least up to an hour at a time. In New South Wales, the male was found to incubate for 16–20% of daylight during which the nest was unguarded for 3–13% of the day. In some cases, male incubation may vary from 1–6% of daylight to as much as 38% of daylight with shifts in extreme lasting up to 6 hours. Male primarily delivers prey to the nest during incubation (not prior), up about to the stage where the eaglet(s) can be left unattended.

The chicks are covered in white down up at first and are expectedly semi-altricial. At about 12 days or so, a slightly greyer down develops and this ultimately becomes the woolly undercoat for the contour feathers. Within a couple days later, the black quills of the primaries often start to emerge, and can start to stand and move around the nest. At 28 days, the eaglets are showing their upper wing coverts increasingly through the down. At 35 days of age, some darker feathers are appearing on areas such as the breast, belly, mantle, back and head; mostly these are evident as a few dark rufous feathers poking through the head down while at this age they show a short buff-tipped tail. They are partially feathered up to 37 days and nearly completely feathered by 49 days. At around 37 days, they can attempt to tear food from carcass in the nests without much success. From 50 days onwards, the eaglet(s) play a good deal, pouncing on sticks and degree around the nest. Around this age, they are markedly almost full feathered but for the wing and tail, neither of which has reached its full length, and they may have a few wisps of down about their crown or neck. Weight increases are from about at 15 days with a notably increase in robustness to at 29 days, to at 49 days, making more rapid feathering growth thereafter primarily while body size growth slows considerably. Sibling aggression tends to begin at very early stage of life and decrease after first week. Unlike related eagles, there is some evidence that higher parental attendance limits instances of aggression, whereas in other eagles this occurs often in the parent&#x27;s presence. In all eagles, the parent eagles do not attempt to intercede when runting or aggression between siblings occurs. Siblicide occurs occasionally in this species and it is considered a “facultative cainist” rather than an obligate one, meaning siblicide occurs occasionally and as conditions dictate as opposed to some eagles where it occurs almost invariably. Sufficient environmental conditions can largely reduce sibling aggression. In New South Wales, three of four successful pairs raised two fledglings and no sign of rivalry or pecking behaviors observed despite the size difference of two siblings.

The female broods attentively at first but then decreases after the second or third week and then ceases brooding almost entirely by 30 days, even at night. For 40 or more days, the female continues to assist the young with feeding, typically from the male&#x27;s prey deliveries though the female may resume hunting after nest attendance drops. Potential predators such as goannas are struck when found to be approaching the nest, although the eagles usually abandon the nest when a human approaches. Repeated intrusions and noisy disturbances may have a net negative effect such as on Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles, as these factors often lead to nest failure. In one case in South Australia, the removal of a dead tree in the vicinity of a wedge-tailed eagle nest resulted in full abandonment of the nest by the parents. The female may too continue to bring green leaves to a late stages, doing so more often in a spell of wet weather. During times of plenty, caches can sometimes form around the nest, with much prey left partially or entirely uneaten. Upon leaving the nest at 11 to 12 weeks of age, the young eagles are not strong fliers for another 20 days or so, but can competent flying can be by about 90 days of ages, though full feather development is not until 120 days. Fledgling occurs at 67 to 95 days, typically being less than 90 days and averaging roughly around 79 days.

Dependence lasts up to 4 to 6 months after fledging, with the juvenile eagles which overstay rarely known to be an occasionally fatal danger to the subsequent chick hatched to their parents. During the later periods of fledgling, interactions are restricted to brief prey deliveries and the parent eagles stop feeding the young eagle(s), forcing to go forage elsewhere for foods. A study of post-fledgling dispersal found in one case that a young eagle covered only a range, with a maximum covered in a week of . Most recoveries in one banding study were distributed under from their original banding site, mostly as fledgling age juveniles, but some meandered up to away. After dispersal, young eagles are floaters up until their 4th or 5th year, typically avoiding the territories of adults and searching out feeding opportunities. Up to two-thirds of young wedge-tailed eagles may die some time between fledgling and when they are 3–5 years but adults often have quite low mortality rates and can live the better part of a half century. First breeding is typically at 6 or 7 years old. Lifespans of wedge-tailed eagles in the wild are poorly known, with the maximum recorded in one banding study being merely 9 years, quite a paltry age compared to other large eagles, and it is quite conceivable that eagles who survive to maturity not infrequently live around twice that long or more. In captivity, the species has been known to live to around 40 years of age.

===Breeding success===
Only one young is typically produced from a clutch of two but occasionally two fledglings may occur. The breeding success rates of the species are variable. In overall studies, at least 52 to 90% of breeding pairs managed to produce a fledgling, with further projected numbers from this of 0.2–0.5 fledgling per pair, 0.7–1.2 fledgling per clutch and 1.1–1.3 fledgling per brood. In southwestern Australia, from 0.7 to 1.2 young are fledged per clutch laid, 0.19–0.46 young per pair per year. In south-central Queensland, fledgling productivity was 1.1 per young to pairs that laid eggs. Northern New South Wales eagles were able to produce 0.8 young per pair from 2005 to 2006 while 0.89 and 0.64 fledged young per pair per year was the fledgling rate in central and western New South Wales, respectively. In a further study in New South Wales at Burrendong Dam, from 1993 to 2003, 15 pairs produced an average of one fledgling per territory but 1998 due to drought conditions, the rate was only 0.4 chick per territory. Within Kinchega National Park, however, the rate of 0.99 young per pair was fairly consistent regardless of climatic conditions. In the Australian Capital Territory, pairs were said to produce 1.1 fledglings per pair. In southeastern Australia, from 0.9 to 1.5 young per clutch are laid, with 0.6–1.0 young per pair per year. In Tasmania, from 0.64 to 0.8 young are fledged per clutch laid, 1.07 per successful nest. 0.91 young were produced per pair in southern South Australia or 1.1 fledglings per successful nesting attempt.

Subsequent research in South Australia found 38 successfully fledged young with 10 pairs or 26% producing two fledglings and that production was 1.1 per occupied territory and 1.3 per successful pair. 0.73 fledglings were produced pair per year in south-west Western Australia. Western Australian eagles produced 0.92 fledged young per clutch laid and 1.1 young per successful nest. During periods of drought in Western Australia, some wedge-tailed eagles may forgo breeding for up to four years. Higher annual rainfall in Western Australia, higher in mesic than arid areas, made a big difference in pair productivity, with 12% of arid zone pairs producing young, or 0.13 fledglings per pair, a very low productivity, while the mesic zone 69% of pairs produced fledglings, or 0.77 fledglings per pair. Generally, wedge-tailed eagles can nest in a variety of habitats and climatic conditions but tend to be slightly less productive in more arid environments. Significant broad-scale control is thought to be unlikely to be harming numbers of young being produced with those with a macropod-based diet perhaps having a richer diet. Like most eagles, wedge-tailed eagles fit the mould rather well of a K-selected breeder, i.e. being large, producing fewer young and tending to live relatively long.

==Conservation status==

In the 1990s, it was estimated broadly that the global population was somewhere between 10,001 and 1,000,000 individuals. As of 2009, Birdlife International listed the total population as only 100,000 mature individuals, possibly conservative and from admittedly poor supporting data. As of that analysis, Birdlife considers the overall population of wedge-tailed eagles to be “possibly increasing”. Generally, the wedge-tailed eagle appears to be quite stable in population. Although wedge-tailed eagles are often scarcer than those large distribution suggests, their total distribution covers more than 10.5 million square kilometres and the population is quite likely within hundreds of thousands. Thinning of forest cover, mostly inadvertent provisioning of carrion food sources and, particularly, rabbit introductions may have aided the species, and it may actually be commoner now than before European colonization. Though protected, sometimes wedge-tailed eagles are shot or trapped or killed by poison carcasses set out by farmers many of whom consider it a serious sheep killer. Historically, the wedge-tailed eagle was subject to persecution levels to rival any other eagle in the world. The heavy persecution began in the closing decades of the 19th century, due largely to the establishment of large-scale sheep farming in Australia. One Queensland station claimed to have poisoned 1060 eagles over 8 months in 1903.

Laws passed from 1909 to 1925 made it mandatory for landowners and farmers to kill eagles as vermin with enforcement determined by a given region&#x27;s minister or vermin board, resulting in even more sweeping efforts to destroy the species. Steel-jawed rabbit traps were set around carcasses and Heligoland traps could sometimes trap several eagles at once, beyond sustained shooting and poisoning efforts. Between the years 1958 and 1967, 120,000 bounties were paid in merely the states of Queensland and Western Australia on wedge-tailed eagles killed, meaning an average 13,000 were killed each year. Even by 1967 to 1976, likely intentional human killings accounted for 54% of wedge-tailed eagle mortalities in Western Australia, with an estimated 30,000 killed in the year of 1969 throughout Australia. Strong legal protections started in Western Australia in the 1950s increasingly so to the 1970s or later elsewhere, now it is protected and subject to limited persecution throughout. Despite reduced persecution, as of the 1980s, 54% of recovered eagles by the 1980s were killed by human persecution. Despite such stunningly high rates of persecution, the wedge-tailed eagle was remarkably resilient to the haphazard persecution inflicted by humans in a way many other Australian wildlife, especially the regionally endemic mammals, and even other eagles elsewhere often are not.

Often the species is less intentionally harmed via human disturbance via land development particularly intensifying agricultural and modern settlements, which can in turn lead to clearing of mature trees, disturbances at the nest and decline of native prey species, all of which have a net negative effect on the wedge-tailed eagles. Eggshell thickness was not significantly decreased by the use of DDT likely due likely to the largely mammal-based diet of the species, whereas raptors which consume birds or fish are disproportionately effected by DDT. On occasion, the species is still subject to illegal shootings and poisonings, however persecution of the species is significantly less prevalent in recent decades. Occasionally but not commonly, they are killed by sodium fluoroacetate poisons long used to “control” Australian wildlife, but now generally directed at invasive species such as rabbits, feral pigs and foxes. A list of the main persistent threats in the 21st century to wedge-tailed eagles consists of: destruction of habitat, including logging, developments including urbanization, wind farm collisions and the disturbance and destruction associated with their construction, increasing density rural human populations, illegal persecution in sheep farm areas, drowning in open tanks in dry pastoral zones, roadkills (especially while foraging for roadkill carrion), collisions with fences, powerlines and airplanes, regular electrocutions, poisoning from rabbit baits and other baits and exposure to lead and other bullet fragments which may be responsible for some eagle debilitations and deaths. Within the Fleurieu Peninsula, some 1.74 eagles on average are claimed by wind farm turbine collisions.

Conservation needs may differ in different habitats, i.e. in more coastal temperate areas, the eagle is reported to have difficulty nesting when hillsides have been cleared of trees, meanwhile inland, they have lesser need of trees in elevated locations because they are more often assisted by thermals. However, they cannot generally persist where leafy trees are clearcut. Surprising resilience even to drought was found recently in the wedge-tailed eagles in the Australian Capital Territory where pair occupancy remained consistent through drought for wedge-tailed eagles but not for little eagles, but this is may have more to do with the wedge-tails more successful uncoupling from a dependence on declining rabbits as prey than the little eagle. Of 84 eagle deaths or debilitating injuries, 52% were attributable to collisions or electrocutions, 15.5% due to persecution, 11% due to natural causes and 15% were due to unknown causes.

===Status in Tasmania===
The Tasmanian race of wedge-tailed eagle, &quot;A. a. fleayi&quot;, is quite restricted in range and habitat, with estimated numbers having gone from 140 pairs in the 1980s down to only 60–80 by the mid-1990s. With the island&#x27;s population numbering quite low and likely continuing its declining, as evidenced by slow replacement of lost pair members, the subspecies is listed as state-endangered. Furthermore, surveys contrasting 1977–1981 with 1998–2001 data found a decline of around 28% in the island&#x27;s reported number of eagles. Generally Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles are even less tolerant of human alterations and disturbances near the nest site than mainland wedge-tailed eagles and have more specific habitat requirements. Historically, the same hunting organization in Tasmania that played a large role in the extinction of the thylacine (&quot;Thylacinus cynocephalus&quot;) also intentionally tried to hunt the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle into extinction, publicly having erroneously claimed that eagles were non-native in Tasmania; however, hunting is unlikely to further continue on a large scale in the state. Where habitat clearance and degradation is extensive in Tasmania, the native prey populations are insufficient to support eagles. Furthermore, the clearing or logging of trees is especially critical in Tasmania, where the eagle is by and large a forest-dependent breeder.

Studies indicate that Tasmanian eagles mostly nest in emergent trees in old-growth native forest exposed to early morning sun and sheltered from prevailing strong winds and cold spring winds, given the more temperate climate there relative to most points in mainland Australia. The subspecies requires forest areas greater than in which to breed and is very prone to desert its nest when disturbed. A predicted change was calculated to the carrying capacity of the Tasmanian forest given current operations is modeled, likely driving the population down. Wind farms in Tasmania are also an occasional threat; although not thought to be a significant source of mortality, wedge-tailed eagles, especially young ones, are less success at avoiding invariably fatal collisions with them than Tasmanian white-bellied sea eagles. Furthermore, of 109 eagle carcasses recovered in Tasmania, all of them had trace levels of lead in their livers or femurs with at least part of the exposure likely from lead ammunition. In addition, like all eagles, Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles are vulnerable to electrocutions, and collisions with vehicles, overhead wires, and fences and poisonings, largely via illegal killings by poachers of Tasmanian devils and forest ravens (&quot;Corvus tasmanicus&quot;). Efforts are underway to ameliorate the harm being done to Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles, especially via forestry operations.

In protected areas, protocols are in place to protect Tasmanian eagle nests and protect them by creating an obligatory nest reserve of at least 10 ha and forestry operation have been restricted during the breeding season to outside a buffer zone of , extending further to if the proposed work is in the line-of-sight of the nesting eagles. About 20% of known pairs are outside protected areas and on private land, so are largely outside the strict legal protection the subspecies has on governmental forest land. Furthermore, researchers are instituting rules to minimize disturbance, limiting breeding surveys to distant observations of whitewash and flattened treetops as proof of nesting and all detailed observations to be obtained after the cessation of breeding activities.

==Iconography==
The bird is an emblem of the Northern Territory. The Parks and Wildlife Service of the Northern Territory uses the wedge-tailed eagle, superimposed over a map of the Northern Territory, as their emblem. The New South Wales Police Force emblem contains a wedge-tailed eagle in flight, as does the Northern Territory Correctional Services. La Trobe University in Melbourne also uses the wedge-tailed eagle in its corporate logo and coat of arms. The wedge-tailed eagle is also a symbol of the Australian Defence Force, featuring prominently on the ADF Flag, and the Royal Australian Air Force and Australian Air Force Cadets both use a wedge-tailed eagle on their badges. The Royal Australian Air Force has named its airborne early warning and control aircraft after the bird, the Boeing E-7 Wedgetail.

Early in 1967, the Australian Army 2nd Cavalry Regiment received its new badge, a wedge-tailed eagle swooping, carrying a lance-bearing the motto &quot;Courage&quot; in its talons. The regiment&#x27;s mascot is a wedge-tailed eagle named &quot;Courage&quot;. Since its formation, there have been two, Courage I and Courage II. In 1997, while on flight training with his handlers, Corporal Courage II refused to cooperate and flew away, not being found for two days following an extensive search. He was charged with being AWOL and reduced to the rank of trooper. He was promoted back to corporal in 1998.

The West Coast Eagles, an AFL football club from Western Australia, uses a stylised wedge-tailed eagle as their club emblem. In recent years, they have had a real-life wedge-tailed eagle named &quot;Auzzie&quot; perform tricks before matches.

<doc id="199884" wikidata="Q7107631" url="?curid=199884" title="Osteopathic medicine in the United States">
<text>Osteopathic medicine is a branch of the medical profession in the United States that promotes the practice of science-based medicine, often referred to in this context as allopathic medicine, with a set of philosophy and principles set by its earlier form, osteopathy.
Osteopathic physicians (DOs) are graduates of American osteopathic medical colleges and are licensed to practice the full scope of medicine and surgery in all 50 U.S. states. The field is distinct from osteopathic practices offered in nations outside of the U.S.in which practitioners are generally considered neither parts of core medical staff nor of medicine itself; rather, they are considered alternative medicine practitioners. The other major branch of medicine in the United States is referred to by practitioners of osteopathic medicine as allopathic medicine.

By the middle of the 20th century, the profession had moved closer to mainstream medicine. American &quot;osteopaths&quot; became &quot;osteopathic medical doctors&quot;, ultimately achieving full practice rights as medical doctors in all 50 states.

In modern medicine in the U.S., any distinction between the MD and the DO professions has eroded steadily. The training of osteopathic physicians in the United States is now virtually indistinguishable from the training of allopathic physicians (MDs). Osteopathic physicians attend four years of medical school like their MD counterparts, acquiring equivalent education in medicine and surgery; DOs also attend the same graduate medical education programs (ACGME-accredited residencies and fellowships) as their MD counterparts to acquire their licenses as physicians. DOs use all conventional methods of diagnosis and treatment and practice across all specialties of medicine and surgery. Although osteopathic physicians are still trained in osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), the modern derivative of Andrew Taylor Still&#x27;s techniques, during medical school, the majority of practicing physicians with a DO degree do not practice OMT in their daily work. There are ongoing debates about the utility of maintaining separate, distinct pathways for educating physicians in the United States.

==Nomenclature==
Physicians and surgeons who graduate from osteopathic medical schools are known as osteopathic physicians or osteopathic medical doctors. Upon graduation, they are conferred a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) medical degree.

Osteopathic curricula in countries other than the United States differ from those in the United States. European-trained practitioners of osteopathic manipulative techniques are referred to as &quot;osteopaths&quot;: their scope of practice excludes most medical therapies and relies more on osteopathic manipulative medicine and alternative medical modalities. While it was once common for DO graduates in the United States to refer to themselves as &quot;osteopaths&quot;, this term is now considered archaic. Those holding the DO degree are commonly referred to as &quot;osteopathic physicians&quot;, and they learn, train in, and practice the full scope of mainstream evidence-based medicine and surgery.

==Demographics==

 40 medical schools were offering DO degrees in 64 locations across the United States, while there were 155 accredited MD medical schools (2021–2022).
* In 1960, 13,708 physicians were graduates of the 5 osteopathic medical schools.
* Between 1980 and 2005, the number of osteopathic graduates per year increased by over 150 percent, from about 1,000 to 2,800. This number was expected to approach 5,000 by 2015.
* In 2016, there were 33 colleges of osteopathic medicine in 48 locations, in 31 states. One in four medical students in the United States in 2016 was enrolled in an osteopathic medical school.
* there were more than 145,000 osteopathic physicians and osteopathic medical students in the United States.
Osteopathic physicians are not evenly distributed in the United States. States with the highest concentration of osteopathic physicians are Oklahoma, Iowa, and Michigan, where osteopathic physicians comprised 17–20% of the physician workforce in 2011. The state with the greatest number of osteopathic physicians is Pennsylvania, with 8,536 DOs in active practice in 2018. The states with the lowest concentrations of DOs are Washington, D.C., North Dakota, and Vermont, where only 1–3% of physicians have an osteopathic medical degree. Public awareness of osteopathic medicine likewise varies widely in different regions. In 2003, people living in Midwest states were the most likely to be familiar with osteopathic medicine. In the Northeastern United States, osteopathic physicians provided more than one-third of general and family medicine patient visits between 2003 and 2004.

Between 2010 and 2015, twelve states experienced greater than 50% growth in the number of DOs: Virginia, South Carolina, Utah, Tennessee, North Dakota, Kentucky, South Dakota, Wyoming, Oregon, North Carolina, Minnesota, and Washington.

==Osteopathic principles==
Osteopathic medical students take the Osteopathic Oath, similar to the Hippocratic oath, to maintain and uphold the &quot;core principles&quot; of osteopathic medical philosophy. Revised in 1953, and again in 2002, the core principles are:
# The body is a unit; a person is a unit of body, mind, and spirit.
# The body is capable of self-regulation, self-healing, and health maintenance.
# Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated.
# Rational treatment is based on an understanding of these principles: body unity, self-regulation, and the interrelationship of structure and function.

Contemporary osteopathic physicians practice evidence-based medicine, indistinguishable from their MD colleagues.

===Significance===
There are different opinions on the significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others point out that there is nothing in the principles that would distinguish DO from MD training in any fundamental way. One study, published in &quot;The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association&quot; found a majority of MD medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.

==History==

===19th century, a new movement within medicine===

Frontier physician Andrew Taylor Still, DO founded the American School of Osteopathy (now the A.T. Still University-Kirksville (Mo.) College of Osteopathic Medicine) in Kirksville, Missouri in 1892 as a radical protest against the turn-of-the-century medical system. A.T. Still believed that the conventional medical system lacked credible efficacy, was morally corrupt and treated effects rather than causes of disease. He founded osteopathic medicine in rural Missouri at a time when medications, surgery, and other traditional therapeutic regimens often caused more harm than good. Some of the medicines commonly given to patients during this time were arsenic, castor oil, whiskey, and opium. In addition, unsanitary surgical practices often resulted in more deaths than cures.

 The new profession faced stiff opposition from the medical establishment at the time. The relationship of the osteopathic and medical professions was often &quot;bitterly contentious&quot; and involved &quot;strong efforts&quot; by medical organizations to discredit osteopathic medicine. Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, the policy of the American Medical Association labeled osteopathic medicine as a cult. The AMA Code of ethics declared it unethical for a medical physician to voluntarily associate with an osteopath.

One notable advocate for the fledgling movement was Mark Twain. Manipulative treatments had purportedly alleviated the symptoms of his daughter Jean&#x27;s epilepsy as well as Twain&#x27;s own chronic bronchitis. In 1909, he spoke before the New York State Assembly at a hearing regarding the practice of osteopathy in the state. &quot;I don&#x27;t know as I cared much about these osteopaths until I heard you were going to drive them out of the state, but since I heard that I haven&#x27;t been able to sleep.&quot; Philosophically opposed to the American Medical Association&#x27;s stance that its own type of medical practice was the only legitimate one, he spoke in favor of licensing for osteopaths. Physicians from the New York County Medical Society responded with a vigorous attack on Twain, who retorted with &quot;[t]he physicians think they are moved by regard for the best interests of the public. Isn&#x27;t there a little touch of self-interest back of it all?&quot; &quot;... The objection is, people are curing people without a license and you are afraid it will bust up business.&quot;

Following an accreditation survey in 1903, the American Osteopathic Association began requiring 3-year curricula at osteopathic medical schools. In 1916, the AOA mandated all DO schools expand programs to four years. In 1929, osteopathic medical schools began teaching pharmacology as a part of the curricula.

===1916–1966, federal recognition===
Recognition by the US federal government was a key goal of the osteopathic medical profession in its effort to establish equivalency with its MD counterparts. Between 1916 and 1966, the profession engaged in a &quot;long and tortuous struggle&quot; for the right to serve as physicians and surgeons in the US Military Medical Corps. On May 3, 1966 Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara authorized the acceptance of osteopathic physicians into all the medical military services on the same basis as MDs. The first osteopathic physician to take the oath of office to serve as a military physician was Harry J. Walter. The acceptance of osteopathic physicians was further solidified in 1996 when Ronald Blanck, DO was appointed to serve as Surgeon General of the Army, the only osteopathic physician to hold the post.

===1962, California===

In the 1960s in California, the American Medical Association (AMA) spent nearly $8 million to end the practice of osteopathic medicine in the state. In 1962, Proposition 22, a statewide ballot initiative in California, eliminated the practice of osteopathic medicine in the state. The California Medical Association (CMA) issued MD degrees to all DOs in the state of California for a nominal fee. &quot;By attending a short seminar and paying $65, a doctor of osteopathy (DO) could obtain an MD degree; 86 percent of the DOs in the state (out of a total of about 2000) chose to do so.&quot; Immediately following, the AMA re-accredited the University of California at Irvine College of Osteopathic Medicine as the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, an MD medical school. It also placed a ban on issuing physician licenses to DOs moving to California from other states. However, the decision proved to be controversial. In 1974, after protests and lobbying by influential and prominent DOs, the California Supreme Court ruled in Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons of California v. California Medical Association, that licensing of DOs in that state must be resumed. Four years later, in 1978, the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific opened in Pomona, and in 1997, Touro University California opened in Vallejo. As of 2012, there were 6,368 DOs practicing in California.

===1969, AMA House of Delegates approval===

In 1969, the American Medical Association (AMA) approved a measure allowing qualified osteopathic physicians to be full and active members of the Association. The measure also allowed osteopathic physicians to participate in AMA-approved intern and residency programs. However, the American Osteopathic Association rejected this measure, claiming it was an attempt to eliminate the distinctiveness of osteopathic medicine. In 1970, AMA President Dwight L. Wilbur sponsored a measure in the AMA&#x27;s House of Delegates permitting the AMA Board of Trustees&#x27; plan for the merger of DO and MD professions. Today, a majority of osteopathic physicians are trained alongside MDs, in residency programs governed by the ACGME, an independent board of the AMA.

===1993, first African-American woman to serve as dean of a US medical school===

In 1993, Barbara Ross-Lee, DO, was appointed to the position of dean of the Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine; she was the first African-American woman to serve as the dean of a US medical school. 

===Non-discrimination policies===
Recent years have seen a professional rapprochement between the two groups. DOs have been admitted to full active membership in the American Medical Association since 1969. The AMA has invited a representative of the American Osteopathic Association to sit as a voting member in the AMA legislative body, the house of delegates.

====2006, American Medical Student Association====
In 2006, during the presidency of an osteopathic medical student, the American Medical Student Association (AMSA) adopted a policy regarding the membership rights of osteopathic medical students in their main policy document, the &quot;Preamble, Purposes and Principles.&quot;
====2007, AMA====
In recent years, the largest MD organization in the US, the American Medical Association, adopted a fee non-discrimination policy discouraging differential pricing based on attendance of an MD or DO medical school.

In 2006, calls for an investigation into the existence of differential fees charged for visiting DO and MD medical students at American medical schools were brought to the American Medical Association. After an internal investigation into the fee structure for visiting DO and MD medical students at MD medical schools, it was found that one institution of the 102 surveyed charged different fees for DO and MD students. The house of delegates of the American Medical Association adopted resolution 809, I-05 in 2007.
===State licensing of practice rights===
In the United States, laws regulating physician licenses are governed by the states. Between 1896 and 1973, osteopathic physicians lobbied state legislatures to pass laws giving those with a DO degree the same legal privilege to practice medicine as those with an MD degree. In many states, the debate was long and protracted. Both the AOA and the AMA were heavily involved in influencing the legislative process. The first state to pass such a law was Vermont in 1896, the last was Mississippi in 1973.

==Current status==

===Education and training===

According to Harrison&#x27;s Principles of Internal Medicine, &quot;the training, practice, credentialing, licensure, and reimbursement of osteopathic physicians is virtually indistinguishable from those of (MD) physicians, with 4 years of osteopathic medical school followed by specialty and subspecialty training and [board] certification.&quot;

DO-granting US medical schools have curricula similar to those of MD-granting schools. Generally, the first two years are classroom-based, while the third and fourth years consist of clinical rotations through the major specialties of medicine. Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine have been criticized by the osteopathic community for relying too heavily on clinical rotations with private practitioners, who may not be able to provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student. 

====Graduate medical education====
Osteopathic physicians may apply to residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). The AOA ceased graduate medical education accreditation activities in 2020.

==Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT)==

Within the osteopathic medical curriculum, manipulative treatment is taught as an adjunctive measure to other biomedical interventions for several disorders and diseases. However, a 2001 survey of osteopathic physicians found that more than 50% of the respondents used OMT on less than 5% of their patients. The survey follows many indicators that osteopathic physicians have become more like MD physicians in every respect —few perform OMT, and most prescribe medications or suggest surgery as the first line of treatment.
The American Osteopathic Association has made an effort in recent years to support scientific inquiry into the effectiveness of osteopathic manipulation as well as to encourage osteopathic physicians to consistently offer manipulative treatments to their patients. However, the number of osteopathic physicians who report consistently prescribing and performing manipulative treatment has been falling steadily. Medical historian and sociologist Norman Gevitz cites poor educational quarters and few full-time OMT instructors as major factors for the decreasing interest of medical students in OMT. He describes problems with &quot;the quality, breadth, nature, and orientation of OMM instruction,&quot; and he claims that the teaching of osteopathic medicine has not changed sufficiently over the years to meet the intellectual and practical needs of students.

At the same time, recent studies show an increasingly positive attitude of patients and physicians (MD and DO) toward the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe, and effective treatment modality. One survey, published in the &quot;Journal of Continuing Medical Education&quot;, found that a majority of physicians (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual manipulation (MM) was safe, and over half (56% of physicians and 59% of patients) felt that manipulation should be available in the primary care setting. Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of MD residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the MD residents responded favorably to the experience.

===Professional attitudes===
In 1998, an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the increasing numbers, public awareness, and mainstreaming of osteopathic medical physicians, illustrating an increasingly cooperative climate between the DO and MD professions.

In 2005, during his tenure as president of the Association of American Medical Colleges, Jordan Cohen described a climate of cooperation between DO and MD practitioners: 

===International practice rights===

Each country has different requirements and procedures for licensing or registering osteopathic physicians and osteopaths. The only osteopathic practitioners that the US Department of Education recognizes as physicians are graduates of osteopathic medical colleges in the United States.

The &quot;Bureau on International Osteopathic Medical Education and Affairs&quot; (BIOMEA) is an independent board of the American Osteopathic Association. The BIOMEA monitors the licensing and registration practices of physicians in countries outside of the United States and advances the recognition of American-trained DOs. Towards this end, the BIOMEA works with international health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) as well as other groups.

The procedure by which countries consider granting physician licensure to foreigners varies widely. For US-trained physicians, the ability to qualify for &quot;unlimited practice rights&quot; also varies according to one&#x27;s degree, MD or DO. 

According to Josh Kerr of the AOA, &quot;some countries don’t understand the differences in training between an osteopathic physician and an osteopath.&quot; The American Medical Student Association strongly advocates for US-trained DO international practice rights &quot;equal to that&quot; of MD-qualified physicians.

===In primary care===
Osteopathic physicians have historically entered primary care fields at a higher rate than their MD counterparts. Some osteopathic organizations make claims to a greater emphasis on the importance of primary care within osteopathic medicine. However, the proportion of osteopathic students choosing primary care fields, like that of their MD peers, is declining. Currently, only one in five osteopathic medical students enters a family medicine residency (the largest primary care field). In 2004, only 32% of osteopathic seniors planned careers in any primary care field; this percentage was down from a peak in 1996 of more than 50%.

==Criticism and internal debate==

===OMT===

Traditional osteopathic medicine, specifically OMT, has been criticized for using techniques such as cranial and cranio-sacral manipulation. CST has been described as pseudoscience which is not backed up by any scientific evidence. Medical research has found no good evidence that either CST or cranial osteopathy confers any health benefit, and they can be harmful, particularly if used on children or infants. The basic assumptions of CST are challenged by some medical doctors, and practitioners produce conflicting and mutually exclusive diagnoses of the same patients.

===Research emphasis===
Another area of criticism has been the relative lack of research and lesser emphasis on scientific inquiry at DO schools in comparison with MD schools. 

===Identity crisis===
A debate exists within the osteopathic community over the feasibility of maintaining osteopathic medicine as a distinct entity within US health care. J. D. Howell, author of &quot;The Paradox of Osteopathy,&quot; notes claims of a &quot;fundamental yet ineffable difference&quot; between MD and DO qualified physicians are based on practices such as &quot;preventive medicine and seeing patients in a sociological context&quot; that are &quot;widely encountered not only in osteopathic medicine but also in allopathic medicine.&quot; Studies have confirmed the lack of any &quot;philosophic concept or resultant practice behavior&quot; that would distinguish a DO from an MD. Howell summarizes the questions framing the debate over the future of osteopathic distinctiveness thus:

====Rapid expansion====
As the number of osteopathic schools has increased, the debate over distinctiveness has often seen the leadership of the American Osteopathic Association at odds with the community of osteopathic physicians.
The rapid expansion has raised concerns about the number of available faculty at osteopathic schools and the role that those faculty play in maintaining the integrity of the academic program of the schools. Norman Gevitz, author of the leading text on the history of osteopathic medicine, wrote in 2009,

The president of the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine commented on the current climate of crisis within the profession.

<doc id="199885" wikidata="Q4814791" url="?curid=199885" title="White Nile">
<text>The White Nile ( &quot;&quot;) is a river in Africa, the minor of the two main tributaries of the Nile, the larger being the Blue Nile. The name &quot;White&quot; comes from the clay sediment carried in the water that changes the water to a pale color.

In the strict meaning, &quot;White Nile&quot; refers to the river formed at Lake No, at the confluence of the Bahr al Jabal and Bahr el Ghazal Rivers. In the wider sense, &quot;White Nile&quot; refers to all the stretches of river draining from Lake Victoria through to the merger with the Blue Nile: the &quot;Victoria Nile&quot; from Lake Victoria via Lake Kyoga to Lake Albert, then the &quot;Albert Nile&quot; to the South Sudan border, and then the &quot;Mountain Nile&quot; or &quot;Bahr-al-Jabal&quot; down to Lake No. &quot;White Nile&quot; may sometimes include the headwaters of Lake Victoria, the most remote of which being from the Blue Nile.

The 19th-century search by Europeans for the source of the Nile was mainly focused on the White Nile, which disappeared into the depths of what was then known as &quot;Darkest Africa&quot;.
== Course ==

=== Headwaters ===
The Kagera River, which flows into Lake Victoria near the Tanzanian town of Bukoba, is the longest feeder river for Lake Victoria, although sources do not agree on which is the longest tributary of the Kagera, and hence the most distant source of the Nile. The source of the Nile can be considered to be either the Ruvyironza, which emerges in Bururi Province, Burundi (near Bukirasaz), or the Nyabarongo, which flows from Nyungwe Forest in Rwanda.

These two feeder rivers meet near Rusumo Falls on the border between Rwanda and Tanzania. These waterfalls are known for an event on 28–29 April 1994, when 250,000 Rwandans crossed the bridge at Rusumo Falls into Ngara, Tanzania, in 24 hours, in what the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees called &quot;the largest and fastest refugee exodus in modern times&quot;. The Kagera forms part of the Rwanda–Tanzania and Tanzania–Uganda borders before flowing into Lake Victoria.

=== In Uganda ===
The White Nile in Uganda goes under the name of &quot;Victoria Nile&quot; from Lake Victoria via Lake Kyoga to Lake Albert, and then as the &quot;Albert Nile&quot; from there to the border with South Sudan.

==== Victoria Nile ====

The Victoria Nile starts at the outlet of Lake Victoria, at Jinja, Uganda, on the northern shore of the lake. Downstream from the Nalubaale Power Station and the Kiira Power Station at the outlet of the lake, the river goes over Bujagali Falls (the location of the Bujagali Power Station) about downstream from Jinja. The river then flows northwest through Uganda to Lake Kyoga in the centre of the country, thence west to Lake Albert.

At Karuma Falls, the river flows under Karuma Bridge () at the southeastern corner of Murchison Falls National Park. During much of the insurgency of the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army, Karuma Bridge, built in 1963 to help the cotton industry, was the key stop on the way to Gulu, where vehicles gathered in convoys before being provided with a military escort for the final run north. In 2009, the government of Uganda announced plans to construct a 750-megawatt hydropower project several kilometres north of the bridge, which was scheduled for completion in 2016. The World Bank had approved funding a smaller 200-megawatt power plant, but Uganda opted for a larger project, which the Ugandans will fund internally if necessary.

Just before entering Lake Albert, the river is compressed into a passage just seven meters wide at Murchison Falls, marking its entry into the western branch of the East African Rift. The river then flows into Lake Albert opposite the Blue Mountains in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The stretch of river from Lake Kyoga to Lake Albert is sometimes called the &quot;Kyoga Nile&quot;.

==== Albert Nile ====

The river draining from Lake Albert to the north is called the &quot;Albert Nile&quot;. It separates the West Nile sub-region of Uganda from the rest of the country. A bridge passes over the Albert Nile near its inlet in Nebbi District, but no other bridge over this section has been built. A ferry connects the roads between Adjumani and Moyo, and navigation of the river is otherwise done by small boat or canoe.

=== In South Sudan and Sudan ===
From the point at which the river enters South Sudan from Uganda, the river goes under the name of &quot;Mountain Nile&quot;. From Lake No in South Sudan the river becomes the &quot;White Nile&quot; in its strictest sense, and so continues northwards into Sudan where it ends at its confluence with the Blue Nile.

==== Mountain Nile ====

From Nimule in South Sudan, close to the border with Uganda, the river becomes known as the &quot;Mountain Nile&quot; or &quot;Baḥr al-Jabal&quot; (also &quot;Baḥr el-Jebel&quot;, ), literally Mountain River&quot; or &quot;River of the Mountain&quot;. The Southern Sudanese state of Central Equatoria through which the river flows was known as &quot;Bahr al-Jabal&quot; until 2006.

The southern stretch of the river encounters several rapids before reaching the Sudan plain and the vast swamp of the Sudd. It makes its way to Lake No, where it merges with the Bahr el Ghazal and there forms the White Nile. An anabranch river called Bahr el Zeraf flows out of the Bahr al-Jabal at and flows through the Sudd, to eventually join the White Nile. The Mountain Nile cascades through narrow gorges and over a series of rapids that includes the Fula (Fola) Rapids.

==== White Nile proper ====
To some people, the White Nile starts at the confluence of the Mountain Nile with the Bahr el Ghazal at Lake No.

The 120 kilometers of White Nile that flow east from Lake No to the mouth of the Sobat are very gently sloping and hold many swamps and lagoons. When in flood, the Sobat River tributary carries a large amount of sediment, adding greatly to the White Nile&#x27;s pale color. From South Sudan&#x27;s second city Malakal, the river runs slowly but swamp-free into Sudan and north to Khartoum. Downstream from Malakal lies Kodok, the site of the 1898 Fashoda Incident that marked an end to the Scramble for Africa.

In Sudan the river lends its name to the Sudanese state of White Nile, before merging with the larger Blue Nile at Khartoum and forming the River Nile.

== Inland waterways==
The White Nile is a navigable waterway from the Lake Albert to Khartoum through Jebel Aulia Dam, only between Juba and Uganda requires the river upgrade or channel to make it navigable.

During part of the year the rivers are navigable up to Gambela, Ethiopia, and Wau, South Sudan.

<text>Francisque Sarcey (8 October 1827 – 16 May 1899) was a French journalist and dramatic critic.

==Career==
Sarcey was born in Dourdan, Essonne. After some years as schoolmaster, a job for which his temperament was ill-fitted, he entered journalism in 1858. He contributed to &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Illustration&quot;, &quot;Le Gaulois&quot;, &quot;Le XIXe Siècle&quot; and other periodicals; but his main interest was dramatic criticism, of which he had his first experience in &quot;L&#x27;Opinion nationale&quot; in 1859. In 1867 he began to contribute to &quot;Le Temps&quot; the &quot;feuilleton&quot; with which his name was associated till his death. His position as dictator of dramatic criticism was said to be unique. He had the secret of taking the public into his confidence, and his pronouncements upon new plays were accepted as final.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, he was a masterly judge of acting and of stage effect; his views as to the drama itself were narrow and indifferent to artistic progress. For example, in 1896, he reviewed the premiere of Alfred Jarry&#x27;s play &quot;Ubu Roi&quot;—a precursor of the Theatre of the Absurd—and called it &quot;a filthy fraud which deserves nothing but the silence of contempt.&quot; Such opinions made him a subject of ridicule among the rebellious young artists and writers of Montmartre. Between 1886 and 1893, the writer and humorist Alphonse Allais published a notorious series of newspaper columns under Sarcey&#x27;s name with titles such as &quot;How I Became an Idiot.&quot;

Sarcey published several miscellaneous works, of which the most interesting are &quot;Le Siège de Paris&quot;, an account compiled from his diary (1871), &quot;Comédiens et comédiennes&quot; (1878-1884), &quot;Souvenirs de jeunesse&quot; (1884) and &quot;Souvenirs d&#x27;âge mûr&quot; (1892; Eng. trans., 1893). &quot;Quarante ans de théâtre&quot; (1900) is a selection (in 8 volumes) from his dramatic &quot;Feuilletons&quot; edited by Adolphe Brisson. He died in Paris.

==Vegetarianism==

Sarcey gave up eating meat in 1893 and described himself as a &quot;moderate vegetarian&quot; (what would now be described as pescatarian). He abstained from meat but ate butter, cheese, eggs, milk and fish. He argued that the diet gave him great resistance to fatigue and improved his health.

<doc id="199889" wikidata="Q674393" url="?curid=199889" title="Paul-Armand Challemel-Lacour">
<text>Paul-Armand Challemel-Lacour (; 19 May 1827 – 26 October 1896) was a French statesman.

==Biography==
Paul-Armand Challemel-Lacour was born in Avranches in the Manche &quot;département&quot; of northwestern France. After passing through the École Normale Supérieure he became professor of philosophy successively at Pau and at Limoges. The &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 1851 by Napoleon III caused his expulsion from France for his republican opinions. He travelled on the continent, gave conferences in Belgium and in 1856 settled down as professor of French literature at the Federal Polytechnic Institute Zurich, today the ETH Zurich. The amnesty of 1859 enabled him to return to France, but a projected course of lectures on history and art was immediately suppressed. He now supported himself by his pen, and became a regular contributor to the reviews.

On the fall of the Second French Empire in September 1870 the government of national defence appointed him prefect of the Rhône &quot;département&quot;, in which capacity he had to suppress the Communist rising at Lyon. Resigning his post on the 5 February 1871, he was in January 1872 elected to the National Assembly, and in 1876 to the Senate. He sat at first on the Extreme Left; but his philosophic and critical temperament was not in harmony with extreme French radicalism, and his attitude towards political questions underwent a steady modification, till the close of his life saw him the foremost representative of moderate republicanism.

During Léon Gambetta&#x27;s lifetime, however, Challemel-Lacour was one of his warmest supporters, and he was for a time editor of Gambetta&#x27;s organ, the &quot;République française&quot;. In 1879 he was appointed French ambassador at Bern, and in 1880 was transferred to London; but he lacked the temperament of a successful diplomat. He resigned in 1882, and in February 1883 became minister of foreign affairs in the Jules Ferry cabinet, but retired in November of the same year.

In 1890 he was elected vice-president of the Senate, and in 1893 succeeded Jules Ferry as its president, a position he held from 27 March 1893 to 16 January 1896. His clear and reasoned eloquence placed him at the head of contemporary French orators. In 1893 he also became a member of the Académie française. He distinguished himself by the vigour with which he upheld the Senate against the encroachments of the chamber, but in 1896 failing health forced him to resign, and he died in Paris.

==Works==
He published a translation of A Heinrich Ritter&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte der Philosophie&quot; (1861); &quot;La Philosophie individualiste: étude sur Guillaume de Humboldt&quot; (1864); and an edition of the works of Madame d&#x27;Epinay (1869).

In 1897 appeared Joseph Reinach&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Œuvres oratoires de Challemel-Lacour&quot;.

<text>Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington, 2nd Earl of Cork (20 October 1612 – 15 January 1698) was an Anglo-Irish nobleman who served as Lord High Treasurer of Ireland and was a Cavalier.

==Early life==

He was born at &quot;The College&quot; in Youghal in the south-east of County Cork, Ireland, as the sixth child and second son of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork and his second wife, Catherine Fenton, daughter of Sir Geoffrey Fenton. His brother was the chemist Robert Boyle, and his sister was Lady Ranelagh. On 13 August 1624, The Hon. Richard Boyle, Jr., was knighted at his father&#x27;s house in Youghal by Lord Falkland, the Lord Deputy of Ireland. As the Hon. Sir Richard Boyle, he then went on travels abroad with an annual allowance of £1500.

==Civil War==
In 1639, the young Sir Richard undertook to raise, arm, and provide 100 horses to attend upon King Charles I of England in his expedition into the North of England against the Scots. For this and other occasions, his father, Lord Cork, supplied him with £5553 sterling. Sir Richard Boyle was returned as Member of Parliament for Appleby in the Long Parliament of 1640, and appointed a member of the Privy Council of England, but was subsequently excluded for his Royalist sympathies after the outbreak of the English Civil War.

He and Lord Inchiquin commanded the forces which defeated the Irish irregular army at the Battle of Liscarroll on 3 September 1642, thereby preserving the Protestant interest in southern Ireland for the remainder of the decade. A cessation of hostilities was concluded with the Irish a year later (15 September 1643). He then applied to the King, in December, for consent to bring his regiment to serve him in England, and landed his men near Chester the following February. He then marched to the King&#x27;s aid in Dorset, supplying this monarch with large sums of money for his cause.

He fought throughout the Civil War until the final defeat of the Royalist forces. The Commonwealth fined him £1631 sterling and he then went abroad, returning to Ireland at the request of the government, dated 2 January 1651.

==Peerages and appointments==

Upon the death of his brother, Lord Boyle of Kinalmeaky, on 2 September 1642, Richard Boyle succeeded as 2nd Viscount Boyle of Kinalmeaky. A year later, he succeeded as the 2nd Earl of Cork upon the death of his father on 15 September 1643. Further, King Charles I created him Baron Clifford of Londesborough in the County of York on 4 November 1644. 

Following the Restoration, Richard was appointed a Privy Counsellor and Lord Treasurer of Ireland on 16 November 1660. On 22 February 1660, he was made Custos Rotulorum of County Cork and of Waterford, and on 19 March 1660, he was appointed one of the Commissioners for the settlement of Ireland following the King&#x27;s declaration to that effect on 30 November 1659. On 25 June 1661, he took his seat above all the peers, as Lord Treasurer, in the Irish House of Lords in the Irish Parliament. 

King Charles II of England created him Earl of Burlington on 20 March 1664, and on 13 March 1666, Richard was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Yorkshire.

In 1667, Richard purchased Burlington House in an incomplete state and proceeded to complete its construction. The house was the largest structure on his Burlington Estate and its name was derived from him.

Lord Burlington (as he was usually known for short from 1664 onwards), along with several other noblemen and Bishops of the Church of Ireland, were opposed to the attempts of King James II of England in regard to the restoration of Roman Catholicism and petitioned the King on 17 November 1688 to call a parliament &quot;regular and free in all its circumstances&quot;. This petition had a hostile reception from King James. Following the arrival of William of Orange in England, King James removed to Ireland where he called a parliament in 1689, which passed an act of attainder against certain Protestants deemed disloyal to the king, and confiscated their estates, among whom was the Earl of Burlington (who was also Earl of Cork). This was overturned the following year by William of Orange when he ascended the throne.

On 3 March 1691, Richard was appointed to the newly incorporated Society of the Royal Fishery in Ireland.

==Family and death==

At the age of 22, Richard Boyle married the 21-year-old Lady Elizabeth Clifford, daughter of Henry Clifford, 5th Earl of Cumberland and Lady Frances Cecil, on 5 July 1635 at Skipton Castle. They had six children:
* Charles Boyle, 3rd Viscount Dungarvan (1639–1694).
* Richard Boyle, who died on 3 June 1665 at the Battle of Lowestoft.
* Frances Boyle (born March 1636, died 1674 or earlier), who married firstly Colonel Francis Courtenay and secondly Wentworth Dillon, 4th Earl of Roscommon.
* Elizabeth Boyle, who married Nicholas Tufton, 3rd Earl of Thanet.
* Mary Anne Boyle, who married Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Sandwich.
* Henrietta Boyle, who married Lawrence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester.

Lord Burlington died on 6 January 1698 and was buried on 3 February 1698 at Londesborough in Yorkshire. He was succeeded by his grandson, Charles Boyle, 2nd Earl of Burlington.

<text>Elme Marie Caro (4 March 1826, Poitiers, Vienne13 July 1887, Paris) was a French philosopher.

==Life==
His father, a professor of philosophy, gave him an education at the Stanislas College and the École Normale, where he graduated in 1848. After being professor of philosophy at several provincial universities, he received the degree of doctor in 1852 on the subject of Louis Claude de Saint-Martin, and came to Paris in 1858 as master of conferences at the École Normale.

In 1861 he became inspector of the Academy of Paris, in 1864 professor of philosophy to the Faculty of Letters, and in 1874 a member of the Académie Française. He married Pauline Cassin, the author of &quot;Le Péché de Madeleine&quot; and other well-known novels.

In his philosophy, he was mainly concerned to defend Christianity against modern Positivism. The philosophy of Victor Cousin influenced him strongly, but his strength lay in exposition and criticism rather than in original thought.

He wrote important contributions to &quot;La France&quot; and the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot;.

<doc id="199894" wikidata="Q1368272" url="?curid=199894" title="Louis Hachette">
<text>Louis Christophe François Hachette (; 5 May 1800 – 31 July 1864) was a French publisher who established a Paris publishing house designed to produce books and other material to improve the system of school instruction. Publications were initially focused on the classics and subsequently expanded to include books and magazines of all types. The firm is currently part of a global publishing house.

== Early life ==
Hachette was born on 5 May 1800 at Rethel in the Ardennes &quot;département&quot; of France. He was a son of Jean Hachette (1775–1840) and Marie Ledouble (1781–1862). 

After studying for three years at the prestigious École Normale Supérieure with the intention of becoming a teacher, in 1822 he was expelled, on political grounds. In 1826, after briefly studying law, Hachette opened Brédif, a bookshop located near the Sorbonne in Paris. The focus of the business was to produce works designed to improve the system of school instruction and to promote general culture in the community. He published manuals on various topics including dictionaries of modern and ancient languages, educational journals, and French, Latin and Greek classics annotated by the most eminent authorities.

== Milestones ==
In 1833, the Guizot Schools Law was passed which required all municipalities to open a primary school. Louis Hachette had been putting together an alphabet primer since 1829 and his was the only company capable of responding to the public order for a million textbooks.

In 1846, the L. Hachette &amp; Company was founded. That year, Emile Littré signed a contract with the new firm to publish a dictionary, the first volumes of which appear in 1863. In 1852, Hachette contracted with seven railway companies to create station bookstalls. In addition to travel guides for rail passengers, the small outlets sold novels by authors including Charles Dickens, Gérard de Nerval, George Sand and the children’s series Bibliothèque Rose, including those by La Comtesse de Ségur.

In 1855 Hachette founded &quot;Le Journal pour tous&quot;, a publication with a circulation of 150,000 weekly. He started printing &quot;Le Tour du Monde&quot;, a weekly travel journal, in January 1860.

Hachette also manifested great interest in the formation of mutual friendly societies among the working classes, in the establishment of benevolent institutions, and in other questions relating to the amelioration of the poor, a subject on which he wrote various pamphlets. He also lent the weight of his influence towards a just settlement of issues relating to international literary copyright.

==Personal life==
Hachette was married twice, first to &quot;Amélie&quot; Catherine Marie Agathe Barbedienne (1803–1832) on 17 February 1827 in Paris. Before her death, they were the parents of:

* Marie-Joséphine Hachette (1828–1831), who died young.
* Louise Agathe Hachette (1829–1900), who married Emile François Templier in 1849.
* Alfred Louis Hachette (1832–1872), who married Marie Aumont in 1861.

After Amelie died in 1832, he married Pauline ( Royer) Auzat (1804–1872), the widow of Édouard Jean Maurice Auzat, on 29 January 1836 in Paris. Before his death, they were the parents of a son:

* George-Jean Hachette (1832–1892), who married Marie Teyssier in 1868.

Hachette died in Paris on 31 July 1864.

<text>USS &quot;Lexington&quot; (CV-2), nicknamed &quot;Lady Lex&quot;, was the name ship of her class of two aircraft carriers built for the United States Navy during the 1920s. Originally designed as a , she was converted into one of the Navy&#x27;s first aircraft carriers during construction to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, which essentially terminated all new battleship and battlecruiser construction. The ship entered service in 1928 and was assigned to the Pacific Fleet for her entire career. &quot;Lexington&quot; and her sister ship, , were used to develop and refine carrier tactics in a series of annual exercises before World War II. On more than one occasion these included successfully staged surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The ship&#x27;s turbo-electric propulsion system allowed her to supplement the electrical supply of Tacoma, Washington, during a drought in late 1929 to early 1930. She also delivered medical personnel and relief supplies to Managua, Nicaragua, after an earthquake in 1931.

&quot;Lexington&quot; was at sea when the Pacific War began on 7 December 1941, ferrying fighter aircraft to Midway Island. Her mission was canceled and she returned to Pearl Harbor a week later. After a few days, she was sent to create a diversion from the force en route to relieve the besieged Wake Island garrison by attacking Japanese installations in the Marshall Islands. The island surrendered before the relief force got close enough, and the mission was canceled. A planned attack on Wake Island in January 1942 had to be canceled when a submarine sank the oiler required to supply the fuel for the return trip. &quot;Lexington&quot; was sent to the Coral Sea the following month to block any Japanese advances into the area. The ship was spotted by Japanese search aircraft while approaching Rabaul, New Britain, but her aircraft shot down most of the Japanese bombers that attacked her. Together with the carrier , she successfully attacked Japanese shipping off the east coast of New Guinea in early March.

&quot;Lexington&quot; was quickly refitted in Pearl Harbor at the end of the month and rendezvoused with &quot;Yorktown&quot; in the Coral Sea in early May. A few days later the Japanese began Operation Mo, the invasion of Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, and the two American carriers attempted to stop the invasion forces. They sank the light aircraft carrier on 7 May during the Battle of the Coral Sea, but did not encounter the main Japanese force of the carriers and until the next day. Aircraft from &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; badly damaged &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, but the Japanese aircraft crippled &quot;Lexington&quot;. A mixture of air and aviation gasoline in her improperly drained aircraft fueling trunk lines (which ran from the keel tanks to her hangar deck) ignited, causing a series of explosions and fires that could not be controlled. &quot;Lexington&quot; was scuttled by an American destroyer during the evening of 8 May to prevent her capture. The ship&#x27;s wreck was located on 4 March 2018 by , which was part of an expedition funded by Paul Allen.

==Description and construction==
&quot;Lexington&quot; was the fourth US Navy ship named after the 1775 Battle of Lexington, the first battle of the Revolutionary War. She was originally authorized in 1916 as a , but construction was delayed so that higher-priority anti-submarine vessels and merchant ships, needed to ensure the safe passage of personnel and materiel to Europe during Germany&#x27;s U-boat campaign, could be built. After the war the ship was extensively redesigned, partially as a result of British experience. Given the hull number of CC-1, &quot;Lexington&quot; was laid down on 8 January 1921 by Fore River Shipbuilding Company of Quincy, Massachusetts.

Before the Washington Naval Conference concluded, the ship&#x27;s construction was suspended in February 1922, when she was 24.2 percent complete. She was re-designated and re-authorized as an aircraft carrier on 1 July 1922. Her displacement was reduced by a total of , achieved mainly by the elimination of her main armament of eight 16-inch (406 mm) guns in four twin turrets (including their heavy turret mounts, their armor, and other equipment). The main armor belt was retained, but was reduced in height to save weight. The general line of the hull remained unaltered, as did the torpedo protection system, because they had already been built, and it would have been too expensive to alter them.

The ship had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of at deep load. &quot;Lexington&quot; had a standard displacement of and at deep load. At that displacement, she had a metacentric height of .

Christened by Helen Rebecca Roosevelt, the wife of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Theodore Douglas Robinson, &quot;Lexington&quot; was launched on 3 October 1925. She was commissioned on 14 December 1927 with Captain Albert Marshall in command. By 1942, the ship had a crew of 100 officers and 1,840 enlisted men and an aviation group totaling 141 officers and 710 enlisted men.

===Flight deck arrangements===

The ship&#x27;s flight deck was long and had a maximum width of . When built, her hangar &quot;was the largest single enclosed space afloat on any ship&quot; and had an area of . It was long and wide. Its minimum height was , and it was divided by a single fire curtain just forward of the aft aircraft elevator. Aircraft repair shops, long, were aft of the hangar, and below them was a storage space for disassembled aircraft, long. &quot;Lexington&quot; was fitted with two hydraulically powered elevators on her centerline. The forward elevator&#x27;s dimensions were and it had a capacity of . The aft elevator had a capacity of only and measured . Avgas was stored in eight compartments of the torpedo protection system, and their capacity has been quoted as either or .
&quot;Lexington&quot; was initially fitted with electrically operated arresting gear designed by Carl Norden that used both fore-and-aft and transverse wires. The longitudinal wires were intended to prevent aircraft from being blown over the side of the ship while the transverse wires slowed them to a stop. This system was authorized to be replaced by the hydraulically operated Mk 2 system, without longitudinal wires, on 11 August 1931. Four improved Mk 3 units were added in 1934, giving the ship a total of eight arresting wires and four barriers intended to prevent aircraft from crashing into parked aircraft on the ship&#x27;s bow. After the forward flight deck was widened in 1936, an additional eight wires were added there to allow aircraft to land over the bow if the landing area at the stern was damaged. The ship was built with a , flywheel-powered, F Mk II aircraft catapult, also designed by Norden, on the starboard side of the bow. This catapult was strong enough to launch a aircraft at a speed of . It was intended to launch seaplanes, but was rarely used; a 1931 report tallied only five launches of practice loads since the ship had been commissioned. It was removed during the ship&#x27;s 1936 refit.

&quot;Lexington&quot; was designed to carry 78 aircraft, including 36 bombers, but these numbers increased once the Navy adopted the practice of tying up spare aircraft in the unused spaces at the top of the hangar. In 1936, the fighter component of her air group consisted of 18 Grumman F2F-1 and 18 Boeing F4B-4 fighters, plus an additional nine F2Fs in reserve. Offensive punch was provided by 20 Vought SBU Corsair dive bombers with 10 spare aircraft and 18 Great Lakes BG torpedo bombers with nine spares. Miscellaneous aircraft included two Grumman JF Duck amphibians, plus one in reserve, and three active and one spare Vought O2U Corsair observation aircraft. This amounted to 79 aircraft, plus 30 spares.

===Propulsion===
The &quot;Lexington&quot;-class carriers used turbo-electric propulsion; each of the four propeller shafts was driven by two electric motors. They were powered by four General Electric turbo generators rated at using steam provided by sixteen Yarrow boilers. Six electric generators were installed in the upper levels of the two main turbine compartments to provide power to meet the ship&#x27;s hotel load (minimum electrical) requirements.

The ship was designed to reach , but &quot;Lexington&quot; achieved from during sea trials in 1928. She carried a maximum of of fuel oil, but only of that was usable, as the rest had to be retained as ballast in the port fuel tanks to offset the weight of the island and main guns. Designed for a range of at a speed of , the ship demonstrated a range of at a speed of with of oil.

===Armament===

The Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Construction and Repair was not convinced when the class was being designed that aircraft could effectively substitute as armament for a warship, especially at night or in bad weather that would prevent air operations. Thus the carriers&#x27; design included a substantial gun battery of 8 Mk 9 guns in four twin-gun turrets. These turrets were mounted above the flight deck on the starboard side, one superfiring pair before the superstructure, and another behind the funnel, numbered I to IV from bow to stern. In theory the guns could fire to both sides, but it is probable that if they were fired to port (across the deck) the blast would have damaged the flight deck.

The ship&#x27;s heavy anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of a dozen Mk 10 guns which were mounted on single mounts, three each fitted on sponsons on each side of the bow and stern. No light AA guns were initially mounted on &quot;Lexington&quot;, but two sextuple .30-caliber (7.62 mm) machine gun mounts were installed in 1929. They were unsuccessful, and they were replaced by two .50-caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns by 1931, one each on the roof of the upper eight-inch turrets. During a refit in 1935, platforms mounting four .50-caliber machine guns were installed on each corner of the ship, and an additional platform was installed that wrapped around the funnel. Six machine guns were mounted on each side of this last platform. In October 1940, four Mk 10 AA guns were installed in the corner platforms; they replaced two of the .50-caliber machine guns which were remounted on the tops of the eight-inch gun turrets. Another three-inch gun was added on the roof of the deckhouse between the funnel and the island. These guns were just interim weapons until the quadruple  gun mounts could be installed in August 1941.

In March 1942, &quot;Lexington&quot;″s eight-inch turrets were removed at Pearl Harbor and replaced by seven quadruple 1.1-inch gun mounts. The eight-inch guns and turrets were reused as coast defense weapons on Oahu. In addition twenty-two Oerlikon AA guns were installed, six in a new platform at the base of the funnel, 12 in the positions formerly occupied by the ship&#x27;s boats in the sides of the hull, two at the stern, and a pair on the aft control top. When the ship was sunk in May 1942, her armament consisted of a dozen single 5-inch guns, 12 quadruple 1.1-inch mounts, 22 Oerlikon guns, and at least two dozen .50-caliber machine guns.

===Fire control and electronics===
Each eight-inch turret had a Mk 30 rangefinder at the rear of the turret for local control, but they were normally controlled by two Mk 18 fire-control directors, one each on the fore and aft spotting tops. A rangefinder was fitted on top of the pilothouse to provide range information for the directors. Each group of three five-inch guns was controlled by a Mk 19 director, two of which were mounted on each side of the spotting tops. &quot;Lexington&quot; received a RCA CXAM-1 radar in June 1941 during a brief refit in Pearl Harbor. The antenna was mounted on the forward lip of the funnel with its control room directly below the aerial, replacing the secondary conning station formerly mounted there.

===Armor===
The waterline belt of the &quot;Lexington&quot;-class ships tapered in thickness from top to bottom and angled 11° outwards at the top. It covered the middle of the ships. Forward, the belt ended in a bulkhead that also tapered from seven to five inches in thickness. Aft, it terminated at a seven-inch bulkhead. This belt had a height of . The third deck over the ships&#x27; machinery and magazine was armored with two layers of special treatment steel (STS) totaling in thickness. The steering gear, however, was protected by two layers of STS that totaled on the flat and on the slope.

The gun turrets were protected only against splinters with of armor. The conning tower was of STS, and it had a communications tube with two-inch sides running from the conning tower down to the lower conning position on the third deck. The torpedo defense system of the &quot;Lexington&quot;-class ships consisted of three to six medium steel protective bulkheads that ranged from in thickness. The spaces between them could be used as fuel tanks or left empty to absorb the detonation of a torpedo&#x27;s warhead.

==Service history==

After fitting-out and shakedown cruises, &quot;Lexington&quot; was transferred to the West Coast of the United States and arrived at San Pedro, California, part of Los Angeles, on 7 April 1928. In June &quot;Lexington&quot; made a high speed run from San Pedro to Honolulu in the record time of 72 hours and 34 minutes. &quot;Lexington&quot; was based in San Pedro until 1940 and mainly stayed on the West Coast, although she did participate in several Fleet Problems (training exercises) in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. These exercises tested the Navy&#x27;s evolving doctrine and tactics for the use of carriers. During Fleet Problem IX in January 1929, &quot;Lexington&quot; and the Scouting Force failed to defend the Panama Canal against an aerial attack launched by her sister ship . Future science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein reported aboard on 6 July as a newly minted ensign under Captain Frank Berrien. Heinlein experienced his first literary rejection when his short story about a case of espionage discovered at the Naval Academy failed to win a shipboard writing contest.
In 1929, western Washington state suffered a drought which resulted in low levels in Lake Cushman that provided water for Cushman Dam No. 1. The hydro-electric power generated by this dam was the primary source for the city of Tacoma and the city requested help from the federal government once the water in the lake receded below the dam&#x27;s intakes during December. The U.S. Navy sent &quot;Lexington&quot;, which had been at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, to Tacoma, and heavy electric lines were rigged into the city&#x27;s power system. The ship&#x27;s generators provided a total of 4,520,960 kilowatt hours from 17 December to 16 January 1930 until melting snow and rain brought the reservoirs up to the level needed to generate sufficient power for the city. Two months later, she participated in Fleet Problem X, which was conducted in the Caribbean. During the exercise, her aircraft were judged to have destroyed the flight decks and all the aircraft of the opposing carriers &quot;Saratoga&quot; and . Fleet Problem XI was held the following month and &quot;Saratoga&quot; returned the favor, knocking out &quot;Lexington&quot;″s flight deck for 24 hours, just as the exercise came to a climax with a major surface engagement.

Captain Ernest J. King, who later rose to serve as the Chief of Naval Operations during World War II, assumed command on 20 June 1930. &quot;Lexington&quot; was assigned, together with &quot;Saratoga&quot;, to defend the west coast of Panama against a hypothetical invader during Fleet Problem XII in February 1931. While each carrier was able to inflict some damage on the invasion convoys, the enemy forces succeeded in making a landing. Shortly afterward, all three carriers transferred to the Caribbean to conduct further maneuvers. The most important of these was when &quot;Saratoga&quot; successfully defended the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal from an attack by &quot;Lexington&quot;. Rear Admiral Joseph M. Reeves baited a trap for King with a destroyer and scored a kill on &quot;Lexington&quot; on 22 March while the latter&#x27;s aircraft were still searching for &quot;Saratoga&quot;.
On 31 March 1931, &quot;Lexington&quot;, which had been near Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, was ordered to aid survivors of an earthquake that devastated Managua, Nicaragua. By the following day, the ship was close enough to launch aircraft carrying supplies and medical personnel to Managua.

During Grand Joint Exercise No. 4, &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; were able to launch a massive airstrike against Pearl Harbor on Sunday, 7 February 1932 without being detected. The two carriers were separated for Fleet Problem XIII, which followed shortly afterward. &quot;Lexington&quot; was assigned to Black Fleet, defending Hawaii and the West Coast against Blue Fleet and &quot;Saratoga&quot;. On 15 March, &quot;Lexington&quot; caught &quot;Saratoga&quot; with all of her planes still on deck and was ruled to have knocked out her flight deck and have badly damaged the carrier, which was subsequently ruled sunk during a night attack by Black Fleet destroyers shortly afterward. &quot;Lexington&quot;″s aircraft were judged to have badly damaged two of Blue Fleet&#x27;s battleships.

Before Fleet Problem XIV began in February 1933, the Army and the Navy conducted a joint exercise simulating a carrier attack on Hawaii. &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; successfully attacked Pearl Harbor at dawn on 31 January without being detected. During the actual fleet problem, &quot;Lexington&quot; attempted to attack San Francisco, but was surprised in heavy fog by several defending battleships at close range and sunk.

Fleet Problem XV returned to the Gulf of Panama and the Caribbean in April–May 1934, but the participating ships of the Pacific Fleet remained in the Caribbean and off the East Coast for more training and maneuvers until they returned to their home bases in November. Most notably during Fleet Problem XVI, April–June 1935, &quot;Lexington&quot; ran low on fuel after five days of high-speed steaming, and this led to experiments with underway replenishment that later proved essential to combat operations during the Pacific War. During Fleet Problem XVII in 1936, &quot;Lexington&quot; and the smaller carrier routinely refueled their plane guard destroyers.

Admiral Claude C. Bloch limited &quot;Lexington&quot; to support of the battleships during Fleet Problem XVIII in 1937 and consequently the carrier was crippled and nearly sunk by surface gunfire and torpedoes. The following July, the ship participated in the unsuccessful search for Amelia Earhart. The 1938 Fleet Problem again tested the defenses of Hawaii and, again, aircraft from &quot;Lexington&quot; and her sister successfully attacked Pearl Harbor at dawn on 29 March. Later in the exercise, the two carriers successfully attacked San Francisco without being spotted by the defending fleet. Fleet Problem XX, held in the Caribbean in March–April 1939, was the only time before October 1943 that the Navy concentrated four carriers (&quot;Lexington&quot;, &quot;Ranger&quot;, &quot;Yorktown&quot;, and ) together for maneuvers. This exercise also saw the first attempts to refuel carriers and battleships at sea. During Fleet Problem XXI in 1940, &quot;Lexington&quot; caught &quot;Yorktown&quot; by surprise and crippled her, although &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s aircraft managed to knock out &quot;Lexington&quot;″s flight deck. The fleet was ordered to remain in Hawaii after the conclusion of the exercise in May.

===World War II===
Admiral Husband Kimmel, Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, ordered Task Force (TF) 12—&quot;Lexington&quot;, three heavy cruisers and five destroyers—to depart Pearl Harbor on 5 December 1941 to ferry 18 U.S. Marine Corps Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers of VMSB-231 to reinforce the base at Midway Island. At this time she embarked 65 of her own aircraft, including 17 Brewster F2A Buffalo fighters. On the morning of 7 December, the task force was about southeast of Midway when it received news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Several hours later, Rear Admiral John H. Newton, commander of the task force, received orders that canceled the ferry mission and ordered him to search for the Japanese ships while rendezvousing with Vice Admiral Wilson Brown&#x27;s ships west of Niihau Island. Captain Frederick Sherman needed to maintain a continuous Combat Air Patrol (CAP) and recover the fuel-starved fighters which were on patrol. With the Marine aircraft aboard, &quot;Lexington&quot;″s flight deck was very congested and he decided to reverse the phase of the ship&#x27;s electric propulsion motors and steam full speed astern in order to launch a new CAP and then swap back to resume forward motion to recover his current CAP. This unorthodox action allowed him to maintain a continuous CAP and recover his aircraft without the lengthy delay caused by moving the aircraft on the flight deck from the bow to the stern and back to make space available for launch and recovery operations. &quot;Lexington&quot; launched several scout planes to search for the Japanese that day and remained at sea between Johnston Island and Hawaii, reacting to several false alerts, until she returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 December. Kimmel had wanted to keep the ships at sea for longer, but difficulties refueling at sea on 11 and 12 December meant that the task force was low on fuel and was forced to return to port.

Redesignated as Task Force 11 and reinforced by four destroyers, &quot;Lexington&quot; and her consorts steamed from Pearl Harbor the next day to raid the Japanese base on Jaluit in the Marshall Islands to distract the Japanese from the Wake Island relief force led by &quot;Saratoga&quot;. For this operation, &quot;Lexington&quot; embarked 21 Buffalos, 32 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, and 15 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers, although not all aircraft were operational. Vice Admiral William S. Pye, acting commander of the Pacific Fleet, canceled the attack on 20 December and ordered the task force northwest to cover the relief force. The Japanese, however, captured Wake on 23 December before &quot;Saratoga&quot; and her consorts could get there. Pye, reluctant to risk any carriers against a Japanese force of unknown strength, ordered both task forces to return to Pearl.

&quot;Lexington&quot; arrived back at Pearl Harbor on 27 December, but was ordered back to sea two days later. She returned on 3 January, needing repairs to one of her main generators. It was repaired four days later when TF 11 sailed with the carrier as Brown&#x27;s flagship. The Task Force&#x27;s mission was to patrol in the direction of Johnston Atoll. It was spotted by the submarine &quot;I-18&quot; on 9 January and several other submarines were vectored to intercept the task force. Another submarine was spotted on the surface the following morning about south of the carrier by two Buffalos who reported it without alerting the submarine to their presence. That afternoon it was spotted again, further south, by a different pair of fighters, and two Devastators carrying depth charges were vectored to the submarine&#x27;s position. They claimed to have damaged it before it could fully submerge, but the incident is not mentioned in Japanese records. The putative victim was most likely , which arrived at Kwajalein Atoll on 15 January. &quot;Lexington&quot; and her consorts returned to Pearl Harbor on the following day without further incident.

Task Force 11 sailed from Pearl Harbor three days later to conduct patrols northeast of Christmas Island. On 21 January, Admiral Chester Nimitz, the new commander of the Pacific Fleet, ordered Brown to conduct a diversionary raid on Wake Island on 27 January after refueling from the only available tanker, the elderly and slow oiler en route to Brown. The unescorted tanker was torpedoed and sunk by &quot;I-71&quot; 23 January, forcing the cancellation of the raid. The task force arrived back in Pearl two days later. Brown was ordered back to sea on 31 January to escort the fast oiler to its rendezvous with Halsey&#x27;s task force returning from its attack on Japanese bases in the Marshall Islands. He was then supposed to patrol near Canton Island to cover a convoy arriving there on 12 February. The task force was reconfigured with only two heavy cruisers and seven destroyers; the 18 Grumman F4F Wildcats of VF-3, redeployed from the torpedoed &quot;Saratoga&quot;, replaced VF-2 to allow the latter unit to convert to the Wildcat. One of the Wildcats was severely damaged upon landing on the carrier. Nimitz canceled the rendezvous on 2 February after it became apparent that Halsey did not need &quot;Neosho&quot;″s fuel and ordered Brown to proceed to Canton Island. On 6 February, Nimitz ordered him to rendezvous with the ANZAC Squadron in the Coral Sea to prevent Japanese advances that might interfere with the sea lanes connecting Australia and the United States. In addition, he was to protect a troop convoy bound for New Caledonia.

====Attempted raid on Rabaul====

The heavy cruiser and two destroyers reinforced the task force on 10 February and Brown rendezvoused with the ANZAC Squadron six days later. Even after emptying &quot;Neosho&quot; of her oil, there was not enough fuel for the ANZAC Squadron to join Brown&#x27;s proposed raid on Rabaul and they were forced to remain behind. Brown was reinforced by the heavy cruiser and two destroyers on 17 February and tasked these ships to bombard Rabaul in addition to the attack by &quot;Lexington&quot;″s aircraft. While still some northeast of Rabaul, the task force was spotted by a Kawanishi H6K &quot;Mavis&quot; flying boat on the morning of 20 February. The snooper was detected by &quot;Lexington&quot;″s radar and was shot down by Lieutenant Commander Jimmy Thach and his wingman, but not before it radioed its spot report. Another H6K was vectored in to confirm the first aircraft&#x27;s report, but it was detected and shot down before it could radio its report. Brown&#x27;s plan had depended on the element of surprise and he canceled the raid, although he decided to proceed toward Rabaul to lure Japanese aircraft into attacking him.
Rear Admiral Eiji Gotō, commander of the 24th Air Flotilla, launched all 17 of his long-range Mitsubishi G4M1 &quot;Betty&quot; torpedo bombers of the recently activated 4th Kōkūtai, although no torpedoes were available at Rabaul and they made do with a pair of bombs apiece. To better search for the Americans, the Japanese split their aircraft into two groups and &quot;Lexington&quot;″s radar acquired one of these at 16:25. At this time, the ship was rotating its patrolling aircraft and the newly launched aircraft barely had time to reach the altitude of the Japanese before they arrived. &quot;Lexington&quot; had 15 fully fueled Wildcats and Dauntlesses on her forward flight deck that had been moved forward to allow the patrolling fighters to land. They represented a serious fire hazard, but they could not be launched until all aircraft on the flight deck were moved aft. Cognizant of the danger, the deck crews succeeded in respotting the aircraft, and the fueled aircraft were able to take off before the Japanese attacked. Commander Herbert Duckworth said, &quot;It was as if some great hand moved all the planes aft simultaneously.&quot; Only four of the nine G4Ms in the first wave survived to reach &quot;Lexington&quot;, but all of their bombs missed and they were all shot down afterward, including one by a Dauntless. The losses were not all one-sided as they shot down two of the defending Wildcats. The second wave of eight bombers was spotted at 16:56, while all but two of the Wildcats were dealing with the first wave. Lieutenant Edward O&#x27;Hare and his wingman, Lieutenant (junior grade) Marion Dufilho, were able to intercept the bombers a few miles short of &quot;Lexington&quot;, but Dufilho&#x27;s guns jammed before he could fire a shot. O&#x27;Hare shot down three G4Ms and damaged two others before the bombers dropped their bombs, none of which struck the wildly maneuvering carrier. Only three of the G4Ms reached base, as Wildcats and Dauntlesses pursued and shot down several others.

====Lae-Salamaua raid====
The task force changed course after dark for its rendezvous with the tanker , scheduled for 22 February. One Japanese Aichi E13A &quot;Jake&quot; floatplane succeeded in tracking the task force for a short time after dark, but six H6Ks launched after midnight were unable to locate the American ships. Brown rendezvoused with &quot;Platte&quot; and the escorting ANZAC Squadron on schedule and he requested reinforcement by another carrier if another raid on Rabaul was desired. Nimitz promptly responded by ordering &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s Task Force 17, under the command of Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, to rendezvous with Brown north of New Caledonia on 6 March to allow the latter to attack Rabaul. The initial plan was to attack from the south in the hope of avoiding Japanese search aircraft, but this was changed on 8 March when word was received that Rabaul harbor was empty, as the Japanese had invaded Papua New Guinea and all the shipping was anchored off the villages of Lae and Salamaua. The plan was changed to mount the attack from a position in the Gulf of Papua, even though this involved flying over the Owen Stanley Mountains. The two carriers reached their positions on the morning of 10 March. &quot;Lexington&quot; launched eight Wildcats, 31 Dauntlesses and 13 Devastators. They were the first to attack the 16 Japanese ships in the area and sank three transports and damaged several other ships before &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s aircraft arrived 15 minutes later. One Dauntless was shot down by anti-aircraft fire while a Wildcat shot down a Nakajima E8N floatplane. A H6K spotted one carrier later that afternoon, but the weather had turned bad and the 24th Air Flotilla decided not to attack. Task Force 11 was ordered to return to Pearl and &quot;Lexington&quot; exchanged six Wildcats, five Dauntlesses and one Devastator for two Wildcats from &quot;Yorktown&quot; that needed overhaul before she left. The task force arrived at Pearl Harbor on 26 March.

The ship was given a short refit, during which her eight-inch gun turrets were removed and replaced by quadruple 1.1-inch (28 mm) anti-aircraft guns. Rear Admiral Aubrey Fitch assumed command of Task Force 11 on 1 April and it was reorganized to consist of &quot;Lexington&quot; and the heavy cruisers and as well as seven destroyers. The task force sortied from Pearl Harbor on 15 April, carrying 14 Buffalos of VMF-211 to be flown off at Palmyra Atoll. After flying off the Marine fighters, the task force was ordered to train with the battleships of Task Force 1 in the vicinity of Palmyra and Christmas Island. Late on 18 April, the training was canceled, as Allied codebreakers had figured out that the Japanese intended to invade and occupy Port Moresby and Tulagi in the southeastern Solomon Islands (Operation Mo). Therefore, Fitch&#x27;s ships, acting on a command from Nimitz, rendezvoused with TF 17 north of New Caledonia on 1 May, after refueling from the tanker on 25 April to thwart the Japanese offensive. At this time, &quot;Lexington&quot;″s air group consisted of 21 Wildcats, 37 Dauntlesses and 12 Devastators.

====Battle of the Coral Sea====

=====Preliminary actions=====
Both task forces needed to refuel, but TF 17 finished first, and Fletcher took &quot;Yorktown&quot; and her consorts northward toward the Solomon Islands on 2 May. TF 11 was ordered to rendezvous with TF 17 and Task Force 44, the former ANZAC Squadron, further west into the Coral Sea on 4 May. The Japanese opened Operation Mo by occupying Tulagi on 3 May. Alerted by Allied reconnaissance aircraft, Fletcher decided to attack Japanese shipping there the following day. The air strike on Tulagi confirmed that at least one American carrier was in the vicinity, but the Japanese had no idea of its location. They launched reconnaissance aircraft the following day to search for the Americans, but without result. One H6K flying boat spotted &quot;Yorktown&quot;, but was shot down by one of &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s Wildcat fighters before she could radio a report. US Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraft spotted &quot;Shōhō&quot; southwest of Bougainville Island on 5 May, but she was too far north to be attacked by the American carriers, which were refueling. That day, Fletcher received Ultra intelligence that placed the three Japanese carriers known to be involved in Operation Mo near Bougainville Island, and predicted 10 May as the date of the invasion. It also predicted airstrikes by the Japanese carriers in support of the invasion several days before 10 May. Based on this information, Fletcher planned to complete refueling on 6 May and to move closer to the eastern tip of New Guinea to be in a position to locate and attack Japanese forces on 7 May.

Another H6K spotted the Americans during the morning of 6 May and successfully shadowed them until 1400. The Japanese, however, were unwilling or unable to launch air strikes in poor weather or without updated spot reports. Both sides believed they knew where the other force was, and expected to fight the next day. The Japanese were the first to spot their opponents when one aircraft found the oiler &quot;Neosho&quot; escorted by the destroyer at 0722, south of the strike force. They were misidentified as a carrier and a cruiser so the fleet carriers &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; launched an airstrike 40 minutes later that sank &quot;Sims&quot; and damaged &quot;Neosho&quot; badly enough that she had to be scuttled a few days later. The American carriers were west of the Japanese carriers, not south, and they were spotted by other Japanese aircraft shortly after the carriers had launched their attack on &quot;Neosho&quot; and &quot;Sims&quot;.

American reconnaissance aircraft reported two Japanese heavy cruisers northeast of Misima Island in the Louisiade Archipelago off the eastern tip of New Guinea at 07:35 and two carriers at 08:15. An hour later Fletcher ordered an airstrike launched, believing that the two carriers reported were &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot;. &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; launched a total of 53 Dauntlesses and 22 Devastators escorted by 18 Wildcats. The 08:15 report turned out to be miscoded, as the pilot had intended to report two heavy cruisers, but USAAF aircraft had spotted &quot;Shōhō&quot;, her escorts and the invasion convoy in the meantime. As the latest spot report plotted only away from the 08:15 report, the aircraft en route were diverted to this new target.
&quot;Shōhō&quot; and the rest of the main force were spotted by aircraft from &quot;Lexington&quot; at 10:40. At this time, &quot;Shōhō&quot;″s patrolling fighters consisted of two Mitsubishi A5M &quot;Claudes&quot; and one Mitsubishi A6M Zero. The dive bombers of VS-2 began their attack at 1110 as the three Japanese fighters attacked the Dauntlesses in their dive. None of the dive bombers hit &quot;Shōhō&quot;, which was maneuvering to avoid their bombs; one Zero shot down a Dauntless after it had pulled out of its dive; several other Dauntlesses were also damaged. The carrier launched three more Zeros immediately after this attack to reinforce its defenses. The Dauntlesses of VB-2 began their attack at 11:18 and they hit &quot;Shōhō&quot; twice with bombs. These penetrated the ship&#x27;s flight deck and burst inside her hangars, setting the fueled and armed aircraft there on fire. A minute later the Devastators of VT-2 began dropping their torpedoes from both sides of the ship. They hit &quot;Shōhō&quot; five times and the damage from the hits knocked out her steering and power. In addition, the hits flooded both the engine and boiler rooms. &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s aircraft finished the carrier off and she sank at 11:31. After his attack, Lieutenant Commander Robert E. Dixon, commander of VS-2, radioed his famous message to the American carriers: &quot;Scratch one flat top!&quot;

After &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; had recovered the aircraft that had sunk &quot;Neosho&quot; and &quot;Sims&quot;, Rear Admiral Chūichi Hara, commander of the 5th Carrier Division, ordered that a further air strike be readied as the American carriers were believed to have been located. The two carriers launched a total of 12 Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers and 15 Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers late that afternoon. The Japanese had mistaken Task Force 44 for &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot;, which were much closer than anticipated, although they were along the same bearing. &quot;Lexington&quot;″s radar spotted one group of nine B5Ns at 17:47 and half the airborne fighters were directed to intercept them while additional Wildcats were launched to reinforce the defenses. The intercepting fighters surprised the Japanese bombers and shot down five while losing one of their own. One section of the newly launched fighters spotted the remaining group of six B5Ns, shooting down two and badly damaging another bomber, although one Wildcat was lost to unknown causes. Another section spotted and shot down a single D3A. The surviving Japanese leaders canceled the attack after such heavy losses and all aircraft jettisoned their bombs and torpedoes. They had still not spotted the American carriers and turned for their own ships, using radio direction finders to track the carrier&#x27;s homing beacon. The beacon broadcast on a frequency very close to that of the American ships and many of the Japanese aircraft confused the ships in the darkness. A number of them flew right beside the American ships, flashing signal lights in an effort to confirm their identity, but they were not initially recognized as Japanese because the remaining Wildcats were attempting to land aboard the carriers. Finally they were recognized and fired upon, by both the Wildcats and the anti-aircraft guns of the task force, but they sustained no losses in the confused action. One Wildcat lost radio contact and could not find either of the American carriers; the pilot was never found. The remaining 18 Japanese aircraft successfully returned to their carriers, beginning at 20:00.

=====8 May=====

On the morning of 8 May, both sides spotted each other about the same time and began launching their aircraft about 09:00. The Japanese carriers launched a total of 18 Zeros, 33 D3As and 18 B5Ns. &quot;Yorktown&quot; was the first American carrier to launch her aircraft and &quot;Lexington&quot; began launching hers seven minutes later. These totaled 9 Wildcats, 15 Dauntlesses and 12 Devastators. &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s dive bombers disabled &quot;Shōkaku&quot;″s flight deck with two hits and &quot;Lexington&quot;″s aircraft were only able to further damage her with another bomb hit. None of the torpedo bombers from either carrier hit anything. The Japanese CAP was effective and shot down 3 Wildcats and 2 Dauntlesses for the loss of 2 Zeros.
The Japanese aircraft spotted the American carriers around 11:05 and the B5Ns attacked first because the D3As had to circle around to approach the carriers from upwind. American aircraft shot down four of the torpedo bombers before they could drop their torpedoes, but 10 survived long enough to hit &quot;Lexington&quot; twice on the port side at 11:20, although 4 of the B5Ns were shot down by anti-aircraft fire after dropping their torpedoes. War correspondent Stanley Johnston, who was on the signal bridge during the battle, noted five torpedo hits on the port side from 11:18 to 11:22. The shock from the first torpedo hit at the bow jammed both elevators in the up position and started small leaks in the port avgas storage tanks. The second torpedo hit her opposite the bridge, ruptured the primary port water main, and started flooding in three port fire rooms. The boilers there had to be shut down, which reduced her speed to a maximum of , and the flooding gave her a 6–7° list to port. Shortly afterward, &quot;Lexington&quot; was attacked by 19 D3As. One was shot down by fighters before it could drop its bomb and another was shot down by the carrier. She was hit by two bombs, the first of which detonated in the port forward five-inch ready ammunition locker, killing the entire crew of one five-inch gun and starting several fires. The second hit struck the funnel, doing little significant damage although fragments killed many of the crews of the .50-caliber machine guns positioned near there. The hit also jammed the ship&#x27;s siren in the &quot;on&quot; position. The remaining bombs detonated close alongside and some of their fragments pierced the hull, flooding two compartments.

Fuel was pumped from the port storage tanks to the starboard side to correct the list and &quot;Lexington&quot; began recovering damaged aircraft and those that were low on fuel at 11:39. The Japanese had shot down three of &quot;Lexington&quot;″s Wildcats and five Dauntlesses, plus another Dauntless crashed on landing. At 12:43, the ship launched five Wildcats to replace the CAP and prepared to launch another nine Dauntlesses. A massive explosion at 12:47 was triggered by sparks that ignited gasoline vapors from the cracked port avgas tanks. The explosion killed 25 crewmen and knocked out the main damage control station. The damage did not interfere with flight deck operations, although the refueling system was shut down. The fueled Dauntlesses were launched and six Wildcats that were low on fuel landed aboard. Aircraft from the morning&#x27;s air strike began landing at 13:22 and all surviving aircraft had landed by 14:14. The final tally included three Wildcats that were shot down, plus one Wildcat, three Dauntlesses and one Devastator that were forced to ditch.
Another serious explosion occurred at 14:42 that started severe fires in the hangar and blew the forward elevator above the flight deck. Power to the forward half of the ship failed shortly afterward. Fletcher sent three destroyers to assist, but another major explosion at 15:25 knocked out water pressure in the hangar and forced the evacuation of the forward machinery spaces. The fire eventually forced the evacuation of all compartments below the waterline at 16:00 and &quot;Lexington&quot; eventually drifted to a halt. Evacuation of the wounded began shortly afterward and Sherman ordered &quot;abandon ship&quot; at 17:07. A series of large explosions began around 18:00 that blew the aft elevator apart and threw aircraft into the air. Sherman waited until 18:30 to ensure that all of his crewmen were off the ship before leaving himself. Some 2,770 officers and men were rescued by the rest of the task force. The destroyer was ordered to sink the ship and fired a total of five torpedoes between 19:15 and 19:52. Immediately after the last torpedo hit, &quot;Lexington&quot; finally slipped beneath the waves at . Some 216 crewmen were killed and 2,735 were evacuated. 17 SBD Dauntless dive bombers, 13 F4F Wildcat fighters, and 12 TBD Devastator torpedo bombers, 42 planes total, went down with &quot;Lexington&quot;.

==Wreck location==
&quot;Lexington&quot;″s wreck was located on 4 March 2018 by research vessel during an expedition funded by philanthropist Paul Allen. A remotely operated underwater vehicle confirmed the ship&#x27;s identity by the nameplate on its stern. It lies at a depth of and at a distance of more than east off the coast of Queensland. The wreck lies on the seabed separated into multiple sections. The main section sits upright on the seabed; the bow rests flat with the stern sitting upright across from it, both approximately west of the main section. The bridge rests by itself in between these sections. Seven TBD Devastators, three SBD Dauntlesses, and a single F4F Wildcat were also located farther to the west—all in a good state of preservation. In 2022, an expedition was proposed to recover several TBD Devastators and the F4F Wildcat from &quot;Lexington&quot;.

==Honors and legacy==
&quot;Lexington&quot; received two battle stars for her World War II service. She was officially struck from the naval register on 24 June 1942.

In June 1942, shortly after the Navy&#x27;s public acknowledgment of the sinking, workers at the Quincy shipyard, where the ship had been built twenty-one years earlier, cabled Navy Secretary Frank Knox and proposed a change in the name of one of the new fleet carriers currently under construction from &quot;Cabot&quot; to &quot;Lexington&quot;. Knox agreed to the proposal and the carrier was renamed as the seventh on 16 June 1942.

<text>Pierre Émile Levasseur, 3rd Baron Levasseur (8 December 1828 – 10 July 1911), was a French economist, historian, Professor of geography, history and statistics in the Collège de France, at the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers and at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques, known as one of the founders and promoters of the study of commercial geography.

== Life and work ==

Levasseur was born in Paris, France, as son of the jewelry manufacturer Pierre Antoine Levasseur. He was educated at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris.

Levasseur began teaching in the lycée at Alençon in 1852, and in 1857 became professor of rhetoric at Besançon. He returned to Paris to become professor at the lycée Saint Louis. In 1868 he was chosen a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences. In 1872 he was appointed professor of geography, history and statistics in the College de France, and subsequently became also professor at the &quot;Conservatoire des arts et métiers&quot; and at the École libre des sciences politiques, which later became known as the Institut d&#x27;Etudes Politiques de Paris.
He strongly believed in the value of using statistics, graphics, and maps to teach the social sciences at a deeper level, and is credited with inventing the cartogram as a teaching aid.

Levasseur was president of the Société d&#x27;économie politique.
Levasseur was one of the founders of the study of commercial geography, and became a member of the Council of Public Instruction and honorary president of the French geographical society.

In 1886, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society. Levasseur was elected member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1894. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1905.

<text>Étienne Vacherot (29 July 180928 July 1897) was a French philosophical writer.

==Life==

Vacherot was born of peasant parentage at Torcenay, near Langres in the Haute-Marne &quot;département&quot; of France.
He was educated at the École Normale Supérieure, and returned there as director of studies in 1838, after some years spent in provincial schoolmasterships. In 1839 he succeeded his master Victor Cousin as professor of philosophy at the Sorbonne. His &quot;Histoire critique de l&#x27;école d&#x27;Alexandrie&quot; (3 vols. 1846–51), was his first and best-known work. It drew on him attacks from the Clerical party which led to his suspension in 1851. Shortly afterwards he refused to swear allegiance to the new imperial government, and was dismissed from his post. His work &quot;La Démocratie&quot; (1859) led to a political prosecution and imprisonment.

On 7 March 1868 he was elected to the Académie des sciences morales et politiques. Upon the fall of the Empire, he took an active part in politics, was mayor of a district of Paris during the siege, and in 1871 was in the National Assembly, voting as a Moderate Liberal. In 1873 he drew nearer the Conservatives, after which he was never again successful as a parliamentary candidate, though he maintained his principles vigorously in the press.

While a noted freethinker in the 1850s and 1860s, later in life Vacherot felt remorse over the growth of atheistic anticlericalism and returned to both Catholicism and monarchism, receiving Catholic burial upon his death.

The Vacherot brothers, André and Marcel, both French tennis champions, were grandsons of Étienne Vacherot.

==Philosophy==

Vacherot was a man of high character and adhered strictly to his principles, which were generally opposed to those of the party in power. His chief philosophical importance consists in the fact that he was a leader in the attempt to revivify French philosophy by the new thought of Germany, to which he had been introduced by Victor Cousin, but of which he never had more than a second-hand knowledge. Metaphysics he held to be based on psychology. He maintains the unity and freedom of the soul, and the absolute obligation of the moral law. In religion, which was his main interest, he was much influenced by Hegel, and appears somewhat in the ambiguous position of a sceptic anxious to believe. He sees insoluble contradictions in every mode of conceiving God as real, yet he advocates religious belief, though the object of that belief have but an abstract or imaginary existence.

==Works==
Besides the two works mentioned above, he wrote:
*&quot;La Métaphysique et la science&quot; (1858)
*&quot;Essais de philosophie critique&quot; (1864)
*&quot;La Religion&quot; (1869)
*&quot;La Science et la conscience&quot; (1870)
*&quot;Le Nouveau Spiritualisme&quot; (1884)
*&quot;La Démocratie libérale&quot; (1892)

<doc id="199906" wikidata="Q12008010" url="?curid=199906" title="Twenty pence (British coin)">
<text>The British decimal twenty pence coin (often shortened to 20p in writing and speech) is a denomination of sterling coinage worth of a pound. Like the 50p coin, it is an equilateral curve heptagon. Its obverse has featured the profile of the British monarch since the coin&#x27;s introduction on 9 June 1982. 

As of March 2014 there were an estimated 2,765 million 20p coins in circulation, with an estimated face value of £553.025 million. Of this estimated number, between 50,000 and 200,000 coins are undated mule coins minted in 2008 after the dies for the old and new designs were accidentally mixed up during the minting process.

Beyond the usual commemorative versions, no 20 pence coins were minted for general circulation in 2017. This was because the concurrent introduction of the new version of the one pound coin had put enough 20 pence (and two pound) coins back into circulation, as people emptied coin jars primarily for the older one pound coin that was due to be withdrawn.

Twenty pence coins are legal tender for amounts up to the sum of £10 when offered in repayment of a debt; however, the coin&#x27;s legal tender status is not normally relevant for everyday transactions.

== Design ==
===Obverse===
Four different obverses were used during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. On coins minted before the 2008 redesign, the inscription is . Coins minted after the 2008 redesign also have the year of minting on the obverse.

Like all the new decimal coins introduced in 1971, until 1984 the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Arnold Machin appeared on the obverse, in which the Queen wore the &#x27;Girls of Great Britain and Ireland&#x27; Tiara.

Between 1985 and 1997 the portrait by Raphael Maklouf was used, in which the Queen wore the George IV State Diadem.

From 1998 to 2015 the portrait by Ian Rank-Broadley was used, again featuring the tiara, with a signature-mark below the portrait.

From 2015 to 2022, 20 pence coins bore the portrait by Jody Clark.

===Reverse===

The original reverse of the coin, designed by William Gardner, and used from 1982 to 2008, was a crowned Tudor rose, with the numeral &quot;20&quot; below the rose, and above the rose.

In August 2005 the Royal Mint launched a competition to find new reverse designs for all circulating coins apart from the £2 coin. The winner, announced in April 2008, was Matthew Dent, whose designs were gradually introduced into the circulating British coinage from mid-2008. The designs for the 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p coins depicted sections of the Royal Shield that formed the whole shield when placed together. The shield in its entirety was featured on the now-obsolete round £1 coin. The 20p coin depicted the meeting point of the second and fourth quarters of the shield, showing the lions rampant of Scotland and the lions passant of England. The date no longer appeared on the reverse of the coin, but instead was added to the obverse, where the lettering was adjusted so that the date could be included.

In October 2023 the King Charles III twenty-pence coin was presented; the coin&#x27;s reverse features a puffin.

==Dateless coin==
An unusual accidental dateless version of the 20 pence was reported to be in circulation in June 2009, the first undated British coin to enter circulation in more than 300 years. This was the result of the production of a mule, i.e. a version of the coin with a non-standard combination of obverse and reverse face designs. The fault occurred as a result of the 2008 redesign of UK coinage, which moved the date on a 20 pence from the reverse to the obverse (Queen&#x27;s head side), and a batch of coins were produced using the tooling for the obverse of the old design and the reverse of the new design. The Royal Mint estimated that between 50,000 and 200,000 entered circulation before the error was noticed. The Royal Mint stated that these coins were legal tender, although due to their rarity they are traded at above face value by collectors. Following publicity about the coins, they were initially traded on eBay for several thousand pounds, although an eBay spokesman was unable to confirm if an accepted winning bid of £7,100 for one coin had actually been transacted.
In June 2011 they traded at around £100.

==Mintages==

Mint sets have been produced since 1982; where mintages on or after that date indicate &#x27;0&#x27;, there are examples contained within those sets.

<text>Émile Maximilien Paul Littré (; 1 February 18012 June 1881) was a French lexicographer, freemason and philosopher, best known for his , commonly called .

==Biography==
Littré was born in Paris. His father, Michel-François Littré, had been a gunner and, later, a sergeant-major of marine artillery in the French navy who was deeply imbued with revolutionary ideas of the day. Settling down as a tax collector, he married Sophie Johannot, a free-thinker like himself, and devoted himself to the education of his son Émile. The boy was sent to the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, where Louis Hachette and Eugène Burnouf became his friends. After he completed his studies at the lycée, he was undecided as to what career he should adopt; however, he devoted himself to mastering the English and German languages, classical and Sanskrit literature, and philology.

He finally decided to become a student of medicine in 1822. He passed all his examinations in due course, and had only his thesis to prepare in order to obtain his degree as doctor when, in 1827, his father died leaving his mother without means. He abandoned his degree at once despite his keen interest in medicine, and, while attending lectures by Pierre Rayer, began teaching Latin and Greek to earn a living. He served as a soldier for the populists during the July Revolution of 1830, and was one of the members of the National Guard who followed Charles X to Rambouillet. In 1831, he obtained an introduction to Armand Carrel, the editor of &quot;Le National&quot;, who gave him the task of reading English and German papers for excerpts. By chance, in 1835, Carrel discovered Littré&#x27;s skills as a writer and from that time on, he was a constant contributor to the journal, eventually becoming its director.

In 1836, Littré began to contribute articles on a wide range of subjects to the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;, and in 1837, he married. In 1839, the first volume of his complete works of Hippocrates appeared in print. Due to the outstanding quality of this work, he was elected to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in the same year. He noticed the works of Auguste Comte, the reading of which formed, as he himself said, &quot;the cardinal point of his life.&quot; From this time forward, the influence of positivism affected his own life, and, what is of more importance, he influenced positivism, giving as much to this philosophy as he received from it. He soon became a friend of Comte, and popularised his ideas in numerous works on the positivist philosophy. He continued translating and publishing his edition of Hippocrates&#x27; writings, which was not completed until 1862, and he published a similar edition of Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;. After 1844, he took Fauriel&#x27;s place on the committee engaged to produce the &quot;Histoire littéraire de la France&quot;, where his knowledge of the early French language and literature was invaluable.
Littré started work on his great in about 1844, which was not to be completed until thirty years later. He participated in the revolution of July 1848, and in the repression of the extreme Republican Party in June 1849. His essays, contributed during this period to the &quot;National&quot;, were collected together and published under the title of &quot;Conservation, revolution et positivisme&quot; in 1852, and show a thorough acceptance of all the doctrines propounded by Comte. However, during the later years of his master&#x27;s life, he began to perceive that he could not wholly accept all the dogmas or the more mystic ideas of his friend and master. He concealed his differences of opinion, and Comte failed to recognise that his pupil had outgrown him, as he himself had outgrown his master Henri de Saint-Simon.

Comte&#x27;s death in 1858 freed Littré from any fear of alienating his master. He published his own ideas in his &quot;Paroles de la philosophie positive&quot; in 1859. Four years later, in a work of greater length, he published &quot;Auguste Comte et la philosophie positive&quot;, which traces the origin of Comte&#x27;s ideas through Turgot, Kant, and Saint-Simon. The work eulogises Comte&#x27;s own life, his method of philosophy, his great services to the cause and the effect of his works, and proceeds to show where he himself differs from him. He approved wholly of Comte&#x27;s philosophy, his great laws of society and his philosophical method, which indeed he defended warmly against John Stuart Mill. However, he stated that, while he believed in a positivist philosophy, he did not believe in a &quot;religion of humanity&quot;.

About 1863, after completing his translations of Hippocrates and his Pliny, he began work in earnest on his great French dictionary. He was invited to join the , but declined, not wishing to associate himself with Félix Dupanloup, bishop of Orléans, who had denounced him as the head of the French materialists in his &quot;Avertissement aux pères de famille&quot;. At this time, he also started &quot;La Revue de philosophie positive&quot; with Grégoire Wyrouboff, a magazine that embodied the views of modern positivists.
Thus, his life was absorbed in literary work until the events that overthrew the Second Empire called him to take a part in politics. He felt himself too old to undergo the privations of the Siege of Paris, and retired with his family to Brittany. He was summoned by Gambetta to Bordeaux to lecture on history, and thence to Versailles to take his seat in the senate to which he had been chosen by the &quot;département&quot; of the Seine. In December 1871, he was elected a member of the in spite of the renewed opposition of Msgr. Dupanloup, who resigned his seat rather than receive him.

Littré&#x27;s (&quot;Dictionary of the French Language&quot;) was completed in 1873 after nearly 30 years of work. The draft was written on 415,636 sheets, bundled in packets of one thousand, stored in eight white wooden crates that filled the cellar of Littré&#x27;s home in Mesnil-le-Roi. The landmark effort gave authoritative definitions and usage descriptions to every word based on the various meanings it had held in the past. When it was published by Hachette, it was the largest lexicographical work on the French language at that time.

In 1874, Littré was elected Senator for life of the Third Republic. His most notable writings during these years were his political papers that attacked and revealed the confederacy of the Orléanists and Legitimists against the Republic; his re-editions of many of his old articles and books, among others the &quot;Conservation, révolution et positivisme&quot; of 1852 (which he reprinted word for word, appending a formal, categorical renunciation of many of the Comtist doctrines therein contained); and a little tract, &quot;Pour la dernière fois&quot;, in which he maintained his unalterable belief in the philosophy of Materialism.

In 1875, he applied for membership in the Masonic Lodge &quot;La Clémente Amitié&quot; (&quot;Grand Orient de France&quot;). When asked whether he believed in the existence of a supreme being in the presence of 1000 Freemasons, he replied: 

When it became obvious that Littré would not live much longer, his wife and daughter, who had always been fervent Catholics, strove to convert him to their religion. He had long discussions with Father Louis Millériot, a celebrated Controversialist, and Abbé Henri Huvelin, the noted priest of Église Saint-Augustin, who were much grieved at his death. When Littré was near death, he converted, was baptised by the abbé and his funeral was conducted with the rites of the Roman Catholic Church. Littré is interred at Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.

<text>The British decimal fifty pence coin (often shortened to 50p in writing and speech) is a denomination of sterling coinage worth of one pound. Its obverse has featured the profile of the current British monarch since the coin&#x27;s introduction in 1969. , six different royal portraits have been used.

 there were an estimated 920 million 50p coins in circulation. The coin has proved popular with coin collectors, leading to numerous differing designs for both commemorative and circulating coins.

Fifty pence coins are legal tender for amounts up to the sum of £10 when offered in repayment of a debt; however, the coin&#x27;s legal tender status is not normally relevant for everyday transactions.

==History==
In 1967 the Deputy Master of the Royal Mint approached the Decimal Currency Board to ask for their advice on the introduction of a new coin. The 10-shilling note then in use was lasting only five months, and it had been suggested that a coin, which could last fifty years, would be more economical. The problem with this was that all coins are arranged in &quot;tiers&quot;, each coin in a tier having the same weight-to-value ratio so that a bag of mixed coins could be weighed to ascertain the value so long as they were all bronze, all silver, etc. Each coin was identified within its tier by its size and each tier had to be capable of being identified by sight and touch. This was achieved in the then-existing sets by the use of different materials (&quot;bronze&quot;, &quot;brass&quot; and &quot;silver&quot;) with the bronze coins having plain rims, the nickel-brass threepenny bit being 12-sided and the silver coins having milled rims. If the 10-shilling coin were to be made in the same tier as the silver coins, it would have to be twice the weight of the Crown (then and now only in use for commemorative coins) and it was generally agreed that that would make it very unpopular and expensive. It would therefore have to be in a new tier of its own.

The Mint could not find a suitable metal which was sufficiently different in colour to the existing coins and which would not tarnish. This last point was thought to be important because the new coin would be the most valuable coin in general circulation in the world (). It therefore had to be a different shape; various methods had been used overseas to overcome this problem, but none were without drawbacks. A hole through the coin did unacceptable things to the Queen&#x27;s head (a legal requirement on British coins), and wavy-edged, flat-edged or square coins could not be used in the coin-handling machinery which was then coming into increasing use in industry, banking and vending. To be used in a vending or sorting machine a coin would have to roll under gravity and be capable of being measured without being presented in a special way; in other words it needed a constant breadth at whichever angle it was measured.

The Technical Member (and the only engineer) on the Decimal Currency Board was Hugh Conway, at that time President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and Managing Director of Bristol Siddeley Engines, Bristol. He had found in a mathematical textbook a formula for a non-circular shape of constant breadth and asked the design office at Patchway, near Bristol, which normally worked on the engines for aircraft such as Concorde, Vulcan and Harrier to draw out the shape. However, this turned out to be a wavy-edged form with re-entrant sides which would not roll and which could not be measured easily. A designer, Colin Lewis, suggested a much simpler shape which in its basic form is an equilateral triangle with a small circle centred on each apex and with a larger circular arc centred on each apex but tangential to each of the two opposite small circles. Wherever it was measured, the breadth of this shape was one small radius plus one large radius. (The small radius was not strictly necessary to the geometry, but made the shape more practical by removing inconvenient sharp points and reducing the rate of wear, and therefore change of size, in handling.) The number of corners could be any odd number greater than one. A drawing was made to illustrate the proposal, which was accepted by Hugh Conway. He chose seven sides as a compromise between too radical a shape, which might not be acceptable to the public, and having too many sides, which would make a shape visually difficult to differentiate from a circle. The shape was drawn out by David Brown and samples made from stainless steel by the Model Shop, together with a section of perspex channel with a bend to demonstrate that the &quot;coin&quot; would roll around corners and drop through gauging slots. The legend &quot;50&quot; was photo-etched (from a master drawn by Ray Gooding) on the faces of the samples since it had already been decided that the new coin would be the first coin of the new Decimal series. As the coin was released before Decimal Day it was initially worth 10/- (and therefore 120d).

When the Decimal Currency Board met, none of the other members had any suggestion to make, so when the samples were produced the idea was accepted without opposition.

==Design==
It was the first seven-sided coin in the world. However, there was some confusion and resistance to the new shape after its release on 14 October 1969, where the coins were mistaken for the decimal 10p and half crowns, which were both round. A group of &quot;Anti-Heptagonists&quot; regarded the coin as &#x27;ugly&#x27; and &#x27;an insult to our sovereign whose image it bears&#x27;. Geometrically, the shape of the coin forms an equilateral-curve heptagon, or Reuleaux polygon, a curve of constant width, meaning that the diameter is constant across any bisection.

In 1997 the 50p coin was reduced in both diameter and thickness and the older coins were removed from circulation. The new coin was introduced on 1 September 1997. The old larger coin was demonetised on 28 February 1998. The face designs remained unchanged.

The shape of the original 50p coin was also used for the 20p coin, introduced in 1982, but in a smaller size.

===Obverse (Heads)===
For Queen Elizabeth II, four different obverses have been used. In all cases, the inscription is , where 2013 is replaced by the year of minting; some additionally has the denomination, , before the year (as these coins omit the denomination on the reverse entirely).

As with all new decimal currency, until 1984 the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Arnold Machin appeared on the obverse, in which the Queen wears the &#x27;Girls of Great Britain and Ireland&#x27; Tiara.

Between 1985 and 1997 the portrait by Raphael Maklouf was used, in which the Queen wears the George IV State Diadem.

From 1998 to 2015 the portrait by Ian Rank-Broadley was used, again featuring the tiara, with a signature-mark below the portrait. In 2008 the obverse design was rotated, to match the new reverse design which is displayed with the heptagon point down rather than point up.

From 2015 to 2022, coins bearing the portrait by Jody Clark were issued, which again featured the Diadem.

On 3 October 2022, a commemorative 50p coin was released that was the first to carry the portrait of King Charles III following the death of Elizabeth II. The coin, planned both as part of a commemorative set and for general circulation, featured a copy of the design used on the crown (five-shilling piece) released in 1953 to commemorate the Queen&#x27;s coronation. The portrait of the King was undertaken by Martin Jennings.

===Reverse (Tails)===
The reverse of the coin, designed by Christopher Ironside, and used from 1969 to 2008, is a seated Britannia alongside a lion, holding an olive branch in her left hand and a trident in her right, accompanied by either (1969–1981) or (1982–2008) above Britannia, with the numeral 50 underneath the seated figure. His original but unused design, of the Royal Arms with supporters was released as a variation in 2013.

In August 2005 the Royal Mint launched a competition to find new reverse designs for all circulating coins apart from the £2 coin. The winner, announced in April 2008, was Matthew Dent, whose designs were gradually introduced into the circulating British coinage from mid-2008. The designs for the 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p coins depict sections of the Royal Shield that form the whole shield when placed together. The shield in its entirety was featured on the now-obsolete round £1 coin. The 50p coin depicts the lowest point of the Shield, with the words below the point of the shield. The coin&#x27;s obverse remains unchanged.

In October 2023 the King Charles III fifty-pence coin was presented; the coin features an Atlantic salmon.

==Variations==
In addition to the standard designs there have been several variant reverse designs used on the 50p coin to commemorate important events. These are summarised in the table below.

The following coins were produced by the Royal Mint as commemorative releases only, without being intended for release into circulation:
There are also other variants not listed here which were minted by other Mints, such as Pobjoy Mint

==Mintages==

Mint sets have been produced since 1982; where mintages on or after that date indicate &#x27;none&#x27; or &#x27;Proof only&#x27;, there are examples contained within those sets.

<text>The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s and 1930s in which jazz music and dance styles gained worldwide popularity. The Jazz Age&#x27;s cultural repercussions were primarily felt in the United States, the birthplace of jazz. Originating in New Orleans as mainly sourced from the culture of African Americans, jazz played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on popular culture continued long afterwards. 

The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties, and overlapped in significant cross-cultural ways with the Prohibition Era. The movement was largely affected by the introduction of radios nationwide. During this time, the Jazz Age was intertwined with the developing youth culture. The movement would also help in introducing jazz culture to Europe.

== Background ==
The term &quot;jazz age&quot; was in popular usage prior to 1920. In 1922, American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald further popularized the term with the publication of his short story collection &quot;Tales of the Jazz Age&quot;.

=== Jazz music ===

Jazz is a music genre that originated in the Black-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime. New Orleans provided a cultural humus in which jazz could germinate because it was a port city with many cultures and beliefs intertwined. In New Orleans, people of different cultures and races often lived close together which allowed for cultural interaction which facilitated the development of the active musical environment of the city. In New Orleans, the development of jazz was influenced by Creole music, ragtime, and blues.

Jazz is seen by many as &quot;America&#x27;s classical music&quot;. The earliest Jazz styles, which emerged in New Orleans, Chicago, and New York in the early 1920s, are sometimes referred to as &quot;dixieland jazz.&quot; In the 1920s, jazz became recognized as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of Black-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation. From African traditions, jazz derived its rhythm, &quot;blues&quot;, and traditions of playing or singing in one&#x27;s own expressive way. From European traditions, jazz derived its harmony and instruments.

Louis Armstrong brought the improvisational solo to the forefront of a piece, replacing the original polyphonic ensemble style of New Orleans jazz. Jazz is generally characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation.

=== Prohibition ===

Prohibition in the United States was a nationwide constitutional ban on the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages from 1920 to 1933. In the 1920s, the laws were widely disregarded, and tax revenues were lost. Well-organized criminal gangs took control of the beer and liquor supply for many cities, unleashing a crime wave that shocked the U.S. This prohibition was taken advantage of by gangsters such as Al Capone, and approximately $60 million () in illegal alcohol was smuggled across the borders of Canada and the United States. The resulting illicit speakeasies that grew from this era became lively venues of the &quot;Jazz Age&quot;, hosting popular music that included current dance songs, novelty songs and show tunes.

By the late 1920s, a new opposition mobilized across the U.S. Anti-prohibitionists, or &quot;wets&quot;, attacked prohibition as causing crime, lowering local revenues, and imposing rural Protestant religious values on urban America. Prohibition ended with the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed the Eighteenth Amendment on December 5, 1933. Some states continued statewide prohibition, marking one of the latter stages of the Progressive Era.

===Speakeasies===
Formed as a result of the eighteenth amendment, speakeasies were places (often owned by organized criminals) where customers could drink alcohol and relax or speakeasy. Jazz was played in these speakeasies as a countercultural type of music to fit in with the illicit environment and events going on. Jazz artists were therefore hired to play at speakeasies. Al Capone, the famous organized crime leader, gave jazz musicians previously living in poverty a steady and professional income. Thaddeus Russell, in &quot;A Renegade History of the United States&quot;, states: &quot;The singer Ethel Waters fondly recalled that Capone treated her &#x27;with respect, applause, deference, and paid in full.&#x27;&quot; Also from A Renegade History of the United States, &quot;The pianist Earl Hines remembered that &#x27;Scarface [Al Capone] got along well with musicians. He liked to come into a club with his henchmen and have the band play his requests. He was very free with $100 tips.&quot; The illegal culture of speakeasies led to what was known as ‘black and tan’ clubs which had multiracial crowds.

There were many speakeasies, especially in Chicago and New York City. New York City had, at the height of Prohibition, 32,000 speakeasies. At speakeasies, both payoffs and mechanisms for hiding alcohol were used. Charlie Burns, in recalling his ownership of several speakeasies employed these strategies as a way to preserve his and Jack Kriendler&#x27;s illegal clubs. This includes forming relationships with local police. Mechanisms that a trusted engineer created include one that when a button was pushed, tongue blocks under shelves of liquor would drop, making the shelves drop back and liquor bottles fall down a chute, break, and drain the alcohol through rocks and sand. An alarm also went off if the button was pushed to alert customers of a raid. Another mechanism used by Burns was a wine cellar with a thick door flush with the wall. It had a small, almost unnoticeable hole for a rod to be pushed in to activate a lock and open the door.

=== Rum running/bootlegging ===
As to where speakeasies obtained alcohol, there were rum runners and bootleggers. Rum running, in this case, was the organized smuggling of liquor by land or sea into the U.S. Decent foreign liquor was high-end alcohol during prohibition, and William McCoy had some of the best of it. Bill McCoy was in the rum-running business, and at certain points of time was ranked among the best. To avoid being caught, he sold liquor just outside the territorial waters of the United States. Buyers would come to him to pick up his booze as a precaution for McCoy. McCoy&#x27;s liquor specialty was selling high-quality whiskey without diluting the alcohol. Bootlegging was making and or smuggling alcohol around the U.S. As selling the alcohol could make plenty of money, there are several major ways this was done. One strategy used by Frankie Yale and the Genna brothers gang (both involved in organized crime) was to give poor Italian Americans alcohol stills to make alcohol for them at $15 per day&#x27;s work. Another strategy was to buy liquor from rumrunners. Racketeers would also buy closed breweries and distilleries and hire former employees to make alcohol. Another person famous for organized crime named Johnny Torrio partnered with two other mobsters and legitimate brewer Joseph Stenson to make illegal beer in a total of nine breweries. Finally, some racketeers stole industrial grain alcohol and redistilled it to sell in speakeasies.

== History ==
From 1919, Kid Ory&#x27;s Original Creole Jazz Band of musicians from New Orleans played in San Francisco and Los Angeles, where in 1922 they became the first black jazz band of New Orleans origin to make recordings. The year also saw the first recording by Bessie Smith, the most famous of the 1920s blues singers. Chicago, meanwhile, was the main center developing the new &quot;Hot Jazz&quot;, where King Oliver joined Bill Johnson. Bix Beiderbecke formed The Wolverines in 1924.
The same year, Louis Armstrong joined the Fletcher Henderson dance band as featured soloist, leaving in 1925. The original New Orleans style was polyphonic, with theme variation and simultaneous collective improvisation. Armstrong was a master of his hometown style, but by the time he joined Henderson&#x27;s band, he was already a trailblazer in a new phase of jazz, with its emphasis on arrangements and soloists. Armstrong&#x27;s solos went well beyond the theme-improvisation concept, and extemporized on chords, rather than melodies. According to Schuller, by comparison, the solos by Armstrong&#x27;s bandmates (including a young Coleman Hawkins), sounded &quot;stiff, stodgy,&quot; with &quot;jerky rhythms and a grey undistinguished tone quality.&quot; The following example shows a short excerpt of the straight melody of &quot;Mandy, Make Up Your Mind&quot; by George W. Meyer and Arthur Johnston (top), compared with Armstrong&#x27;s solo improvisations (below) (recorded 1924). (The example approximates Armstrong&#x27;s solo, as it does not convey his use of swing.)

Armstrong&#x27;s solos were a significant factor in making jazz a true 20th-century language. After leaving Henderson&#x27;s group, Armstrong formed his virtuosic Hot Five band, which included instrumentalist&#x27;s Kid Ory (trombone), Johnny Dodds (clarinet), Johnny St. Cyr (banjo), and wife Lil on piano, where he popularized scat singing.
Jelly Roll Morton recorded with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings in an early mixed-race collaboration, then in 1926 formed his Red Hot Peppers. There was a larger market for jazzy dance music played by white orchestras, such as Jean Goldkette&#x27;s orchestra and Paul Whiteman&#x27;s orchestra. In 1924, Whiteman commissioned Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, premiered by Whiteman&#x27;s Orchestra. Writer F. Scott Fitzgerald opined that &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; idealized the youthful zeitgeist of the Jazz Age. By the mid-1920s, Whiteman was the most popular bandleader in the U.S. His success was based on a &quot;rhetoric of domestication&quot; according to which he had elevated and rendered valuable a previously inchoate kind of music. Other influential large ensembles included Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s band, Duke Ellington&#x27;s band (which opened an influential residency at the Cotton Club in 1927) in New York, and Earl Hines&#x27; Band in Chicago (who opened in The Grand Terrace Cafe there in 1928). All significantly influenced the development of big band-style swing jazz. By 1930, the New Orleans-style ensemble was a relic, and jazz belonged to the world.

Several musicians grew up in musical families, where a family member would often teach how to read and play music. Included in this group was the bandleader Guy Lombardo, who collaborated with his brothers Carmen and Lebert in Canada to form the Royal Canadians Orchestra in the early 1920s. By 1929 their &quot;sweet&quot; big band appeared regularly at the landmark Roosevelt Hotel in New York City and later in 1959 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where they entertained audiences nationwide for decades with a velvety-smooth interpretation of the &quot;sweetest music this side of heaven&quot;. Despite Benny Goodman&#x27;s claim that &quot;sweet&quot; music was a &quot;weak sister&quot; as compared to the &quot;real music&quot; of America, Lombardo&#x27;s band enjoyed widespread popularity which crossed racial divides and was even praised by Louis Armstrong as one of his favorites. 

Some musicians, like Pops Foster, learned on homemade instruments.

Urban radio stations played African-American jazz more frequently than suburban stations, due to the concentration of African Americans in urban areas such as New York and Chicago. Younger demographics popularized the black-originated dances such as the Charleston as part of the immense cultural shift the popularity of jazz music generated.

Jazz aimed to cultivate empathy by initially challenging established norms and those who adhered to them, before captivating them with its ethereal and enchanting allure. It sought to blur the societal divides of race, class, and political allegiance, as illustrated in James Baldwin&#x27;s renowned short story, &quot;Sonny&#x27;s Blues,&quot; where the transformative power of jazz unites two estranged brothers through the deeply emotive melodies played by Sonny. In Fitzgerald&#x27;s works and beyond, jazz acted as a leveling influence, fostering a degree of equality within both literature and society.

In 1925, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; epitomized this phase of Fitzgerald&#x27;s career, capturing the romanticism and superficial charm of the &quot;Jazz Age.&quot; This era started with the conclusion of World War I, the onset of women&#x27;s suffrage, and Prohibition, and ultimately crumbled with the Great Crash of 1929.

=== Swing in the 1930s ===

The 1930s belonged to popular swing big bands, in which some virtuoso soloists became as famous as the band leaders. Key figures in developing the &quot;big&quot; jazz band included bandleaders and arrangers Count Basie, Cab Calloway, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Fletcher Henderson, Earl Hines, Harry James, Jimmie Lunceford, Glenn Miller and Artie Shaw. Although it was a collective sound, swing also offered individual musicians a chance to &quot;solo&quot; and improvise melodic, thematic solos which could at times be complex &quot;important&quot; music.

Over time, social strictures regarding racial segregation began to relax in America: white bandleaders began to recruit black musicians and black bandleaders recruit white ones. In the mid-1930s, Benny Goodman hired pianist Teddy Wilson, vibraphonist Lionel Hampton and guitarist Charlie Christian to join small groups. In the 1930s, Kansas City Jazz as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. An early 1940s style known as &quot;jumping the blues&quot; or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music and blues chord progressions, drawing on boogie-woogie from the 1930s.

== Radio ==
The introduction of large-scale radio broadcasts enabled the rapid national spread of jazz in 1932. The radio was described as the &quot;sound factory.&quot; Radio made it possible for millions to hear music for free — especially people who never attended expensive, distant big city clubs. These broadcasts originated from clubs in leading centers such as New York, Chicago, Kansas City, and Los Angeles. There were two categories of live music on the radio: concert music and big band dance music. The concert music was known as &quot;potter palm&quot; and was concert music by amateurs, usually volunteers. Big band dance music is played by professionals and was featured in remote broadcasts from nightclubs, dance halls, and ballrooms. 

Musicologist Charles Hamm described three types of jazz music at the time: black music for black audiences, black music for white audiences, and white music for white audiences. Jazz artists like Louis Armstrong originally received very little airtime because most stations preferred to play the music of white American jazz singers. Other jazz vocalists include Bessie Smith and Florence Mills. In urban areas, such as Chicago and New York, African-American jazz was played on the radio more often than in the suburbs. Big-band jazz, like that of James Reese Europe and Fletcher Henderson in New York, attracted large radio audiences.

Several &quot;sweet jazz&quot; dance orchestras also achieved national recognition in big band remote broadcasts including: Guy Lombardo&#x27;s Royal Canadian Orchestra, at New York City&#x27;s Roosevelt Hotel (1929) and at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel (1959), and Shep Fields&#x27;s Rippling Rhythm Orchestra at Chicago&#x27;s landmark Palmer House Hotel (1936), New York City&#x27;s &quot;Star-light Roof&quot; in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel (1937), and the Copacabana nightclub.

== Elements and influences ==
=== Youth ===
Young people in the 1920s used the influence of jazz to rebel against the traditional culture of previous generations. This youth rebellion of the 1920s included such things as flapper fashions, women who smoked cigarettes in public, a willingness to talk about sex freely, and radio concerts. Dances like the Charleston, developed by African Americans, suddenly became popular among the youth. Traditionalists were aghast at what they considered the breakdown of morality. Some urban middle-class African Americans perceived jazz as &quot;devil&#x27;s music&quot;, and believed the improvised rhythms and sounds were promoting promiscuity.

Jazz served as a platform for rebellion on multiple fronts. In dance halls, jazz clubs, and speakeasies, women found refuge from societal norms that confined them to conventional roles. These spaces offered them more freedom in their speech, attire, and behavior. Reflecting the prevalent Freudian psychology of the 1920s, jazz promoted &quot;childlike&quot; behavior, with frequenters known as Flappers often called &quot;Jazz Babies.&quot; The uninhibited and spontaneous nature of jazz encouraged primal and sensual expression. As the older generation dismissed jazz, it became a vehicle for young women (and men) to challenge the values of their parents and grandparents.

=== Role of women ===

With women&#x27;s suffrage—the right for women to vote—at its peak with the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment on August 18, 1920, and the entrance of the free-spirited flapper, women began to take on a larger role in society and culture. With women now taking part in the work force after the end of the First World War there were now many more possibilities for women in terms of social life and entertainment. Ideas such as equality and open sexuality were very popular during the time and women seemed to capitalize on these ideas during this period. The 1920s saw the emergence of many famous women musicians, including Bessie Smith. Bessie Smith gained attention because she was not only a great singer but also an African-American woman as well as an icon in the LGBTQ+ community. Throughout her musical career she was unapologetically herself, expressing the struggles of the Black working class, addressing issues such as poverty, racism, and sexism alongside themes of love and female sexuality in her lyrics. She has grown through the ages to be one of the most well respected singers of all time and inspired later performers such as Billie Holiday.

Lovie Austin (1887–1972) was a Chicago-based bandleader, session musician (piano), composer, singer, and arranger during the 1920s classic blues era. She and Lil Hardin Armstrong often are ranked as two of the best female jazz blues piano players of the period.

Piano player Lil Hardin Armstrong was originally a member of King Oliver&#x27;s band with Louis, and went on to play piano in her husband&#x27;s band the Hot Five and then his next group called the Hot Seven. It was not until the 1930s and 1940s that many women jazz singers, such as Bessie Smith and Billie Holiday, were recognized as successful artists in the music world. Another famous female vocalist who attained stardom at the tail-end of the Jazz Age was Ella Fitzgerald, one of the more popular female jazz singers in the United States for more than half a century and later dubbed &quot;The First Lady of Song&quot;. She worked with all the jazz greats of the era, including Chick Webb, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Benny Goodman. These women were persistent in striving to make their names known in the music industry and to lead the way for many more women artists to come.

=== Influence of middle-class white Americans ===
The birth of jazz is credited to African Americans. But it was modified to become socially acceptable to middle-class white Americans. Those critical of jazz saw it as music from people with no training or skill. White performers were used as a vehicle for the popularization of jazz music in America. Although jazz was taken over by the white middle-class population, it facilitated the mesh of African American traditions and ideals with white middle-class society.

=== Beginnings of European jazz ===
By the 1920s jazz had spread around the world. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1922:

As only a limited number of American jazz records were released in Europe, European jazz traces many of its roots to American artists such as James Reese Europe, Paul Whiteman, Mike Danzi and Lonnie Johnson, who visited Europe during and after World War I. It was their live performances which inspired European audiences&#x27; interest in jazz, as well as the interest in all things American (and therefore exotic) which accompanied the economic and political woes of Europe during this time. The beginnings of a distinct European style of jazz began to emerge in this interwar period.

British jazz began with a tour by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919. In 1926, Fred Elizalde and His Cambridge Undergraduates began broadcasting on the BBC. Thereafter jazz became an important element in many leading dance orchestras, and jazz instrumentalists became numerous. Very soon, the resulting music craze in the United Kingdom led to a moral panic in which the threat of jazz to society was exemplified by Scottish artist John Bulloch Souter&#x27;s controversial 1926 painting &quot;The Breakdown&quot;. The painting has been described as embodying the fears of Western civilization towards jazz music, and the painting was later destroyed by its author to placate critics who insisted the work should be burned.

The European style of jazz entered full swing in France with the Quintette du Hot Club de France, which began in 1934. Much of this French jazz was a combination of African-American jazz and the symphonic styles in which French musicians were well-trained; in this, it is easy to see the inspiration taken from Paul Whiteman since his style was also a fusion of the two. Belgian guitarist Django Reinhardt popularized gypsy jazz, a mix of 1930s American swing, French dance hall &quot;musette&quot;, and Eastern European folk with a languid, seductive feel; the main instruments were steel-stringed guitar, violin, and double bass. Solos pass from one player to another as guitar and bass form the rhythm section. Some researchers believe Eddie Lang and Joe Venuti pioneered the guitar-violin partnership characteristic of the genre which was brought to France after they had been heard live or on Okeh Records in the late 1920s.

=== South African Jazz ===
After the discovery of natural resources which boosted the country&#x27;s economy during the late 19th century and early 20th century, South Africa became urbanised rapidly after its formation in 1910 with Black people leaving their native rural villages to go and work in the city/town in order to earn an income.

Due to discriminative laws that forbade black people from living in the suburbs and owning property, most of them ended up living in slums which became townships. In these slums, shebeens were opened by black women with the purpose of selling home-made, Traditional African beer (locally known as &#x27;Umqombothi&#x27;) in order to earn an income.

Eventually, these shebeens would provide a nightlife for black people who were living in these slums. During this period in the early 20th century, American jazz was introduced on South African radios, and it became the most popular style of music in the urban areas of South Africa. The biggest consumer of jazz music was the newly black urban class in these shebeens based on the slums of South Africa. Therefore, jazz got fused with African Traditional Music and a new style/genre was formed called Marabi.

In the 1940s, the genre had taken the country by storm, and by the 1950s, another style of South African jazz was formed called Kwela with an addition of the modern or traditional pennywhistle. South African jazz has created many stars of which some became famous worldwide e.g. Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela.

== Criticism of the movement ==
During this period, jazz began to get a reputation as being immoral, and many members of the older generations saw it as threatening the old cultural values and promoting the new decadent values of the Roaring Twenties. Professor Henry van Dyke of Princeton University wrote: &quot;[I]t is not music at all. It&#x27;s merely an irritation of the nerves of hearing, a sensual teasing of the strings of physical passion.&quot; The media also spoke ill of it. &quot;The New York Times&quot; in the 1920s intimated that jazz was responsible for the decline of Western civilization and of the quality of Italian tenors, a poor trade balance with Hungary, a classical musician&#x27;s fatal heart attack, and frightening bears in Siberia.

=== Classical music ===
As jazz flourished, American elites who preferred classical music sought to expand the listenership of their favored genre, hoping that jazz would not become mainstream. Conversely, jazz became an influence on composers as diverse as George Gershwin and Herbert Howells.

<text>Peter Malcolm Gordon Moffett (born 13 April 1951), known professionally as Peter Davison, is an English actor. He made his television acting debut in 1975 and became famous in 1978 as Tristan Farnon in the BBC&#x27;s television adaptation of James Herriot&#x27;s &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; stories. He subsequently played the fifth incarnation of the Doctor in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; from 1981 to 1984.

Davison&#x27;s other starring roles included the sitcoms &quot;Holding the Fort&quot; (1980–1982) and &quot;Sink or Swim&quot; (1980–1982), Dr. Stephen Daker in &quot;A Very Peculiar Practice&quot; (1986–1988), and Albert Campion in &quot;Campion&quot; (1989–1990). He also played David Braithwaite in &quot;At Home with the Braithwaites&quot; (2000–2003), &quot;Dangerous&quot; Davies in &quot;The Last Detective&quot; (2003–2007), and Henry Sharpe in &quot;Law &amp; Order: UK&quot; (2011–2014).

==Early life==
Davison was born to Claude and Sheila Moffett in Streatham, London. Claude was from British Guiana (now Guyana), and worked as a radio engineer before opening a grocer&#x27;s shop, while Sheila worked in intelligence during World War II before becoming a housewife. Davison had three sisters: Shirley, Pamela and Barbara. While in Streatham, he attended Granton Primary School. The family then moved to Knaphill in Surrey. During this time, Davison was a member of an amateur theatre company called the Byfleet Players.

Before becoming an actor, Davison gained one O-level in English Language at Winston Churchill School, St John&#x27;s, Woking, Surrey, and then had several odd jobs, including a stint as a mortuary attendant and a Hoffman Press operator. Early aspirations at a teacher-training college or his father&#x27;s plan for a job at a building society vanished.

Davison studied at the Central School of Speech and Drama. His first job was as an actor and assistant stage manager at the Nottingham Playhouse. He chose the stage name Peter Davison to avoid confusion with the actor and director Peter Moffatt, with whom Davison later worked. He only uses Davison professionally.

==Career==
Davison&#x27;s first television work was a 1975 episode of the children&#x27;s science fiction television programme &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;, alongside American actress Sandra Dickinson, whom he married on 26 December 1978. Davison portrayed an alien named Elmer, who arrives on Earth along with his sister (played by Dickinson) and his mother, known as &quot;the Mama&quot; (played by Margaret Burton).In the mid-1970s, during a lull in his acting career, Davison spent 18 months working in a tax office in Twickenham. In 1976, Davison was offered a prominent role in the 13-part TV series &quot;Love for Lydia&quot; opposite Jeremy Irons; the series was broadcast on ITV the following year.

Davison has also appeared in several British sitcoms, including &quot;Holding the Fort&quot; (1980–82) and &quot;Sink or Swim&quot; (1980–82), as well as appearing in dramatic roles.

===&quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; (1978–1990)===
In 1978, Davison&#x27;s performance as the youthfully mischievous Tristan Farnon in &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; made him a household name. Davison was absent for 24 episodes in the second run of the series, including the majority of series five and six, due to other acting commitments. 

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot; (1981–1984 and later revivals)===

In 1980, Davison signed a contract to play the fifth incarnation of the Doctor in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for three years, succeeding Tom Baker (the Fourth Doctor) and, at age 29, was at the time the youngest actor to have played the lead role, a record he retained for nearly thirty years until Matt Smith (the Eleventh Doctor) took the role in 2009 at age 26. He was also the first mixed race actor to portray the character. Attracting such a high-profile actor as Davison was as much of a coup for the programme as getting the role was for him, but he did not renew his contract because he feared being typecast. Patrick Troughton (who had played the Second Doctor and whom Davison had watched on the programme as a teenager) recommended to Davison that he leave the role after three years, and Davison followed his advice. The Fifth Doctor encountered many of the Doctor&#x27;s best-known adversaries, including the Cybermen in &quot;Earthshock&quot; (1982) and the Daleks and Davros in &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; (1984). In the 1983 serial &quot;Arc of Infinity&quot;, in addition to portraying the Fifth Doctor, Davison portrayed the human form of Omega, sharing the role with Ian Collier.

Since 1999, Davison has reprised his role as the Fifth Doctor in numerous &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio dramas for Big Finish Productions; he also reprised the role of Omega in an audio drama of the same name, again sharing the role with Collier. He returned to the TV series in &quot;Time Crash&quot;, a special episode written by Steven Moffat for Children in Need; in the episode (2007) the Fifth Doctor met the Tenth Doctor, played by Davison&#x27;s future son-in-law David Tennant. 
Davison has been critical of some aspects of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s original run, and has expressed great admiration for the 21st century revival. In 2008, he spoke unfavourably of some of the writing for the series during his tenure, saying some of the scripts had been &quot;suspect&quot; and &quot;knocked off&quot; by authors who had not been science fiction fans, which he contrasted with the revived series and Big Finish audio productions. In 2013, he also praised the frisson between the Doctor and companions in the revived series, and argued that the previous series had struggled to &quot;write a good companion&#x27;s part&quot; because &quot;they never once thought it was a good idea to put any frisson or sexual tension – even in its most innocent form – between the Doctor and companion&quot;. Davison said the series had failed to write a good companion&#x27;s part until Rose, when the series came back. Interviewed in 2013, Davison stated that &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot;, &quot;The Visitation&quot; and &quot;Earthshock&quot; were his favourite serials from his time on the series, and that &quot;Time-Flight&quot; was the biggest disappointment because of a lack of budget.

In 2013, Davison said he had a &quot;slight problem&quot; with a female Doctor, which he compared to having &quot;a female James Bond&quot;. In July 2017, Davison reacted positively to the casting of Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor, but said he was sad about &quot;the loss of a role model for boys&quot;. Davison closed his Twitter account following the backlash to his comments, saying the &quot;toxicity&quot; from the series’ viewers on both sides of the dispute had been &quot;sobering&quot;.

In 2022, Davison returned to portray the Doctor on television again in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;. He reprised the role again in &quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot;.

===1984–present===
After Davison left &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1984, he took a role in &quot;Anna of the Five Towns&quot;, a period drama. In 1985, he appeared in an &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; Christmas special, and a feature-length episode of the American show &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; (&quot;Deja Vu&quot;), set in the UK. Davison played Dr Stephen Daker, the central character in &quot;A Very Peculiar Practice&quot; (1986–88). Written by Andrew Davies, it concerns a university&#x27;s health centre; Daker is the centre&#x27;s only effective physician. The black comedy-drama ran for two series and had a sequel with &quot;A Very Polish Practice&quot; in 1992, a television film mainly set in a post-communist Polish hospital. In 1986 he appeared as Lance Fortescue in an episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Miss Marple&quot; (&quot;A Pocketful of Rye&quot;). 

Davison reprised his role as Tristan Farnon in four more series of &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; between 1988 and 1990, although he was absent from 24 episodes of the final three to play the lead in &quot;Campion&quot;, a series based on the period whodunnits of Margery Allingham. He appeared in the sitcoms &quot;Fiddlers Three&quot; for ITV in 1991, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot; in 1993 and 1995. He played Jim Huxtable in the 1993 TV movie &quot;Harnessing Peacocks&quot;, based on the novel by Mary Wesley.

In 1994, Davison provided the voice of Mole in &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; animated special &quot;Mole&#x27;s Christmas&quot;. He also appeared as a doctor in &quot;Heartbeat&quot; episode &quot;A Bird in the Hand&quot;, and played Squire Gordon in the 1994 film of &quot;Black Beauty&quot;. Davison presented &quot;Heavenly Bodies&quot;, a six-part series about astronomy (1995). Davison guest starred in the sixth episode of the crime drama &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot; in 1998 as the son-in-law of a horror writer who was shot dead on Halloween. The following year he played the outgoing head teacher in the television series &quot;Hope and Glory&quot;, and appeared in &quot;Parting Shots&quot;, the last film to be directed by Michael Winner.

In 2000, Davison returned to another major role as David Braithwaite in &quot;At Home with the Braithwaites&quot;. During convention appearances in 2013, Davison cited this as his favourite among the roles he has played. Also in 2000, he appeared in the recurring role of Inspector Christmas in several episodes of Diana Rigg&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Bradley Mysteries&quot;. The first episode, &quot;Death at the Opera&quot;, saw Davison appear with his future son-in-law (and future Doctor Who actor), David Tennant. Davison starred as Dangerous Davies in the television series &quot;The Last Detective&quot; (2003–2007) and as Dr Bill Shore in &quot;Distant Shores&quot; (2005–2008), both for ITV. In 2006, he appeared as Professor George Huntley in &quot;The Complete Guide to Parenting&quot;, and appeared as himself in the TV series &quot;Hardware&quot;. Davison starred as Martin Chadwick, one half of an overworked couple coping with two irresponsible daughters and his senile mother at home, in the BBC Two comedy &quot;Fear, Stress and Anger&quot; (2007). The show also starred his daughter Georgia Tennant. Later in 2007, he played Hubert Curtain in an episode of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot; (&quot;At Bertram&#x27;s Hotel&quot;).

In 2009, Davison appeared in &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, an ITV1 drama starring Suranne Jones. Davison played John Ingrams, a lawyer who helps Jones&#x27; character, Ruth Slater, find her sister after her release from prison. In July 2009, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, and made a guest appearance as a teacher in the sitcom &quot;Miranda&quot; (2009). In 2009, Davison had a small role as a bank manager in &quot;Micro Men&quot;, a drama about the rise of the British home computer market in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 2009, he played Denis Thatcher in &quot;The Queen&quot;, a docudrama on Channel 4.

In 2010, Davison was announced as joining the regular cast of the UK version of &quot;Law and Order&quot; as Henry Sharpe, the Director of the London Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Davison appeared from the beginning of the series&#x27; fifth season, alongside fellow &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actress Freema Agyeman. He appeared in an episode of the police comedy-drama &quot;New Tricks&quot; (2011), and in 2013 he played divorcee Michael in the comedy series &quot;Pat and Cabbage&quot;, as well as appearing in an episode of the ITV detective series &quot;Lewis&quot;.

Davison had been lined up to appear in writer/director Daisy Aitkens&#x27; first feature-length film &quot;You, Me and Him&quot;(2016). However, due to a scheduling clash, Davison was forced to pull out of the film. The film stars his son-in-law David Tennant, and is co-produced by Davison&#x27;s daughter, Georgia. In 2017, Davison appeared in an episode of the third series of &quot;Grantchester&quot;, playing a cricket-loving solicitor.

Davison appeared with Christopher Timothy in the three-part series &quot;Great British Car Journeys&quot;(2018) (known internationally as &quot;Vintage Roads Great &amp; Small&quot;) for More4. In the first series the pair travelled in a Morgan 4/4 on three trips from London to Land&#x27;s End, from Loch Ness to The Isle of Skye and from Cardiff to Snowdonia. The series was recommissioned by Channel 4 for a second series on More4 (2019). He narrated the tenth season of Channel 5&#x27;s documentary series, &quot;The Yorkshire Vet&quot;, which follows a number of veterinarians working in Weatherby, Kirkbymoorside and Huddersfield.

His brother Joel also made his theatrical debut aged 13 in the summer of 2014, playing Jack in &quot;The Widowing of Mrs Holroyd&quot; at the Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond. Louis Davison plays the part of Victor in Tim Burton&#x27;s film, &quot;Miss Peregrine&#x27;s Home for Peculiar Children&quot; released in 2016, and Joel Davison played Lord Heybrook in &quot;French Without Tears&quot; at the Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond. Louis has appeared as Parker Whitfield in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Holby City&quot;, and as King Edmund Ironside in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

Davison&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Is There Life Outside the Box?: An Actor Despairs&quot;, was published in 2016.

==Political views==
In April 2010, Davison declared his support for the Labour Party at the general election of that year. In the election campaign, Davison narrated one of Labour&#x27;s election broadcasts. Davison was also one of 48 celebrities who signed a letter warning voters against Conservative Party policy towards the BBC.

Davison publicly supported the UK&#x27;s membership of the European Union in the 2016 EU referendum, describing Brexit supporters as &quot;mad old farts who want to return the country to an age that never existed&quot;.

<text>A kelpie, or water kelpie (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;each-uisge&quot;), is a mythical shape-shifting spirit inhabiting lochs in Scottish and Yorkshire folklore. It is usually described as a grey or white horse-like creature, able to adopt human form. Some accounts state that the kelpie retains its hooves when appearing as a human, leading to its association with the Christian idea of Satan as alluded to by Robert Burns in his 1786 poem &quot;Address to the Devil&quot;.

Almost every sizeable body of water in Scotland has an associated kelpie story, but the most extensively reported is that of Loch Ness. The kelpie has counterparts across the world, such as the Germanic nixie, the wihwin of Central America and the Australian bunyip. The origins of narratives about the creature are unclear, but the practical purposes of keeping children away from dangerous stretches of water and warning young women to be wary of handsome strangers has been noted in secondary literature.

Kelpies have been portrayed in their various forms in art and literature, including two steel sculptures in Falkirk, &quot;The Kelpies&quot;, completed in October 2013.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the Scots word &quot;kelpie&quot; is uncertain, but it may be derived from the Gaelic &quot;calpa&quot; or &quot;cailpeach&quot;, meaning &quot;heifer&quot; or &quot;colt&quot;. The first recorded use of the term to describe a mythological creature, then spelled &quot;kaelpie&quot;, appears in the manuscript of an ode by William Collins, composed some time before 1759 and reproduced in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh of 1788. The place names Kelpie hoall and Kelpie hooll are reported in &quot;A Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue&quot; as appearing in the 1674 burgh records for Kirkcudbright.

==Folk beliefs==

===Description and common attributes===
The kelpie is the most common water spirit in Scottish folklore, and the name is attributed to several different forms in narratives recorded throughout the country. The late 19th century saw the onset of an interest in transcribing folklore, and recorders were inconsistent in spelling and frequently anglicised words, which could result in differing names for the same spirit.

Commentators have disagreed over the kelpie&#x27;s aquatic habitat. Folklorists who define kelpies as spirits living beside rivers, as distinguished from the Celtic lochside-dwelling water horse (&quot;each-uisge&quot;), include 19th-century minister of Tiree John Gregorson Campbell and 20th-century writers Lewis Spence and Katharine Briggs. This distinction is not universally applied however; Sir Walter Scott for instance claims that the kelpie&#x27;s range may extend to lochs. Mackillop&#x27;s dictionary reconciles the discrepancy, stating that the kelpie was &quot;initially thought to inhabit ... streams, and later any body of water.&quot; But the distinction should stand, argues one annotator, who suggests that people are led astray when an &quot;each uisge&quot; in a &quot;common practice of translating&quot; are referred to as kelpies in English accounts, and thus mistakenly attribute loch-dwelling habits to the latter.

Others associate the term &quot;kelpie&quot; with a wide variety of legendary creatures. Counterparts in some regions of Scotland include the shoopiltee and nuggle of Shetland and the tangie of Orkney; in other parts of the British Islands they include the Welsh ceffyl dŵr and the Manx cabbyl-ushtey. Parallels to the general Germanic neck and the Scandinavian bäckahäst have been observed; Nick Middleton observes that &quot;the kelpie of Scottish folklore is a direct parallel of the [sic] bäckahästen [of Scandinavian folklore]&quot;. The wihwin of Central America and the Australian bunyip are seen as similar creatures in other parts of the world.

The kelpie is usually described as a powerful and beautiful black horse inhabiting the deep pools of rivers and streams of Scotland, preying on any humans it encounters. One of the water-kelpie&#x27;s common identifying characteristics is that its hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse, a trait also shared by the &quot;nykur&quot; of Iceland. An Aberdeenshire variation portrays the kelpie as a horse with a mane of serpents, whereas the resident equine spirit of the River Spey was white and could entice victims onto its back by singing.

The creature&#x27;s nature was described by Walter Gregor, a folklorist and one of the first members of the Folklore Society, as &quot;useful&quot;, &quot;hurtful&quot;, or seeking &quot;human companionship&quot;; in some cases, kelpies take their victims into the water, devour them, and throw the entrails to the water&#x27;s edge. In its equine form the kelpie is able to extend the length of its back to carry many riders together into the depths; a common theme in the tales is of several children clambering onto the creature&#x27;s back while one remains on the shore. Usually a little boy, he then pets the horse but his hand sticks to its neck. In some variations the lad cuts off his fingers or hand to free himself; he survives but the other children are carried off and drowned, with only some of their entrails being found later. Such a creature said to inhabit Glen Keltney in Perthshire is considered to be a kelpie by 20th-century folklorist Katharine Mary Briggs, but a similar tale also set in Perthshire has an &quot;each uisge&quot; as the culprit and omits the embellishment of the young boy. The lad does cut his finger off when the event takes place in Thurso, where a water kelpie is identified as the culprit. The same tale set at Sunart in the Highlands gives a specific figure of nine children lost, of whom only the innards of one are recovered. The surviving boy is again saved by cutting off his finger, and the additional information is given that he had a Bible in his pocket. Gregorson Campbell considers the creature responsible to have been a water horse rather than a kelpie, and the tale &quot;obviously a pious fraud to keep children from wandering on Sundays&quot;.

Kelpie myths usually describe a solitary creature, but a fairy story recorded by John F. Campbell in &quot;Popular Tales of the West Highlands&quot; (1860) has a different perspective. Entitled &quot;Of the Drocht na Vougha or Fuoah&quot;, which is given the translation &quot;of the bridge of the fairies or kelpies&quot;, it features a group of voughas. The spirits had set about constructing a bridge over the Dornoch Firth after becoming tired of travelling across the water in cockleshells. It was a magnificent piece of work resplendent with gold piers and posts, but sank into the water to become a treacherous area of quicksand after a grateful onlooker tried to bless the kelpies for their work. The same story is recorded by Folklore Society member and folklore collector Charlotte Dempster simply as &quot;The Kelpie&#x27;s Bridge&quot; (1888) with no mention of Voughas or Fuoah. Quoting the same narrative Jennifer Westwood, author and folklorist, uses the descriptor &quot;water kelpies&quot;, adding that in her opinion &quot;Kelpies, here and in a few other instances, is used in a loose sense to mean something like &#x27;imps.

Progeny resulting from a mating between a kelpie and a normal horse were impossible to drown, and could be recognised by their shorter than normal ears, a characteristic shared by the mythical water bull or &quot;tarbh uisge&quot; in Scottish Gaelic, similar to the Manx &quot;tarroo ushtey&quot;.

===Shapeshifting===
Kelpies have the ability to transform themselves into non-equine forms, and can take on the outward appearance of human figures, in which guise they may betray themselves by the presence of water weeds in their hair. Gregor described a kelpie adopting the guise of a wizened old man continually muttering to himself while sitting on a bridge stitching a pair of trousers. Believing it to be a kelpie, a passing local struck it on the head, causing it to revert to its equine form and scamper back to its lair in a nearby pond. Other accounts describe the kelpie when appearing in human form as a &quot;rough, shaggy man who leaps behind a solitary rider, gripping and crushing him&quot;, or as tearing apart and devouring humans.

A folk tale from Barra tells of a lonely kelpie that transforms itself into a handsome young man to woo a pretty young girl it was determined to take for its wife. But the girl recognises the young man as a kelpie and removes his silver necklace (his bridle) while he sleeps. The kelpie immediately reverts to its equine form, and the girl takes it home to her father&#x27;s farm, where it is put to work for a year. At the end of that time the girl rides the kelpie to consult a wise man, who tells her to return the silver necklace. The wise man then asks the kelpie, once again transformed into the handsome young man the girl had first met, whether if given the choice it would choose to be a kelpie or a mortal. The kelpie in turn asks the girl whether, if he were a man, she would agree to be his wife. She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become a mortal man, and the pair are married.

Traditionally, kelpies in their human form are male. One of the few stories describing the creature in female form is set at Conon House in Ross and Cromarty. It tells of a &quot;tall woman dressed in green&quot;, with a &quot;withered, meagre countenance, ever distorted by a malignant scowl&quot;, who overpowered and drowned a man and a boy after she jumped out of a stream.

The arrival of Christianity in Scotland in the 6th century resulted in some folk stories and beliefs being recorded by scribes, usually Christian monks, instead of being perpetuated by word of mouth. Some accounts state that the kelpie retains its hooves even in human form, leading to its association with the Christian notion of Satan, just as with the Greek god Pan. Robert Burns refers to such a Satanic association in his &quot;Address to the Devil&quot; (1786):
===Capture and killing===
When a kelpie appeared in its equine persona without any tack, it could be captured using a halter stamped with the sign of a cross, and its strength could then be harnessed in tasks such as the transportation of heavy mill stones. One folk tale describes how the Laird of Morphie captured a kelpie and used it to carry stones to build his castle. Once the work was complete, the laird released the kelpie, which was evidently unhappy about its treatment. The curse it issued before leaving – &quot;Sair back and sair banes/ Drivin&#x27; the Laird o&#x27; Morphies&#x27;s stanes,/ The Laird o&#x27; Morphie&#x27;ll never thrive/ As lang&#x27;s the kelpy is alive&quot; – (Sore back and sore bones/ Driving the Lord of Morphie&#x27;s stones,/ The Lord of Morphie will never thrive/ As long as the kelpie is alive) was popularly believed to have resulted in the extinction of the laird&#x27;s family. Some kelpies were said to be equipped with a bridle and sometimes a saddle, and appeared invitingly ready to ride, but if mounted they would run off and drown their riders. If the kelpie was already wearing a bridle, exorcism might be achieved by removing it. A bridle taken from a kelpie was endowed with magical properties, and if brandished towards someone, was able to transform that person into a horse or pony.

Just as with cinematic werewolves, a kelpie can be killed by being shot with a silver bullet, after which it is seen to consist of nothing more than &quot;turf and a soft mass like jelly-fish&quot; according to an account published by Spence. When a blacksmith&#x27;s family were being frightened by the repeated appearances of a water kelpie at their summer cottage, the blacksmith managed to render it into a &quot;heap of starch, or something like it&quot; by penetrating the spirit&#x27;s flanks with two sharp iron spears that had been heated in a fire.

==Loch Ness==

Almost every sizeable Scottish body of water has a kelpie story associated with it, but the most widely reported is the kelpie of Loch Ness. Several stories of mythical spirits and monsters are attached to the loch&#x27;s vicinity, dating back to 6th-century reports of Saint Columba defeating a monster on the banks of the River Ness. The early 19th-century kelpie that haunted the woods and shores of Loch Ness was tacked up with its own saddle and bridle. A fable attached to the notoriously nasty creature has the Highlander James MacGrigor taking it by surprise and cutting off its bridle, the source of its power and life, without which it would die within twenty-four hours. As the kelpie had the power of speech, it attempted unsuccessfully to bargain with MacGrigor for the return of its bridle. After following MacGrigor to his home, the kelpie asserted that MacGrigor would be unable to enter his house while in possession of the bridle, because of the presence of a cross above the entrance door. But MacGrigor outwitted the creature by tossing the bridle through a window, so the kelpie accepted its fate and left, cursing and swearing. The myth is perpetuated with further tales of the bridle as it is passed down through the family. Referred to as &quot;Willox&#x27;s Ball and Bridle&quot;, it had magical powers of healing; a spell was made by placing the items in water while chanting &quot;In the name of the Father, the Son and of the Holy Ghost&quot;; the water could then be used as a cure.

A popular and more recent explanation for the Loch Ness monster among believers is that it belongs to a line of long-surviving plesiosaurs, but the kelpie myth still survives in children&#x27;s books such as Mollie Hunter&#x27;s &quot;The Kelpie&#x27;s Pearls&quot; (1966) and Dick King-Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Water Horse&quot; (1990).

==Origins==
According to Derek Gath Whitley (1911), the association with horses may have its roots in horse sacrifices performed in ancient Scandinavia. Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping children away from perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent women to be wary of attractive young strangers. The stories were also used to enforce moral standards, as they implied that the creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays. The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or turbulent water.

Historian and symbologist Charles Milton Smith has hypothesised that the kelpie myth might originate with the water spouts that can form over the surface of Scottish lochs, giving the impression of a living form as they move across the water. Sir Walter Scott alludes to a similar explanation in his epic poem &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; (1810), which contains the lines
 in which Scott uses &quot;River Demon&quot; to denote a &quot;kelpy&quot;. Scott may also have hinted at an alternative rational explanation by naming a treacherous area of quicksand &quot;Kelpie&#x27;s Flow&quot; in his novel &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot; (1818).
==Artistic representations==
Pictish stones dating from the 6th to 9th centuries featuring what has been dubbed the Pictish Beast may be the earliest representations of a kelpie or kelpie-like creature.

Victorian artist Thomas Millie Dow sketched the kelpie in 1895 as a melancholy dark-haired maiden balanced on a rock, a common depiction for artists of the period. Other depictions show kelpies as poolside maidens, as in Draper&#x27;s 1913 oil on canvas. Folklorist Nicola Bown has suggested that painters such as Millie Dow and Draper deliberately ignored earlier accounts of the kelpie and reinvented it by altering its sex and nature.

Two steel sculptures in Falkirk on the Forth and Clyde Canal, named &quot;The Kelpies&quot;, borrow the name of the mythical creature to associate with the strength and endurance of the horse; designed by sculptor Andy Scott, they were built as monuments to Scotland&#x27;s horse-powered industrial heritage. Construction was completed in October 2013 and the sculptures were opened for public access from April 2014.

<text>Margery Louise Allingham (20 May 1904 – 30 June 1966) was an English novelist from the &quot;Golden Age of Detective Fiction&quot;, and considered one of its four &quot;Queens of Crime&quot;, alongside Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers and Ngaio Marsh. 

Allingham is best remembered for her hero, the gentleman sleuth Albert Campion. Initially believed to be a parody of Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27;s detective Lord Peter Wimsey, Campion matured into a strongly individual character, part-detective, part-adventurer, who formed the basis for 18 novels and many short stories.

==Early life ==

Margery Louise Allingham was born on 20 May 1904 in Ealing, London, the eldest daughter of Herbert Allingham (1868–1936) and Emily Jane ( Hughes; 1879–1960). She had a younger brother Philip William, and a younger sister Emily Joyce Allingham, former WRNS member and amateur filmmaker. 

Her family was immersed in literature; her parents were both writers. Her father was editor of the &quot;Christian Globe&quot; and &quot;The New London Journal&quot;, to which Margery later contributed articles and Sexton Blake stories, and he had become a successful pulp fiction writer, and her mother, as Emmie Allingham, was a contributor of stories to women&#x27;s magazines, including &quot;The Exploits of Phinella Martin&quot;, stories of a lady detective which ran in &quot;Woman&#x27;s Weekly&quot; from 1915 to 1920. 

Soon after Margery&#x27;s birth the family left London for Essex, where they lived in an old house in Layer Breton, a village near Colchester. 

She attended a local school and then the Perse School for Girls in Cambridge, all the while writing stories and plays. She earned her first fee at the age of eight, for a story printed in her aunt&#x27;s magazine.

Upon returning to London in 1920 she studied drama and speech training at Regent Street Polytechnic, which helped her manage a stammer which she had since childhood. At this time she first met her future husband, Philip Youngman Carter, whom she married in 1927. He collaborated with her and designed the jackets for many of her books. They lived on the edge of the Essex Marshes in Tolleshunt D&#x27;Arcy, near Maldon.

==Career==
===Early writings===
While she was enrolled at the Regent Street Polytechnic she wrote a verse play, &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;, which was performed at St. George&#x27;s Hall, London, and the Cripplegate Theatre, London. Allingham played the role of Dido and the scenery was designed by Philip Youngman Carter.
Her first novel, &quot;Blackkerchief Dick&quot;, was published in 1923, when she was 19. It was allegedly based on a story she had heard during a séance, though later in life this was debunked by her husband. Nevertheless, Allingham continued to include occult themes in many of her novels. &quot;Blackkerchief Dick&quot; was well received, but was not a financial success. She wrote several plays in this period and attempted to write a serious novel, but finding that her themes clashed with her natural light-heartedness, she decided instead to try the mystery genre.

===Campion and success===
Her breakthrough occurred in 1929 with the publication of &quot;The Crime at Black Dudley&quot;. This introduced Albert Campion, initially as a minor character, thought to be a parody of Dorothy Sayers’s Lord Peter Wimsey. Campion returned in &quot;Mystery Mile&quot;, thanks in part to pressure from her American publishers, who had been taken with the character.

With a strong central character and a format to work in, she began to produce a series of Campion novels. At first she also continued writing short stories and articles for magazines such as &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, but as her Campion saga went on her sales grew steadily. Campion proved so successful that Allingham made him the centrepiece of another 17 novels and more than 20 short stories, continuing into the 1960s. 

Campion is a mysterious upper-class character (early novels hint that his family is in the line of succession to the throne), working under an assumed name. He floats between the upper echelons of the nobility and government on the one hand, and the shady world of the criminal class on the other, often accompanied by his scurrilous ex-burglar servant Magersfontein Lugg. During the course of his career Campion is sometimes a detective, sometimes an adventurer.

The first three Campion novels, &quot;The Crime at Black Dudley&quot;, &quot;Mystery Mile&quot; and &quot;Look to the Lady&quot;, were all written by what Allingham referred to as the &quot;plum pudding&quot; method, focused less on methods of murder or the formal strictures of the whodunit and more on mixing possibilities together. As the series progresses, however, Campion comes to work more closely with the police and MI6 counter-intelligence. He also falls in love, gets married and has a child, and as time goes by he grows in wisdom and matures emotionally.

The style and format of the books moved on: while the early novels are light-hearted whodunnits or &quot;fantastical&quot; adventures, &quot;The Tiger in the Smoke&quot; (1952) is more a character study than a crime novel, focusing on the serial killer Jack Havoc. In many of the later books Campion plays a subsidiary role, no more prominent than the roles of his wife Amanda and his police associates, and in the last novel he is a minor character.

In 1941 Allingham published a non-fiction work, &quot;The Oaken Heart&quot;, which describes her experiences in Essex when an invasion from Germany was expected and actively being planned for, potentially placing the civilian population of Essex in the front line.

==Death==
Allingham suffered from breast cancer and died at Severalls Hospital, Colchester, England, on 30 June 1966, aged 62. Her final Campion novel, &quot;Cargo of Eagles&quot;, was completed by her husband at her request, and was published in 1968. She was cared for through her illness by her sister, who avoided the topic in her films depicting their home life as well as ensuring her husband was not inconvenienced by it.

Compilations of her work, both with and without Albert Campion, continued to be released through the 1970s. The &quot;Margery Allingham Omnibus&quot;, comprising &quot;Sweet Danger&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Late Pig&quot; and &quot;The Tiger in the Smoke&quot;, with a critical introduction by Jane Stevenson, was published in 2006.

Allingham was buried in the newer cemetery in Tolleshunt D&#x27;Arcy.

==Legacy==
A film version of &quot;The Tiger in the Smoke&quot; was made in 1956 (though Campion does not appear in the movie), and a highly popular series of Campion adaptations was shown by the BBC in 1989–90. It is titled simply &quot;Campion&quot; and stars Peter Davison as Campion and Brian Glover as Lugg.

Several books have been written about Allingham and her work, including:
* &quot;Margery Allingham: 100 Years of a Great Mystery Writer&quot; edited by Marianne van Hoeven (2003)
* &quot;Margery Allingham: A Biography&quot; by Julia Thorogood (1991); revised as &quot;The Adventures of Margery Allingham&quot; as by Julia Jones (2009). 
* &quot;Ink in Her Blood: The Life and Crime Fiction of Margery Allingham&quot; by Richard Martin (1988)
* &quot;Campion&#x27;s Career: A Study of the Novels of Margery Allingham&quot; by B.A. Pike (1987)

Further Campion adventures have been written by Mike Ripley. The first of these, &quot;Mr Campion&#x27;s Farewell&quot;, was based on notes left at his death by Allingham&#x27;s husband Philip Youngman Carter; all the rest have been originals.

<text>Michael Joseph &quot;Mickey Joe&quot; Harte (born 21 August 1973), is an Irish singer-songwriter. He represented Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2003 with the song &quot;We&#x27;ve Got the World&quot;.

==Early life==
Harte hails from Lifford, County Donegal. As a teenager during the 1980s Harte had an epiphany – &quot;Because the moment I lifted a guitar and wrote my first song I knew I was creative&quot;, he has said. He started playing guitar at the age of 13. His first song, called &quot;Candlelight&quot;, was inspired by Operation Desert Storm, the 1991 U.S invasion of Iraq. He later paid for the recording of his first extended play (EP). His mother, a poet, has had her work set to music by her son.

==Career==

Harte entered the Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) television show &quot;You&#x27;re a Star in 2002.&quot; The show set records for Irish TV ratings over the period of November 2002 to March 2003 and Harte came out on top, earning the opportunity to represent Ireland at Eurovision Song Contest 2003 in Riga. In Riga he performed &quot;We&#x27;ve Got the World&quot; (written by Martin Brannigan and Keith Molloy). He finished in eleventh place in the competition. &quot;We&#x27;ve Got the World&quot; reached number one on the Irish Singles Chart.

In 2003, Harte recorded a cover version of Beyoncé&#x27;s &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; for &quot;Even Better than the Real Thing Vol. 1&quot;, and in 2004 a cover version of Eamon&#x27;s &quot;Fuck It (I Don&#x27;t Want You Back)&quot; (albeit without the &quot;Fuck It&quot; part).

In 2006, Harte released his second studio album, &quot;Live and Learn&quot;.

In 2007, Harte appeared on &quot;Celebrities Go Wild&quot;, an RTÉ reality television show in which eight celebrities had to fend for themselves in the wilds of rural Connemara.

In 2011, Harte released his third album &quot;Forward to Reality&quot;. The album was recorded in Chicago (USA) and produced by John Condron.

He performed at Croke Park during half-time in the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship semi-final between Cork and Donegal. After Donegal won the Sam Maguire Cup the next month, he performed at their homecoming in Donegal.

In 2016 he played Louise Ryan &amp; Úna O Boyle&#x27;s birthday party to a rapt 
 audience of 60 friends and family on a boat on the river Liffey, Dublin. He also played surprise set for close fans such as Robert Smith in a local Dublin nightclub in late 2016.

Mickey recorded some new material in Bedburg (Germany) which will hopefully released in Autumn 2016. In September he opened up the &quot;12. Musikmeile Bedburg&quot; as support act for singer-songwriter Milow (30,000 people attending the festival).

Mickey&#x27;s single &quot;For the Broken Hearted&quot; was released on 5 October 2017. The song was recorded in Bedburg, Germany and produced by Dieter Kirchenbauer.

In late 2024, Harte was confirmed as a contestant in the upcoming eight series of the Irish dancing show Dancing with the Stars, which began airing in January 2025. He danced with new professional dancer Daniela Roze. Harte and Roze were eliminated first in the third week of the programme.

==Personal life==
Harte is married to Louise Harte. The couple have four children: Kayleigh, Kyle, Percy and Cristian.

<text>Claude Charles Fauriel (; 21 October 1772 – 15 July 1844) was a French historian, philologist and critic.

==Biography==
He was born at Saint-Étienne, Loire, the son of a poor joiner, but received a good education in the Oratorian colleges of Tournon and Lyon. He was twice in the army—at Perpignan in 1793, and in 1796–1797 at Briançon, as private secretary to General J Servan de Gerbey (1741–1808); but he preferred the civil service and the companionship of his friends and his books. In 1794 he returned to St Etienne, where, but only for a short period, he filled a municipal office; and from 1797 to 1799 he devoted himself to strenuous study, more especially of the literature and history, both ancient and modern, of Greece and Italy. Having paid a visit to Paris in 1799, he was introduced to Joseph Fouché, minister of police, becoming his private secretary. Though he discharged the duties of this office to Fouché&#x27;s satisfaction, his strength was worn out by study, and in 1801 he was forced to take a three-month trip in the south. His health also resulted in his resigning his office in the following year, though his actions also had something to do with his scruples about serving longer under Napoleon, when the latter, in violation of his declared republican principles, became consul for life. This is clearly shown by the fragments of &quot;Mémoirs&quot; discovered by Ludovic Lalanne and published in 1886.

Some articles which Fauriel published in the &quot;Decade philosophique&quot; (1800) on a work of Madame de Staël&#x27;s—&quot;De la littérature considerée dans ses rapports avec les institutions sociales&quot;—led to friendship with her. The salon of Mme de Condorcet was a rallying point for the dissentient republicans. Fauriel was introduced by Madame de Staël to the literary circle of Auteuil, which gathered round Antoine Destutt de Tracy. Those who enjoyed his closest intimacy were the physiologist Cabanis (Madame de Condorcet&#x27;s brother-in-law), the poet Alessandro Manzoni, the publicist Benjamin Constant, and François Guizot. Later Destutt de Tracy introduced to him Augustin Thierry (1821) and perhaps Adolphe Thiers and François Mignet.

He began a relationship with the Marquis de Condorcet&#x27;s widow, Sophie, in 1801, and lived openly with her until 1822, when she died.

In June 1822 the intellectual Mary Clarke and her mother visited England and Scotland. Fauriel revealed his interest in her when he wrote to Mary concerning Auguste Sirey who had been spoken of as Mary&#x27;s fiancé. It had been proposed that Sirey would go to England with them. Mary would eventually marry Julius von Mohl.

During his connection with Auteuil, Fauriel&#x27;s attention turned to philosophy, and he began work on a history of Stoicism, which was never completed, all the papers connected with it having accidentally perished in 1814. He also studied Arabic, Sanskrit and the old South French dialects. He published in 1810 a translation of the &quot;Parthenais&quot; of the Danish poet Baggesen, with a preface on the various kinds of poetry; in 1823 translations of two tragedies of Manzoni, with a preface &quot;&quot;Sur la théorie de l&#x27;art dramatique&quot;; and in 1824-1825 his translation of the popular songs of modern Greece, with a &quot;Discours préliminaire&quot;&quot; on popular poetry.

The revolution of July, which put his friends in power, opened to him the career of higher education. In 1830 he became professor of foreign literature at the Sorbonne. The &quot;Histoire de la Gaule méridionale sous la domination des conquerants germains&quot; (4 vols., 1836) was the only completed section of a general history of southern France which he had projected. In 1836 he was elected a member of the Academy of Inscriptions, and in 1837 he published (with an introduction the conclusions of which would not now all be endorsed) a translation of a Provençal poem on the Albigensian war. After his death his friend Mary Clarke (afterwards Madame J. Möhl) published his &quot;Histoire de la poésie provençale&quot; (3 vols., 1846)--his lectures for 1831–1832. Fauriel had a preconceived and somewhat fanciful theory that Provence was the cradle of the &quot;chansons de geste&quot; and even of the Round Table romances; but he gave a great stimulus to the scientific study of Old French and Provençal. &quot;Dante et les engines de la langue et de la littérature italiennes&quot; (2 vols.) was published in 1854.

Fauriel&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires&quot;, found with Condorcet&#x27;s papers, are in the Institute library. They were written at latest in 1804, and include some interesting fragments on the close of the consulate, Moreau, etc. Though anonymous, Lalanne, who published them (&quot;Les Derniers Jours du Consulat&quot;, 1886), proved them to be in the same handwriting as a letter of Fauriel&#x27;s in 1803.

<text>The Giver is a 1993 American young adult dystopian novel written by Lois Lowry and is set in a society which at first appears to be utopian but is revealed to be dystopian as the story progresses. 

In the novel, the society has taken away pain and strife by converting to &quot;Sameness&quot;, a plan that has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives. In an effort to preserve order, the society has a true sense of equality and lacks any color, climate, or terrain. The protagonist of the story, a 12-year-old boy named Jonas, is selected to inherit the position of Receiver of Memory, the person who stores all the memories of the time before Sameness. Jonas struggles with concepts of the new emotions and things introduced to him, and whether they are inherently good, evil, or in between, and whether it is possible to have one without the other.

&quot;The Giver&quot; won the 1994 Newbery Medal and has sold more than 12 million copies worldwide. A 2012 survey by &quot;School Library Journal&quot; designated it as the fourth-best children&#x27;s novel of all time. It has been the subject of a large body of scholarly analysis, with academics considering themes of memory, religion, color, eugenics and utopia within the novel. In Australia, Canada, and the United States, it is required on many core curriculum reading lists in middle school, but it is also frequently challenged. It ranked #11 on the American Library Association list of the most challenged books of the 1990s, ranked #23 in the 2000s, and ranked #61 in the 2010s.

The novel is the first in a loose quartet of novels known as &quot;The Giver Quartet&quot;, with three subsequent books set in the same universe: &quot;Gathering Blue&quot; (2000), &quot;Messenger&quot; (2004), and &quot;Son&quot; (2012). In 2014, a film adaptation was released, starring Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, and Brenton Thwaites and directed by Philip Noyce.

==Plot==
Jonas, a 12-year-old boy, lives in a community isolated from all except a few similar towns, where everyone has an assigned role. With the annual Ceremony of Twelve upcoming, he is nervous, for there he will be assigned his life&#x27;s work. He seeks reassurance from his father, a Nurturer (who cares for the infants in the Community) and his mother, an official in the Department of Justice. He is told that the Elders, who assign the children their careers, are always right.

The day finally arrives, and Jonas is assembled with his classmates in order of birth. The Chief Elder, who presides, initially passes over Jonas&#x27;s turn and at the ceremony&#x27;s conclusion explains that Jonas has not been given a normal assignment, but instead has been selected as the next Receiver of Memory. The position of Receiver has high status and responsibility, and Jonas quickly finds himself growing distant from his classmates. The rules Jonas receives further separate him, as they allow him no time to play with his friends and require him to keep his training secret. They also allow him to lie and withhold his feelings from his family, things generally not allowed in the regimented Community.

Once he begins it, Jonas&#x27;s training makes clear his uniqueness, for the Receiver of Memory is just that—a person who bears the burden of the memories from all of history, and who is the only one allowed access to books beyond schoolbooks and the rulebook issued to every household. The current Receiver, who asks Jonas to call him the Giver, begins the process of transferring those memories to Jonas, for the ordinary person in the Community knows nothing of the past. These memories, and being the only Community member allowed access to books about the past, give the Receiver perspective to advise the Council of Elders. The first memory is of sliding down a snow-covered hill on a sled, pleasantness made shocking by the fact that Jonas has never seen a sled, or snow, or a hill—for the memories of even these things have been given up to assure security and conformity (called Sameness). Even color has been surrendered, and the Giver shows Jonas a rainbow. Less pleasantly, he gives Jonas memories of hunger and war, things alien to the boy. Hanging over Jonas&#x27;s training is the fact that the Giver once before had an apprentice, named Rosemary, but the boy finds his parents and the Giver reluctant to discuss what happened to her.

Jonas&#x27;s father is concerned about an infant at the Nurturing Center who is failing to thrive and has received special permission to bring him home at night. The baby&#x27;s name will be Gabriel if he grows strong enough to be assigned to a family. He has pale eyes, like Jonas and the Giver. Jonas grows attached to him, especially when Jonas finds that he can receive memories. If Gabriel does not increase in strength, he will be &quot;released from the Community&quot;—in common speech, taken Elsewhere. This has happened to an off-course air pilot, to chronic rule breakers, to elderly people, and to the apprentice Rosemary. After Jonas speculates about life in Elsewhere, the Giver educates him by showing the boy hidden-camera video of Jonas&#x27;s father doing his job: releasing the smaller of two identical twin newborns through lethal injection before putting it in a trash chute, since identical community members are forbidden. There is no Elsewhere for those not wanted by the Community—those said to have been &quot;released&quot; have been killed.

Since he now considers his father a murderer, Jonas initially refuses to return home, but the Giver convinces him that without the memories, the people of the Community cannot know that what they have been trained to do is wrong. Rosemary was unable to endure the darker memories of the past and instead killed herself with the poison. Jonas and the Giver devise a plan to return the community&#x27;s memories so they may know where they have gone wrong. Both agree that Jonas will leave the community thereby returning the memories to them, while the Giver will stay to help them learn to live with their memories before joining his daughter, Rosemary, in death. They plan to fake Jonas&#x27;s drowning to limit the search for him, but he instead must escape in a rush with Gabriel, upon learning of the child&#x27;s imminent release. The two are near death from cold and starvation when they reach the border of what Jonas believes must be Elsewhere. Using his ability to &quot;see beyond&quot;, a gift that he does not quite understand, he finds a sled waiting for him at the top of a snowy hill. He and Gabriel ride the sled down towards a house filled with colored lights and warmth and love and a Christmas tree, and for the first time he hears something he believes must be music. The ending is ambiguous, with Jonas depicted as experiencing symptoms of hypothermia. This leaves his and Gabriel&#x27;s future unresolved. However, their fate is revealed in &quot;Messenger&quot; and &quot;Son&quot;, companion novels written years later.

In 2009, at the National Book Festival, the author joked during a Q&amp;A: &quot;Jonas is alive, by the way. You don&#x27;t need to ask that question.&quot;

== Background == 
Lowry has stated that her books all explore &quot;the importance of human connection… the vital need for humans to be aware of their interdependence, not only with each other, but with the world and its environment.&quot; Like Lowry&#x27;s other books, &quot;The Giver&quot; shows changes in the characters&#x27; lives, reflecting this fascination in the multifaceted dimensions of growing up.

&quot;The Giver&quot; was initially inspired by Lowry&#x27;s interaction with her father, who, in his senility, kept forgetting about the long-ago death of her sister; she imagined &quot;a novel in which people are deprived of the memories of suffering, grief, and pain.&quot; She based the novel&#x27;s setting in part on the closely guarded army bases in which she had grown up, her father having been an army dentist. She has stated, of the characters in &quot;The Giver&quot;, they have lived in a sterile world for so long that they are in danger of losing the real emotions that make them human.

== Analysis of themes ==

=== Memory ===
Bradford et al. argue that &quot;The Giver&quot; represents a community where the lack of cultural memory leads to an inability to avoid societal mistakes, preventing the community from becoming a true Utopia, thus conferring transformational potential on human memory. Hanson interprets the restriction of memory as totalitarian and argues that Lowry demonstrates the emancipatory potential of memory in &quot;The Giver&quot;. Triplett and Han suggest that Jonas&#x27;s role as receiver of memory, allowing him a deeper understanding of his societal and cultural context, demonstrates the validity of suspicious methods of reading that attempt to obtain deeper rather than surface meanings.

=== Religion ===
Bradford et al. suggest &quot;The Giver&quot;″s depiction of Christmas at the novel&#x27;s end implies that an ideal community is in part represented by a family Christmas, therefore situating the novel as conservative. Graeme Wend-Walker, an academic, analyzed the then-trilogy in 2013 through a post-secular lens and suggested that removing religion entirely from human society and lives could diminish humanity&#x27;s capacity for accepting differences rather than providing for human liberation as some may assume. Countering Bradford&#x27;s claim, which would suggest that the novel is conservative rather than transformative due to its religious imagery and undertones, Wend-Walker&#x27;s post-secular reading suggests that the novel explores the ambiguity between the secular and religious binary which provides it progressive potential by allowing for the transformative potential of the spiritual.

=== Color ===
Susan G. Lea has emphasized that sameness is crucial to the world of &quot;The Giver&quot;, and furthermore that their monochromatic vision creates a color blindness within the community that cannot be aware of the effects of the absence of color. She likens the lack of difference and literal color blindness of &quot;The Giver&quot;″s community with color blind attitudes that act as if racial difference does not exist, and suggests that the book shows the way that colorblindness erases people of color and their experiences through their lack of visibility. Kyoungmin and Lee examine Jonas&#x27;s growing ability to see color rather than the lack of color in his community and argue that his selfhood grows as his memory and perception of color grow. They suggest that Jonas&#x27;s full perception of color at the end is what allows him to choose to travel elsewhere as an autonomous agent in comparison to others in his community.

=== Eugenics and gene editing ===
Elizabeth Bridges reads an implication of gene editing in the development of the homogenous community, based on euphemistic language throughout the novel. She suggests that the release of those who do not fit societal conventions represents the ways that eugenics were employed by the society of &quot;The Giver&quot;. Robert Gadowski suggests that government control of bodies inhibits the society&#x27;s freedoms. He argues that through bio-technical planning, people&#x27;s bodies become vehicles of state control rather than the locus of their autonomy.

==Literary significance and reception==
In the United States, &quot;The Giver&quot; has become frequently assigned as reading in schools, as well as library-sponsored reading clubs and &quot;City Reads&quot; programs.

However, reviewers have commented that the story lacks originality and is not likely to stand up to the sort of probing literary criticism used in &quot;serious&quot; circles. Others argue that the book&#x27;s appeal to a young-adult audience is critical for building a developing reader&#x27;s appetite for reading. Karen Ray, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, detects &quot;occasional logical lapses&quot;, but adds that the book &quot;is sure to keep older children reading&quot;. Young adult fiction author Debra Doyle was more critical, stating that &quot;Personal taste aside, &quot;The Giver&quot; fails the [science fiction] Plausibility Test,&quot; and that &quot;Things are the way they are [in the novel] because The Author is Making A Point; things work out the way they do because The Author&#x27;s Point Requires It.&quot;

Children&#x27;s author Natalie Babbitt, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the novel &quot;a warning in narrative form,&quot; saying: &quot;The story has been told before in a variety of forms—Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; comes to mind—but not, to my knowledge, for children. It&#x27;s well worth telling, especially by a writer of Lowry&#x27;s great skill. If it is exceedingly fragile—if, in other words, some situations do not survive that well-known suspension of disbelief—well, so be it. &quot;The Giver&quot; has things to say that cannot be said too often, and I hope there will be many, many young people who will be willing to listen. A review in &quot;The Horn Book Magazine&quot; stated, &quot;In a departure from her well-known and favorably regarded realistic works, Lois Lowry has written a fascinating, thoughtful science-fiction novel... The story is skillfully written; the air of disquiet is delicately insinuated. And the theme of balancing the virtues of freedom and security is beautifully presented.&quot;

=== Censorship in the United States ===
&quot;The Giver&quot; has been a frequent subject of bans, or attempted bans, in school libraries, due to its dark themes and violence. In a 2020 question-and-session, Lowry stated that the calls for banning have usually come from parents and others who have not read the book, but only seen descriptions or out-of-context quotes; and that those who have called for its banning have usually changed their mind after reading it. Lowry has stated that she is against any censorship, and that no literature should be considered off-limits. Some have noted the irony of wanting to censor a novel that warns about societal control of children.

==Awards, nominations, and recognition==

Lowry won many awards for her work on &quot;The Giver&quot;, including the following:
* The 1994 Newbery Medal – The John Newbery award (Medal) is given by the Association for Library Service to Children. The award is given for the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children.
* The 1994 Regina Medal
* The 1996 William Allen White Award
* American Library Association listings for &quot;Best Book for Young Adults&quot;, &quot;ALA Notable Children&#x27;s Book&quot;, and &quot;100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000.&quot;
* A Boston Globe-Horn Book Honor Book
* Booklist Editors&#x27; Choice
* A &quot;School Library Journal&quot; Best Book of the Year

A 2004 study found that &quot;The Giver&quot; was a common read-aloud book for sixth-graders in schools in San Diego County, California. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed it as one of &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;. In 2012 it was ranked number four among all-time children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Oregon Children&#x27;s Theatre (Portland, Oregon) premiered a stage adaptation of &quot;The Giver&quot; by Eric Coble in March 2006. Subsequent productions of Coble&#x27;s one-hour script have been presented in several American theatres.

Another stage adaptation, written by Diana Basmajian, was produced by Prime Stage Theatre in 2006.

Actor Ron Rifkin reads the text for the audiobook edition.

The Lyric Opera of Kansas City and the Minnesota Opera co-commissioned and premiered an opera by Susan Kander based on the novel. It was presented in Kansas City in January and Minneapolis on April 27–29, 2012, and was webcast on May 18, 2012.

In 2017, a stage musical adaptation was in the development stages, with a book by Martin Zimmerman and music and lyrics by Jonah Platt and Andrew Resnick.

HMH Books for Young Readers published a comic book adaptation in spring 2019 illustrated and adapted by Eisner and Harvey Award winner P. Craig Russell.

===Film adaptation===

In the fall of 1994, actor Bill Cosby and his ASIS Productions film company established an agreement with Lancit Media Productions to adapt &quot;The Giver&quot; to film. In the years following, members of the partnership changed and the production team grew in size, but little motion was seen toward making the film. At one point, screenwriter Ed Neumeier was signed to create the screenplay. Later, Neumeier was replaced by Todd Alcott and Walden Media became the central production company.

Jeff Bridges has said he had wanted to make the film for nearly 20 years, and originally wanted to direct it with his father Lloyd Bridges in the title role. The elder Bridges&#x27; 1998 death cancelled that plan and the film languished in development hell for another 15 years. Warner Bros. bought the rights in 2007 and the film adaptation was finally given the green light in December 2012. Jeff Bridges plays the title character with Brenton Thwaites in the role of Jonas. Meryl Streep, Katie Holmes, Odeya Rush, Cameron Monaghan, Alexander Skarsgård and Taylor Swift round out the rest of the main cast. It was released in North America on August 15, 2014.
