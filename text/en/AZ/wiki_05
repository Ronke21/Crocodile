<text>Wayne Mark Rooney (born 24 October 1985) is an English professional football manager and former player who was most recently the head coach of EFL Championship club Plymouth Argyle. Widely considered one of the best players of his generation and one of the greatest British players of all time, Rooney is the record goalscorer for Manchester United, and was the record goalscorer for the England national team from 2015 to 2023. He has also made more appearances for England than any other outfield player. Rooney spent most of his playing career as a forward, but was also used in various midfield roles.

Rooney joined the Everton youth team at the age of nine and made his professional debut for the club in 2002 at the age of 16. He spent two seasons at the Merseyside club before moving to Manchester United for £25.6 million in the 2004 summer transfer window, where he won 16 trophies and became one of only two English players, alongside teammate Michael Carrick, to win the Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, League Cup, UEFA Europa League, and FIFA Club World Cup. He scored 253 goals for United in all competitions, making him the club&#x27;s top goalscorer of all time; his 183 Premier League goals for United is the third-most scored by a player in that competition for any single club, behind only Harry Kane (213 goals for Tottenham Hotspur) and Sergio Agüero (184 goals for Manchester City). Rooney&#x27;s 208 Premier League goals make him the competition&#x27;s third-highest scorer of all time, while he also holds the fourth-highest number of assists with 103.

Rooney made his senior international debut for England in February 2003, aged 17, and is England&#x27;s youngest-ever goalscorer. He played at UEFA Euro 2004 and scored four goals, briefly becoming the youngest goalscorer in the history of the European Championship. Rooney later featured at the 2006, 2010 and 2014 World Cups, and was widely regarded as his country&#x27;s best player. He has won the England Player of the Year award four times, in 2008, 2009, 2014, and 2015. With 53 goals in 120 international caps, Rooney is England&#x27;s second-most-capped player (behind Peter Shilton) and second-top goalscorer.

Rooney won the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year and the FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the 2009–10 season, and he has won the Premier League Player of the Month award five times throughout his career. He came fifth in the vote for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or, and he was named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI for 2011. He won the Goal of the Season award by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day&quot; poll on three occasions, and his February 2011 bicycle kick against city rivals Manchester City won the Premier League 20 Seasons Awards Best Goal award.
== Early life ==
Wayne Mark Rooney was born in the Croxteth area of Liverpool on 24 October 1985, the son of Jeanette Marie ( Morrey) and Thomas Wayne Rooney. He is of Irish descent through his father, and was brought up as a Roman Catholic with his younger brothers Graham and John. He and his brothers attended Our Lady and St Swithin&#x27;s Primary School and De La Salle School. John also later became a footballer. Rooney grew up supporting Everton. He admired Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Rooney stating that &quot;as an out-and-out forward [Ronaldo] was probably the best&quot;.

== Club career ==
=== Everton ===
==== Youth squads ====
Rooney began playing for Liverpool Schoolboys and scored 72 goals in one season, a record which stood until May 2010. At the age of nine, Rooney played for Copplehouse boys&#x27; club in the local Walton and Kirkdale junior league and scored 99 goals in his final season before being spotted by Everton scout Bob Pendleton. Rooney joined Everton at age nine, and was the Everton mascot for the Merseyside derby against Liverpool as an 11-year-old. In the 1995–96 season, he scored 114 goals in 29 games for Everton&#x27;s under-10s and 11s, and by the age of 15, he was playing for the under-19s. He scored eight goals in eight games during Everton&#x27;s run to the FA Youth Cup Final in 2002. This included one goal in the final defeat against Aston Villa and, upon scoring, he revealed a T-shirt that read, &quot;Once a Blue, always a Blue.&quot; Rooney was included in Everton&#x27;s first team squad for their training camp in Austria in the summer of 2002 and scored his first senior goal in a 3–1 friendly victory over SC Weiz on 15 July.

==== First team breakthrough ====

Rooney was an unused substitute in Everton&#x27;s 1–0 away win over Southampton on 20 April 2002. He made his senior debut on 17 August in a 2–2 home draw against Tottenham Hotspur, starting the match and assisting the first goal by Mark Pembridge. He became the second-youngest first-team player in Everton history behind Joe Royle. In that match, he was booed by the Spurs fans who shouted &quot;Who are ya?&quot; whenever he touched the ball. His first senior goals came on 2 October when he scored twice in a 3–0 away win over Wrexham in the second round of the League Cup. These goals meant that Rooney was Everton&#x27;s youngest-ever goalscorer at the time.

On 19 October, five days before his 17th birthday, Rooney scored a last-minute winning goal against Arsenal. The goal ended Arsenal&#x27;s 30-match unbeaten run, and also made Rooney the youngest goalscorer in Premier League history, a record that has since been surpassed by James Milner and James Vaughan. He scored in a 1–0 away win over Leeds United 15 days later.

In December, Rooney was named 2002&#x27;s BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year. Six days after claiming the award he scored the winning goal against Blackburn Rovers in a 2–1 home win. His first career red card came on Boxing Day in a 1–1 away draw against Birmingham City for a late challenge on Steve Vickers. In January 2003, Rooney signed his first professional contract, which made him one of world football&#x27;s highest-paid teenagers. Rooney&#x27;s first goal of 2003 came on 23 March, netting Everton&#x27;s only goal in a 2–1 loss at Arsenal. In April, he scored a goal in Everton&#x27;s 2–1 home win over Newcastle United, before hitting a last-minute winner against Aston Villa in another 2–1 home win. He ended his debut season with eight goals in 37 appearances in all competitions for the Toffees.

Rooney scored his first goal of the 2003–04 season in a 2–2 away draw against Charlton Athletic on 26 August 2003. He did not find the net again until December when he scored in a 2–1 away win over Portsmouth, and a 3–2 home win over Leicester City. His final goal of 2003 came on his 50th league appearance, netting in a 1–0 home win over Birmingham City on 28 December. On 21 February 2004, Rooney scored two goals in a Premier League game for the first time in a 3–3 away draw against Southampton. He scored the sole goal in a 1–0 win over Portsmouth on 13 March, before scoring in a 1–1 away draw against Leicester City one week later. He scored his final goal of the season in a 1–1 away draw against Leeds United on 13 April.

==== 2004–2007: Adapting to the Red Devils ====
In July 2004, Everton offered Rooney a new five-year contract valued at £50,000 per week, the most lucrative ever offered by the club. Amidst increasing speculation linking Rooney with a transfer, Everton chairman Bill Kenwright admitted the club&#x27;s financial situation meant a transfer would &quot;revitalise&quot; the club. Everton rejected a bid of £20 million from Newcastle, and Rooney submitted a transfer request on 27 August, with Moyes saying he would not leave unless the club got the right price for him. He ultimately signed for Manchester United at the end of the month after an initial £20 million deal was reached, with an additional £7 million in contingency payments, with Rooney signing a five-year contract. It was the highest fee ever paid for a player under 20 years old; Rooney was still only 18 when he left Everton. Sir Alex Ferguson, then manager of United, said that &quot;There were plenty of eyebrows raised&quot; when he persuaded the club&#x27;s board of directors to sanction &quot;a multi-million pound&quot; move to try to sign Rooney from Everton. In an appearance on United&#x27;s official podcast in 2020, Rooney revealed Everton had wanted him to sign for Chelsea to ensure a bigger transfer fee, while the mooted transfer to Newcastle would have seen a clause put in place for him to leave after a year to join United.

Rooney was given the number 8 shirt upon his arrival at Old Trafford. He made his United debut on 28 September in a 6–2 home win over Fenerbahçe in the UEFA Champions League, scoring a hat-trick and laying on an assist. His first season with Manchester United, however, ended without winning a trophy as they could only manage a third-place finish in the league, and failed to progress to the last eight of the Champions League. United had more success in the cup competitions, but were edged out of the League Cup in the semi-finals by a Chelsea side who also won the Premier League title that season. Rooney&#x27;s second goal in the FA Cup against Middlesbrough on 29 January 2005, a volley hit with the outside of his right foot from the edge of the 18-yard box, was named BBC Goal of the Season. A goalless draw with Arsenal in the FA Cup final was followed by a penalty shoot-out defeat. Rooney was United&#x27;s top league scorer that season with 11 goals, and was credited with the PFA Young Player of the Year award.

In September 2005, Rooney was sent off in a goalless Champions League match against Villarreal of Spain for sarcastically clapping the referee, who had booked him for an unintentional foul on an opponent. His first trophy with United came in the 2005–06 League Cup, and he was also named man of the match after scoring twice in the final as United won 4–0 against Wigan Athletic. His club finished the season as Premier League runners up, with their title hopes ended in late April when they lost 3–0 away to champions Chelsea. Rooney sustained a broken metatarsal in that game after a tackle from Paulo Ferreira. Rooney scored a total of 16 goals in 26 Premier League games in the 2005–06 season.

Rooney was sent off in the 2006 Amsterdam Tournament match against Porto on 4 August 2006 after hitting Porto defender Pepe with his elbow. He was punished with a three-match ban by the FA, following their receipt of a 23-page report from referee Ruud Bossen that explained his decision. Rooney threatened to withdraw the FA&#x27;s permission to use his image if they did not revoke the ban, although the FA had no power to make such a decision.

During the first half of the 2006–07 season, Rooney endured a ten-game scoreless streak before scoring a hat-trick against Bolton Wanderers. He subsequently signed a two-year contract extension the following month that tied him to United until 2012. In April 2007, Rooney scored and provided an assist for Chris Eagles in a crucial 4–2 league win for Manchester United at his former club Everton, a game that also became notable for Rooney&#x27;s response to fans that once cheered him.

In the same month, Rooney scored two goals in an 8–3 aggregate Champions League quarter-final win over Roma and two more in the same competition at the end of April, in a 3–2 semi-final first leg victory over AC Milan. Rooney collected his first Premier League title winner&#x27;s medal at the end of the 2006–07 season. He scored 14 league goals that season.

==== 2007–2010: The number 10 shirt ====
In June 2007, Rooney was given squad number 10, last worn by Ruud van Nistelrooy. Rooney reasoned that he always loved that number. He fractured his left metatarsal in United&#x27;s opening-day goalless draw against Reading on 12 August, the same injury he had suffered to his right foot in 2004. After being sidelined for six weeks, he returned and scored in United&#x27;s 1–0 Champions League group stage win over Roma on 2 October. On 23 October 2007, Rooney scored in the 4–2 victory over Dynamo Kyiv in the UEFA Champions League, becoming the first player in the history of the club to score 9 goals in Europe at the age of 21 or below. Rooney was again injured on 9 November, hurting his ankle during a training session and missing an additional two weeks. His next match after injury was against Fulham on 3 December, in which he played 70 minutes. Rooney missed ten games and finished the 2007–08 season with 18 goals (12 of them in the league), as United clinched the Premier League. In the Champions League&#x27;s first-ever all-English final, United defeated league rivals Chelsea to win another trophy.

Rooney played in 2008 UEFA Super Cup where United lost to Zenit Saint Petersburg and was unable to make an impact. On 4 October 2008, in an away win over Blackburn, Rooney became the youngest player to make 200 Premier League appearances. On 18 December, Rooney scored twice in the 5–3 semi-final victory over Japanese club Gamba Osaka in the FIFA Club World Cup, and, after scoring the winning goal as United beat LDU Quito 1–0 in the final in Yokohama, was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player in the tournament. On 14 January after scoring 54 seconds into the 1–0 win over Wigan, Rooney limped off with a hamstring injury in the eighth minute. On 25 April 2009, Rooney scored his final league goals of the season against Tottenham; United scored five goals in the second half to come from 2–0 down to win 5–2; Rooney scored two goals, set up two and provided the assist that led to the penalty for United&#x27;s first goal. On 27 May, Rooney played against Barcelona in the 2009 Champions League Final in Rome, with United losing 2–0. Rooney ended the season with 20 goals in all competitions. Once again, he managed 12 goals in the league.

Rooney scored in the 90th minute of the season-opening 2009 Community Shield, although United lost the game to Chelsea on penalties. He then scored the only goal of the first league game of the 2009–10 season against Birmingham City, taking his overall United tally to 99. On 22 August, he became the 20th Manchester United player to score 100 goals for the club, when he found the net twice in a 5–0 away win at Wigan. On 29 August, United played Arsenal at Old Trafford. Rooney scored a goal from the penalty spot to level the game after Andrey Arshavin had put the Gunners ahead. The game finished 2–1 to Manchester United after Abou Diaby scored an own goal. On 28 November 2009, Rooney scored his first hat-trick for three years in a 4–1 away victory against Portsmouth, with two of the goals being penalties. On 27 December 2009, he was awarded Man of the Match against Hull City. He was involved in all the goals scored in the game, hitting the opener and then giving away the ball for Hull&#x27;s equalising penalty. He then forced Andy Dawson into conceding an own goal and then set up Dimitar Berbatov for United&#x27;s third goal which gave them a 3–1 victory. On 30 December 2009, Rooney scored another goal as United beat Wigan 5–0 in their final game of the decade.

On 23 January 2010, Rooney scored all four goals in Manchester United&#x27;s 4–0 win over Hull; three of the goals came in the last ten minutes of the match. This was the first time in his career that he registered four goals in a single match. On 27 January 2010, he continued his scoring run by heading the winner in the second minute of stoppage time against derby rivals Manchester City. This gave United a 4–3 aggregate win, taking them into the final; it was his first League Cup goal since netting two in the 2006 final. On 31 January 2010, Rooney scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3–1 win over Arsenal for the first time in the league at Emirates Stadium, notably his first Premier League goal also came against Arsenal. On 16 February 2010, Rooney hit his first European goals of the season, scoring two headers in the 3–2 away win against Milan in Manchester United&#x27;s first ever win against them at the San Siro. On 28 February 2010, he scored another header against Aston Villa (his fifth consecutive headed goal) which resulted in Manchester United winning the League Cup final 2–1. In the second leg of United&#x27;s European tie against Milan, Rooney scored a brace in a resounding 4–0 home victory, taking his tally of goals that season to 30. He then added two more to his tally five days later at Old Trafford, in a 3–0 league win over Fulham.

On 30 March, during United&#x27;s Champions League quarter-final first leg defeat against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, Rooney crumpled when he twisted his ankle in the last minute, hobbling off while Bayern were producing the buildup that led to their second goal. There were fears that he had received serious ligament damage or even a broken ankle, but it was announced that the injury was only slight ligament damage, and that he would be out for two to three weeks, missing United&#x27;s crunch match with Chelsea and the return leg against Bayern the following week. The team list for second leg yielded a massive surprise when Rooney was given a starting place in the United line-up. Despite a 3–0 lead by the 41st minute, Bayern snatched a goal back and United were later forced down to 10 men after Rafael was sent-off. Bayern won the match after netting a second away-goal and Rooney was substituted after re-damaging his ankle. On 25 April, Rooney was named the 2010 PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year.

==== 2010–2011: Ambition dispute ====
On 28 August 2010, Rooney scored his first goal of the season as he netted a penalty in a 3–0 home win over West Ham United. In October, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson stated at a press conference that Rooney wanted to quit the club. This came after a period of dispute as to the extent of Rooney&#x27;s ankle injury, where Rooney had refuted Ferguson&#x27;s claim that the injury was the reason Rooney had been dropped to the bench. Rooney and his representatives released a statement regarding his decision to leave the club, insisting it was not down to money but ambition. Following this statement, Rooney made a dramatic U-turn and agreed a new five-year contract at Manchester United until June 2015.
Rooney made his return to the first team as a substitute against Wigan on 20 November. Four days later, he returned to the starting line-up and scored a penalty in a 1–0 away win over Rangers in the Champions League. He missed a penalty in a 1–0 home win over Arsenal on 13 December. His first goal of the season from open play came on 1 January 2011 in a 2–1 away win over West Bromwich Albion. On 1 February, Rooney scored twice and provided an assist for Nemanja Vidić in a 3–1 home win over Aston Villa. On 12 February, Rooney scored an overhead bicycle kick in the 78th minute of the Manchester derby, which proved to be the winning goal in a 2–1 win over Manchester City. After the match, Rooney said it was the best goal of his career, before Sir Alex Ferguson described the strike as the best goal he had ever witnessed at Old Trafford. The acrobatic strike from 10 yards out would win Rooney his third BBC Goal of the Season award, and it was shortlisted for the FIFA Puskás Award for Goal of the Year (ultimately won by Neymar). Two weeks later, he scored the third goal in a 4–0 away win over Wigan, before opening the scoring in a 2–1 away loss to Chelsea on 1 March. Rooney scored the second goal in a 2–0 home win over Arsenal in an FA Cup tie on 12 March.

On 2 April, United came from two goals down as Rooney scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 4–2 away win over West Ham. This was his fifth hat-trick for Manchester United, whilst the second goal was his 100th in the Premier League for the club. He became the third Manchester United player to score 100 Premier League goals, joining Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes. During Rooney&#x27;s celebrations following his third goal, he swore into a pitchside camera and was subsequently charged by the FA for using offensive language. Rooney accepted the charge, but not the automatic two-match ban which was handed to him. He appealed against the length of the suspension, calling it &quot;excessive&quot;, but failed to overturn the ban, which ruled him out of the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City on 16 April. The following game on 6 April saw Rooney score in a 1–0 away win against Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. He followed this goal up with another strike in the semi-final first leg against German side Schalke 04 on 26 April, scoring the second of a 2–0 away win. This was the first time Rooney had returned to the Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen since his sending off during the 2006 FIFA World Cup against Portugal.

On 14 May 2011, Rooney scored a penalty for United to equalise in a 1–1 draw against Blackburn at Ewood Park in the penultimate game of the Premier League season – enough to secure a record 19th top division title for United, and giving Rooney his fourth Premier League title winner&#x27;s medal. On 28 May, in the Champions League final against Barcelona at Wembley, Rooney scored a 34th minute equaliser, but his team lost 3–1.

==== 2011–2013: Divisional success ====
Rooney started the season with a goal in the first league game at The Hawthorns against West Bromwich Albion. Rooney played a one-two with Ashley Young before a sharp turn and finish from outside the box which found the bottom corner of the goal. He also scored in the second game of the season, at home to Tottenham Hotspur, when he headed in a Ryan Giggs cross. In late August, Rooney scored his 150th goal for United, the first of a hat-trick, helping to beat Arsenal 8–2. Rooney won man of the match, scoring two free kicks, a penalty, and also contributing an assist for Nani. On 10 September, Rooney scored another hat-trick in a 5–0 away win over Bolton Wanderers on 10 September, becoming only the fourth player in Premier League history to score a hat-trick in consecutive games. These goals brought him level with Bobby Charlton on seven United hat-tricks, joint fourth on the all-time list behind Denis Law, Jack Rowley and Dennis Viollet. After the fallout from his red card against Montenegro on international duty, Rooney was left out of the starting line-up against Liverpool on 15 October 2011. He returned to action on 18 October 2011, where he scored two goals in the Champions League group stage match against Oțelul Galați and surpassed his former teammate Paul Scholes as the highest-scoring Englishman in Champions League history.
On 10 December, Rooney ended an eight-game goal drought with a brace against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a 4–1 win at Old Trafford. On 18 December, Rooney continued his goalscoring form, heading home the opening goal against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road; it was Manchester United&#x27;s quickest of the season so far, as Rooney turned home Antonio Valencia&#x27;s cross after just 52 seconds. On 21 December, Rooney scored his 130th Premier League goal in his 300th Premier League appearance against Fulham at Craven Cottage with a long-range effort that crashed in off the inside of the post in a 5–0 win.

On 8 January, Rooney scored two goals in the 3–2 win over Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium in the FA Cup third round. With these goals, Rooney passed Mark Hughes in United&#x27;s all-time top goalscorers table, moving up to seventh place overall with 164 goals. On 14 January, Rooney made a big contribution to his team in a 3–0 home win against Bolton. Although he missed a penalty, he did create two goals by assisting Paul Scholes for the first goal and Danny Welbeck for the second. On 5 February, Rooney scored twice from the penalty spot as United came back from a 3–0 deficit to draw 3–3 in a Premier League clash against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. On 11 February 2012, Rooney marked his 500th senior career game by scoring two goals as Manchester United beat rivals Liverpool 2–1 at Old Trafford. This was also his 350th game for United in all competitions. On 4 March, Rooney scored the first goal in a 3–1 away win against Tottenham at White Hart Lane and passed Joe Spence in Manchester United&#x27;s all-time top goalscorers table, moving up to sixth place overall with 169 goals. He scored another brace in his next game, against Atletico Bilbao in the UEFA Europa League. On 11 March, Rooney scored the two goals that brought United the victory against West Brom in a 2–0 home win. On 15 March, Rooney scored in the second leg of the Europa League tie against Athletic Bilbao in Bilbao despite United losing 2–1 on the night and 5–3 on aggregate. In the final day of the season, Rooney put United ahead against Sunderland. Their rivals for the Premier League title, Manchester City, were losing 2–1 in their game going into injury time, so Rooney&#x27;s winner looked like it would seal the title. However, Manchester City scored twice in injury time, the clincher a 94th-minute winner from Sergio Agüero, to take the trophy.

Despite starting the opening game of the 2012–13 season against Everton, Rooney was dropped to the bench for the second game against Fulham in favour of new signing Robin van Persie. After coming on for Shinji Kagawa in the 68th minute, Rooney suffered a severe gash to his right leg caused by Fulham&#x27;s Hugo Rodallega that kept him out for four weeks. He made his comeback on 29 September in a 3–2 loss against Tottenham. Rooney scored his first goals of the season in a 4–2 league win at home to Stoke City on 20 October, where he reached his 200th club goal. On 7 November, he scored his first Champions League goal of the season, scoring a penalty in a 3–1 win against Braga. He scored twice and provided an assist in a 4–3 win against Reading on 1 December. He scored a brace in the Manchester derby at the City of Manchester Stadium on 9 December 2012 which United won 3–2. On 16 January, he scored a goal against West Ham in the FA Cup. A fortnight later, he scored twice in a 2–1 win against Southampton. He continued to score goals in FA Cup consecutive matches against Fulham and Chelsea. On 12 May, Sir Alex Ferguson announced, after United&#x27;s 2–1 win against Swansea City, that Rooney had handed in his transfer request, a match in which Rooney also requested not to play.

==== 2013–2015: Post-Fergie years ====
On 5 July 2013, new United manager David Moyes announced that Rooney was not for sale, after speculation that Chelsea, Arsenal, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain were among the clubs looking to sign him. On 17 July 2013, Chelsea confirmed that they had made a bid for Rooney the previous day, thought to be in the region of £20 million, however it had been rejected by Manchester United. He suffered a head gash in training on 31 August after a collision with Phil Jones which kept him out of the match against Liverpool. He scored his first goal of the season with a free-kick in a 2–0 win against Crystal Palace. On 17 September, Rooney scored twice in a 4–2 win against Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League, marking his 200th goal for United in the process. On 22 September, Rooney scored a late consolation goal from a free-kick in the 4–1 loss in the Manchester derby against Manchester City. He scored a brace against Tottenham at White Hart Lane in a 2–2 draw on 1 December. He scored his 150th league goal for the club with a volley against Hull City on 26 December as United came back from 2–0 deficit to win the match 3–2; he also provided assists for the other two goals. On 21 February 2014, Rooney signed a contract extension with Manchester United, which would have kept him at Old Trafford until 2019. Rooney provided one assist to Robin van Persie as Manchester United defeated Olympiacos in the second leg of Champions League round of 16 tie. On 22 March 2014, Rooney scored two goals for United at West Ham, moving him to third place on the club&#x27;s all-time scoring list with 212 career goals. Rooney ended the season as both the top scorer and assist for Manchester United in the league with 17 goals and 10 assists. He also had the most assists in the 2013–14 Champions League with eight, beating second-placed Ángel Di María who had six.
After the departure of Nemanja Vidić from Manchester United in July 2014, Rooney was named club captain by new manager Louis van Gaal ahead of the 2014–15 season. On the opening day of the Premier League season on 16 August, Rooney scored a bicycle kick to equalise against Swansea, although United eventually lost 1–2. On 27 September 2014, Rooney became the third highest Premier League goalscorer, moving ahead of Thierry Henry with 176 goals after he netted a goal in a 2–1 victory against West Ham. In the same match, he was sent off for a foul on Stewart Downing and received a three-game suspension. On 22 November 2014, Rooney scored for United in a 2–1 win against rivals Arsenal, their first away win of the season. He continued to score in the following match, in a 3–0 win over Hull City. On 14 December, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 win over rivals Liverpool. On 26 December, Rooney scored two goals against Newcastle United, a match which his side won 3–1 – United&#x27;s 50th successive Boxing Day match. For his performances, Rooney was voted as United&#x27;s Player of the Month for December. During the season, Rooney was often deployed as a midfielder by Van Gaal.

On 16 February 2015, in an FA Cup match against Preston North End, Rooney was the subject of criticism for having dived to get a penalty; United would go on to win the match 3–1. Replay seemed to have shown that Rooney had not come in contact with the goalkeeper. England manager Roy Hodgson, however, defended Rooney, saying that he was forced to take evasive action. Rooney later apologised for his behaviour, saying, &quot;that was my chance to get a penalty. I had to use that.&quot; The penalty was also Rooney&#x27;s first goal in 2015, ending a goalless run. On 28 February 2015, he scored a brace in a 2–0 victory over Sunderland, thus becoming the first player to score more than 10 goals in 11 successive seasons. On 15 March, Rooney scored the third goal in a 3–0 win over Tottenham. Rooney was Manchester United&#x27;s top goalscorer for the 2014–15 campaign, but his tally of 14 was the lowest by a leading scorer since 1982. United&#x27;s goal total of 62 was also its second-worst in the Premier League era.

==== 2015–2017: Final years and exit ====
On 26 August 2015, Rooney ended an 878-minute scoreless streak by scoring a hat-trick in a 4–0 win (7–1 aggregate) over Belgian side Club Brugge in the second leg of their Champions League play-off. It was his first treble in European competition since his United debut against Fenerbahçe in 2004. He netted in a 3–0 win away to Everton on 17 October, putting him on 187 Premier League goals, joint second with Andy Cole and behind only Alan Shearer. After an injury-related absence, Rooney returned to the starting line-up on 19 December, making his 500th Manchester United appearance in a 2–1 home loss to Norwich City.

On 2 January 2016, Rooney scored in a 2–1 win over Swansea to move ahead of Cole as the Premier League&#x27;s second top scorer of all time, and with 238 he surpassed Denis Law in United&#x27;s top scorers of all time, behind only Bobby Charlton&#x27;s 249. Fifteen days later, he scored the only goal in a win against Liverpool at Anfield, his 176th league goal for United, taking Thierry Henry&#x27;s record for most goals for one club in the Premier League. After being ruled out since 13 February due to a knee injury, Rooney returned to the starting line-up in a 1–0 home win over Aston Villa on 16 April. On 21 May, Rooney captained Manchester United in the 2016 FA Cup Final against Crystal Palace. He played the full 120 minutes in central midfield, winning the competition for the first time in his career after a 2–1 extra time victory at Wembley Stadium.
On 7 August 2016, Rooney set up Jesse Lingard&#x27;s opening goal in Manchester United&#x27;s 2–1 victory over Leicester City in the 2016 FA Community Shield, lifting his second title as the club&#x27;s captain. On 6 November 2016, Rooney became only the third player ever to achieve 100 Premier League assists, setting up both of Zlatan Ibrahimović&#x27;s goals in a 3–1 away win against Swansea City. On 24 November, Rooney overtook Ruud van Nistelrooy to become Manchester United&#x27;s all-time leading scorer in European competitions with 39 goals, opening the scoring in a 4–0 home win over Feyenoord in the Europa League.

On 7 January 2017, Rooney scored against Reading in the third round of the FA Cup to equal Bobby Charlton as Manchester United&#x27;s top goalscorer of all time. Rooney&#x27;s goal was his 249th in 543 games for Manchester United, reaching the landmark in 215 matches and four seasons quicker than Charlton. On 21 January 2017, Rooney finally surpassed Charlton to become the outright leading scorer for Manchester United after scoring his 250th goal for the club and the equaliser from a free kick against Stoke City at the Bet365 Stadium in the game&#x27;s final minutes to secure a 1–1 draw. On 29 January, prior to playing his part in the 4–0 triumph in the FA Cup fourth round against Wigan Athletic, Rooney was presented with a commemorative Golden Boot to acknowledge him becoming the club&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer. It was presented by Charlton whose record Rooney broke. On 14 May 2017, in a 2–1 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on the last day of the Premier League season, Rooney had the distinction of scoring the final goal at Spurs&#x27; White Hart Lane stadium. In his last game for Manchester United, Rooney came on as a substitute as United beat Ajax 2–0 to win the UEFA Europa League. He finished his Manchester United career as the all-time top scorer for the club with 253 goals, winning five Premier League titles and each of the Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup.

=== Later career ===

==== 2017–2018: Brief return to Everton ====
After much speculation over the previous few months, it was confirmed on 9 July 2017 that Rooney would return to his boyhood club, Everton, on a two-year contract, after Manchester United allowed him to leave on a free transfer. Rooney was assigned the number 10 shirt for the 2017–18 campaign. He made his first official appearance on his return to the club in a 1–0 win over MFK Ružomberok in the UEFA Europa League third qualifying round first leg on 27 July. He scored on his second Everton league debut on 12 August, when his club beat Stoke City 1–0 at Goodison Park. Nine days later, Rooney scored his 200th Premier League goal in a 1–1 away draw against Manchester City, becoming the second player to reach this landmark, Alan Shearer being the first. On 29 November, Rooney scored his first hat-trick for Everton in 4–0 win over West Ham; his third goal was a strike from inside his own side&#x27;s half of the field – over 60 yards from goal – scoring as goalkeeper Joe Hart left the penalty area to clear the ball.

In a 3–1 win against Swansea City on 18 December, Rooney scored a penalty and provided the assist for Gylfi Sigurðsson&#x27;s goal, which put him ahead of Frank Lampard as the player with the third-highest amounts of assists in the Premier League, with 103. He appeared on Sky Sports&#x27; &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; as a pundit in February 2018, garnering praise from &quot;The Guardian&quot; writer Sachin Nakrani for being &quot;articulate, intelligent, insightful and honest&quot;. On the show he named Anfield, home of Manchester United&#x27;s rivals Liverpool, as his hardest test, with Rooney stating &quot;I never enjoyed playing there&quot;.

==== 2018–2020: Relocation to MLS ====

On 28 June 2018, Rooney signed a three-and-a-half-year deal with D.C. United of Major League Soccer, and was given the number 9 jersey. He officially completed his move to the Washington-based team when the US mid-season transfer window opened on 10 July.

Rooney made his debut for D.C. United on 14 July, coming on for Darren Mattocks in the 59th minute of a 3–1 win against the Vancouver Whitecaps; provided the assist for Paul Arriola&#x27;s second goal, which gave D.C. a 3–0 lead. Rooney&#x27;s debut came on the unveiling of Audi Field, D.C. United&#x27;s new home stadium. Rooney was named captain after three games by manager Ben Olsen, with the consent of former captain Steve Birnbaum. His first goal for the club came on 28 July in his first game with the armband, slotting past his former Manchester United teammate, goalkeeper Tim Howard, securing a 2–1 win over the Colorado Rapids at Audi Field; he left the game with a broken nose after a clash of heads with Axel Sjöberg.

After putting in positive performances for D.C. United, including a last-ditch tackle and pass for the game-winning goal against Orlando on 12 August, and helping them to a play-off spot, he was named &#x27;MLS Player of the Month&#x27; for the month of October 2018. His team made the 2018 MLS Cup Playoffs but were knocked out at home to the Columbus Crew SC in the first round, in which his attempt in the penalty shootout was saved by Zack Steffen. At the end of the 2018 MLS campaign, he was named as D.C. United&#x27;s MVP and golden boot winner, having scored 12 goals in 21 matches.

On 16 March 2019, Rooney notched his first hat-trick for D.C. United in a 5–0 home win over Real Salt Lake, also contributing an assist, and later in the season he scored his 300th career goal at club level in a 2–1 away defeat to Houston Dynamo. On 27 June, Rooney scored from inside his own half for the third time in his career with a match-winning strike from 10 yards behind the halfway line to lob Orlando City goalkeeper Brian Rowe. He played his final match for the club on 19 October, in a 5–1 away defeat to Toronto FC, in the first round of the playoffs. He ended his time in the MLS with 23 goals and 15 assists in 48 regular-season appearances.
He had a total of 25 goals in 52 appearances (all competitions) for D.C. United.

====2020–2021: Player-manager role at Derby County and retirement====
On 6 August 2019, with two years left on his contract with D.C. United, Rooney agreed a deal to return to England as a player-coach with EFL Championship side Derby County in January 2020. Rooney was instantly named captain and his debut came on 2 January as he started and assisted the first goal in a 2–1 win against Barnsley. Rooney scored six goals in twenty four appearances, including the deciding goals in a 2–1 victory against Reading and a 1–0 win at Preston North End, as Derby finished the season in 10th.

Rooney&#x27;s first goal of the 2020–21 season came in the fourth match as his 87th-minute free kick proved the difference in 1–0 win away to Norwich City. It was Derby&#x27;s first win of the season and took the club out of the bottom three after opening the campaign with three successive defeats. Results did not improve however, with manager Phillip Cocu leaving by mutual consent after a 1–0 home defeat to Queens Park Rangers. Rooney in particular came under criticism for his performances in the opening stages of the season. It was announced on 26 November that Rooney, who had replaced Cocu as part of a four-man interim management team, would take sole control of the side for the upcoming match against Wycombe Wanderers and had removed himself from the playing squad, admitting that it was &quot;possible&quot; he had played his final game. On 15 January 2021, he retired from playing after being appointed permanent manager of Derby.

== International career ==
=== Early international career and Euro 2004 ===

Rooney was eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland, through his Irish paternal grandparents. In 2015, he confirmed that he had rejected an approach from Ireland at the age of 16, describing himself as &quot;English through and through&quot;.

Rooney became the youngest player to play for England when he earned his first cap in a friendly defeat against Australia at the Boleyn Ground on 12 February 2003 at 17 years and 111 days, coming on at half-time as manager Sven-Göran Eriksson fielded a different team in each half. On 6 September of that year, aged 17 years and 317 days, he became the youngest player to score for England, equalising in a 2–1 away victory over Macedonia in a UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying match.

His first tournament action was at UEFA Euro 2004, in which he became the youngest scorer in competition history on 17 June 2004, when he scored twice in England&#x27;s second group match against Switzerland, which ended in a 3–0 victory; however, this record was topped by Swiss midfielder Johan Vonlanthen four days later. Rooney added two more goals in the competition in England&#x27;s final group match on 21 June, a 4–2 win over Croatia, but subsequently suffered an injury in the quarter-final match against hosts Portugal on 24 June, and England were eliminated on penalties. After scoring four goals in four matches, Rooney was named in UEFA&#x27;s Team of the Tournament.

=== 2006 and 2010 World Cups ===
Following a foot injury in an April 2006 Premier League match, Rooney faced a race to fitness for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. England attempted to hasten his recovery with the use of an oxygen tent, which allowed Rooney to enter a group match against Trinidad and Tobago and start the next match against Sweden. However, he never got back into game shape and went scoreless as England bowed out in the quarter-finals, again on penalty kicks.
Rooney was red-carded in the 62nd minute of the quarter-final for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho as both attempted to gain possession of the ball. Rooney seemed to be pulled back by Carvalho, and then trod on his opponent&#x27;s groin as the Chelsea defender was on the floor trying to win the ball, an incident that occurred right in front of the Argentine referee Horacio Elizondo.

Portugal winger (and Rooney&#x27;s Manchester United teammate) Cristiano Ronaldo protested his actions, and was in turn pushed by Rooney. Elizondo sent Rooney off, after which Ronaldo was seen winking at the Portugal bench. Rooney denied intentionally targeting Carvalho in a statement on 3 July, adding,

Elizondo confirmed the next day that Rooney was dismissed solely for the infraction on Carvalho. Rooney was fined CHF5,000 for the incident.

Rooney top scored for England in their 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign with nine goals; one behind the UEFA section&#x27;s overall top goalscorer, Theofanis Gekas of Greece. On 14 November 2009, Rooney captained England for the first time in a pre-tournament friendly with Brazil.

Rooney was given the England number 10 shirt by manager Fabio Capello ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. During the tournament, England drew 0–0 in their second group match against Algeria on 18 June, and the England players were booed off the pitch by their supporters; Rooney was at the centre of controversy when he criticised the England fans for booing the team after the match, and subsequently apologised for his actions. Rooney went scoreless throughout the tournament, and England were eliminated in the second round, following a 4–1 defeat to Germany on 27 June.

=== Euro 2012 ===
The Euro 2012 qualification campaign went well for England, as they qualified at the top of their group, winning five and drawing three games. Rooney scored three goals, one against Switzerland and two against Bulgaria. In the last qualifier against Montenegro (2–2), Rooney was sent off for a tackle on Miodrag Džudović in the 74th minute. It was anticipated that Rooney would miss at least one match in the opening round of the first phase at UEFA Euro 2012. After the game, Rooney sent a personal letter to UEFA in which he apologised and expressed regret for the tackle on Džudović which earned him the red card.

Despite the letter, UEFA punished Rooney with a three-game ban, meaning that he could not play in any of the group stage matches. After UEFA&#x27;s announcement, Džudović stated that he believed the sentence for Rooney was too severe and that he would defend him if needed. He later asked the UEFA to pardon Rooney. The FA then decided they would appeal to UEFA against the ban. On 8 December 2011, after the FA had appealed the ban, UEFA reduced the sentence to two matches. This meant that Rooney missed the matches against France and Sweden. He was able to play in the final match of the group stage against Ukraine on 19 June 2012, scoring the only goal of the game, allowing England to progress to the quarter-finals. England were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals against Italy, who, after a scoreless 120 minutes, won 4–2 on penalties, although Rooney was able to net his spot-kick. After another international tournament in which the English media criticised Rooney&#x27;s performances, Fabio Capello claimed Rooney &quot;only plays well in Manchester.&quot;

=== 2014 World Cup ===

On 12 October 2012, Rooney became England&#x27;s fifth-highest goalscorer of all time after scoring his 30th and 31st international goals in a 2014 World Cup qualifier against San Marino. Rooney captained England for the first time in a competitive match in the same game. On 6 February 2013, Rooney scored in a 2–1 win against five-time world champions Brazil at Wembley in a friendly. In March, he scored goals against San Marino and Montenegro in World Cup qualifying, before scoring against Brazil again in a 2–2 draw on 2 June, in the official re-opening of the refurbished Maracanã Stadium. On 11 October 2013, Rooney became England&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer in competitive internationals when he scored his 27th competitive goal in a 4–1 World Cup qualifier against Montenegro. Rooney ended the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign as England&#x27;s top scorer with seven goals.

At the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Rooney started in England&#x27;s first group match against Italy, setting up Daniel Sturridge&#x27;s temporary equaliser, in a 2–1 loss. In England&#x27;s second 2014 World Cup group match against Uruguay at the Arena Corinthians, Rooney scored his first ever goal at a World Cup finals with a 75th-minute equaliser in a 2–1 loss. England drew their final group match 0–0 against Costa Rica, and were eliminated from the World Cup, finishing last in their group; despite playing a part in both of England&#x27;s goals, Rooney was criticised by English pundits for his performance in the tournament.

=== Euro 2016 ===
Following Steven Gerrard&#x27;s international retirement after the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Roy Hodgson named Rooney as England&#x27;s new captain. On 3 September 2014, in the first match of his captaincy, Rooney scored a penalty against Norway to give England a 1–0 friendly win. Later on, he showed his leadership qualities by calling player-only meetings in September 2014 to reflect on the players&#x27; performance and discuss how they could do better as a team. Rooney said,

On 15 November 2014, Rooney won his 100th England cap against Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifying match, scoring a penalty to equalise in a 3–1 win. In another qualifier away to the same opponents on 14 June 2015, Rooney scored the winner with four minutes remaining for a 3–2 victory, his 48th international goal putting him joint second in England&#x27;s list alongside Gary Lineker, and one behind Bobby Charlton. In his 106th England appearance, he equalled Charlton&#x27;s record of 49 goals (also in 106 matches) on 5 September 2015 by scoring a penalty against San Marino. On 8 September 2015, Rooney broke Charlton&#x27;s England goalscoring record, netting his 50th international goal from a penalty in a Euro 2016 qualifying match against Switzerland, at Wembley, in his 107th appearance for England, also equalling Ashley Cole as his country&#x27;s fifth-highest capped player; this was also his 300th professional career goal.

In England&#x27;s opening match of UEFA Euro 2016 against Russia at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille on 11 June, Rooney was selected to start in central midfield and was named man of the match by the BBC after a 1–1 draw. On 27 June, he scored the opening goal against Iceland in the round of 16 from a penalty in the 4th minute. However England would lose the match 2-1 which eliminated them from the tournament.

===2018 World Cup qualification and retirement===
On 4 September 2016, Rooney earned his 116th appearance for England in 1–0 away win over Slovakia in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, making him the nation&#x27;s most-capped outfield player of all time, and England&#x27;s second highest appearance maker behind Peter Shilton. A few days earlier, he had confirmed that he would retire from international football after the finals in Russia. In March 2017, Rooney had been left out of the England squad by England boss Gareth Southgate. Following Rooney&#x27;s return to Everton in July, which saw him put on a string of impressive performances, Southgate wanted to recall Rooney back to the England squad for the upcoming 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. However, Rooney announced his early retirement from international football with immediate effect on 23 August 2017, snubbing Southgate&#x27;s recall.

On 4 November 2018, it was confirmed that Rooney would come out of international retirement to play one final match for the England national football team against the United States at Wembley Stadium on 15 November. This was in order to promote The Wayne Rooney Foundation, a newly formed charity; consequently, the match was called the &quot;Wayne Rooney Foundation International&quot;. He came on in the 58th minute of England&#x27;s eventual 3–0 home win, ending his international career with 120 appearances.

==Managerial career==
In August 2020, Rooney was announced as the manager for the England team at Soccer Aid 2020, assisted by Sam Allardyce and goalkeeper coach David Seaman.

===Derby County===
After a poor start to the 2020–21 season saw Derby County bottom of the Championship table – their lowest position for 12 years – Derby boss Phillip Cocu was sacked, and Rooney was appointed as part of a four-man interim coaching staff alongside Liam Rosenior, Shay Given and Justin Walker on 14 November 2020. His debut a week later saw Derby lose 1–0 at Bristol City to leave them at the foot of the table and three points from safety, though Rooney said he could guarantee that the side would &quot;get better (and) get out of the situation we&#x27;re in and... start winning games.&quot; Following a &quot;painful and chastening&quot; 3–0 defeat to Middlesbrough it was announced that Rooney would take sole control of the side for the next match and had removed himself from the playing squad, with Rooney making clear his desire to take the role full time. Rooney started sole charge with The Rams in 24th, six points adrift of safety and on a run of four consecutive defeats; after improving Derby&#x27;s form enough to get them out of the relegation zone he was appointed as permanent manager on 15 January.

By mid-February 2021, having accrued 31 points from a possible 54 in his 18 games in sole charge, taking Derby up to 18th in the league and eight points clear of the relegation zone, Rooney was feted by the press for &quot;convincing the doubters&quot; and found himself as 25/1 outsider for the Celtic job following the resignation of Neil Lennon. Following this, however, form faltered badly with just one win from fourteen leaving Derby firmly in trouble, with Rooney&#x27;s side being criticised for their poor game management and sloppy defending and suggestion that Rooney came across &quot;as a manager who&#x27;s accepted defeat, who&#x27;s surrender [&quot;sic&quot;] himself to whatever results might come his way&quot; and should be replaced. Others defended Rooney, saying that though he had made mistakes, particularly in making &quot;too many changes to personnel and shape/tactics&quot; he had not been helped by injuries and too many players who had &quot;been inconsistent (and) unable to maintain form both during a game and from game to game.&quot; However, at the last match of the season, Derby County drew 3–3 at home with Sheffield Wednesday to barely avoid relegation.

Incurring 21 points of deductions, Derby were relegated to League One at the end of the 2021–22 season, having spent almost the entire season in administration. With Derby still in administration going into the League One season, Rooney resigned as manager on 24 June 2022.

===D.C. United===
On 12 July 2022, Rooney was announced as head coach for his former club, MLS side D.C. United. He replaced outgoing manager Hernán Losada, on a contract to the end of the 2023 season.

Rooney won 2–1 at home to Orlando City on his debut on 31 July 2022, and picked up 9 points from the 14 last games of the season as his team ranked last in the Eastern Conference.

At the end of the 2023 regular season, on 8 October, Rooney and the club agreed to mutually part ways, after United failed to qualify for the playoffs for a second straight season.

===Birmingham City===
On 11 October 2023, Rooney made his return to English football as he was appointed manager of EFL Championship club Birmingham City on a three-and-a-half-year contract. He was appointed by American new owners Shelby Companies Limited, and replaced the sacked John Eustace at the sixth-placed club. Rooney brought his former teammates Ashley Cole and John O&#x27;Shea into his coaching staff.

On his debut 10 days later, Rooney&#x27;s team lost 1–0 at Middlesbrough, managed by his former United and England teammate Michael Carrick. He earned one point from his first five games, seeing his team fall to 18th in the table. Rooney earned his first victory as Birmingham manager with a 2–1 defeat of bottom side Sheffield Wednesday on 25 November 2023.

On 2 January 2024, Rooney was sacked by the club after winning just twice in 15 matches, leaving Birmingham in 20th position. Both before and after his tenure at St Andrew&#x27;s, Rooney was likened to Gianfranco Zola, who was appointed by new owners in 2016 in place of the less recognisable Gary Rowett and oversaw a decline in results. Birmingham ended the season relegated to the third tier for the first time since 1995, and Rooney&#x27;s spell in charge was mentioned by fans and media as a leading reason for the relegation.

===Plymouth Argyle===
On 25 May 2024, Rooney was appointed manager of EFL Championship club Plymouth Argyle on a three-year contract. In his first game, on 11 August, his team lost 4–0 away to Sheffield Wednesday.

On 31 December 2024, with the team in last place and four points from safety, Rooney left Plymouth in a mutual agreement with the club. According to Alan Richardson of BBC Radio Devon, Rooney&#x27;s Plymouth attempted the possession-based football associated with Pep Guardiola but lacked an alternative when teams set up to counter that tactic. Form was particularly poor away from home, where the Pilgrims only earned two points from 13 games, scoring three goals and conceding 35. The team also suffered from extensive injuries, including to key attacking player Morgan Whittaker. Rooney was described as being popular with Plymouth players, fans and the local media.

== Style of play ==
Regarded as one of the best players of his generation, Rooney was a creative, energetic forward who combined technical skill with strength and physicality, while also excelling in the air despite being tall. He was a versatile attacker, capable of playing anywhere along the front line; although his preferred role was as a striker. Rooney was also used as a supporting forward, or even as a winger. As his pace and movement declined as he entered his thirties, he was deployed in deeper, more creative roles, as an attacking midfielder, as a deep-lying playmaker, or even as a central or box-to-box midfielder, in particular under former manager Louis van Gaal, due to his vision, range of passing, runs forward from midfield, and team-work. He was also occasionally deployed as a false attacking midfielder, and as a false 9 throughout his career.

A prolific goalscorer in his prime at Manchester United, Rooney was a powerful striker of the ball and an accurate finisher, capable of scoring both inside and outside the penalty area, as well as from volleys. His ball striking ability saw him score from inside his own half for Manchester United, Everton, and D.C. United. He was praised for his work-rate and stamina by players, managers and the media, and was highly regarded for his dedication and willingness to press opponents when possession had been lost in order to win back the ball and start attacking plays. While not known to be particularly prolific from free kicks, he also often took set pieces and penalties throughout his career, although his record from the spot was somewhat inconsistent.

Due to his precocious displays as a teenager, Wayne Rooney was given the nicknames &quot;Wazza&quot; (a reference to former England international Paul &quot;Gazza&quot; Gascoigne, who was also a gifted player troubled by off-field issues), &quot;The Wonder Boy&quot;, &quot;the new Pelé&quot;, and &quot;the white Pelé&quot;. Rooney was a fast, agile player in his youth; however, several injuries throughout his career, in addition to weight issues, affected his speed and mobility as his career progressed, which led to some in the game accusing him of not quite living up to his full potential. He was warned about his fitness on numerous occasions by his manager Alex Ferguson, who said of Rooney, &quot;He is very stocky, he is going to have to train well all the time.&quot; Former Manchester United fitness coach Mick Clegg, stated, &quot;Wayne didn&#x27;t see the importance of the gym really. He&#x27;d say &#x27;I&#x27;m here to play football.&quot; Rooney was criticised for his behaviour and aggression on the pitch at times, which led him to pick up unnecessary bookings.

Formerly the all-time leading goalscorer for the England national team, Rooney is viewed as one of England&#x27;s greatest players. In 2017, Gareth Southgate said: &quot;You&#x27;ve got very good players and then there are top players. In my time in the England setup, Paul Gascoigne, Paul Scholes and Rooney just had that little bit more than all the others. And we are talking high‑level people there, players like Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and David Beckham.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In addition to Everton, Rooney also supports Celtic. He is also a supporter of the Leeds Rhinos rugby league club. Rooney, originally a boxer, still practices the sport recreationally for stress relief. A friend of boxer Ricky Hatton, in 2007 he carried one of Hatton&#x27;s belts into the ring in his world light-welterweight title fight against José Luis Castillo in Las Vegas. The decision of Hatton (a Manchester City fan) to have a Manchester United striker carry the belt prompted threats of a boycott among the many Manchester City supporters who made up Hatton&#x27;s fanbase. Hatton responded, &quot;Nobody hates United more than me. Just because I don&#x27;t support his team doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t admire what he has done.&quot; Rooney has a number of tattoos, including one of a Celtic cross on his arm.

=== Family ===

Rooney met his wife, Coleen (née McLoughlin), while both were at secondary school. They married on 12 June 2008 after six years of dating. He has a tattoo of the words &quot;Just Enough Education to Perform&quot;, the title of an album by his favourite band, the Stereophonics; Coleen arranged for the group to play at their wedding reception. The wedding ran into some controversy with the Catholic Church. The couple held a religious ceremony at the Abbey of Cervara, a converted monastery near Genoa, despite being warned by the local bishop&#x27;s office against the plan. The bishop&#x27;s office told the Rooneys that La Cervara is deconsecrated and not suitable for a wedding. It suggested a different church, five miles away. Nevertheless, the couple ignored the advice and Father Edward Quinn, their local Catholic priest from Croxteth, presided over the ceremony. Coleen&#x27;s favourite pop band, Westlife, also sang at the wedding reception.

The couple have four sons: Kai Wayne (born 2 November 2009), Klay Anthony (born 21 May 2013), Kit Joseph (born 24 January 2016), and Cass Mac (born 15 February 2018). Kai Rooney signed with Manchester United in 2020, becoming a second-generation player for the Red Devils.

In 2004, Rooney admitted to soliciting prostitutes in Liverpool, while dating his then-girlfriend. &quot;I was young and stupid. It was at a time when I was very young and immature and before I had settled down with Coleen.&quot; In April 2006, Rooney was awarded £100,000 in libel damages from tabloids &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;News of the World&quot;, who had claimed that he had assaulted Coleen in a nightclub. Rooney donated the money to charity.

Rooney&#x27;s younger brother, John Rooney, is also a professional footballer who plays for Macclesfield. Rooney&#x27;s cousin, Tommy Rooney, played for Macclesfield Town in 2004. Another cousin, Jake Rooney, is also a professional footballer for Derby County.

=== Commercial interests ===
Rooney has had endorsement deals with Nike, Nokia, Ford, Asda, and Coca-Cola. He appeared on seven consecutive UK-version covers of Electronic Arts&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series from &quot;FIFA 06&quot; to &quot;FIFA 12&quot;. His &quot;knockout&quot; goal celebration – a tongue in cheek celebration by Rooney inspired by getting knocked out by his ex teammate Phil Bardsley in his home – appears in &quot;FIFA 18&quot;. He has featured in Nike commercials, including Write the Future directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu in 2010 where he is knighted, and a tabloid shows his face carved into the Cliffs of Dover with the headline &quot;JUST ROO IT!&quot;. In October 2010, Rooney was dropped by Coca-Cola from an advertising campaign following issues surrounding his private life. In 2012, Rooney&#x27;s reported income of US$32.6 million listed him as the world&#x27;s fifth highest-paid footballer, following Lionel Messi, David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Samuel Eto&#x27;o.

In July 2011, jerseys with Rooney&#x27;s name and number (Rooney, 10) were the best-selling sports product under the auspices of the Premier League – taking over top spot from Liverpool striker Fernando Torres (Torres, 9) and becoming the first United player to top the list since Cristiano Ronaldo&#x27;s number 7 jersey in 2008. During the 2009–10 season, Manchester United sold between 1.2 million and 1.5 million shirts and it is estimated that of that, Rooney&#x27;s name was printed on several hundred thousand. The account is taken from official jerseys sales across the globe, not just in England.

On 9 March 2006, Rooney signed what was, at the time, the largest sports book deal in publishing history with HarperCollins, who granted him a £5 million advance plus royalties for a minimum of five books to be published over a 12-year period. The first, &quot;My Story So Far&quot;, an autobiography ghostwritten by Hunter Davies, was published after the 2006 World Cup. The second publication, &quot;The Official Wayne Rooney Annual&quot;, was aimed at the teenage market and edited by football journalist Chris Hunt. His third book, &quot;My Decade in the Premier League&quot;, was published in September 2012.

In July 2006, Rooney&#x27;s lawyers went to the United Nations&#x27; World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to gain ownership of the Internet domain names waynerooney.com and waynerooney.co.uk, both of which Welsh actor Huw Marshall registered in 2002. Three months later, the WIPO awarded Rooney the rights to &quot;waynerooney.com.&quot;

=== Social media ===
In October 2014, Rooney became the first Premier League footballer to reach 10 million followers on social networking site Twitter. That same month, Rooney was the fifth-most-followed footballer (and sixth-most-followed sportsperson) globally on Twitter. In terms of top UK Twitter individuals, Rooney ranked at number 9 in October 2014.

=== Paul Stretford controversy ===
In July 2002, while Rooney was with Everton, agent Paul Stretford encouraged Rooney and his parents to enter the player into an eight-year contract with Proactive Sports Management. However, Rooney was already with another representation firm at the time, while Stretford&#x27;s transaction went unreported to the FA, and he was thus charged with improper conduct. Stretford alleged in his October 2004 trial that he had secretly recorded boxing promoter John Hyland and two other men threatening and attempting to blackmail him for an undisclosed percentage of Rooney&#x27;s earnings.

Stretford&#x27;s case collapsed due to evidence that conflicted with his insistence that he had not signed Rooney, and on 9 July 2008, he was found guilty of &quot;making of false and/or misleading witness statements to police, and giving false and/or misleading testimony&quot;. In addition, the contract to which Stretford had signed Rooney was two years longer than the limit allowed by the FA. Stretford was fined £300,000 and given an 18-month ban as a football agent, a verdict he appealed.

Stretford left Proactive in 2008 and took Rooney with him. Proactive later sued Rooney, claiming £4.3 million in withheld commissions. In July 2010, Proactive was awarded £90,000 as restitution.

=== David Moyes ===
On 1 September 2006, then-Everton manager David Moyes sued Rooney for libel after the tabloid newspaper the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published excerpts from Rooney&#x27;s 2006 autobiography that accused the manager of leaking Rooney&#x27;s reasons for leaving the club to the press. The case was settled out of court for £500,000 on 3 June 2008, and Rooney apologised to Moyes for &quot;false claims&quot; he had made in the book regarding the matter.

=== Allegations of infidelity ===
Helen Wood claims Rooney paid £1,000 for a threesome with her and Jennifer Thompson in a Manchester hotel while his wife was five months pregnant. It was reported his solicitors unsuccessfully tried to fight the allegations when they first surfaced in early August 2010.

=== Legal issues ===
==== Drink-driving conviction ====
On 1 September 2017, Rooney was arrested in Wilmslow by Cheshire police after being caught driving over the prescribed alcohol limit. He appeared at Stockport Magistrates&#x27; Court on 18 September and pleaded guilty to drink driving. Rooney was fined £170 by the court and banned from driving for two years, and was ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work as part of a twelve-month community order; Everton fined him two weeks&#x27; wages, which was in the region of £300,000.

==== Intoxication and profanity arrest ====

On 16 December 2018, Rooney was arrested at Washington Dulles International Airport in Loudoun County, Virginia, charged with public intoxication and use of profanity in public. He was released without bail on a personal recognizance bond, then fined $25 plus $91 in costs without going to court.

<text>The Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, also known as Soviet Kazakhstan, the Kazakh SSR, KSSR, or simply Kazakhstan, was one of the transcontinental constituent republics of the Soviet Union (USSR) from 1936 to 1991. Located in northern Central Asia, it was created on 5 December 1936 from the Kazakh ASSR, an autonomous republic of the Russian SFSR.

At in area, it was the second-largest republic in the USSR, after the Russian SFSR. Its capital was Alma-Ata (today known as Almaty). During its existence as a Soviet Socialist Republic, it was ruled by the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR (QKP).

On 25 October 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR declared its sovereignty on its soil. QKP first secretary Nursultan Nazarbayev was elected president in April of that year – a role he remained in until 2019.

The Kazakh SSR was renamed the Republic of Kazakhstan on 10 December 1991, which declared its independence six days later, as the last republic to secede from the USSR on 16 December 1991. The Soviet Union was officially dissolved on 26 December 1991 by the Soviet of the Republics. The Republic of Kazakhstan, the legal successor to the Kazakh SSR, was admitted to the United Nations on 2 March 1992.

==Name==
The republic was named after the Kazakh people, Turkic-speaking former nomads who sustained a powerful khanate in the region before Russian and later Soviet domination.

==History==
===Formation===
Established on 26 August 1920, it was initially called Kirghiz ASSR (Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic) and was a part of the Russian SFSR. On 15–19 April 1925, it was renamed Kazak ASSR (subsequently Kazakh ASSR) and on 5 December 1936 it was elevated to the status of a Union-level republic, Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic.

In September 1920, the Ninth Soviet Congress of Turkestan called for the deportation of illegal settler colonists in the Northern parts of the country. The proposed land reform began in 1921 and lasted until 1927,targeting Russian settlers, Ukrainians and Cossacks in the region and from 1920 to 1922, Kazakhstan&#x27;s Russian population dropped from approximately 2.7 to 2.2 million. A further 15,000 Cossack settler colonists were deported between 1920 and 1921 as part of the process of returning control and sovereignty of land to the Kazakhs.

On 19 February 1925 Filipp Goloshchyokin was appointed First Secretary of the Communist Party in the newly created Kazakh Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic. From 1925 to 1933 he ran the Kazakh ASSR with virtually no outside interference. He played a prominent part in the construction of the Turkestan-Siberia railway, which was constructed to open up Kazakhstan&#x27;s mineral wealth.

After Joseph Stalin ordered the forced collectivization of agriculture throughout the Soviet Union, Goloshchyokin ordered that Kazakhstan&#x27;s largely nomadic population was to be forced to settle in collective farms. This caused the deadly Kazakh famine of 1930–1933 in Kazakhstan which killed between 1 and 2 million people.

In 1937 the first major deportation of an ethnic group in the Soviet Union began, the removal of the Korean population from the Russian Far East to Kazakhstan. Over 170,000 people were forcibly relocated to the Kazakh and Uzbek SSRs.

Kazakhstani Korean scholar German Kim assumes that one of the reasons for this deportation may have been Stalin&#x27;s intent to oppress ethnic minorities that could have posed a threat to his socialist system or he may have intended to consolidate the border regions with China and Japan by using them as political bargaining chips. Additionally, historian Kim points out that 1.7 million people perished in the Kazakh famine of 1931–33, while an additional one million people fled from the Republic, causing a labour shortage in that area, which Stalin sought to compensate for by deporting other ethnicities there.

Over one million political prisoners from various parts of the Soviet Union passed through the Karaganda Corrective Labor Camp (KarLag) between 1931 and 1959, with an unknown number of deaths.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Soviet citizens were urged to settle in the Virgin Lands of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. The influx of immigrants, mostly Russians, skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled non-Kazakhs to outnumber natives. As a result, the use of the Kazakh language declined but has started to experience a revival since independence, both as a result of its resurging popularity in law and business and the growing proportion of Kazakhs. The other nationalities included Ukrainians, Germans, Jews, Belarusians, Koreans and others; Germans at the time of independence formed about 8% of the population, the largest concentration of Germans in the entire Soviet Union. Kazakh independence has caused many of these newcomers to emigrate.

===Dissolution===
Following the dismissal of Dinmukhamed Konayev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan by the last Soviet general secretary, Mikhail Gorbachev, riots broke out for four days between 16 and 19 December 1986 known as Jeltoqsan by student demonstrators in Brezhnev Square in the capital city, Alma-Ata. Approximately 168–200 civilians were killed in the uprising. The events then spilled over to Shymkent, Pavlodar, Karaganda and Taldykorgan.

On 25 March 1990, Kazakhstan held its first elections with Nursultan Nazarbayev, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet elected as its first president. Later that year on 25 October, it then declared sovereignty. The republic participated in a referendum to preserve the union in a different entity with 94.1% voted in favour. It did not happen when hardline communists in Moscow took control of the government in August. Nazarbayev then condemned the failed coup.

As a result of those events, the Kazakh SSR was renamed to the Republic of Kazakhstan on 10 December 1991. It declared independence on 16 December (the fifth anniversary of Jeltoqsan), becoming the last Soviet constituency to secede. Its capital was the site of the Alma-Ata Protocol on 21 December 1991 that dissolved the Soviet Union and formed the Commonwealth of Independent States in its place which Kazakhstan joined. The Soviet Union officially ceased to exist as a sovereign state on 26 December 1991 and Kazakhstan became an internationally recognized independent state.

On 28 January 1993, the new Constitution of Kazakhstan was officially adopted.

==Population==

According to the 1897 census, the earliest census taken in the region, Kazakhs constituted 81.7% of the total population (3,392,751 people) within the territory of contemporary Kazakhstan. The Russian population in Kazakhstan was 454,402, or 10.95% of total population; there were 79,573 Ukrainians (1.91%); 55,984 Tatars (1.34%); 55,815 Uyghurs (1.34%); 29,564 Uzbeks (0.7%); 11,911 Moldovans (0.28%); 4,888 Dungans (0.11%); 2,883 Turkmens; 2,613 Germans; 2,528 Bashkirs; 1,651 Jews; and 1,254 Poles.

=== Famines ===
The most significant factors that shaped the ethnic composition of the population of Kazakhstan were the 1920s and 1930s famines. According to different estimates of the effects of the Kazakh famine of 1930–1933, up to 40% of Kazakhs (indigenous ethnic group) either died of starvation or fled the territory. Official government census data report the contraction of Kazakh population from 3.6 million in 1926, to 2.3 million in 1939.

==Economy==
Upon the start of the Second World War, many large factories were relocated to the Kazakh SSR.

The Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site and Baikonur Cosmodrome were also built here.

After the war, the Virgin Lands Campaign was started in 1953. This was led by Nikita Khrushchev, with the goal of developing the vast lands of the republic and helping to boost Soviet agricultural yields. However it did not work as promised, the campaign was eventually abandoned in the 1960s.

==Culture==
In the early days of the Soviet Union, Kazakh culture was both developed and restrained, and later many Kazakh cultural figures were imprisoned, exiled, or killed in Joseph Stalin&#x27;s purges. However, after the Stalinist era, Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s efforts to reinvigorate internationalism and furtherly weaken Kazakh culture were controversial in the Kazakh SSR. Kazakhs viewed his internationalist goals as a call for &quot;Russification&quot;.

Beginning in 1937, the Soviet Government began a series of forced deportations of ethnic minorities, such as Soviet Koreans, the Volga Germans and various other minorities to the Kazakh SSR, a programme that ended only with Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953.

<text>Töretam (; ) is a station on the Trans-Aral Railway, located in Kazakhstan. The name means &quot;Töre&#x27;s grave&quot; in the Kazakh language. Töre, or more formally, Töre-Baba, was a nobleman and descendant of Genghis Khan. Töretam is near the Baikonur Cosmodrome, a Russianformerly Sovietspaceport, and near the city of Baikonur (formerly Leninsk, Baiqongyr in Kazakh), which was constructed to service the cosmodrome.

==History==
In the mid-1950s, the Soviet Union announced that space activities were being conducted from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, which was assumed to be near the mining village of Baikonur, in the Kazakh SSR. The naming was a bit of misdirection as the launch facilities were located to the southwest at Töretam. At a press conference for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, Jules Bergman of ABC News said to astronaut Thomas P. Stafford,
Baikonur, if you&#x27;ll look on the coordinates, is 135 miles [217 km] away or something. Tyuratam may only be a railhead, but it is the Tyuratam Launch Complex. They call it Baikonur, I know. . . . I&#x27;m going to call it Tyuratam. ABC is going to call it Tyuratam. SAC calls it Tyuratam. Can we once and for all straighten that out and arrive at a . . . name for it, Tom?
Deke Slayton said if they wanted to use the name the Soviets commonly used, they would have to say Baikonur. Although it is likely the Soviets originally called it Baikonur to hide its location, the Baikonur Cosmodrome quickly surpassed the original village of Baikonur&#x27;s fame and importance. In 1995, the city that was founded to the south of Töretam to support the cosmodrome, originally named Leninsk by the Soviets, was officially renamed to Baikonur (Baiqongyr in Kazakh), after the cosmodrome.

The CIA tried to locate this launch site by systematically tracking over the major rail networks of the Soviet Union in Central Asia with U-2 spy planes. The site was discovered and photographed in 1957. Francis Gary Powers was scheduled to fly over it on his ill-fated mission in 1960.

<text>The information industry or information industries are industries that are information intensive in one way or the other. It is considered one of the most important economic branches for a variety of reasons.

There are many different kinds of information industries, and many different ways to classify them. Although there is no standard or distinctively better way of organizing those different views, the following section offers a review of what the term &quot;information industry&quot; might entail, and why. Alternative conceptualizations are that of knowledge industry and information-related occupation. The term &quot;information industry&quot; is mostly identified with computer programming, system design, telecommunications, and others.

==Information products==

First, there are companies which produce and sell information in the form of goods or services. Media products such as television programs and movies, published books and periodicals would constitute probably among the most accepted part of what information goods can be. Some information is provided not as a tangible commodity but as a service. Consulting is among the least controversial of this kind. However, even for this category, disagreements can occur due to the vagueness of the term &quot;information.&quot; For some, information is knowledge about a subject, something one can use to improve the performance of other activities—it does not include arts and entertainments. For others, information is something that is mentally processed and consumed, either to improve other activities (such as production) or for personal enjoyment; it would include artists and architects. For yet others, information may include anything that has to do with sensation, and therefore information industries may include even such things as restaurant, amusement parks, and prostitution to the extent that food, park ride, and sexual intercourse have to do with senses. In spite of the definitional problems, industries producing information goods and services are called information industries.

==Information services==

Second, there are information processing services. Some services, such as legal services, banking, insurance, computer programming, data processing, testing, and market research, require intensive and intellectual processing of information. Although those services do not necessarily provide information, they often offer expertise in making decisions on behalf of clients. These kinds of service industries can be regarded as an information-intensive part of various industries that is externalized and specialized.

==Information distribution==

Third, there are industries that are vital to the dissemination of the information goods mentioned above. For example, telephone, broadcasting and book retail industries do not produce much information, but their core business is to disseminate information others produced. These industries handle predominantly information and can be distinguished from wholesale or retail industries in general. It is just a coincidence, one can argue, that some of those industries are separately existing from the more obvious information-producing industries. For example, in the United States, as well as some other countries, broadcasting stations produce a very limited number of programs they broadcast. But this is not the only possible form of division of labor. If legal, economic, cultural, and historical circumstances were different, the broadcasters would have been the producers of their own programs. Therefore, in order to capture the information related activities of the economy, it might be a good idea to include this type of industry. These industries show how much of an economy is about information, as opposed to materials. It is useful to differentiate production of valuable information from processing that information in a sophisticated way, from the movement of information.

==Information devices==

Fourth, there are manufacturers of information-processing devices that require research and sophisticated decision-making. These products are vital to information-processing activities of above mentioned industries. The products include computers of various levels and many other microelectronic devices, as well as software programs. Printing and copying machines, measurement and recording devices of various kinds, electronic or otherwise, are also in this category. The role of these tools are to automate certain information-processing activities. The use of some of these tools may be very simple (as in the case of some printing), and the processing done by the tools may be very simple (as in copying and some calculations) rather than intellectual and sophisticated. In other words, the specialization of these industries in an economy is neither production of information nor sophisticated decision-making. Instead, this segment serves as an infrastructure for those activities, making production of information and decision-making services to be a lot more efficient. In addition, these industries tend to be &quot;high-tech&quot; or research intensive - trying to find more efficient ways to boost efficiency of information production and sophisticated decision-making. For example, the function of a standard calculator is quite simple and it is easy to learn how to use it. However, manufacturing a well-functioning standard calculator takes a lot of processes, many with more sophisticated or specialized knowledge required, far more than the task of calculation performed by the users.

==Research industries==

Fifth, there are very research-intensive industries that do not serve as infrastructure to information-production or sophisticated decision-making. Pharmaceutical, food-processing, some apparel design, and some other &quot;high-tech&quot; industries belong to this type. These products are not exclusively for information production or sophisticated decision-making, although many are helpful. Some services, such as medical examination are in this category as well. One can say these industries involve a great deal of sophisticated decision-making, although that part is combined with manufacturing or &quot;non-informational&quot; activities.

==Infrastructure==

Finally, there are industries that are not research intensive, but serve as infrastructure for information production and sophisticated decision-making. Manufacturing of office furniture would be a good example, although it sometimes involves research in ergonomics and development of new materials.

As stated above, this list of candidates for information industries is not a definitive way of organizing differences that researchers may pay attention to when they define the term. Among the difficulties is, for example, the position of advertising industry.

==Importance==

Information industries are considered important for several reasons. Even among the experts who think industries are important, disagreements may exist regarding which reason to accept and which to reject.

First, information industries is a rapidly growing part of economy. The demand for information goods and services from consumers is increasing. In case of consumers, media including music and motion picture, personal computers, video game-related industries, are among the information industries. In case of businesses, information industries include computer programming, system design, so-called FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate) industries, telecommunications, and others. When demand for these industries are growing nationally or internationally, that creates an opportunity for an urban, regional, or national economy to grow rapidly by specializing on these sectors.

Second, information industries are considered to boost innovation and productivity of other industries. An economy with a strong information industry might be a more competitive one than others, other factors being equal.

Third, some believe that the effect of the changing economic structure (or composition of industries within an economy) is related to the broader social change. As information becomes the central part of our economic activities we evolve into an &quot;information society&quot;, with an increased role of mass media, digital technologies, and other mediated information in our daily life, leisure activities, social life, work, politics, education, art, and many other aspects of society.

<text>The 9K32 Strela-2 (; NATO reporting name SA-7 Grail) is a light-weight, shoulder-fired, surface-to-air missile or MANPADS system. It is designed to target aircraft at low altitudes with passive infrared-homing guidance and destroy them with a high-explosive warhead.

Broadly comparable in performance with the US Army FIM-43 Redeye, the Strela-2 was the first Soviet man-portable SAM – full-scale production began in 1970. While the Redeye and 9K32 Strela-2 were similar, the missiles were not identical.

The Strela-2 was a staple of the Cold War and was produced in huge numbers for the Soviet Union and their allies, as well as revolutionary movements. Though since surpassed by more modern systems, the Strela and its variants remain in service in many countries, and have seen use in nearly every regional conflict since 1972.

== Development ==
The end of World War II led to a major shift in Soviet defence policy. The advent of long range, high altitude, nuclear-armed American bombers, capable of penetrating Soviet airspace at heights and speeds unreachable and unmatchable by anti-aircraft guns and most interceptors, appeared to render every conventional weapon obsolete at a stroke. Numerous long-range, high-altitude SAM systems, such as the S-25 Berkut and S-75 Dvina, were rapidly developed and fielded to counter this large vulnerability. Due to the apparent obsolescence of conventional arms, however, relatively little development took place to field mobile battlefield air defences.

This direction was soon changed with the beginning of the Korean War. An entirely conventional conflict, it proved that nuclear weapons were not the be-all and end-all of warfare. In the face of a powerful and modern American air force, carrying non-nuclear payloads, the Soviet Union invested heavily in a multi-tier air defence system, consisting of several new mobile SAMs, to cover all altitude ranges and protect ground forces. The new doctrine listed five requirements:
* Front-level medium-to-high-altitude area defense system 9K8 Krug (NATO designation SA-4 &quot;Ganef&quot;)
* Army-level low-to-medium-range area defense system 3K9 Kub (NATO designation SA-6 &quot;Gainful&quot;)
* Division-level low-altitude short-range system 9K33 Osa (NATO designation SA-8 &quot;Gecko&quot;)
* Regiment-level all-weather radar-guided gun system ZSU-23-4 &quot;Shilka&quot; and very-short-range missile systems 9K31 Strela-1 (NATO designation SA-9 &quot;Gaskin&quot;)
* Battalion-level man-portable 9K32 Strela-2 (NATO designation SA-7 &quot;Grail&quot;)
Both Strela-1 and Strela-2 were initially intended to be man-portable systems. As the Strela-2 proved to be a considerably smaller and lighter package, however, the role of the Strela-1 was changed, becoming a heavier, vehicle-mounted system with increased range and performance to better support the ZSU-23-4 in the regimental air defense role.
As development began in the Turopov OKB (later changed to Kolomna), detailed information on the design of the US FIM-43 Redeye became available. While it was not a reverse-engineered copy, in many ways the Strela design borrowed heavily from the Redeye, which had started development a few years earlier. Due to the comparatively primitive Soviet technical base, development was protracted, and many problems arose, especially in designing a sufficiently small seeker head and rocket. Eventually, the designers settled for a simpler seeker head than that of the Redeye, allowing the initial version, the 9K32 &quot;Strela-2&quot; (US DoD designation &quot;SA-7A&quot;, missile round 9M32) to finally enter service in 1968, five years behind schedule. At the time, it was described by one expert as being &quot;the premier Russian export line&quot;.

=== Improvements ===
The initial variant suffered from numerous shortcomings: it could only engage targets flying at relatively slow airspeeds and low altitudes and then only from rear hemisphere, it suffered from poor guidance reliability (particularly in the presence of natural or man-made background IR radiation sources), and even when a hit was achieved, it often failed to destroy the target. Poor lethality was an issue especially when used against jet aircraft: the hottest part of the target was the nozzle behind the actual engine, which the missile therefore usually hit; but there its small warhead often failed to cause significant damage to the engine itself.

In order to address the shortcomings, two improved versions were ordered in 1968; as an intermediate stop-gap the slightly improved 9K32M &quot;Strela-2M&quot; (NATO reporting name SA-7b) to replace the original, as well as the more ambitious Strela-3.
As the modifications introduced with the Strela-2M were relatively minor, the process was fast and it was accepted in service in 1970. The Strela-2M replaced the Strela-2 in production lines immediately. Improvements were made particularly to increase the engagement envelope of the new system:
* Higher thrust propellant increased slant range from and ceiling from 
* Improved guidance and control logic allowed the engagement of helicopters and propeller-driven aircraft (but not jets) approaching at a maximum speed of 
* Maximum speed of receding targets was increased from 
* More automated gripstock provided a simplified firing method against fast targets: a single trigger pull followed by lead and superelevation replacing the separate stages of releasing the seeker to track, and launching the missile (see description below)

Contrary to what was initially reported in some Western publications, more recent information indicates that, while lethality on impact had proven to be a problem, the warhead remained the same unit (including TNT charge) as in the original. This remained the warhead of all Soviet MANPADS up to and including most 9K38 Igla variants; to address the problem of poor lethality, a more powerful HE filling than TNT, improved fuzing, a terminal maneuver, and finally a separate charge to set off any remaining rocket fuel were gradually introduced in later MANPADS systems, but the original Strela-2/2M warhead design of a directed-energy HE charge in a pre-fragmented casing remained.

The seeker head improvements were only minor changes to allow better discrimination of the target signal against background emissions. Some sources claim that the seeker sensitivity was also improved. The only defence against infra-red countermeasures remained the seeker head&#x27;s narrow field of view, which could be hoped to help the rapidly slowing flare fall off the missile field of view as it was tracking a fast-moving target. In practice, flares proved to be a highly effective countermeasure against both versions of the Strela-2.

The seeker is commonly referred to as a hot metal tracker. The seeker can only see infrared energy in the near infrared (NIR) spectrum, emitted by very hot surfaces only seen on the inside of the jet nozzle. This allows only rear-aspect engagement of jet targets, earning the weapon its other moniker as a revenge weapon, since the missile has to &quot;chase&quot; an aircraft after it has already passed by.

The Strela-2M was also procured for use on-board Warsaw Pact warships; installed on four-round pedestal mounts aboard Soviet amphibious warfare vessels and various smaller combatants, the weapon remained unchanged, but was assigned the NATO reporting name SA-N-5 &quot;Grail&quot;.

== Description ==
The missile launcher system consists of the green missile launch tube containing the missile, a grip stock and a cylindrical thermal battery. The launch tube is reloadable at depot, but missile rounds are delivered to fire units in their launch tubes. The device can be reloaded up to five times.
When engaging slow or straight-receding targets, the operator tracks the target with the iron sights in the launch tube and applies half-trigger. This action &quot;uncages&quot; the seeker and allows its attempt to track. If a target IR signature can be tracked against the background present, this is indicated by a light and a buzzer sound. The shooter then pulls the trigger fully, and immediately applies lead and superelevation. This method is called a manual engagement. An automatic mode, which is used against fast targets, allows the shooter to fully depress the trigger in one pull followed by immediate lead and superelevation of the launch tube. The seeker will uncage and will automatically launch the missile if a strong enough signal is detected.

The manufacturer lists reaction time measured from the carrying position (missile carried on a soldier&#x27;s back with protective covers) to missile launch to be 13 seconds, a figure that is achievable but requires considerable training and skill in missile handling. With the launcher on the shoulder, covers removed and sights extended, reaction time from fire command to launch reduces to 6–10 seconds, depending greatly on the target difficulty and the shooter&#x27;s skill.

After activating the power supply to the missile electronics, the gunner waits for electricity supply and gyros to stabilize, puts the sights on target and tracks it smoothly with the launch tube&#x27;s iron sights, and pulls the trigger on the grip stock. This activates the seeker electronics and the missile attempts to lock onto the target. If the target is producing a strong enough signal and the angular tracking rate is within acceptable launch parameters, the missile alerts the gunner that the target is locked on by illuminating a light in the sight mechanism, and producing a constant buzzing noise. The operator then has 0.8 seconds to provide lead to the target while the missile&#x27;s on-board power supply is activated and the throw-out motor ignited.

Should the target be outside acceptable parameters, then the light cue in the sight and the buzzer signal tell the gunner to re-aim the missile.

On launch, the booster burns out before the missile leaves the launch tube at and rotating at around 20 revolutions per second. As the missile leaves the tube, the two forward steering fins unfold, as do the four rear stabilizing tail fins. The self-destruct mechanism is then armed, which is set to destroy the missile after between 14 and 17 seconds to prevent it hitting the ground if it should miss the target.
Once the missile is five and a half meters away from the gunner, about 0.3 seconds after leaving the launch tube, it activates the rocket sustainer motor. The sustainer motor takes it to a velocity of , and sustains it at this speed. Once it reaches peak speed, at a distance of around from the gunner, the final safety mechanism is disabled and the missile is fully armed. All told, the booster burns for 0.5 seconds and the driving engine for another 2.0 seconds.

The missile&#x27;s uncooled lead sulfide passive infra-red seeker head detects infrared radiation at below 2.8 μm in wavelength. It has a 1.9 degree field of view and can track at 9 degrees per second. The seeker head tracks the target with an amplitude-modulated spinning reticle (spin-scan or AM tracking), which attempts to keep the seeker constantly pointed towards the target. The spinning reticle measures the amount of incoming infrared (IR) energy. It does this by using a circular pattern that has solid portions and slats that allow the IR energy to pass through to the seeker. As the reticle spins IR energy passes through the open portions of the reticle. Based on where the IR energy falls on the reticle the amount or amplitude of IR energy allowed through to the seeker increases the closer to the center of the reticle. Therefore, the seeker is able to identify where the center of the IR energy is. If the seeker detects a decrease in the amplitude of the IR energy it steers the missile back towards where the IR energy was the strongest. The seeker&#x27;s design creates a dead-space in the middle of the reticle. The center mounted reticle has no detection capability. This means that as the seeker tracks a target as soon as the seeker is dead center, (aimed directly at the IR source) there is a decrease in the amplitude of IR energy. The seeker interprets this decrease as being off target so it changes direction. This causes the missile to move off target until another decrease in IR energy is detected and the process repeats itself. This gives the missile a very noticeable wobble in flight as the seeker bounces in and out from the dead-space. This wobble becomes more pronounced as the missile closes on the target as the IR energy fills a greater portion of the reticle. These continuous course corrections effectively bleed energy from the missile reducing its range and velocity.
The guidance of the SA-7 follows proportional convergence logic, also known as angle rate tracking system or pro-logic. In this method, as the seeker tracks the target, the missile is turned towards where the seeker is turning towards – not where it is pointing at – relative to the missile&#x27;s longitudinal axis. Against a target flying in a straight-line course at constant speed, the angle rate of seeker-to-body reduces to zero when the missile is in a straight-line flight path to intercept point.

== Combat use ==
As a consequence of their widespread availability and large numbers, the Strela system has seen use in conflicts across the globe.

=== Middle East ===
==== Egypt ====
The first combat use of the missile is credited as being in 1969 during the War of Attrition by Egyptian soldiers. The first &quot;kill&quot; was claimed on 19 August 1969. An Israeli 102 Squadron A-4H Skyhawk was hit with a shoulder-fired missile west of the Suez Canal and pilot SqL Nassim Ezer Ashkenazi captured. Between this first firing and June 1970 the Egyptian army fired 99 missiles resulting in 36 hits. The missile proved to have poor kinematic reach against combat jets, and also poor lethality as many aircraft that were hit managed to return safely to base.

The missile was used later in the Yom Kippur War, where 4,356 Strelas were fired, scoring few hits and just 2 to 4 kills, with 26 to 28 damaged. A-4s were fitted with lengthened exhaust pipes in order to prevent fatal damage to the engine, a solution made in the previous war, together with flare launchers. However, together with Shilka and SA-2/3/6s, they caused very heavy losses to the Israeli Air Force in the first days. Subsequently, Arab forces fired so many SAMs that they almost depleted their weapon stocks. SA-7s were not that effective against fast jets, but they were the best weapon available to Arab infantry at the time.

A Strela 2 was reportedly used by the Islamist militant group Ansar Bait al-Maqdis to destroy an Egyptian military Mil-8 helicopter operating in the northern Sinai region on 26 January 2014 near Sheikh Zuweid (close to the border with Gaza), killing its five occupants. This is the first attack of this type during the Sinai insurgency, which has raged on the peninsula due to the security and political turmoil since the 2011 revolution. The MANPADS is reported by United Nations to have come from former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s large stocks, which have been widely proliferated after Libya&#x27;s civil war chaos and have become a concern to regional and world security.

==== Syria ====
The Strela was deployed by Syrian forces occupying Lebanon, along with other Soviet air-defence systems that challenged U.S., French and Israeli airpower in the aftermath of the 1982 conflict and the deployment of the Multinational Force in Lebanon during that year. On 10 November 1983, an SA-7 was fired at a French Super Etendard near Bourj el-Barajneh while flying over Druze People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) positions. On 3 December, more Strelas and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) were fired at United States Navy F-14 Tomcats flying a reconnaissance mission.

The Americans responded with a large strike package of 12 A-7 Corsairs and 16 A-6 Intruders (supported by a single E-2C Hawkeye, two EA-6B Prowlers and two F-14As) launched from the carriers and sailing in the Mediterranean. The aircraft were to bomb Syrian installations, AAA sites and weapons depots near Falouga and Hammana, some north of Beirut-Damascus highway, when they were received by a volley of (possibly up to 40) Syrian SAMs, one of which hit a Corsair (AE305 of the VA-15), forcing the pilot to eject over the sea before being rescued by a USN search and rescue mission.

The attack formation broke, with each pilot attacking each objective on its own, leading to the downing of a second U.S. aircraft, an Intruder from VA-85, hit by either an SA-7 or an SA-9. The navigator, Lieutenant Bobby Goodman ejected near a village surrounded by Syrian positions. The pilot, Lt. Mark Lange, ejected too late and died from his wounds soon after being captured by Syrian soldiers and Lebanese civilians. Goodman was captured by the Syrians and taken to Damascus before being freed in January 1984.

A second Corsair, searching for the downed Intruder crew, was later hit by an SA-7. The pilot, Cdr. Edward Andrews, managed to eject over the sea near Beirut and was rescued by a fisherman and his son who in turn handed him over to the U.S Marines.

During the civil war, several Strelas have made their way to rebel hands, and YouTube videos have shown them being fired. In 2013, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, citing rebels sources, reported the shipment, with Qatari help, of some 120 SA-7s from Libya (with large stocks acquired by Gaddafi and proliferated after that country&#x27;s civil war) through Turkey and with Turkish authorities’ knowledge.

==== Lebanon ====
On 24 June 1974, Palestinian guerrillas operating in southern Lebanon fired two SA-7s against invading Israel Air Force (IAF) aircraft, though no hits were scored.

The Lebanese Al-Mourabitoun militia received either from Syria or the PLO a number of SA-7s, which they employed against Israeli Air Force (IAF) fighter-bomber jets during the 1982 Lebanon War.

During the 1983–84 Mountain War, the Druze People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) militia received from Syria a number of Strela missiles, which were used to bring down two Lebanese Air Force Hawker Hunter fighter jets and one Israeli IAI Kfir fighter-bomber aircraft, on 20 November over the mountainous Chouf district southeast of Beirut (the pilot was rescued by the Lebanese Army). The Christian Maronite Lebanese Forces militia (LF) also received from Iraq a number of Strela missiles in 1988–89.

The Shiite Hezbollah guerrilla group also acquired some Strelas in the late 1980s and fired them against Israeli aircraft in November 1991. Since then, they have since fired many Strelas against Israeli aircraft, including two against Israeli warplanes on 12 June 2001 near Tyre, but have never scored a hit.

==== Iraq ====
In the early dawn of 31 January 1991 during the Battle of Khafji in Operation Desert Storm, an Iraqi soldier shot down an American AC-130H gunship with a Strela 2, killing all 14 crewmembers.

Strela-2 missiles have been used against Turkish Army helicopters by the PKK in northern Iraq. During Operation Hammer; on 18 May 1997, a Strela-2 missile was used to shoot down an AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter. On 4 June 1997, another Strela was used to bring down a Turkish Army AS-532UL Cougar transport helicopter in the Zakho area, killing the 11 soldiers on board. The video of the first attack was used extensively for PKK propaganda and eventually released to the Internet. Greece and Serbia&#x27;s intelligence services, as well as Iran, Syria, Armenia, and Cyprus were traced as possible sources of the missiles.

A Strela-2 missile is said to have been used in April 2005, when members of the insurgents shot down an Mi-8 helicopter operated by Blackwater, killing all 11 crew members. The Islamic Army in Iraq took responsibility for the action and a video showing the downing was released on the Internet. The missile launcher is not visible on the video, however, making it impossible to confirm the type of MANPADS used.

The spate of helicopter shoot-downs during 2006 and 2007 in Iraq has been partly attributed to the prevalence of the Strela amongst Sunni insurgent groups of that time; while al Qaeda is said to have produced an hour-long training video on how to use SA-7s.

==== Saudi Arabia ====
In late 2001, a Sudanese man with links to Al-Qaida fired an SA-7 at an American F-15 Eagle fighter taking off from Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia. The missile missed the target and was not detected by the pilot or anyone at the base. Saudi police found the empty launcher in the desert in May 2002, and a suspect was arrested in Sudan a month later. He led police to a cache in the desert where a second missile was buried.

==== Gaza ====
During October 2012, militants in Gaza fired a Strela at an IDF helicopter. During Operation Pillar of Defense, Hamas released a video purporting to be a Strela missile launch at an IAF target. In March 2013, one was also reportedly fired from Gaza at an IAF helicopter.

In 2022 one was fired at IAF F16 to stop an air raid.

In April 2023, a video released by the armed wing of Hamas showed the simultaneous launches of three missiles towards an IAF aircraft after it had downed a locally produced drone over the southern Gaza Strip. in October 2023, Hamas claimed to have used these missiles to down an IAF helicopter during the Israel–Hamas war.

==== Yemen ====
Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula allegedly shot down a UAE Mirage fighter jet with a Strela during the Yemeni Civil War (2014–present). Houthi rebels were seen carrying 9K32 Strela-2s.

=== Southeast Asia ===

The Strela-2 system was also given to North Vietnam, where along with the more advanced Strela-2M it achieved 204 hits out of 589 firings against US and South Vietnamese aircraft between 1972 and 1975 according to Russian sources. (Some sources, such as Fiszer (2004), claim that it was used from 1968 onwards).

Roughly 95–120 kills and several dozen damaged are attributed to Strela-2/2M hits between April 1972 and the Fall of Saigon in April 1975, almost all against helicopters and propeller-driven aircraft. As in the War of Attrition, the missile&#x27;s speed and range proved insufficient against fast jets and results were poor: only one U.S. A-4 Skyhawk, one U.S. F-4 Phantom and three South Vietnamese F-5 Freedom Fighter are known to have been shot down with Strela-2s during the conflict.

U.S. fixed-wing losses are listed in the following table. The internet site Arms-expo.ru states 14 fixed-wing aircraft and 10 helicopters were shot down with 161 missile rounds used between 28 April and 14 July 1972. Between April 1972 and January 1973, 29 fixed-wing aircraft and 14 helicopters were shot down (01 F-4, 7 O-1, 03 O-2, 04 OV-10, 09 A-1, 04 A-37, 01 CH-47, 04 AH-1, 09 UH-1) The difference in fixed-wing losses may be at least partly due to South Vietnamese aircraft shot down by the weapon.

The table shows heavy losses particularly in the beginning of May, with especially lethal results on the 1st and 2nd, where the shootdown of the O-2 FAC led to further losses when a rescue operation was attempted. After these initial losses, changes in tactics and widespread introduction of decoy flares helped to counter the threat, but a steady flow of attrition and necessity of minimizing time spent in the Strela&#x27;s engagement envelope nonetheless continued to limit the effectiveness of US battlefield air operations until the end of US involvement in South-East Asia. The United States lost at least 10 AH-1 Cobras and several UH-1 Hueys to Strela-2/2M hits in South East Asia.

From 28 January 1973 to July 1973, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force lost 8 aircraft and helicopter with 22 missile rounds used (1 A-37, 3 A-1, 1 F-5, 2 UH-1, 1 CH-47) From January 1973 to December 1974, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force lost at least 28 planes and helicopters to Strela-2s.

In 1975 spring offensive, a few dozen aircraft and helicopter were shot down by SA-7s. On 14 April, one F-5 was shot down In Ho Chi Minh campaign, PAVN claimed 34 aircraft and helicopter were shot down by SA-7s, including 9 on 29 April

Vietnam claims that throughout the war, PAVN gunner Hoàng Văn Quyết fired 30 missiles and shotdown 16 aircraft.

In the late 1980s, Strela-2s were used against Royal Thai Air Force aircraft by Laotian and Vietnamese forces during numerous border clashes. An RTAF F-5E was damaged on 4 March 1987 and another F-5E was shot down on 4 February 1988 near the Thai-Cambodian border.

=== Western Asia ===
==== Afghanistan ====
In 1977, the Republic of Afghanistan received the Strela-2M for use by the Afghan Army. The Strela-2M was used also in Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War by the Mujahiddeen. The missiles were obtained from various sources, some from Egypt and China (locally manufactured Sakr Eye and HN-5 versions of the SAM), and the CIA also assisted the guerrillas in finding missiles from other sources.

Results from combat use were not dissimilar from experiences with the Strela-2/2M from Vietnam: while 42 helicopters were shot down by various Strela-2 variants (including a few Mi-24s until exhaust shrouds made them next to invisible to the short-wavelength Strela-2 seeker) only five fixed-wing aircraft were destroyed with the weapon. Due to its poor kinematic performance and vulnerability to even the most primitive infra-red countermeasures, the guerrillas considered the Strela-2 suitable for use against helicopters and prop-driven transports, but not combat jets.

However, the recent studies and interviews after the Cold war say that most Strelas sold to the Mujahiddeen on the black market were broken/damaged or faulty. This is possibly another reason why the Soviet army in Afghanistan didn&#x27;t expect working anti-aircraft missiles like the Stinger to be used.

On 22 July 2007 the first reported attack of the Taliban against a coalition aircraft using MANPADS was reported. The weapon was reported to be an SA-7 allegedly smuggled from Iran to the Taliban. The missile failed after the crew of the USAF C-130, flying over the Nimroz province, launched flares and made evasive manoeuvers.

However, most of the Strelas operated by al-Qaeda in Afghanistan are probably inherited from fighters that used it during the Soviet invasion. Most are probably faulty, broken or in other ways not usable (even from the beginning) against military helicopters, with the intercepts of NATO aviation by Stingers (acquired also during 80s) or other missiles.

==== Chechnya ====
Chechen forces had access to old Soviet stockpiles of Strela-2M and Igla missiles, as well former Soviet Army personnel trained to operate them. In the First Chechen war Russian forces lost about 38 aircraft of which 15 were caused by MANPADS with another 10 probably caused by MANPADS, while the rest were caused by other anti-aircraft weapons. During the Second Chechen war the Russians lost 45 helicopters and 8 fixed-wing aircraft, the majority presumably caused by MANPADS.

==== Georgia ====
The SA-7 saw heavy usage by all sides during the Georgian Civil War. The first known loss to an SA-7 happened on 13 June 1993, when a GAF Su-25 was shot down by a Strela over Shubara. On two later occasions, Georgian airliners (a Tu-134A and a Tu-134B) were shot down by SA-7s, killing a total of 110 people.

=== Africa ===
==== Guinea-Bissau ====
PAIGC rebels fighting for independence from Portugal began to receive SA-7s in early 1973, a development that immediately became a threat to Portuguese air supremacy. On 23 March 1973, two Portuguese Air Force (FAP) Fiat G.91s were shot down by SA-7s, followed six weeks later by another Fiat, and a Dornier Do 27.

==== Mozambique ====
FRELIMO fighters in Mozambique were also able to field some SA-7s with Chinese support, although the weapon is not known to have caused any losses to the FAP, even if it forced Portuguese pilots to change their tactics. In one case a Douglas DC-3 carrying foreign military attaches and members of the senior Portuguese military command was hit by an SA-7 in one of the engines. The crippled plane managed to land safely and was later repaired.

==== Angola ====
In Angola and Namibia, SA-7s were deployed against the South African Air Force with limited success. The SAAF lost Atlas Impalas to Strelas on 24 January 1980 and 10 October 1980. Another Impala was hit by an SA-7 on 23 December 1983, but the pilot was able to fly the aircraft back to Ondangwa AB. UNITA also reportedly obtained 50 SA-7s that Israel had captured, via the CIA. The first one was fired at Cuban aircraft by a French mercenary on 13 March 1976, but the missile failed to hit the target. The individual missiles may have been in poor condition, as none scored a direct hit. Additionally, it is claimed that UNITA used SA-7s to shoot down two Transafrik International Lockheed L-100-30 Hercules flying UN charters, on 26 December 1998 and 2 January 1999, both near Huambo.

==== Sudan ====
Using an SA-7, the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army shot down a Sudan Airways Fokker F-27 Friendship 400M taking off from Malakal on 16 August 1986, killing all 60 on board. On 21 December 1989, an Aviation Sans Frontières Britten-Norman BN-2A-9 Islander (F-OGSM) was shot down by an SA-7 while taking off from Aweil Sudan, killing the four crew on board.

==== Western Sahara ====
The Polisario Front used SA-7s against the Royal Moroccan Air Force and Mauritanian Air Force during the Western Sahara War over the former Spanish colonies of the Spanish Sahara. The Mauritania Air Force lost a Britten-Norman Defender to a SA-7 fired by the Polisario on 29 December 1976. Between 1975 and 1991, the Royal Moroccan Air Force has lost several Northrop F-5A Freedom Fighters and Dassault Mirage F1s to SA-7s fired by the Polisario. In a case of mistaken identity, a Dornier 228 owned by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research was shot down over the Western Sahara near Dakhla on 24 February 1985. Two Dornier 228s named Polar 2 and Polar 3 were on a return flight to Germany following a South Pole expedition. After having taken off from Dakar, Senegal, en route to Arrecife, Canary Islands, flying 5 minutes behind Polar 2 and at a lower altitude of , Polar 3 was shot down by a SA-7 fired by the Polisario. The crew of three was killed. In another incident, on 8 December 1988, two Douglas DC-7CFs flying at from Dakar, Senegal to Agadir, Morocco for a locust control mission there, had SA-7s fired at them by the Polisario. One aircraft, N284, was hit and lost one of its engines and part of a wing. This led to the aircraft crashing, killing the crew of five. The other aircraft, N90804, also was hit and lost an engine along with suffering other damage, but it was able to land safely at Sidi Ifni Morocco.

==== Airliner attacks ====
During the Rhodesian Bush War, members of the military wing of the Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army brought down two Vickers Viscount civilian airliners near Kariba; the first in September 1978, the second in February 1979. There was great loss of life in both instances as the flights were returning from a well known tourist attraction.
* Vickers Viscount, Flight RH825, 3 September 1978 – downed by a Strela missile near Kariba Dam. After initial impact, the pilot was able to make an emergency landing in a nearby field but the aircraft broke up on impact. Eighteen of the fifty-six passengers in the tail section survived the crash. Ten of these survivors were shot dead at the crash-site by insurgents, who later looted the bodies and wreckage.
* Vickers Viscount, Flight RH827, 12 February 1979 – shot by down Strela missile near Kariba Dam; all 59 people on board were killed.

UNITA claimed that they used one to shoot down a TAAG Boeing 737-2M2 taking off from Lubango on 8 November 1983. A Lignes Aériennes Congolaises Boeing 727-30 taking off from Kindu was shot down by an SA-7 fired by rebel forces in 1998, killing all 41 on board. Two missiles were fired at a Boeing 757 during the 2002 Mombasa attacks in Kenya. Neither missile struck its target.

=== Latin America ===
==== Argentina ====
Strela-2M missiles were available to Argentinian troops in the Falkland Islands during the Falklands War. War Machine Encyclopedia shows no records of any launches, but several missiles were captured.

==== Nicaragua ====
The Strela-2 was used by both Sandinista government forces and US-backed &quot;Contra&quot; insurgents during the 1979–1990 civil war.

On 3 October 1983, at about 10:00 am, Sandinista soldier Fausto Palacios used a Strela to shoot down a Contra-operated Douglas DC-3 that had taken off from Catamacas airport in Honduras, carrying supplies, over the area of Los Cedros, in the Nueva Segovia Department. One crewman died in the crash and four were captured by government forces. The pilot, Major Roberto Amador Alvarez, as well as his co-pilot Capt. Hugo Reinaldo Aguilar were former members of the extinct National Guard of the former dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle.

On 27 August 1984, Sandinista soldier Fanor Medina Leyton shot down a Contra-operated Douglas C-47 Skytrain with a Strela. Sources differ over the attack and crash area: both a Russian source and Sandinista officials reported the Jinotega Department, while the Aviation Safety Network reports the Quilalí area in the Nueva Segovia department. All eight occupants were killed. The pilot, José Luis Gutiérrez Lugo, was reported as a former pilot for the Somoza family. Sandinista and Contra forces subsequently battled for the control of six packages dropped from the plane.

On 5 October 1986 a Corporate Air Services C-123 Provider (HPF821, previously N4410F and USAF 54-679, (c/n 20128)) conducting a covert drop of arms to Contra fighters in Nicaragua was shot down by Sandinista soldier José Fernando Canales Alemán, using an SA-7. CIA pilots William J. Cooper and Wallace &quot;Buzz&quot; Sawyer as well as radio operator Freddy Vilches were killed in the crash. Loadmaster Eugene Hasenfus parachuted to safety and was taken prisoner. He was later released in December 1986. The flight had departed Ilopango Airport, El Salvador loaded with 70 Soviet-made AK-47 rifles and 100,000 rounds of ammunition, rocket grenades and other supplies.

On 15 June 1987, a Contra-operated Beechcraft Baron 56TC (reg. N666PF, msn. TG-60) was hit by Sandinista anti-aircraft fire over the Nueva Segovia Department. The (formerly civilian) light utility aircraft, which was removed from the US registry two years before, and was reportedly modified to carry rockets for use in an air-to-ground light strike role, was downed after an attack that reportedly included dropping leaflets and, possibly, reconnaissance. The aircraft crashed inside Honduras, in an area known as &quot;Cerro El Tigre&quot; and its three occupants, all former military elements of the Somoza dictatorship, were injured and captured after the crash landing and were treated in Honduras. The pilot, Juan Gomez, a former colonel in Somoza&#x27;s National Guard was also reported to be the head of the Contra air force. A Russian source credits the Baron’s downing to an Strela-2 fired from Murra by Sandinista soldier Jose Manuel Rodriguez.

==== El Salvador ====
FMLN rebels acquired SA-7 missiles around 1989 and employed them extensively in the closing years of the Salvadoran Civil War, dramatically increasing the combat losses of Salvadoran Air Force aircraft. At least two O-2 Skymasters (on 26 September and 19 November 1990), one A-37 Dragonfly (on 23 November 1990), two Hughes 500 helicopters (2 February and 18 May 1990), and two UH-1Hs were lost to SA-7s. One of the UH-1Hs (on 2 January 1991) was crewed by US Army personnel, while the other was operated by the Honduran Air Force.

==== Colombia ====
In late December 2012, a video showing FARC rebels attempting to shoot down a Colombian Air Force Arpía helicopter with an SA-7 in the Cauca raised the alarm in the Colombian military, though the missile failed. During that same month, a Strela was captured by the Colombian military. It is believed that they might came from Cuba, Nicaragua or Peru; the only Latin American operators of the type.

Furthermore, the CIA&#x27;s motive to remove and destroy Chinese copies of the SA-7 (HN-5s) from Bolivia in 2005 was the fear of them reaching FARC rebels because, according to a US military magazine, “they used the HN-5 against Colombian-operated U.S-made helicopters”. The Ecuadorian Army captured an HN-5 allegedly destined for the FARC in the border province of Sucumbíos, near Colombia, in July 2013.

=== Europe ===
==== Bosnia ====
The Army of Republika Srpska, backed by the Armed Forces of Serbia and Montenegro, used Strela-2M and upgraded Strela-2M/A missiles against Bosnian, Croatian, and NATO forces. On 3 September 1992, an Italian Air Force G.222 transport was presumably shot down by an Strela-2M during a United Nations relief mission near Sarajevo. Serbian forces shot down a Croatian Air Force MiG-21 in September 1993 with a Strela-2M. On 17December 1994, a French Navy Dassault Étendard IVP was hit by a Strela-2M, but managed to return to its carrier.

During Operation Deliberate Force, NATO pilots were instructed to fly in medium altitudes to avoid Bosnian Serb MANPADS, such as the Strela-2 and the more modern Igla, although on 30 August 1995 a French Air Force Mirage 2000N was shot down by a Bosnian Serb MANPADS and its crew captured, the only aircraft lost during the campaign due hostile fire.

==== Northern Ireland ====
The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) acquired some missiles from Libya. One was reported to have been fired at a British Army Air Corps Lynx helicopter in July 1991 in South Armagh; however, it missed its target. To counter the new threat, the British helicopters flew in pairs below 15 meters (50 feet) or above 150 meters (500 feet).

==== Spain ====
In 2001, the Basque separatist group ETA tried on three occasions (29 April, 4 and 11 May) to use Strela 2 missiles to shoot down the Dassault Falcon 900 aircraft with the then-Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar on board. The attempts, which were made near the Fuenterrabía and Foronda airports, were unsuccessful as each time the missiles failed to launch. In 2004, several systems were captured by the Civil Guard. Some Strela 2 missiles were bought from the IRA in 1999, while Libya was tracked as the original source used by the IRA.

==== Ukraine ====
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Germany reversed its ban on weapon sales to provide Ukraine with military support. On 23 March 2022, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock confirmed the delivery of 500 Strela-2 missiles which were part of former East German arsenals.

<text>The pancreatic islets or islets of Langerhans are the regions of the pancreas that contain its endocrine (hormone-producing) cells, discovered in 1869 by German pathological anatomist Paul Langerhans. The pancreatic islets constitute 1–2% of the pancreas volume and receive 10–15% of its blood flow. The pancreatic islets are arranged in density routes throughout the human pancreas, and are important in the metabolism of glucose.

== Structure ==
There are about 1 million islets distributed throughout the pancreas of a healthy adult human. While islets vary in size, the average diameter is about 0.2 mm.:928 Each islet is separated from the surrounding pancreatic tissue by a thin, fibrous, connective tissue capsule which is continuous with the fibrous connective tissue that is interwoven throughout the rest of the pancreas.:928 

===Microanatomy===
Hormones produced in the pancreatic islets are secreted directly into the blood flow by (at least) five types of cells. In rat islets, endocrine cell types are distributed as follows:
* Alpha cells producing glucagon (20% of total islet cells)
* Beta cells producing insulin and amylin (≈70%)
* PP cells (gamma cells or F cells) producing pancreatic polypeptide (&lt;5%)
* Delta cells producing somatostatin (&lt;10%)
* Epsilon cells producing ghrelin (&lt;1%)

It has been recognized that the cytoarchitecture of pancreatic islets differs between species.
In particular, while rodent islets are characterized by a predominant proportion of insulin-producing beta cells in the core of the cluster and by scarce alpha, delta and PP cells in the periphery, human islets display alpha and beta cells in close relationship with each other throughout the cluster.

The proportion of beta cells in islets varies depending on the species, in humans it is about 40–50%. In addition to endocrine cells, there are stromal cells (fibroblasts), vascular cells (endothelial cells, pericytes), immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells,) and neural cells.

A large amount of blood flows through the islets, 5–6 mL/min per 1 g of islet. It is up to 15 times more than in exocrine tissue of the pancreas.

Islets can influence each other through paracrine and autocrine communication, and beta cells are coupled electrically to six to seven other beta cells, but not to other cell types. Pancreatic islets are characterized by rich innervation and vascularization, although there are notable differences between rodent and human islets. Research indicates that the vascular density in human islets is about five times lower than in rodent islets. The vascular network within the islets resembles a glomeruli-like structure, consisting of highly fenestrated endothelial cells positioned closely to each endocrine cell. Consequently, the oxygen tension within pancreatic islets is significantly higher than that in the surrounding exocrine tissue.
== Function ==
The paracrine feedback system of the pancreatic islets has the following structure:
* Glucose/Insulin: activates beta cells and inhibits alpha cells.
* Glycogen/Glucagon: activates alpha cells which activates beta cells and delta cells.
* Somatostatin: inhibits alpha cells and beta cells. Also inhibits the secretion of pancreatic polypeptide.

A large number of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate the secretion of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin from pancreatic islets, and some of these GPCRs are the targets of drugs used to treat type-2 diabetes (ref GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPPIV inhibitors).
===Electrical activity===
Electrical activity of pancreatic islets has been studied using patch clamp techniques. It has turned out that the behavior of cells in intact islets differs significantly from the behavior of dispersed cells.

==Clinical significance==

===Diabetes===
The beta cells of the pancreatic islets secrete insulin, and so play a significant role in diabetes. It is thought that they are destroyed by immune assaults.

Because the beta cells in the pancreatic islets are selectively destroyed by an autoimmune process in type 1 diabetes, clinicians and researchers are actively pursuing islet transplantation as a means of restoring physiological beta cell function, which would offer an alternative to a complete pancreas transplant or artificial pancreas. Islet transplantation emerged as a viable option for the treatment of insulin requiring diabetes in the early 1970s with steady progress over the following three decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.cellr4.org/article/128&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical trials have shown that insulin independence and improved metabolic control can be reproducibly obtained after transplantation of cadaveric donor islets into patients with unstable type 1 diabetes. Alternatively, daily insulin injections are an effective treatment for type 1 diabetes patients who are not candidates for islet transplantation. 

People with high body mass index (BMI) are unsuitable pancreatic donors due to greater technical complications during transplantation. However, it is possible to isolate a larger number of islets because of their larger pancreas, and therefore they are more suitable donors of islets.

Islet transplantation only involves the transfer of tissue consisting of beta cells that are necessary as a treatment of this disease. It thus represents an advantage over whole pancreas transplantation, which is more technically demanding and poses a risk of, for example, pancreatitis leading to organ loss. Another advantage is that patients do not require general anesthesia.

Islet transplantation for type 1 diabetes () requires potent immunosuppression to prevent host rejection of donor islets.

The islets are transplanted into a portal vein, which is then implanted in the liver. There is a risk of portal venous branch thrombosis and the low value of islet survival a few minutes after transplantation, because the vascular density at this site is after the surgery several months lower than in endogenous islets. Thus, neovascularization is key to islet survival, that is supported, for example, by VEGF produced by islets and vascular endothelial cells. However, intraportal transplantation has some other shortcomings, and so other alternative sites that would provide better microenvironment for islets implantation are being examined. Islet transplant research also focuses on islet encapsulation, CNI-free (calcineurin-inhibitor) immunosuppression, biomarkers of islet damage or islet donor shortage.

An alternative source of beta cells, such insulin-producing cells derived from adult stem cells or progenitor cells would contribute to overcoming the shortage of donor organs for transplantation. The field of regenerative medicine is rapidly evolving and offers great hope for the nearest future. However, type 1 diabetes is the result of the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in the pancreas. Therefore, an effective cure will require a sequential, integrated approach that combines adequate and safe immune interventions with beta cell regenerative approaches. It has also been demonstrated that alpha cells can spontaneously switch fate and transdifferentiate into beta cells in both healthy and diabetic human and mouse pancreatic islets, a possible future source for beta cell regeneration. In fact, it has been found that islet morphology and endocrine differentiation are directly related. Endocrine progenitor cells differentiate by migrating in cohesion and forming bud-like islet precursors, or &quot;peninsulas&quot;, in which alpha cells constitute the peninsular outer layer and beta cells form later beneath them. Cryopreservation has shown promise to improve the supply chain of pancreatic islets for better transplantation outcomes.

== Research ==
Cannabinoid receptors are found widely expressed in islets of Langerhans, and several studies have investigated specific distribution and mechanisms of CB1 versus CB2 receptors in relation to pancreatic endocrine functions, where they play an important homeostatic role, as endocannabinoids modulate pancreatic β-cells function, proliferation, and survival, as well as insulin production, secretion, and resistance.

<text>Soyuz 12 (, &quot;Union 12&quot;) was a September, 1973, crewed test flight by the Soviet Union of the newly redesigned Soyuz 7K-T spacecraft that was intended to provide greater crew safety in the wake of the Soyuz 11 tragedy. The flight marked the return of the Soviets to crewed space operations after the 1971 accident. The crew capacity of the capsule had been decreased from three to two cosmonauts to allow for pressure suits to be worn during launch, re-entry and docking. It was the first time pressure suits were used for reentry since the Voskhod 2 flight.

Cosmonauts Vasily Lazarev and Oleg Grigoryevich Makarov spent two days in space testing the new craft.

== Mission highlights ==
As the first crewed test of the new version of the Soyuz ferry craft, Soyuz 12 was to have flown to a Salyut station. But the failures of Salyut 2 (4 April 1973) and Cosmos 557 (11 May 1973) in the months previous meant there was no station for the craft to dock to. The service module had no solar panels, carrying batteries for power instead, which limited the flight to about two days, enough time for a journey to and from a space station.

Cosmonauts Lazarev and Makarov wore pressure suits for launch and landing, and would have worn them for a station docking, all changes brought about by the Soyuz 11 tragedy. The bulk of the suits and their environmental control systems limited the crew size to two.

After the successful 27 September 1973 launch, the craft was maneuvered to a 326 x 344 km orbit on the second day in space, which later proved to be the standard orbit for the Salyut 4 space station. A multispectral camera in the orbital module was used in coordination with aircraft to photograph the Earth. It was reported that the intention of the camera was to survey crop and forest conditions The cosmonauts also utilised the Molniya 1 satellite to communicate with ground stations when out of range. The crew landed safely on 29 September 1973 and the mission was called &quot;flawless&quot;. A large object was jettisoned when the craft was preparing for retrofire. The object remained in orbit for 116 days.

<text>The Convair 880 is a retired American narrow-body jet airliner produced by the Convair division of General Dynamics. It was designed to compete with the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 by being smaller but faster, a niche that failed to create demand. When it was first introduced, some in aviation circles claimed that at , it was the fastest jet transport in the world. Only 65 Convair 880s were produced over the lifetime of the production run from 1959 to 1962, and General Dynamics eventually withdrew from the airliner market after considering the 880 project a failure. The Convair 990 Coronado was a stretched and faster variant of the 880.

==Development==
Convair began development of a medium-range commercial jet in April 1956, to compete with announced products from Boeing and Douglas. Initially the design was called the Skylark, but the name was later changed to the Golden Arrow, then Convair 600 and then finally the 880, both numbers referring to its top speed of 600 mph (970 km/h) or 880 ft/s (268 m/s). It was powered by General Electric CJ-805-3 turbojets, a civilian version of the J79 which powered the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom, and Convair B-58 Hustler.

The first example of the Model 22 FAA Type Certificate, initial production version (no prototype was built) made its maiden flight on 27 January 1959. After production started, the Federal Aviation Administration mandated additional instrumentation, which Convair added by placing a &quot;raceway&quot; hump on the top of the fuselage, rather than ripping apart the interiors over the wing area. The final assembly of the 880 and 990 took place at the Convair facilities in San Diego, California.

==Design==

The airliner never became widely used, and the production line shut down after only three years. The 880&#x27;s five-abreast seating made it unattractive to airlines, while Boeing was able to outcompete it with the Boeing 720, which could be sold at a significantly lower price, as it was a minimal modification of the existing 707. In addition, the General Electric engines had a higher specific fuel consumption than the Boeing&#x27;s Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3Cs.

General Dynamics lost around $185 million over the lifetime of the project, although some sources estimate much higher losses. The aircraft were involved in 17 accidents and five hijackings.

A modified version of the basic 880 was the &quot;-M&quot; version, which incorporated four leading-edge slats per wing, Krueger leading-edge flaps between the fuselage and inboard engines, power-boosted rudder, added engine thrust, increased fuel capacity, stronger landing gear, greater adjustment to seating pitch, and a simpler overhead compartment arrangement.

A more major modification to the 880 became the Convair 990, produced in parallel with the 880-M between 1961 and 1963. Swissair named theirs Coronado, after an island off the San Diego coast and where the first 990 landed.

==Operational history==
The design entered service with Delta Air Lines in May 1960, slightly modified as the 880-22M, having newer-version 805-3B engines. The 880s were flown by Cathay Pacific, Delta, Japan Airlines, Northeast Airlines, Swissair, TWA, and VIASA.

As they left commercial service, many 880s were bought by American Jet Industries for various uses. One example was converted to freighter use in 1974, and flew until 1982 with various companies. Another was used to train FAA flight examiners until it was destroyed by a minor explosion in the cargo hold in 1995. Most of the remaining examples were scrapped by 2000.

The United States Navy acquired one 880-M in 1980, modifying it as an in-flight tanker. It had been purchased new from Convair by the FAA, and used for 18 years. Unofficially designated UC-880, it was assigned to the Naval Air Test Center at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, and employed in Tomahawk cruise missile testing and aircraft refueling procedures. The UC-880 was damaged in a cargo-hold explosive decompression test at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, in 1995. The aircraft was judged to still have been controllable using backup systems had the decompression occurred in flight.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On May 23, 1960, Delta Air Lines Flight 1903, a CV-880-22-1 (N8804E), crashed on takeoff at Atlanta Municipal Airport (now Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport), resulting in the loss of all four crew members. This flight was to be a training sortie for two Delta captains who were being type-rated on the 880. At rotation, the aircraft pitched nose up, rolled left, and then back more steeply to the right, at which time it struck the ground, broke apart, and was consumed by a fire.
* On August 26, 1966, a Japan Air Lines CV-880-22M-3 (JA8030) crashed on takeoff from Haneda Airport during a training flight, killing all five crew members. When the nose lifted up, the aircraft yawed to the left, for reasons unknown. The number one engine struck the runway and the aircraft left the runway and the nose went back down. All four engines separated, as well as the nose and left main gear, and the aircraft caught fire. The aircraft was leased from Japan Domestic Airlines.
* On November 5, 1967, Cathay Pacific Flight 033, a CV-880-22M-3 (VR-HFX) overran the runway on takeoff from Kai Tak Airport following a loss of control after the right nosewheel blew, killing 1 of 127 on board.
* On November 20, 1967, TWA Flight 128 crashed on approach to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Seventy people were killed and twelve survived.
* On June 24, 1969, Japan Air Lines Flight 90, a CV-880-22M-3 (JA8028, &quot;Kikyo&quot;), crashed on takeoff from Grant County Airport, Washington, killing three of the five crew members. The flight was to simulate a takeoff with one engine out. Power was reduced to the number four engine during takeoff, but the aircraft continued to yaw to the right until the number four engine struck the runway. The aircraft slid off the runway and caught fire.
* On June 15, 1972, a bomb exploded on board Cathay Pacific Flight 700Z over Pleiku, South Vietnam, killing all 81 passengers and crew on board.
* On December 20, 1972, North Central Airlines Flight 575, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31, collided during its takeoff roll with Delta Air Lines Flight 954, a Convair 880 (N8807E), as the Convair 880 taxied across the runway at O&#x27;Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois. Only two people on the Convair 880 were injured, but 10 people died and 15 were injured on board the DC-9.
* On August 20, 1977, a Monarch Aviation CV-880-22-2 (N8817E) struck trees and crashed shortly after takeoff from Juan Santamaria International Airport, Costa Rica, due to overloading, killing the three crew.
* On November 3, 1980, a Latin Carga CV-880-22-2 (YV-145C) crashed on takeoff from Simon Bolivar International Airport, Caracas, Venezuela, during a crew training flight, killing the four crew.
* On May 11, 1983, a Groth Air CV-880-22-2 (N880SR) burned out at Juarez International Airport, Mexico City.
* In October 1986, an FAA CV-880-22M-3 (N5863) was intentionally destroyed in a test with anti-misting kerosene fuel additive at Mojave, California.

* 35 – Complete aircraft in storage at Scroggins Aviation in Mojave, California.
* 38 – &quot;Lisa Marie&quot; – On display at Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee: Formerly N8809E with Delta, Elvis Presley purchased the aircraft in 1975 and named it after his daughter. In January 2015, it was put up for sale and eventually bought back by Elvis Presley Enterprises and displayed as part of the Presley Museum collection.
* 58 – Converted into a lodge in East London, South Africa: This airframe was converted into a business jet in the 1970s (registration N88CH). It was purchased by the Ciskei government in 1987 intended for use by president Lennox Sebe, but remained at Bhisho Airport for several years due to a lack of funds to make it airworthy. In 1992, it was bought by Billy Nel (now Eastern Cape Provincial Finance MEC), who had it transported to his private residence north of East London, South Africa. The 1970s, VIP interior with couches, beds and a bar remain intact and it is used for private functions. One of the engines was donated to the Stutterheim Engine Museum.

<doc id="199464" wikidata="Q931500" url="?curid=199464" title="List of astronauts by name">
<text>This is an alphabetical list of [[astronaut]]s, people selected to train for a human spaceflight program to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a spacecraft.

For a list of everyone who has flown in space, see List of space travelers by name.

More than 600 people have been trained as astronauts. Until recently, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, either by the military or by civilian space agencies. However, with the advent of suborbital flight starting with privately funded SpaceShipOne in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the commercial astronaut.

While the term astronaut is sometimes applied to anyone who trains for travel into space—including scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists—this article lists only professional astronauts, those who have been selected to train professionally. This includes national space programs, industry and commercial space programs which train and/or hire their own professional astronauts.

The flags indicate the astronaut&#x27;s primary citizenship during his or her time as an astronaut. The symbol identifies female astronauts. The symbol △ indicates astronauts who have left low Earth orbit. The symbol ▲ indicates astronauts who have walked on the Moon. The symbol † indicates astronauts who have died in incidents related to a space program.

<text>GeoPort is a serial data system used on some models of the Apple Macintosh that could be externally clocked to run at a 2 megabit per second data rate. GeoPort slightly modified the existing Mac serial port pins to allow the computer&#x27;s internal DSP hardware or software to send data that, when passed to a digital-to-analog converter, emulated various devices such as modems and fax machines. GeoPort could be found on late-model 68K-based machines (the AV series) as well as many pre-USB Power Macintosh models and PiPPiN. Some later Macintosh models also included an internal GeoPort via an internal connector on the Communications Slot. Apple GeoPort technology is now obsolete, and modem support is typically offered through USB.

Early during the development of the Apple Macintosh, Apple engineers decided to use the Zilog 8530 &quot;Serial Communications Controller&quot; (SCC) for most input/output tasks. The SCC was relatively advanced compared to the more common UARTs of the era, offering a number of high-speed modes and built-in software for error checking and similar duties. The speed of the system was based on an external clock signal sent to it by the host platform, normally up to about 1 Mbit/s, which could be &quot;divided down&quot; to run at slower speeds as low as 300 bit/s. The SCC had two channels, which could be run at different speeds, and even different voltages, to allow communications with a wide variety of devices and interfaces.

Initially the engineers had envisioned using the SCC to support a packet-based protocol known as &quot;AppleBus&quot;. AppleBus would allow peripheral devices to be plugged into a daisy-chain configuration in a manner surprisingly similar to the modern Universal Serial Bus. However, as development continued, Apple&#x27;s networking project, AppleNet, was being canceled due to high costs and a rapidly changing marketplace. Team members working on AppleBus quickly shifted gears, producing the LocalTalk system running on the SCC ports rather than AppleNet&#x27;s plug-in expansion card.

LocalTalk relied on clocking from the CPU that was divided down to produce an output at roughly 230.4 kbit/s. Nodes on the network remained in sync using clock recovery. This allowed the entire system to be run over a simple three-wire connection, or two-wires in the case of PhoneNet. As the ports also include the clock pins, it was possible to override the internal clock signal and run the system at much higher speeds, as was the case for Dayna and Centram products that ran between 750 and 850 kbit/s.

However, as the SCC had only three bytes of buffer space, it was critical that the ports be read as quickly as possible to prevent a buffer overflow and loss of data. This was not an issue for networking protocols, where lost packets are assumed and dealt with in the network stack, but represented a serious problem for RS-232 data which had no internal form of flow control in the data stream. As a result, performance on a Mac Plus was generally limited to about 9600 bit/s in RS-232 mode, and could only reliably maintain half of that if LocalTalk was active at the same time.

Apple was aware of these problems, and starting with the Macintosh IIfx they attempted to address them by including two dedicated &quot;Input/Output Processors&quot; (IOP), customized MOS 6502s running at 10 MHz. The IOPs offloaded the low-level driver code from the host CPU, running the floppy disks and serial ports, only interrupting the CPU when there was data to transfer. The IIfx also introduced a DMA mode for the SCSI-bus, but this was not available for use by the IOPs. The IOPs also appeared on the Quadra 900 and Quadra 950.

===AV and GeoPort===
After the early Quadra machines, Apple started a short-lived experiment including AT&amp;T 3210 digital signal processors (DSP) in the &quot;AV&quot; series machines (the 840AV and 660AV). The DSP was primarily intended to offer audio and video digitization support, accessed though the custom 60-pin &quot;Digital Audio/Video&quot; (DAV) port on the rear of the machines.

DSPs were also commonly used at that time as the basic building block of high-speed modems. Using the relatively advanced 3210 would offer higher performance than existing modems, which used lower-end DSPs, and much better performance than softmodems using the host CPU. All that would be needed was a suitable external analog-to-digital converter, or &quot;line adapter&quot; as it was referred to in Apple terminology.

However, the 60-pin AV connector was not suitable for such connections, and users expected to plug &quot;modems&quot; into the modem port. Although the existing serial ports could be adapted to run in &quot;AV mode&quot; in the same fashion that the older versions could run in RS-232 or networking mode, the line adaptor required more power that the port could supply. Apple solved this problem by adding a 9th pin to the existing 8-pin Mini-DIN connector. The result was GeoPort.

In GeoPort mode the SCC was placed in a high-speed mode using external clocking, similar to the earlier high-performance LocalTalk replacements. The DSP then generated signals and sent them over the serial bus to the adapter, which converted them to analog and amplified them to telephone levels. In GeoPort mode, speeds up to 2 Mbit/s were supported.

One widely known device to make use of the GeoPort was Apple&#x27;s own &quot;GeoPort Telecom Adapter&quot;. Initially released as the &quot;pod&quot; with the AV Macs in 1993, it later became its own separate product in early 1995 when it was released for PowerPC-based Macintosh machines that did not include AV-related hardware out of the box. Apple later incorporated GeoPort lines into an edge connector on the motherboard of certain Mac models known as the Communication Slot, preserving them on the later Communication Slot II. Three adaptors would eventually be sold: the original pod, the internal version, and an updated pod known as the GeoPort Telecom Adapter II. All used standard RJ-11 phone line connectors.

Initially the adapter driver software could support speeds up to 9600 bit/s, but later upgrades introduced full V.34 compliance, running at up to 33.6 kbit/s. In practice the GeoPort Adaptors tied up huge amounts of CPU time, and led to performance problems throughout the system. They were also notorious for poor quality connections, dropped calls and poor support from existing software; many pundits recommended not using them.

SAGEM also introduced an ISDN adaptor for GeoPort, the &quot;Planet-ISDN Geoport Adapter&quot;, or SPIGA, which they now sell in a USB version. Global Village also produced a variant of its compact Teleport Modems for Apple Performas and third-party Mac computers that used the 9th pin to supply power, but these were true hardware modems, not GeoPort devices.

Apple&#x27;s first two QuickTake digital cameras (100 and 150) also supported the GeoPort protocol for transfer between the camera and GeoPort-equipped Macintosh computers.

===As a &quot;standard&quot;===
During the evolution of GeoPort, the telecommunications market was undergoing major changes with the introduction of newer all-digital PBX systems. A number of these companies offered some sort of computer telephony integration, although they were all based on their own standards, typically connected to the computers via a serial port at relatively low speeds. Although these signals could have been routed using existing networking standards like Ethernet, most companies used custom systems, like Switch56.

Apple started an effort to promote GeoPort as a standardized computer interface to PBX systems. They envisioned different GeoPort adapters for different back-end systems; a Switch56 interface could be used with Northern Telecom systems, while another would be used to connect to the InteCom switches that Apple used. Apple claimed that the &quot;same GeoPort phone pod will be able to support TAPI applications on a Windows PC and Telephone Manager applications on a Mac.&quot;

To connect those systems to the Macintosh, in particular, Apple created the Macintosh Telephony Architecture (MTA) and promoted it as a standardized telephony application program interface. The MTA consisted primarily of three parts, the &quot;Telephone Manager&quot; which handled call-control, the &quot;Telephone Tool&quot; that mapped Telephone Manager commands onto specific hardware, and finally a set of telephony-related Apple Events that would allow simple operation from any scripting-aware Macintosh program. MTA was essentially Apple&#x27;s analog of Microsoft&#x27;s TAPI or Novell&#x27;s TSAPI.

To promote the system, in late 1994 Apple organized the Versit alliance along with AT&amp;T, IBM and Siemens to attempt to standardize the commands that the PBX systems responded to. Novell announced that they would adapt TSAPI to work on top of the Versit standards. All of these efforts were hampered by a lack of standardization among PBX vendors, and their lack of real support for GeoPort adapters.

After two years of effort with little to show for it, Apple eventually gave up on Versit, and telephony in general. The main problem was that the various PBX companies relied on vendor lock-in to keep their existing customers coming back to them for newer products, so the very concept of a standardized system was seen as a problem rather than a solution. Lip-service was paid to the concept in order to have an answer to those predicting such systems would become common. Additionally there was no support for high-speed serial on the basic PC, so users would have to buy an add-on card if they were going to use GeoPort, at which point it made just as much sense to buy a custom adaptor on a different card.

The GeoPort was dropped, along with SCSI and ADB, when Apple introduced the iMac in 1998; early demonstration models had a software modem based on the GeoPort Telecom Adapter&#x27;s technology, but this was replaced with a hardware 56K modem by the time the iMac shipped.

<text>The BT tank (, lit. &quot;fast moving tank&quot; or &quot;high-speed tank&quot;) was one of a series of Soviet light tanks produced in large numbers between 1932 and 1941. They were lightly armoured, but reasonably well-armed for their time, and had the best mobility of all contemporary tanks. The BT tanks were known by the nickname &quot;Betka&quot; from the acronym, or by its diminutive &quot;Betushka&quot;. The successor of the BT tanks was the famous T-34 medium tank, introduced in 1940, which would replace all of the Soviet fast tanks, infantry tanks, and light tanks in service.

== Design ==
The BT tanks were &quot;convertible tanks&quot;. This was a feature that was designed by J. Walter Christie to reduce wear of the unreliable tank tracks of the 1930s. In about thirty minutes, the crew could remove the tracks and engage a chain drive to the rearmost road wheel on each side, allowing the tank to travel at very high speeds on roads. In wheeled mode, the tank was steered by pivoting the front road wheels. According to historical researches, this feature may have been required by Stalin for planned European warfare within a strategy similar to blitzkrieg. However, Soviet tank forces soon found the convertible option of little practical use; in a country with few paved roads, it consumed space and added needless complexity and weight. The feature was dropped from later Soviet designs.

Christie, a race car mechanic and driver from New Jersey had failed to convince the U.S. Army Ordnance Bureau to adopt his Christie tank design. In 1930, Soviet agents at Amtorg, ostensibly a Soviet trade organization, used their New York political contacts to persuade U.S. military and civilian officials to provide plans and specifications of the Christie tank to the Soviet Union. At least two of Christie&#x27;s M1931 tanks (without turrets) were later purchased in the United States and sent to the Soviet Union under false documentation, in which they were described as &quot;agricultural tractors&quot;. Both tanks were delivered to the Kharkov Komintern Locomotive Plant (KhPZ). The original Christie tanks were designated &quot;fast tanks&quot; by the Soviets, abbreviated to BT (later referred to as BT-1). Based both on them and on other plans obtained earlier, three unarmed BT-2 prototypes were completed in October 1931 and mass production began in 1932. Most BT-2s were equipped with a 37 mm gun and a machine gun, but a shortage of 37 mm guns led to some early examples being fitted with three machine guns. The sloping front hull (glacis plate) armor design of the Christie M1931 prototype was retained in later Soviet tank hull designs, later adopted for side armor as well. The BT-5 and later models were equipped with 45 mm guns.

== Variants ==


===Soviet Union===
====BT-1 to BT-4====
* BT-1: Christie prototype with no turret
* BT-2 Model 1932: M-5-400 engine (copy of U.S. Liberty L-12 engine); three turret versions were produced: with single 37 mm gun (60); 37 mm gun and one DT machine gun (148); twin DP machine guns in place of gun and a single DT machine gun (412). In late 1932, modified to BT-3 but produced under the same designation.
**BT-2-IS: prototype with three-axle drive, rejected due to complexity.
* BT-3: same as BT-2, produced according to metric system (instead of the Imperial system as used for the BT-2). In official documentation referred to as &quot;BT-2&quot;.
* BT-4: was a design with welded hull and minor changes in the suspension. Three prototypes produced (with partially riveted hulls). A fake &quot;variant&quot; with two machine gun turrets of early T-26 can be found captioned as BT-4, but it has never existed and images are edited.
====BT-5====
* BT-5: larger cylindrical turret, 45 mm 20-K gun, coaxial DT machine gun. Earlier tanks used simpler fully cylindrical bolted turrets with rear bustle welded on.
* BT-5PKh: snorkelling variant (prototypes only)
* BT-5A: artillery support version with 76.2 mm howitzer (prototypes only)
* RBT-5: rocket launcher artillery version, equipped with two 420 mm tank torpedoes (prototypes only)
* BT-5 flamethrower tank (prototypes only)
* BT-5-IS: prototype with three-axle drive, rejected due to complexity. In 1938 the same prototype was upgraded with sloped side plates, leading to development of BT-SV-2.
* PT-1A: amphibious variant with new hull (prototypes only)
* TT-BT-5: teletank, remote-radio-controlled tank (prototypes only)
*Tsyganov&#x27;s BT: a &quot;very fast&quot; version of BT-5 by N. F. Tsyganov, which had a set of 30 wheels connected by a chain. It was supposed to reach up to 105 km/h, but was rejected due to complexity and only one mock-up was built
* BT-6: BT-5 with fully welded hull, predecessor of BT-7 (prototype)
====BT-7====
* BT-7 Model 1935: welded hull, redesigned hull front, new Mikulin M-17T engine (licensed copy of a BMW engine), enclosed muffler, new short-pitch tracks
* BT-7 Model 1937: new turret with sloping armour
* BT-7TU: command version, with whip antenna instead of earlier frame antenna
* BT-7A: artillery support version with a 76.2 mm howitzer in larger turret similar to one of T-28. 155 were intended to be made, but of them 21 were finished with normal BT-7 turrets and one lacked a cannon, this particular tank was later used for testing 76.2 mm L-11 and F-32 cannons.
* OP-7: flame-thrower version with external fuel panniers (prototype only)
* TT-BT-7: teletank, remote-radio-controlled tank (prototype only)
* BT-SV-2 &quot;Cherepakha&quot; (&quot;turtle&quot;): another prototype, this took armour sloping to an extreme
* BT-7M (1938, prototypes designated A-8; sometimes referred to as BT-8): new V-2 diesel engine replacing earlier gasoline engines.
====A-20/A-32====
* &#x27; (also known as &#x27;): prototype for a new BT tank, with 20 mm extremely sloped armour inspired by BT-SV-2 prototype, 45 mm 20-K gun, model V-2 diesel engine. Lost out in trials to the tracked-only A-32. The only built prototype is known to have participated in the Battle of Moscow. In 1941, as the Germans neared Moscow, the situation was so desperate that everything battle-worthy was put into service by the Soviets. The A-20 prototype, which at that time was at Kubinka army proving ground near Moscow for evaluation trials, was immediately put into service together with other prototypes of tanks present here, which were organized into a separate company led by Captain Semenov. Later on, the tank was included in the 22nd Tank Brigade organic, together with its predecessors and successors, BT-7 and T-34 tanks. On 1 December 1941, during fighting, the tank was seriously damaged and sent to the rear for repairs. Three days later, it re-entered service with the 22nd Tank Brigade until mid-December, when the tank was again damaged and evacuated to the rear. After these events, its fate is unknown.
*&#x27; (&#x27;): initially known as the A-20G (G - tracked) and then renamed to A-32, it was the competitor to the A-20. The wheels-and-tracks system was removed for the first time from the BT tanks series, making the tank design and production easier, more reliable and, especially, lighter; in fact, armor was increased to 30 mm, hull was enlarged, 5th road wheel was fitted in for better ground-pressure distribution and the 45 mm 20-K gun was replaced by the 76.2 mm L-10 gun, but the weight increased by only 1 ton (from 18 to 19 tons, respectively for the A-20 and A-32). Trials in 1939 showed that the tank armor could be upgraded and thus a request for increase to 45 mm was made. A second prototype was specially created for the purpose, this time equipped with turret and 45 mm armament from the A-20 and with additional weights placed on special brackets welded on the hull and turret to simulate mass of the up-armored tank. After satisfactory tests, other requests were made, for example to improve the visibility from inside the tank and to adopt the newer F-32 gun (later the L-11 and F-34 were adopted on prototypes and production models instead), which finally lead to the A-34, serial produced as the famous T-34.

===Foreign variants===
* BT-42: Finnish assault gun; captured BT-7s were equipped with British QF 4.5-inch howitzers. The co-axial DT gun was removed and turret re-designed to accommodate the new gun. Only 18 were made.
* BT-43: Finnish armoured personnel carrier; captured BT-7 equipped with troop accommodation. Only one prototype was made.

== Specifications ==
== Combat history ==

BT tanks saw service in the Second Sino-Japanese War, Spanish Civil War, Battles of Khalkhin Gol (also known as the Nomohan Incident), the Winter War in Finland, and in World War II.

===Spanish Civil War===
In the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), a regiment of 50 BT-5&#x27;s fought on the Republican side. They were manned by the members International Brigades trained in USSR and by some Soviet tankists. Their first combat on 13 October 1937 during the Zaragoza Offensive was disastrous: 13 tanks were lost due to bad tactics. Later, 12 more were lost from December 1937 to February 1938 during the Battle of Teruel. A few captured BT-5s were also used by the Nationalist side.

===Chinese service===
The Chinese Nationalist Army had four BT-5s which fought against the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945).

===Battles of Khalkin Gol===

During the Battles of Khalkhin Gol (also known as the Nomonhan Incident), which lasted from May to September in 1939, BT tanks were easily attacked by Japanese &quot;close quarter&quot; teams (tank killer squads) which were – in lieu of anti-tank weapons – armed with petrol (gasoline) bottles (later called &quot;Molotov cocktails&quot;). The BT-5s and BT-7s, operating in temperatures greater than on the Mongolian plains, easily caught fire when a Molotov cocktail ignited their gasoline engines. General Georgy Zhukov made it one of his &quot;points&quot; when briefing Joseph Stalin, that his &quot;...BT tanks were a bit fireprone...&quot; Conversely, many Japanese tank crews held the Soviet 45mm gun of the BT-5 and BT-7 in high esteem, noting, &quot;...no sooner did they see the flash from a Russian gun, than they&#x27;d notice a hole in their tank, adding that the Soviet gunners were accurate too!&quot;

After the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, the Soviet military broke into two camps; one side was represented by Spanish Civil War veterans General Pavel Rychagov of the Soviet Air Force, Soviet armour expert General Dimitry Pavlov, and Stalin&#x27;s favorite, Marshal Grigory Kulik, Chief of Artillery Administration. The other side consisted of the Khalkhin Gol veterans led by Generals Zhukov and Grigory Kravchenko of the Soviet Air Force. The lessons of Russia&#x27;s &quot;first real war on a massive scale using tanks, artillery, and airplanes&quot; at Khalkhin Gol went unheeded.

===Winter War===

During the Winter War against Finland in 1939–1940, BT-2, BT-5 and BT-7 tanks had less success against Finnish Army forces than they had against the Japanese at Khalkin Gol.

===World War II===

During the Second World War in Europe, BT-5 and BT-7 tanks were used in the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland. The Red Army planned to replace the BT tank series with the T-34 and had just begun doing so when Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941. BT-series tanks took part in large numbers in the battles that followed during 1941, during which thousands were abandoned or destroyed. A few remained in use in 1942, but rarely saw combat against German forces after that time.

During the final weeks of World War II, a significant number of BT-7 tanks took part in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945, seeing combat against Japanese occupation forces in Northeast China. This was the last combat action for the BT tanks.

== Technical legacy ==
The BT tank series was numerous, forming the cavalry tank arm of the Red Army in the 1930s and had much better mobility than other contemporary tank designs. For these reasons, there were many experiments and derivatives of the design, mostly conducted at the KhPZ factory in Kharkov.

The most important legacy of the BT tank was the T-34 medium tank. In 1937, a new design team was formed at the KhPZ to create the next generation of BT tanks. Initially, the chief designer was Mikhail Koshkin and after his death, Morozov. The team built two prototypes. The light one was called the &quot;A-20&quot;. The more heavily armed and armoured BT derivative, the &quot;A-32&quot;, was a &quot;universal tank&quot; to replace all the T-26 infantry tanks, BT cavalry tanks and T-28 medium tanks. Such a plan was controversial, but concerns about tank performance under the threat of the German blitzkrieg led to the approval for production of a still more heavily armoured version, the T-34 medium tank.

Along the way, an important technical development was the &quot;BT-IS&quot; and &quot;BT-SW-2&quot; testbed vehicles, concentrating on sloped armour. This proof-of-concept led directly to the armour layout of the T-34. BT tank chassis were also used as the basis for engineering support vehicles and mobility testing vehicles. A bridgelayer variant had a T-38 turret and launched a bridge across small gaps. Standard tanks were fitted as fascine carriers. The RBT-5 hosted a pair of large artillery rocket launchers, one on each side of the turret. Several designs for extremely wide tracks, including, oddly, wooden &#x27;snowshoes&#x27; were tried on BT tanks.

The &quot;KBT-7&quot; was a thoroughly modern armoured command vehicle that was in the prototype stage when World War II broke out. The design was not pursued during the war.

In the Kiev manoeuvres of 1936, foreign military observers were shown hundreds of BT tanks roll by a reviewing stand. In the audience were British Army representatives, who returned home to advocate for use of Christie suspension on British cruiser tanks, which they incorporated from the Cruiser Mk III onwards. The pointed shape of the hull front armor on the BT tank also influenced the design of the British Matilda tank.

<text>The BT-5 (&quot;Bystrohodnyi tank&quot; or &quot;Fast Tank type 5&quot;) was the second tank in the Soviet BT series of tanks. The BT-5 improved on the previous BT-2, such as a new turret fitted with a 45 mm anti-tank gun that was also used on the T-26 and the BT-5&#x27;s younger brother, the BT-7. The BT-5 would enter service in 1933, with the Red Army first seeing action with the Second Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War in 1937 until the end of World War II, with between 1884 and 2108 units being produced with production of the tank beginning in March 1933 with production ending in 1935.

== Design ==
The BT-5 had no armor improvements over the BT-2, with its thickest armor being 13 mm at its thickest and the thinnest being 6 mm thick. The suspension was a Christie suspension, which could have the tracks taken off to have road-wheels to use on the road. To turn the tank without the tracks, the driver had a steering wheel that turned the first wheel on each side. It took about a half hour to take off the tracks. The origins of the Christie suspension came from American racecar designer J. Walter Christie. When he failed to get the United States Army interested, he sold the design to the USSR. Due to American sanctions on the USSR, Christie sold the design as tractors. The armaments of the BT-5 were the 45 mm anti-tank gun M1932 (19-K) cannon and one coaxial 7.65 mm DP machine gun with 115 rounds of ammunition for the main cannon. The BT-5 had a crew of three: a commander/gunner, a loader, and a driver. Both the commander/gunner and loader sat in the turret, and the driver sat in the front of the hull. The turret was a cylinder shape and some tanks had radio antennas around the turret. The ammunition was stored in the turret and under the commander/gunner, and loader. The BT-5 had a newly developed M-5 engine as its source of power. The fuel tank could hold 360 liters of fuel, and the BT-5 had an operational range of 200 kilometers. The BT-5 had a maximum speed of 72 kilometers per hour, or 45 miles per hour on flat roads. The BT-5 had a 400-horsepower M-5 engine and a power-weight ratio of 35 horsepower per tonne. The BT-5 was 5.58 meters long 2.23 meters wide 2.25 meters tall and weighed 11.5 tonnes and the hull was riveted together with the front part shaped like a truncated pyramid. 

== Combat History ==
The first conflict the BT-5 saw was the Spanish Civil War, where 100 BT-5s saw action with the Second Spanish Republic. Francoist Spain would also use some that were captured during the war. The next conflict the BT-5 saw was the Soviet-Japanese Border Conflict against the Empire of Japan. The BT-5 played a major role in the Battle of Khalkin Gol, as they were so fast that Japanese anti-tank gunners could not hit them. But the BT-5 was vulnerable at close range to Japanese soldiers with Molotov cocktail&#x27;s. The tank was praised post-battle reports after the conflict at Khalkin Gol. 

The next time the BT-5 saw combat was the Soviet invasion of Poland. In the joint Soviet-German Invasion of Poland, where they did not see very much action. The first real challenge for the BT-5 was the Winter War against Finland, where the BT-5 was unable to get past the Finnish defensive line, the Mannerheim Line, where their thin armor was easily penetrated by Finnish anti-tank guns. The Soviets lost many BT-5s during this conflict. Finnish soldiers used Molotov cocktails and threw them at a weak point near the engine, which, when hit, would cause the engine to catch fire and explode. Soviet divisions would be surrounded by Finish units and as fuel and spare parts began to run out the Soviets would use the tanks as makeshift bunkers by burying them up to their turrets. The Finnish Army would often capture many BT-5&#x27;s in this condition but even if the tanks were still operable the Finns were unable to tow them due to a lack of vehicles able to tow the tanks so they would salvage the tanks for anything useful such as the DP machine guns. By the end of the Winter War Finland did not have a single complete BT-5.

After the Winter War, there were still hundreds of BT-5s in service, but many were replaced with the BT-7 and other tanks. On June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany launched Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, which caught the Soviets off guard. Soviet losses, including tanks, were appalling at the beginning of the invasion. The BT-5 would be used throughout the rest of the war, but not as much as its younger brother, the BT-7, or the new T-34, due to a lack of spare parts for the tank. The BT-5 was used the most at the beginning of the invasion of the Soviet Union and near the end of the war when spare parts were available.

== In Spanish service ==
About 100 BT-5s were used by the Second Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War. The crew of these BT-5s were members of the International Brigades that were trained in the Soviet Union by Soviet tankers. The tanks first saw action in the Zaragoza Offensive on October 13, 1937. 13 tanks were lost and 12 more were later lost between December 1937 and February 1938 at the Battle of Teruel. A few BT-5s were captured by Francoist Spain and used against the Second Spanish Republic. 

== In Chinese service ==
The Chinese Nationalist Army used 4 BT-5&#x27;s against the Imperial Japanese Army in the Second Sino-Japanese War.

== In Finnish service ==
Finland used many BT-5&#x27;s along with other tanks they captured during the Winter War and the Continuation War. The Finnish Army mainly used them in a defensive role as they were mainly on the defense during the Winter War.

<text>The BT-7 was the last of the BT series of Soviet cavalry tanks that were produced in large numbers between 1935 and 1940. It was lightly armoured, but reasonably well-armed for the time, and had much better mobility than other contemporary tank designs. The BT tanks were known by the nickname &quot;Betka&quot; from the acronym, or its diminutive, &quot;Betushka.&quot;

The BT-7&#x27;s successor was the famous T-34 medium tank, introduced in 1940, which replaced all of the Soviet fast tanks, infantry tanks, and medium tanks then in service.

==Development==

The first prototypes of the BT-7 had a distinctive canted-ellipse shaped turret mounting both the main gun and a coaxial machine-gun. The specification also called for the project to allow for the installation of new guns without any significant change to the framework: the 76 mm KT-26 or PS-3 main gun (a short-barreled howitzer) and the 45 mm 20K model 1932/38, a long-barreled, high-velocity gun useful against tanks, but less effective than the 76 mm gun against infantry.

In the rear of the turret, there was a rotating drum-type magazine for 18 45 mm shells or a radio station. The prototype underwent an extensive testing program in the summer and autumn of 1934. As a result of this testing, it was felt that a machine-gun was unnecessary on a tank with a 3-man crew, especially as it made the assembly of the turret more complicated.

Therefore, in early 1935, the tank went into production with a simpler design, incorporating the turret from the BT-5. (However, the idea of a wheeled/tracked vehicle with a 76 mm cannon was not abandoned and the plant was commissioned to develop a new BT-7 turret from the turret of the T-26-4.) In the production model, a cylindrical turret housed a 45 mm 20K gun with a DT machine gun. On some of the tanks, a model 71-TC radio with frame antenna was installed.

The crew consisted of three men: the commander (who also served as the gunner); the loader and the driver. In 1937, the company launched production of the BT-7 with a conical turret. The main armament remained the same, but the ammunition was increased to 44 rounds. All serving tanks now installed the DT machine gun in the rear niche. For the firing of the gun and coaxial machine gun at night, the tank was equipped with two special projector-type headlamps, and a mask placed on the gun. Subsequently, these lights were retrofitted to earlier models of the tank. Improvements were also made to the drive wheels, caterpillar tracks and gearbox by 1938.

In parallel with the main modification, 153 BT-7A artillery tanks were produced between 1936 and 1938. These were fitted with a larger turret and a 76 mm KT-type gun with 50 rounds of ammunition (40 in a tank with a portable radio).

In 1938, four experimental BT-8 tanks mounted with V-2 diesel engines were produced. After comparative tests of the BT-7 and BT-8, the diesel tanks were put into production in 1940 (under the designation BT-7M) with the powerplants being produced in a separate plant of the Voroshilovets factory to ensure supply. The diesel tanks were more fuel efficient, and the petrol-powered tanks were soon placed into reserve.

Several experimental tanks were conceived based on the BT series, for example the wheeled BT-IS, designed by N.F. Tsyganov, a platoon commander in the 4th Armoured Regiment of the Ukraine Military District and self-taught designer. The type successfully passed field tests, but was not ordered in bulk. Another Tsyganov design was the SV-2 &quot;Cherepakha&quot; &quot;(&quot;turtle&quot;, черепаха)&quot;, with a new design of hull and turret. There was also the command tank KBT-7 with a fixed superstructure, the OT-7 mounting a flamethrower, the KhBT-7 designed to protect from toxic contamination and lay smokescreens, the SBT bridgelayer and the TTBT-7 and Thubten-7 radio-controlled tanks (known at the time as Teletanks). Finland converted 18 captured tanks into BT-42 assault guns.

Shortly before Operation Barbarossa (the German invasion of the Soviet Union), the BT-7 underwent an up-armoring program. In 1940, the Ilyich Iron and Steel Works in Mariupol produced 50 sets of hinged homogeneous armor for the BT-7M, which increased the weight of the test tank to 18 tons. Unfortunately, nothing is known about the installation of these kits to military units.

Between 1935 and 1940, 5753 BT-7 tanks of all modifications were built.

== Combat experience ==
In June 1941, at the outset of Barbarossa, the BT-7 was used as the main cavalry tank of the Soviet army. Tank losses were high, with over 2,000 BT-7 series tanks lost in the first 12 months on the Eastern Front. Hundreds more had been immobilized before the invasion by poor maintenance, and these had to be abandoned as the Soviet forces withdrew eastward. The BT-7 continued to be operated by the armored and mechanized forces of the Red Army for almost the entire war, but in greatly-decreased numbers after 1941.

By 1 November 1942, 32 BT-7 tanks were captured by Romanian forces. BT-7 series tanks continued in use by the Soviets in the Far East, against Japanese forces which lacked the heavy tanks of their German allies. BT-7 tanks were employed against Japanese forces in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in 1939 and the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation in 1945.

== Survivors ==

Although many BT-7 tanks were produced, as of early 2018, there is only one known remaining BT-7 in operational order, in Belarus.

== Organization and use ==

The Table of Organization and Equipment for a typical Soviet light tank brigade in 1939 is as follows:
*3 tank battalions, each containing:
**Three tank companies, each with 17 BT-7 or T-26 tanks;
**1 signal platoon;
**1 anti-tank platoon with three 45 mm antitank guns;
**1 antiaircraft machine gun (AA MG) platoon
*1 reserve tank company, with eight BT-7 or T-26 tanks;
*1 signal company, with five T-37A tanks;
*1 motorized infantry battalion, containing
**3 motorized rifle companies;
**1 signal platoon;
**1 antitank platoon with three 45 mm antitank guns;
**1 AA MG platoon
*1 additional AA MG platoon in brigade headquarters;
*1 motor transport battalion;
*1 reconnaissance battalion;
*1 pioneer company;
*1 medical company;
*1 chemical company (flamethrowers).

<text>&quot;The Liberty Bell&quot; (1893) is an American military march composed by John Philip Sousa.



== History ==
&quot;The Liberty Bell&quot;, at the time a new composition as yet untitled, was written for Sousa&#x27;s unfinished operetta &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Deputy&quot; before financing for the show fell through. Shortly afterwards, while attending the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Sousa and his band manager George Hinton watched the spectacle &quot;America&quot;, in which a backdrop depicting the Liberty Bell was lowered. Hinton suggested &quot;The Liberty Bell&quot; for the title of Sousa&#x27;s unnamed march. Coincidentally, Sousa received a letter from his wife saying their son had marched in a parade in honor of the Liberty Bell. Sousa agreed, and he sold &quot;The Liberty Bell&quot; sheet music to the John Church Company for publication; the new march was an immediate success. The march is played as part of an exhibit in the Liberty Bell Center.

The United States Marine Band has played &quot;The Liberty Bell&quot; march at five of the last seven presidential inaugurations: the 1993 inauguration of President Bill Clinton, the 2005 inauguration of President George W. Bush, the 2009 and 2013 inaugurations of President Barack Obama, and the 2017 and 2025 inaugurations of President Donald Trump.

The ship&#x27;s bell from the &quot;SS John Philip Sousa&quot;, a World War II Liberty ship, is housed at the Marine Barracks and is used by The President&#x27;s Own in select performances of the march.

&quot;The Liberty Bell&quot; is also the official march of the Canadian Forces Public Affairs Branch.

== Composition ==
The march follows Sousa&#x27;s &quot;extended&quot; trio form: &quot;HEAD (intro, 1st strain, 2nd strain), TRIO (trio A), interlude, Triumphal return (trio B + final trio)&quot;, which since the &quot;Liberty Bell&quot; has become a standard for military marches. The trio uses tubular bells to symbolize the Liberty Bell ringing.

== Instrumentation ==

This is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, cymbals, bass drum, snare drum, and strings.

== Use in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; ==
A version of the march, performed by the Band of the Grenadier Guards and published in 1938, was used as the opening theme of the British TV comedy program &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; (1969–1974). Cast member Terry Gilliam, the only American member of the troupe, argued for the use of &quot;The Liberty Bell&quot; because it had fallen into the public domain by that time and could thus be used without the need to pay royalties. He has said the piece was chosen because the troupe thought it would not be associated with the program&#x27;s content, and that the first bell strike and subsequent melody would give the impression of getting &quot;straight down to business.&quot;

The Monty Python mode of presenting the tune was with a single strike of the bell, lifted from the third section and increased in volume, followed by a strain of each of the first two sections, followed by the famous stomping foot animation and a noticeably flatulent &quot;splat&quot; sound reminiscent of a whoopee cushion (the first 13 episodes used a &quot;raspberry&quot;). At the end of the film &quot;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;, the entire march was played over the closing credits.

== Other uses ==
NASA played the march as wake-up calls for two Space Shuttle missions: STS-61-C on January 12–18, 1986, and STS-63 on February 3–11, 1995.

SpaceX used the march as background music for their video &quot;How Not to Land an Orbital Rocket Booster&quot;, a compilation of failed rocket landings to celebrate their efforts in pioneering orbital launch vehicle reusability.

<text>Österland (&#x27;Eastland&#x27;) was a medieval term used for the southern part of Finland, one of the four traditional lands of Sweden. The term occurs in documents approximately between 1350–1470 and gradually fell out of use by the end of the 15th century. Before this period the term was used in plural, Österlanden (&#x27;Easternlands&#x27;).

With the exception of Old Finland that was ceded to Russia in 1721, Finland remained a part of Sweden until after the Finnish War of 1808–09, when it was ceded to Russia and came to constitute the autonomous Russian Grand Duchy of Finland.

== History ==
Due to the Northern Crusades against Finns, Tavastians and Karelians and the Swedish Colonisation during the 13th century, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Catholic Church incorporated Southern Finland. The details of this process are not known. The conquest took place at the same time or later than Sweden was united under one king.

In the wake of the crusades, possibly thousands of Christian Swedish settlers gradually moved into the western and southern coasts of Österlanden (now Finland) from the 13th century onwards until the 1350s. There is no conclusive archaeological or toponymical proof of Norse-speaking inhabitants in Finland during earlier times outside Åland.

On 15 February 1362, when King Haakon was elected as co-regent with his father Magnus Eriksson at the Mora Meadow, he delivered a proclamation in which he granted Österland, then corresponding to the diocese of Turku, a permanent right to take part in the election of the Swedish kings. Consequently, Österland became an integral part of the Swedish kingdom.

In 1581, the provinces of the area were declared a grand principality by King John III of Sweden, who as a prince, in 1556, had been granted a part of that territory as a duchy created beside other duchies ruled by his brothers. The creation of that Duchy was chiefly a part of the legacy of King Gustav Vasa. While the Duchy did not last as an administrative unit, the titular grand principality did, for over two centuries and ultimately, after 1809, evolved into an autonomous duchy under the Russian Empire.

<text>The Panzer I was a light tank produced by Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Its name is short for &#x27; (German for &quot;armored fighting vehicle mark I&quot;), abbreviated as &#x27;. The tank&#x27;s official German ordnance inventory designation was &quot;Sd.Kfz. 101&quot; (&quot;special purpose vehicle 101&quot;).

Design of the Panzer I began in 1932 and mass production began in 1934. Intended only as a training tank to introduce the concept of armored warfare to the German Army, the Panzer I saw combat in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, in Poland, France, the Soviet Union and North Africa during the Second World War, and in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Experiences with the Panzer I during the Spanish Civil War helped shape the German Panzerwaffe&#x27;s invasion of Poland in 1939 and France in 1940. By 1941, the Panzer I chassis design was used as the basis of tank destroyers and assault guns. There were attempts to upgrade the Panzer I throughout its service history, including by foreign nations, to extend the design&#x27;s lifespan. It continued to serve in the Spanish Armed Forces until 1954.

The Panzer I&#x27;s performance in armored combat was limited by its thin armor and light armament of two machine guns, which were never intended for use against armored targets, rather being ideal for infantry suppression, in line with inter-war doctrine. As a design intended for training, the Panzer I was less capable than some other contemporary light tank designs, such as the Polish 7TP and the Soviet T-26, although it was still relatively advanced compared to older designs, such as the Renault FT, still in service in several nations. Although lacking in armored combat as a tank, it formed a large part of Germany&#x27;s mechanized forces and was used in all major campaigns between September 1939 and December 1941, where it still performed much useful service against entrenched infantry and other &quot;soft&quot; targets, which were unable to respond even against thin armor, and who were highly vulnerable to machine gun fire. The small, vulnerable light tank, along with its somewhat more powerful successor the Panzer II, would soon be surpassed as a front-line armored combat vehicle by more powerful German tanks, such as the Panzer III, and later the Panzer IV, Panzer V, and Panzer VI; nevertheless, the Panzer I&#x27;s contribution to the early victories of Nazi Germany during World War II was significant. Later in the war, the turrets of many obsolete Panzer Is and Panzer IIs were repurposed as gun turrets on defensive fighting positions, particularly on the Atlantic Wall.

==Development history==
The post-World War I Treaty of Versailles of 1919 prohibited the design, manufacture and deployment of tanks within the Reichswehr. Paragraph Twenty-four of the treaty provided for a 100,000-mark fine and imprisonment of up to six months for anybody who &quot;[manufactured] armored vehicles, tanks or similar machines, which may be turned to military use&quot;.

Despite the manpower and technical limitations imposed on the German Army by the Treaty of Versailles, several Reichswehr officers established a clandestine general staff to study World War I and develop future strategies and tactics. Although at first the concept of the tank as a mobile weapon of war met with apathy, German industry was encouraged to look into tank design, while quiet cooperation was undertaken with the Soviet Union. There was also minor military cooperation with Sweden, including the extraction of technical data that proved invaluable to early German tank design. As early as 1926 the German companies Krupp, Rheinmetall and Daimler-Benz were contracted to develop prototype tanks armed with a 75 mm cannon. These were designed under the cover name &quot;Großtraktor&quot; (large tractor) to veil the true purpose of the vehicle. By 1930 a light tank armed with rapid-fire machineguns was to be developed under the cover name &quot;Leichttraktor&quot; (light tractor). The six produced &quot;Großtraktor&quot; were later put into service for a brief period with the 1  Panzer Division; the &quot;Leichttraktor&quot; remained in testing until 1935.

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, German tank theory was pioneered by two figures: General Oswald Lutz and his chief of staff, Lieutenant Colonel Heinz Guderian. Guderian became the more influential of the two and his ideas were widely publicized. Like his contemporary, Sir Percy Hobart, Guderian initially envisioned an armored corps (&quot;panzerkorps&quot;) composed of several types of tanks. This included a slow infantry tank, armed with a small-caliber cannon and several machine guns. The infantry tank, according to Guderian, was to be heavily armored to defend against enemy anti-tank guns and artillery. He also envisioned a fast breakthrough tank, similar to the British cruiser tank, which was to be armored against enemy anti-tank weapons and have a large, 75 mm (2.95 in) main gun. Lastly, Germany needed a heavy tank, armed with a 150 mm (5.9 in) cannon to defeat enemy fortifications, and even stronger armor. Such a tank required a weight of 70 to 100  tonnes and was completely impractical given the manufacturing capabilities of the day.

Soon after rising to power in Germany, Adolf Hitler approved the creation of Germany&#x27;s first panzer divisions. Simplifying his earlier proposal, Guderian suggested the design of a main combat vehicle, which would be developed into the Panzer III, and a breakthrough tank, the Panzer IV. No existing design appealed to Guderian. As a stopgap, the German Army ordered a preliminary vehicle to train German tank crews. This became the Panzer I.

The Panzer I&#x27;s design history can be traced to the British Carden Loyd tankette, of which it borrowed much of its track and suspension design. After six prototypes &quot;Kleintraktor&quot; were produced the cover name was changed to &quot;Krupp-Traktor&quot; whereas the development codename was changed to &quot;Landwirtschaftlicher Schlepper&quot; (La S) (Agricultural Tractor). The La S was intended not just to train Germany&#x27;s panzer troops, but to prepare Germany&#x27;s industry for the mass production of tanks in the near future; a difficult engineering feat for the time. The armament of production versions was to be two 7.92 mm MG 13 machine guns in a rotating turret. Machine guns were known to be largely useless against even the lightest tank armor of the time, restricting the Panzer  I to a training and anti-infantry role by design.

The final official designation, assigned in 1938, was &quot;Panzerkampfwagen  I&quot; (M.G.) with special ordnance number &quot;Sd.Kfz. 101&quot;. The first 150 tanks (1./LaS, 1st series LaS, Krupp-Traktor), produced in 1934, did not include the rotating turret and were used for crew training. Following these, production was switched to the combat version of the tank. The Ausf. A was under-armored, with steel plate of only 13 millimeters (0.51 in) at its thickest. The tank had several design flaws, including suspension problems, which made the vehicle pitch at high velocities, and engine overheating. The driver was positioned inside the chassis and used conventional steering levers to control the tank, while the commander was positioned in the turret where he also acted as a gunner. The two crewmen could communicate by means of a voice tube. Machine gun ammunition was stowed in five bins, containing various numbers of 25-round magazines. 1,190 of the Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf. A were built in three series (2.-4./LaS). Further 25 were built as command tanks.&quot;

Many of the problems in the Ausf. A were corrected with the introduction of the Ausf. B. The air-cooled engine (producing just was replaced by a water-cooled, six-cylinder Maybach NL 38 TR, developing , and the gearbox was changed to a more reliable model. The larger engine required the extension of the vehicle&#x27;s chassis by 40 cm (16 in), and this allowed the improvement of the tank&#x27;s suspension, adding another bogie wheel and raising the tensioner. The tank&#x27;s weight increased by 0.4 tons. Production of the Ausf. B began in August 1936 and finished in the summer of 1937 after 399 had been built in two series (5a-6a/LaS). Further 159 were built as command tanks in two series, and 295 chassis were built as turretless training tanks. 147 more training tanks were built as convertible chassis with hardened armor with the option to upgrade them to full combat status by adding a superstructure and turret.

===Other frontline-type Panzer I tanks===
Two more combat versions of the Panzer I were designed and produced between 1939 and 1942. By this stage, the design concept had been superseded by medium and heavy tanks and neither variant was produced in sufficient numbers to have a real impact on the progress of the war. These new tanks had nothing in common with either the Ausf. A or B except name. One of these, the Panzer I Ausf. C, was designed jointly between Krauss-Maffei and Daimler-Benz in 1939 to provide an amply armored and armed reconnaissance light tank. The Ausf. C boasted a completely new chassis and turret, a modern torsion-bar suspension and five &quot;Schachtellaufwerk&quot;-style interleaved roadwheels. It also had a maximum armor thickness of 30  millimeters (1.18 in), over twice that of either the Ausf. A or B, and was armed with a Mauser EW 141 semi-automatic anti-tank rifle, with a 50-round drum, firing powerful armor-piercing 7.92×94mm Patronen 318 anti-tank rounds. Forty of these tanks were produced, along with six prototypes. Two tanks were deployed to 1st Panzer Division in 1943, and the other thirty-eight were deployed to the LVIII Panzer Reserve Corps during the Normandy landings.

The second vehicle, the Ausf. F, was as different from the Ausf. C as it was from the Ausf. A and B. Intended as an infantry support tank, the Panzer I Ausf. F had a maximum armor thickness of 80 millimeters (3.15 in) and weighed between 18 and 21 tonnes. The Ausf. F was armed with two 7.92 mm MG-34s. Thirty were produced in 1940, and a second order of 100 was later canceled. In order to compensate for the increased weight, a new Maybach HL45 Otto engine was used, allowing a maximum road speed of 25 kilometers per hour (15.5 mph) and used five overlapping road wheels per side, dropping the Ausf. C&#x27;s interleaved units. Eight of the thirty tanks produced were sent to the 1st Panzer Division in 1943 and saw combat at the Battle of Kursk. The rest were given to several army schools for training and evaluation purposes.

==Combat history==
===Spanish Civil War===
On 18 July 1936, war broke out on the Iberian Peninsula as Spain dissolved into a state of civil war. After the chaos of the initial uprising, two opposing sides coalesced and began to consolidate their position—the Popular front (the Republicans) and the Spanish Nationalist front. In an early example of a proxy war, both sides quickly received support from other countries, most notably the Soviet Union and Germany as both wanted to test their tactics and equipment. The first shipment of foreign tanks, 50 Soviet T-26s, arrived on 15 October. The shipment was under the surveillance of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and Germany immediately responded by sending 41 Panzer Is to Spain a few days later. This first shipment was followed by four more shipments of Panzer I Ausf. Bs, with 122 vehicles shipped in total.

The first shipment of Panzer Is was brought under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma in Gruppe Thoma (also referred to as Panzergruppe Drohne). Gruppe Thoma formed part of Gruppe Imker, the ground formations of the German Condor Legion, who fought on the side of Franco&#x27;s Nationalists. Between July and October, a rapid Nationalist advance from Seville to Toledo placed them in position to take the Spanish capital, Madrid. The Nationalist advance and the fall of the town of Illescas to Nationalist armies on 18 October 1936 caused the government of the Popular Front&#x27;s Second Republic, including President Manuel Azaña, to flee to Barcelona and Valencia. In an attempt to stem the Nationalist tide and gain crucial time for Madrid&#x27;s defense, Soviet armor was deployed south of the city under the command of Colonel Krivoshein before the end of October. At this time, several T-26 tanks under the command of Captain Paul Arman were thrown into a Republican counterattack directed towards the town of Torrejon de Velasco in an attempt to cut off the Nationalist advance north. This was the first recorded tank battle in the Spanish Civil War. Despite initial success, poor communication between the Soviet Republican armor and Spanish Republican infantry caused the isolation of Captain Arman&#x27;s force and the subsequent destruction of a number of tanks. This battle also marked the first use of the molotov cocktail against tanks. Ritter von Thoma&#x27;s Panzer Is fought for the Nationalists only days later on 30 October, and immediately experienced problems. As the Nationalist armor advanced, it was engaged by the Commune de Paris battalion, equipped with Soviet BA-6 armored cars. The 45 mm gun in the BA-6 was more than sufficient to knock out the poorly armored Panzer I at ranges below 500 meters (550 yd).

Although the Panzer I would participate in almost every major Nationalist offensive of the war, the Nationalist army began to deploy more and more captured T-26 tanks to offset their disadvantage in protection and firepower. At one point, von Thoma offered up to 500 pesetas for each T-26 captured. Although the Panzer I was initially able to knock out the T-26 at close range—150 meters (165 yd) or less—using an armor-piercing 7.92 mm bullet, the Republican tanks began to engage at ranges where they were immune to the machine guns of the Panzer I.

The Panzer I was upgraded in order to increase its lethality. On 8 August 1937, Major General García Pallasar received a note from Generalísimo Francisco Franco that expressed the need for a Panzer I (or &quot;negrillo&quot;, as their Spanish crews called them) with a 20 mm gun. Ultimately, the piece chosen was the Breda Model 1935, due to the simplicity of the design over competitors such as the German Flak 30. Furthermore, the 20 mm Breda was capable of perforating 40 millimeters of armor at 250 meters (1.57 in at 275 yd), which was more than sufficient to penetrate the frontal armor of the T-26. Although originally 40 Italian CV.35 light tanks were ordered with the Breda in place of their original armament, this order was subsequently canceled after it was thought that the adaptation of the same gun to the Panzer I would yield better results. Prototypes were ready by September 1937 and an order was placed after successful results. The mounting of the Breda in the Panzer I required the original turret to be opened at the top and then extended by a vertical supplement. Four of these tanks were finished at the Armament Factory of Seville, but further production was canceled as it was decided sufficient numbers of Republican T-26 tanks had been captured to fulfill the Nationalist leadership&#x27;s request for more lethal tanks. The Breda modification was not particularly liked by German crews, as the unprotected gap in the turret, designed to allow the tank&#x27;s commander to aim, was found to be a dangerous weak point.

In late 1938, another Panzer I was sent to the Armament Factory of Seville in order to mount a 45 mm gun, captured from a Soviet tank (a T-26 or BT-5). A second was sent sometime later in order to exchange the original armament for a 37 mm Maklen anti-tank gun, which had been deployed to Asturias in late 1936 on the Soviet ship A. Andreiev. It remains unknown to what extent these trials and adaptations were completed, although it is safe to assume neither adaptation was successful beyond the drawing board.

===World War II in China===
In 1937, around ten Panzer I Ausf. As were sold to the Republic of China (ROC) during a period of strong co-operative ties between the ROC and Nazi Germany, which were subsequently fielded in the Battle of Nanjing by the 3rd Armored Battalion of the ROC&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army (NRA) to fight against the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA).

Following the fall of Nanking, the Chinese Panzer I Ausf. As were captured by the Japanese and put on display at the Yasukuni Shrine. Because of the close relationship between Hitler&#x27;s Germany and Imperial Japan by that time, the Chinese Panzer I Ausf. A was instead labelled as &quot;Made in the USSR&quot; (the USSR being the common enemy of these two strongly anti-communist nations).

===World War II in Europe===
During the initial campaigns of World War II, Germany&#x27;s light tanks, including the Panzer I, formed the bulk of its armored strength. In March 1938, the German Army marched into Austria, experiencing a mechanical breakdown rate of up to thirty percent. However, the experience revealed to Guderian several faults within the German &quot;Panzerkorps&quot; and he subsequently improved logistical support. In October 1938, Germany occupied Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Sudetenland, and the remainder of the country in March 1939. The capture of Czechoslovakia allowed several Czech tank designs, such as the Panzer 38(t), and their subsequent variants and production, to be incorporated into the German Army&#x27;s strength. It also prepared German forces for the invasion of Poland.

====Poland and the campaign in the west====
On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland using seventy-two divisions (including 16 reserve infantry divisions in OKH reserves), including seven panzer divisions (1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 10., &quot;Kempf&quot;) and four light divisions (1., 2., 3., 4.). Three days later, France and Britain declared war on Germany. The seven panzer and four light divisions were arrayed in five armies, forming two army groups. The battalion strength of the 1st Panzer Division included no less than fourteen Panzer Is, while the other six divisions included thirty-four. About 2,700 tanks were available for the invasion of Poland, but only 310 of the heavier Panzer III and IV tanks were available. Furthermore, 350 were of Czech design—the rest were either Panzer Is or Panzer IIs. The invasion was swift and the last Polish pockets of resistance surrendered on 6 October. The entire campaign had lasted five weeks (with help of the Soviet forces, which attacked on 17 September), and the success of Germany&#x27;s tanks in the campaign was summed up in response to Hitler on 5 September: when asked if it had been the dive bombers who destroyed a Polish artillery regiment, Guderian replied, &quot;No, our panzers!&quot;

Some 832 German tanks (including 320 PzI, 259 PzII, 40 Pz III, 76 PzIV, 77 Pz35(t), 13 PzBef III, 7 PzBef 38(t), 34 other PzBef and some Pz38(t)) were lost during the campaign, approximately 341 of which were never to return to service. This represented about a third of Germany&#x27;s armor deployed for the Polish campaign. During the campaign, no less than half of Germany&#x27;s tanks were unavailable due to maintenance issues or enemy action, and of all tanks, the Panzer I proved the most vulnerable to Polish anti-tank weapons.

Furthermore, it was found that the handling of armored forces during the campaign left much to be desired. During the beginning of Guderian&#x27;s attack in northern Poland, his corps was held back to coordinate with infantry for quite a while, preventing a faster advance. It was only after Army Group South had its attention taken from Warsaw at the Battle of Bzura that Guderian&#x27;s armor was fully unleashed. There were still lingering tendencies to reserve Germany&#x27;s armor, even if in independent divisions, to cover an infantry advance or the flanks of advancing infantry armies. Although tank production was increased to 125 tanks per month after the Polish Campaign, losses forced the Germans to draw further strength from Czech tank designs, and light tanks continued to form the majority of Germany&#x27;s armored strength.

Months later, Panzer Is participated in Operation Weserübung—the invasion of Denmark and Norway.

Despite its obsolescence, the Panzer I was also used in the invasion of France in May 1940. Of 2,574 tanks available for the campaign, no fewer than 523 were Panzer Is, while there were 627 Panzer IIIs and IVs, 955 Panzer II, 106 Czech Panzer 35(t), and 228 Panzer 38(t). For their defense, the French boasted up to 4,000 tanks, including 300 Char B1, armed with a 47 mm (1.7 in) gun in the turret and a larger 75 mm (2.95 in) low-velocity gun in the hull. The French also had around 250 Somua S-35, widely regarded as one of the best tanks of the period, armed with the same 47 mm main gun and protected by almost 55 mm (2.17 in) of armor at its thickest point. Nevertheless, the French also deployed over 3,000 light tanks, including about 500 World War I-vintage FT-17s. German armor enjoyed multiple advantages: Radios allowed them to coordinate faster than their British or French counterparts, while the Germans also had superior tactical doctrine and markedly faster speed.

====North Africa and Balkans====

Setbacks in the Italian invasion of Egypt caused Hitler to dispatch aircraft to Sicily, and a blocking force (the Afrika Korps) to support their ally in the North Africa campaign. This blocking force was put under the command of Lieutenant General Erwin Rommel and included the motorized 5th Light Division and the 15th Panzer Division. This force landed at Tripoli on 12 February 1941 shortly after the British Operation Compass had routed and captured an Italian army in Italian Libya. Upon arrival, Rommel had around 150 tanks, about half Panzer III and IV. The rest were Panzer Is and IIs, although the Panzer I was soon replaced. On 6 April 1941, Germany attacked both Yugoslavia and Greece, with fourteen divisions invading Greece from neighboring Bulgaria, which by then had joined the Tripartite Pact. The invasion of Yugoslavia included six panzer divisions which still fielded the Panzer I. Yugoslavia surrendered 17 April 1941, and Greece fell on 30 April 1941.

====Against Soviet Russia====

The final major campaign in which the Panzer I formed a large portion of the armored strength was &quot;Operation Barbarossa&quot;, 22 June 1941. The 3,300 German tanks included about 410 Panzer Is. By the end of the month, a large portion of the Red Army found itself trapped in the Minsk pocket, and by 21 September Kiev had fallen, thereby allowing the Germans to concentrate on their ultimate objective, Moscow. Despite the success of Germany&#x27;s armor in the Soviet Union, between June and September most German officers were shocked to find their tanks were inferior to newer Soviet models, the medium T-34 and heavy KV tanks. As seen during the Spanish Civil War only five years earlier, the Panzer I was clearly no match for even the weakest of Soviet armor it encountered, with even armored cars such as the BA-10 proving capable of defeating the Panzer I when fitted with medium-caliber anti-tank weapons. Army Group North quickly realized that none of the tank guns currently in use by German armor could reliably penetrate the thick frontal armor of the KV-1. The performance of the Red Army during the Battle of Moscow and the growing numbers of new Soviet tanks made it obvious the Panzer I was not largely suitable for this front of war. Some less battle-worthy Panzer Is were tasked with towing lorries and other light (mainly wheeled) vehicles through the thick mud of the Russian autumn to alleviate logistical and transportation issues and problems at the frontlines, whilst other Panzer Is were relegated for anti-partisan actions or rear-guard protection duties (such as defending airfields or other vital military installations on occupied enemy territory).

===Others===

After Germany, Spain fielded the largest number of Panzer I tanks. A total of 122 were exported to Spain during the Spanish Civil War, and, as late as 1945, Spain&#x27;s &quot;Brunete Armored Division&quot; fielded 93. The Panzer I remained in use in Spain until aid arrived from the United States in 1954 when they were replaced by the relatively modern M47 Patton. Between 1935 and 1936, an export version of the Panzer I Ausf. B, named the L.K.B. (&quot;Leichte Kampfwagen B&quot;), was designed for export to Bulgaria. Modifications included up-gunning to a 20 mm gun and fitting a Krupp M 311 V-8 gasoline engine. Although three examples were built, none were exported to Bulgaria, although a single Panzer I Ausf. A had previously been sold.

A final order was supplied to Hungary in 1942, totalling eight Ausf. Bs and six command versions. These were incorporated into the 1st Armored Division and saw combat in late 1942. At least 1 Panzer I Ausf. B was sent to the Army of the Independent State of Croatia.

The British The Tank Museum at Bovington Camp has a rare command version of the tank. The museum announced in 2023 that a Panzer I replica would take part in its 2023 Tiger Day and TANKFEST events. The replica was built in Belgium but is based on one preserved in a Spanish museum. It uses a modern engine and is marked in colours used during the Spanish Civil War.

==Variants==
Between 1934 and the mid-1940s, several variants of the Panzer I were designed, especially during the later years of its combat history. Because they were obsolescent from their introduction, incapable of defeating foreign armor, and outclassed by newer German tanks, the Panzer I chassis were increasingly adapted as tank destroyers and other variants. One of the best-known variants was the &quot;kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen&quot; (&quot;small armored command vehicle&quot;), built on the Ausf. A and Ausf. B chassis—200 of these were manufactured. The Panzer I Ausf. B chassis was also used to build the German Army&#x27;s first tracked tank destroyer, the Panzerjäger I. This vehicle was armed with a Czech 47 mm (1.85 in) anti-tank gun.

<doc id="199491" wikidata="Q1183443" url="?curid=199491" title="The Crucible">
<text>The Crucible is a 1953 play by the American playwright Arthur Miller. It is a dramatized and partially fictionalized story of the Salem witch trials that took place in the Province of Massachusetts Bay from 1692 to 1693. Miller wrote the play as an allegory for McCarthyism, when the United States government persecuted people accused of being communists. Miller was questioned by the House of Representatives&#x27; Committee on Un-American Activities in 1956 and convicted of contempt of Congress for refusing to identify others present at meetings he had attended.

The play was first performed at the Martin Beck Theatre on Broadway on January 22, 1953, starring E. G. Marshall, Beatrice Straight and Madeleine Sherwood. Miller felt that this production was too stylized and cold, and the reviews for it were largely hostile (although &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted &quot;a powerful play [in a] driving performance&quot;). The production won the 1953 Tony Award for Best Play. A year later, a new production succeeded and the play became a classic. It is regarded as a central work in the canon of American drama.

==Synopsis==
===Act One===

The opening narration explains the context of Salem, Massachusetts, and the Puritan colonists of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, which the narrator depicts as an isolated theocracy in constant conflict with Native Americans. The narrator speculates that the lack of civil liberties, isolation from civilization, and lack of stability in Massachusetts caused latent internal tensions which would contribute to the events depicted in the play.

The remainder of Act One is set in the attic of local preacher Samuel Parris. His ten-year-old daughter, Betty Parris, lies motionless. The previous evening, Reverend Parris discovered Betty, some other girls, and his Barbadian slave, Tituba, dancing naked in the forest and engaged in some sort of pagan ritual. The village is rife with rumors of witchcraft and a crowd gathers outside Rev. Parris&#x27; house. Parris becomes concerned that the event will cause him to be removed from his position as the town&#x27;s preacher. He questions the girls&#x27; apparent ringleader, his niece Abigail Williams, whom Parris has been forced to adopt after her parents were brutally killed in King Philip&#x27;s War. Abigail denies they were engaged in witchcraft, claiming that they had been dancing. Afterwards, the wealthy and influential Thomas Putnam and his wife Ann arrive. At the Putnams&#x27; urging, Parris reluctantly reveals that he has invited Reverend John Hale, an expert in witchcraft and demonology, to investigate and leaves to address the crowd.

The other girls involved in the incident join Abigail and a briefly roused Betty, who attempts to jump out of the window. Abigail coerces and threatens the others to &quot;stick to their story&quot; of merely dancing in the woods. The other girls are frightened of the truth being revealed (in actuality, they tried to conjure a curse against Elizabeth Proctor) and being labelled witches, so they go along with Abigail. Betty then faints back into unconsciousness.

John Proctor, a local farmer and husband of Elizabeth, enters. He sends the other girls out (including Mary Warren, his family&#x27;s maid) and confronts Abigail, who tells him that she and the girls were not performing witchcraft. It is revealed that Abigail once worked as a servant for the Proctors, and that she and John had an affair, for which she was fired. Abigail still harbors feelings for John and believes they are reciprocated, but John denies this. Abigail angrily mocks John for denying his true feelings for her. As they argue, a psalm is sung in the room downstairs. Betty bolts upright and begins screaming.

Rev. Parris runs back into the bedroom and various villagers arrive: Thomas and his wife, Ann, respected local woman Rebecca Nurse, and the Putnams&#x27; neighbor, farmer Giles Corey. The villagers, who had not heard the argument, assume that the singing of the psalm by the villagers in a room below had caused Betty&#x27;s screaming. Tensions between them soon emerge. Mrs. Putnam is a bereaved parent seven times over; she blames witchcraft for her losses and Betty&#x27;s ailment. The much more reasonable Rebecca suggests a doctor be called instead. Mr. Putnam and Corey have been feuding over land ownership. Parris is unhappy with his salary and living conditions as minister, and accuses Proctor of heading a conspiracy to oust him from the church. Abigail, standing quietly in a corner, witnesses all of this.

Reverend Hale arrives and begins his investigation. Before leaving, Giles fatefully remarks that he has noticed his wife reading unknown books and asks Hale to look into it. Hale questions Rev. Parris, Abigail and Tituba closely over the girls&#x27; activities in the woods. As the facts emerge, Abigail claims Tituba forced her to drink blood. Tituba counters that Abigail begged her to conjure a deadly curse. Parris threatens to whip Tituba to death if she does not confess to witchcraft. Tituba breaks down and falsely claims that the Devil is bewitching her and others in town. With prompting from Hale and Putnam, Tituba accuses Sarah Osborne and Sarah Good of witchcraft. Mrs. Putnam identifies Osborne as her former midwife and asserts that she must have killed her children. Abigail decides to play along with Tituba in order to prevent others from discovering her affair with Proctor, whose wife she had tried to curse out of jealousy. She leaps up, begins contorting wildly, and names Osborne and Good, as well as Bridget Bishop as having been &quot;dancing with the devil&quot;. Betty suddenly rises and begins mimicking Abigail&#x27;s movements and words, and accuses George Jacobs. As the curtain closes, the three continue with their accusations as Hale orders the arrest of the named people and sends for judges to try them.

===Act Two===
In a second narration, the narrator compares the Colony to post–World War II society, presenting Puritan fundamentalism as being similar to cultural norms in both the United States and the Soviet Union. Additionally, fears of Satanism taking place after incidents in Europe and the colonies are compared to fears of Communism following its implementation in Eastern Europe and China during the Cold War. (Again, narration not present in all versions.)

The remainder of Act Two is set in the Proctors‘ home. John and Elizabeth are incredulous that nearly forty people have been arrested for witchcraft based on the pronouncements of Abigail and the other girls. John knows their apparent possession and accusations of witchcraft are untrue, as Abigail told him as much when they were alone together in the first act, but is unsure of how to confess without revealing the affair. Elizabeth is disconcerted to learn her husband was alone with Abigail. She believes John still lusts after Abigail and tells him that as long as he does, he will never redeem himself.

Mary Warren enters and gives Elizabeth a &#x27;poppet&#x27; (doll-like puppet) that she made in court that day while sitting as a witness. Mary tells that thirty-nine have been arrested so far accused as witches, and they might be hanged. Mary also tells that Goody Osborne will be hanged, but Sarah Good&#x27;s life is safe because she confessed that she made a compact with Lucifer (Satan) to torment Christians. Angered that Mary is neglecting her duties, John threatens to beat her. Mary retorts that she is now an official in the court, she must have to go there on daily basis and she saved Elizabeth&#x27;s life that day, as Elizabeth was accused of witchcraft and was to be arrested until Mary spoke in her defense. Mary refuses to identify Elizabeth&#x27;s accuser, but Elizabeth surmises accurately that it must have been Abigail. She implores John to go to court and tell the judges that Abigail and the rest of the girls are pretending. John is reluctant, fearing that doing so will require him to publicly reveal his past adultery.

Reverend Hale arrives, stating that he is interviewing all the people named in the proceedings, including Elizabeth. He mentions that Rebecca Nurse was also named, but admits that he doubts her a witch due to her extreme piousness, though he emphasizes that anything is possible. Hale is skeptical about the Proctors&#x27; devotion to Christianity, noting that they do not attend church regularly and that one of their three sons has not yet been baptized; John replies that this is because he has no respect for Parris. Challenged to recite the Ten Commandments, John fatefully forgets &quot;thou shalt not commit adultery&quot;. When Hale questions her, Elizabeth is angered that he does not question Abigail first. Unsure of how to proceed, Hale prepares to take his leave. At Elizabeth&#x27;s urging, John tells Hale he knows that the girls&#x27; afflictions are fake. When Hale responds that many of the accused have confessed, John points out that they were bound to be hanged if they did not; Hale reluctantly acknowledges this point.

Suddenly, Giles Corey and Francis Nurse enter the house and inform John and Hale that both of their wives have been arrested on charges of witchcraft; respectively, Martha Corey for reading suspicious books and Rebecca Nurse has been suspected of sacrificing children. A posse led by clerk Ezekiel Cheever and town marshal George Herrick arrive soon afterwards and present a warrant for Elizabeth&#x27;s arrest, much to Hale&#x27;s surprise. Cheever picks up the poppet on Elizabeth&#x27;s table and finds a needle inside. He informs John that Abigail had a pain-induced fit earlier that evening and a needle was found stuck into her stomach; Abigail claimed that Elizabeth stabbed her with the needle through witchcraft, using a poppet as a conduit. John brings Mary into the room to tell the truth; Mary asserts that she made the doll and stuck the needle into it, and that Abigail saw her do so. Cheever is unconvinced and prepares to arrest Elizabeth.

John becomes greatly angered, tearing the arrest warrant to shreds and threatening Herrick and Cheever until Elizabeth calms him down and surrenders herself. He calls Hale a coward and asks him why the accusers&#x27; every utterance goes unchallenged. Hale is conflicted, but suggests that perhaps this misfortune has befallen Salem because of a great, secret crime that must be brought to light. Taking this to heart, John orders Mary to go to court with him and expose the other girls&#x27; lies, and she protests vehemently. Aware of John&#x27;s affair, she warns him that Abigail is willing to expose it if necessary. John is shocked but determines the truth must prevail, whatever the personal cost.

===Act Three===
The third act takes place thirty-seven days later in the General Court of Salem, during the trial of Martha Corey. Francis and Giles desperately interrupt the proceedings, demanding to be heard. The court is recessed and the men thrown out of the main room, reconvening in an adjacent room. John Proctor arrives with Mary Warren and they inform Deputy Governor Danforth and Judge Hathorne about the girls&#x27; lies. Danforth then informs an unaware John that Elizabeth is pregnant, and promises to spare her from execution until the child is born, hoping to persuade John to withdraw his case. John refuses to back down and submits a deposition signed by ninety-one locals attesting to the good character of Elizabeth, Rebecca Nurse and Martha Corey. Herrick also attests to John&#x27;s truthfulness as well.

The deposition is dismissed by Parris and Hathorne as illegal. Rev. Hale criticizes the decision and demands to know why the accused are forbidden to defend themselves. Danforth replies that given the &quot;invisible nature&quot; of witchcraft, the word of the accused and their advocates cannot be trusted. He then orders that all ninety-one persons named in the deposition be arrested for questioning. Giles Corey submits his own deposition, accusing Thomas Putnam of forcing his daughter to accuse George Jacobs in order to buy up his land (as convicted witches have to forfeit all of their property). When asked by Hathorne to reveal the source of his information, Giles refuses, fearing that he or she will also be arrested. When Danforth threatens him with arrest for contempt, Giles argues that he cannot be arrested for &quot;contempt of a hearing.&quot; Danforth then declares the court in session and Giles is arrested.

John submits Mary&#x27;s deposition, which declares that she was coerced to accuse people by Abigail. Abigail denies Mary&#x27;s assertions that they are pretending, and stands by her story about the poppet. When challenged by Parris and Hathorne to &#x27;pretend to be possessed&#x27;, Mary is too afraid to comply. John attacks Abigail&#x27;s character, revealing that she and the other girls were caught dancing naked in the woods by Rev. Parris on the night of Betty Parris&#x27; alleged &#x27;bewitchment&#x27;. When Danforth begins to question Abigail, she claims that Mary has begun to bewitch her with a cold wind and John loses his temper, calling Abigail a whore. He confesses their affair, says Abigail was fired from his household over it and that Abigail is trying to murder Elizabeth so that she may &quot;dance with me on my wife&#x27;s grave.&quot;

Danforth brings Elizabeth in to confirm this story, beforehand forbidding anyone to tell her about John&#x27;s testimony. Unaware of John&#x27;s public confession, Elizabeth fears that Abigail has revealed the affair in order to discredit John and lies, saying that there was no affair, and that she fired Abigail out of wild suspicion. Hale begs Danforth to reconsider his judgement, now agreeing Abigail is &quot;false&quot;, but to no avail; Danforth throws out this testimony based solely upon John&#x27;s earlier assertion that Elizabeth would never tell a lie.

Confusion and hysteria begin to overtake the room. Abigail and the girls run about screaming, claiming Mary&#x27;s spirit is attacking them in the form of a yellow bird, which nobody else is able to see. When Danforth tells the increasingly distraught Mary that he will sentence her to hang, she joins with the other girls and recants all her allegations against them, claiming John Proctor forced her to turn her against the others and that he harbors the devil. John, in despair and having given up all hope, declares that &quot;God is dead&quot;, and is arrested. Furious, Reverend Hale denounces the proceedings and quits the court.

===Act Four===
Act Four takes place three months later in the town jail, early in the morning. Tituba, sharing a cell with Sarah Good, appears to have gone insane from all of the hysteria, hearing voices and now actually claiming to talk to Satan. Marshal Herrick, depressed at having arrested so many of his neighbors, has turned to alcoholism. Many villagers have been charged with witchcraft; most have confessed and been given lengthy prison terms and their property seized by the government; twelve have been executed; seven more are to be hanged at sunrise for refusing to confess, including John Proctor, Rebecca Nurse and Martha Corey. Giles Corey was tortured to death by pressing as the court tried in vain to extract a plea; though by holding out, Giles ensured that his sons would receive his land and possessions. The village has become dysfunctional with so many people in prison or dead, and with the arrival of news of rebellion against the courts in nearby Andover, Massachusetts, whispers abound of an uprising in Salem. Abigail, fearful of the consequences, steals Parris&#x27;s life savings and boards a ship to England with Mercy Lewis.

Danforth and Hathorne have returned to Salem to meet with Parris, and are surprised to learn that Hale has returned and is meeting with the condemned. Parris, who has lost everything to Abigail, reports that he has received death threats. He begs Danforth to postpone the executions in order to secure confessions, hoping to avoid executing some of Salem&#x27;s most highly regarded citizens. Hale, deeply remorseful and blaming himself for the hysteria, has returned to counsel the condemned to falsely confess and avoid execution. He presses Danforth to pardon the remaining seven and put the entire affair behind them. Danforth refuses, stating that pardons or postponement would cast doubt on the veracity of previous confessions and hangings.

Danforth and Hale summon Elizabeth and ask her to persuade John to confess. She is bitter towards Hale, both for doubting her earlier and for wanting John to give in and ruin his good name, but agrees to speak with her husband, if only to say goodbye. She and John have a lengthy discussion, during which she commends him for holding out and not confessing. John says he is refusing to confess not out of religious conviction but through contempt for his accusers and the court. The two finally reconcile, with Elizabeth forgiving John and saddened by the thought that he cannot forgive himself and see his own goodness. Knowing in his heart that it is the wrong thing for him to do, John agrees to falsely confess to engaging in witchcraft, deciding that he has no desire or right to be a martyr.

Danforth, Hathorne, and a relieved Parris ask John to testify to the guilt of the other hold-outs and the executed. John refuses, saying he can only report on his own sins. Danforth is disappointed by this reluctance, but at the urging of Hale and Parris, allows John to sign a written confession, to be displayed on the church door as an example. John is wary, thinking his verbal confession is sufficient. As they press him further John eventually signs, but refuses to hand the paper over, stating he does not want his family and especially his three sons to be stigmatized by the public confession. The men argue until Proctor renounces his confession entirely, ripping up the signed document. Danforth calls for the sheriff and John is led away, to be hanged. Facing an imminent rebellion, Putnam and Parris frantically run out to beg Proctor to confess. Hale, guilty over John&#x27;s death, pleads with Elizabeth to talk John around but she refuses, stating John has &quot;found his goodness&quot;.

==Characters (in order of appearance)==
; Reverend Samuel Parris: The minister of Salem. A former merchant, Parris is obsessed with his reputation and frequently complains that the village does not pay him enough, earning him a great deal of scorn. When the trials begin, he is appointed as a prosecutor and helps convict the majority of those accused of witchcraft. Towards the end of the play, he is betrayed by his niece Abigail and begins receiving death threats from angry relatives of the condemned. (In real life, Parris left Salem in 1696, the year his wife, Elizabeth, died. He found his situation untenable. Records from Suffolk County, Massachusetts indicate it likely he returned to business in Boston in 1697. He preached two or three years at Stow, Massachusetts before moving to Concord, Massachusetts in 1704 or 1705. He also preached for six months in Dunstable, Massachusetts in 1711, dying on February 27, 1720, in Sudbury, Massachusetts, where he had spent his final years. In 1699 he had remarried to Dorothy Noyes in Sudbury.)
; Tituba: The Parris family slave, Tituba was brought by Parris from Barbados when he moved to Salem and has served him since. Using her knowledge of herbs and magic, she has been secretly helping Abigail and her friends make love potions, and even conducts a seance on behalf of Ann Putnam. After being framed for witchcraft, she confesses and is subsequently imprisoned with Sarah Good. By the fourth act, she has been driven mad by the harsh conditions and her ending is unknown.
; Abigail Williams: The main antagonist of the play. Abigail previously worked as a maid for Elizabeth Proctor. After Elizabeth suspected Abigail of having an illicit relationship with John Proctor, Williams was fired and disgraced. Using her status as Parris&#x27;s niece to her advantage, she accuses countless citizens of witchcraft, becoming one of the most powerful people in Salem. Eventually, she flees Salem with her uncle&#x27;s fortune rather than face the consequences of her actions.
; Susanna Walcott: A servant girl and part of Abigail&#x27;s inner circle.
; Ann Putnam: A rich and well-connected member of Salem&#x27;s elite. She has one daughter, Ruth (in real life, Ann Putnam Jr.), but has lost seven other children to illness. Believing witches to be responsible, she eagerly sides with Abigail. (In real life, Ann Putnam (née Carr) had twelve children, ten of whom survived their parents, who both died in 1699).
; Thomas Putnam: One of the richest men in Salem. He is greedy and conniving, using the accusations as cover to purchase land seized from convicted witches.
; Betty Parris: The ten-year-old daughter of Samuel Parris and one of the primary accusers.
; Mercy Lewis: Another primary accuser. In the fourth act, she flees with Abigail to avoid arrest for deceiving the court.
; Mary Warren: The Proctor family&#x27;s servant. She initially helps John, but later turns on him to save herself.
; John Proctor: The play&#x27;s protagonist and husband of Elizabeth Proctor. A local farmer, John is known for his independence and temper, which often gets him into trouble with the authorities. Contemporary notes describe him as a &quot;strong-willed beast of a man&quot;. Shamed by an affair with Abigail, John tries to stay out of the trials, but when Elizabeth is charged, he tries to reveal Abigail&#x27;s deception in court. Betrayed by his maid Mary Warren, John is accused of witchcraft and sentenced to hang. He refuses to confess out of refusal to offer false confession, but ultimately relents in order to spare his life. After learning that it would be displayed publicly, he fully withdraws his confession. He is finally hanged along with several other convicted witches.
: (The real John Proctor was also an innkeeper as well as a farmer, and was aged 60 when executed; Elizabeth was his third wife. He was strongly and vocally opposed to the witch trials from their beginning, being particularly scornful of spectral evidence used in the trials. As in the play, Elizabeth was accused of practicing witchcraft and arrested before John. Unlike the play, John maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal. He was hanged in August, 1692.)
; Giles Corey: A close friend of Proctor&#x27;s. He becomes convinced that the trials are being used to steal land from the guilty and presents evidence to prove his claim. When the court demands to know where he obtained it, he refuses to cooperate and is sentenced to be pressed to death. (The character is based on a real person of the same name, who was also pressed when he would not plead guilty to charges of witchcraft.)
; Rebecca Nurse: Although an elderly, respected member of the community, she is sentenced to death on charges of witchcraft (and, in the play, infanticide). (In real life, the jury initially acquitted Nurse but were ordered by William Stoughton to deliberate further. One of her two sisters, Mary Easty (or Eastey), was also hanged for witchcraft in real life, and the other, Sarah Cloyce, narrowly escaped.)
; Reverend John Hale: A young minister from Beverly, Massachusetts, known for his knowledge of witchcraft. He starts out as a fervent and devoted servant of the court, using his position to investigate and charge suspected witches. Disillusioned with the corruption and abuses of the trials, he later tries to save as many suspects as possible by getting them to confess. (In reality, Hale was in his mid-fifties when the witch trials commenced.)
; Elizabeth Proctor: John&#x27;s wife. She is also accused of witchcraft, but is spared the death penalty due to being pregnant. She distrusts her husband for his adultery, but eventually chooses to forgive him when he refuses to confess to false charges.
; Ezekiel Cheever: The clerk of Salem&#x27;s General Court. He is responsible for crafting the warrants used to arrest suspected witches.
; George Herrick/John Willard: Herrick is the town marshal of Salem, and leads the effort to find and arrest those accused of witchcraft until he falls into despair and turns to alcoholism. Willard is one of his deputies until he refuses to carry out any more arrests, at which point he is charged with witchcraft and hanged.
; Judge John Hathorne: One of the two judges presiding over the court. Hathorne is a deeply pious man whose blind faith in Abigail&#x27;s trustworthiness is largely responsible for the destruction wrought by the trials.
; Deputy Governor Thomas Danforth: The chief judge of the court. He views the proceedings as an opportunity to cement his power and influence, eagerly convicting anyone brought before him. His refusal to suspend the trials even as they tear Salem apart makes him, according to Miller, the true villain of the play.

== Notable casts ==

*Original 1953 Broadway cast: The production was directed by Jed Harris and produced by Kermit Bloomgarden. In June 1953 Miller recast the production, simplified the &quot;pitiless sets of rude buildings&quot; and added a scene.
* 2002 Broadway revival cast: This production was directed by Richard Eyre.
* 2016 Broadway revival cast: This production was directed by Ivo van Hove and featured an original score composed by Philip Glass.

== Originality ==
During the McCarthy era, German-Jewish novelist and playwright Lion Feuchtwanger became the target of suspicion as a left-wing intellectual during his exile in the US. In 1947, Feuchtwanger wrote a play about the Salem witch trials, &#x27; (&quot;Delusion, or The Devil in Boston&quot;), as an allegory for the persecution of communists, thus anticipating the theme of &quot;The Crucible&quot; by Arthur Miller; &#x27; premiered in Germany in 1949. It was translated by June Barrows Mussey and performed in Los Angeles in 1953 under the title &quot;The Devil in Boston&quot;.

==Historical accuracy==
In 1953, the year the play debuted, Miller wrote, &quot;&quot;The Crucible&quot; is taken from history. No character is in the play who did not take a similar role in Salem, 1692.&quot; This does not appear to be accurate as Miller made both deliberate changes and incidental mistakes. Abigail Williams&#x27; age was increased from 11 or 12 to 17, probably to add credence to the backstory of Proctor&#x27;s affair with Abigail. John Proctor himself was 60 years old in 1692, but portrayed as much younger in the play, for the same reason.

Miller claimed, in &quot;A Note on the Historical Accuracy of this Play&quot;, that &quot;while there were several judges of almost equal authority, I have symbolized them all in Hathorne and Danforth&quot;. However, this conflates Danforth with the historical and extremely influential figure of William Stoughton, who is not a character and is only briefly mentioned in the play. Both men were subsequent Deputy Governors, but it was Stoughton (who, alone among the judges, was a bachelor who never married) who ordered further deliberations after the jury initially acquitted Rebecca Nurse. He refused to ever acknowledge that the trials had been anything other than a success, and was infuriated when Governor Phips (whose own wife, somehow, had been named as a possible witch) ended the trials for good and released the prisoners.

Danforth did not sit on the Court of Oyer and Terminer. In fact he is recorded as being critical of the conduct of the trials, and played a role in bringing them to an end. In the play, Thomas and especially Ann Putnam are disconsolate over the fact that only one of their children has survived to adolescence. In real life, the Putnams (who both died in 1699) were survived by ten of their twelve children, including Ann Jr. Thomas Putnam&#x27;s conduct during the witch trial hysteria has been amply documented to have been almost entirely due to financial motivations and score-settling, something the play only makes reference to after introducing the Putnams&#x27; fictional deceased offspring as part of the plot narrative.

In the 1953 essay, &quot;Journey to &quot;The Crucible&quot;&quot;, Miller writes of visiting Salem and feeling like the only one interested in what really happened in 1692. Many of Miller&#x27;s characters were based on people who had little in the public record other than their statements from the trials, but others survived to expand, recant, or comment on the role they played at Salem, including jurors, accusers, survivors, and judges. Rev. Parris issued his first in a series of apologies on November 26, 1694, and was removed from his position in 1697. In 1698, Hale finished composing a lengthy essay about Salem that was reprinted by George Burr in 1914.

===Language of the period===
The play&#x27;s action takes place 70 years after the community arrived as settlers from Britain. The people on whom the characters are based would have retained strong regional dialects from their home country. Miller gave all his characters the same colloquialisms, such as &quot;Goody&quot; or &quot;Goodwife&quot;, and drew on the rhythms and speech patterns of the King James Bible to achieve the effect of historical perspective he wanted.

===Title===
Miller originally called the play &quot;Those Familiar Spirits&quot; before renaming it as &quot;The Crucible&quot;. The word &quot;crucible&quot; is defined as a severe test or trial; alternately, a container in which metals or other substances are subjected to high temperatures. The characters whose moral standards prevail in the face of death, such as John Proctor and Rebecca Nurse, symbolically refuse to sacrifice their principles or to falsely confess.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
* 1957 – &quot;The Crucible&quot; (also titled &quot;Hexenjagd&quot; or &quot;Les Sorcières de Salem&quot;), a joint Franco-East German film production by Belgian director Raymond Rouleau with a screenplay adapted by Jean-Paul Sartre.
* 1996 – &quot;The Crucible&quot; with a screenplay by Arthur Miller himself. The cast included Paul Scofield, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Winona Ryder. This adaptation earned Miller an Academy Award nomination for Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, his only nomination.
* 2014 – The Old Vic&#x27;s production of &quot;The Crucible&quot; which starred Richard Armitage and directed by Yaël Farber was filmed and distributed to cinemas across the UK, Ireland, and the United States.

===Stage===
The play was adapted by composer Robert Ward as an opera, &quot;The Crucible&quot;, which was first performed in 1961 and received the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for Music and the New York Music Critics&#x27; Circle Award.

William Tuckett presented a ballet at The Royal Ballet in London in 2000 to a collage of music by Charles Ives with designs by Ralph Steadman. A production by Helen Pickett for the Scottish Ballet was first performed in 2019 at the Edinburgh International Festival; its American premiere was in May 2020 at The Kennedy Center&#x27;s Eisenhower Theater in Washington, D.C.

===Television===
The play has been presented several times on television. A 1968 production starred George C. Scott as John Proctor, Colleen Dewhurst (Scott&#x27;s wife at the time) as Elizabeth Proctor, Melvyn Douglas as Thomas Danforth, and Tuesday Weld as Abigail Williams. A production by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Gielgud Theatre in London&#x27;s West End in 2006 was recorded for the Victoria and Albert Museum&#x27;s National Video Archive of Performance.

<text>Georgy Timofeyevich Dobrovolsky (; 1 June 192830 June 1971) was a Soviet cosmonaut who commanded the three-man crew of the Soyuz 11 spacecraft. They became the world&#x27;s first space station crew aboard Salyut 1, but died of asphyxiation because of an accidentally opened valve. They were the first and only humans to have died in space.

== Biography ==
Dobrovolsky, Viktor Patsayev and Vladislav Volkov flew on the Soyuz 11 mission and were the world&#x27;s third crew to die during a space flight.

After a normal re-entry, the capsule was opened and the crew was found dead. It was discovered that a valve had opened just prior to leaving orbit that had allowed the capsule&#x27;s atmosphere to vent away into space, suffocating the crew.

Dobrovolsky&#x27;s ashes were placed in an urn in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis on Red Square in Moscow. Among the pallbearers were Alexei Leonov (who had been the prime-crew commander scheduled to launch on Soyuz 11), Vladimir Shatalov, Andriyan Nikolayev, and American astronaut Thomas P. Stafford. Dobrovolsky was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, the Order of Lenin, and the title of Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR.

<text>Viktor Ivanovich Patsayev (; 19 June 193330 June 1971) was a Soviet cosmonaut who flew on the Soyuz 11 mission and was part of the third space crew to die during a space flight. On board the space station Salyut 1 he operated the Orion 1 Space Observatory (see Orion 1 and Orion 2 Space Observatories); he became the first man to operate a telescope outside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

After a normal re-entry, the capsule was opened and the crew was found dead. It was discovered that a valve had opened just prior to leaving orbit that had allowed the capsule&#x27;s atmosphere to vent away into space, suffocating the crew. One of Patsayev&#x27;s hands was found to be bruised, and he may have been trying to shut the valve manually at the time he lost consciousness.

Patsayev&#x27;s ashes were interred in the Kremlin Wall on Red Square in Moscow. He was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, the Order of Lenin and the title of Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR. The lunar crater &quot;Patsaev&quot; and the minor planet 1791 Patsayev are named for him.

<text>The  (; BnF) is the national library of France, located in Paris on two main sites, &quot;Richelieu&quot; and &quot;François-Mitterrand&quot;. It is the national repository of all that is published in France. Some of its extensive collections, including books and manuscripts but also precious objects and artworks, are on display at the BnF Museum (formerly known as the ) on the Richelieu site.

The National Library of France is a public establishment under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture. Its mission is to constitute collections, especially the copies of works published in France that must, by law, be deposited there, conserve them, and make them available to the public. It produces a reference catalogue, cooperates with other national and international establishments, as well as participates in research programs.

==History==
The National Library of France traces its origin to the royal library founded at the Louvre Palace by Charles V in 1368. Charles had received a collection of manuscripts from his predecessor, John II, and transferred them to the Louvre from the Palais de la Cité. The first librarian of record was Claude Mallet, the king&#x27;s valet de chambre, who made a sort of catalogue, &quot;Inventoire des Livres du Roy nostre Seigneur estans au Chastel du Louvre&quot;. Jean Blanchet made another list in 1380 and Jean de Bégue one in 1411 and another in 1424. Charles V was a patron of learning and encouraged the making and collection of books. It is known that he employed Nicholas Oresme, , and others to transcribe ancient texts. At the death of Charles VI, this first collection was unilaterally bought by the English regent of France, the Duke of Bedford, who transferred it to England in 1424. It was apparently dispersed at his death in 1435.

Charles VII did little to repair the loss of these books, but the invention of printing resulted in the starting of another collection in the Louvre inherited by Louis XI in 1461. Charles VIII seized a part of the collection of the kings of Aragon. Louis XII, who had inherited the library at Blois, incorporated the latter into the &quot;Bibliothèque du Roi&quot; and further enriched it with the Gruthuyse collection and with plunder from Milan. Francis I transferred the collection in 1534 to Fontainebleau and merged it with his private library. During his reign, fine bindings became the craze and many of the books added by him and Henry II are masterpieces of the binder&#x27;s art.

Under librarianship of Jacques Amyot, the collection was transferred to Paris and then relocated on several occasions, a process during which many treasures were lost. Henry IV had it moved to the Collège de Clermont in 1595, a year after the expulsion of the Jesuits from their establishment. In 1604, the Jesuits were allowed to return and the collection was moved to the Cordeliers Convent, then in 1622 to the nearby on the rue de la Harpe. The appointment of Jacques Auguste de Thou as librarian initiated a period of development that made it the largest and richest collection of books in the world. He was succeeded by his son who was replaced, when executed for treason, by Jérôme Bignon, the first of a line of librarians of the same name. Under de Thou, the library was enriched by the collections of Queen Catherine de Medici. The library grew rapidly during the reigns of Louis XIII and Louis XIV, due in great part to the interest of Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, himself a dedicated collector of books.

The site in the Rue de la Harpe becoming inadequate, the library was again moved, in 1666, to two adjacent houses in Rue Vivienne. After Colbert, Louis XIV&#x27;s minister Louvois also took interest in the library and employed Jean Mabillon, Melchisédech Thévenot, and others to procure books from every source. In 1688, a catalogue in eight volumes was compiled. Louvois considered the erection of an opulent building to host it on what would become the Place Vendôme, a project that was however left unexecuted following the minister&#x27;s death in 1691.
The library opened to the public in 1692, under the administration of Abbott Camille le Tellier de Louvois, the minister&#x27;s son. The Abbé Louvois was succeeded by Jean-Paul Bignon, who in 1721 seized the opportunity of the collapse of John Law&#x27;s Mississippi Company. The company had been relocated by Law into the former palace of Cardinal Mazarin around Hôtel Tubeuf, and its failure freed significant space in which the Library would expand (even though the Hotel Tubeuf itself would remain occupied by French East India Company and later by France&#x27;s financial bureaucracy until the 1820s). Bignon also instituted a complete reform of the library&#x27;s system. Catalogues were made which appeared from 1739 to 1753 in 11 volumes. The collections increased steadily by purchase and gift to the outbreak of the French Revolution, at which time it was in grave danger of partial or total destruction, but owing to the activities of Antoine-Augustin Renouard and Joseph Van Praet it suffered no injury.

The library&#x27;s collections swelled to over 300,000 volumes during the radical phase of the French Revolution when the private libraries of aristocrats and clergy were seized. After the establishment of the French First Republic in September 1792, &quot;the Assembly declared the &quot;Bibliothèque du Roi&quot; to be national property and the institution was renamed the &quot;Bibliothèque Nationale&quot;. After four centuries of control by the Crown, this great library now became the property of the French people.&quot;
A new administrative organization was established. Napoleon took great interest in the library and among other things issued an order that all books in provincial libraries not possessed by the &quot;Bibliothèque Nationale&quot; should be forwarded to it, subject to replacement by exchanges of equal value from the duplicate collections, making it possible, as Napoleon said, to find a copy of any book in France in the National Library. Napoleon furthermore increased the collections by spoil from his conquests. A considerable number of these books were restored after his downfall. During the period from 1800 to 1836, the library was virtually under the control of Joseph Van Praet. At his death it contained more than 650,000 printed books and some 80,000 manuscripts.

Following a series of regime changes in France, it became the Imperial National Library and in 1868 was moved to newly constructed buildings on the Rue de Richelieu designed by Henri Labrouste. Upon Labrouste&#x27;s death in 1875 the library was further expanded, including the grand staircase and the Oval Room, by academic architect Jean-Louis Pascal. In 1896, the library was still the largest repository of books in the world, although it has since been surpassed by other libraries for that title. By 1920, the library&#x27;s collection had grown to 4,050,000 volumes and 11,000 manuscripts.

In 2024, the library removed four 19th-century books from its public access, namely two volumes of &quot;The Ballads of Ireland&quot; published in 1855, a bilingual anthology of Romanian poetry dating from 1856, and book of the Royal Horticultural Society published between 1862 and 1863, after tests indicated that their covers and bindings were coloured using green pigments containing arsenic.

==Richelieu site==

The Richelieu site occupies a full city block in Paris, surrounded by rue de Richelieu (west), rue des Petits-Champs (south), (east), and (north). There are two entrances, respectively on 58, rue de Richelieu and 5, rue Vivienne. This site was the main location of the library for 275 years, from 1721 to 1996. It now hosts the BnF Museum as well as facilities of the BnF, the library of the Institut National d&#x27;Histoire de l&#x27;Art (in the since 2016), and the library of the École Nationale des Chartes. It was comprehensively renovated in the 2010s and early 2020s on a design by architects and Virginie Brégal.

==François-Mitterrand site==
On 14 July 1988, President François Mitterrand announced &quot;the construction and the expansion of one of the largest and most modern libraries in the world, intended to cover all fields of knowledge, and designed to be accessible to all, using the most modern data transfer technologies, which could be consulted from a distance, and which would collaborate with other European libraries&quot;. Due to initial trade union opposition, a wireless network was fully installed only in August 2016.

In July 1989, the services of the architectural firm of Dominique Perrault were retained. The design was recognized with the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture in 1996. The construction was carried out by Bouygues. Construction of the library ran into huge cost overruns and technical difficulties related to its high-rise design, so much so that it was referred to as the &quot;TGB&quot; or &quot;Très Grande Bibliothèque&quot; (, a sarcastic allusion to the successful TGV high-speed rail system). After the move of the major collections from the Rue de Richelieu, the National Library of France was inaugurated on 15 December 1996.

, the BnF contains roughly 14 million books at its four Parisian sites (Bibliothèque François-Mitterrand, Richelieu, Arsenal, and Opéra) as well as printed documents, manuscripts, prints, photographs, maps and plans, scores, coins, medals, sound documents, video and multimedia documents, and scenery elements. The library retains the use of the Rue de Richelieu complex for some of its collections.

==Manuscript collection==

The Manuscripts department houses the largest collection of medieval and modern manuscripts worldwide.
The collection includes medieval chansons de geste and chivalric romances, eastern literature, eastern and western religions, ancient history, scientific history, and literary manuscripts by Pascal, Diderot, Apollinaire, Proust, Colette, Sartre, etc. 
The collection is organised:
* according to language (Ancient Greek, Latin, French and other European languages, Arabic, Coptic, Ethiopian, Hebrew, Persian, Turkish, Near- and Middle-Eastern languages, Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan, Sanskrit, Tamil, Indian languages, Vietnamese, etc.)
**The library holds about 5,000 Ancient Greek manuscripts, which are divided into three &quot;fonds&quot;: &quot;Ancien fonds grec&quot;, &quot;fonds Coislin&quot;, and &quot;Fonds du Supplément grec&quot;.
* according to content: learned and bibliophilic, collections of learned materials, Library Archives, genealogical collections, French provinces, Masonic collection, etc.

==Digital library==
Gallica is the digital library for online users of the and its partners. It was established in October 1997. Today it has more than six million digitized materials of various types: books, magazines, newspapers, photographs, cartoons, drawings, prints, posters, maps, manuscripts, antique coins, scores, theater costumes and sets, audio and video materials. All library materials are freely available.

On 10 February 2010, a digitized copy of &quot;Scenes of Bohemian Life&quot; by Henri Murger (1913) became Gallica&#x27;s millionth document. In February 2019, the five millionth document was a copy of the manuscript &quot;Record of an Unsuccessful Trip to the West Indies&quot; stored in the Bibliothèque Inguimbertine and on 30 March 2023 the ten millionth document was added.

, Gallica had made available online approximately 10 million documents :

* 864,428 books
* 186,495 manuscripts
* 5,804,801 newspapers and magazines issues
* 1,792,736 images
* 196,486 maps
* 64,967 music scores
* 52,004 audio recordings
* 519,877 objects
* 5,585 video recordings
Most of Gallica&#x27;s collections of texts have been converted into text format using optical character recognition (OCR-processing), which allows full-text search in the library materials.

Each document has a digital identifier, the so-called ARK (Archival Resource Key) of the National Library of France and is accompanied by a bibliographic description.

<text>The Man with Two Brains is a 1983 American science fiction black comedy film directed by Carl Reiner and starring Steve Martin and Kathleen Turner.

Written by Reiner, Martin, and George Gipe (who previously worked together on 1982&#x27;s &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot;) and shot in summer 1982 at Laird International Studios in Culver City, California, the film is a broad comedy, with Martin starring as Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr, a pioneering neurosurgeon with a cruel and unfaithful new wife, Dolores Benedict (Turner).

== Plot ==
Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr, a widowed brain surgeon, is renowned for inventing a method of &quot;cranial screw-top&quot; brain surgery. He saves the life of Dolores Benedict, a gold-digging femme fatale who is accidentally run over by Michael when fleeing the scene of her latest husband&#x27;s fatal coronary, caused by her malicious mind-games and scheming. As she recovers, Michael falls in love and they marry. Dolores torments Michael by pretending to be too ill to consummate the marriage. On a honeymoon and business trip to a medical conference in Vienna, a city living in fear of the serial &quot;Elevator Killer&quot;, Hfuhruhurr meets mad scientist Dr. Alfred Necessiter, who has created a technique enabling him to store living brains in liquid-filled jars using the Elevator Killer&#x27;s victims.

Michael discovers he can communicate telepathically with one of Necessiter&#x27;s brains, that of Anne Uumellmahaye, when they both sing &quot;Under the Bamboo Tree&quot;. Michael and Anne fall in love, with Michael taking her brain away to spend more time with her. Dolores—having learned that Michael has received a large inheritance—attempts to reignite their relationship, but catches on to his relationship with Anne when she spots him in a rowboat with the jar. She attempts to kill Anne first by leaving her out in the sun, then by putting her brain in an oven.

Michael consults with Necessiter, who informs him that brains in tanks do not survive long, with Anne being his longest-living one to date. Necessiter recommends transplanting Anne&#x27;s brain into a body of a recently deceased woman. Filling a syringe with window cleaner, the substance used by the Elevator Killer, Michael sees a crowd gathering around an attractive woman hit by a car. Michael is hoping she will expire, only to see her regain consciousness. He then targets Fran, a prostitute, but his conscience stops him. Stepping into an elevator, he finds that Dolores has just been murdered by the Elevator Killer, who turns out to be Merv Griffin. Michael takes Dolores&#x27; corpse, and Griffin promises to turn himself in to the police.

Michael takes Dolores&#x27;s body to Necessiter&#x27;s lab. He is stopped by the Austrian police, who suspect him of drunk driving. After a series of unusual sobriety tests, Michael convinces the police of his sobriety. However, as Dolores&#x27; body flails, the police realize that she was not drunk but dead and pursue his car. Michael makes it to the lab, where Necessiter transfers Anne&#x27;s consciousness to Dolores&#x27;s body, which is viewed by the stunned policemen. In the process, Michael is electrically shocked by the equipment and falls into a coma.

Waking up six weeks later, Michael meets Anne in Dolores&#x27;s body. Anne is a compulsive eater and has gained considerable weight in her new body. Michael loves Anne for who she is, and they get married. A note in the credits reports that Merv Griffin did not turn himself in as promised and requests that the audience report the whereabouts of Griffin if they see him.

===Filming===
Kathleen Turner describes the scene from this film in which her character &quot;is about to have her ass rubbed&quot; as the only sex scene of her career for which she used a body double.

== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 80% based on reviews from 25 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states &quot;As spastically uneven as its zany title suggests, &quot;The Man with Two Brains&quot; isn&#x27;t peak Steve Martin — but it&#x27;s still often close enough to enjoy.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 61 out of 100 based on 9 critic reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, and wrote that despite the fact that he &quot;never found Steve Martin irresistibly funny&quot; ... &quot;it&#x27;s a tribute to &quot;The Man With Two Brains&quot; that I found myself laughing a fair amount of the time, despite my feelings about Martin.&quot;

<doc id="199506" wikidata="Q2470471" url="?curid=199506" title="USS New Orleans (CL-22)">
<text>USS &quot;New Orleans&quot; (later designated PG-34 then CL-22) was a United States Navy protected cruiser of the &quot;New Orleans&quot; class.

She was laid down in 1895 as &quot;Amazonas&quot; for the Brazilian Navy by Armstrong, Mitchell and Company, Newcastle upon Tyne, England, launched on 4 December 1896, purchased by the U.S. Navy while building on 16 March 1898; and commissioned 18 March 1898 at Gravesend, England.

==Service history==
&quot;New Orleans&quot; sailed on 27 March 1898 to fit out at New York, New York, for service in the Spanish–American War. She left Norfolk, Virginia, on 17 May and joined the Flying Squadron off Santiago de Cuba on 30 May. The next afternoon, with &quot;Massachusetts&quot; (BB-2) and &quot;Iowa&quot; (BB-4), she reconnoitered the harbor, exchanging fire with Spanish ships and shore batteries. After joining in the bombardment of the batteries at the entrance to the harbor 6 and 16 June, &quot;New Orleans&quot; sailed to coal at Key West, and was thus absent during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba on 3 July.

Through the summer, &quot;New Orleans&quot; cruised on blockade between San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, burning the beached Spanish steamer Antonio Lopez near the coast of Puerto Rico on 16 July, and capturing the French blockade runner &quot;Olinde Rodrigues&quot; on 17 July. She arrived at Philadelphia, on 20 October for the Peace Jubilee, then prepared at New York to launch her peacetime service with a visit to New Orleans, from 16 May through 29 May 1899. After summer exercises off the Atlantic seaboard, she sailed from New York on 21 October to join the Asiatic Fleet. She called at the Azores and Port Said, passed through the Suez Canal, and reached Manila on 21 December. For the next 5 years, as flagship of the Cruiser Squadron, U.S. Asiatic Fleet, she cruised the Philippines and the China coast. Relieved by &quot;Baltimore&quot; (C-3), she departed Cavite on 27 December 1904 for Mare Island Navy Yard, arriving there on 27 January 1905 to decommission on 6 February 1905.

Recommissioning on 15 November 1909, &quot;New Orleans&quot; returned to Asiatic duty at Yokohama on 25 April 1910. She cruised the Orient until returning to Bremerton, Washington, on 14 February 1912 and going into reserve. Again in full commission on 31 December 1913, &quot;New Orleans&quot; patrolled the west coast of Mexico during the tense spring of 1914. &quot;New Orleans&quot; observed the Topolobampo naval campaign in the Gulf of California during the Mexican Revolution; she was present at the Second, Third, and Fourth Battle of Topolobampo, the final naval action of the campaign. After the Topolobampo campaign, &quot;New Orleans&quot; trained the Washington Naval Militia through the summer of 1914, returning to Mexican waters in the fall. Upon American entry into World War I, she was overhauled at Puget Sound, and sailed for the Panama Canal and the East Coast, arriving at Hampton Roads on 27 August 1917.

&quot;New Orleans&quot; escorted convoys from New York City to ocean rendezvous with destroyer escorts off the British Isles and the French coast until 16 January 1918, when she cleared New York for the Asiatic Station. She reached Yokohama from Honolulu and Panama on 13 March, cruised to China, and the Philippines, and from 17 July to 20 December 1919 was station ship at Vladivostok, Russia, supporting the Allied force in Siberia.

After repairs at Cavite, &quot;New Orleans&quot; returned to Vladivostok to resume her service for the Allied Expeditionary Force from 20 May to 27 September 1920. During further cruising with the Asiatic Fleet she was redesignated CL-22 on 8 August 1921, then completed her service at Vladivostok 14 February to 17 August 1922. She returned to Mare Island on 23 September, decommissioned there on 16 November 1922, and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 November 1929. On 1 April 1925 the 4.7-inch gun No. 5 was presented to Kane County, Illinois by the U.S. government and is currently on display at the Kane County courthouse in Geneva Illinois. She was sold for scrapping on 11 February 1930.

==Armament==

&quot;New Orleans&quot; was originally armed with six 6&quot;/50 caliber (152 mm) guns and four 4.7&quot;/50 caliber (120 mm) guns. These were British-made export-model guns built by Elswick Ordnance Company, a subsidiary of Armstrong. These guns were unique in the US Navy to &quot;New Orleans&quot; and her sister , and they were designated as &quot;6&quot;/50 caliber Mark 5 Armstrong guns&quot; and &quot;4.7&quot;/50 caliber Mark 3 Armstrong guns&quot;. To reduce supply difficulties, during refits at the Cavite Navy Yard in the Philippines in 1903, both ships had their 4.7-inch guns replaced with standard /50 caliber Mark 5 guns; the 6-inch guns were replaced with 5-inch guns in 1907. Their torpedo tubes were also removed in the 1903 refits. At least some of the guns from these ships were emplaced in the Grande Island/Subic Bay area 1907-1910 and operated by the United States Marine Corps until the Coast Artillery Corps&#x27; modern defenses centered on Fort Wint were completed. During World War I the 5-inch guns were reduced from ten to eight and a 3&quot;/50 caliber (76 mm) anti-aircraft gun was added. Two 4.7-inch guns (one from each ship of the class) are preserved at the Kane County, Illinois Soldier and Sailor Monument at the former courthouse in Geneva, Illinois.

Donald was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1964. He attended West Jesmond Infant School 1969–1973, West Jesmond Junior School 1973–1975, Heaton Secondary School (comprehensive) 1975–1980, and Newcastle College of Arts &amp; Technology 1981–1983.

In 1976 Donald joined Newcastle’s People’s Theatre, training in theatre skills. He acted in several of the theatre’s Young People’s Theatre productions. He worked as assistant stage manager for the Royal Shakespeare Company on their People&#x27;s Theatre visit in 1977. He also performed at the Gulbenkian Theatre. He left the People&#x27;s Theatre in 1980.

Between 1981 and 1983, Donald acted as singer and lyricist for comedy rock band Johnny Shiloe’s Movement Machine. The band comprised Dave Rose (composition and drums), Paul Rose (guitar) and Gary Shaw (bass).

In 1981, Donald appeared in an episode of BBC Two’s &quot;Something Else&quot; programme. In 1983 he co-wrote and appeared in an episode &quot;Sparks&quot;, also on BBC Two.

He specialised as an antagonist on Carlton Television&#x27;s live debate programmes in the early 1990s, and moved on to play important roles in the BBC’s &quot;I Love&quot; series and Channel 4’s &quot;100 Greatest&quot;.

In 2004, he presented &quot;The Regionnaires&quot;, a six-part north-east regional panel show broadcast on ITV Tyne Tees, which he co-wrote with his former &quot;Viz&quot; partner Alex Collier.

In 2005, he met Hungover Stuntmen and in 2006 joined their management team. He became their sole manager in 2007. The band recorded an album in Ibiza, played the Ibiza Rocks festival two years running and appeared at Newcastle Arena with Paul Weller. His work with the band stopped when Simon became full-time carer for his eldest brother Steve, who was diagnosed with cancer in the summer of 2008 and died the following November.

==Stand-up comedy==
In 2005, Donald started performing stand-up comedy, initially working the circuit in Tyne and Wear, where he compèred both The Horse’s Mouth in Newcastle and Mack’em Laugh in Sunderland. After taking a break to care for his terminally ill brother, Donald returned to stand-up comedy, beginning to appear on stage as the characters he had previously talked about in his routine. He soon picked up representation by Off the Kerb, one of the largest producers and managers of comedy in the United Kingdom.

In the summer of 2009, Donald moved to London to work the city&#x27;s comedy circuit. He continued to perform around the United Kingdom, including runs at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2009 and 2010. He performed his Sold Out solo show in Newcastle. In 2012–13, he hosted spoof-panel show &quot;Fuckwits&quot; at The Stand Comedy Club in Newcastle.

<text>Kadyny is a village of Gmina Tolkmicko, within Elbląg County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland.

==Geography==

It is situated in the Elbląg Upland Landscape Park, a protected area on a terminal moraine stretching along the Vistula Lagoon of the Baltic Coast. The Bażyński Oak in the village is one of the oldest trees in Poland.

Kadyny lies approximately south-west of Tolkmicko, north of Elbląg, and north-west of the regional capital Olsztyn. It shares a border with the village of Łęcze to the south. 
Kadyny Station is a stop on the former Vistula Lagoon railway line (&quot;Kolej Nadzalewowa&quot;) from Elbląg to Braniewo, which is to be re-activated by the private Arriva RP rail carrier. The settlements Kikoły and Ostrogóra are both considered part of Kadyny.

==History==

In the 11th-13th century a Baltic Prussian stronghold was located at the Klasztorna Góra (&quot;Monastery Hill&quot;). The &quot;terra Cadinensis&quot; in Prussia was first mentioned in a 1255 deed. It was allegedly named after Cadina, a daughter of an Old Prussian chief. Actually Old Prussian &quot;kudas&quot; means &quot;hardship&quot; or &quot;wilderness&quot;. Named &quot;Kudien&quot; in 1354, the Teutonic Knights of the Elbing commandry had built a &quot;Vorwerk&quot; estate near the site of a former Prussian fortress, where they held court over the native Pogesanian inhabitants in the area. From 1431 the Kadyny (&quot;Cadinen&quot;) manor was owned by Jan Bażyński, leader and co-founder of the Prussian Confederation, upon the request of which Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the region to the Kingdom of Poland in 1454, and then Polish governor of the region, who fought on the Polish side during the subsequent Polish–Teutonic Thirteen Years&#x27; War. The over 700-years old Bażyński Oak, a natural monument, in Kadyny is named after Jan Bażyński.

The Teutonic Knights recognized the region as part of Poland in the 1466 Second Peace of Thorn, and afterwards it was administratively located in the Malbork Voivodeship in the province of Royal Prussia in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. The Bażyński family sold Kadyny in 1605 to the city of Elbląg. In 1682 it was owned by Polish voivode of Inflanty, Jan Teodor Schlieben, and after 1695 his son sold the village to Stanisław Działyński. Jan Teodor Schlieben founded a Bernardine monastery, and in 1685 brought monks from Warsaw to Kadyny, and he also erected a palace in the late 18th century, which was rebuilt in the 1730s by Jan Ignacy Działyński. A new monastery was built in the 1740s.

The village was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the First Partition of Poland in 1772, and in 1773 it was incorporated into the newly formed province of West Prussia, and the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Danzig from 1815, and from 1871 it was also part of Germany. The Prussians closed and liquidated the abbey, and the monastery fell into neglect in the following decades. The German emperor Wilhelm II acquired the local palace in 1898 and had it rebuilt as his summer residence. A successful Maiolica tile factory was established there in 1905, and many of those tiles were used to decorate the Old Elbe Tunnel in Hamburg and several Berlin U-Bahn stations. Wilhelm also had a breeding site for Trakehner horses established and the village developed as a fashionable seaside resort. After World War I and the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, Cadinen remained part of the German Province of East Prussia and a property of the House of Hohenzollern until their expulsion in 1945. Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia (1907–1994), who lived there during World War II, was the last Hohenzollern to reside here.

After Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, in 1945, the area was turned over to the Republic of Poland under the Potsdam Agreement, and renamed to its historic Polish name Kadyny. Today the estates are managed as a cultural heritage site and popular tourist destination.

== Notable people ==
Princess Marie Cécile of Prussia (born 1942) and Princess Kira of Prussia (1943–2004), daughters of Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia and his wife Grand Duchess Kira Kirillovna of Russia (1909–1967) were born in Cadinen.

<doc id="199511" wikidata="Q294555" url="?curid=199511" title="Paul Tibbets">
<text>Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr. (23 February 1915 – 1 November 2007) was a brigadier general in the United States Air Force. He is best known as the aircraft captain who flew the B-29 Superfortress known as the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; (named after his mother) when it dropped a Little Boy, the first of two atomic bombs used in warfare, on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.

Tibbets enlisted in the United States Army in 1937 and qualified as a pilot in 1938. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he flew anti-submarine patrols over the Atlantic. In February 1942, he became the commanding officer of the 340th Bombardment Squadron of the 97th Bombardment Group, which was equipped with the Boeing B-17. In July 1942, the 97th became the first heavy bombardment group to be deployed as part of the Eighth Air Force, and Tibbets became deputy group commander. He flew the lead plane in the first American daylight heavy bomber mission against German-occupied Europe on 17 August 1942, and the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe on 9 October 1942. Tibbets was chosen to fly Major General Mark W. Clark and Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower to Gibraltar. After flying 43 combat missions, he became the assistant for bomber operations on the staff of the Twelfth Air Force.

Tibbets returned to the United States in February 1943 to help with the development of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. In September 1944, he was appointed the commander of the 509th Composite Group, which would conduct the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After the war, he participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear weapon tests at Bikini Atoll in mid-1946, and was involved in the development of the Boeing B-47 Stratojet in the early 1950s. He commanded the 308th Bombardment Wing and 6th Air Division in the late 1950s, and was military attaché in India from 1964 to 1966. After leaving the Air Force in 1966, he worked for Executive Jet Aviation, serving on the founding board and as its president from 1976 until his retirement in 1987.

After the war he received wide publicity, including motion picture portrayals, and became a symbolic figure in the debate over the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.

== Early life ==
Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr. was born in Quincy, Illinois, on 23 February 1915, the son of Paul Warfield Tibbets Sr. and his wife, Enola Gay Tibbets. When he was five years old, the family moved to Davenport, Iowa, and then to Iowa&#x27;s capital, Des Moines, where he was raised, and where his father became a confections wholesaler. When he was eight, his family moved to Hialeah, Florida, to escape from harsh midwestern winters. As a boy, he was very interested in flying. One day, his mother agreed to pay one dollar to get him into an airplane at the local carnival. In 1927, when he was 12 years old, he flew in a plane piloted by barnstormer Doug Davis, dropping candy bars with tiny parachutes to the crowd of people attending the races at the Hialeah Park Race Track.

In the late 1920s, business issues forced Tibbets&#x27;s family to return to Alton, Illinois, where he graduated from Western Military Academy in 1933. He then attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, and became an initiated member of the Epsilon Zeta chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity in 1934. During that time, Tibbets took private flying lessons at Miami&#x27;s Opa-locka Airport with Rusty Heard, who later became a captain at Eastern Airlines. After his undergraduate work, Tibbets had planned on becoming an abdominal surgeon. He transferred to the University of Cincinnati after his second year to complete his pre-med studies there, because the University of Florida had no medical school at the time. However, he attended for only a year and a half as he changed his mind about wanting to become a doctor. Instead, he decided to enlist in the United States Army and become a pilot in the United States Army Air Corps.

== Early military career ==
Because he went to a military school, attended some college, and had some flight experience, Tibbets qualified for the Aviation Cadet Training Program. On 25 February 1937, he enlisted in the army at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, and was sent to Randolph Field in San Antonio, Texas, for primary and basic flight instruction. During his training, he showed himself to be an above-average pilot. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and received his pilot rating in 1938 at Kelly Field in San Antonio.

After graduation, Tibbets was assigned to the 16th Observation Squadron, which was based at Lawson Field, Georgia, with a flight supporting the Infantry School at nearby Fort Benning. It was at Fort Benning that Tibbets met Lucy Frances Wingate, then a clerk at a department store in Columbus, Georgia. The two quietly married in a Roman Catholic seminary in Holy Trinity, Alabama, on 19 June 1938 even though Tibbets was a Protestant. Tibbets did not inform his family or his commanding officer, and the couple arranged for the notice to be kept out of the local newspaper. They had two sons. Paul III was born in 1940, in Columbus, Georgia, and graduated from Huntingdon College and Auburn University. He was a colonel in the United States Army Reserve and worked as a hospital pharmacist. He died in West Monroe, Louisiana, in 2016. The younger son, Gene Wingate Tibbets, was born in 1944, and was at the time of his death in 2012 residing in Georgiana in Butler County in southern Alabama.

While Tibbets was stationed at Fort Benning, he was promoted to first lieutenant and served as a personal pilot for Brigadier General George S. Patton, Jr., in 1940 and 1941. In June 1941, Tibbets transferred to the 9th Bombardment Squadron of the 3d Bombardment Group at Hunter Field, Savannah, Georgia, as the engineering officer, and flew the A-20 Havoc. While there he was promoted to captain. In December 1941, he received orders to join the 29th Bombardment Group at MacDill Field, Florida, for training on the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. On 7 December 1941, Tibbets heard about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor while listening to the radio during a routine flight. Due to fears that German U-boats might enter Tampa Bay and bombard MacDill Field, the 29th Bombardment Group moved to Savannah. Tibbets remained on temporary duty with the 3d Bombardment Group, forming an anti-submarine patrol at Pope Army Airfield, North Carolina, with 21 B-18 Bolo medium bombers. The B-18s were used as an intermediate trainer, which pilots flew after basic flight training in a Cessna UC-78 and before qualifying in the B-17.

== War against Germany ==

In February 1942, Tibbets reported for duty with the 29th Bombardment Group as its engineering officer. Three weeks later he was named the commanding officer of the 340th Bombardment Squadron of the 97th Bombardment Group, equipped with the B-17D. It was initially based at MacDill, and then Sarasota Army Airfield, Florida, before moving to Godfrey Army Airfield in Bangor, Maine.

In July 1942 the 97th became the first heavy bombardment group of the Eighth Air Force to be deployed to England, where it was based at RAF Polebrook. It had been hastily assembled to meet demands for an early deployment, and arrived without any training in the basics of high altitude daylight bombing. In the first weeks of August 1942, under the tutelage of Royal Air Force veterans, the group received intensive training for its first mission. The group commander, Lieutenant Colonel Cornelius W. Cousland, was replaced by Colonel Frank A. Armstrong Jr., who appointed Tibbets as his deputy.

Tibbets flew the lead bomber &quot;Butcher Shop&quot; for the first American daylight heavy bomber mission on 17 August 1942, a shallow-penetration raid against a marshalling yard in Rouen in Occupied France, with Armstrong as his co-pilot. This was not Tibbets&#x27;s regular aircraft, &quot;Red Gremlin&quot;, nor his regular crew, which included bombardier Thomas Ferebee and navigator Theodore Van Kirk, who later flew with him in &quot;Enola Gay&quot;. On 9 October 1942, Tibbets led the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe, attacking industrial targets in the French city of Lille. Poor bombing accuracy resulted in numerous civilian casualties and less damage to the rail installations than hoped, but the mission was hailed an overall success because it reached its target against heavy and constant fighter attack. Of the 108 aircraft in the raid, 33 were shot down or had to turn back due to mechanical problems.

On that first mission, Tibbets saw in real time that his bombs were falling on innocent civilians. At the time, he thought to himself, &quot;People are getting killed down there that don&#x27;t have any business getting killed. Those are not soldiers&quot;. But then he thought back to a lesson he had learned during his time at medical school from his roommate who was a doctor. This doctor explained to him about his former classmates who failed the program and ended up in drug sales. The reason why they had failed the program was because &quot;they had too much sympathy for their patients&quot;, which &quot;destroyed their ability to render the medical necessities&quot;. It dawned on Tibbets that:

In the leadup to Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, the commander of the Eighth Air Force, Major General Carl Spaatz was ordered to provide his best two pilots for a secret mission. He chose Tibbets and Major Wayne Connors. Tibbets flew Major General Mark W. Clark from Polebrook to Gibraltar while Connors flew Clark&#x27;s chief of staff, Brigadier General Lyman Lemnitzer. A few weeks later Tibbets flew the Supreme Allied Commander, Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower, there. &quot;By reputation&quot;, historian Stephen Ambrose wrote, Tibbets was &quot;the best flier in the Army Air Force&quot;.

Tibbets had flown 25 combat missions against targets in France when the 97th Bomb Group was transferred to North Africa as part of Major General Jimmy Doolittle&#x27;s Twelfth Air Force. For Tibbets, the war in North Africa introduced him to the realities of aerial warfare. He said that he saw the real effects of bombing civilians and the trauma of losing his brothers in arms. In January 1943, Tibbets, who had now flown 43 combat missions, was assigned as the assistant for bomber operations to Colonel Lauris Norstad, Assistant Chief of Staff of Operations (A-3) of the Twelfth Air Force. Tibbets had recently been given a battlefield promotion to colonel, but did not receive it, as such promotions had to be confirmed by a panel of officers. He was told that Norstad had vetoed the promotion, saying &quot;there&#x27;s only going to be one colonel in operations&quot;.

Tibbets did not get along well with Norstad, or with Doolittle&#x27;s chief of staff, Brigadier General Hoyt Vandenberg. In one planning meeting, Norstad wanted an all-out raid on Bizerte to be flown at . Tibbets protested that flak would be most effective at that altitude. When challenged by Norstad, Tibbets said he would lead the mission himself at 6,000 feet if Norstad would fly as his co-pilot. Norstad backed down, and the mission was successfully flown at .

== War against Japan ==
When General Henry H. &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold, the Chief of United States Army Air Forces, requested an experienced bombardment pilot to help with the development of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, Doolittle recommended Tibbets. Tibbets returned to the United States in February 1943. At the time, the B-29 program was beset by a host of technical problems, and the chief test pilot, Edmund T. Allen, had been killed in a crash of the prototype aircraft.
Working with the Boeing plant in Wichita, Kansas, Tibbets test-flew the B-29 and soon accumulated more flight time in it than any other pilot. He found that without defensive armament and armor plating, the aircraft was lighter, and its performance was much improved. In simulated combat engagements against a P-47 fighter at the B-29&#x27;s cruising altitude of , he discovered that the B-29 had a smaller turning radius than the P-47, and could avoid it by turning away.

After a year of developmental testing of the B-29, Tibbets was assigned in March 1944 as director of operations of the 17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Very Heavy), a B-29 training unit based at Grand Island Army Air Field, Nebraska, and commanded by Armstrong. Its role was to transition pilots to the B-29. Crews were reluctant to embrace the troublesome B-29, and to shame the male crews, Tibbets taught and certified two Women Airforce Service Pilots, Dora Dougherty and Dorothea (Didi) Johnson Moorman, to fly the B-29 as demonstration pilots, and the crews&#x27; attitude changed.
On 1 September 1944, Tibbets reported to Colorado Springs Army Airfield, the headquarters of the Second Air Force, where he met with its commander, Major General Uzal Ent, and three representatives of the Manhattan Project, Lieutenant Colonel John Lansdale Jr., Captain William S. Parsons, and Norman F. Ramsey Jr., who briefed him on the project. Tibbets was told that he would be in charge of the 509th Composite Group, a fully self-contained organization of about 1,800 men, which would have 15 B-29s and a high priority for all kinds of military stores. Ent gave Tibbets a choice of three possible bases: Great Bend Army Airfield, Kansas; Mountain Home Army Airfield, Idaho; or Wendover Army Air Field, Utah. Tibbets selected Wendover for its remoteness.

When the operation was still in its development stages, Armstrong and Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson were the leading candidates to command the group who was designated to drop the atomic bomb. Wilson was the Army Air Force project officer who provided liaison support to the Manhattan Project. Armstrong was an experienced combat veteran against German targets, but he was in his forties and had been severely injured in a fire in the summer of 1943. Wilson had no combat experience and was qualified primarily because of his engineering background and association with the project. Tibbets was considerably younger than both men and had experience in both staff and command duties in heavy bomber combat operations. He was already an experienced B-29 pilot, which made him an ideal candidate for the top-secret project. Tibbets indicated that the decision on what aircraft to use to deliver the bomb was left to him.
Tibbets was promoted to colonel in January 1945 and brought his wife and family along with him to Wendover. He felt that allowing married men in the group to bring their families would improve morale, although it put a strain on his own marriage. In order to disguise all the civilian engineers on base who were working on the Manhattan Project, Tibbets was forced to lie to his wife; he told her that the engineers were &quot;sanitary workers&quot;. At one point, Tibbets found that Lucy had co-opted a scientist to unplug a drain. During a meeting with these &quot;sanitary engineers&quot;, Tibbets was told by Robert Oppenheimer that his aircraft might not survive the shock waves from an atomic bomb explosion.

On 6 March 1945 (concurrent with the activation of Project Alberta), the 1st Ordnance Squadron, Special (Aviation) was activated at Wendover, again using Army Air Forces personnel on hand or already at Los Alamos. Its purpose was to provide &quot;skilled machinists, welders and munitions workers&quot; and special equipment to the group to enable it to assemble atomic weapons at its operating base, thereby allowing the weapons to be transported more safely in their component parts. A rigorous candidate selection process was used to recruit personnel, reportedly with an 80% rejection rate. The 509th Composite Group reached full strength in May 1945.

With the addition of the 1st Ordnance Squadron to its roster in March 1945, the 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom deployed to Tinian, an island in the northern Marianas within striking distance of Japan, in May and June 1945. The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron kept its base of operations at Wendover. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian all 51 civilian and military personnel of Project Alberta. Furthermore, two representatives from Washington, D.C. were present on the island: the deputy director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Thomas Farrell, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell of the Military Policy Committee.

The ground support echelon of the 509th Composite Group received movement orders and moved by rail on 26 April 1945, to its port of embarkation at Seattle, Washington. On 6 May the support elements sailed on the SS &quot;Cape Victory&quot; for the Marianas, while the group&#x27;s materiel was shipped on the SS &quot;Emile Berliner&quot;. An advance party of the air echelon flew by C-54 to North Field, Tinian, between 15 and 22 May, where it was joined by the ground echelon on 29 May 1945. Project Alberta&#x27;s &quot;Destination Team&quot; also sent most of its members to Tinian to supervise the assembly, loading, and dropping of the bombs under the administrative title of 1st Technical Services Detachment, Miscellaneous War Department Group.
On 5 August 1945, Tibbets formally named his B-29 &quot;Enola Gay&quot; after his mother. &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, serial number 4486292, had been personally selected by him, on recommendation of a civilian production supervisor, while it was still on the assembly line at the Glenn L. Martin Company plant in Bellevue, Nebraska. The regularly assigned aircraft commander, Robert A. Lewis, was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious when he arrived at the airfield on the morning of 6 August to see the aircraft he considered his painted with the now-famous nose art. Lewis would fly the mission as Tibbets&#x27;s co-pilot.

At 02:45 the next day—in accordance with the terms of Operations Order No. 35—the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; departed North Field for Hiroshima, Japan, with Tibbets at the controls. Tinian was approximately away from Japan, so it took six hours to reach Hiroshima. The atomic bomb, code-named &quot;Little Boy&quot;, was dropped over Hiroshima at 08:15 local time. Tibbets recalled that the city was covered with a tall mushroom cloud after the bomb was dropped.

Tibbets was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by Spaatz immediately after landing on Tinian. He became a celebrity, with pictures and interviews of his wife and children in the major American newspapers. He was seen as a national hero who had ended the war with Japan. Tibbets later received an invitation from President Harry S. Truman to visit the White House. The 509th Composite Group was awarded an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award in 1999.

== Post-war military career ==
The 509th Composite Group returned to the United States on 6 November 1945, and was stationed at Roswell Army Airfield, New Mexico. Colonel William H. Blanchard replaced Tibbets as group commander on 22 January 1946, and also became the first commander of the 509th Bombardment Wing, the successor to the 509th Composite Group. Tibbets was a technical advisor to the 1946 Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, but he and his &quot;Enola Gay&quot; crew were not chosen to drop another atomic bomb.

Tibbets then attended the Air Command and Staff School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. On graduating in 1947 he was posted to the Directorate of Requirements at Air Force Headquarters at the Pentagon. When the head of the directorate, Brigadier General Thomas S. Power, was posted to London as air attaché, he was replaced by Brigadier General Carl Brandt. Brandt appointed Tibbets as director of Directorate of Requirements&#x27;s Strategic Air Division, which was responsible for drawing up requirements for future bombers. Tibbets was convinced that the bombers of the future would be jet aircraft and thus became involved in the Boeing B-47 Stratojet program. He subsequently served as B-47 project officer at Boeing in Wichita from July 1950 until February 1952. He then became commander of the Proof Test Division at Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, Florida, where flight testing of the B-47 was conducted.

Tibbets returned to Maxwell Air Force Base, where he attended the Air War College. After he graduated in June 1955, he became Director of War Plans at the Allied Air Forces in Central Europe Headquarters at Fontainebleau, France. He left Lucy and his sons behind in Alabama, and he and Lucy divorced that year. During his posting to France, he met a French divorcee named Andrea Quattrehomme, who became his second wife. He returned to the United States in February 1956 to command the 308th Bombardment Wing at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia, and married her in the base chapel on 4 May 1956. They had a son, James Tibbets.

In January 1958, Tibbets became commander of the 6th Air Division at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. and was promoted to brigadier general in 1959. This was followed by another tour of duty at the Pentagon as director of Management Analysis. In July 1962, he was assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff as deputy director for operations, and then, in June 1963, as deputy director for the National Military Command System. In 1964, Tibbets was named military attaché in India. He spent 22 months there on this posting, which ended in June 1966. He retired from the United States Air Force (USAF) on 31 August 1966.

== Later life and death ==

After his retirement from the Air Force, Tibbets worked for Executive Jet Aviation (EJA), an air taxi company based in Columbus, Ohio, and now called NetJets. He was one of the founding board members and attempted to extend the company&#x27;s operations to Europe, but was unsuccessful. He retired from the company in 1968, and returned to Miami, Florida, where he had spent part of his childhood. The banks foreclosed on EJA in 1970, and Bruce Sundlun became president. Sundlun lured Tibbets back to EJA that year. Tibbets succeeded Sundlun as president on 21 April 1976, and remained in the role until 1986. He served for a year as a consultant before his second and final retirement from EJA in 1987.

Tibbets died in his Columbus, Ohio, home on 1 November 2007, at the age of 92. He had suffered small strokes and heart failure during his final years and had been in hospice care. He was survived by his French-born wife, Andrea, and two sons from his first marriage, Paul III and Gene as well as his son, James, from his second marriage. Tibbets had asked for no funeral or headstone, because he feared that opponents of the bombing might use it as a place of protest or destruction. In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered over the English Channel; he had flown over the Channel many times during the war.

Tibbets&#x27; grandson Paul W. Tibbets IV graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1989, and in April 2006 became commander of the 393rd Bomb Squadron, flying the B-2 Spirit at Whiteman AFB, Missouri. The squadron was one of the two operational squadrons that had formed part of the 509th Composite Group when Tibbets commanded it. Paul Tibbets IV was promoted to brigadier general in 2014, and became Deputy Director for Nuclear Operations at the Global Operations Directorate of the United States Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. As such, he was responsible for America&#x27;s strategic nuclear forces. On 5 June 2015, he assumed command of the 509th Bomb Wing.

== Legacy ==
In later life, Tibbets strongly defended the decision to use the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and became a symbolic figure in the debate over their use. At the time of his posting to India, a newspaper denounced him as the &quot;world&#x27;s greatest killer&quot;. In a 1975 interview he said: &quot;I&#x27;m proud that I was able to start with nothing, plan it and have it work as perfectly as it did ... I sleep clearly every night&quot;. &quot;I knew when I got the assignment&quot;, he told a reporter in 2005, &quot;it was going to be an emotional thing. We had feelings, but we had to put them in the background. We knew it was going to kill people right and left. But my one driving interest was to do the best job I could so that we could end the killing as quickly as possible&quot;.

In 1976, the United States government apologized to Japan after Tibbets re-enacted the bombing—complete with a mushroom cloud—in a restored B-29 at an air show in Texas. He said that he had not intended for the re-enactment to insult the Japanese people. In 1995, he denounced the 50th-anniversary exhibition of the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; at the Smithsonian Institution, which attempted to present the bombing in context with the destruction it caused, as a &quot;damn big insult&quot;, due to its focus on the Japanese casualties rather than the brutality of the Japanese government. He was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1996.

== In popular culture ==
Barry Nelson played Tibbets in the film &quot;The Beginning or the End&quot; (1947). &quot;Above and Beyond&quot; (1952) depicted the World War II events that involved Tibbets; Robert Taylor starred as Tibbets and Eleanor Parker played the role of his first wife Lucy. Tibbets was also the model for screenwriter Sy Bartlett&#x27;s fictional character &quot;Major Joe Cobb&quot; in the film &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (1949), and for a brief period in February 1949 was slated to be the film&#x27;s technical advisor until his replacement at the last minute by Colonel John H. deRussy. &quot;Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb&quot;, a 1980 made-for-television movie, somewhat fictionalized, told the story of Tibbets crew. Patrick Duffy played Tibbets and Kim Darby played Lucy.

In other fictional portrayals, Nicholas Kilbertus was Tibbets in the film &quot;Day One&quot; (1989), David Gow played him in the TV movie &quot;Hiroshima&quot; (1995), and Ian Shaw played the part in the BBC&#x27;s TV docudrama &quot;Hiroshima&quot; (2005), for which Tibbets was also interviewed on camera. An interview with Tibbets also appeared in the movie &quot;Atomic Cafe&quot; (1982), as well as was in the 1970s British documentary series &quot;The World at War&quot;, and the &quot;Men Who Brought the Dawn&quot; episode of the Smithsonian Networks&#x27; &quot;War Stories&quot; (1995). Tibbets figured largely in the 2000 book &quot;Duty: A Father, His Son and the Man Who Won the War&quot; by Bob Greene of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. In 1989, he published his memoir &quot;Flight of the Enola Gay&quot; which chronicles his life to that date.

<text>Igor Ivanovich Sikorsky (, ; 25 May 1889 – 26 October 1972) was a Russian–American aviation pioneer in both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. His first success came with the Sikorsky S-2, the second aircraft of his design and construction. His fifth airplane, the S-5, won him national recognition and F.A.I. pilot&#x27;s license number 64. His S-6-A received the highest award at the 1912 Moscow Aviation Exhibition, and in the fall of that year the aircraft won first prize for its young designer, builder and pilot in the military competition at Saint Petersburg. In 1913, the Sikorsky-designed &quot;Russky Vityaz&quot; (S-21) became the first successful four-engine aircraft to take flight. He also designed and built the &quot;Ilya Muromets&quot; (S-22 – S-27) family of four-engine aircraft, an airliner which he redesigned to be the world&#x27;s first four-engine bomber when World War I broke out.

After immigrating to the United States in 1919 because of the Russian Revolution, Sikorsky founded the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation in 1923 and developed the first of Pan American Airways&#x27; ocean-crossing flying boats in the 1930s, including the Sikorsky S-42 &quot;Flying Clipper&quot;.

In 1939, Sikorsky designed and flew the Vought-Sikorsky VS-300, the first viable American helicopter, which pioneered the single main rotor and a single antitorque tail rotor configuration used by most helicopters today. Sikorsky modified the design into the Sikorsky R-4, which became the world&#x27;s first mass-produced helicopter in 1942.

==Early life==
Igor Sikorsky was born in Kiev, Russian Empire (now Kyiv, Ukraine), on May 25, 1889. He was the youngest of five children. His father, Ivan Alexeevich Sikorsky, was a professor of psychology in Saint Vladimir University (now Taras Shevchenko National University), a psychiatrist with an international reputation, and an ardent Russian nationalist.

Igor Sikorsky was an Orthodox Christian. When questioned regarding his roots, he would answer: &quot;My family is of Russian origin. My grandfather and other ancestors from the time of Peter the Great were Russian Orthodox priests.&quot;

Sikorsky&#x27;s mother, Mariya Stefanovna Sikorskaya (née Temryuk-Cherkasova), was a physician who did not work professionally. She is sometimes called Zinaida Sikorsky. While homeschooling young Igor, she gave him a great love for art, especially in the life and work of Leonardo da Vinci, and the stories of Jules Verne. In 1900, at age 11, he accompanied his father to Germany and through conversations with his father became interested in natural sciences. After returning home, Sikorsky began to experiment with model flying machines, and by age 12, he had made a small rubber band-powered helicopter.

Sikorsky began studying at the Saint Petersburg Maritime Cadet Corps in 1903 at the age of 14. In 1906, he determined that his future lay in engineering, so he resigned from the academy, despite his satisfactory standing, and left the Russian Empire to study in Paris. He returned to the Russian Empire in 1907, enrolling at the Mechanical College of the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. After the academic year, Sikorsky again accompanied his father to Germany in the summer of 1908, where he learned of the accomplishments of the Wright brothers&#x27; &quot;Flyer&quot; and Ferdinand von Zeppelin&#x27;s rigid airships. Sikorsky later said about this event: &quot;Within twenty-four hours, I decided to change my life&#x27;s work. I would study aviation.&quot;

By the start of World War I in 1914, Sikorsky&#x27;s airplane research and production business in Kyiv was flourishing, and his factory made bombers during the war. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Igor Sikorsky fled his homeland in early 1918, because the Bolsheviks threatened to shoot him for being &quot;the Tsar&#x27;s friend and a very popular person&quot;. He moved to France where he was offered a contract for the design of a new, more powerful Muromets-type plane. But in November 1918 the war ended, and the French government stopped subsidizing military orders, whereupon he decided to move to the United States. On March 24, 1919, he left France on the ocean liner &quot;Lorraine&quot;, arriving in New York City on March 30, 1919.

==Aircraft designer==
With financial backing from his sister Olga, Sikorsky returned to Paris, the center of the aviation world at the time, in 1909. Sikorsky met with aviation pioneers, to ask them questions about aircraft and flying. In May 1909, he returned to Russia and began designing his first helicopter, which he began testing in July 1909. Powered by a 25 horsepower Anzani engine, the helicopter used an upper and lower two-bladed lifting propeller that rotated in opposite directions at 160 rpm. The machine could only generate about of lift, not enough to lift the approximate weight. Despite his progress in solving technical problems of control, Sikorsky realized that the aircraft would never fly. He finally disassembled the aircraft in October 1909, after he determined that he could learn nothing more from the design. In February 1910, he undertook to build a second helicopter, and his first airplane. By the spring, helicopter No. 2 could lift its weight of , but not the additional weight of an operator.

I had learned enough to recognize that with the existing state of the art, engines, materials, and – most of all – the shortage of money and lack of experience... I would not be able to produce a successful helicopter at that time.

Sikorsky&#x27;s first aircraft of his own design, the S-1, used a 15 hp Anzani 3-cylinder fan engine in a pusher configuration, that could not lift the aircraft. His second design, called the S-2, was powered by a 25 hp Anzani engine in a tractor configuration and first flew on June 3, 1910, at a height of a few feet. On June 30, after some modifications, Sikorsky reached an altitude of &quot;sixty or eighty feet&quot; before the S-2 stalled and was completely destroyed when it crashed in a ravine. Later, Sikorsky built the two-seat S-5, his first design not based on other European aircraft. Flying this original aircraft, Sikorsky earned his pilot license; Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) license No. 64 issued by the Imperial Aero Club of Russia in 1911. During a demonstration of the S-5, the engine quit and Sikorsky was forced to make a crash landing to avoid a wall. It was discovered that a mosquito in the gasoline had been drawn into the carburetor, starving the engine of fuel. The close call convinced Sikorsky of the need for an aircraft that could continue flying if it lost an engine. His next aircraft, the S-6 held three passengers and was selected as the winner of the Moscow aircraft exhibition held by the Russian Army in February 1912.
In early 1912, Igor Sikorsky became Chief Engineer of the aircraft division for the Russian Baltic Railroad Car Works (&quot;Russko-Baltiisky Vagonny Zavod&quot; or &quot;R-BVZ&quot;) in Saint Petersburg. His work at R-BVZ included the construction of the first four-cylinder aircraft, the S-21 &quot;Russky Vityaz&quot;, which he initially called &quot;Le Grand&quot; when fitted with just two engines, then the &quot;Bolshoi Baltisky&quot; (The Great Baltic) when fitted with four engines in two &quot;push-pull&quot; pairs, and finally &quot;Russki Vityaz&quot; in its four engine all tractor-engined configuration. He also served as the test pilot for its first flight on May 13, 1913. In recognition of his accomplishment, he was awarded an honorary degree in engineering from Saint Petersburg Polytechnical Institute in 1914. Sikorsky took the experience from building the Russky Vityaz to develop the S-22 &quot;Ilya Muromets&quot; airliner. Due to the outbreak of World War I, he redesigned it as the world&#x27;s first four-engined bomber, for which he was decorated with the Order of St. Vladimir.

After World War I, Igor Sikorsky briefly became an engineer for the French forces in Russia, during the Russian Civil War. Seeing little opportunity for himself as an aircraft designer in war-torn Europe, and particularly Russia, ravaged by the Bolshevik Revolution and Russian Civil War, he emigrated to the United States, arriving in New York on March 30, 1919.

==Life in the United States==
In the U.S., Sikorsky first worked as a school teacher and a lecturer, while looking for an opportunity to work in the aviation industry. In 1932, he joined the faculty of the University of Rhode Island to form an aeronautical engineering program and remained with the university until 1948. He also lectured at the University of Bridgeport.

In 1923, Sikorsky formed the Sikorsky Manufacturing Company in Roosevelt, New York. He was helped by several former Russian military officers. Among Sikorsky&#x27;s chief supporters was composer Sergei Rachmaninoff, who introduced himself by writing a check for US$5,000 (). Although his prototype was damaged in its first test flight, Sikorsky persuaded his reluctant backers to invest another $2,500. With the additional funds, he produced the S-29, one of the first twin-engine aircraft in the U.S., with a capacity for 14 passengers and a speed of 115 mph. The performance of the S-29, slow when compared to military aircraft of 1918, proved to be a &quot;make or break&quot; moment for Sikorsky&#x27;s funding.

In 1928, Sikorsky became a naturalized citizen of the United States. The Sikorsky Manufacturing Company moved to Stratford, Connecticut in 1929. It became a part of the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (now United Technologies Corporation) in July of that year. The company manufactured flying boats, such as the S-42 &quot;Clipper&quot;, used by Pan Am for transatlantic flights.

Meanwhile, Sikorsky also continued his earlier work on vertical flight while living in Nichols, Connecticut. On February 14, 1929, he filed an application to patent a &quot;direct lift&quot; amphibian aircraft which used compressed air to power a direct lift &quot;propeller&quot; and two smaller propellers for thrust. On June 27, 1931, Sikorsky filed for a patent for another &quot;direct lift aircraft&quot;, and was awarded patent No. 1,994,488 on March 19, 1935. His design plans eventually culminated in the first (tethered) flight of the Vought-Sikorsky VS-300 on September 14, 1939, with the first free flight occurring eight months later on May 24, 1940. Sikorsky&#x27;s success with the VS-300 led to the R-4, which became the world&#x27;s first mass-produced helicopter, in 1942. Sikorsky&#x27;s final VS-300 rotor configuration, comprising a single main rotor and a single antitorque tail rotor, has proven to be one of the most popular helicopter configurations, being used in most helicopters produced today.

==Personal life==
Sikorsky was married to Olga Fyodorovna Simkovitch in the Russian Empire. They were divorced and Olga remained in Russia with their daughter, Tania, as Sikorsky departed following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. In 1923, Sikorsky&#x27;s sisters immigrated to the U.S., bringing six-year-old Tania with them. Sikorsky married Elisabeth Semion (1903–1995) in 1924, in New York. Sikorsky and Elisabeth had four sons; Sergei, Nikolai, Igor Jr. and George.

* Tania Sikorsky von York (March 1, 1918 – September 22, 2008), Sikorsky&#x27;s eldest child and only daughter. Tania was born in Kyiv. Educated in the U.S., she earned a B.A. at Barnard College and a doctorate at Yale University. She was one of the original faculty members of Sacred Heart University in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where she served as Professor of Sociology for 20 years.
* Sergei Sikorsky (1925– ), Sikorsky&#x27;s eldest son. He joined United Technologies in 1951 and retired in 1992, as Vice-President of Special Projects at Sikorsky Aircraft.
* Igor Sikorsky Jr. is an attorney, businessman and aviation historian. Igor Sikorsky III is also a pilot.

Sikorsky died at his home in Easton, Connecticut, on October 26, 1972, and is buried in Saint John the Baptist Russian Orthodox Cemetery, located on Nichols Avenue in Stratford.

==Legacy==
In 1966, Sikorsky was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.

Sikorsky&#x27;s and Andrei Tupolev&#x27;s professional careers were covered in the 1979 Soviet biopic &quot;The Poem of Wings&quot; (), where Sikorsky was portrayed by Yury Yakovlev. A working model of Sikorsky Ilya Muromets was recreated for filming.

The Sikorsky Memorial Bridge, which carries the Merritt Parkway across the Housatonic River next to the Sikorsky corporate headquarters, is named for him. Sikorsky has been designated a Connecticut Aviation Pioneer by the Connecticut State Legislature. The Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation in Stratford, Connecticut, continues to the present day as one of the world&#x27;s leading helicopter manufacturers, and a nearby small airport has been named Sikorsky Memorial Airport.

Sikorsky was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame and the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1987.

In October 2011, one of the streets in Kyiv was renamed for Sikorsky. The decision was made by the City Council at the request of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, which opened its new office on that street. The Sikorsky&#x27;s family house in the city&#x27;s historical center is preserved to this day but is in a neglected condition pending restoration.

In November 2012, one of the Russian supersonic heavy strategic bomber Tu-160, based at the Engels-2 Air Force Base, was named for Igor Sikorsky, which caused controversy among air base crew members. One of the officers said that Igor Sikorsky does not deserve it because he laid the foundations of the U.S., rather than Russian aviation. However, the Long Range Aviation command officer said that Igor Sikorsky is not responsible for the activities of his military aircraft, noted that Sikorsky had also designed the first heavy bomber for Russia. In 2013, &quot;Flying&quot; magazine ranked Sikorsky number 12 on its list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation.

In August 2016, the National technical university of Ukraine &quot;Kyiv politechnical institute&quot; was named &quot;National Technical University of Ukraine &quot;Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute&quot;&quot; after its former student and outstanding aircraft designer.

On March 22, 2018, the Kyiv City Council officially renamed Kyiv International Airport to &quot;Igor Sikorsky Kyiv International Airport Zhuliany&quot;.

==Philosophical and religious views==
Sikorsky was a deeply religious Russian Orthodox Christian and authored two religious and philosophical books (&quot;The Message of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; and &quot;The Invisible Encounter&quot;). Summarizing his beliefs, in the latter he wrote:
==Published works==

<text>Beta vulgaris (beet) is a species of flowering plant in the subfamily Betoideae of the family Amaranthaceae. Economically, it is the most important crop of the large order Caryophyllales. It has several cultivar groups: the sugar beet, of greatest importance to produce table sugar; the root vegetable known as the beetroot or garden beet; the leaf vegetable known as chard or spinach beet or silverbeet; and mangelwurzel, which is a fodder crop. Three subspecies are typically recognised. All cultivars, despite their quite different morphologies, fall into the subspecies &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;vulgaris&quot;. The wild ancestor of the cultivated beets is the sea beet (&quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;maritima&quot;).

== Description ==

&quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; is a herbaceous biennial or, rarely, perennial plant up to in height, rarely 200 cm; cultivated forms are mostly biennial. The roots of cultivated forms are dark red, white, or yellow and moderately to strongly swollen and fleshy (subsp. &quot;vulgaris&quot;); they are brown, fibrous, sometimes swollen, and woody in the wild subspecies. The stems grow erect or, in the wild forms, often procumbent; they are simple or branched in the upper part, and their surface is ribbed and striate. The basal leaves have a long petiole (which may be thickened and red, white, or yellow in some cultivars). The simple leaf blade is oblanceolate to heart-shaped, dark green to dark red, slightly fleshy, usually with a prominent midrib, with entire or undulate margin, 5–20 cm long on wild plants (often much larger in cultivated plants). The upper leaves are smaller, their blades are rhombic to narrowly lanceolate.

The flowers are produced in dense spike-like, basally interrupted inflorescences. Very small flowers sit in one- to three- (rarely eight-) flowered glomerules in the axils of short bracts or in the upper half of the inflorescence without bracts. The hermaphrodite flowers are urn-shaped, green or tinged reddish, and consist of five basally connate perianth segments (tepals), 3–5 × 2–3 mm, 5 stamens, and a semi-inferior ovary with 2–3 stigmas. The perianths of neighbouring flowers are often fused. Flowers are wind-pollinated or insect-pollinated, the former method being more important.

In fruit, the glomerules of flowers form connate hard clusters. The fruit (utricle) is enclosed by the leathery and incurved perianth, and is immersed in the swollen, hardened perianth base. The horizontal seed is lenticular, 2–3 mm, with a red-brown, shiny seed coat. The seed contains an annular embryo and copious perisperm (feeding tissue).

There are 18 chromosomes found in 2 sets, which makes beets diploid. Using chromosome number notation, 2n = 18.
== Taxonomy ==
The species description of &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; was made in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;, at the same time creating the genus &quot;Beta&quot;. Linnaeus regarded sea beet, chard and red beet as varieties (at that time, sugar beet and mangelwurzel had not been selected yet). In the second edition of &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; (1762), Linnaeus separated the sea beet as its own species, &quot;Beta maritima&quot;, and left only the cultivated beets in &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot;. Today sea beet and cultivated beets are considered as belonging to the same species, because they may hybridize and form fertile offspring. The taxonomy of the various cultivated races has a long and complicated history, they were treated at the rank of either subspecies, or convarieties or varieties. Now rankless cultivar groups are used, according to the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants.

&quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; belongs to the subfamily Betoideae in family Amaranthaceae (&quot;s.l&quot;, including the Chenopodiaceae).
&quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; is classified into three subspecies:
* &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;adanensis&quot; (Syn.: &quot;Beta adanensis&quot; ): occurring in disturbed habitats and steppes of Southeast Europe (Greece) and Western Asia (Cyprus, Israel, western Syria and Turkey).
* &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;maritima&quot;, Sea beet, the wild ancestor of all cultivated beets. Its distribution area reaches from the coasts of Western Europe and the Mediterranean Sea to the Near and Middle East.
* &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;vulgaris&quot; (Syn.: &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;cicla&quot; , &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;rapacea&quot; .: all cultivated beets belong to this subspecies. There are five Cultivar groups:
** Altissima Group, sugar beet (Syn. &quot;B. v.&quot; subsp. &quot;v.&quot; convar. &quot;vulgaris&quot; var. &quot;altissima&quot;) - The sugar beet is a major commercial crop due to its high concentrations of sucrose, which is extracted to produce table sugar. It was developed from garden beets in Germany in the late 18th century after the roots of beets were found to contain sugar in 1747.
** Cicla Group, spinach beet or chard (Syn. &quot;B. v.&quot; subsp. &quot;vulgaris&quot; convar. &quot;cicla&quot; var. &quot;cicla&quot;) - The leaf beet group has a long history dating to the second millennium BC. The first cultivated forms were believed to have been domesticated in the Mediterranean, but were introduced to the Middle East, India, and finally China by 850 AD. These were used as medicinal plants in Ancient Greece and Medieval Europe. Their popularity declined in Europe following the introduction of spinach. This variety is widely cultivated for its leaves, which are usually cooked like spinach. It can be found in many grocery stores around the world.
** Flavescens Group, swiss chard (Syn. &quot;B. v.&quot; subsp. &quot;v.&quot; convar. &quot;cicla.&quot; var. &quot;flavescens&quot;) - Chard leaves have thick and fleshy midribs. Both the midribs and the leaf blades are used as vegetables, often in separate dishes. Some cultivars are also grown ornamentally for their coloured midribs. The thickened midribs are thought to have arisen from the spinach beet by mutation.
** Conditiva Group, beetroot or garden beet (Syn. &quot;B. v.&quot; subsp. &quot;v.&quot; convar. &quot;vulgaris&quot; var. &quot;vulgaris&quot;) - This is the red root vegetable that is most typically associated with the word &#x27;beet&#x27;. It is especially popular in Eastern Europe where it is the main ingredient of borscht.
** Crassa Group, mangelwurzel (Syn. &quot;B. v.&quot; subsp. &quot;v.&quot; convar. &quot;vulgaris&quot; var. &quot;crassa&quot;) - This variety was developed in the 18th century from the garden beet for its tubers for use as a fodder crop.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The wild forms of &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; are distributed in southwestern, northern and Southeast Europe along the Atlantic coasts and the Mediterranean Sea, in North Africa, Macaronesia, to Western Asia. Naturalized they occur in other continents. The plants grow at coastal cliffs, on stony and sandy beaches, in salt marshes or coastal grasslands, and in ruderal or disturbed places.

Cultivated beets are grown worldwide in regions without severe frosts. They prefer relatively cool temperatures between 15 and 19 °C. Leaf beets can thrive in warmer temperatures than beetroot. As descendants of coastal plants, they tolerate salty soils and drought. They grow best on pH-neutral to slightly alkaline soils containing plant nutrients and additionally sodium and boron.

== Ecology ==
Beets are a food plant for the larvae of a number of &quot;Lepidoptera&quot; species.

== Cultivation ==


Beets are cultivated for fodder (e.g. mangelwurzel), for sugar (the sugar beet), as a leaf vegetable (chard or &quot;Bull&#x27;s Blood&quot;), or as a root vegetable (&quot;beetroot&quot;, &quot;table beet&quot;, or &quot;garden beet&quot;).

&quot;Blood Turnip&quot; was once a common name for beet root cultivars for the garden. Examples include: Bastian&#x27;s Blood Turnip, Dewing&#x27;s Early Blood Turnip, Edmand Blood Turnip, and Will&#x27;s Improved Blood Turnip.

The &quot;earthy&quot; taste of some beetroot cultivars comes from the presence of geosmin. Researchers have not yet answered whether beets produce geosmin themselves or whether it is produced by symbiotic soil microbes living in the plant. Breeding programs can produce cultivars with low geosmin levels yielding flavours more acceptable to consumers.

Beets are one of the most boron-intensive of modern crops, a dependency possibly introduced as an evolutionary response its pre-industrial ancestor&#x27;s constant exposure to sea spray; on commercial farms, a 60 tonne per hectare (26.8 ton/acre) harvest requires 600 grams of elemental boron per hectare (8.6 ounces/acre) for growth. A lack of boron causes the meristem and the shoot to languish, eventually leading to heart rot.

===Red or purple coloring===
The color of red/purple beetroot is due to a variety of betalain pigments, unlike most other red plants, such as red cabbage, which contain anthocyanin pigments. The composition of different betalain pigments can vary, resulting in strains of beetroot which are yellow or other colors in addition to the familiar deep red. Some of the betalains in beets are betanin, isobetanin, probetanin, and neobetanin (the red to violet ones are known collectively as &quot;betacyanin&quot;). Other pigments contained in beet are indicaxanthin and vulgaxanthins (yellow to orange pigments known as &quot;betaxanthins&quot;). Indicaxanthin has been shown as a powerful protective antioxidant for thalassemia and prevents the breakdown of alpha-tocopherol (vitaminE).

Betacyanin in beetroot may cause red urine in people who are unable to break it down. This is called beeturia.

The pigments are contained in cell vacuoles. Beetroot cells are quite unstable and will &#x27;leak&#x27; when cut, heated, or when in contact with air or sunlight. This is why red beetroots leave a purple stain. Leaving the skin on when cooking, however, will maintain the integrity of the cells and therefore minimize leakage.

==Uses==
=== Nutrition ===
In a 100 gram amount, beets supply 43 calories, contain 88% water, 10% carbohydrates, about 2% protein and have a minute amount of fat (table). The only micronutrients of significant content are folate (27% of the Daily Value, DV) and manganese (16% DV).

=== Culinary ===

Spinach beet leaves are eaten as a pot herb. Young leaves of the garden beet are sometimes used similarly. The midribs of Swiss chard are eaten boiled while the whole leaf blades are eaten as spinach beet.

In some parts of Africa, the whole leaf blades are usually prepared with the midribs as one dish.

The leaves and stems of young plants are steamed briefly and eaten as a vegetable; older leaves and stems are stir-fried and have a flavour resembling taro leaves.

The usually deep-red roots of garden beet can be baked, boiled, or steamed, and often served hot as a cooked vegetable or cold as a salad vegetable. They are also pickled. Raw beets are added to salads. A large proportion of the commercial production is processed into boiled and sterilised beets or into pickles. In Eastern Europe beet soup, such as cold borsch, is a popular dish. Yellow-coloured garden beets are grown on a very small scale for home consumption.

The consumption of beets causes pink urine in some people.

Jews traditionally eat beet on Rosh Hashana (New Year). Its Aramaic name סלקא sounds like the word for &quot;remove&quot; or &quot;depart&quot;; it is eaten with a prayer &quot;that our enemies be removed&quot;.

===Traditional medicine===

The roots and leaves of the beet have been used in traditional medicine to treat a wide variety of ailments. Ancient Romans used beetroot as a treatment for fevers and constipation, amongst other ailments. Apicius in &quot;De re coquinaria&quot; gives five recipes for soups to be given as a laxative, three of which feature the root of beet. Platina recommended taking beetroot with garlic to nullify the effects of &#x27;garlic-breath&#x27;.

Beet greens and Swiss chard are both considered high oxalate foods which are implicated in the formation of kidney stones.

===Phytochemicals and research===
Betaine and betalain, two phytochemical compounds prevalent in &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot;, are under basic research for their potential biological properties.

===Other uses===

Cultivars with large, brightly coloured leaves are grown for decorative purposes.

==History==

The sea beet, the ancestor of modern cultivated beets, prospered along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Beetroot remains have been excavated in the Third dynasty Saqqara pyramid at Thebes, Egypt, and four charred beetroots were found in the Neolithic site of Aartswoud in the Netherlands though it has not been determined whether these were domesticated or wild forms of &quot;B. vulgaris&quot;. Zohary and Hopf note that beetroot is &quot;linguistically well identified&quot;. They state the earliest written mention of the beet comes from 8th century BC Mesopotamia. The Greek Peripatetic Theophrastus later describes the beet as similar to the radish, while Aristotle also mentions the plant. Available evidence, such as that provided by Aristotle and Theophrastus, suggests the leafy varieties of the beet were grown primarily for most of its history, though these lost much of their popularity following the introduction of spinach. The ancient Romans considered beets an important health food and an aphrodisiac.

Roman and Jewish literary sources suggest that in the 1st century BC the domestic beet was represented in the Mediterranean basin primarily by leafy forms like chard and spinach beet. Zohary and Hopf also argue that it is very probable that beetroot cultivars were also grown at the time, and some Roman recipes support this. Later English and German sources show that beetroots were commonly cultivated in Medieval Europe.

===The sugar beet===

Modern sugar beets date back to mid-18th century Silesia where the king of Prussia subsidised experiments aimed at processes for sugar extraction. In 1747 Andreas Marggraf isolated sugar from beetroots and found them at concentrations of 1.3-1.6%. He also demonstrated that sugar could be extracted from beets that was the same as that produced from sugarcane. His student, Franz Karl Achard, evaluated 23 varieties of mangelwurzel for sugar content and selected a local race from Halberstadt in modern-day Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Moritz Baron von Koppy and his son further selected from this race for white, conical tubers. The selection was named &#x27;Weiße Schlesische Zuckerrübe&#x27;, meaning white Silesian sugar beet, and boasted about a 6% sugar content. This selection is the progenitor of all modern sugar beets.
A royal decree led to the first factory devoted to sugar extraction from beetroots being opened in Kunern, Silesia (now Konary, Poland) in 1801. The Silesian sugar beet was soon introduced to France where Napoleon opened schools specifically for studying the plant. He also ordered that be devoted to growing the new sugar beet. This was in response to British blockades of cane sugar during the Napoleonic Wars, which ultimately stimulated the rapid growth of a European sugar beet industry. By 1840 about 5% of the world&#x27;s sugar was derived from sugar beets, and by 1880 this number had risen more than tenfold to over 50%. The sugar beet was introduced to North America after 1830 with the first commercial production starting in 1879 at a farm in Alvarado, California. The sugar beet was also introduced to Chile via German settlers around 1850.

It remains a widely cultivated commercial crop for producing table sugar, in part due to subsidies scaled to keep it competitive with tropical sugar cane.

<doc id="199520" wikidata="Q1061474" url="?curid=199520" title="Invincible-class aircraft carrier">
<text>The &quot;Invincible&quot; class was a class of light aircraft carrier operated by the Royal Navy. Three ships were constructed: , and . The vessels were built as aviation-capable anti-submarine warfare (ASW) platforms to counter the Cold War North Atlantic Soviet submarine threat, and initially embarked Sea Harrier aircraft and Sea King HAS.1 anti-submarine helicopters. With cancellation of the aircraft carriers renewal programme in the 1960s, the three ships became the replacements for &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and &quot;Eagle&quot; fleet carriers and the light fleet carriers, and the Royal Navy&#x27;s sole class of aircraft carrier.

The three vessels saw active service in a number of locations, including the South Atlantic during the Falklands War, the Adriatic during the Bosnian War, and in the Middle East for the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.

&quot;Invincible&quot; was decommissioned in 2005 and put in reserve in a low state of readiness. She was sold to a Turkish scrapyard in February 2011, and left Portsmouth under tow on 24 March 2011. Pursuant to the Strategic Defence and Security Review, 2010, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; followed, decommissioning on 13 March 2011. This left &quot;Illustrious&quot; as the sole remaining ship, serving as a helicopter carrier from 2011 to 2014 when it was decommissioned as well. Although the helicopter carrier HMS &quot;Ocean&quot; remained in service, the Royal Navy was without a true aircraft carrier for the first time in nearly a century, until the commissioning of the first of two aircraft carriers in December 2017.

==Development==
The &quot;Invincible&quot; class has its origins in a sketch design for a 6,000-ton, guided-missile armed, helicopter carrying escort cruiser intended as a complement to the much larger CVA-01-class fleet aircraft carrier. The cancellation of CVA-01 in 1966 meant that the smaller cruiser would now have to provide the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) taskforce with command and control facilities. Two new designs were prepared for this requirement; a 12,500-ton cruiser with missiles forward, six Westland Sea King helicopters and a flight deck aft, somewhat similar to of the Italian Navy and a larger 17,500-ton vessel with a &quot;through-deck&quot;, nine Sea Kings and missiles right forward. By 1970, the &quot;through-deck&quot; design had advanced into a Naval Staff Requirement for an 18,750-ton Through-Deck Command Cruiser (TDCC).

In February 1963, the Hawker P.1127 VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft had landed and taken-off from the carrier and the subsequent Hawker-Siddeley Kestrel had undergone trials from the &quot;Commando carrier&quot; (an aircraft carrier operating helicopters) . It was therefore perfectly possible that the new &quot;cruisers&quot; could be used to operate VTOL aircraft. The new ships were called &quot;through-deck cruisers&quot; and not &quot;aircraft carrier&quot;. This was in part because CVA-01&#x27;s cancellation was so recent, but also because the ships were intended to serve in traditional cruiser roles of C3I and anti-submarine warfare, and were constructed like cruisers. The &quot;aircraft carrier&quot; name did not officially appear in association with the ships until the 1980 Defence Estimates referred to the &quot;Invincible&quot;s as such.

Economic problems in the UK in the early 1970s delayed progress on the new ships, but the design continued to evolve. The order for the first ship was given to Vickers (Shipbuilding) on 17 April 1973. By now, the design was for a 19,000-ton &quot;CAH&quot; (helicopter carrying heavy cruiser, styled after the US Navy hull classification symbols) with up to fourteen aircraft and a Sea Dart missile launcher on the bows.

The government decided that the carrier needed fixed-wing aircraft to defend against Soviet reconnaissance aircraft. In May 1975, it authorised the maritime version of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, which was successfully developed into the Sea Harrier. This meant that the design was reworked again to include a small complement of these VTOL aircraft. The comparatively short flight deck made even STOVL rolling take-offs marginal for launching fully laden Harriers. The development of the ski-jump made it possible to launch in all conditions by propelling the aircraft upwards at the end of its take-off roll. &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Illustrious&quot; were equipped with 7° ski-jumps, and &quot;Ark Royal&quot; carried a 12° ski-jump. The class also had, since 1976, a secondary role as a helicopter carrier, or LPH, in the reinforcement of NATO&#x27;s Northern flank in Norway. In 1998, , with a hull form based on that of the &quot;Invincible&quot; class, was commissioned specifically for this role.
After the 1982 Falklands War, CIWS guns were added to the design. &quot;Illustrious&quot; had them fitted at the last minute before commissioning, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; had them added as a normal part of the building process, and &quot;Invincible&quot; had them fitted during her first overhaul after the Falklands. Initially, &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Illustrious&quot; were fitted with two Vulcan Phalanx units; these were replaced with three Goalkeeper systems. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; retained the three Phalanx CIWS systems she was fitted with when built (she could be easily distinguished from her sisters by the Phalanx&#x27;s distinctive white &quot;R2-D2&quot; radome). Electronic countermeasures were provided by a Thales jamming system and ECM system. Seagnat launchers were provided for chaff or flare decoys. As part of upgrades during the mid-1990s, all three ships had the Sea Dart removed, with the forecastle filled in to increase the size of the flight deck.

===Foreign interest===
In the mid-1970s, the Shah of Iran expressed interest in acquiring three &quot;Invincible&quot;-class ships and a fleet of twenty-five Sea Harriers to provide fleet defence. When the Iranian Navy could not commit to providing sufficient personnel for manning the vessels, the ship order was cancelled in 1976. A later proposal to buy four &quot;Harrier-type&quot; vessels was also discarded, as were later negotiations to buy the Sea Harrier.

The 1981 Defence White Paper and its planned reduction in the size of the carrier fleet saw &quot;Invincible&quot; marked as surplus to requirements, and the ship was offered for sale to the Royal Australian Navy in July 1981 as a replacement for the ageing aircraft carrier . The class had previously been considered and discarded as a potential replacement for the Australian ship, but the low £175 million (A$285 million) offer price and the already-constructed state of the vessel prompted the Australian government to announce in February 1982 their intention to accept the British offer. In Australian service, the ship would have been named HMAS &quot;Australia&quot;, and would operate as a helicopter carrier until a later decision on the acquisition of Sea Harriers was made. &quot;Invincible&quot;″s service during the Falklands War showed that the White Paper&#x27;s suggested reductions were flawed and both nations withdrew from the deal in July 1982.

==Falklands War==
Prior to 1982, &quot;Invincible&quot;″s air group consisted purely of Sea King HAS.5 anti-submarine helicopters and Sea Harrier FRS.1 aircraft. Typically, nine Sea Kings, and four or five Sea Harriers were embarked. This was due to the fact that the originally envisioned mission for the ships was to provide the heart of ASW hunter-killer groups in the North Atlantic during a war against the Soviet Union. In that context, the main weapon of the carrier would not be its fighter aircraft, but its ASW helicopters. The fighters were on board to shoot down the occasional Soviet maritime patrol aircraft nosing around the ship and its escorts.

The Falklands War changed that posture, since it proved that Britain needed to retain the capability to use carrier air power in its traditional role of power projection, both over land, and against enemy fleets. The Falklands War saw &quot;Invincible&quot;, and the larger and older filled to capacity with both the Sea Harrier and the Royal Air Force Harrier GR3 ground attack variant of the aircraft, along with ASW helicopters. The RAF Harriers proved to be a temporary aberration at the time, but a permanent addition to the usual air group was made due to lessons learned during the war: the Sea King AEW2A (airborne early warning) version. &quot;Illustrious&quot; carried the first examples of the type when it was rushed south in the aftermath of the Falklands War to relieve &quot;Invincible&quot; of its guard duty around the islands.

In the aftermath of the Falklands, the typical air group was three AEW Sea Kings, nine ASW Sea Kings and eight or nine Sea Harriers. Analysis of the Sea Harrier&#x27;s performance during the war led to the requirement for an upgrade, approval for which was granted in 1984. The Sea Harrier FA2 entered service in 1993 and deployed on &quot;Invincible&quot; to Bosnia in 1994. The FA2 featured the Blue Vixen radar which was described as one of the most advanced pulse Doppler radars in the world. The FA2 carried the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The final new build Sea Harrier FA2 was delivered on 18 January 1999. Other improvements were made to the class during the 1980s and early 1990s, in particular to increase the ski-jump exit angle on &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Illustrious&quot; to 12° to match &quot;Ark Royal&quot;.

==Modernization==

In later years, three other changes were made. One was the removal of the Sea Dart system, creating an increased deck park for aircraft. The Sea Dart magazines were converted to increase air-to-surface weapons stowage, and new aircrew briefing facilities created under the extended flight deck, both to support the embarkation of RAF Harrier GR7s as a routine part of the air group. The ships were all fitted to handle Merlin helicopters as the Merlin HM1 replaced the Sea King HAS6 in the carrier-borne ASW role. Following the integration of the Harrier GR7, typical deployments included seven or eight of those aircraft, pushing the Merlin onto the carrier&#x27;s accompanying &quot;Fort&quot;-class auxiliaries.

The last wartime deployments of the class saw them in their secondary LPH role, as it was officially judged that Sea Harriers could provide no useful role in the missions. During those deployments, the class embarked RAF Chinook helicopters, in lieu of their fixed-wing complement.

&quot;Invincible&quot;″s final refit was in 2004.

&quot;Illustrious&quot; underwent a 16-month £40 million refit at Rosyth Dockyard during 2010 and 2011 in preparation for her new role as a helicopter carrier during the refit of .

==Final years==

The Sea Harrier was officially retired on 1 April 2006. The principal weapon of the &quot;Invincible&quot;-class carriers then became the Harrier GR9 flown by two Fleet Air Arm and two RAF squadrons until they were retired in 2010.

&quot;Invincible&quot; was decommissioned in July 2005, and was mothballed until September 2010. On 24 March 2011 &quot;Invincible&quot; left Portsmouth under tow for scrapping at Leyal Ship Recycling, Turkey.

&quot;Ark Royal&quot; took over as the flagship, was planned to be decommissioned in 2016, but retired in 2010 following the Strategic Defence and Security Review.

&quot;Illustrious&quot; remained the only one of the class in service, but was also retired in 2014. After being laid up it left Portsmouth under tow to the shipbreakers in Turkey on 7 December 2016.

Two larger s replaced the Invincible class, with the first, HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, commissioned in late 2017. They displace around 65,000 tonnes each – more than three times the displacement of the &quot;Invincible&quot; class.

<text>The Bell Jar is the only novel written by the American writer and poet Sylvia Plath. Originally published under the pseudonym &quot;Victoria Lucas&quot; in 1963, the novel is supposedly semi-autobiographical with the names of places and people changed. The book is often regarded as a &quot;roman à clef&quot; because the protagonist&#x27;s descent into mental illness parallels Plath&#x27;s experiences with what may have been clinical depression or bipolar II disorder. Plath died by suicide a month after its first United Kingdom publication.

The novel was published under Plath&#x27;s name for the first time in 1967. It was not published in the United States until 1971, in accordance with the wishes of both Plath&#x27;s ex-husband Ted Hughes and her mother. In the U.S the book became an instant best seller, and has since been translated into nearly a dozen languages.

==Synopsis==
In 1953, Esther Greenwood, a 19-year-old undergraduate student from the suburbs of Boston, is awarded a summer internship at the fictional &quot;Ladies&#x27; Day&quot; magazine in New York City. During the internship, Esther feels neither stimulated nor excited by the work, fashion, and big-city lifestyle that her peers in the program seem to adore. She finds herself struggling to feel anything at all aside from anxiety and disorientation. Esther appreciates the witty sarcasm and adventurousness of Doreen, another intern, but she identifies with the piety of Betsy, an old-fashioned and naïve young woman. Esther has a benefactor in Philomena Guinea, a formerly successful writer of women&#x27;s fiction, who funds the scholarship through which Esther – from a working-class family – is enrolled at her college.

Esther describes in detail several seriocomic incidents that occur during her internship. In the beginning, she and Doreen meet Lenny, a gallant radio host who tries to seduce them, and who eventually dates Doreen. Another incident occurs with a mass food poisoning during a lunch thrown by the staff of the magazine. Much of the story is spent in flashbacks, where Esther reminisces about her boyfriend Buddy, whom she has dated more or less seriously, and who considers himself her fiancé. Esther&#x27;s internal monologue often lingers on musings of death, violence, and the roles of women in her society. Shortly before the internship ends, she attends a country club party with Doreen, and she is set up with a wealthy Peruvian man named Marco who treats her roughly. Later, Marco takes her outside and tries to rape her; she breaks his nose and leaves. That night, after returning to the hotel, she impulsively throws all of her new and fashionable clothing off the roof.

Esther returns to her Massachusetts home that she shares with her widowed mother. She has been hoping for another scholarly opportunity once she is back in Massachusetts, a writing course taught by a world-famous author, but on her return, she immediately is told by her mother that she was not accepted for the course and finds her plans derailed. She decides to spend the summer potentially writing a novel, but she feels she lacks enough life experience to write convincingly. All of her identity has been centered upon doing well academically; she is unsure of what to make of her life once she leaves school, and none of the choices presented to her (motherhood, as exemplified by the prolific child-bearer Dodo Conway, Esther&#x27;s neighbor, or stereotypical female careers such as stenography) appeal to her. Esther increasingly becomes depressed, and she finds herself unable to sleep. Her mother instructs her to see Dr. Gordon, a psychiatrist, whom Esther mistrusts because he is attractive and does not seem to listen to her. He prescribes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT); afterward, she tells her mother that she will not go back.

The ECT is ineffective, and Esther&#x27;s mental state worsens. She makes several half-hearted attempts at suicide, including swimming far out to sea, then she makes a serious attempt. Esther writes a note for her mother that she &quot;will go out on a long walk&quot;, crawls into a well-hidden hole in the cellar, and swallows many sleeping pills that had been prescribed for her insomnia. The newspapers presume her kidnapping and death, but she is discovered alive under her house after an indeterminate amount of time. She is sent to several different mental hospitals until Philomena Guinea, her college benefactor, supports her stay at an elite treatment center where she meets Dr. Nolan, a female therapist. Along with regular psychotherapy sessions, Esther is given huge amounts of insulin to produce a &quot;reaction&quot; (a common – and now disproven – psychiatric treatment at the time) and again receives ECT. Dr. Nolan ensures that they are properly administered. While there, she describes her depression as a feeling of being trapped under a bell jar, struggling for breath. Eventually, Esther describes the ECT as beneficial in that it has a sort of antidepressant effect; it lifts the metaphorical bell jar in which she has felt trapped and stifled. While there, she becomes reacquainted with Joan Gilling, who also used to date Buddy. The novel heavily implies that Joan is a lesbian and that she is attracted to, or interested in, Esther, who finds her strange.

Esther tells Dr. Nolan how she envies the freedom that men have and how she, as a woman, worries about getting pregnant. Dr. Nolan refers her to a doctor who fits her with a diaphragm. Esther now feels free from her fears about the consequences of sex; free from previous pressures to get married, potentially to the wrong man. Under Dr. Nolan, Esther improves. Various significant events, such as having sex for the first time, being hospitalized as a result, and Joan&#x27;s suicide, provide her with a new perspective. Esther interacts with Buddy again toward the end of the novel when he visits her to ask if it was something about him that drove women to insanity, given that he dated both Joan and Esther. Buddy later wonders out loud who will marry Esther now that she has been hospitalized, effectively ending their commitment to get engaged. Esther feels relieved.

The novel ends with Esther entering a conference with her doctors, who will decide whether she can leave the hospital and return to school.

==Characters==

* Esther Greenwood, the protagonist of the story, is an ambitious English major from Boston. Having won a summer job as a &quot;guest editor&quot; for &quot;Ladies&#x27; Day&quot; magazine, she lives at the Barbizon hotel (referred to in the novel as the &quot;Amazon&quot; hotel) in New York City, along with the other young women who were selected as guest editors. Esther experiences increasing mental instability during her time in New York and over the following weeks. Her realization that she has no idea what she will do after graduation, combined with professional setbacks, social alienation, the trauma of narrowly avoiding being raped, and the feeling that she simply does not fit into the culturally acceptable role of womanhood, escalate Esther‘s emotional state of fear and panic. Though it is not immediately apparent, unresolved grief at the death of her father when she was 8 also affects her. Having returned to live with her mother in the Boston suburbs, and experiencing increasing insomnia, loss of appetite, and an inability to read or write, she becomes fixated on—and later attempts—suicide. Before her precipitous decline in mental health, Esther was known as a hardworking student, with an impressive record of excellent grades and a history of winning awards and recognition for her achievements. With the end of that era in sight, Esther is directionless, having only a vague idea she might go into publishing or become an author and poet. This existential quandary results in increasing self-absorption, leaving her prone to feeling detached and tired. She leaves her friend Doreen with a man they just met, after having been asked to stay to help protect her. Later, Doreen returns to the hotel, very drunk and asking for her. While Esther is helping Doreen to her room, Doreen vomits and passes out. Esther leaves her to sleep it off on the corridor floor, rather than deal with the resultant mess.
* Doreen, another guest editor at &quot;Ladies&#x27; Day&quot; magazine, is a daring and rebellious young woman, and Esther&#x27;s best friend in New York. Esther finds Doreen&#x27;s confident personality and free spirit appealing but troublesome, as she longs to be free of society’s constraints, but fears the possible consequences. Esther admires Doreen’s appearance, humor, personality, and even smell, which she describes as musky and sweet, like freshly crushed ferns. Ultimately, Esther’s fear leads her to reject Doreen and resolve to have little more to do with her, choosing instead to befriend Betsy, a prototypical “good girl”. However, after failing to be accepted into her desired writing program, Esther impulsively writes to Doreen to ask if she can stay with her, but seeing the deterioration of her handwriting frightens her and she never sends the letter.
* Joan, an old acquaintance of Esther, coincidentally ends up in the same mental hospital. Joan also had dated Buddy Willard, but tells Esther later that she was more interested in maintaining a relationship with Buddy&#x27;s parents, whom she idealizes as more concerned and caring than—and therefore, superior to—her own. At the hospital, she and Esther engage in a quiet competition to recover first, an apparently common situation among the patients. Upon abruptly entering Joan’s room, Esther finds her in bed with DeeDee, another female patient. Esther then reflects on other women she has known who have sex with women, wondering what motivates them. When Joan later makes an ambiguous overture to her, Esther cannot figure out whether it was a pass or a gesture of friendship. In response, Esther tells Joan she never has liked her. Later, when Esther hemorrhages as a result of her first sexual experience, Joan helps her get to the emergency room. Joan eventually dies by suicide at the mental hospital. Esther attends her funeral.
* Doctor Nolan is Esther&#x27;s doctor at the mental hospital. A beautiful and caring woman, her personal sensitivity and professional ability combine to make her the first woman in Esther&#x27;s life with whom she feels she can fully connect. Nolan prescribes shock therapy and ensures that it is done correctly, which leads to positive results.
* Doctor Gordon is the first psychiatrist to treat Esther. Self-obsessed and patronizing, he subjects her to poorly administered electric shock treatments that traumatize Esther and utterly fail to help.
* Mrs. Greenwood, Esther&#x27;s mother, loves her daughter, but is constantly urging Esther to mold herself into the societal ideal of white, middle-class womanhood—a goal for which Esther feels no desire at all.
* Buddy Willard is Esther&#x27;s former boyfriend from her hometown. Studying to become a doctor, Buddy wants a wife who mirrors his mother, and hopes Esther will be that for him. Esther adores him throughout high school, but—upon learning that he is no longer a virgin—she loses respect for him and labels him a hypocrite. However, she feels compelled to postpone ending their relationship when Buddy is diagnosed with tuberculosis. He eventually proposes marriage, but Esther rejects his proposal, telling him that she has decided to never marry. Buddy is shocked and responds that Esther is crazy.
* Mrs. Willard, Buddy‘s mother, is a dedicated homemaker with strict, conservative views about both the proper social roles for women and what constitutes sexual propriety. She is set on Buddy and Esther marrying. Joan loves Mrs. Willard and feels that she is the mother Joan always wanted and never had.
* Mr. Willard, Buddy Willard&#x27;s father and Mrs. Willard&#x27;s husband, is a good friend of Esther’s family.
* Constantin, a simultaneous interpreter at the United Nations, is an acquaintance of Mrs. Willard, who sets him up with a blind date with Esther while she is in New York. His alluring foreign accent and sophistication are very attractive to Esther, who contemplates giving her virginity to him when they return to his apartment. Puzzlingly, he chooses instead to spend the night sleeping chastely beside her.
* Irwin is a tall but rather ugly young man, who is the first man Esther has sex with, an initiation that causes her to hemorrhage. He is a &quot;very well-paid professor of mathematics&quot; on the make, and invites Esther to have coffee when they meet, unaware that she is on leave from a mental hospital. Unfortunately, penetrative sex with Irwin causes Esther to hemorrhage, a rare but not unheard of occurrence. As a result, he hastily pays for a cab and sends Esther “home”.
* Jay Cee is Esther&#x27;s boss at &quot;Lady’s Day&quot;. She is very intelligent and capable, so &quot;her plug-ugly looks didn&#x27;t seem to matter&quot;. She is responsible for editing Esther&#x27;s work, which she does with a strictness that devastates Esther’s self-esteem.
* Lenny Shepherd, a wealthy young man and disc jockey living in New York, invites Doreen and Esther for drinks while they are on their way to a party. They go together to his place. Doreen asks Esther to stay with her in case Lenny “tries anything”, but Esther leaves. Doreen and Lenny start dating, taking Doreen away from Esther more often.
* Philomena Guinea, a wealthy, elderly lady, is the person who endowed Esther&#x27;s college scholarship. Esther&#x27;s college requires each girl who is on scholarship to write a letter to her benefactor, thanking him or her. Philomena invites Esther to have a meal with her and is taken with the student. Philomena had been committed at an earlier point in her life, and she insists on covering the cost of an expensive, private mental hospital for Esther, thus saving her from committal to a state-run institution. The inspiration for Philomena is believed to be Olive Higgins Prouty, an author who financially supported Plath before and after her stay in psychiatric care. Prouty struggled with mental breakdowns before meeting Plath, which may have been a direct reason for why she chose to pay for her scholarship.
* Marco, a Peruvian man and friend of Lenny Shepherd, is set up to take Esther to a party, and behaves misogynistically. Reflecting on him, Esther muses that &quot;Women-haters were like gods: invulnerable and chock-full of power&quot;. He assaults her, and attempts to rape her. 
* Betsy, another guest editor at the magazine, is a &quot;good&quot; girl from Kansas whom Esther strives to be more like. She serves as a foil to Doreen. Esther finds herself torn between daring to be like Doreen and wanting to emulate Betsy.
* Hilda, also a guest editor, arouses Esther’s dislike with her callous attitude and cruel comments about the Rosenbergs as they await imminent execution.

==Publication history==
According to her husband, Plath began writing the novel in 1961, after publishing &quot;The Colossus&quot;, her first collection of poetry. Plath may have finished writing the novel in August 1961, although subsequent changes were made in the editing process. After she separated from Hughes, Plath moved to a smaller flat in London, &quot;giving her time and place to work uninterruptedly. Then at top speed and with very little revision from start to finish she wrote &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;,&quot; he explained.

Plath was writing the novel under the sponsorship of the Eugene F. Saxton Fellowship, affiliated with publisher Harper &amp; Row, but it was disappointed by the manuscript and withdrew, calling it &quot;disappointing, juvenile and overwrought&quot;. Early working titles of the novel included &quot;Diary of a Suicide&quot; and &quot;The Girl in the Mirror&quot;.

Upon publication in the United States on 14 April 1971 it became a runaway success, and featured in &quot;The New York Times Best Sellers List&quot; for many consecutive weeks.

The novel was published as an audiobook read by actor Maggie Gyllenhaal in 2015 by Faber &amp; Faber.

==Style and major themes==
The novel is written using a series of flashbacks that reveal parts of Esther&#x27;s past. The flashbacks primarily deal with Esther&#x27;s relationship with Buddy Willard. The reader also learns more about her early college years.

=== Womanhood and women&#x27;s roles ===
&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; addresses the question of socially acceptable identity. It examines Esther&#x27;s &quot;quest to forge her identity, to be herself rather than what others expect her to be.&quot; Esther is expected to become a housewife, and a self-sufficient woman, without the options to achieve independence. Esther feels she is a prisoner to domestic duties and she fears the loss of her inner self. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; sets out to highlight the problems with oppressive patriarchal society in mid-20th-century America.

Throughout the novel, Esther internally muses about sex, virginity, and the expectations on her as a woman therein. A major plot point in the later chapters is Esther being provided a contraceptive implant by a doctor, which allows her to lose her virginity without fear of falling pregnant and thus being expected to become a parent before her time. Earlier in the novel, Esther criticizes the double standard of the expectation that she remains a virgin for Buddy (who intends to marry her), whilst Buddy was able to have a casual sexual relationship with another woman earlier in his life without consequence.

Esther appears to take a near-scientific approach to sex and virginity. A chapter of the novel discusses Esther&#x27;s plan to &quot;have an affair&quot; with someone, simply to &quot;get it over with&quot; (that is, to lose her virginity), but she is too fearful of the impact of pregnancy.

Esther also remarks about her fear of marriage and the constraints a &quot;typical&quot; marriage of the era would have on her identity and personal goals.

=== Mental health ===

Esther describes her life as being suffocated by a bell jar. A bell jar is a thick glass container sometimes used to create a vacuum space. Here, it stands for &quot;Esther&#x27;s mental suffocation by the unavoidable settling of depression upon her psyche&quot;. Throughout the novel, Esther talks of it suffocating her, and recognizes moments of clarity when it is lifted. These moments correlate to her mental state and the effect of her depression. Scholars argue about the nature of Esther&#x27;s &quot;bell jar&quot; and what it can stand for. Some say it is a retaliation against suburban lifestyle, others believe it represents the standards set for a woman&#x27;s life. However, when considering the nature of Sylvia Plath&#x27;s life and death and the parallels between &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; and her life, it is hard to ignore the theme of mental illness.

Psychiatrist Aaron Beck studied Esther&#x27;s mental illness and notes two causes of depression evident in her life. The first is formed from early traumatic experiences, her father&#x27;s death when she was 9 years old. It is evident how affected she is by this loss when she wonders &quot;I thought how strange it had never occurred to me before that I was only purely happy until I was nine years old.&quot; The second cause of her depression is from her perfectionist ideologies. Esther is a woman of many achievements – college, internships and perfect grades. It is this success that puts the unattainable goals into her head, and when she does not achieve them, her mental health suffers. Esther laments, &quot;The trouble was, I had been inadequate all along, I simply hadn&#x27;t thought about it.&quot;

Esther Greenwood has an obvious mental break – that being her suicide attempt which dictates the latter half of the novel. However, Esther&#x27;s entire life shows warning signs that cause this depressive downfall. The novel begins with her negative thoughts surrounding all her past and current life decisions. It is this mindset mixed with the childhood trauma and perfectionist attitude that causes her descent that leads her to attempt suicide.

This novel gives an account of the treatment of mental health in the 1950s. Plath speaks through Esther&#x27;s narrative to describe her experience of her mental health treatment. Just as this novel gives way to feminist discourse and challenges the way of life for women in the 1950s, it also gives a case study of a woman struggling with mental health.

==Parallels in Plath&#x27;s life==
The book contains many references to real people and events in Plath&#x27;s life. Plath&#x27;s magazine scholarship was at &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; magazine beginning in 1953. Philomena Guinea is based on author Olive Higgins Prouty, Plath&#x27;s patron, who funded Plath&#x27;s scholarship to study at Smith College. Plath was rejected from a Harvard course taught by Frank O&#x27;Connor. Dr. Nolan is thought to be based on Ruth Beuscher, Plath&#x27;s therapist, whom she continued seeing after her release from the hospital. A good portion of this part of the novel closely resembles the experiences chronicled by Mary Jane Ward in her autobiographical novel &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;; Plath later stated that she had seen reviews of &quot;The Snake Pit&quot; and believed the public wanted to see &quot;mental health stuff&quot;, so she deliberately based details of Esther&#x27;s hospitalization on the procedures and methods outlined in Ward&#x27;s book. Plath was a patient at McLean Hospital, an upscale facility which resembled the &quot;snake pit&quot; much less than wards in the Metropolitan State Hospital, which may have been where Mary Jane Ward was hospitalized.

In a 2006 interview, Joanne Greenberg said that she had been interviewed in 1986 by one of the women who had worked on &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; with Plath in the college guest editors group. The woman claimed that Plath had put so many details of the students&#x27; lives into &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; that &quot;they could never look at each other again&quot;, and that it had caused the breakup of her marriage and possibly others.

Janet McCann links Plath&#x27;s search for female independence with a self-described neurotic psychology. Ted Hughes, Plath&#x27;s husband, suggested that &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; might have been written as a response to many years of electroshock treatment and the scars it left.

==Reception==
&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; received &quot;warily positive reviews&quot;. The short time span between the publication of the book and Plath&#x27;s suicide resulted in &quot;few innocent readings&quot; of the novel.

The majority of early readers focused primarily on autobiographical connections from Plath to the protagonist. In response to autobiographical criticism, critic Elizabeth Hardwick urged that readers distinguish between Plath as a writer and Plath as an &quot;event&quot;. Robert Scholes, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised the novel&#x27;s &quot;sharp and uncanny descriptions&quot;. Mason Harris of the &quot;West Coast Review&quot; complimented the novel as using &quot;the &#x27;distorted lens&#x27; of madness [to give] an authentic vision of a period which exalted the most oppressive ideal of reason and stability.&quot; Howard Moss of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; gave a mixed review, praising the &quot;black comedy&quot; of the novel, but added that there was &quot;something girlish in its manner [that] betrays the hand of the amateur novelist&quot;.

On November 5, 2019, the &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; on its list of the 100 most inspiring novels.

==Legacy and adaptations==

&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; has been referred to many times in popular media. Iris Jamahl Dunkle wrote of the novel that &quot;often, when the novel appears in American films and television series, it stands as a symbol for teenage angst.&quot;

Larry Peerce&#x27;s &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; (1979) starred Marilyn Hassett as Esther Greenwood, and featured the tagline: &quot;Sometimes just being a woman is an act of courage.&quot; In the film, Joan attempts to get Esther to agree to a suicide pact, which does not occur in the book.

In July 2016, it was announced that Kirsten Dunst would be making her directorial debut with an adaptation of &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; starring Dakota Fanning as Esther Greenwood. In August 2019, it was announced Dunst was no longer attached, and &quot;Bell Jar&quot; will become a limited TV series from Showtime.

<doc id="199527" wikidata="Q26680" url="?curid=199527" title="Barnacle goose">
<text>The barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) is a species of goose that belongs to the genus &quot;Branta&quot; of black geese, which contains species with extensive black in the plumage, distinguishing them from the grey &quot;Anser&quot; species. Despite its superficial similarity to the brant goose, genetic analysis has shown its closest relative is the cackling goose.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The barnacle goose was first classified taxonomically by Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1803. &quot;Branta&quot; is a Latinised form of Old Norse &quot;Brandgás&quot;, &quot;burnt [black] goose&quot; and the specific epithet is from the Ancient Greek &quot;leukos&quot; &quot;white&quot;, and &quot;opsis&quot; &quot;faced&quot;.

In the mediaeval period, the barnacle goose and the similar brant goose were not distinguished, and were formerly believed to spawn from the goose barnacle. This gave rise to the English name of the barnacle goose and the scientific name of the brant goose. The barnacle myth can be dated back to at least the 12th century. Gerald of Wales claimed to have seen these birds hanging down from pieces of timber, William Turner accepted the theory, and John Gerard claimed to have seen the birds emerging from their shells. The legend persisted until the end of the 18th century. In County Kerry, until relatively recently, Catholics abstaining from meat during Lent could still eat this bird because it was considered as fish. It is sometimes claimed that the word comes from a Celtic word for &quot;limpet&quot;, but the sense-history seems to go in the opposite direction.

==Description==
The barnacle goose is a medium-sized goose, long, with a wingspan of and a weight of . It has a white face and black head, neck, and upper breast. Its belly is white. The wings and its back are silver-grey with black-and-white bars that look like they are shining when the light reflects on it. During flight, a V-shaped white rump patch and the silver-grey underwing linings are visible. They look similar to cackling geese but have grey and white instead of brown bodies, and more extensive white on the head; from Canada geese they are additionally distinguished by being smaller, and having smaller beaks. The juveniles are similar to the adults, but like with all geese, can be distinguished by the rounded rather than square-ended mantle and flank feathers.

==Distribution and population size==
There are three original populations of barnacle geese, with separate breeding and wintering ranges. Since the 1960s, two new breeding populations have established themselves, both located along migration routes of two of the original populations. The five populations are:

* Breeding in eastern Greenland, wintering on the Hebrides of western Scotland and in western Ireland. Population increased from about 7,000 individuals in the 1960s to 44,000 in 2011.
* A recently established population, derived from the Greenland population, has bred more-or-less regularly in Iceland since 1964. The population has rapidly increased in the last few decades, with more than 4000 breeding pairs in 2024. They winter in the same area as Greenland population.
* Breeding on Svalbard, Norway, and wintering almost entirely in Solway Firth on the England/Scotland border, with small numbers elsewhere in the region, particularly around Budle Bay in Northumberland. This population increased from a few hundred individuals in the 1940s to about 34,000 in 2004, and 40,000 by the start of the 2020s.
* Breeding on Novaya Zemlya, Dolgy Island, Kanin Peninsula, Yugorsky Peninsula and the Barents Sea coastline in the Russian Arctic, wintering in the Wadden Sea area in southwest Denmark, northwest Germany and the Netherlands. Increased from about 70,000 individuals in 1980 to 1.2 million individuals in 2015.
* A recent population, derived from the Russian population along with escaped captive birds, has become established since 1971; breeding on islands in the Baltic Sea, and on islands and coasts of the southern North Sea (Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium). Winters in or near breeding range or moves to the Wadden Sea. Some exchange with Russian population continues. Rapidly increasing; the Danish, Dutch and Swedish populations each contain several thousand breeding pairs, and the Belgian, Estonian, Finnish and German populations each contain several hundred breeding pairs.

The species has been recorded as a vagrant in eastern Canada and the Northeastern United States; care must be taken to distinguish these wild birds from escaped individuals, as barnacle geese are popular waterfowl with collectors.

==Ecology, behaviour, and life history==
Barnacle geese frequently build their nests high on mountain cliffs, away from predators (primarily Arctic foxes and polar bears), but also away from their feeding grounds such as lakes, rivers. Like all geese, the are not fed by the adults. Instead of bringing food to the newly hatched goslings, the goslings are brought to the ground. The parents show them the way to jump from the cliff and the goslings follow them by imprinting and take the plunge.

Unable to fly, the goslings, in their first days of life, jump off the cliff and fall; their small size, feathery down, and very light weight helps to protect some of them from serious injury when they hit the rocks below, but many die from the impact. Arctic foxes are attracted by the noise made by the parent geese during this time, and capture many dead or injured goslings. The foxes also stalk the young as they are led by the parents to wetland feeding areas. Due to these hardships only 50% of the chicks survive the first month.

==Conservation==
The barnacle goose is common and widespread, and its population and breeding range has increased in recent decades. The barnacle goose is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies.

The Svalbard population was heavily impacted by the early 2020s highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak, with mass mortality involving 11,400 killed in the 2021/22 winter, or about 31% of the population. The two subsequent breeding seasons were however highly productive, allowing the population to recover to close to its former levels by the 2023/24 winter.

==Folklore==

The natural history of the barnacle goose was long surrounded with a legend claiming that they were born of driftwood:
Nature produces [Bernacae] against Nature in the most extraordinary way. They are like marsh geese but somewhat smaller. They are produced from fir timber tossed along the sea, and are at first like gum. Afterwards they hang down by their beaks as if they were a seaweed attached to the timber, and are surrounded by shells in order to grow more freely. Having thus in process of time been clothed with a strong coat of feathers, they either fall into the water or fly freely away into the air. They derived their food and growth from the sap of the wood or from the sea, by a secret and most wonderful process of alimentation. I have frequently seen, with my own eyes, more than a thousand of these small bodies of birds, hanging down on the sea-shore from one piece of timber, enclosed in their shells, and already formed. They do not breed and lay eggs like other birds, nor do they ever hatch any eggs, nor do they seem to build nests in any corner of the earth.
The legend was widely repeated in, for example, Vincent of Beauvais&#x27;s great encyclopedia. However, it was also criticized by other medieval authors, including Albertus Magnus.

This belief may be related to the fact that these geese were never seen in summer, when they were supposedly developing underwater (they were actually breeding in remote Arctic regions) in the form of barnacles—which came to have the name &quot;barnacle&quot; because of this legend.

Based on these legends—indeed, the legends may have been invented for this purpose—some Irish clerics considered barnacle goose flesh to be acceptable fast day food, a practice that was criticized by Giraldus Cambrensis, a Welsh author:

...Bishops and religious men (&quot;viri religiosi&quot;) in some parts of Ireland do not scruple to dine off these birds at the time of fasting, because they are not flesh nor born of flesh... But in so doing they are led into sin. For if anyone were to eat of the leg of our first parent (Adam) although he was not born of flesh, that person could not be adjudged innocent of eating meat.

At the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of these geese during Lent, arguing that despite their unusual reproduction, they lived and fed like ducks and so were of the same nature as other birds.

The question of the nature of barnacle geese also came up as a matter of Jewish dietary law in the Halakha, and Rabbeinu Tam (1100–71) determined that they were kosher (even if born of trees) and should be slaughtered following the normal prescriptions for birds. 

In one Jewish legend, the barnacle goose is purported to have its beak forever attached to the tree from which it grew just as the Adne Sadeh is fixed to the earth by its navel cord. The mythical barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese, may have a similar origin to the other legends already mentioned.

<text>Salar de Uyuni (or &quot;Salar de Tunupa&quot;) is the world&#x27;s largest salt flat, or playa, at in area. It is in the Daniel Campos Province in Potosí in southwest Bolivia, near the crest of the Andes at an elevation of above sea level.

The Salar was formed as a result of transformations between several prehistoric lakes that existed around forty thousand years ago but had all evaporated over time. It is now covered by a few meters of salt crust, which has an extraordinary flatness with the average elevation variations within one meter over the entire area of the Salar. The crust serves as a source of salt and covers a pool of brine, which is exceptionally rich in lithium. The large area, clear skies, and exceptional flatness of the surface make the Salar ideal for calibrating the altimeters of Earth observation satellites. Following rain, a thin layer of dead calm water transforms the flat into the world&#x27;s largest mirror, across.

The Salar serves as the major transport route across the Bolivian Altiplano and is a prime breeding ground for several species of flamingos. Salar de Uyuni is also a climatological transitional zone since the towering tropical cumulus congestus and cumulonimbus incus clouds that form in the eastern part of the salt flat during the summer cannot permeate beyond its drier western edges, near the Chilean border and the Atacama Desert.

The Salar has been used as a filming location for movies such as &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; (2017; as planet Crait), &quot;The Fall&quot; (2006), &quot;Salt and Fire&quot; (2016), &quot;The Unseen&quot; (2017), and several others.

==Formation, geology, and climate==
Salar de Uyuni is part of the Altiplano of Bolivia in South America. The Altiplano is a high plateau, which was formed during uplift of the Andes mountains. The plateau includes fresh and saltwater lakes as well as salt flats and is endorheic.

===History===
The geological history of the Salar is associated with a sequential transformation between several vast lakes. Some 30,000 to 42,000 years ago, the area was part of a giant prehistoric lake, Lake Minchin. Its age was estimated by radiocarbon dating shells from outcropping sediments and carbonate reefs and varies between reported studies. Lake Minchin (named after Juan B. Minchin of Oruro) later transformed into Paleo Lake Tauca having a maximal depth of , and an estimated age of 13,000 to 18,000 or 14,900 to 26,100 years, depending on the source. The youngest prehistoric lake was Coipasa, which was radiocarbon dated to 11,500 to 13,400 years ago. When it dried, it left behind two modern lakes, Poopó and Uru Uru, and two major salt deserts, Salar de Coipasa and the larger Salar de Uyuni. Salar de Uyuni spreads over 10,582 km2, which is roughly 100 times the size of the Bonneville Salt Flats in the United States. Lake Poopó is a neighbor of the much larger Lake Titicaca. During the wet season, Titicaca overflows and discharges into Poopó, which in turn, floods Salar De Coipasa and Salar de Uyuni.

Lacustrine mud that is interbedded with salt and saturated with brine underlies the surface of Salar de Uyuni. The brine is a saturated solution of sodium chloride, lithium chloride, and magnesium chloride in water. It is covered with a solid salt crust varying in thickness between tens of centimeters and a few meters. The center of the Salar contains a few islands, which are the remains of the tops of ancient volcanoes submerged during the era of Lake Minchin. They include unusual and fragile coral-like structures and deposits that often consist of fossils and algae.

===Climate===

The area has a relatively stable average temperature with a peak at in November to January, and a low of in June. The nights are cold all through the year, with temperatures between . The relative humidity is rather low and constant throughout the year at 30% to 45%. The rainfall is also low at per month between April and November, but it may increase up to in January. However, except for January, even in the rainy season the number of rainy days is fewer than 5 per month.

==Economic influence==
Located in the Lithium Triangle, the Salar contains a large amount of sodium, potassium, lithium and magnesium (all in the chloride forms of NaCl, KCl, LiCl and MgCl2, respectively), as well as borax. As of 2024, with an estimated 23 mln. t, Bolivia holds about 22% of the world&#x27;s known lithium resources (105 mln. tons); most of those are in the Salar de Uyuni.

Lithium is concentrated in the brine under the salt crust at a relatively high concentration of about 0.3%. It is also present in the top layers of the porous halite body lying under the brine; however, the liquid brine is easier to extract, by boring into the crust and pumping out the brine. The brine distribution has been monitored by the Landsat satellite and confirmed in ground drilling tests. Following those findings, an American-based international corporation has invested $137 million to developing lithium extraction. However, lithium extraction in the 1980s and 1990s by foreign companies met strong opposition from the local community. Locals believed that the money infused by mining would not reach them. The lithium in the salt flats contains more impurities, and the wet climate and high altitude make it harder to process.

No mining plant is currently at the site, and the Bolivian government does not want to allow exploitation by foreign corporations. Instead, it intends to reach an annual production of 35,000 t by 2023 in a joint venture with ACI Systems Alemania GmbH.

Salar de Uyuni is estimated to contain 10 billion tonnes (9.8 billion long tons; 11 billion short tons) of salt, of which less than 25,000 t is extracted annually. All miners working in the Salar belong to Colchani&#x27;s cooperative. Because of its location, large area, and flatness, the Salar is a major car transport route across the Bolivian Altiplano, except when seasonally covered with water.

==Name==
&quot;Salar&quot; means salt flat in Spanish. &quot;Uyuni&quot; originates from the Aymara language and means a pen (enclosure); Uyuni is a surname and the name of a town that serves as a gateway for tourists visiting the Salar. Thus &quot;Salar de Uyuni&quot; can be loosely translated as a salt flat with enclosures, the latter possibly referring to the &quot;islands&quot; of the Salar; or as &quot;salt-flat at Uyuni (the town named &#x27;pen for animals&#x27;)&quot;.

Aymara legend tells that the mountains Tunupa, Kusku, and Kusina, which surround the Salar, were giant people. Tunupa married Kusku, but Kusku ran away from her with Kusina. Grieving Tunupa started to cry while breastfeeding her son. Her tears mixed with milk and formed the Salar. Many locals consider the Tunupa an important deity and say that the place should be called Salar de Tunupa rather than Salar de Uyuni.

==Flora and fauna==
The Salar is virtually devoid of any wildlife or vegetation. The latter is dominated by giant cacti (&quot;Echinopsis atacamensis pasacana&quot;, &quot;Echinopsis tarijensis&quot;, etc.). They grow at a rate of about 1 cm/a to a height of about . Other shrubs include Pilaya, which is used by locals to cure catarrh, and Thola (&quot;Baccharis dracunculifolia&quot;), which is burned as a fuel. Also present are quinoa plants and queñua bushes.

Every November, Salar de Uyuni is the breeding ground for three South American species of flamingo feeding on local brine shrimps: the Chilean, Andean, and rare James&#x27;s flamingos. About 80 other bird species are present, including the horned coot, Andean goose, and Andean hillstar. The Andean fox, or culpeo, is also present, and islands in the Salar (in particular Incahuasi Island) host colonies of rabbit-like viscachas.

==Tourism==

===Hotels===

Salar de Uyuni is a popular tourist destination, and consequently a number of hotels have been built in the area. Due to lack of conventional construction materials, many of them are almost entirely (walls, roof, furniture) built with salt blocks cut from the Salar. The first such hotel, named Palacio de Sal, was erected in 1993–1995 in the middle of the salt flat, and soon became a popular tourist destination. However, its location in the center of a desert caused sanitation problems, as most waste had to be collected manually. Mismanagement caused serious environmental pollution and the hotel had to be dismantled in 2002.

Around 2007, a new hotel was built, under the name Palacio de Sal, in a new location 
at the eastern edge of Salar de Uyuni, 25 km away from the town of Uyuni. The sanitary system has been restructured to comply with the government regulations. The hotel has a dry sauna and a steam room, a saltwater pool and whirlpool baths.

===Train cemetery===
One major tourist attraction is an antique train cemetery. It is outside Uyuni and is connected to it by the old train tracks. The town served in the past as a distribution hub for the trains carrying minerals en route to Pacific Ocean ports. The rail lines were built by British engineers arriving near the end of the 19th century and formed a sizeable community in Uyuni. The engineers were invited by the British-sponsored Antofagasta and Bolivia Railway Companies, now Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia. The rail construction started in 1888 and ended in 1892. It was encouraged by Bolivian President Aniceto Arce, who believed Bolivia would flourish with a good transport system, but it was also constantly sabotaged by the local Aymara indigenous Indians who saw it as an intrusion into their lives. The trains were mostly used by the mining companies. In the 1940s, the mining industry collapsed, partly because of mineral depletion. Many trains were abandoned, producing the train cemetery. There are proposals to build a museum from the cemetery.

===Incidents===
Multiple fatal incidents have occurred at the salt flat as a result of poorly maintained vehicles, untrained drivers, speeding, a disregard for the inhospitable conditions, and lack of regulation for tour companies. A total of 16 reported accidents have happened with 30+ deaths in total.

==Satellite calibration==
Salt flats are ideal for calibrating the distance measurement equipment of satellites because they are large, stable surfaces with strong reflection, similar to that of ice sheets. As the largest salt flat on Earth, Salar de Uyuni is especially suitable for this purpose. In the low-rain period from April to November, due to the absence of industry and its high elevation, the skies above Salar de Uyuni are very clear, and the air is dry (relative humidity is about 30%; rainfall is roughly per month). It has a stable surface, smoothed by seasonal flooding — water dissolves the salt surface and thus keeps it leveled.

As a result, the variation in the surface elevation over the area of Salar de Uyuni is less than normal to the Earth&#x27;s circumference, and there are few square kilometers on Earth that are as flat. The surface reflectivity (albedo) for ultraviolet light is relatively high at 0.69 and shows variations of only a few percent during the daytime. The combination of all these features makes Salar de Uyuni about five times better for satellite calibration than the surface of an ocean. Using Salar de Uyuni as the target, ICESat has already achieved the short-term elevation measurement accuracy of below .

By using data from MISR to perform passive optical bathymetry when the flat is flooded and calibrating the resultant water depth model with topographical data from the laser altimeter of ICESat, it has been shown that the Salar de Uyuni is not perfectly flat. The 2006 analysis revealed previously missed features: ridges between in height that are roughly sinusoidal with a wavelength of (clearly visible in 1973 and 1975 LandSat images, and still in the same places decades later), and a moat around the periphery that is wide and deep. They originate from the variation in material density, and thus the gravitational force, beneath the Salar&#x27;s sediments. Just as the ocean surface rises over denser seamounts, the salt flat surface also rises and falls to reflect the subsurface density variations.

<text>The red-breasted goose (Branta ruficollis) is a brightly marked species of goose in the genus &quot;Branta&quot; from Eurasia. It is currently classified as vulnerable by the IUCN.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
The red-breasted goose is sometimes placed in its own genus &quot;Rufibrenta&quot; but appears close enough to the brant goose (&quot;Branta bernicla&quot;) to make this unnecessary, despite its distinct appearance. Today all major authorities include the red-breasted goose in &quot;Branta&quot;. Genetic studies indicate that the red-breasted goose may be one the few known examples of hybrid speciation in birds, being the result of ancient interbreeding between the ancestral brant goose and white-cheeked goose (the latter being the ancestral species that later split into all today&#x27;s &quot;Branta&quot; species, except the brant and red-breasted geese). This interbreeding appears to have happened at least 3.5 million years ago, with the lineage of the red-breasted goose following its own evolutionary path since then.

&quot;Branta&quot; is a Latinised form of Old Norse &quot;Brandgás&quot;, &quot;burnt (black) goose and &quot;ruficollis&quot; is from the Latin &quot;rufus&quot; &quot;red&quot; and &quot;collis&quot; &quot;necked&quot;.

== Description ==

All the species of the genus &quot;Branta&quot; are distinguished by their dark sooty colour, relieved by white, and as a distinction from the grey geese of the genus &quot;Anser&quot;. Among the species from these two genera, the red-breasted goose is the smallest at in length. This brightly marked species is unmistakable, but can be surprisingly difficult to find amongst brant geese. At long distances, the red of the breast tends to look dark.

== Distribution ==
The red-breasted goose breeds in Arctic Siberia, mainly on the Taymyr Peninsula, with smaller populations in the Gyda and Yamal peninsulas. Most winter along the northwestern shores of the Black Sea in Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine (occasionally moving further southwest to Greece), but some winter in Azerbaijan. It is a rare vagrant to Ireland and other western European areas, where it is sometimes found with flocks of Brent or barnacle geese. However, since it is common in captive wildfowl collections, escapees outside its usual range are fairly frequent.

A large part of the population traditionally wintered in Kirov Bay in the Caspian Sea, but in the 1960s the area became unsuitable for the geese due to the agricultural change. Vineyards and cotton replaced the cereal crops used by the wintering geese. However, catastrophic population decline was avoided because they were able to alter their migration strategy and now winter in suitable habitats in Bulgaria and the Dobrogea region of Eastern Romania.

Late Pleistocene remains of the species have been found in Bulgaria, and it is featured on ancient Egyptian paintings, including the famous Meidum Geese.

== Behaviour ==
Calls of red-breasted goose – &quot;ki-kui&quot; or &quot;ki-yik&quot;, shrill and staccato

The red-breasted goose often nests close to nests of birds of prey, such as snowy owls, peregrine falcons and rough-legged buzzards, which helps to protect this small goose from mammalian predators such as the Arctic fox. The closer the goose&#x27;s nest to the eyrie (bird of prey nest), the safer it is from predation. Based on the size and how timid the geese are, they rely on the bird of prey for defense. It is extremely unusual for the bird of prey to attack, but is still possible. Additionally, the larger the colony the safer it is. This in turn positively influences the survival and reproductive success of the red-breasted goose. Aside from nesting close to birds of prey, red-breasted geese nest on islands on rivers which also protects them from land-based predators. However, there is evidence that the red-breasted goose will prefer to nest near birds of prey over the choice of a river island. In contrast to the birds of prey that offer the red-breasted goose protection from predators, which choose to place their nests in the open cliff side, this goose will create a cryptic nest hidden much better than the birds of prey nests. A typical red-breasted goose colony is around 4 pairs depending on nest location, food abundance, and bird of prey density. While incubating, the red-breasted goose stays within a range of its nest. Male red-breasted goose tend to guard the nest of their young from a distance while the females generally hide on the nest. The main predator for red-breasted geese eggs and goslings is the Taimyr Gull which have access to nests located on river islands.

While wintering, the red-breasted goose feeds on grasses, leaves and seeds. Since owl and buzzard populations fluctuate every few years, depending on lemming abundance, the only consistent protection from predators are river islands and the peregrine falcon.

== Conservation ==

In autumn of 1997 the population was estimated to be around 88,000 individuals. In the winter these numbers can shrink to around 70,000. The red-breasted goose is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. The red-breasted goose is legally protected in many states, however hunting is still continued. The AEWA is monitoring the species and providing up to date information on the status of the species, its habitat, migrations, ecology, and conservation needs. It was considered a Vulnerable species by the IUCN. Over 80% of the population roost during the winter at just five sites, with nearby feeding areas threatened by changes in land use. In addition, there has been a strong decline in numbers in the last decades. However, it is possible that this decline may have been exaggerated, as it is possible that some birds may winter at unknown sites. The species&#x27; winter distribution has already changed significantly since the 1960s when much of the population occurred along the western coast of the Caspian Sea, in Iran, and in Iraq. Some birds may now be wintering farther west as indicated by recorded counts of 2,000 birds in Hungary as of the winter of 2014, whereas counts previously only accounted for a few hundred. As it is not clear to what extent the known population fluctuates in this species—as in other Arctic geese—and given the worsening outlook for the species as a whole, the red-breasted goose was uplisted from a species of Least Concern to Endangered status in the 2007 IUCN Red List. In 2015 it was relisted as Vulnerable. There have been attempts to conserve the species, such as in 2005–2008, a Life-funded project in Romania was implemented so that the habitat quality of an important salt water lake used by the species was increased. The Life Programme and AEWA hosted a workshop in February 2009 for the species that aimed to draft a new International Species Action Plan and report the results of the Life project.

In 2011, Ornithologists from the Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds (BSPB/BirdLife in Bulgaria) and the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust enacted a project that would lead to a greater understanding of the red-breasted geese&#x27;s migration patterns. Six red-breasted geese were branded and given miniature GPS transmitters. The red-breasted geese will now be tracked via satellite. Scientist and conservationists alike hope that learning about the geese&#x27;s migration patterns will lead to proper conservation and more aggressive policies in the geese&#x27;s territory. Some prior counts have revealed a more positive discovery, noting an increase in the geese&#x27;s population. This led to a prediction which states there may be over a fifty percent increase in their population.

In February 2013, the Bulgarian court had overturned a decision which prohibited an energy wind project from continuing their work in an important winter site for the threatened red-breasted geese. The construction of wind turbines in the area not only threaten the geese by being an obstacle that they fly into. The area they are being constructed in will also deprive red-breasted geese of a critical feeding ground. As of now, an appeal had been sent to court to convince the court otherwise.

<doc id="199532" wikidata="Q2479290" url="?curid=199532" title="USS Baltimore (1798)">
<text>USS &quot;Baltimore&quot; was a ship of the United States Navy.

This 20-gun ship was built in 1798 by Joseph Caverly in Baltimore, Maryland, as &quot;Adriana&quot;. She was purchased with funds donated by the citizens of Baltimore to the Navy on 23 May 1798, renamed &quot;Baltimore&quot;, and placed under the command of Captain Isaac Phillips.

In August 1798 the &quot;Baltimore&quot; was ordered to join the &quot;Constellation&quot; and convoy a fleet of merchantmen home from Havana, Cuba. Late in 1798, &quot;Baltimore&quot; and &quot;Constitution&quot; were escorting a large convoy to Havana, when the latter sprung her bowsprit and returned home. &quot;Baltimore&quot; later, off Havana, Cuba, fell in with a British squadron consisting of HMS Carnatic(74), HMS Thunder(reportedly a 74 gun ship-of-the-line, but only Thunder in service at the time was an 8 gun vessel), (98), (32), HMS Greyhound (28) on 16 November 1798, who impressed 55 of her crew (50 were returned). Some of the escorted merchantmen were captured. On his return to the United States, Captain Phillips was dismissed for permitting an &quot;outrage to the American flag&quot;. The incident also created much anti-British feeling among the Americans. Capt. Phillips was temporarily replaced as captain by Lt. Josias M. Speake with letter dated 10 January, 1799. Samuel Barron became her captain mid-March 1799. 

During 1799 &quot;Baltimore&quot; took two prizes, and the following year three more, as well as recapturing three American vessels which had fallen into French hands. Sometime just before 11 June, 1799, she and USRC Eagle captured a prize, probably French ship &quot;Siren&quot;. In a letter dated 17 July Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert stated that her gun deck was so low that in a good wind her guns were useless. On 20 December, 1799 under command of Master Commandant William Cowper (pronounced Cooper), she captured French brig L&#x27;Esperance 9-10 leagues west north west of Basse-Terre, Guadaloupe, prize was towed to St Christophers. On 12 January, 1800 she captured privateer &quot;Le Bullant Jeunesse&quot; (). The next day she had an exchange with a French vessel, damaging it, but broke off the engagement fearing losing the prize ship. On 26 March, 1800 she captured French schooner &quot;Brilliant Jeunesse&quot;. On 21 June she captured Polacre &quot;Emmanuel&quot;. The next day she recaptured schooner &quot;Jolly Robbins&quot; and about the same time recaptured &quot;Sea Flower&quot;. On 12 July, 1800 she captured armed schooner &quot;La Quinolla&quot;. On 30 September she was ordered home by Guadalupe Station Commander Thomas Truxton due to poor condition and her crew&#x27;s enlistment having expired. She arrived at Norfolk, and was then ordered to Baltimore on 21 October. On 19 November Navy Secretary Benjamin Stoddert issued Orders for her to be sold. At the close of the Quasi-War with France, she carried the ratified peace treaty to France. Upon her return, &quot;Baltimore&quot; was sold at Philadelphia in 1801.

<text>The third USS &quot;Baltimore&quot; was a side-wheel steamer in the United States Navy.

&quot;Baltimore&quot; was built in 1848 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, captured on the Potomac River between Aquia Creek and Washington, D.C., by the Army on April 21, 1861, turned over to the Navy Department, and commissioned in April 1861, Lieutenant J. H. Russell in command.

==Service history==
During the American Civil War the &quot;Baltimore&quot; was used as an ordnance vessel between Washington Navy Yard and nearby ammunition depots. She was also used to ferry Army troops across the Potomac River. On 19 May 1861, she ran aground at the mouth of the Potomac River and was attacked by a Confederate States Navy ram. Nine people were killed. She was refloated with assistance from . She saw some service with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron as a dispatch and supply vessel. On May 9, 1862, she transported President Abraham Lincoln, and Secretaries Edwin M. Stanton and Salmon P. Chase, from Fort Monroe to Norfolk, Virginia in an attempt to get a close view of the destroyed Confederate ironclad .

&quot;Baltimore&quot; was turned over to Norfolk Navy Yard on May 22, 1865, and sold on June 24, 1865, at Washington DC.

<text>Ecdysozoa () is a group of protostome animals, including Arthropoda (insects, chelicerates (including arachnids), crustaceans, and myriapods), Nematoda, and several smaller phyla. The grouping of these animal phyla into a single clade was first proposed by Eernisse &quot;et al.&quot; (1992) based on a phylogenetic analysis of 141 morphological characters of ultrastructural and embryological phenotypes. This clade, that is, a group consisting of a common ancestor and all its descendants, was formally named by Aguinaldo &quot;et al.&quot; in 1997, based mainly on phylogenetic trees constructed using 18S ribosomal RNA genes.

A large study in 2008 by Dunn &quot;et al.&quot; strongly supported the monophyly of Ecdysozoa.

The group Ecdysozoa is supported by many morphological characters, including growth by ecdysis, with moulting of the cuticle – without mitosis in the epidermis – under control of the prohormone ecdysone, and internal fertilization.

The group was initially contested by a significant minority of biologists. Some argued for groupings based on more traditional taxonomic techniques, while others contested the interpretation of the molecular data.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Ecdysozoa&quot; is scientific Greek, derived from (&#x27;) &quot;shedding&quot; + (&#x27;) &quot;animal&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
The most notable characteristic shared by ecdysozoans is a three-layered cuticle (four in Tardigrada) composed of organic material, which is periodically molted as the animal grows. This process of molting is called ecdysis, and gives the group its name. The ecdysozoans lack locomotory cilia and produce mostly amoeboid sperm, and their embryos do not undergo spiral cleavage as in most other protostomes. Ancestrally, the group exhibited sclerotized teeth within the foregut, and a ring of spines around the mouth opening, though these features have been secondarily lost in certain groups. An unpaired ventral nerve cord, present in Priapulida and Nematoida, appear to be the ancestral condition, making the paired ventral nerve cord found in Panarthropoda, Kinorhyncha and Loricifera a derived trait. A respiratory and circulatory system is only present in onychophorans and arthropods (often absent in smaller arthropods like mites); in the rest of the groups, both systems are missing.

== Phylogeny ==

The Ecdysozoa include the following phyla: Arthropoda, Onychophora, Tardigrada, Kinorhyncha, Priapulida, Loricifera, Nematoda, and Nematomorpha. A few other groups, such as the gastrotrichs, have been considered possible members but lack the main characters of the group, and are now placed elsewhere. The Arthropoda, Onychophora, and Tardigrada have been grouped together as the Panarthropoda because they are distinguished by segmented body plans. Dunn &quot;et al.&quot; in 2008 suggested that the tardigrada could be grouped along with the nematodes, leaving Onychophora as the sister group to the arthropods. The non-panarthropod members of Ecdysozoa have been grouped as Cycloneuralia but they are more usually considered paraphyletic in representing the primitive condition from which the Panarthropoda evolved.

A modern consensus phylogenetic tree for the protostomes is shown below. It is indicated when approximately clades radiated into newer clades in millions of years ago (Mya); dashed lines show especially uncertain placements.

The phylogenetic tree is based on Nielsen &quot;et al.&quot; and Howard &quot;et al.&quot;.

== Older alternative groupings ==

=== Articulata hypothesis ===
The grouping proposed by Aguinaldo &quot;et al.&quot; is almost universally accepted, replacing an older hypothesis that Panarthropoda should be classified with Annelida in a group called the Articulata, and that Ecdysozoa are polyphyletic. Nielsen has suggested that a possible solution is to regard Ecdysozoa as a sister-group of Annelida, though later considered them unrelated.
Inclusion of the roundworms within the Ecdysozoa was initially contested but since 2003, a broad consensus has formed supporting the Ecdysozoa and in 2011 the Darwin–Wallace Medal was awarded to James Lake for the discovery of the New Animal Phylogeny consisting of the Ecdysozoa, the Lophotrochozoa, and the Deuterostomia.

=== Coelomata hypothesis ===

Before Aguinaldo&#x27;s Ecdysozoa proposal, one of the prevailing theories for the evolution of the bilateral animals was based on the morphology of their body cavities. There were three types, or grades of organization: the Acoelomata (no coelom), the Pseudocoelomata (partial coelom), and the Eucoelomata (true coelom). Adoutte and coworkers were among the first to strongly support the Ecdysozoa. With the introduction of molecular phylogenetics, the coelomate hypothesis was abandoned, although some molecular, phylogenetic support for the Coelomata continued until as late as 2005.
