<text>The fourth USS &quot;Princeton&quot; (CVL-23) was a United States Navy light aircraft carrier active in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. She was launched in 1942 and lost at the Battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944.

== Construction and deployment ==
The ship was laid down as the &quot;Tallahassee&quot; (CL-61) by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, 2 June 1941. She was reclassified as the Independence-class light aircraft carrier CV-23 on 16 February 1942, renamed &quot;Princeton&quot; 31 March 1942, launched 18 October 1942, sponsored by Margaret Dodds (wife of Princeton University president Harold Dodds), and commissioned at Philadelphia 25 February 1943, Capt. George R. Henderson in command.

Following shakedown in the Caribbean, and reclassification to CVL-23 on 15 July 1943, &quot;Princeton&quot;, with Air Group 23 embarked, got underway for the Pacific. Arriving at Pearl Harbor 9 August, she sortied with TF 11 on 25 August and headed for Baker Island. There she served as flagship, TG 11.2 and provided air cover during the occupation of the island and the construction of an airfield there, 1–14 September. During that time her planes downed Japanese Emily reconnaissance planes and, more importantly, furnished the fleet with photographs of them.

Completing that mission, &quot;Princeton&quot; rendezvoused with TF 15, conducted strikes against enemy installations on Makin and Tarawa, then headed back to Pearl Harbor. In mid-October, she sailed for Espiritu Santo where she joined to form TF 38 on 20 October. With that force, she sent her planes against airfields at Buka and Bonis on Bougainville (1–2 November) to diminish Japanese aerial resistance during the landings at Empress Augusta Bay. On 5 and 11 November her planes along with those from &quot;Saratoga&quot; undertook a risky air raid to neutralize a squadron of Japanese heavy cruisers while raiding Rabaul and on the 19th, with TF 50, helped neutralize the airfield at Nauru. &quot;Princeton&quot; then steamed northeast, covered the garrison groups en route to Makin and Tarawa and, after exchanging operational aircraft for damaged planes from other carriers, got underway for Pearl Harbor and the west coast.

On 3 January 1944, &quot;Princeton&quot; steamed west again for Pearl Harbor, where she rejoined the fast carriers of TF 50, now designated TF 58. On 19 January, she sortied with TG 58.4 for strikes at Wotje and Taroa (29–31 January) to support amphibious operations against Kwajalein and Majuro. Her planes photographed the next assault target, Eniwetok, 2 February and on 3 February returned on a more destructive assignment – the demolition of the airfield on Engebi. For three days the atoll was bombed and strafed. On 7 February, &quot;Princeton&quot; retired to Kwajalein, and the same day William H. Buracker took command. &quot;Princeton&quot; returned to Eniwetok on 10–13 and 16–28 February, when her planes softened the beaches for the invasion force, then provided air cover during the assault and ensuing fight.

From Eniwetok, &quot;Princeton&quot; retired to Majuro, thence to Espiritu Santo for replenishment. On 23 March, she got underway for strikes against enemy installation and shipping in the Carolines. After striking the Palaus, Woleai and Yap, the force replenished at Majuro and sortied again 13 April. Steaming to New Guinea, the carriers provided air cover for the Hollandia operation (21–29 April), then crossed back over the International Date Line to raid Truk (29–30 April) and Ponape (1 May).

On 11 May, &quot;Princeton&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor only to depart again on 29 May for Majuro. There she rejoined the fast carriers and pointed her bow toward the Marianas to support the assault on Saipan. From 11 to 18 June, she sent her planes against targets on Guam, Rota, Tinian, Pagan, and Saipan, then steamed west to intercept a Japanese fleet reported to be en route from the Philippines to the Marianas. In the ensuing Battle of the Philippine Sea, &quot;Princeton&quot; planes contributed 30 kills and her guns another three, plus one assist, to the devastating toll inflicted on Japan&#x27;s naval air arm.

Returning to the Marianas, &quot;Princeton&quot; again struck Pagan, Rota and Guam, then replenished at Eniwetok. On 14 July, she got underway again as the fast carriers returned their squadrons to the Marianas to furnish air cover for the assault and occupation of Guam and Tinian. On 2 August, the force returned to Eniwetok, replenished, then sailed for the Philippines. En route, her planes raided the Palaus, then on 9–10 September, struck airfields on northern Mindanao. On 11 September, they pounded the Visayas. At mid-month the force moved back over the Pacific chessboard to support the Palau offensive, then returned to the Philippines to hit Luzon, concentrating on Clark and Nichols fields. The force then retired to Ulithi, and in early October, bombed and strafed enemy airfields, installations and shipping in the Nansei Shoto and Formosa area in preparation for the invasion of the Philippines.

== Loss ==
On 20 October, landings were made at Dulag and San Pedro Bay, Leyte. &quot;Princeton&quot;, in Task Group 38.3, cruised off Luzon and sent her planes against airfields there to prevent Japanese land-based aircraft attacks on Allied ships massed in Leyte Gulf.

On 24 October, however, the task group was found by enemy planes from Clark and Nichols fields. Shortly before 10:00 a.m. &quot;Princeton&quot; was attacked by a lone Yokosuka D4Y &#x27;Judy&#x27;. The dive bomber dropped a single bomb, which struck the carrier between the elevators, punching through the wooden flight deck and hangar before exploding. Although structural damage was minor, a fire broke out and quickly spread owing to burning gasoline, causing further explosions.

Cruisers and destroyers came alongside to render assistance. approached and attempted to fight the fire in the forward section of the hangar deck. The cruiser , being the largest ship, took the lead role in fire fighting. During the operation, &quot;Princeton&quot; collided with and damaged the assisting ships.

At 15:24, a second and larger explosion shook the &quot;Princeton&quot;, possibly caused by an explosion of one or more bombs in the magazine. &quot;Birmingham&quot; suffered extensive damage to her superstructure and considerable casualties. &quot;Irwin&quot; was also damaged, but stayed close and launched boats to rescue survivors from the sea. &quot;Irwin&quot; rescued 646 crewmen from the &quot;Princeton&quot;; the ship later received a Navy Unit Commendation award for her actions.

Efforts to save the carrier continued, but by 16:00, the fires were out of control. The remaining personnel were evacuated, and shortly after 17:06, &quot;Irwin&quot; commenced firing torpedoes at the burning hulk. However, &quot;Irwin&quot; abandoned this effort due to torpedo malfunctions (her torpedo tubes possibly damaged in the collision with &quot;Princeton&quot;) that caused her torpedoes to circle back and almost hit her. , at 17:46, took over the task of scuttling &quot;Princeton&quot;. Three minutes later, an even larger explosion occurred on &quot;Princeton&quot;, destroying the entire forward section and sending flames and debris up to into the air. &quot;Princeton&quot; sank at approximately 17:50.

===Aftermath===
Casualties on &quot;Princeton&quot; herself were relatively light considering the intensity of her fires; 108 men (10 officers and 98 enlisted men) were lost, while 1,361 crewmen were rescued. &quot;Princeton&quot;&#x27;s Captain Buracker was later awarded the Purple Heart, Legion of Merit with the Combat &quot;V&quot;, and the Navy Cross for his actions during the sinking.

Casualties were much heavier aboard &quot;Birmingham&quot; which was devastated by secondary explosions aboard &quot;Princeton&quot; while fighting fires, with 241 killed and 412 wounded. Three other ships were more lightly damaged while assisting &quot;Princeton&quot;:

* : heavy topside damage, two 5 in., two 40 mm and two 20 mm guns lost.
* : foremast lost, portside smashed
* : forward 5 in. mounts and director out, starboard side smashed.
* : one 40 mm smashed.

Captain John M. Hoskins, who had been prospective commanding officer of CVL-23, was also rescued, but lost his right foot. He would later become the new commanding officer of the fifth , launched as a replacement in 1945.

&quot;Birmingham&quot;″s commanding officer Thomas Inglis said &quot;I should take the same actionproviding the same factors were involved and I had no crystal ball.&quot; By the end of 1945, he had been promoted to rear admiral and chief of Naval Intelligence. &quot;Birmingham&quot; earned a Navy Unit Commendation for her performance on 24 October 1944. According to a second hand account told by a &quot;Birmingham&quot; survivor, when the cruiser returned to port for repairs, the civilian workers brought in to clean up the ship before repairs allegedly refused to do the job due to the stench of rotting flesh, so naval enlisted men took over the job.

Lt. Robert G. Bradley was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his actions on &quot;Princeton&quot; on 24 October 1944. He was later the namesake of . &quot;Princeton&quot;″s executive officer Cdr. Joseph Nathaniel Murphy who assumed command was later awarded the Navy Cross for his tireless effort to save the ship and get the crew to safety.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Princeton&quot; earned nine battle stars during World War II.

In November 2004, the Princeton University Chapel rededicated a service flag that once flew on &quot;Princeton&quot;.

<text>Another Green World is the third solo studio album by English musician Brian Eno (mononymously credited as &quot;Eno&quot;), released by Island Records on 14 November 1975. The album marked a transition from the rock-based music of Eno&#x27;s previous releases towards his late 1970s ambient work. Only five of its fourteen tracks feature vocals, a contrast with his previous vocal albums.

Produced by Eno and Rhett Davies, it features contributions from a small core of musicians, including Robert Fripp (electric guitar), Phil Collins (drums), Percy Jones (fretless bass), and Rod Melvin (piano). John Cale plays viola on two tracks. Employing tactics derived from his Oblique Strategies cards for guidance, Eno and the backing lineup utilised a variety of unconventional recording techniques and instrumental approaches, reflected in unusual instrumental credits such as &quot;snake guitar&quot; and &quot;uncertain piano&quot;. The album&#x27;s cover art is a detail from British artist Tom Phillips&#x27; &quot;After Raphael&quot;.

Although the album received widespread critical acclaim, its only contemporary chart success was in New Zealand, where it reached #24. Contemporary reception has been similarly positive; several publications, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, have named the album among the greatest of the 1970s and of all time.

== Production ==

&quot;Another Green World&quot; was recorded at Island Studios in Notting Hill, London, in July and August 1975. Brian Eno originally viewed his new album as an experiment and entered the recording studio with nothing written or prepared. For the first four days in the studio, Eno failed to be productive. To look for new ideas, Eno turned to his Oblique Strategies cards and began coming up with new ideas, as he had done on his previous album &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)&quot;.

Some of the album credits for the instruments have fanciful names that describe the sound they make. The &quot;Castanet Guitars&quot; are electric guitars played with mallets, electronically treated to sound something like castanets. The &quot;Leslie piano&quot; is an acoustic piano fed through a Leslie speaker. Eno described the &quot;snake guitar&quot; and &quot;digital guitar&quot; thus: &quot;the kind of lines I was playing reminded me of the way a snake moves through the brush, a sort of speedy, forceful, liquid quality. Digital guitar is a guitar threaded through a digital delay but fed back on itself a lot so it makes this cardboard tube type of sound.&quot;

As on his previous two solo efforts, Eno had several guest musicians contributing to &quot;Another Green World&quot;, but also worked on more solo material. Seven songs on the album have Eno playing all the instruments himself, including keyboards, guitars and percussion. Among the guest musicians was Phil Collins, who had played drums on &quot;Tiger Mountain&quot; and got along with Eno, which led to calling him and his Brand X bandmate Percy Jones to play on &quot;Another Green World&quot;. On recording the album, Collins recalled:

[Eno] gave us all a bit of paper and we made lists from one to 15. Eno said &quot;No. 2, we all play a G; No. 7 we all play a C sharp&quot;; an so on. So it was like painting by numbers... [Eno] used to love me and Percy; we&#x27;d go in and run through our dictionary licks and he&#x27;d record them and make a loop of them.

Guitarist Robert Fripp, who had worked with Eno on &quot;(No Pussyfooting)&quot; and &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot;, performed the solo on &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;. Eno asked Fripp to improvise a fast guitar solo that would imitate an electrical charge in a Wimshurst high-voltage generator; this was credited as &quot;Wimshurst Guitar&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Another Green World&quot; represents a turning point in Eno&#x27;s musical career. While his previous albums had contained quirky rock songs, only five of the fourteen tracks on &quot;Another Green World&quot; have lyrics. Critic Ian Wade of &quot;The Quietus&quot; noted that the album is &quot;much calmer&quot; than Eno&#x27;s previous work, &quot;smoothed into a new pastoral ambient pop&quot;. Music critic Jim DeRogatis called it an &quot;ambient/art-pop classic&quot;. According to eMusic&#x27;s Richard Gehr, the album&#x27;s music veers from the guitar-oriented experimental rock of &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot; and &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain&quot; to the synthesiser-oriented ambient minimalism of his subsequent work. Its minimalist instrumentals are scattered among more structured art-rock songs. According to AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey, most of the album consists of &quot;paced instrumentals that, while often closer to ambient music than pop, are both melodic and rhythmic&quot;. The instrumental tracks mark a transition between Eno&#x27;s earlier rock songs and his later instrumental works in which texture and timbre are the most important musical elements. Dave Simpson described the album as creating a &quot;largely song-based electronic pop&quot;, while AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Ankeny described it as an art rock album.

&quot;Sky Saw&quot; opens the album with the instruments constantly changing structure, except for one of the two bass parts which plays the same pattern throughout. Eno later re-used portions of &quot;Sky Saw&quot; for a track on &quot;Music for Films&quot; in 1978 and a song on Ultravox&#x27;s 1977 debut album. &quot;Songs like &#x27;The Big Ship, writes Mike Powell, &quot;start on A and linger, accumulating countermelodies, magnifying themes, staying the same and yet revealing new sides with every turn.&quot; &quot;In Dark Trees&quot; and &quot;The Big Ship&quot; are two songs on which Eno plays all the instruments, namely the synthesizer, synthetic percussion and drum machine. These instrumental pieces and others like &quot;Little Fishes&quot; have been described as &quot;highly imagistic, like paintings done in sound that actually resemble their titles&quot;.

To create the lyrics, Eno would later play the backing tracks singing nonsense syllables to himself, which he would then form them into actual words and phrases. This lyric-writing method was used for all his vocal-based recordings of the 1970s. The tracks that do feature lyrics are in the same free-associative style as Eno&#x27;s previous albums, with a &quot;gently whimsical and addled&quot; sense of humour.

==Release and reception==
Released on Island Records 14 November 1975, &quot;Another Green World&quot; did not chart in either the United Kingdom or the United States. However, the album&#x27;s contemporary critical reception was mostly very positive. Henry Edwards of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; wrote positively of the album, claiming it to be Eno&#x27;s &quot;most accessible to date&quot;. Tom Hull of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; felt that, although it &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be fair to say that &quot;Another Green World&quot; is Eno&#x27;s best album&quot;, the album is definitely &quot;his easiest to love&quot;. Charley Walters of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found it a &quot;major triumph&quot; that Eno&#x27;s creative risks &quot;so consistently pan out&quot;, and said that it is &quot;indeed an important record—and also a brilliant one&quot;. Negative reviews of the album focused on the lack of the rock songs from Eno&#x27;s previous albums. Jon Pareles, writing in &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot;, found its electronic excursions less challenging than Eno&#x27;s previous progressive rock songs and remarked: &quot;This ain&#x27;t no Eno record. I don&#x27;t care what the credits say. It doesn&#x27;t even get on my nerves.&quot; Lester Bangs of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was lulled by much of the music and said that &quot;those little pools of sound on the outskirts of silence seemed to me the logical consequence of letting the processes and technology share your conceptual burden&quot;. Robert Christgau, who originally gave the album an &quot;A−&quot; in his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, admitted that he resisted the album at first, but ultimately grew to &quot;love every minute of this arty little collection of static (i.e., non-swinging) synthesizer pieces (with vocals, percussion, and guitar)&quot;. In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), he said that the record&#x27;s 14 pieces can be appreciated both individually and as a whole, calling the whole &quot;the aural equivalent of a park on the moon – oneness with nature under conditions of artificial gravity&quot;. In 1977, &quot;Another Green World&quot; was voted the 11th best album of 1976 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, ranked it second on his own list.

In 2004, Virgin Records began issuing remasters of Eno&#x27;s albums in digipaks. Modern reception of &quot;Another Green World&quot; has been more unanimously positive. Steve Huey of AllMusic called it &quot;a universally acknowledged masterpiece&quot; and &quot;the perfect introduction to [Eno&#x27;s] achievements even for those who find ambient music difficult to enjoy&quot;. Mike Powell of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; hailed it as Eno&#x27;s definitive album, and &quot;Q&quot; magazine wrote that it was &quot;breathtakingly ahead of its time&quot;. J. D. Considine, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), said that Eno used the recording studio for the album &quot;as an instrument, molding directed improvisations, electronic effects, and old-fashioned songcraft into perfectly balanced aural ecosystems&quot;. In his review for &quot;Blender&quot;, Douglas Wolk said that the audio clarity of the remastered edition &quot;makes it easier to pay attention to every [song&#x27;s] subtle complexities&quot;.

== Legacy ==

The album has made several top albums lists. Pitchfork placed the album at number ten on its list of greatest albums of the 1970s. In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 429 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and then at number 338 in the updated 2020 list. In 2003, &quot;Blender&quot; placed the album on its list of &quot;500 CDs You Must Own: Alternative Rock&quot;, calling it &quot;experimental yet accessible&quot; and &quot;exactly the kind of album that Eno devotees long for from him today&quot;.

An extract from the title track was used as the theme music for the BBC Two series &quot;Arena&quot;.

<text>Vous et Nous is the ninth album by experimental pop French musician Brigitte Fontaine and the seventh by Areski Belkacem, released in 1977 on the Saravah label. &quot;Vous et Nous&quot; is an avant-garde double album mixing a variety of instruments and vocal styles. The album uses synthesizer and drum machine on some songs. Other, more acoustic, songs show the Algerian/African influence that Fontaine and Areski were known for. The album was not well understood upon release, but in later years was championed by musicians such as Jim O&#x27;Rourke and Stereolab.

<text>Silver Pistol is an album by Brinsley Schwarz, released in 1972. It was the first album to include Ian Gomm.

==Critical reception==
AllMusic wrote: &quot;&quot;Silver Pistol&quot; isn&#x27;t the definitive pub rock album, but it is the first great record to surface from the scene. Like much of the first wave of pub rock, &quot;Silver Pistol&quot; is quiet, laid-back and low-key -- with its warm, rustic sound and a gentleness that infuses even the rockers, this is the closest to the Band that the Brinsleys got.&quot;

&quot;Record World&quot; said of the single &quot;Nightingale&quot; that &quot;this lilting
ballad is a perfect wedding of music and lyrics.&quot;

<text>Born to Run is the third studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen, released on August 25, 1975, by Columbia Records. Co-produced by Springsteen with his manager Mike Appel and the producer Jon Landau, its recording took place in New York. Following the commercial failures of his first two albums, the album marked Springsteen&#x27;s effort to break into the mainstream and create a commercially successful album. Springsteen sought to emulate Phil Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound production, leading to prolonged sessions with the E Street Band lasting from January 1974 to July 1975; six months alone were spent working on the title track. 

The album incorporates musical styles including rock and roll, pop rock, R&amp;B, and folk rock. Its character-driven lyrics describe individuals who feel trapped and fantasize about escaping to a better life, conjured via romantic lyrical imagery of highways and travel. Springsteen envisioned the songs taking place over one long summer day and night. They are also less tied to the New Jersey area than his previous work. The album cover, featuring Springsteen leaning on E Street Band saxophonist Clarence Clemons&#x27;s shoulder, is considered iconic and has been imitated by various musicians and in other media.

Supported by an expensive promotional campaign, &quot;Born to Run&quot; became a commercial success, reaching number three on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart and the top ten in three others. Two singles were released, &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot;, the first of which became a radio and live favorite. The album&#x27;s release generated extensive publicity, leading to backlash from critics who expressed skepticism over whether Springsteen&#x27;s newfound attention was warranted. Following its release, Springsteen became embroiled in legal issues with Appel, leading him to tour the United States and Europe for almost two years. Upon release, &quot;Born to Run&quot; received highly positive reviews. Critics praised the storytelling and music, although some viewed its production as excessive and heavy-handed. 

&quot;Born to Run&quot; was Springsteen&#x27;s breakthrough album. Its success has been attributed to capturing the ideals of a generation of American youths during a decade of political turmoil, war, and issues for the working class. Over the following decades, the album has become widely regarded as a masterpiece and one of Springsteen&#x27;s best records. It has appeared on various lists of the greatest albums of all time and was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; in 2003. &quot;Born to Run&quot; received an expanded reissue in 2005 to celebrate its 30th anniversary, featuring a concert film and a documentary detailing the album&#x27;s making.

==Development==
Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot; and &quot;The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle&quot;, were released in 1973 through Columbia Records. While the albums were critically acclaimed, both sold poorly. By 1974 his popularity was limited to the East Coast of the United States, and the label&#x27;s confidence in him began to wane. Management at Columbia had changed and they began to favor the then-upcoming artist Billy Joel. Low morale plagued Springsteen&#x27;s team, including both his manager, Mike Appel, and his backing group the E Street Band. After Springsteen rejected CBS Records&#x27; suggestion to record in Nashville, Tennessee with session musicians and a brought-in producer, the label agreed to finance one more album on the agreement that if it failed, they would drop him. Appel successfully negotiated a slightly larger budget for the album but limited recording to 914 Sound Studios in Blauvelt, New York, the studio Springsteen used for the recordings of his first two albums.
The phrase &quot;born to run&quot; came to Springsteen while lying in bed one night at his home in West Long Branch, New Jersey. He said the title &quot;suggested a cinematic drama I thought would work with the music I was hearing in my head&quot;. Inspired by the musical sounds and lyrical themes of 1950s and 1960s rock and roll artists such as Duane Eddy, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, Phil Spector, the Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan, Springsteen began composing what became &quot;Born to Run&quot;. He later wrote: &quot;This was the turning point. It proved to be the key to my songwriting for the rest of the record.&quot; He anticipated that sound he was seeking would be a &quot;studio production&quot;. The album became the first time Springsteen used the studio as an instrument rather than simply replicating the sound of live performances.

==Production history==
===914 Sound Studios===
The recording sessions for the album began at 914 Sound Studios in January 1974. Springsteen and Appel acted as co-producers; &quot;Greetings&quot; and &quot;Wild&quot; producer Jimmy Cretecos had departed Springsteen&#x27;s company in early 1974, citing low profits. Louis Lahav, the engineer from both albums, returned for these sessions. The members of the E Street Band were Clarence Clemons (saxophone), Danny Federici (organ), David Sancious (piano), Garry Tallent (bass), and Ernest Carter (drums); Carter had replaced Vini &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Lopez, whom Springsteen fired in February over poor personal behavior. The band went back and forth between studio recording and live concert performances. Springsteen used the latter to develop new material, and he spent more time in the studio refining songs than he had on the previous two albums. The album&#x27;s working titles included &quot;From the Churches to the Jails&quot;, &quot;The Hungry and the Hunted&quot;, &quot;War and Roses&quot;, and &quot;American Summer&quot;.

Recording for &quot;Born to Run&quot; lasted six months. Springsteen&#x27;s perfectionism led to grueling sessions: he obsessed over every syllable, note, and tone of every texture, and he struggled to capture the sounds he heard in his head on tape. His aim for a Phil Spector-type Wall of Sound production meant multiple instruments were assigned to each track on the studio&#x27;s 16-track mixing desk; each new overdub made the recording and mixing more difficult. As he kept rewriting the lyrics, Springsteen and Appel created several mixes containing electric and acoustic guitars, piano, organ, horns, synthesizers, and a glockenspiel, as well as strings and female backing vocalists. &quot;Born to Run&quot; reportedly had up to five different versions. According to Springsteen, the final song had 72 different tracks squeezed onto the 16 tracks of the mixing console. Springsteen was pleased with the final mix, completed in August 1974. CBS/Columbia refused to release &quot;Born to Run&quot; as an early single, wanting an album to promote it.
The same month &quot;Born to Run&quot; was completed, Sancious and Carter departed the E Street Band to form their own jazz-fusion band, Tone. They were replaced by Roy Bittan on piano and Max Weinberg on drums. Bittan had a background in symphony orchestras while Weinberg had experience with various rock bands and Broadway productions. Bittan had previously known of Springsteen&#x27;s music but Weinberg had not. The two meshed well with the rest of the band, offering new musical insights and relaxed personalities that eased tensions that had built up over years of recording and performing. On the album Bittan mostly replaced Federici, whose sole contribution was the organ part on &quot;Born to Run&quot;. Bittan later said he believed this was due to both men&#x27;s different performing styles and Bittan wanting to &quot;prove himself&quot; as a new member of the group.

Recording at 914 continued into late October 1974. The band made attempts at &quot;Jungleland&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;, &quot;Lovers in the Cold&quot;, &quot;Backstreets&quot;, and &quot;So Young and in Love&quot;, but faulty equipment and Springsteen&#x27;s lack of direction halted progress. The music critic Dave Marsh suggested that Springsteen remained at the subpar 914 Studios because studio costs built up, even though superior ones were available. In November, Appel sent &quot;Born to Run&quot; to various radio stations around the United States, which CBS executives viewed as professional misconduct. The stunt generated interest in the track and anticipation built toward the album&#x27;s release, prompting Columbia to fund further sessions. &quot;Born to Run&quot; became frequently requested on radio and at shows.

By January 1975, the band had been working for over a year with one finished track. Production continued to be plagued by faulty equipment, false starts, and Springsteen&#x27;s desire for more takes. A new track, &quot;Wings for Wheels&quot;, debuted live in February. Springsteen felt he lacked direction, and he requested production advice from the writer and producer Jon Landau, who had criticized the production on &quot;Wild&quot; in an article for &quot;The Real Paper&quot;. The two met in Boston in April 1974 and developed a close friendship after. In February 1975, Landau was invited to a session, where he suggested moving the saxophone solo on &quot;Wings for Wheels&quot; to the end rather than in the middle. Springsteen liked the change and hired Landau as co-producer of the album.

===Record Plant===
In March 1975, Landau moved the recording sessions from 914 to the superior Record Plant in Manhattan. Landau helped Springsteen regain focus and direction with a fresh perspective. Springsteen told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1975: &quot;[Landau] came up with the idea, &#x27;Let&#x27;s make a rock and roll record.&#x27; Things had fallen down internally. He got things on their feet again.&quot; Appel and Landau had disagreements on production choices, which Springsteen had to resolve. Like the band, the two helped Springsteen complete already devised ideas, not think of new ones. Louis Lahav was unavailable due to family commitments so these sessions were engineered by Jimmy Iovine. 

Sessions at the Record Plant lasted from March to July 1975. Apart from a few live performances, Springsteen spent most of these months working on the album. The sessions were grueling, dragging on despite increased professionalism brought by Landau and Iovine. While the backing tracks and vocals were recorded with little difficulty, Springsteen struggled with his overdubs and completing the writing of the lyrics and arrangements. Springsteen obsessively labored over and sometimes spent hours revising single lines or taking days to figure out the song arrangements. Springsteen later said: &quot;[The sessions] turned into something that was wrecking me, just pounding me into the ground.&quot; Weinberg called it the hardest project of his career, and Federici said &quot;[we] ate, drank, and slept [that album]&quot;. Work was mostly done between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m. the following morning.

&quot;Wings for Wheels&quot;, now called &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, was finished in April. Springsteen reportedly took 13 hours to complete his guitar parts. &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot; and &quot;Night&quot; followed in May. For &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot;, Springsteen hired the Brecker Brothers (Randy and Michael), David Sanborn, and Wayne Andre to play horn parts. Springsteen and Bittan failed to write proper horn parts by the time the players arrived to record, so Springsteen&#x27;s friend and former Steel Mill bandmate Steven Van Zandt conceived them on the spot in the studio. Van Zandt joined the E Street Band shortly after. Springsteen used lyrical ideas from &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot; to complete &quot;Backstreets&quot;, originally &quot;Hidin&#x27; on the River&quot;. &quot;Meeting Across the River&quot;, originally &quot;The Heist&quot;, featured Richard Davis on double bass. Davis had previously contributed to &quot;The Angel&quot; on &quot;Greetings&quot;. &quot;Jungleland&quot; featured violin from Suki Lahav, wife of Louis Lahav, and a long saxophone solo from Clemons, which he spent 16 hours replaying to Springsteen&#x27;s satisfaction; the latter dictated almost every note played. Clemons played several different solos, bits of which were then edited together into one piece; he then reproduced the final result.

===Mixing===
According to Iovine, the album was mixed in &quot;nine days straight&quot;. The final days were hectic; the band worked vigorously between recording for the album and rehearsing for an upcoming tour scheduled to start on July 20. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 autobiography &quot;Born to Run&quot;: &quot;In a three-day, 72-hour sprint, working in three studios simultaneously, Clarence and I finishing the &#x27;Jungleland&#x27; sax solo, phrase by phrase, in one, while we mixed &#x27;Thunder Road&#x27; in another, singing &#x27;Backstreets&#x27; in a third.&quot; Springsteen was demanding and refused to compromise, saying at the time that he could &quot;only hear the things that were wrong with it&quot;. Appel and Landau fought to keep certain tracks on the finished album. Appel succeeded in leaving &quot;Linda Let Me Be the One&quot; and &quot;Lonely Night in the Park&quot; off and keeping &quot;Meeting Across the River&quot; on. Mixing lasted until the morning of July 20, just before the tour began. 

&quot;Born to Run&quot; was mastered by the engineer Greg Calbi while the band were on the road. Springsteen was furious about the initial acetate, throwing it into the swimming pool of the hotel he was staying at. He contemplated scrapping the entire project and re-recording it live before he was stopped by Landau. Springsteen was sent multiple mixes as he was on the road and rejected all but one, which he approved in early August.

===Outtakes===
The seven known outtakes from the album are &quot;Linda Let Me Be the One&quot;, &quot;Lonely Night in the Park&quot;, &quot;A Love So Fine&quot;, &quot;A Night Like This&quot;, &quot;Janey Needs a Shooter&quot;, &quot;Lovers in the Cold&quot;, and &quot;So Young and in Love&quot;. &quot;Linda Let Me Be the One&quot; and &quot;So Young and in Love&quot; were released on the &quot;Tracks&quot; box set in 1998. Rough mixes of the unreleased songs &quot;Lovers in the Cold&quot; (&quot;Walking in the Street&quot;) and &quot;Lonely Night in the Park&quot; surfaced in 2005, when they made their debut on E Street Radio. &quot;Janey Needs a Shooter&quot; was later re-worked by Springsteen and Warren Zevon into the track &quot;Jeannie Needs a Shooter&quot; for Zevon&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School&quot;. A 2019 recording of the original &quot;Janey Needs a Shooter&quot; was released on Springsteen&#x27;s 2020 album &quot;Letter to You&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
The music on &quot;Born to Run&quot; includes styles such as rock and roll, pop rock, R&amp;B, and folk rock. The author Peter Ames Carlin states that the album captures &quot;the essence of fifties rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and the beatnik poetry of sixties folk-rock, projected onto the battered spirit of mid-seventies America&quot;. Springsteen wrote most of the songs on piano, which Kirkpatrick felt gave them &quot;a particular melodic feel&quot;. Springsteen later said Bittan&#x27;s piano &quot;really defined the sound&quot; of the album. The record&#x27;s production is similar to Phil Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound, in which layers of instruments and complex arrangements are combined to make each song resemble a symphony. Springsteen said that he wanted &quot;Born to Run&quot; to sound like &quot;Roy Orbison singing Bob Dylan, produced by Spector&quot;. He used Orbison&#x27;s style for his vocal delivery and Duane Eddy as inspiration for his guitar parts. The writer Frank Rose emphasized Springsteen&#x27;s homage to girl groups from the 1960s, such as the Shirelles, the Ronettes, and the Shangri-Las, ones who embellished themes of heartbreak and doo-wop sounds produced by Spector. The songs feature musical introductions that set the tone and scene for each.
Springsteen envisioned the album&#x27;s songs as taking place during one summer day and night. According to the writer Louis Masur, the album is centrally driven by &quot;loneliness and the search for companionship&quot;. The characters are regular people who are lost and feel trapped in their lives; different places, such as streets and roads, offer a way out but are not ideal places. Described by &quot;Treble&quot; Hubert Vigilla as a &quot;four corners approach&quot; to album sequencing, both sides of the original LP began with songs that were optimistic and promised hope and ended with songs of betrayal and pessimism. Across the album&#x27;s eight songs, Springsteen writes about the night and the city (&quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot;, &quot;Backstreets&quot;, and &quot;Meeting Across the River&quot;); an irresistible real or imaginary woman (&quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;); the enslavement of the working class (&quot;Night&quot;); and the highway as a means of escape and coming-of-age journey (&quot;Thunder Road&quot;, &quot;Born to Run&quot;, and &quot;Jungleland&quot;). The journalist Veronika Hermann noted the album is mostly driven by actions such as running, meeting, hiding, and driving.

&quot;Born to Run&quot; was written during a time when the idea of the American Dream was unobtainable to many Americans in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Watergate scandal, and the 1973 oil crisis. Carlin writes that Springsteen&#x27;s hopeful songs, containing ideals such as that a road can take you anywhere, were &quot;stunning&quot; during a period marked by assassinations, war, political corruption, and collapse of the hippie subculture. Hermann analyzed the lyrics as experiments in nostalgia, arguing that the &quot;heroes and heroines of &quot;Born to Run&quot; are facing the loss of security and stability, [and] facing the consequences of a lost war,&quot; leading to the choice to run away from the &quot;American dream&quot;. Springsteen worked a &quot;very, very long&quot; time writing the lyrics because he wanted to avoid tropes of &quot;classic rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll clichés&quot;, turning them instead into fully developed and emotional characters: &quot;It was the beginning of the creation of a certain world that all my others would refer back to, resonate off of, for the next 20 or 30 years.&quot; 

The songs are largely autobiographical, inspired by the noir-like B movies Springsteen enjoyed at the time; he wanted to experience and capture new ideals based on his life experiences at the time. Like his first two albums, &quot;Born to Run&quot; includes religious imagery, specifically the idea of &quot;searching&quot;, although it is undercut by a darker, apocalyptic landscape. Unlike &quot;Greetings&quot; and &quot;Wild&quot;, however, most of the songs on &quot;Born to Run&quot; are not specifically tied to New Jersey and New York, instead shifting to all of the United States in an attempt to be more accessible to a wider audience. Springsteen has said that &quot;most of the songs are about being nowhere&quot;.

===Side one===
&quot;Thunder Road&quot; is an invitation to travel on a long journey, taking inspiration from the 1958 film of the same name. The song&#x27;s narrator pleads with a romantic partner to join him in leaving their life behind to start anew, believing there is no time to wait and they must act now. Masur argues the song &quot;lays out hopes and dreams, and the remainder of the album is an investigation into whether, and in what ways, they can be realized&quot;. Kirkpatrick believes the track to be a rewritten version of &quot;Wild&quot; &quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)&quot; with a &quot;less innocent, more realistic perspective&quot;. Described by &quot;Billboard&quot; Kenneth Partridge as a &quot;five-minute pop opera&quot;, the music builds throughout the runtime; the instruments join in as the narrator&#x27;s vision solidifies. AllMusic&#x27;s James Gerard characterizes the tone as more melancholic than uplifting.
&quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot; follows a character named Bad Scooter who is &quot;searching for his groove&quot; and &quot;a place to fit in&quot;. Part autobiographical and part mythological, the song tells Springsteen and the E Street Band&#x27;s story as they struggle to find commercial success up to that point; they find success after the &quot;Big Man&quot; (Clemons on saxophone) joins the band in the third verse. Musically, it is a funky R&amp;B song led by brass horns; the authors Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon compared it to the sound of a Stax record. In his 2003 book &quot;Songs&quot;, Springsteen described &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot; as a &quot;band bio and block party&quot;.

&quot;Night&quot;, the shortest song on the album, follows a man who is a slave to the working life. He dreads working his nine-to-five job, but his love for drag racing motivates him to work so he can live for the night. Similar to other album tracks, it uses the highway as a means for escape. Musically, the song contains various minor and major key shifts in the music; Masur argues the minor key &quot;condemns the monotonous world of daytime work&quot; and the major key &quot;offers the possibilities of screeching off into the night&quot;. Margotin and Guesdon highlight the wall of sound production and compare its rock-and-roll sound to Chuck Berry.

&quot;Backstreets&quot; features a long piano-led intro. Described by Masur as &quot;operatic and theatrical&quot;, the band took inspiration from various Dylan and Orbison songs for the instrumental parts. The song tells the story of the narrator&#x27;s friendship with an individual named Terry, using both realistic and poetic imagery. The two become close until their relationship is broken after Terry leaves the narrator for someone else, after which the narrator &quot;reflects that he and Terry did not turn out to be the heroes &#x27;we thought we had to be″&quot;. Terry&#x27;s gender is unclear, leading some reviewers to interpret the relationship as homosexual. The song contains autobiographical elements related to Springsteen&#x27;s youth, with cinematic references.

===Side two===

&quot;Born to Run&quot; uses the automobile as a means to escape from a depressing life. The characters, described as &quot;tramps&quot;, include the narrator and a girl named Wendy. The former works a dreary job, &quot;sweating out&quot; the &quot;runaway American dream&quot;, and joins a car community at night. He tells Wendy the town they live in is a &quot;death trap&quot; and they need to leave &quot;while [they&#x27;re] young&quot; because &quot;tramps like us... were born to run&quot;. Reviewers have analyzed the song&#x27;s anthemic message as containing both an &quot;underlying sadness&quot; and &quot;a feeling of desperation&quot;, as the narrator promises Wendy they will one day reach the promised land, but he does not know when. He simply wants to run away with her to &quot;help him discover if his youthful notions of love are real&quot;, and &quot;pledges his desire to die with her in the street&quot; and love her &quot;with all the madness in [his] soul&quot;. The song&#x27;s music combines rock and roll and hard rock with rockabilly, jazz, and Tin Pan Alley, complete with a Wall of Sound production. AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Ankeny described the song as &quot;a celebration of the rock &amp; roll spirit, capturing the music&#x27;s youthful abandon, delirious passion, and extraordinary promise with cinematic exhilaration&quot;.
&quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot; is about the narrator&#x27;s complete obsession for a girl. The girl, however, is a liar and bad for him, yet he keeps returning to her. Springsteen never revealed the song&#x27;s inspiration, although Margotin and Guesdon suggest it was Karen Darvin, Springsteen&#x27;s girlfriend at the time. The song musically incorporates a Bo Diddley beat. The jazzy &quot;Meeting Across the River&quot; musically and lyrically departs from the previous songs, utilizing piano and trumpet to create what Margotin and Guesdon describe as a &quot;film noir jazz ambience&quot; that &quot;clashes with the other tracks&quot;. In it, the narrator and his partner Eddie are small-time gangsters who plan an illegal deal across the Hudson River, striving for a big score that will earn him a large amount of money to impress his girlfriend. With themes of despair and hopelessness, the song ends before a narrative resolution, leaving whether or not the gangsters succeeded ambiguous.

&quot;Jungleland&quot; takes place in the titular location, where a meeting between gang members at midnight is interrupted by the police. With a dark atmosphere, the track observes a New Jersey gang member known as the Magic Rat, who escapes law enforcement in Harlem with his unnamed partner referred to as the &quot;barefoot girl&quot;. Towards the end, the Rat and the girl&#x27;s relationship has broken apart; she leaves him, and he is killed in the streets. The Rat is gunned down by his &quot;own dream&quot;, symbolizing, in Masur&#x27;s words, that &quot;the runaway American dream will kill us in the end, and the dream of escape is just another version that entraps us&quot;. Following his demise, destruction continues across the streets until they are left in complete devastation. Over nine minutes in length, the track is led by Springsteen&#x27;s vocal, Bittan&#x27;s piano, and Suki Lahav&#x27;s violin, and features an extended saxophone solo from Clemons that lasts for over two minutes.
==Artwork and packaging==

The cover art of &quot;Born to Run&quot; was taken by the photographer Eric Meola at his personal studio on June 20, 1975. Springsteen&#x27;s busy recording schedule meant he kept missing shooting dates. When he finally showed up, he brought Clemons, whom he wanted on the cover. Meola shot 900 frames in the three-hour session, some of which showed Springsteen under a fire escape, tuning a radio, and with a guitar; unused shots were used by Columbia for advertising.

In the chosen black-and-white shot, Springsteen is holding a guitar while leaning against Clemons. Springsteen is wearing a black leather jacket, and Clemons is in a white shirt with a striped pattern and wearing a black hat. Meola said the shot was a clear standout: &quot;I wanted something that was nearly impossible to print, but beautiful to look at if printed perfectly—somehow innocent yet street-smart.&quot; An Elvis Presley pin appears on Springsteen&#x27;s guitar strap, which he wore to display Presley&#x27;s inspiration on him as a musician. His guitar, a Fender Telecaster with an Esquire neck, later appeared on the covers of &quot;Live 1975–85&quot; (1986), &quot;Human Touch&quot; (1992), and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1995). The &quot;Born to Run&quot; cover was included in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers&#x27; poll of the best album covers of all time in 2011. Masur called it &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;one of the most iconic images in rock history&quot;.

The image covers both sides of the LP sleeve; the inside features lyrics and a portrait of Springsteen. Columbia&#x27;s art director John Berg created the fold-over sleeve, and Andy Engel was responsible for the typography. Berg stated that &quot;it probably took a week of negotiating&quot; with the label to create the fold-over cover because &quot;it was breaking the code; we didn&#x27;t do that unless we had two records&quot;. Landau&#x27;s name was misspelled as &quot;John&quot; instead of &quot;Jon&quot; on the initial pressings; Columbia printed stickers to cover up the error—reportedly up to 400,000. A few original pressings have &quot;Meeting Across the River&quot; billed under its initial title &quot;The Heist&quot;, and the original album cover has the title handwritten with a broad-nib pen. These copies, known as the &quot;script cover&quot;, are very rare and among the most sought after of Springsteen memorabilia.

Springsteen and Clemons occasionally remade the cover pose onstage during their concerts. The pose has since been imitated by other singers and musicians, including Cheap Trick on the 1983 album &quot;Next Position Please&quot;, Mai Kuraki on the cover of her 2001 single &quot;Stand Up&quot;, Tom and Ray Magliozzi on the cover of the 2003 &quot;Car Talk&quot; compilation &quot;Born Not to Run: More Disrespectful Car Songs&quot;, and Los Secretos for their 2015 album &quot;Algo prestado&quot;. Outside of music, the webcomic strip &quot;Kevin and Kell&quot; imitated the pose on a Sunday strip entitled &quot;Born to Migrate&quot;, featuring Kevin Dewclaw as Springsteen with a carrot and Kell Dewclaw as Clemons with a pile of bones, and the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters Bert and the Cookie Monster imitated the pose on the cover of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; album &quot;Born to Add&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
Springsteen and the E Street Band went on a tour of the U.S. East Coast on July 20, 1975, immediately after mixing on &quot;Born to Run&quot; was completed; Springsteen approved the final master recording while on the road. The tour continued into August, including an all sold-out five-night, ten-show stint at the Bottom Line nightclub in Greenwich Village. Columbia purchased one-fifth of the venue tickets for rock journalists and media for promotion. Expectations were high. Clemons remembered: &quot;We were right on the verge. If we had flopped at the Bottom Line, it would have been very detrimental to us emotionally.&quot; The shows were a major success, receiving praise from both critics and from Columbia&#x27;s former president Clive Davis. Kirkpatrick stated they &quot;showed rock fans and media alike that Springsteen was no creation of industry hype; he was the real deal&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; later included the shows in a 1987 list chronicling 20 concerts that changed rock and roll.

&quot;Born to Run&quot; was accompanied by a $250,000 promotional campaign by Columbia/CBS, directed at both consumers and the music industry, led by the executive Glen Brunman. In the buildup to the album&#x27;s release, CBS spent $40,000 on advertisements that utilized Springsteen&#x27;s first two albums and Landau&#x27;s &quot;I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen&quot; quote, which had been published in &quot;The Real Paper&quot; after Landau witnessed Springsteen perform &quot;Born to Run&quot; for the first time live in May 1975. The ads increased sales of both albums significantly enough to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, barely above number 60, two years after their original releases. Preorders for &quot;Born to Run&quot; were upwards of 350,000 units, more than twice the sales of &quot;Greetings&quot; and &quot;Wild&quot; combined.

Released on August 25, 1975, &quot;Born to Run&quot; peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, topped the &quot;Record World&quot; chart and reached number 36 on the U.K. Albums Chart. Elsewhere, &quot;Born to Run&quot; reached number 7 in Australia, the Netherlands, and Sweden, 20 in Ireland, 26 in Norway, 28 in New Zealand, and 31 in Canada. By the end of 1975, it had sold 700,000 copies. By 2022, &quot;Born to Run&quot; was certified seven times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the U.S. The album was supported by two singles. The first, &quot;Born to Run&quot; with &quot;Meeting Across the River&quot; as the B-side, was released on August 25, 1975, reached number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and proved popular with radio stations and live audiences. The second, &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot; backed by &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;, appeared in January 1976 and reached number 83.

===Media hype and backlash===
The album was highly anticipated and publicized. In October 1975, Springsteen became the first artist to appear on the covers of the magazines &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; simultaneously. &quot;Time&quot; Jay Cocks focused on him as an artist, while &quot;Newsweek&quot; Maureen Orth focused on Columbia&#x27;s promotional campaign and the hype surrounding Springsteen, insisting that he was an industry-made pop star.

The question of hype became a story in itself, as critics wondered if Springsteen was legitimate or the product of record company promotion. The journalist John Sinclair of the &quot;Ann Arbor Sun&quot; claimed that Dave Marsh and Jon Landau were &quot;co-conspirators on a massive Springsteen hype&quot;. Examinations on the hype continued after the album&#x27;s release with articles by &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; and England&#x27;s &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, the latter arguing that Springsteen was &quot;no hype&quot; at all because he &quot;is really good&quot;, and hype&#x27; only services artists who do not deserve the attention&quot;. In retrospect, Masur stated: &quot;Most of the backlash against Springsteen came in the form of disgust with the hype, not the music, even though writing about the hype only fed the publicity machine.&quot; 

Springsteen was hurt by the media backlash, particularly an article by Henry Edwards in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that slandered both himself and &quot;Born to Run&quot;. He felt that the publicity got out of his control and Columbia&#x27;s campaign that labeled him the future of rock and roll was a mistake. He also reportedly felt a loss of innocence after the album&#x27;s release, claiming to have reached a low point in the immediate months. When the backlash subsided, sales tapered off and &quot;Born to Run&quot; was off the chart after 29 weeks. In his 1999 book &quot;Flowers in the Dustbin&quot;, former &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; writer James Miller wrote that the &quot;mass-marketing&quot; of Springsteen in the U.S. and David Bowie&#x27;s Ziggy Stardust in the U.K. led to the notion that &quot;the age of innocence in rock was well and truly over—probably forever&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Born to Run&quot; received highly positive reviews from music critics, particularly for its cinematic storytelling and Wall of Sound production. Greil Marcus wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that Springsteen enhances romanticized American themes with his majestic sound, ideal style of rock and roll, evocative lyrics, and an impassioned delivery that defines a &quot;magnificent&quot; album. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John Rockwell described &quot;Born to Run&quot; as a masterpiece of &quot;punk poetry&quot; and &quot;one of the great records of recent years&quot;. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau felt that Springsteen condenses a significant amount of American myth into songs, and often succeeds in spite of his tendency for histrionics and &quot;pseudotragic beautiful loser fatalism&quot;.
Several critics expected &quot;Born to Run&quot; to lead to Springsteen crossing over into mainstream success. Reviewers praised the vocal performances, music, and production. Compared to Springsteen&#x27;s earlier albums, critics felt the lyrics were more accessible and possessed a &quot;universal quality that transcends the sources and myths he drew upon&quot;. Lester Bangs remarked in &quot;Creem&quot; that he is &quot;no longer cramming as many syllables as possible into every line&quot;. The performances of the E Street Band were also highlighted, particularly Clemons.

Some critics, including Bangs and Cocks, hailed Springsteen as a visionary destined to save the rock genre from, in Stephen Holden&#x27;s words, &quot;its present state of enervation&quot;. Bangs said Springsteen &quot;reminds us what it&#x27;s like to love rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll like you just discovered it, and then seize it and make it your own with certainty and precision&quot;. Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called &quot;Born to Run&quot; an &quot;essential&quot; album, stating: &quot;It has been a long time since anyone in rock has put so much passion and ambition in an album.&quot; In &quot;Circus Raves&quot;, Holden placed &quot;Born to Run&quot; amongst the decade&#x27;s great albums with &quot;Layla&quot; (1970), &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; (1971), and &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; (1972), and David McGee placed Springsteen amongst rock greats such as Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan.

&quot;Born to Run&quot; received negative reviews from a few critics, who found the production excessive and &quot;heavy-handed&quot;, the songs &quot;formulaic&quot;, &quot;an effusive jumble&quot; and &quot;undistinguished&quot;, and felt Springsteen himself lacked a definitive vocal personality. Langdon Winner argued in &quot;The Real Paper&quot; that, because Springsteen consciously adheres to traditions and standards extolled in rock criticism, &quot;Born to Run&quot; is &quot;the complete monument to rock and roll orthodoxy&quot;. Mike Jahn of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; complained about the songwriting, believing Springsteen was becoming typecast as a &quot;character composer&quot; after three albums. Roy Carr of the &quot;NME&quot; unfavorably compared Springsteen to David Bowie, believing he lacked the latter&#x27;s &quot;breath of vision&quot;. Carr also found the music uninspired and argued Springsteen himself &quot;often tries too hard, going right over the top on many occasions as a result&quot;. More moderately, Jerry Gilbert of &quot;Sounds&quot; believed &quot;Born to Run&quot; was not as &quot;essential&quot; as &quot;Greetings&quot; and &quot;Wild&quot;, but had enough &quot;distinction&quot; from the two albums to stand on its own: &quot;I have grown to love it but newcomers to Bruce&#x27;s music would be better advised to check out what the critics have been raving about in the past. Old fans will need to persevere.&quot;

&quot;Born to Run&quot; was voted the third best album of 1975 in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual critics poll run by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, behind Bob Dylan and the Band&#x27;s &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot; and Patti Smith&#x27;s &quot;Horses&quot;. Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, ranked it 12th on his own year-end list.

==Tours and Appel lawsuit==
Springsteen and the E Street Band—Bittan, Clemons, Federici, Tallent, Weinberg, and Van Zandt—continued touring the U.S. throughout the remainder of 1975 to promote &quot;Born to Run&quot;, performing to larger audiences following the album&#x27;s success. In mid-November, the band traveled to Europe to perform their first shows outside North America.

The first gigs were two performances at the Hammersmith Odeon in London. Springsteen was displeased with the venue&#x27;s advertisements, personally tearing down the lobby posters and ordered the buttons with Landau&#x27;s &quot;future of rock and roll&quot; quote printed on them not be given out. The first show drew mixed reviews from British reviewers. While his stage presence was positively received, others noted the difference in British and American cultures equated to poor audience responses. Springsteen thought the show was a disaster. Upon their return to the U.S., the band played five sold-out shows at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia at the end of December.

By 1976, Springsteen had disagreements with Appel over the direction of his career; Appel wanted to capitalize on &quot;Born to Run&quot; success with a live album, while Springsteen wanted to return to the studio with Landau. Springsteen was also concerned with the lack of personal revenue given the album&#x27;s success. Realizing that the terms of his record contract were unfavorable, he sued Appel in July 1976 for ownership of his work. The resulting legal proceedings prevented him from recording in a studio for almost a year, during which he continued touring with the E Street Band. The second leg of the Born to Run Tour, nicknamed the Chicken Scratch tour, ran from March to May throughout the American South.

Springsteen wrote new material on the road and at his farm home in Holmdel, New Jersey, reportedly amassing between 40 and 70 songs. He continued performing for nine months between August 1976 and May 1977, dubbed the Lawsuit tour, debuting new songs such as &quot;Something in the Night&quot; and &quot;The Promise&quot; that became live favorites. The lawsuit reached a settlement on May 28, 1977; Springsteen bought out his contract with Appel, who received a lump sum and a share of royalties from the first three albums. Springsteen and the band immediately entered the studio to record the follow-up to &quot;Born to Run&quot; at the start of June, with Landau co-producing. The recording sessions lasted nine months as Springsteen demanded perfection from the musicians and moved between different studios. The album, &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot;, was finally released in June 1978, three years after &quot;Born to Run&quot;.

==Legacy==
The success of &quot;Born to Run&quot; saved Springsteen&#x27;s career and launched him to stardom. The album established a solid national fan base for Springsteen, which he built on with each subsequent release. According to Kirkpatrick, it &quot;not only gave Springsteen his first hit record, it transformed seventies rock music while pushing the boundaries of what a singer-songwriter could achieve within the rock genre&quot;. Hilburn and Carlin compare &quot;Born to Run&quot; to albums that &quot;established a sound and identity powerful enough to permanently alter the perceptions of those who heard it&quot;, including Elvis Presley&#x27;s first album (1956) and &quot;The Sun Sessions&quot; (1976), the Beatles&#x27; American debut &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; (1964), Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; (1965) and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; (1966), and Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; (1991). Some critics argued &quot;Born to Run&quot; represented an amalgamation of the previous two decades of rock and roll that would push the next two decades of rock and beyond forward. In a 2005 article in &quot;Treble&quot;, Hubert Vigilla referred to the album as &quot;the Great American Rock and Roll Record&quot;.

Springsteen and the E Street Band have performed &quot;Born to Run&quot; in its entirety on several occasions, including at the Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, New Jersey, on May 7, 2008, at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, on September 20, 2009, and other shows on the fall 2009 leg of the Working on a Dream Tour. It was also partly or entirely performed on certain shows of the 2013 Wrecking Ball World Tour. The full album was again performed on June 20, 2013, at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry, England, and dedicated to the memory of the actor James Gandolfini, who had died of a heart attack the previous day.

===Analysis===
The success of &quot;Born to Run&quot; was tied to the fears of growing old held by a generation of late teenagers. Having missed the 1950s beat era and 1960s civil rights and anti-war movements, teenagers in the mid-1970s felt disconnected in an era of political turmoil with the Vietnam War and the resignation of president Richard Nixon. The decade was also plagued by stagflation that affected working class Americans, resulting in the loss of the American dream for many. Commentators note that &quot;Born to Run&quot; collectively captured the ideals of an entire generation of American youths and &quot;spoke to the cultural shift&quot; between the 1960s and 1970s. Joshua Zeitz of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; summarized: &quot;Springsteen embodied the lost &#x27;70s—the tense, political, working-class rejection of America&#x27;s limitations.&quot; &quot;Far Out&quot; Tim Coffman argued that Springsteen effectively embodied what it meant to be &quot;a down-and-out working-class kid in America, dreaming of a better life&quot;. Springsteen himself stated in 2005:

===Retrospective reviews===

Retrospective reviewers consider &quot;Born to Run&quot; a masterpiece and one of Springsteen&#x27;s best works. It has been described as a timeless record that set the stage for a career marked by a signature, distinctive sound and lyrics detailing aspirations towards the American dream. Further praise was given to the instrumentation between Springsteen and the E Street Band, and for its improvements over its predecessor, &quot;Wild&quot;. Lou Thomas of BBC Music described the album as &quot;a classic, honest musical expression of hope, dreams and survival&quot;. Another writer from &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Michael Hann, said &quot;Born to Run&quot; was &quot;the album where Springsteen starts to make the transition from a musician to an idea, a representation of a set of personal and musical values&quot;.

Despite its acclaim, &quot;Born to Run&quot; has attracted negative attention from writers who feel the production is &quot;too overblown&quot;, and presents Springsteen as &quot;more of a synthesist than an innovator&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann conversely argues that &quot;to call [the album] overblown is to miss the point&quot;, as doing so was Springsteen&#x27;s intention, concluding that &quot;it declared its own greatness with songs and a sound that lived up to Springsteen&#x27;s promise&quot;. In a later piece for &quot;Blender&quot; magazine, Christgau wrote that the record&#x27;s major flaw was its pompous declaration of greatness, typified by elements such as the &quot;wall-of-sound, white-soul-at-the-opera-house&quot; aesthetic and an &quot;unresolved quest narrative&quot;. Nonetheless, he maintained &quot;Born to Run&quot; was important for how &quot;its class-conscious songcraft provided a relief from the emptier pretensions of late-hippie arena-rock&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; writer Christopher John Stephens argued the album&#x27;s strengths can be viewed as its weaknesses.

===Rankings===
&quot;Born to Run&quot; has frequently appeared on lists of the greatest albums of the 1970s and of all time. &quot;NME&quot; Matthew Taub argued that &quot;Born to Run&quot; is &quot;probably the single best rock album of the 1970s, and easily one of the finest ever recorded&quot;. &quot;American Songwriter&quot; included it in a 2023 list compiling 10 albums that shaped the 1970s music landscape. In 1987, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 8 in a list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years&quot; and in 2003, the magazine ranked it 18th on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revision and dropping a few slots to number 21 in the 2020 reboot of the list. In 2000, NPR included &quot;Born to Run&quot; in a list compiling the 100 most important albums in the 20th century. A year later, the TV network VH1 named it the 27th-greatest album of all time, and in 2003, it was ranked as the most popular album of all time in the first Zagat Survey Music Guide. The album was also voted number 20 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000), and was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2006). In Apple Music&#x27;s 2024 list of the 100 Best Albums, the album ranked number 22.

In 2003, &quot;Born to Run&quot; was added to the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In December 2005, U.S. New Jersey representative Frank Pallone and 21 co-sponsors sponsored H.Res. 628, a bill that would have celebrated the 30th anniversary of &quot;Born to Run&quot; and Springsteen&#x27;s overall career. In general, resolutions honoring native sons are passed with a simple voice vote. The bill failed upon referral to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.

==Reissues==

&quot;Born to Run&quot; was reissued in 1977, 1980, and 1993. On November 15, 2005, Columbia reissued the album as an expanded box set to mark the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Titled the &quot;30th Anniversary Edition&quot;, the package included a remastered CD version of the original album, and a DVD containing a documentary on the making of the album called &quot;Wings for Wheels&quot;, and a concert film of Springsteen and the E Street Band at the Hammersmith Odeon in London on November 18, 1975. &quot;Wings for Wheels&quot; features interviews with Springsteen and the E Street Band members, with a bonus film of a 1973 performance in Los Angeles. The &quot;30th Anniversary Edition&quot; received critical acclaim, with several praising the remastered sound. &quot;Wings for Wheels&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in 2007.

In 2014, a new remaster by the engineer Bob Ludwig was included in &quot;The Album Collection Vol. 1 1973–1984&quot;, a box set composed of remastered editions of Springsteen&#x27;s first seven albums. All seven albums were released separately as single discs for Record Store Day in 2015.

<text>Buffalo Springfield Again is the second album by Buffalo Springfield, released on Atco Records in October 1967. The album features some of the group&#x27;s best-known songs, including &quot;Mr. Soul&quot;, &quot;Bluebird&quot;, &quot;Expecting to Fly&quot; and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Woman&quot;, all of which were released as singles. In contrast to the band&#x27;s hastily made debut album, recording for &quot;Again&quot; took place over a protracted nine-month span and was fraught with dysfunction, with each member eventually producing his own material largely independent of one another.

The album was a moderate commercial success, peaking at number 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, and came to be regarded by many rock critics as a classic of the psychedelic era. In 2003, the album was ranked number 188 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list. The album was included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings—published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981)—and in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It was voted number 165 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; in 2000.

==Background==
Several factors may have contributed to the slow pace of the recording sessions, including that bassist Bruce Palmer had been deported in January and had re-entered the United States illegally to continue working with the band, and guitarist Neil Young had quit and rejoined the group on several occasions, notably absent for the band&#x27;s appearance at the famed Monterey Pop Festival where David Crosby substituted in his place at the request of guitarist Stephen Stills.

The album features the first recordings of songs written by guitarist Richie Furay, who had not contributed any material to the band&#x27;s debut album. Also unlike the previous record, which had been recorded in its entirety by the band proper, session musicians appeared on various tracks as indicated on the album&#x27;s inner sleeve. Palmer&#x27;s deportation issues necessitated the contributions of outside bass players. During one of the times that Young had left the band, he had booked a studio to record &quot;Expecting to Fly,&quot; with session musicians under the impression it was for a Neil Young solo project rather than for Buffalo Springfield. Phil Spector Wrecking Crew associate Jack Nitzsche provided the musical arrangements for &quot;Expecting to Fly&quot;; it does not feature any members of the Springfield. Nitzsche would continue to work with Young through the early 1970s on both his solo debut album and his best-selling &quot;Harvest&quot;, also becoming a member of Young&#x27;s backing bands Crazy Horse and The Stray Gators.

The album includes an early country rock track by Furay, &quot;A Child&#x27;s Claim to Fame.&quot; The track &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Woman&quot; allegedly includes vocals by Crosby, who also allegedly had a hand in its composition; whether true or not, Stills acknowledges the genesis of the song was from jamming with Crosby. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said of &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Woman&quot; that it&#x27;s a &quot;mid-tempo rock ballad&quot; and that &quot;throaty vocals with a shimmering group backing are spiced with some outstanding guitar showing.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; called &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Woman&quot; an &quot;imaginative, different rock song.&quot; Young&#x27;s extended piece &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; begins with audience applause (taken not from a Buffalo Springfield show, but rather from a concert by the Beatles) and the opening of &quot;Mr. Soul&quot; (which opens the album) recorded live in the studio. The back cover of the album includes a lengthy list of people thanked as influence and inspiration, some of whom are musicians who contributed but were unaccredited. The album is dedicated to Barry Friedman, and listed as a York/Pala production. The album was remastered for compact disc in HDCD and reissued on June 24, 1997.

<text>″Til Shiloh is the fourth album by Jamaican dancehall artist Buju Banton, released in 1995 by Loose Cannon Records, a short-lived subsidiary of Island Records. In 2019 the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

The album marked a significant change in Banton&#x27;s artistry, going to a direction closer to roots reggae. &quot;″Til Shiloh&quot; was widely acclaimed by critics, and is considered to be a classic album for reggae music.

== Music and lyrics ==

&quot;″Til Shiloh&quot; was described as an introspective record. Its themes mainly explore Buju&#x27;s then newfound faith in the Rastafari movement, with songs such as &quot;Til I&#x27;m Laid to Rest&quot;, and &quot;Untold Stories&quot;. This could be seen as a transition from the rude-bwoy style, made of glorifications of gun violence, to a more roots-oriented fashion. Jo-Ann Greene of AllMusic said that the album &quot;consolidated his move into social awareness and adopted a more mature, reflective tone that signaled Banton&#x27;s arrival as an artist able to make major creative statements&quot;.

The title track, which opened the album, was based on an introduction Banton had used in live shows. According to producer Donovan Germain, Til Shiloh mean forever.&quot;

The track &quot;Untold Stories&quot; was later covered by Sinéad O&#x27;Connor on her 2005 reggae album &quot;Throw Down Your Arms&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Angus Taylor of BBC Music commented that &quot;this is a very listenable landmark, which reminds us that while lyrical topics may differ, musically, reggae is one&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s reviewer Jo-Ann Greene said that &quot;this is a gentler album than its predecessor, although still very much in a dancehall style. Another masterpiece&quot;. Robert Christgau stated that the record is &quot;The most fully accomplished reggae album since the prime of Black Uhuru&quot;, praising &quot;how he perfectly articulates empathy, vulnerability, and concern&quot;.

The album was listed in the 1999 book &quot;The Rough Guide: Reggae: 100 Essential CDs&quot;.

== Reissues ==
In 2002 the album an expanded and remastered edition was released on Island/IDJMG/Universal Records, featuring the tracks &quot;Sensemilia Persecution&quot; and &quot;Rampage&quot;.

In 2020, the album was reissued on its 25th anniversary on December 18, including remixes of &quot;Not an Easy Road&quot;, &quot;Wanna Be Loved&quot; and an unreleased track called &quot;Come Inna The Dance&quot; as bonus tracks.

==Commercial performance==
On the issue dated August 5, 1995, &quot;Til Shiloh&quot; debuted at number 148 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The album also debuted at number 27 on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for streams and sales equating to 500,000 units in the United States.

<doc id="202475" wikidata="Q354867" url="?curid=202475" title="Alan Watts">
<text>Alan Wilson Watts (6 January 1915 – 16 November 1973) was a British and American writer, speaker, and self-styled &quot;philosophical entertainer&quot;, known for interpreting and popularising Buddhist, Taoist, and Hindu philosophy for a Western audience.

Watts gained a following while working as a volunteer programmer at the KPFA radio station in Berkeley, California. He wrote more than 25 books and articles on religion and philosophy, introducing the Beat Generation and the emerging counterculture to &quot;The Way of Zen&quot; (1957), one of the first best selling books on Buddhism. In &quot;Psychotherapy East and West&quot; (1961), he argued that psychotherapy could become the West&#x27;s way of liberation if it discarded dualism, as the Eastern ways do. He considered &quot;Nature, Man and Woman&quot; (1958) to be, &quot;from a literary point of view—the best book I have ever written&quot;. He also explored human consciousness and psychedelics in works such as &quot;The New Alchemy&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Joyous Cosmology&quot; (1962).

His lectures found posthumous popularity through regular broadcasts on public radio, especially in California and New York, and more recently on the internet, on sites and apps such as YouTube and Spotify.

==Early years==
Watts was born to middle-class parents in Chislehurst, Kent (now south-east London), on 6 January 1915, living at Rowan Tree Cottage, 3 (now 5) Holbrook Lane. Watts&#x27;s father, Laurence Wilson Watts, was a representative for the London office of the Michelin tyre company. His mother, Emily Mary Watts (née Buchan), was a housewife whose father had been a missionary. With little money, they chose to live in the countryside, and Watts, an only child, learned the names of wild flowers and butterflies. Probably because of the influence of his mother&#x27;s religious family the Buchans, Watts became interested in spirituality. Watts was interested in storybook fables and romantic tales of the mysterious Far East. He attended The King&#x27;s School Canterbury where he was a contemporary and friend of Patrick Leigh Fermor.

Watts later wrote of a mystical dream he experienced while ill with a fever as a child. During this time he was influenced by Far Eastern landscape paintings and embroideries that had been given to his mother by missionaries returning from China. The few Chinese paintings Watts was able to see in England riveted him, and he wrote &quot;I was aesthetically fascinated with a certain clarity, transparency, and spaciousness in Chinese and Japanese art. It seemed to float...&quot; These works of art emphasised the participatory relationship of people in nature, a theme that stood fast throughout his life and one that he often wrote about. (See, for instance, the last chapter in &quot;The Way of Zen&quot;.)

===Buddhism===

By his own assessment, Watts was imaginative, headstrong, and talkative. He was sent to boarding schools (which included both academic and religious training of the &quot;Muscular Christian&quot; sort) from early years. Of this religious training, he remarked &quot;Throughout my schooling, my religious indoctrination was grim and maudlin.&quot;

Watts spent several holidays in France in his teen years, accompanied by Francis Croshaw, a wealthy Epicurean with strong interests in both Buddhism and exotic, little-known aspects of European culture. Watts felt forced to decide between the Anglican Christianity he had been exposed to and the Buddhism he had read about in various libraries, including Croshaw&#x27;s. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the London Buddhist Lodge, which was then run by the barrister and QC Christmas Humphreys (who later became a judge at the Old Bailey). Watts became the organization&#x27;s secretary at 16 (1931). The young Watts explored several styles of meditation during these years.
===Education===
Watts won a scholarship to The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, the oldest boarding school in the country. Though he was frequently at the top of his classes scholastically and was given responsibilities at school, he botched an opportunity for a scholarship to Trinity College, Oxford by styling a crucial examination essay in a way that he said was read as &quot;presumptuous and capricious&quot;.

When he left King&#x27;s, Watts worked in a printing house and later a bank. He spent his spare time involved with the Buddhist Lodge and also under the tutelage of a &quot;rascal guru&quot;, Dimitrije Mitrinović, who was influenced by Peter Demianovich Ouspensky, G. I. Gurdjieff, and the psychoanalytical schools of Freud, Jung and Adler. Watts also read widely in philosophy, history, psychology, psychiatry, and Eastern wisdom.

By his own reckoning, and also by that of his biographer Monica Furlong, Watts was primarily an autodidact. His involvement with the Buddhist Lodge in London gave Watts opportunities for personal growth. Through Humphreys, he contacted spiritual authors, e.g. the artist, scholar, and mystic Nicholas Roerich, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and prominent theosophists like Alice Bailey.

In 1936, aged 21, he attended the World Congress of Faiths at the University of London, where he met the scholar of Zen Buddhism, D. T. Suzuki, who was presenting a paper. Beyond attending discussions, Watts studied the available scholarly literature, learning the fundamental concepts and terminology of Indian and East Asian philosophy.

===Influences and first publication===
Watts&#x27;s fascination with the Zen (Ch&#x27;an) tradition—beginning during the 1930s—developed because that tradition embodied the spiritual, interwoven with the practical, as exemplified in the subtitle of his &quot;Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work, and Art in the Far East&quot;. &quot;Work&quot;, &quot;life&quot;, and &quot;art&quot; were not demoted due to a spiritual focus. In his writing, he referred to it as &quot;the great Ch&#x27;an (emerging as Zen in Japan) synthesis of Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism after AD 700 in China.&quot; Watts published his first book, &quot;The Spirit of Zen,&quot; in 1936. Two decades later, in &quot;The Way of Zen&quot; he disparaged &quot;The Spirit of Zen&quot; as a &quot;popularisation of Suzuki&#x27;s earlier works, and besides being very unscholarly it is in many respects out of date and misleading.&quot;

Watts married Eleanor Everett, whose mother Ruth Fuller Everett was involved with a traditional Zen Buddhist circle in New York. Ruth Fuller later married the Zen master (or &quot;roshi&quot;), Sokei-an Sasaki, who served as a sort of model and mentor to Watts, though he chose not to enter into a formal Zen training relationship with Sasaki. During these years, according to his later writings, Watts had another mystical experience while on a walk with his wife. In 1938 they left England to live in the United States. Watts became a United States citizen in 1943.

===Christian priest and afterwards===
Watts left formal Zen training in New York because the method of the teacher did not suit him. He was not ordained as a Zen monk, but he felt a need to find a vocational outlet for his philosophical inclinations. He entered Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, an Episcopal (Anglican) school in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied Christian scriptures, theology, and church history. He attempted to work out a blend of contemporary Christian worship, mystical Christianity, and Asian philosophy. Watts was awarded a master&#x27;s degree in theology for his thesis, which he published as a popular edition under the title &quot;Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical Religion&quot;.

He later published &quot;Myth &amp; Ritual in Christianity&quot; (1953), an eisegesis of traditional Roman Catholic doctrine and ritual in Buddhist terms. Watts did not hide his dislike for religious outlooks that he decided were dour, guilt-ridden, or militantly proselytizing—no matter if they were found within Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, or Buddhism.

In early 1951, Watts moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco. Here he taught from 1951 to 1957 alongside Saburo Hasegawa (1906–1957), Frederic Spiegelberg, Haridas Chaudhuri, lama Tada Tōkan (1890–1967), and various visiting experts and professors. Hasegawa taught Watts about Japanese customs, arts, primitivism, and perceptions of nature. During this time he met the poet Jean Burden, with whom he had a four-year love affair.

Watts credited Burden as an &quot;important influence&quot; in his life and gave her a dedicatory cryptograph in his book &quot;Nature, Man and Woman&quot;, mentioned in his autobiography (p. 297). Besides teaching, Watts was for several years the academy&#x27;s administrator. One student of his was Eugene Rose, who later went on to become a noted Eastern Orthodox Christian hieromonk and controversial theologian within the Orthodox Church in America under the jurisdiction of ROCOR. Rose&#x27;s own disciple, a fellow monastic priest published under the name Hieromonk Damascene, produced a book entitled &quot;Christ the Eternal Tao&quot;, in which the author draws parallels between the concept of the Tao in Chinese religion and the concept of the &quot;Logos&quot; in classical Greek philosophy and Eastern Christian theology.

Watts also studied written Chinese and practised Chinese brush calligraphy with Hasegawa as well as with Hodo Tobase, who taught at the academy. Watts became proficient in Classical Chinese. While he was noted for an interest in Zen Buddhism, his reading and discussions delved into Vedanta, &quot;the new physics&quot;, cybernetics, semantics, process philosophy, natural history, and the anthropology of sexuality.

==Middle years==

Watts left the faculty in the mid-1950s. In 1953, he began what became a long-running weekly radio program at Pacifica Radio station KPFA in Berkeley. Like other volunteer programmers at the listener-sponsored station, Watts was not paid for his broadcasts. These weekly broadcasts continued until 1962, by which time he had attracted a &quot;legion of regular listeners&quot;.

Watts continued to give numerous talks and seminars, recordings of which were broadcast on KPFA and other radio stations during his life. These recordings are broadcast to this day. For example, in 1970, Watts&#x27; lectures were broadcast on Sunday mornings on San Francisco radio station KSAN; and even today a number of radio stations continue to have an Alan Watts program in their weekly program schedules. Original tapes of his broadcasts and talks are currently held by the Pacifica Radio Archives, based at KPFK in Los Angeles, and at the Electronic University archive founded by his son, Mark Watts.

In 1957 Watts, then 42, published one of his best-known books, &quot;The Way of Zen&quot;, which focused on philosophical explication and history. Besides drawing on the lifestyle and philosophical background of Zen in India and China and Japan, Watts introduced ideas drawn from general semantics (directly from the writings of Alfred Korzybski) and also from Norbert Wiener&#x27;s early work on cybernetics, which had recently been published. Watts offered analogies from cybernetic principles possibly applicable to the Zen life. The book sold well, eventually becoming a modern classic, and helped widen his lecture circuit.

In 1958, Watts toured parts of Europe with his father, meeting the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung and the German psychotherapist Karlfried Graf Dürckheim.

Upon returning to the United States, Watts recorded two seasons of a television series (1959–1960) for KQED public television in San Francisco, &quot;Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life&quot;.

In the 1960s, Watts became interested in how identifiable patterns in nature tend to repeat themselves from the smallest of scales to the most immense. This became one of his passions in his research and thought.

Though never affiliated for long with any one academic institution, he was Professor of Comparative Philosophy at the American Academy of Asian Studies, had a fellowship at Harvard University (1962–1964), and was a Scholar at San Jose State University (1968). He lectured college and university students as well as the general public. His lectures and books gave him influence on the American intelligentsia of the 1950s–1970s, but he was often seen as an outsider in academia. When questioned sharply by students during his talk at University of California, Santa Cruz, in 1970, Watts responded, as he had from the early sixties, that he was not an academic philosopher but rather &quot;a philosophical entertainer.&quot;

Some of Watts&#x27;s writings published in 1958 (e.g., his book &quot;Nature, Man and Woman&quot; and his essay &quot;The New Alchemy&quot;) mentioned some of his early views on the use of psychedelic drugs for mystical insight. Watts had begun to experiment with psychedelics, initially with mescaline given to him by Oscar Janiger. He tried LSD several times in 1958, with various research teams led by Keith S. Ditman, Sterling Bunnell Jr., and Michael Agron. He also tried marijuana and concluded that it was a useful and interesting psychoactive drug that gave the impression of time slowing down. Watts&#x27;s books of the &#x27;60s reveal the influence of these chemical adventures on his outlook.

He later said about psychedelic drug use, &quot;If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen.&quot;

===Applied Aesthetics===

Watts sometimes ate with his group of neighbours in Druid Heights (near Mill Valley, California), who had set up a community, living in what has been called &quot;shared bohemian poverty&quot;. Druid Heights was founded by the writer Elsa Gidlow, and Watts dedicated his book &quot;The Joyous Cosmology&quot; to the people of this neighbourhood. He later dedicated his autobiography to Elsa Gidlow.

Regarding his intention for living, Watts attempted to lessen the alienation that accompanies the experience of being human that he felt plagued the modern Westerner, and to lessen the ill will that was an unintentional by-product of alienation from the natural world. He felt such teaching could improve the world, at least to a degree. He also articulated the possibilities for greater incorporation of aesthetics (for example: better architecture, more art, more fine cuisine) in American life. In his autobiography he wrote, &quot;… cultural renewal comes about when highly differentiated cultures mix&quot;.

Watts discussed the theme of maithuna or spiritual-sexual union without emission by both partners in his book, &quot;Nature, Man and Woman&quot;, in which he discusses the possibility of the practice being known to early Christians and of it being kept secretly by the Church.

==Later years==
In his writings of the 1950s, he conveyed his admiration for the practicality in the historical achievements of Chan (Zen) in the Far East, for it had fostered farmers, architects, builders, folk physicians, artists, and administrators among the monks who had lived in the monasteries of its lineages. In his mature work, he presents himself as &quot;Zennist&quot; in spirit as he wrote in his last book, &quot;&quot;. Child rearing, the arts, cuisine, education, law and freedom, architecture, sexuality, and the uses and abuses of technology were all of great interest to him.

Though known for his discourses on Zen, he was also influenced by ancient Hindu scriptures, especially Vedanta and Yoga, aspects of which influenced Chan and Zen. He spoke extensively about the nature of the divine reality that Man misses: how the contradiction of opposites is the method of life and the means of cosmic and human evolution, how our fundamental ignorance is rooted in the exclusive nature - the instinctive grasping at identity, mind and ego, how to come in touch with the Field of Consciousness and Light, and other cosmic principles.

Watts sought to resolve his feelings of alienation from the institutions of marriage and the values of American society, as revealed in his comments on love relationships in &quot;Divine Madness&quot; and on perception of the organism-environment in &quot;The Philosophy of Nature&quot;. In looking at social issues he was concerned with the necessity for international peace, for tolerance, and understanding among disparate cultures.

Watts also came to feel acutely conscious of a growing ecological predicament. Writing, for example, in the early 1960s: &quot;Can any melting or burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising mountains of ruin—especially when the things we make and build are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they are thrown away?&quot; These concerns were later expressed in a television pilot, Conversation with Myself, made for NET (National Educational Television) filmed at Elsa Gidlow&#x27;s mountain retreat in 1971 in which he noted that the single track of conscious attention was wholly inadequate for interactions with a multi-tracked world.

==Death and legacy==

In October 1973, Watts returned from a European lecture tour to his cabin in Druid Heights, California. Friends of Watts had been concerned about him for some time over his alcoholism. On 16 November 1973, at age 58, he died in the Mandala House in Druid Heights. He was reported to have been under treatment for a heart condition. Before authorities could attend, his body was removed from his home and cremated on a wood pyre at a nearby beach by Buddhist monks. Mark Watts relates that Watts was cremated on Muir Beach at 8:30am after being discovered dead at 6:00am.

His ashes were split, with half buried near his library at Druid Heights and half at the Green Gulch Monastery.

His son, Mark Watts, investigated his death and found that his father had planned it meticulously: 
His wife, Mary Jane Watts, wrote later in a letter that Watts had said to her &quot;The secret of life is knowing when to stop&quot;.

A personal account of Watts&#x27;s last years and approach to death is given by Al Chung-liang Huang in &quot;&quot;.

==Views==

===On spiritual and social identity===

Regarding his ethical outlook, Watts felt that absolute morality had nothing to do with the fundamental realization of one&#x27;s deep spiritual identity. He advocated social rather than personal ethics. In his writings, Watts was increasingly concerned with ethics applied to relations between humanity and the natural environment and between governments and citizens. He wrote out of an appreciation of a racially and culturally diverse social landscape.

He often said that he wished to act as a bridge between the ancient and the modern, between East and West, and between culture and nature.

===Worldview===

In several of his later publications, especially &quot;Beyond Theology&quot; and &quot;The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are&quot;, Watts put forward a worldview, drawing on Hinduism, Chinese philosophy, pantheism or panentheism, and modern science, in which he maintains that the whole universe consists of a cosmic Self-playing hide-and-seek (Lila); hiding from itself (Maya) by becoming all the living and non-living things in the universe and forgetting what it really is – the upshot being that we are all IT in disguise (Tat Tvam Asi). In this worldview, Watts asserts that our conception of ourselves as an &quot;ego in a bag of skin&quot;, or &quot;skin-encapsulated ego&quot; is a myth; the entities we call the separate &quot;things&quot; are merely aspects or features of the whole.

Watts&#x27;s books frequently include discussions reflecting his keen interest in patterns that occur in nature and that are repeated in various ways and at a wide range of scales – including the patterns to be discerned in the history of civilizations.

===Supporters and critics===

Watts&#x27; explorations and teaching brought him into contact with many noted intellectuals, artists, and American teachers in the human potential movement. His friendship with poet Gary Snyder nurtured his sympathies with the budding environmental movement, to which Watts gave philosophical support. He also encountered Robert Anton Wilson, who credited Watts with being one of his &quot;Light[s] along the Way&quot; in the opening appreciation of his 1977 book &quot;Cosmic Trigger: The Final Secret of the Illuminati&quot;. Werner Erhard attended workshops given by Alan Watts and said of him, &quot;He pointed me toward what I now call the distinction between Self and Mind. After my encounter with Alan, the context in which I was working shifted.&quot;

Watts has been criticized by Buddhists such as Philip Kapleau and D. T. Suzuki for allegedly misinterpreting several key Zen Buddhist concepts. In particular, he drew criticism from Zen masters who maintain that zazen must entail a strict and specific means of sitting, as opposed to being a cultivated state of mind that is available at any moment in any situation (which traditionally might be possible by a very few after intense and dedicated effort in a formal sitting practice). Typical of these is Roshi Kapleau&#x27;s claim that Watts dismissed zazen on the basis of only half a koan.

In regard to the half-koan, Robert Baker Aitken reports that Suzuki told him, &quot;I regret to say that Mr. Watts did not understand that story.&quot; In his talks, Watts defined zazen practice by saying, &quot;A cat sits until it is tired of sitting, then gets up, stretches, and walks away&quot;, and referred out of context to Zen master Bankei who said: &quot;Even when you&#x27;re sitting in meditation, if there&#x27;s something you&#x27;ve got to do, it&#x27;s quite all right to get up and leave&quot;.

However, Watts did have his supporters in the Zen community, including Shunryu Suzuki, the founder of the San Francisco Zen Center. As David Chadwick recounted in his biography of Suzuki, &quot;Crooked Cucumber: the Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki&quot;, when a student of Suzuki&#x27;s disparaged Watts by saying &quot;we used to think he was profound until we found the real thing&quot;, Suzuki fumed with a sudden intensity, saying, &quot;You completely miss the point about Alan Watts! You should notice what he has done. He is a great bodhisattva.&quot;

Watts&#x27;s biographers saw him—after his stint as an Anglican priest—as representative of not so much a religion but as a lone-wolf thinker and social rascal. In David Stuart&#x27;s biography, Watts is seen as an unusually gifted speaker and writer driven by his own interests, enthusiasms, and demons. Elsa Gidlow, whom Watts called &quot;sister&quot;, refused to be interviewed for the biography, but later painted a kinder picture of Watts&#x27;s life in her own autobiography, &quot;Elsa, I Come with My Songs&quot;. According to critic Erik Davis, his &quot;writings and recorded talks still shimmer with a profound and galvanizing lucidity.&quot;

Unabashed, Watts was not averse to acknowledging his rascal nature, referring to himself in his autobiography &quot;In My Own Way&quot; as &quot;a sedentary and contemplative character, an intellectual, a Brahmin, a mystic and also somewhat of a disreputable epicurean who has three wives, seven children and five grandchildren&quot;.

==Personal life==

Watts married three times and had seven children (five daughters and two sons). He met Eleanor Everett in 1936, when her mother, Ruth Fuller Everett, brought her to London to study piano. They met at the Buddhist Lodge, were engaged the following year and married in April 1938. A daughter was born in 1938 and another in 1942. Their marriage ended in 1949, but Watts continued to correspond with his former mother-in-law.

In 1950, Watts married Dorothy DeWitt. He moved to San Francisco in early 1951 to teach. They had five children. The couple separated in the early 1960s after Watts met Mary Jane Yates King (called &quot;Jano&quot; in his circle) while lecturing in New York.

After a divorce, he married King in 1964. The couple divided their time between Sausalito, California, where they lived on a houseboat called the &quot;Vallejo&quot;, and a secluded cabin in Druid Heights, on the southwest flank of Mount Tamalpais north of San Francisco. King died in 2015.

He also maintained relations with Jean Burden, his lover and the inspiration/editor of &quot;Nature, Man and Woman.&quot;

Watts was a heavy smoker throughout his life and in his later years drank heavily.

<text>The hippie trail (also the overland) was an overland journey taken by members of the hippie subculture and others from the mid-1950s to the late 1970s travelling from Europe and West Asia through South Asia via countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh to Thailand. The hippie trail was a form of alternative tourism, and one of the key elements was travelling as cheaply as possible, mainly to extend the length of time away from home. The term &quot;hippie&quot; became current in the mid-to-late 1960s; &quot;beatnik&quot; was the previous term from the later 1950s.

In every major stop of the hippie trail, there were hotels, restaurants and cafés for Westerners, who networked with each other as they travelled east and west. The hippies tended to interact more with the local population than traditional sightseers did.

The hippie trail largely ended in the late 1970s primarily due to both the Iranian Revolution resulting in an anti-Western government, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, closing the route to Western travelers.

Nowadays, a handful of overlanders, vandwellers and adventurers roughly follow the route of the old hippie trail.

==Routes==
Journeys would typically start from cities in western Europe, often London, Copenhagen, West Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, or Milan. Many from the United States took Icelandic Airlines to Luxembourg. Most journeys passed through Istanbul, where routes divided. The usual northern route passed through Tehran, Herat, Kandahar, Kabul, Peshawar and Lahore on to India, Nepal and Southeast Asia. An alternative route was from Turkey via Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq to Iran and Pakistan. All travellers had to cross through Afghanistan and the Khyber Pass, traversing Peshawar and Lahore in Pakistan and over the Pakistan-India border at Ganda Singh Wala (or later at Wagah).

Common destinations in the east included Delhi, Varanasi (then known as &quot;Benares&quot;), Goa, Bombay, Madras, Kathmandu and Bangkok. Kathmandu still has a road, &quot;Jhochhen Tole&quot;, nicknamed Freak Street in commemoration of the many thousands of hippies who passed through. Further travel to southern India, Kovalam beach in Trivandrum (Kerala) and Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) was sometimes also undertaken.

Kathmandu was usually the terminus of the hippie trail, since Tibet was off-limits and overland journey through Burma was not possible, as India was severely restricting travel to Burma due to clashes between insurgents and Indian armed forces, and the Ledo Road crossing to Burma had fallen into disrepair and largely been reclaimed by the jungle. However, one could fly from Kathmandu to Bangkok to continue the journey in Southeast Asia to Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia (where Bali was a popular destination for hippies). From Indonesia, there was also the option of crossing to Australia by plane or ship. That led to the trail from Timor to Thailand being classified as Hippie Trail South East Asia Extension, which mainly attracted Australians and New Zealanders traveling the opposite way overland to London. Tony Wheeler&#x27;s travel guide is written from a POV of reverse hippie trail, traveling from Australia to Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, flying from Bangkok to Kathmandu (or Calcutta) and then continuing on to India and eventually to Europe.
Beyond the major route, Jimi Hendrix also popularized Essaouira as a hippie destination in Morocco.

==Methods of travel==
To keep costs low, journeys were carried out by hitchhiking, or cheap, private buses that travelled the route. There were also trains that travelled part of the way, particularly across Eastern Europe through Turkey (with a ferry connection across Lake Van) and to Tehran or east to Mashhad, Iran. From these cities, public or private transportation could then be obtained for the remainder of the trip. The bulk of travellers were Western Europeans, North Americans, Australians, and Japanese. Ideas and experiences were exchanged in well-known hostels, hotels, and other gathering spots along the way, such as Yener&#x27;s Café and The Pudding Shop in Istanbul, Sigi&#x27;s on Chicken Street in Kabul or the Amir Kabir in Tehran. Many used backpacks and, while the majority were young, older people and families occasionally travelled the route. A number drove the entire distance.

==Decline of the trail==
The hippie trail came to an end in the late 1970s with political changes in previously hospitable countries. In 1979, both the Iranian Revolution and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan closed the overland route to South Asia for Western travellers, and Chitral and Kashmir became less inviting due to tensions and territorial conflicts in the area. Meagan Day summarized that &quot;radio stations in Iran swapped Blue Öyster Cult for speeches by Ayatollah Khomeini.&quot; Other factors that led to difficult conditions for travellers were the Saur Revolution (1978), and the advent of a military dictatorship in Pakistan (1977) that banned many hippie attractions.

In the Middle Eastern route, the Yom Kippur War in 1973 also put in place strict visa restrictions for Western citizens in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. The Lebanese Civil War had already broken out in 1975. Richard Nixon started a drug war which also included cannabis. Due to the constant pressure from USA, in 1976 Nepal enacted Narcotic Drugs (Control) Act prohibiting the trade, farming or any kind of cannabis activities in the country.

Locals also became increasingly wary of Western travellers – notably in the region between Kabul and Peshawar, where residents became increasingly frightened and repulsed by unkempt hippies who were drawn to the region for its famed opium and wild cannabis.

Travel organizers Sundowners and Topdeck pioneered a route through Balochistan. Topdeck continued its trips throughout the Iran–Iraq War and later conflicts, but took its last trip in 1998.

From the mid 2000s, the route has again become somewhat feasible, but continuing conflict and tensions in Iraq and Afghanistan mean the route is much more difficult and risky to negotiate than in its heyday. In September 2007, Ozbus embarked upon a short-lived service between London and Sydney over the route of the hippie trail, and commercial trips were offered in 2010 between Europe and Asia, bypassing Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, by going through Nepal and China to the old Silk Road.

== Guides and travelogues ==
The BIT Guide, recounting collective experiences and reproduced at a fairly low cost, produced the early duplicated stapled-together &quot;foolscap bundle&quot; with a pink cover providing information for travellers and updated by those on the road, warning of pitfalls and places to see and stay. BIT, under Geoff Crowther (who later joined Lonely Planet), lasted from 1972 until the last edition in 1980. The 1971 edition of &quot;The Whole Earth Catalog&quot; devoted a page to the &quot;Overland Guide to Nepal.&quot; In 1973, Tony Wheeler and his wife Maureen Wheeler, the creators of the Lonely Planet guidebooks, produced a publication about the hippie trail called &quot;Across Asia On The Cheap&quot;. They wrote this 94-page pamphlet based upon travel experiences gained by crossing Western Europe, the Balkans, Turkey and Iran from London in a minivan. After having travelled through these regions, they sold the van in Afghanistan and continued on a succession of chicken buses, third-class trains and long-distance trucks. They crossed Pakistan, India, Nepal, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia and arrived nine months later in Sydney with a combined 27 cents in their pockets.

Paul Theroux wrote an account of the route in &quot;The Great Railway Bazaar&quot; (1975). Two later travel books — &quot;The Wrong Way Home&quot; (1999) by Peter Moore and &quot;Magic Bus&quot; (2008) by Rory Maclean — also retrace the original hippie trail.

<doc id="202481" wikidata="Q203942" url="?curid=202481" title="Galdhøpiggen">
<text>Galdhøpiggen () is the highest mountain in Norway, Scandinavia, and Northern Europe. The mountain is located in Lom Municipality in Innlandet county, Norway. It is in the Jotunheimen mountains within Jotunheimen National Park. The mountain sits about southwest of the village of Fossbergom and about northeast of the village of Øvre Årdal. The mountain is surrounded by several other notable mountains including Keilhaus topp to the east; Store Styggehøe to the southeast; Svellnosbreahesten, Midtre Tverråtinden, and Store Tverråtinden to the south; Storjuvtinden and Skardstinden to the west; Veslpiggen, Storgrovtinden, and Storgrovhøe to the northwest; and Galdhøi and Juvvasshøi to the northeast.

==Etymology==

&quot;Galdhøpiggen&quot; means &quot;the peak/spike (&quot;&quot;) of the mountain Galdhø.&quot; The first element in the name of the mountain is &quot;&quot; (m.) which means &quot;steep mountain road&quot;. The part of the valley Bøverdalen closest to the mountain is called Galde. The last element is &quot;&quot; (f.) which means &quot;(big and) rounded mountain.&quot; An old road between Gudbrandsdalen and Sogn passes beneath the mountain.

== History ==

Geologically, Galdhøpiggen belongs to the Caledonian folding, like most of South Norway&#x27;s mountain ranges. The peak is made of gabbro, a hard but rather coarse-grained rock which is found in most of the Jotunheimen range. During the ice ages it was heavily glaciated and got its present form. The theory that the highest summits in Norway stayed above the ice as nunataks has been abandoned by most geologists. It fits well with the present flora in the area, but it does not fit well with the present knowledge of ice thickness and the results of glaciation.

For many years, geologists did not know that Galdhøpiggen was in fact the highest summit in Norway. That distinction was instead granted to Snøhetta in the Dovrefjell range, visible on the Oslo-Trondheim land route. Hence no attempts were made to climb the peak, while Snøhetta was visited for the first time in 1798 as part of a scientific trip to the area. In 1844 the geologist and mountaineer, Baltazar Mathias Keilhau, made two unsuccessful attempts to reach the summit. On one of these he reached a summit, which was later named Keilhaus topp (at 2,355 m above sea level very close to Galdhøpiggen), but the terrible weather forced him to return.

In 1850 three men from Lom reached the summit; the guide Steinar Sulheim, the local teacher Lars Arnesen and the church warden Ingebrigt Flotten.

== Access and modern tourism ==
There are two possible routes to reach the summit. One starts at Juvasshytta and the other at Spiterstulen.
There are three summits on the route from Spiterstulen: Svellnose, Keilhaus topp and the summit itself. During the main season guided trips take one to the summit from Spiterstulen via the well known blue ice fall on Svellnosbreen.

The main season for hiking to Galdhøpiggen is between June and August. The season is determined by the melting and first appearance of snow, so it does not follow a set date. The peak is a common destination for backcountry skiers in the months of April and May.

At Juvasshytta there is an alpine ski resort with lift on a glacier, reaching an elevation of above sea level, the highest in Scandinavia. It is called Galdhøpiggen Summer Ski Centre and is open from June and all the summer when the road is open.

== Summit ==
Galdhøpiggen had earlier been challenged for the title as the highest mountain in Norway by Glittertind, as some measurements showed Glittertind was slightly higher including the glacier at its peak.

This glacier has, however, shrunk in recent years, and Glittertind is now only even including the glacier. Hence, the dispute has been settled in Galdhøpiggen&#x27;s favour.

At the summit a small cabin has been built. In the summer soft drinks, chocolate bars, postcards and other items are sold here. Earlier the Norwegian Postal Authority had a small post office here—being the highest in Northern Europe. Galdhøpiggen is not only the highest summit in Northern Europe, it also contains two probably unbreakable horticultural records in Northern Europe, being the upper limit for &quot;Ranunculus glacialis&quot; (2370 m) and &quot;Saxifraga oppositifolia&quot; (2350 m). Since the summer might not occur at all, some years, it tells something about these flowers&#x27; adaptation to the extremely harsh climate.

On sunny days in the later part of July and August, the summit is visited by hundreds of people.

<text>The foot (standard symbol: ft) is a unit of length in the British imperial and United States customary systems of measurement. The prime symbol, , is commonly used to represent the foot. In both customary and imperial units, one foot comprises 12 inches, and one yard comprises three feet. Since an international agreement in 1959, the foot is defined as equal to exactly 0.3048 meters. 

Historically, the &quot;foot&quot; was a part of many local systems of units, including the Greek, Roman, Chinese, French, and English systems. It varied in length from country to country, from city to city, and sometimes from trade to trade. Its length was usually between 250 mm and 335 mm and was generally, but not always, subdivided into 12 inches or 16 digits.

The United States is the only industrialized country that uses the (international) foot in preference to the meter in its commercial, engineering, and standards activities. The foot is legally recognized in the United Kingdom; road distance signs &quot;must&quot; use imperial units (however, distances on road signs are always marked in miles or yards, not feet; bridge clearances are given in meters as well as feet and inches), while its usage is widespread among the British public as a measurement of height. The foot is recognized as an alternative expression of length in Canada. Both the UK and Canada have partially metricated their units of measurement. The measurement of altitude in international aviation (the flight level unit) is one of the few areas where the foot is used outside the English-speaking world.

The most common plural of foot is feet. However, the singular form may be used like a plural when it is preceded by a number, as in &quot;he is six foot tall.&quot;

==Historical origin==
Historically, the human body has been used to provide the basis for units of length. The foot of an adult European-American male is typically about 15.3% of his height, giving a person of a foot-length of about , on average.

Archaeologists believe that, in the past, the people of Egypt, India, and Mesopotamia preferred the cubit, while the people of Rome, Greece, and China preferred the foot. Under the Harappan linear measures, Indus cities during the Bronze Age used a foot of and a cubit of . The Egyptian equivalent of the foot—a measure of four palms or 16 digits—was known as the and has been reconstructed as about .

The Greek foot (, ) had a length of of a stadion, one stadion being about ; therefore a foot was, at the time, about . Its exact size varied from city to city and could range between and , but lengths used for temple construction appear to have been about to ; the former was close to the size of the Roman foot.

The standard Roman foot () was normally about (97% of today&#x27;s measurement), but in some provinces, particularly Germania Inferior, the so-called (foot of Nero Claudius Drusus) was sometimes used, with a length of about . (In reality, this foot predated Drusus.)

Originally both the Greeks and the Romans subdivided the foot into 16 digits, but in later years, the Romans also subdivided the foot into 12 (from which both the English words &quot;inch&quot; and &quot;ounce&quot; are derived).

After the fall of the Roman Empire, some Roman traditions were continued but others fell into disuse. In AD 790 Charlemagne attempted to reform the units of measure in his domains. His units of length were based on the and in particular the , the distance between the fingertips of the outstretched arms of a man. The has 6 (feet) each of .

He was unsuccessful in introducing a standard unit of length throughout his realm: an analysis of the measurements of Charlieu Abbey shows that during the 9th century the Roman foot of was used; when it was rebuilt in the 10th century, a foot of about was used. At the same time, monastic buildings used the Carolingian foot of .

The procedure for verification of the foot as described in the 16th century posthumously published work by Jacob Köbel in his book is:
===England===

The Neolithic long foot, first proposed by archeologists Mike Parker Pearson and Andrew Chamberlain, is based upon calculations from surveys of Phase 1 elements at Stonehenge. They found that the underlying diameters of the stone circles had been consistently laid out using multiples of a base unit amounting to 30 long feet, which they calculated to be 1.056 of a modern international foot (thus 12.672 inches or 0.3219 m). Furthermore, this unit is identifiable in the dimensions of some stone lintels at the site and in the diameter of the &quot;southern circle&quot; at nearby Durrington Walls. Evidence that this unit was in widespread use across southern Britain is available from the Folkton Drums from Yorkshire (neolithic artifacts, made from chalk, with circumferences that exactly divide as integers into ten long feet) and a similar object, the Lavant drum, excavated at Lavant, Sussex, again with a circumference divisible as a whole number into ten long feet.

The measures of Iron Age Britain are uncertain and proposed reconstructions such as the Megalithic Yard are controversial. Later Welsh legend credited Dyfnwal Moelmud with the establishment of their units, including a foot of 9 inches. The Belgic or North German foot of was introduced to England either by the Belgic Celts during their invasions prior to the Romans or by the Anglo-Saxons in the 5th and 6th century.

Roman units were introduced following their invasion in AD 43. Following the Roman withdrawal and Saxon invasions, the Roman foot continued to be used in the construction crafts while the Belgic foot was used for land measurement. Both the Welsh and Belgic feet seem to have been based on multiples of the barleycorn, but by as early as 950 the English kings seem to have (ineffectually) ordered measures to be based upon an iron yardstick at Winchester and then London. Henry I was said to have ordered a new standard to be based upon the length of his own arm and, by the Act concerning the Composition of Yards and Perches traditionally credited to Edward I or II, the statute foot was a different measure, exactly of the old (Belgic) foot. The barleycorn, inch, ell, and yard were likewise shrunk, while rods and furlongs remained the same. The ambiguity over the state of the mile was resolved by the 1593 Act against Converting of Great Houses into Several Tenements and for Restraint of Inmates and Inclosures in and near about the City of London and Westminster, which codified the statute mile as comprising 5,280 feet. The differences among the various physical standard yards around the world, revealed by increasingly powerful microscopes, eventually led to the 1959 adoption of the international foot defined in terms of the meter.

==Definition==

===International foot===
The international yard and pound agreement of July 1959 defined the length of the international yard in the United States and countries of the Commonwealth of Nations as exactly 0.9144 meters. Consequently, since a foot is one third of a yard, the international foot is defined to be equal to exactly 0.3048 meters. This was 2 ppm shorter than the previous US definition and 1.7 ppm longer than the previous British definition.

The 1959 agreement concluded a series of step-by-step events, set off in particular by the British Standards Institution&#x27;s adoption of a scientific standard inch of 25.4 millimeters in 1930.

====Symbol====
The IEEE standard symbol for a foot is &quot;ft&quot;. In some cases, the foot is denoted by a prime, often approximated by an apostrophe, and the inch by a double prime; for example, 2feet 4 inches is sometimes denoted 2′4″.

=== Imperial units ===
In Imperial units, the foot was defined as  yard, with the yard being realized as a physical standard (separate from the standard meter). The yard standards of the different Commonwealth countries were periodically compared with one another. The value of the United Kingdom primary standard of the yard was determined in terms of the meter by the National Physical Laboratory in 1964 to be , implying a pre-1959 UK foot of .

The UK adopted the international yard for all purposes through the Weights and Measures Act 1963, effective January 1, 1964.

===Survey foot===
When the international foot was defined in 1959, a great deal of survey data was already available based on the former definitions, especially in the United States and in India. The small difference between the survey foot and the international foot would not be detectable on a survey of a small parcel, but becomes significant for mapping, or when the state plane coordinate system (SPCS) is used in the US, because the origin of the system may be hundreds of thousands of feet (hundreds of miles) from the point of interest. Hence the previous definitions continued to be used for surveying in the United States and India for many years, and are denoted survey feet to distinguish them from the international foot. The United Kingdom was unaffected by this problem, as the retriangulation of Great Britain (1936–62) had been done in meters.

====US survey foot====
In the United States, the foot was defined as 12 inches, with the inch being defined by the Mendenhall Order of 1893 via 39.37 inches = 1 m (making a US foot exactly meters, approximately ).

On December 31, 2022, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Geodetic Survey, and the United States Department of Commerce deprecated use of the US survey foot and recommended conversion to either the meter or the international foot (0.3048 m). However, the historic relevance of the US survey foot persists, as the &quot;Federal Register&quot; notes:

State legislation is also important for determining the conversion factor to be used for everyday land surveying and real estate transactions, although the difference (two parts per million) is of no practical significance given the precision of normal surveying measurements over short distances (usually much less than a mile). Out of 50 states and six other jurisdictions, 40 have legislated that surveying measures should be based on the US survey foot, six have legislated that they be made on the basis of the international foot, and ten have not specified.

====Indian survey foot====
The Indian survey foot is defined as exactly , presumably derived from a measurement of the previous Indian standard of the yard. The current National Topographic Database of the Survey of India is based on the metric WGS-84 datum, which is also used by the Global Positioning System.

==Historical use==
===Metric foot===

An ISO 2848 measure of 3 basic modules (30 cm) is called a &quot;metric foot&quot;, but there were earlier distinct definitions of a metric foot during metrication in France and Germany.

====France====

In 1799 the meter became the official unit of length in France. This was not fully enforced, and in 1812 Napoleon introduced the system of &quot;mesures usuelles&quot; which restored the traditional French measurements in the retail trade, but redefined them in terms of metric units. The foot, or &quot;pied métrique&quot;, was defined as one third of a meter. This unit continued in use until 1837.

====Germany====

In southwestern Germany in 1806, the Confederation of the Rhine was founded and three different &quot;reformed feet&quot; were defined, all of which were based on the metric system:
*In Hesse, the &quot;Fuß&quot; (foot) was redefined as 25 cm.
*In Baden, the &quot;Fuß&quot; was redefined as 30 cm.
*In the Palatinate, the &quot;Fuß&quot; was redefined as being  cm (as in France).

===Other obsolete feet===
Prior to the introduction of the metric system, many European cities and countries used the foot, but it varied considerably in length: the in Ypres, Belgium, was 273.8 millimeters (10.78in) while the in Venice was 347.73 millimeters (13.690in). Lists of conversion factors between the various units of measure were given in many European reference works including:
*Traité, Paris – 1769
*Palaiseau – Bordeaux: 1816 
*de Gelder, Amsterdam and The Hague – 1824
*Horace, Brussels – 1840
*Noback &amp; Noback (2 volumes), Leipzig – 1851
*Bruhns, Leipzig – 1881

Many of these standards were peculiar to a particular city, especially in Germany (which, before German unification in 1871, consisted of many kingdoms, principalities, free cities and so on). In many cases the length of the unit was not uniquely fixed: for example, the English foot was stated as 11 &quot;pouces&quot; 2.6 &quot;lignes&quot; (French inches and lines) by Picard, 11 &quot;pouces&quot; 3.11 &quot;lignes&quot; by Maskelyne, and 11 &quot;pouces&quot; 3 &quot;lignes&quot; by D&#x27;Alembert.

Most of the various feet in this list ceased to be used when the countries adopted the metric system. The Netherlands and modern Belgium adopted the metric system in 1817, having used the under Napoleon and the newly formed German Empire adopted the metric system in 1871.

The palm (typically 200–280 mm, ie. 7 to 11 inches) was used in many Mediterranean cities instead of the foot. Horace Doursther, whose reference was published in Belgium which had the smallest foot measurements, grouped both units together, while J. F. G. Palaiseau devoted three chapters to units of length: one for linear measures (palms and feet); one for cloth measures (ells); and one for distances traveled (miles and leagues).

====Obsolete feet details====


In Belgium, the words (French) and (Dutch) would have been used interchangeably.

====Notes====
==Present day uses==

===International ISO-standard and other intermodal shipping containers ===
International Standards Organisation (ISO)-defined intermodal containers for efficient global freight/cargo shipping, were defined using feet rather than meters for their leading outside (corner) dimensions. All ISO-standard containers to this day are eight feet wide, and their outer heights and lengths are also primarily defined in, or derived from feet. &lt;br&gt;
Quantities of global shipping containers are still primarily counted in Twenty-foot Equivalent Units, or TEUs.

===Aviation===
Everyday global (civilian) air traffic / aviation continues to be controlled in flight levels (flying altitudes) separated by thousands of feet (although typically read out in hundreds – e.g. flight level 330 actually means 33,000 feet, or about 10 kilometres in altitude).

===Relation to shoe size===
The length of the (international) foot corresponds to a human foot with shoe size of 13 (UK), 14 (US male), 15.5 (US female) or 48 (EU sizing).

==Dimension==
In measurement, the term &quot;linear foot&quot; (sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;lineal foot&quot;) refers to the number of feet in a length of material (such as lumber or fabric) without regard to the width; it is used to distinguish from surface area in &quot;square foot&quot;.

<text>In military terminology, friendly fire or fratricide is an attack by belligerent or neutral forces on friendly troops while attempting to attack enemy or hostile targets. Examples include misidentifying the target as hostile, cross-fire while engaging an enemy, long range ranging errors or inaccuracy. Accidental fire not intended to attack enemy or hostile targets, and deliberate firing on one&#x27;s own troops for disciplinary reasons is not called friendly fire, and neither is unintentional harm to civilian or neutral targets, which is sometimes referred to as collateral damage. Training accidents and bloodless incidents also do not qualify as friendly fire in terms of casualty reporting.

Use of the term &quot;friendly&quot; in a military context for allied personnel started during the First World War, often when shells fell short of the targeted enemy. The term &quot;friendly fire&quot; was originally adopted by the United States military; S.L.A. Marshall used the term in &quot;Men Against Fire&quot; in 1947. Many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) militaries refer to these incidents as &quot;blue on blue&quot;, which derives from military exercises where NATO forces were identified by blue pennants and units representing Warsaw Pact forces by red pennants. In classical forms of warfare where hand-to-hand combat dominated, death from a &quot;friendly&quot; was rare, but in industrialized warfare, deaths from friendly fire are more common.

Friendly fire should not be confused with fragging, which is the uncondoned &quot;intentional&quot; (or attempted) killing of servicemen by fellow personnel serving on the same side.

==History==
Paul R. Syms argues that friendly fire is an ancient phenomenon. He notes recorded events in Ancient Greece and other early accounts of battles. He and other historians also note that weapons such as guns, artillery, and aircraft dramatically increased friendly-fire casualties.

By the 20th and 21st centuries, friendly-fire casualties have likely become a significant percentage of combat injuries and fatalities. Jon Krakauer provides an overview of American casualties during and since the Second World War:
==Under-reporting==
In the annals of warfare, deaths at the hand of the enemy are often valorized, while those at the hand of friendly forces may be cast in shame. Moreover, because public relations and morale are important, especially in modern warfare, the military may be inclined to under-report incidents of friendly-fire, especially when in charge of both investigations and press releases:

Although there may well be a longstanding history of such bias, Krakauer claims &quot;the scale and sophistication of these recent propaganda efforts, and the unabashedness of their executors&quot; in Iraq and Afghanistan is new.

==Causes==
===Fog of war===
Friendly fire can arise from the &quot;fog of war&quot; – the confusion inherent in warfare. Friendly fire that is the result of apparent recklessness or incompetence may be improperly lumped into this category. The concept of a fog of war has come under considerable criticism, as it can be used as an excuse for poor planning, weak or compromised intelligence and incompetent command.

===Errors of position===
Errors of position occur when fire aimed at enemy forces may accidentally end up hitting one&#x27;s own. Such incidents are exacerbated by close proximity of combatants and were relatively common during the First and Second World Wars, where troops fought in close combat and targeting was relatively inaccurate. As the accuracy of weapons improved, this class of incident has become less common but still occurs.

===Errors of identification===
Errors of identification happen when friendly troops are mistakenly attacked in the belief that they are the enemy. Highly mobile battles, and battles involving troops from many nations are more likely to cause this kind of incident as evidenced by incidents in the 1991 Gulf War, or the shooting down of a British aircraft by a U.S. Patriot battery during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In the Tarnak Farm incident, four Canadian soldiers were killed and eight others injured when a U.S. Air National Guard major dropped a 500 lb (230 kg) bomb from his F-16 onto the Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry regiment which was conducting a night firing exercise near Kandahar. Another case of such an accident was the death of Pat Tillman in Afghanistan, although the exact circumstances of that incident are yet to be definitively determined.

During World War II, &quot;invasion stripes&quot; were painted on Allied aircraft to assist identification in preparation for the invasion of Normandy. Similar markings had been used when the Hawker Typhoon was first introduced into use as it was otherwise very similar in profile to a German aircraft. Late in the war the &quot;protection squadron&quot; that covered the elite German jet fighter squadron as it landed or took off were brightly painted to distinguish them from raiding Allied fighters.

===Errors of response inhibition===
Errors of response inhibition have recently been proposed as another potential cause of some friendly fire accidents. These types of errors are different from visual misidentification, and instead appear to be caused by a failure to inhibit a shooting response.

A number of situations can lead to or exacerbate the risk of friendly fire. Difficult terrain and visibility are major factors. Soldiers fighting on unfamiliar ground can become disoriented more easily than on familiar terrain. The direction from which enemy fire comes may not be easy to identify, and poor weather conditions and combat stress may add to the confusion, especially if fire is exchanged. Accurate navigation and fire discipline are vital. In high-risk situations, leaders need to ensure units are properly informed of the location of friendly units and must issue clear, unambiguous orders, but they must also react correctly to responses from soldiers who are capable of using their own judgement. Miscommunication can be deadly. Radios, field telephones, and signalling systems can be used to address the problem, but when these systems are used to co-ordinate multiple forces such as ground troops and aircraft, their breakdown can dramatically increase the risk of friendly fire. When allied troops are operating, the situation is even more complex, especially with language barriers to overcome.

==Impact reduction==

Some analyses dismiss the material impact of friendly fire, by concluding friendly-fire casualties are usually too few to affect the outcome of a battle. The effects of friendly fire, however, are not just material. Troops expect to be targeted by the enemy, but being hit by their own forces has a huge negative impact on morale. Forces doubt the competence of their command, and its prevalence makes commanders more cautious in the field.

Attempts to reduce this effect by military leaders involve identifying the causes of friendly fire and overcoming repetition of the incident through training, tactics and technology.

===Training===

Most militaries use extensive training to ensure troop safety as part of normal coordination and planning, but are not always exposed to possible friendly-fire situations to ensure they are aware of situations where the risk is high. Difficult terrain and bad weather cannot be controlled, but soldiers must be trained to operate effectively in these conditions, as well as being trained to fight at night. Such simulated training is now commonplace for soldiers worldwide. Avoiding friendly fire can be as straightforward as ensuring fire discipline is instilled in troops, so that they fire and cease firing when they are told to. Firing ranges now also include &quot;don&#x27;t fire&quot; targets.

The increasing sophistication of weaponry, and the tactics employed against American forces to deliberately confuse them has meant that while overall casualties have fallen for American soldiers in the late 20th and 21st centuries, the overall percentage of deaths due to friendly fire in American actions has risen dramatically. In the 1991 Gulf War, most of the Americans killed by their own forces were crew members of armored vehicles hit by anti-tank rounds. The response in training includes recognition training for Apache helicopter crews to help them distinguish American tanks and armored vehicles at night and in bad weather from those of the enemy. In addition, tank gunners must watch for &quot;friendly&quot; robotic tanks that pop out on training courses in California&#x27;s Mojave Desert. They also study video footage to help them recognize American forces in battle more quickly.

===Technological fixes===

Improved technology to assist in identifying friendly forces is also an ongoing response to friendly fire problems.
From the earliest days of warfare, identification systems were visual and developed into extremely elaborate suits of armour with distinctive heraldic patterns. During the Napoleonic Wars, Admiral Nelson ordered that ships under his command adopt a common paint scheme to reduce friendly fire incidents; this pattern became known as the Nelson Chequer. Invasion stripes served a similar function during the Allied invasion of Normandy in World War II. When radar was developed during World War II, IFF (&quot;Identification friend or foe&quot;) systems to identify aircraft developed into a multitude of radio beacons.

Correct navigation is vital to ensuring units know where they are in relation to their own force and the enemy. Efforts to provide accurate compasses inside metal boxes in tanks and trucks has proven difficult, with GPS a major breakthrough.

Other technological changes include hand-held navigational devices that use satellite signals, giving ground forces the exact location of enemy forces as well as their own. The use of infrared lights and thermal tape that are invisible to observers without night-goggles, or fibres and dyes that reflect only specific wavelengths are developing into key identifiers for friendly infantry units at night.

There is also some development of remote sensors to detect enemy vehicles – the Remotely Monitored Battlefield Sensor System (REMBASS) uses a combination of acoustic, seismic vibration, and infrared to not just detect, but identify vehicles.

===Tactics===

Some tactics make friendly fire virtually inevitable, such as the practice of dropping barrages of mortars on enemy machine gun posts in the final moments before capture. This practice continued throughout the 20th century since machine guns were first used in World War I. The high friendly fire risk has generally been accepted by troops since machine gun emplacements are tactically so valuable, and at the same time so dangerous that the attackers wanted them to be shelled, considering the shells far less deadly than the machine guns.
Tactical adjustments include the use of &quot;kill boxes&quot;, or zones that are placed off-limits to ground forces while allied aircraft attack targets, which goes back to the beginning of military aircraft in World War I.

The shock and awe battle tactics adopted by the American military – overwhelming power, battlefield awareness, dominant maneuvers, and spectacular displays of force – are employed because they are believed to be the best way to win a war quickly and decisively, reducing casualties on both sides. However, if the only people doing the shooting are American, then a high percentage of total casualties are bound to be the result of friendly fire, blunting the effectiveness of the shock and awe tactic. It is probably the fact that friendly fire has proven to be the only fundamental weakness of the tactics that has caused the American military to take significant steps to overturn a blasé attitude to friendly fire and assess ways to eliminate it.

=== Markings ===

During Operation Husky, codename for the Allied invasion of Sicily, on the night of 11 July 1943, American C-47 transport planes were mistakenly fired upon by American ground and naval forces and 23 planes were shot down and 37 damaged, resulting in 318 casualties, with 60 airmen and 81 paratroopers killed.

This led to the use of Invasion stripes that were used during D-Day as a visible way to prevent friendly fire. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine the Z (military symbol) has been used on Russian vehicles as a form of marking. There are various explanations as to its meaning, however, one is that both sides are using the same equipment. Ukrainian forces have responded by using visible Ukrainian flags on their vehicles. The picture has become more confused as both sides are using captured or abandoned equipment with Ukraine using captured Russian tanks.

==Examples==
Incidents include: the killing of Royalist commander, the Earl of Kingston, by Royalist cannon fire during the English Civil War; the bombing of American troops by Eighth Air Force bombers during Operation Cobra in World War II; the attack on the Royal Navy 1st Minesweeping Flotilla off Cap d&#x27;Antifer, Le Havre by 263 Squadron and 266 Squadron RAF on 27 August 1944, sinking and , and irreparably damaging HMS Salamander, killing 117 sailors and wounding 153 more; the eight-hour firefight between British units during the Cyprus Emergency; the sinking of the German destroyers &quot;Leberecht Maass&quot; and &quot;Max Schultz&quot; by the Luftwaffe in the North Sea during World War II; the downing of a British Army Gazelle helicopter by a British warship during the Falklands War; the downing of two U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters by USAF fighters in 1994 during the Iraqi no-fly zones; the shooting down and killing of Italo Balbo, the Italian governor of Libya over Tobruk by Italian anti aircraft fire in 1940; the accidental shooting of Stonewall Jackson during the American Civil War; the killing of a Royal Military Policeman by a British sniper during the war in Afghanistan; and the Tarnak Farm incident when US Air National Guard pilots in 2002 bombed 12 Canadian soldiers, four of whom were killed; these were the first Canadian casualties of the war in Afghanistan.

<doc id="202485" wikidata="Q1651051" url="?curid=202485" title="Metrical foot">
<text>The foot is the basic repeating rhythmic unit that forms part of a line of verse in most Indo-European traditions of poetry, including English accentual-syllabic verse and the quantitative meter of classical ancient Greek and Latin poetry. The unit is composed of syllables, and is usually two, three, or four syllables in length. The most common feet in English are the iamb, trochee, dactyl, and anapaest. The foot might be compared to a bar, or a beat divided into pulse groups, in musical notation.

The English word &quot;foot&quot; is a translation of the Latin term &quot;pes&quot;, plural &quot;pedes&quot;, which in turn is a translation of the Ancient Greek πούς, pl. πόδες. The Ancient Greek prosodists, who invented this terminology, specified that a foot must have both an arsis and a thesis, that is, a place where the foot was raised (&quot;arsis&quot;) and where it was put down (&quot;thesis&quot;) in beating time or in marching or dancing. The Greeks recognised three basic types of feet, the iambic (where the ratio of arsis to thesis was 1:2), the dactylic (where it was 2:2) and the paeonic (where it was 3:2).

Lines of verse are classified according to the number of feet they contain, e.g. pentameter. However some lines of verse are not considered to be made up of feet, e.g. hendecasyllable.

In some kinds of metre, such as the Greek iambic trimeter, two feet are combined into a larger unit called a metron (pl. metra) or dipody.

The foot is a purely metrical unit; there is no inherent relation to a word or phrase as a unit of meaning or syntax, though the interplay between these is an aspect of the poet&#x27;s skill and artistry.

==Classical meter==
Below listed are the names given to the poetic feet by classical metrics. The feet are classified first by the number of syllables in the foot (&quot;disyllables&quot; have two, &quot;trisyllables&quot; three, and &quot;tetrasyllables&quot; four) and secondarily by the pattern of vowel lengths (in classical languages) or syllable stresses (in English poetry) which they comprise.

The following lists describe the feet in terms of vowel length (as in classical languages). Translated into syllable stresses (as in English poetry), &quot;long&quot; becomes &quot;stressed&quot; (&quot;accented&quot;), and &quot;short&quot; becomes &quot;unstressed&quot; (&quot;unaccented&quot;). For example, an iamb, which is short-long in classical meter, becomes unstressed-stressed, as in the English word &quot;alone&quot;.

<text>RFA &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; (L3005) was a landing ship logistics (LSL) of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, later in service with the Brazilian Navy as the &quot;Garcia D&#x27;Avila&quot;.

==Construction and design==
&quot;Sir Galahad&quot; was ordered on 6 September 1984 to a design by the shipbuilder Swan Hunter, as a replacement for the landing ship of the same name that had been sunk in the 1982 Falklands War. The ship was laid down at Swan Hunter&#x27;s Wallsend shipyard on 12 July 1985, was launched on 13 December 1986 and completed on 19 July 1987, entering service on 7 December that year.

The ship was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of at full load and light. Displacement was light and full load. The ship was powered by two Mirrlees Blackstone K9 Major diesel engines, rated at a total of which drove two propeller shafts, giving a speed of . The ship had a range of .

==Service==
RFA &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; was built by Swan Hunter and entered service in 1988. She was named and given the identical pennant number to the &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; sunk in the Falklands War. Built as a combined landing craft and ferry with two flight decks for helicopters and bow and stern doors, there was capacity for around 400 troops and 3,440 tonnes of supplies.

She was deployed in 1991 for Operation Granby, 1995 in Angola Operation Chantress and in 2003 for Operation Telic to transport supplies. In 2003 &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; transported humanitarian aid, docking in Umm Qasr Port on 28 March 2003, after being delayed while naval mines were cleared.

On 26 April 2007, it was announced that she was to be purchased by Brazil. On 20 July 2006, the ship sailed from Marchwood to Portsmouth, to be decommissioned.

She was commissioned into the Brazilian Navy as &quot;Navio de Desembarque de Carros de Combate (NDCC) &quot;Garcia D&#x27;Avila&quot;&quot; on 4 December 2007.

In Brazilian service, she was responsible for transporting vehicles and supplies to Port-au-Prince in support of United Nations peacekeepers deployed in Haiti during MINUSTAH.

In June 2019 it was announced than the ship will be decommissioned on 29 October 2019.

On 20 February 2024, the Brazilian Navy announced the former RFA Sir Galahad will be used to conduct SINKEX as a target for two helicopter-launched Penguin MK2 MOD7 missiles and a submarine-launched Mk48 torpedo.

The largest settlement within the commune of Schengen is Remerschen after which the commune used to be named. The name of the commune was changed in 2006 to take advantage of Schengen&#x27;s name recognition after the signing of the Schengen Agreement there in 1985. The town of Schengen itself had a population of 678 as of 2024.

Schengen Castle dates from 1390 but was almost completely rebuilt in the 19th century.

<text>Henkelodon was a small mammal of the Upper Jurassic. It was a relatively early member of the extinct order Multituberculata. &quot;Henkelodon&quot; was a European herbivore that lived during the &quot;age of the dinosaurs&quot;. It lies within the suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot; and family Paulchoffatiidae.

The genus &quot;Henkelodon&quot; (&quot;Henkel&#x27;s tooth&quot;) was named by Hahn G. in 1977 based on a single species.

Fossil remains of the species &quot;Henkelodon naias&quot; were discovered in the Kimmeridgian (Upper Jurassic)-age Alcobaça Formation of Guimarota, Portugal. The remains consisted of one upper jaw. According to Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum, 2001, (p. 413), this genus was named in 1987. However, Hahn and Hahn 2000 (p. 105) supports 1977.

<doc id="202496" wikidata="Q357495" url="?curid=202496" title="Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm">
<text>Baron Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm (7 July 1756 in Sjundeå, Nyland, Sweden (now Finland) – 27 December 1813 in Schleswig), was a Swedish statesman. He acted as the de facto regent of Sweden during the minor regency of Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden between 1792 and 1796.

==Early career==
After a brief military career he was appointed Kammarherre to Sophia Magdalena, queen consort of Gustav III of Sweden and subsequently became intimately connected with the king&#x27;s brother, Charles, then duke of Södermanland. He remained in the background throughout the reign of Gustavus III, whom he constantly opposed, particularly through the clandestine Walhalla-orden which he co-founded in Sveaborg. 

He was implicated in the 1789 Conspiracy. In the autumn of 1789, princess Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte prepared to depose Gustav III and place her husband Duke Charles upon the throne. Her ideal was the Swedish Constitution of 1772, which she saw as a good tool for an enlightened aristocracy, and the war and the Union and Security Act had made her a leading part of the opposition. She cooperated with Prince Frederick Adolf, Duke of Östergötland, and Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm. The plan was to force Charles to act as a symbol of the opposition to the Union and Security Act when the time was right. When the time arrived to make Charles act, however, he refused, which effectively discontinued the coup.

He, along with the other malcontents, was imprisoned by Gustav III in 1789.

==Ruler of Sweden==
He was abroad at the time of the king&#x27;s death, but a summons from his friend, now duke regent, speedily recalled him, and in 1793 he was made a member of the Privy Council and one of the &quot;lords of the realm&quot;. At first he seemed inclined to adopt a liberal system, and reintroduced the freedom of the press. He did this solely, however, to reverse the Gustavian system, and persecuted the stalwarts of the late king (e.g. Armfelt, and Toll) with a petty vindictiveness which excited general disgust. In 1794 the discovery of the Armfelt Conspiracy exposed the opposition of the Gustavian Party. 

Towards the end of the regency, Reuterholm inclined towards an alliance with Russia on the basis of a marriage between the young king, Gustav IV of Sweden, and the empress Catherine II&#x27;s granddaughter, Alexandra Pavlovna, an alliance frustrated by the bigotry of the intended groom. At home the Swedish government ended as ultra-reactionary, owing to an insignificant riot in Stockholm which so alarmed Reuterholm that he threatened all printers who printed anything relating to the constitutions of the French Republic or the United States of America with the loss of their privileges. In March 1795 he closed the Swedish Academy because A. G. Silfverstolpe in his inaugural address had ventured to disapprove of the coup d&#x27;état of 1789.

In 1796 he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

==Expulsion==
On the accession of Gustav IV of Sweden on 1 November 1796 Reuterholm was expelled from Stockholm. For the next twelve years he lived abroad under the name of Tempelcreutz. After the revolution of 1809 he returned to Sweden, but was denied all access to Charles XIII, and quit his country for good. He died in Schleswig on 27 December 1813 and was buried in Strängnäs Cathedral in Sweden.

<doc id="202497" wikidata="Q208940" url="?curid=202497" title="Waxwing">
<text>The waxwings are three species of passerine birds classified in the genus Bombycilla. They are pinkish-brown and pale grey with distinctive smooth plumage in which many body feathers are not individually visible, a black and white eyestripe, a crest, a square-cut tail and pointed wings. Some of the wing feathers have red tips, the resemblance of which to sealing wax gives these birds their common name. According to most authorities, this is the only genus placed in the family Bombycillidae, although sometimes the family is extended to include related taxa that are more usually included in separate families: silky flycatchers (Ptiliogonatidae (e.g. &quot;Phainoptila&quot;)), &quot;Hypocolius&quot; (Hypocoliidae), &quot;Hylocitrea&quot; (Hylocitreidae), palmchats (Dulidae) and the Hawaiian honeyeaters (Mohoidae). There are three species: the Bohemian waxwing (&quot;B. garrulus&quot;), the Japanese waxwing (&quot;B. japonica&quot;) and the cedar waxwing (&quot;B. cedrorum&quot;).

Waxwings are not long-distance migrants, but move nomadically outside the breeding season. Waxwings mostly feed on insects in summer and fruit in winter; at times of year when fruit and insects are unavailable, they may also feed on sap, buds, and flowers. They catch insects by gleaning through foliage or in mid-air. They often nest near water, the female building a loose nest at the fork of a branch, well away from the trunk of the tree. She also incubates the eggs, the male bringing her food to the nest, and both sexes help rear the young. Waxwings appear in art and have been mentioned in literature.

==Taxonomy==
The waxwings are the sole genus in the family Bombycillidae. In the past, some other related birds were also included in the family, including the silky-flycatchers (now Ptiliogonatidae), the grey hypocolius (now Hypocoliidae), the palm chat (now Dulidae), and the hylocitrea (now Hylocitreidae); these are all now treated, along with the Mohoidae, in the superfamily Bombycilloidea.

===Species===
=== Etymology ===
&quot;Bombycilla&quot;, the genus name, is Vieillot&#x27;s attempt at Latin for &quot;silktail&quot;, translating the German name &quot;Seidenschwänze&quot;. Vieillot thought that &quot;motacilla&quot;, Latin for wagtails, was derived from &quot;mota&quot; for &quot;move&quot; and &quot;cilla&quot;, which he thought meant &quot;tail&quot;; however, &quot;Motacilla&quot; actually combines &quot;motacis&quot;, a mover, with the diminutive suffix &quot;-illa&quot;. He then combined this &quot;cilla&quot; with the Latin &quot;bombyx&quot;, meaning silk.

==Description==
Waxwings are characterised by soft silky plumage. They have unique red tips to the secondary feathers of the wing (most obvious in adult Bohemian waxwing and cedar waxwing, often absent in Japanese waxwing, and sometimes absent in immatures of the other two), where the shafts extend beyond the barbs; these tips look like sealing wax, and give the group its common name. The legs are short and strong, and the wings are pointed. The male and female have the same plumage. All three species have mainly pale grey-brown plumage, a black line through the eye, and black under the chin, a square-ended tail with a red or yellow tip, and a pointed crest. The bill, eyes, and feet are blackish. The adults moult between August and November, but may suspend their moult and continue after migration. Calls are high-pitched, buzzing or trilling monosyllables.

==Behaviour==

=== Diet ===
These are arboreal birds that breed in northern taiga forests. Their main foods are insects, which they eat in spring and summer (and if available, at other times of the year) and fruit, which they eat from early summer (strawberries, mulberries, and serviceberries) through late summer and autumn (raspberries, blackberries, cherries, and honeysuckle berries) into late autumn and winter (rowan, cotoneaster, viburnum fruit, crabapples, rose hips, dogwood berries, juniper cones, grapes, and mistletoe berries); the juicy berries of rowans are the most important. They pluck fruit from a perch or occasionally while hovering. In spring they replace fruit with sap, buds, and flowers. In warmer periods of the year they catch many insects by gleaning or by flycatching in midair, and often nest near water where flying insects are abundant.

=== Reproduction ===
Waxwings also choose nest sites in places with rich supplies of fruit and breed late in the year to take advantage of summer ripening. However, they may start courting as early as the winter. Pairing includes a ritual in which mates pass a fruit or small inedible object back and forth several times until one eats it (if it is a fruit). After this they may copulate. Many pairs may nest close together in places with good food supplies, and pairs do not defend a territory (perhaps the reason waxwings have no true song), but a bird may attack intruders, perhaps to guard its mate. Both birds gather nest materials, but the female does most of the construction, usually on a horizontal limb or in a crotch well away from the tree trunk, at any height. She makes a loose, bulky nest of twigs, grass, and lichen, which she lines with fine grass, moss, and pine needles and may camouflage with dangling pieces of grass, flowers, lichen, and moss. The female incubates, fed by the male on the nest, but once the eggs hatch, both birds feed the young.

=== Migration ===
They are not true long-distance migrants, but wander erratically outside the breeding season and move south from their summer range in winter. In years with poor berry crops, huge numbers can irrupt well beyond their normal winter range, often in large flocks of hundreds or occasionally even thousands.

<text>The Bohemian waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus) is a starling-sized passerine bird that breeds in the northern forests of the Palearctic and North America. It has mainly buff-grey plumage, black face markings and a pointed crest. Its wings are patterned with white and bright yellow, and some of the wing feathers have red tips, the resemblance of which to sealing wax gives these birds their common name. The two or three subspecies show only minor differences in appearance. Females are similar to males, although young birds are less well-marked and have few or no waxy wingtips. Although the Bohemian waxwing&#x27;s range overlaps those of the cedar and Japanese waxwings, it is easily distinguished from them by size and plumage differences.

The breeding habitat is coniferous forests, usually near water. The pair build a lined cup-shaped nest in a tree or bush, often close to the trunk. The clutch of 3–7 eggs is incubated by the female alone for 13–14 days to hatching. The chicks are altricial and naked, and are fed by both parents, initially mostly with insects, but thereafter mainly fruit. They fledge about 14–16 days after leaving the egg. Many birds desert their nesting range in winter and migrate farther south. In some years, large numbers of Bohemian waxwings well beyond their normal winter range in search of the fruit that makes up most of their diet.

Waxwings can be very tame in winter, entering towns and gardens in search of food, rowan berries being a particular favourite. They can metabolise alcohol produced in fermenting fruit, but can still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Other hazards include predation by birds of prey, infestation by parasites, and collisions with cars or windows. The large numbers and very large breeding area mean that it is classified as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

==Taxonomy==
The waxwings are a family, Bombycillidae, of short-tailed stocky birds with soft plumage, a head crest and distinctively patterned wings and tails. There are three species, the Bohemian, cedar, and Japanese waxwings. DNA studies and shared features such as a relatively large size, grey underparts and similar undertail patterns suggest that the Japanese and Bohemian waxwings are most closely related within the genus. Although only the cedar and Bohemian waxwings normally have red tips on their wing feathers, this feature is occasionally shown by the Japanese waxwing, suggesting that this was originally a whole-family characteristic that has been lost in one species, rather than an indicator of a close relationship. DNA analysis confirms that the cedar waxwing diverged early from the other members of the family. Outside the genus, the closest relatives of the waxwings are believed to be the silky-flycatchers, the palmchat, and the grey hypocolius, all of which have sometimes been included in the Bombycillidae.

The Bohemian waxwing was described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Lanius Garrulus&quot;. The waxwings were moved to their own genus, &quot;Bombycilla&quot;, by Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1808. The genus name &quot;Bombycilla&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;bombux&quot;, &quot;silk&quot; and the Modern Latin &quot;cilla&quot;, &quot;tail&quot;; this is a direct translation of the German &quot;Seidenschwanz&quot;, &quot;silk-tail&quot;, and refers to the silky-soft plumage of the bird. The species name &quot;garrulus&quot; is the Latin for &quot;talkative&quot; and was applied to this bird, as &quot;Garrulus Bohemicus&quot;, by Conrad Gessner in 1555; the term is a reference to a supposed likeness to the Eurasian jay (&quot;Garrulus glandarius&quot;) rather than to the waxwing&#x27;s vocalisations. The English name &quot;waxwing&quot; refers to the bright red tips of the secondary feathers on its wings, which look like drops of sealing wax, while &quot;Bohemian&quot; follows Gessner&#x27;s usage, and may refer to the Romani, alluding to the bird&#x27;s wanderings, or to its presumed origin from Bohemia. The spellings &quot;Waxwing&quot; and &quot;Bohemian waxwing&quot; were first recorded in 1817, the former as a reference to Vieillot&#x27;s separation of this bird from the &quot;chatterers&quot;.

There are two or three recognised subspecies:
*&quot;B. g. garrulus&quot; : the nominate subspecies, breeds in northern Europe from northern Norway east to the Ural Mountains.
*&quot;B. g. centralasiae&quot; : breeds from the Urals eastwards across northern Asia. Included in &quot;B. g. garrulus&quot; by IOC.
*&quot;B. g. pallidiceps&quot; : breeds in northwestern North America.

The differences between these forms are small and clinal, and the species could be possibly considered as monotypic. The fossil record includes Pleistocene deposits from the UK and the Carpathian Mountains.

==Description==

The Bohemian waxwing is a starling-sized bird in length with a wingspan, and an average weight of . It is short-tailed, mainly brownish-grey, and has a conspicuous crest on its head. The male of the nominate subspecies has a black mask through the eye and a black throat. There is a white streak behind the bill and a white curve below the eye. The lower belly is a rich chestnut colour and there are cinnamon-coloured areas around the mask. The rump is grey and the tail ends in a bright yellow band with a broad black border above it. The wings are very distinctive; the flight feathers are black and the primaries in adults have markings that produce a yellow stripe and white &quot;fishhooks&quot; on the closed wing. The adult&#x27;s secondaries end in long red appendages with the sealing wax appearance that gives the bird its English name. The eyes are dark brown, the bill is mainly black, and the legs are dark grey or black. In flight, the waxwing&#x27;s large flocks, long wings and short tail give some resemblance to the common starling, and its flight is similarly fast and direct. It clambers easily through bushes and trees but only shuffles on the ground.

In adults, the primary feathers have a bright yellow leading edge near the tip, and a white &#x27;tick mark&#x27; on the tip of the trailing edge. In males, the yellow tail tip is 6–11 mm broad, the black throat is sharply defined, and there are 6–8 red waxy tips on the secondaries. Females are very similar to males, but have a narrower (4–8 mm) yellow terminal band to the tail, a less defined lower edge to the black throat and slightly fewer red tips, 5–7, on the secondaries. First-winter birds are easily distinguished from adults by the tips of the primaries, which have a white or only very pale yellow leading edge, and no white &#x27;tick mark&#x27; on the trailing edge; they also have a slightly narrower yellow tail tip (5–10 mm in males, 2–6 mm in females), and fewer red wax tips on the secondaries, 4–6(–8) in males and (0–)1–5 in females. The juvenile plumage, only seen on the far northern breeding grounds, is markedly duller than adult plumage, with streaky, whiter underparts, no black on the throat, and a smaller black face mask; juveniles moult into first-winter plumage soon after fledging, before the end of the summer.

Compared to the nominate subspecies, eastern &quot;B. g. centralasiae&quot; is paler, greyer and has little reddish-brown behind the bill. The American subspecies &quot;B. g. pallidiceps&quot; has more colouring on the cheeks and forehead than the nominate form and is otherwise generally duller in appearance.
The soft, dense feathers are kept in good condition by preening. The red waxy tips are the extended and flattened ends of feather shafts, pigmented with astaxanthin and enclosed in a transparent sheath. A study of the cedar waxwings showed that the red tips are few or absent until the third year of life for that related species. All adult waxwings have a complete moult annually between August and January. Juveniles moult at the same time but retain their flight and some other wing feathers.

The range of the Bohemian waxwing overlaps those of both the other members of the genus. The cedar waxwing is smaller than the Bohemian; it has browner upperparts, a white undertail and a white line above the black eye patch, and lacks the white and yellow marks on the wings. Adult cedar waxwings have a yellowish belly, and all ages have less strongly patterned wings than the Bohemian waxwing. The Japanese waxwing is easily distinguished from its relatives; it has a red terminal band to the tail, the black mask extends up the rear of the crest, and there is no yellow stripe and few or no red tips on the wings.

The Bohemian waxwing&#x27;s call is a high trill &quot;sirrrr&quot;. It is less wavering and lower-pitched than that of the cedar waxwing, and longer and lower-pitched than the call of the Japanese waxwing. Other calls are just variants of the main vocalisation; a quieter version is used by chicks to call parents, and courtship calls, also given during nest construction, have a particularly large frequency range. Although not a call as such, when a flock takes off or lands, the wings make a distinctive rattling sound that can be heard away.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Bohemian waxwing has a circumpolar distribution, breeding in northern regions of Eurasia and North America. In Eurasia, its northern nesting limit is just short of the treeline, roughly at the 10 °C July isotherm, and it breeds south locally to about 51°N. Most birds breed between 60–67°N, reaching 70°N in Scandinavia. The North American subspecies breeds in the northwestern and north central areas of the continent, its range extending southwards beyond the US border in the Rocky Mountains.

This waxwing is migratory with much of the breeding range abandoned as the birds move south for the winter. Migration starts in September in the north of the range, a month or so later farther south. Eurasian birds normally winter from eastern Britain through northern parts of western and central Europe, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and northern China to Japan. North American breeders have a more southeasterly trend, many birds wintering in southeast Canada, with smaller numbers in the north central and northeastern US states. Birds do not usually return to the same wintering sites in successive years. One bird wintering in Ukraine was found to the east in Siberia in the following year.

In some years, this waxwing irrupts south of its normal wintering areas, sometimes in huge numbers. The fruit on which the birds depend in winter varies in abundance from year to year, and in poor years, particularly those following a good crop the previous year, the flocks move farther south until they reach adequate supplies. They will stay until the food runs out and move on again. In what may be the largest ever irruption in Europe, in the winter of 2004–2005, more than half a million waxwings were recorded in Germany alone. This invasion followed an unusually warm, dry breeding season. In 1908, an American flock wide was noted as taking two to three minutes to fly over.

The breeding habitat is mature conifers, often spruce although other conifers and broadleaf trees may also be present. More open, wet areas such as lakes and peat swamps with dead and drowned trees are used for feeding on insects. Lowlands, valleys and uplands are used in Eurasia, although mountains tend to be avoided. However, the North American subspecies nests in Canada at altitudes between . Outside the breeding season, the waxwing will occupy a wide range of habitats as long as suitable fruit such as rowan are available. It may be found by roads, in parks and gardens or along hedges or woodlands edges. It shows little fear of humans at this time. In winter, waxwings roost communally in dense trees or hedges, sometimes with American robins, fieldfares or other wintering species.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===

Bohemian waxwings start their return from the wintering grounds in February or March, but northern breeders do not reach their breeding areas until April or early May. This monogamous species nests mainly from mid-June to July.

Waxwings are not highly territorial, and, although normally solitary breeders, several pairs may nest close together where there are a number of good nest sites. Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates, and females may squabble over nest sites. Aggression is shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest, showing the black throat, and opening the bill. The breeding display is almost the opposite of this; the male erects his body and crest feathers, and turns his head away from the female. The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item, often food, to his partner, placing it in her open bill. In about 90% of cases, this display does not lead to copulation. Older males have more red tips to the wings and are preferred by females.

The nest, built by both sexes, is a cup of thin twigs lined with softer material such as fine grass, moss, fur or lichen. It is constructed above the ground in a pine or scrub, commonly close to the trunk. The eggs are a glossy pale blue spotted with black and grey and the clutch is 3–7 eggs, although five or six is most common. The average size of the egg is , and it weighs , of which 5% is shell. The eggs are incubated for 13–14 days by the female alone. She is fed regurgitated berries by her mate, and rarely leaves the nest. The chicks are altricial and naked, and have bright red mouths; they are fed by both parents, although the male brings most of the food, mainly insects, in the first few days. The young are subsequently fed largely with fruit. The chicks fledge about 14–16 days after hatching. They are fed by the adults for about two weeks after fledging.

Breeding densities of this waxwing are typically low compared to other passerines, usually less than ten birds per square kilometre (26 per square mile) even in good habitat, although up to 35·6 birds per square kilometre (92 per square mile) have been found in Russia. One brood each year is normal. Maximum recorded ages are 5 years 10 months in North America and more than 13 years 6 months in Europe. The average life expectancy is unknown. Significant causes of death include predation, collisions with windows and cars, and poisoning by road salt consumed when drinking.

===Feeding===

Waxwings are primarily fruit eaters in the winter, and consume insects when available, particularly during the breeding season but also on any mild days in autumn and winter. Mosquitoes and midges are the most common prey, but many other insects and some spiders are eaten. They are caught mainly by flycatching from an open perch, but some, particularly aphids, may be picked off vegetation. Fruit is normally picked from trees, sometimes from the ground, and is usually swallowed whole. In the summer, &quot;Vaccinium&quot; and &quot;Rubus&quot; species and Canada buffaloberry are important items of their diet, while cotoneaster, juniper, haws, rose hips and apples predominate outside the breeding season. Rowan berries are a favourite food, and are eaten whenever available.

Waxwings can eat huge numbers of berries, each bird sometimes consuming several hundred a day, more than double its own weight. One individual was recorded as eating between 600 and 1,000 cotoneaster berries in six hours, and defecating every four minutes. Waxwings travel significant distances when feeding and help to disperse the fruit seeds. Waxwings forage in large flocks, sometimes of several hundred birds, which enables them to overwhelm birds such as mistle thrushes attempting to defend their fruit trees.

Fruit is rich in sugar but deficient in other nutrients, so it must be eaten in large quantities. Bohemian waxwings have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, many fruit species are juicier, and water is less of a problem.

In the past, the arrival of waxwings sometimes coincided with epidemics of cholera or plague, and led to the old Dutch and Flemish name &quot;Pestvogel&quot;, &quot;plague bird&quot;. The juniper berries on which they fed were thought to offer protection, and people consumed the fruit and burned branches to fumigate their houses.

==Predators and parasites==

Waxwings are preyed upon by birds of prey including rough-legged buzzards, Eurasian sparrowhawks, prairie falcons, and great grey shrikes. Merlins attack winter flocks, including those in cities. When alarmed, Bohemian waxwings &quot;freeze&quot; with bill and neck pointing upwards. If this fails, they fly, calling noisily.

Bohemian waxwings are not brood parasitised by the common cuckoo or its relatives in Eurasia because the cuckoo&#x27;s young cannot survive on a largely fruit diet. In North America, the waxwing&#x27;s breeding range has little overlap with brown-headed cowbird, another parasitic species. Nevertheless, eggs of other birds placed in a Bohemian waxwing&#x27;s nest are always rejected. This suggests that in the past, perhaps 3 million years ago, the ancestral waxwing was a host of a brood parasitic species, and retains the rejection behaviour acquired then.

Parasitic mites include &quot;Syringophiloidus bombycillae&quot;, first identified on this species, and the nasal mite &quot;Ptilonyssus bombycillae&quot;. Blood parasites include &quot;Trypanosoma&quot; species, and a &quot;Leucocytozoon&quot; first identified in this waxwing. Bohemian waxwings may carry flatworms and tapeworms, but levels of parasitic worm infestation are generally low.

==Status==

The global population of the Bohemian waxwing has been estimated at more than three million birds, and the breeding range covers about 12.8 million km2 (4.9 million mi2). Although this species&#x27; population, as of 2013, appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid nor large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and huge breeding area, this waxwing is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. The woodlands used by this species are well to the north of major human populations, and the birds can use disturbed habitats, so there are no serious long-term threats to this species.

<text>Kielanodon is an extinct mammal of the Portuguese Upper Jurassic. It was a relatively early member of the also extinct order of Multituberculata. It eked out a living during the Mesozoic era, also known as the &quot;Age of the Dinosaurs.&quot; It is in the suborder Plagiaulacida, family Paulchoffatiidae.

The genus &quot;Kielanodon&quot;, meaning &quot;Kielan’s tooth&quot; after Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, was named by Hahn G. in 1987. The main species, &quot;Kielanodon hopsoni&quot;, also named by Hahn, is known from fossils found in the Kimmeridgian (Upper Jurassic)-age strata of Guimarota, Portugal. The identification is based on three upper jaws.

<text>Meketibolodon is a genus of extinct mammal from the Kimmeridgian (Upper Jurassic) Camadas de Guimarota of Guimarota, Portugal. It was a relatively early member of the also extinct order Multituberculata, suborder Plagiaulacida, family Paulchoffatiidae. The genus was named by Hahn G. in 1993 based on nine specimens of lower jaw. The type species is &quot;Pseudobolodon robustus&quot; Hahn 1978.

&quot;&quot;Meketibolodon&quot; (Hahn 1993) is distinguished from the other genera [of Paulchoffatiidae] by two characters: the tooth row is significantly convexly curved upwards, and the corpus mandibulae has angled margins ventrally (Hahn and Hahn 1998b). The incisor is more strongly curved than it is the case in &quot;Paulchoffatia&quot;, and its root is longer. The corpus mandibulae is similarly massive to that in &quot;Paulchoffatia&quot;&quot; (Hahn and Hahn 2000, p. 105). The corpus mandibulae is the part of the lower jaw beneath the tooth row, and &quot;mekéti&quot; (μηκέτι) is Greek for &#x27;no longer&#x27;.

<doc id="202508" wikidata="Q296745" url="?curid=202508" title="Oil-for-Food Programme">
<text>The Oil-for-Food Programme (OIP) was established by the United Nations in 1995 (under UN Security Council Resolution 986) to allow Iraq to sell oil on the world market in exchange for food, medicine, and other humanitarian needs for ordinary Iraqi citizens without allowing Iraq to boost its military capabilities.

The programme was introduced by United States President Bill Clinton&#x27;s administration in 1995, as a response to arguments that ordinary Iraqi citizens were inordinately affected by the international economic sanctions aimed at the demilitarisation of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq, imposed in the wake of the first Gulf War. The sanctions were discontinued on 21 November 2003 after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and the humanitarian functions turned over to the Coalition Provisional Authority.

The programme was &quot;de facto&quot; terminated in 2003 and &quot;de jure&quot; terminated in 2010. Although the sanctions were effective, there were revelations of widespread corruption in the programme and abuse of its funds.

==Background and design==
The Oil-for-Food Programme was instituted to relieve the extended suffering of civilians as the result of the United Nations&#x27; imposition of comprehensive sanctions on Iraq following Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Security Council Resolution 706 of 15 August 1991 was introduced to allow the sale of Iraqi oil in exchange for food.

Security Council Resolution 712 of 19 September 1991 confirmed that Iraq could sell up to US$1.6 billion in oil to fund an Oil-For-Food Programme. After an initial refusal, Iraq signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in May 1996 for arrangements to be taken to implement that resolution.

The Oil-for-Food Programme started in December 1996, and the first shipments of food arrived in March 1997. Sixty percent of Iraq&#x27;s twenty-six million people were solely dependent on rations from the oil-for-food plan.

The programme used an escrow system. Oil exported from Iraq was paid for by the recipient into an escrow account possessed until 2001 by BNP Paribas bank, rather than to the Iraqi government. The money was then apportioned to pay for war reparations to Kuwait, ongoing coalition and United Nations operations within Iraq. The remainder, the majority of the revenue, was available to the Iraqi government to purchase regulated items.

The Iraqi government was permitted to purchase only items that were not embargoed under the economic sanctions. Certain items, such as raw foodstuffs, were expedited for immediate shipment, but requests for most items, including simple things such as pencils and folic acid, were reviewed in a process that typically took six months before shipment was authorized. Items deemed to have any potential application in chemical, biological or nuclear weapons systems development were not available to the regime, regardless of stated purpose.

==Financial statistics==
Over US$53 billion worth of Iraqi oil was sold on the world market. About US$46 billion of this was intended to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people such as food and medicine, given the context of international economic sanctions. A considerable portion was spent on Gulf War reparations paid through a compensation fund (25% starting December 2000). UN administrative and operational costs for the programme was US$1.2 billion; the cost of the weapons inspection programme was also paid from these funds. Internal audits have not been made public.

==End of the programme==

Shortly before US-led Coalition forces launched an invasion of Iraq, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan suspended the programme and evacuated more than 300 workers monitoring the distribution of supplies.

On 28 March 2003, Annan, the United States, and Britain asked the UN Security Council to ensure that nearly US$10 billion in goods Iraq had ordered and that were already approved—including US$2.4 billion for food—could enter the country once conditions allowed. The resolution under discussion made clear that the chief responsibility for addressing humanitarian consequences of the war would fall to the United States and Britain if they took control of the country. Under the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention these are the responsibilities of the occupying power.

On 22 May 2003, UN Security Council Resolution 1483 granted authority to the Coalition Provisional Authority to use Iraq&#x27;s oil revenue. The programme&#x27;s remaining funds, $10 billion, were transferred over a six-month winding-up period to the Development Fund for Iraq under the Coalition Provisional Authority&#x27;s control; this represented 14% of the programme&#x27;s total income over 5 years.

The programme was formally terminated on 21 November 2003 and its major functions were turned over to the Coalition Provisional Authority.

==Abuse==
The programme also suffered from widespread corruption and abuse. Throughout its existence, the programme was dogged by accusations that some of its profits were unlawfully diverted to the government of Iraq and to UN officials. These accusations were made in many countries, including the US and Norway.

Until 2001, the money for the Oil-for-Food Programme went through BNP Paribas, whose main private share-holder is Iraqi-born Nadhmi Auchi, a man whose estimated worth is about $1 billion according to &quot;Forbes&quot; estimates, the 13th-richest man in Britain according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Auchi received a 15-month suspended sentence for his involvement in the Elf scandal, which the British newspaper called &quot;the biggest fraud inquiry in Europe since the Second World War&quot;, saying &quot;Elf became a private bank for its executives who spent £200 million on political favours, mistresses, jewellery, fine art, villas and apartments&quot;. Elf, an oil company, merged with TotalFina to become Total S.A. in 2003.

=== Misapplication of funding ===
According to information from Aqila al-Hashimi, who was senior bureaucrat with the Oil-for-Food Programme in Iraq, of the programme&#x27;s total of $60 billion, &quot;roughly 65% was actually applied to aid&quot;. Over 193 so-called electrical consultants each received $15,000 per month while the electricity only worked a few hours at a time.

Benon Sevan of Cyprus, who headed the programme, defended it, claiming that it had only a 2.2% administrative cost and that it was subject to more than 100 internal and external audits. He blamed Security Council restrictions for making the situation difficult and said that 90 percent of Iraq&#x27;s population relied on the programme for its monthly food basket. Sevan stonewalled efforts to review and investigate the programme. He ordered his staff to enforce a policy that complaints about illegal payoffs should be formally filed with the whistleblower&#x27;s country, making them public and allowing Iraq to bar any whistleblowers. In 2000, Dileep Nair, the UN corruption watchdog, wanted to determine the programme&#x27;s level of vulnerability. Sevan and UN Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette, rejected any such investigation, claiming that it would be too expensive to be worthwhile. UN Chef de Cabinet Iqbal Riza ordered the shredding of years&#x27; worth of documents in his office concerning the programme. He said that they were from a working file that contained copies of documents received by his office, and were purged due to lack of space, and also that the originals were held elsewhere.

In response to these criticisms, and to evidence acquired after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, accusations were made that skimmed profits were being used to buy influence at the UN and with Kofi Annan himself. An investigation cleared Annan of any personal wrongdoing.

=== Adulterated foods ===
According to an interim report released on 3 February 2005 by former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker&#x27;s commission (see Investigations below), much of the food aid supplied under the programme &quot;was unfit for human consumption&quot;. The report concluded that Sevan had accepted nearly $150,000 in bribes over the course of the programme, and in 2005 he was suspended from his position at the United Nations as a result of the fraud investigation.

===&quot;Al Mada&quot; list===
One of the earliest allegations of wrongdoing in the programme surfaced on 25 January 2004, when &quot;al Mada&quot;, a daily newspaper in Iraq, published a list of individuals and organizations alleged to have received oil sales contracts via the UN&#x27;s Oil-for-Food Programme. The list came from over 15,000 documents which were reportedly found in the state-owned Iraqi oil corporation, the Iraq National Oil Company, which had close links to the Iraqi Oil Ministry.

Named in the list of beneficiaries were George Galloway, then a British Member of Parliament (MP), and his charity, the Mariam Appeal; former French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua; Shaker al-Kaffaji, an Iraqi-American businessman; Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh, and Bheem Singh. Many prominent Russian firms and individuals were also included on the &quot;al Mada&quot; list. Even the Russian Orthodox Church was supposedly involved in illegal oil trading. The former assistant to the Vatican secretary of state, Reverend Jean-Marie Benjamin, is said to have received the rights to sell . George Galloway subsequently won two libel actions against the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; and &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, which had reported the allegations.

The president of Oilexco Ltd, Arthur Millholland, whose name also appeared on the &quot;al Mada&quot; list, denied wrongdoing but confirmed that illegal surcharges were being paid to the Iraqi government by contractors. Few deny that in Iraq, like in many third-world countries, bribes and kickbacks were regularly paid to the leadership in order to get contracts; however, the &quot;al Mada&quot; list does not discuss bribes paid to Iraq – it discusses bribes paid to individuals to support Iraq.

===Operation of the scheme===
The scheme is alleged to have worked in this way: individuals and organizations sympathetic to the Iraqi regime, or those just easily bribed, were offered oil contracts through the Oil-for-Food Programme. These contracts for Iraqi oil could then be sold on the open world market and the seller was allowed to keep a transaction fee, said to be between $0.15 and $0.50/barrel (0.94 and 3.14 $/m3) of oil sold. The seller was then to refund the Iraqi government a certain percentage of the commission.

Contracts to sell Iraq humanitarian goods through the Oil-for-Food Programme were given to companies and individuals based on their willingness to kick back a certain percentage of the contract profits to the Iraqi regime. Companies that sold commodities via the Oil-for-Food Programme were overcharging by up to 10%, with part of the overcharged amount being diverted into private bank accounts for Saddam Hussein and other regime officials and the other part being kept by the supplier.

The involvement of the UN itself in the scandal began in February 2004 after the name of Benon Sevan, executive director of the Oil-for-Food Programme, appeared on the Iraqi Oil Ministry&#x27;s documents. Sevan received vouchers for at least 11,000,000 barrels (1,700,000 m3) of oil, worth some $3.5 million in profit. Sevan denied the charges.

===BNP Paribas===
The sole bank handling funds transfers for the Oil-for-Food Programme was the New York branch of the Banque Nationale de Paris-Paribas, or BNP Paribas. This French bank was the sole bank administering the $64 billion UN programme. An investigation by the US House Committee on International Relations found that BNP Paribas made payments for goods without proof of delivery and allowed payments to third parties not identified as authorized recipients. Investigators estimate that the bank received more than $700 million in fees under the UN programme, which began in 1996 and ended after the ouster of Saddam in March 2003.

===Duelfer Report===
The Iraq Survey Group, which was tasked with finding evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, found that OFF saved the Iraqi economy from decline after the imposition of sanctions. Furthermore, the Iraqi regime found that it could corrupt OFF to get hard currency that could be used to manipulate the Iraq Sanctions Committee and undermine sanctions as well as to obtain more weapons.

The final official version of the Iraq Survey Group report, known as the Duelfer Report, cited only France, Russia and China (countries who were also strongly anti-war) as violators who paid kickbacks. According to the report, the top three recipients of oil included Russia (30%), France (15%), and China (10%), which are all members of the UN Security Council. The US received 2–3% of the oil. US recipients included ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco Corp. and the El Paso Corp. The list of US companies was originally censored by CIA lawyers, citing privacy issues, but was later leaked.

On 5 June 2007, the German chapter of the anti-corruption organisation Transparency International (TI) lodged a complaint with the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) against 57 German companies for allegedly paying $11.9m in kickbacks in the United Nations&#x27; Oil for Food Programme in Iraq.

===Oil coupons as bribes===
The US-funded satellite network Al Hurra broadcast a story on 6 January 2005 detailing allegations that Saddam&#x27;s regime had bribed news reporters with oil coupons. Reporters named include Ahmed Mansour of Al Jazeera and , a writer based in France known for her pro-Saddam positions. Two types of oil coupons were used: silver coupons that entitled holders to nine million barrels of oil, and gold coupons worth more. Hamida Naanaa is said to have received a gold coupon.

===Ingersoll-Rand pays $2.5m in fines for kickbacks===

In October 2007, the SEC brought a case against Ingersoll-Rand alleging kickbacks by three different subsidiaries to Iraqi Government officials. Ingersoll-Rand&#x27;s German subsidiary ABG, subsidiary I-R Italiana and the Irish subsidiary Thermo King paid &quot;after-sales service fees&quot; (ASSFs), although no bona fide services were performed. Ingersoll-Rand, without admitting or denying the allegations in the commission&#x27;s complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge $1,710,034 in profits, plus $560,953 in pre-judgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $1,950,000. Ingersoll-Rand was also ordered to comply with certain undertakings regarding its compliance program for the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and to pay a $2,500,000 fine pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section.

===Complaints by Kurds===
The Iraqi Kurds complained since the programme began that they were not being paid their fair share of the oil revenues. According to the guidelines set up by the Oil-for-Food Programme, the revenues were to be divided up in such a way as to protect Iraq&#x27;s predominantly Kurdish regions. The allegations include claims that the Cairo office of the UN&#x27;s World Health Organization, run by an individual alleged to have received oil sales contracts, managed to stall the building of a new general hospital for the Kurdish city of Sulaymaniya, even though the funds for the project had been available since 1998.

===Potential Annan link===
On 14 June 2005, two 1998 memos surfaced that appeared to link Kofi Annan to Cotecna Inspection S.A. The first one described a meeting between Annan and Cotecna while the company was bidding on the programme, after which the company raised its bid. A second one mentioned that Cotecna was confident that they would get the bid due to &quot;effective but quiet lobbying&quot; in New York diplomatic circles. The source of the documents was a Cotecna executive.

The Second Interim Report by the IIC confirmed that Cotecna won the Oil for Food contract fairly and based on merit. The Committee concluded that there was no link between Kofi Annan and the award of Cotecna&#x27;s contract, and Cotecna has been transparent and cooperative through this investigation.

===Alleged involvement of Russian intelligence===
According to high-ranking Russian SVR defector Sergei Tretyakov, the Oil-for-Food Programme was sabotaged by an undercover Russian intelligence officer, Alexander Kramar, a UN employee who set up the artificially low oil prices in 1998 to allow Saddam to use the oil vouchers as lucrative bribes. The difference between the market price and the price defined by Kramar was pocketed by people who received the vouchers from Saddam. Among the bribed were top officials from Russia, France, and China. The biggest part of vouchers (to buy of oil) went to forty-six individuals or organizations in Russia, including the Russian Orthodox Church. They pocketed $476 million. Among Russians who received the money were Alexander Voloshin and Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Sergei Isakov, a friend of Voloshin, carried &quot;bags with money&quot; from Moscow to Baghdad taking the &quot;earned&quot; money as kickbacks to Saddam.

===Alleged use for financing of Saddam Hussein regime===
Fox News broke the story that Alexander Yakovlev, a Russian official in the UN Procurement Department, was involved; he later resigned and pleaded guilty to corruption charges. The program was also linked to Ahmed Idris Nasreddin, designated as a terrorist financier by Britain, the US and according to the UN &quot;belonging to or affiliated with Al Qaeda.&quot; Nasreddin was removed from these lists in 2007 after he demonstrated that he had severed all business ties with Youssef Nada, who co-founded the Al Taqwa Bank with him, and pledged to have no further dealings with either Nada or the bank. Petra Navigation Group was a company that was on the blacklist of firms blocked from doing business with the U.S. for sanctions-busting activities designed to help Saddam&#x27;s regime.

According to some sources, Saddam provided millions of dollars from the Oil-for-Food program to the Mujahedin-e-Khalq.

===Oil for wheat===
A report by UN investigator Paul Volcker released in October 2005 found that the Australian Wheat Board, later AWB Limited, was the biggest single source of kickbacks for the Iraqi government. In exchange for trouble-free disembarkation of wheat purchased under the Oil-for-Food Programme, the Australian Wheat Board paid &#x27;trucking charges&#x27; totalling A$300 million to Alia. Alia is a real Jordanian trucking company, but one with no role in the distribution of Australian wheat in Iraq. Alia kept a small percentage of &#x27;charges&#x27;, and passed the remainder on to Saddam&#x27;s government. The AWB was fully compensated for the charges by increases in the price paid; the payments were approved by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Australian Government commissioned judge Terence Cole to further investigate whether Australian companies had indeed paid kickbacks to the Saddam regime. The Cole Inquiry commenced in December 2005.

The Cole Inquiry has received testimony from senior Australian Government officials, including Prime Minister John Howard, Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and various officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. During the course of the inquiry numerous AWB officials have resigned, including managing director Andrew Lindberg.
 In 2009, the Australian Federal Police ended the investigation related to the scandal.

==Investigations==

===GAO investigation===
After the 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent Coalition victory over the Iraqi Army, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) was given the task of finalizing all Oil-for-Food-related supply contracts made with the now-defunct regime and of tracking down the personal fortunes of former regime members. During the execution of this task, the GAO found weaknesses in the programme that allowed kickbacks and other sources of wealth for Saddam Hussein. The GAO estimates that the Saddam Hussein regime generated $10.1 billion in illegal revenues. This figure includes $5.7 billion from oil smuggling and $4.4 billion in illicit surcharges on oil sales and after-sales charges on suppliers. The scale of the fraud was far more extensive than the GAO had previously estimated. A U.S. Department of Defense study, cited by the GAO, evaluated 759 contracts administered through the Oil-for-Food Programme and found that nearly half had been overpriced, by an average of 21 percent. Unlike the 661 committee, members of the Security Council had the authority to launch investigations into contracts and to stop any contract they did not like. The British and the Americans had turned down hundreds of Oil-for-Food contract requests, but these were blocked primarily on the grounds that the items being imported were dual-use technologies.

To quote the GAO report, in its summary:

: Both the UN Secretary-General, through the Office of the Iraqi Programme (OIP) and the Security Council, through its sanctions committee for Iraq, were responsible for overseeing the Oil-for-Food Programme. However, the Iraqi government negotiated contracts directly with purchasers of Iraqi oil and suppliers of commodities, which may have been one important factor that allowed Iraq to levy illegal surcharges and commissions.

Joseph A. Christoff, director of international affairs and trade at the General Accounting Office, told a House hearing that UN auditors had refused to release the internal audits of the Oil-for-Food Programme. Benon Sevan, with support from Kofi Annan, had written letters to all former Oil-for-Food contractors asking them to consult Sevan before releasing any documents to GAO or US congressional inquiry panels. Throughout its history, the programme had received both complaints from critics saying that it needed to be more open and complaints from companies about proprietary information being disclosed.

The United Nations has denied all requests by the GAO for access to confidential internal audits of the Oil-for-Food Programme.

While attempting to determine the complexity of the Oil-for-Food Programme for articles in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, investigative journalist Claudia Rosett of the Foundation for the Defence of Democracies and the Hudson Institute discovered that the UN treated details such as the identities of Oil-for-Food contractors; the price, quantity and quality of goods involved in the relief deals; and the identities of the oil buyers and the precise quantities that they received as confidential. The bank statements, the interest paid, and the transactions were all secret as well. Rosett has come under harsh criticism from Denis Halliday and Benon Sevan, who have claimed that many of Rosett&#x27;s claims (such as Oil-for-Food funding the approval of an Olympic stadium, and where responsibility for various issues lay according to the UN resolutions) were incorrect.

The US House Committee on International Relations investigated the Oil-for-Food Programme and discovered that money was provided by Sabah Yassen, the former Iraqi ambassador to Jordan, to pay the families of Palestinian suicide bombers between $15,000 to $25,000. From September 2000 until the invasion of Iraq, the families of Palestinians killed or wounded in the conflict with Israel (including 117 responsible for suicide bombings in Israel) received over $35 million. It is alleged that this money came from the UN Oil-for-Food Programme.

===Independent Inquiry Committee===
After initial opposition to an investigation, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated on 19 March 2004 that a full independent investigation would be launched. In an official press interview, Annan said &quot;[...] it is highly possible that there has been quite a lot of wrongdoing, but we need to investigate [...] and see who was responsible.&quot; &quot;00:00:03&quot;. () However, Annan was emphatic that most of the claims were &quot;outrageous and exaggerated&quot;, and that most of the criticisms had to do with things over which the programme had no authority.

The following individuals were chosen in April 2004 to head the United Nations&#x27; &quot;Independent Inquiry Committee&quot;:
*Paul Volcker, former United States Federal Reserve System chairman and director of the United Nations Association of the United States of America;
*Mark Pieth of Switzerland, an expert on money-laundering in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD); and
*Richard Goldstone of South Africa, former Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).

On 22 April 2004, the United Nations Security Council passed a unanimous resolution endorsing the Volcker inquiry into corruption in the United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme for Iraq, calling upon all 191 member states to cooperate.

The definitive report was presented by Paul Volcker to the Security Council on 7 September 2005.

A leaked internal UN audit, which surfaced on mineweb.com, shows massive discrepancies between Cotecna reports and UN agency reports for the value of the shipments into northern Iraq. The audit found that Cotecna did no &quot;value&quot; inspections on nearly US$1 billion worth of aid shipments for the Inter-Agency Humanitarian Programme into northern Iraq. However, in a subsequent report published by the Independent Inquiry Committee (IIC) (27 October 2005) it was concluded that &quot;there were no major complaints by the United Nations or its member states about Cotecna&#x27;s performance&quot; and that &quot;the audit did not report any deficiencies in Cotecna&#x27;s inspections&quot;. Benon Sevan was briefed in December 2002 on the findings of the audit.

The audit is available here. Its summary states:

:OIOS&#x27; overall conclusion is that the management of the Contract has not been adequate and certain provisions of the Contract had not been adhered to. In addition, the incorporation of additional costs, such as rehabilitation of camps in the man-day-rate was an unacceptable arrangement. Also, the contract had been amended prior to its commencement, which was inappropriate. OIP needs to strengthen its management of contracts and the Procurement Division (PD) should ensure that the basis of payment is appropriate in order to avoid additional costs to the Organization

After reading the leaked audit, congressman Henry Hyde wrote to Kofi Annan wondering why &quot;The U.S. Congress – which provides 22 percent of the U.N.&#x27;s budget and which has publicly requested copies of the 55 internal audits – should be required to depend on media leaks for source documents.&quot;

====Interim report results====
In a 219-page initial report, the Volcker Commission documented how OIF chairman Benon Sevan used his position to solicit and receive allocations of oil from Iraq during the years he oversaw the humanitarian relief programme. Internal records from SOMO (Iraq&#x27;s State Oil Marketing Organization), as well as interviews with former Iraqi officials involved in illicit oil deals, show that Sevan had requested and received allocations of of oil on behalf of a Panama-registered trading company called African Middle East Petroleum Co.

Although the report makes no specific allegations of criminal activity by Sevan, Volcker does not rule out the possibility that charges might be filed by authorities in countries with relevant jurisdiction. The report called Sevan&#x27;s conduct &quot;ethically improper&quot;, noting that Sevan had received large cash payments totalling $160,000 each year he had headed the programme. Sevan claims the money came from an aunt in Cyprus who has since died, but the panel found no evidence to back this claim.

Volcker also reported in January that a review of 58 confidential UN internal OIF audits showed UN officials ignored early signs that humanitarian goods shipped to Iraq before the 2003 Invasion war were given little if any inspections by the Swiss company Cotecna. However, Volker concluded on 27 October 2005 IIC report that &quot;the audit did not report any deficiencies in Cotecna&#x27;s inspections&quot;. Cotecna paid Kojo Annan, Kofi Annan&#x27;s son, consulting fees until November 2003. Volcker said that future reports would deal with questions regarding Kojo Annan.

===Investigations by Iraqi Governing Council===
International accounting firm KPMG had been selected by the Iraqi Governing Council to investigate the &quot;al Mada claims&quot;, along with Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. It was due to release its findings to the Iraqi Governing Council in May 2004. However, in June 2004, KPMG stopped working on the project because it was owed money by the IGC.

The US has been harshly critical of the KPMG probe led by associates of Ahmed Chalabi, accusing it of undermining the main probe established by Paul Bremer. That probe had been run by the head of Iraq&#x27;s independent Board of Supreme Audit, Ehsan Karim, with assistance from Ernst &amp; Young. The Board of Supreme Audit is within the Iraqi Finance Ministry. In June 2004, Karim&#x27;s investigation agreed to share information with the Volcker panel. However, on 1 July 2004, Karim was killed by a bomb magnetically attached to his car.

Claude Hankes-Drielsma, a British national and long-time friend of Ahmed Chalabi, was appointed by the IGC to coordinate its investigation of the Oil-for-Food Programme. Drielsma testified in front of the US Congress (on 21 April 2004) that the KPMG investigation &quot;is expected to demonstrate the clear link between those countries which were quite ready to support Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime for their own financial benefit, at the expense of the Iraqi people, and those that opposed the strict application of sanctions and the overthrow of Saddam&quot;. He also testified that Chalabi was in charge of the investigation for the IGC.

In late May 2004, on the same day that Chalabi&#x27;s offices at the Iraqi National Congress were raided by coalition forces, Drielsma claimed that an individual or individuals hacked into his computer and deleted every file associated with his investigation. He also claimed that &quot;a back-up databank&quot; was also deleted. When asked by Claudia Rosett if he had been physically threatened as well, Drielsma replied with &quot;no comment&quot;. Drielsma has also been an outspoken critic of the UN&#x27;s refusal to release any internal Oil-for-Food audit information to the IGC.

===Criminal investigation in France===
The French criminal justice system is investigating the alleged involvement of two former officials from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jean-Bernard Mérimée and Serge Boidevaix. The two are accused of having used their extensive network of connections in the Arab world in order to commit &quot;influence peddling&quot; and &quot;corruption of foreign public agents&quot;. They have been put under formal criminal investigation by investigating magistrate Philippe Courroye, a famous specialist in cases of corruption and other financial dealings. Both men had retired at the time of the alleged crimes and acted in their personal capacity, not as official envoys of the French government; however, Boidevaix claims that he kept the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed of his actions in Iraq. The Ministry claims to have warned both men formally in 2001 (during the administration of Lionel Jospin).

Some other people, including Bernard Guillet, an aide to French senator Charles Pasqua, are also under formal investigation. Guillet and Pasqua deny any wrongdoing.

===US Senate investigations===
US Senator Norm Coleman called for Kofi Annan to resign over the scandal and held a number of hearings on the matter. The most spectacular of these hearings occurred after the subcommittee released a report that accused (then) British Member of Parliament (MP) George Galloway, Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and former French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua of receiving oil allocations from Iraq in return for being political allies of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime. Galloway, in an unusual appearance of a British MP before a US Senate subcommittee, responded angrily to the allegations against him in a confrontational public hearing which drew much media attention in both America and Britain. Galloway denied the allegations.

It is estimated that as much as $10 billion to $21.3 billion went unaccounted for and/or was directed to Saddam Hussein and his government in the form of kickbacks and oil smuggling. Record keeping of illegal behaviour is hard to come by and rare at best. To date, only 1 of 54 internal UN audits of the Oil-for-Food Programme has been made public. The UN has refused all requests for its audits.

Warren Hoge alleged that the American government was aware of the scandal and chose to not prevent the smuggling because their allies Turkey and Jordan benefited from the majority of the smuggled oil. US Senator Carl Levin (D-Michigan) is quoted in an interview for the &quot;New York Times&quot; as saying, &quot;There is no question that the bulk of the illicit oil revenues came from the open sale of Iraqi oil to Jordan and to Turkey, and that that was a way of going around the Oil-for-Food Programme [and that] we were fully aware of the bypass and looked the other way.&quot;

===Indictments===

On 6 January 2006, South Korean businessman Tongsun Park was arrested by the FBI in Houston after he was indicted for illegally accepting millions of dollars from Iraq in the UN Oil-for-Food Programme. The criminal charges against him were unsealed in a U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

After an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s New York Field Office, on 16 January 2007, Benon Sevan was indicted by prosecutors from the Southern District of New York for taking about $160,000 in bribes. Michael J. Garcia, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, issued a warrant through Interpol for the arrest of Sevan at his home in Cyprus, as well as a warrant for Efraim &quot;Fred&quot; Nadler, a New York businessman who was indicted on charges of channelling the illegal payments to Sevan. Nadler&#x27;s whereabouts are unknown.

===Daimler AG Kickbacks Case===

On 1 April 2010, Daimler AG pleaded guilty to bribery charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and will pay $185 million (US) as settlement, but remains subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement and oversight by an independent monitor. The German automaker of Mercedes-Benz vehicles was accused of violating the terms of the United Nations&#x27; Oil for Food Program with Iraq by including kickbacks 10 percent of the contract values to the Iraqi government. The SEC said the company earned more than $4 million from the sale of vehicles and spare parts.

The SEC case was sparked in 2004 after David Bazzetta, a former auditor at then DaimlerChrysler Corp, filed a whistle-blower complaint after he was fired for raising questions about bank accounts controlled by Mercedes-Benz units in South America. Bazzetta alleged that he learned in a July 2001 corporate audit executive committee meeting in Stuttgart that business units &quot;continued to maintain secret bank accounts to bribe foreign government officials&quot;, though the company knew the practice violated U.S. laws.

The investigation for the case also revealed that Daimler made some $56 million in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in 22 countries that earned the company $1.9 billion in revenue and at least $91.4 million in illegal profits. &quot;Using offshore bank accounts, third-party agents and deceptive pricing practices, these companies [Daimler AG and its subsidiaries] saw foreign bribery as a way of doing business&quot;, said Mythili Raman, a principal deputy in the Justice Department&#x27;s criminal division.

&quot;It is no exaggeration to describe corruption and bribe-paying at Daimler as a standard business practice&quot;, Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC&#x27;s enforcement division, said in a statement.

Judge Richard J. Leon of United States District Court in Washington, approved the plea agreement and settlement, calling it a &quot;just resolution.&quot;

<text>Plesiochoffatia is an extinct mammal of the Upper Jurassic. It was a relatively early member of the also extinct order Multituberculata. It was a resident of Portugal during the &quot;age of the dinosaurs.&quot; It&#x27;s in the suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot; and family Paulchoffatiidae.

The genus &quot;Plesiochoffatia&quot; (&quot;near Choffatia&quot;) was named by Hahn G. and Hahn R. in 1999. It has also been known as &quot;Parachoffatia&quot; (&quot;beside Choffatia&quot;) Hahn &amp; Hahn, 1998 (preoccupied).

Remains have been found in the Kimmeridgian (Upper Jurassic)-age strata of Guimarota, Portugal. Three species were described in the same study under the name of &quot;Parachoffatia&quot;; (&quot;P. peparethos&quot;, &quot;P. staphylos&quot; and &quot;P. thoas&quot;). As something else had already been given that name, the genus was renamed a year later.

<text>Pseudobolodon was a relatively early member of the also extinct order of mammals, Multituberculata. It lived in Portugal during the Upper Jurassic, part of the &quot;age of the dinosaurs.&quot; It lies within the suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot; and family Paulchoffatiidae.

The genus &quot;Pseudobolodon&quot; (&quot;false Bolodon&quot;) was named by Hahn G. in 1977 based on two species. A third one-time species, &quot;P. robustus&quot; (Hahn, 1978), seems to have transformed into &quot;Meketibolodon robustus&quot; (Hahn G. 1978).

The species &quot;Pseudobolodon krebsi&quot; was named by Hahn G. &amp; Hahn R. in 1994. Fossil remains consisting of two upper jaws have been found in the Kimmeridgian (Upper Jurassic)-age strata of Guimarota, Portugal. As for the septomaxilla mentioned in the title of the reference: &quot;A small, triangular bone is placed between the premaxilla and the maxilla; this bone is interpreted as a septomaxilla. This is a bone that is typical for lower tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles), but is usually absent in mammals&quot;, (Hahn &amp; Hahn 2000, p. 98). The premaxilla is the front bit of your upper jaw, while the maxilla is the side of it. Like other existing mammals, humans don&#x27;t have this septomaxilla.

The species &quot;Pseudobolodon oreas&quot; was named by Hahn G. in 1977. Remains consisting of seven upper jaws have been found in Kimmeridgian (Upper Jurassic)-age strata of Guimarota, Portugal.

<text>Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin, (30 July 1914 – 25 April 1999) was an Irish journalist, author, sports official, and the sixth president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). He succeeded his uncle as Baron Killanin in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1927, when he was 12, which allowed him to sit in the House of Lords at the Palace of Westminster as Lord Killanin upon turning 21.

==Early life==
Morris was born in St George Hanover Square, Westminster, the son of Lt. Col. George Morris, an Irish Catholic from Spiddal in Connemara, County Galway. His grandfather was Michael Morris, 1st Baron Killanin, who had served as Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench for Ireland from 1887 to 1889. The Morrises were one of the fourteen families making up the Tribes of Galway. On 1 September 1914, early in the First World War, Killanin&#x27;s father was killed in action near Villers-Cotterêts, France, while commanding the Irish Guards.

His Australian-born mother, Dora Maryon Wesley Hall (1891–1948), was the second-eldest daughter of English-born James Wesley Hall (1839–1901) and Australian Mary Dora Frederica Hall (&quot;née&quot; Dempster; 1864–1895). Wesley Hall was the first general manager of the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company Limited in the Colony of Queensland, Australia, from 1886 to 1891. He was born in Kington, Herefordshire, Great Britain, to Walter Hall, a miller, and Elizabeth Carleton Skarratt. Lord Killanin&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Dora Hall, was born in Williamstown, Colony of Victoria, to William Dempster, a bank manager, and Margaret Herbert Davies.

Killanin was educated at Summerfields, Eton College, the Sorbonne in Paris and then Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he was President of the Footlights dramatic club. In the mid-1930s, he began his career as a journalist on Fleet Street, working for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot; and subsequently the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. In 1937–38, he was war correspondent during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

In July 1927, he succeeded his father&#x27;s older brother Martin Morris to become Baron Killanin, which gave him an hereditary seat in the House of Lords at Westminster as it was a peerage in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==Family==
Lord Killanin married (Mary) Sheila Cathcart Dunlop (1919–2007), MBE, of Oughterard, County Galway, in 1945. She was the granddaughter of Henry Dunlop, who built Lansdowne Road Rugby Ground in Ballsbridge, Dublin, in 1872. Her father was Douglas Canon Lyall Chandler Dunlop, Church of Ireland Rector of Oughterard. Lord and Lady Killanin had three sons: George Redmond (&quot;Red&quot;), Michael (&quot;Mouse&quot;), and John (&quot;Johnny&quot;), and a daughter, Monica Deborah.

==Military career==
In November 1938, the young Lord Killanin was commissioned into the Queen&#x27;s Westminsters, a territorial regiment of the British Army, where he was responsible for recruiting fellow journalists, including future &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; editor Bill Deedes, and friends who were musicians and actors. He reached the rank of major and took part in the planning of D-Day and the Battle of Normandy in 1944, acting as brigade major for 30th Armoured Brigade, part of the 79th Armoured Division. He was appointed, due to the course of operations, a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). After being demobilised, he went to Ireland. He was awarded the Territorial Efficiency Medal in 1946, and the Efficiency Decoration in 1950. He resigned his TA commission in 1951.

==President of the IOC==
In 1950, Lord Killanin became the head of the Olympic Council of Ireland (the OCI), and became his country&#x27;s representative in the IOC in 1952. He became senior vice-president in 1968, and succeeded Avery Brundage, becoming President elect at the 73rd IOC Session (21–24 August) held in Munich prior to the 1972 Summer Olympics. He took office soon after the Games.

During his presidency, the Olympic movement experienced a difficult period, dealing with the financial flop of the 1976 Montreal Olympics and the international boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Denver, originally selected to host the 1976 Winter Olympics, withdrew and had to be replaced by Innsbruck. The cities of Lake Placid and Los Angeles were chosen for 1980 Winter and 1984 Summer Games by default due to a lack of competing bids. Killanin retired after the Moscow Olympics in 1980, and was succeeded by Juan Antonio Samaranch. He was later unanimously elected Honorary Life President.

==Other positions==
Killanin served as Honorary Consul-General of Monaco in Ireland from 1961 to 1984.

Killanin served as Chairman of the Race Committee for Galway Racecourse from 1970 to 1985. In his acceptance speech on behalf of the Galway Race Committee when accepting an award for its contribution to Irish Racing in 2013 the then chairman Tim Naughton said Lord Killanin&#x27;s appointment as Chairman of the Race Committee in the early 1970s was instrumental in setting in motion a train of development that has resulted in the venue not only becoming a top horse-racing destination but also an attractive tourist destination. A keen horse racing enthusiast, Killanin also served as a steward of the Irish Turf Club on two occasions and on the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.

In his business life Killanin was a director of many companies including Shell Ireland, Ulster Bank, Beamish and Crawford, and Chubb Ireland. He was a founder member of An Taisce (The National Trust for Ireland) and was chairman of the National Monuments Advisory Council until his death.

In 1948 Killanin was invested as a Knight of Honour and Devotion in the Irish Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.

==Film==
Lord Killanin also worked in the film industry, collaborating with his lifelong friend, John Ford, on &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;, when he acted as a general factotum, and later producing two of Ford&#x27;s films &quot;The Rising of the Moon&quot; and &quot;Gideon’s Day&quot;, as well as the film &quot; The Playboy of the Western World&quot;.

==Death==

Killanin died at his home in Dublin aged 84 and, following a bilingual funeral Mass at St Enda&#x27;s Church in Spiddal, County Galway, he was buried in the family vault in Bohermore Cemetery, Galway.

<doc id="202517" wikidata="Q1372349" url="?curid=202517" title="Johan Christopher Toll">
<text>Count Johan Christopher Toll (1 February 1743 – 21 May 1817) was a Swedish statesman and soldier.

==Early life==
He was born in Mölleröd, Scania (now part of Hässleholm Municipality, Skåne County). Toll came of from an old family of Dutch origin, which can be traced back to the 13th century. They migrated to the Baltic provinces in the 16th century.

Toll&#x27;s father was one of Charles XII&#x27;s soldiers, his mother being a descendant of the aristocratic Gyllenstjerna family. In his youth Johan Christopher served during the Seven Years&#x27; War, and then, exchanging the military for civil service, became head ranger of Kristianstad County.

== Royal conspirator ==
During the Riksdag of 1771–1772, the &quot;Cap&quot; faction, which were the dominant one at the time, deprived him of his position as ranger, and Toll, guessing that the king was preparing a revolution, almost forced his services on the conspirators. Georg Magnus Sprengtporten, one of the main instigators of the plot, declaring that someone uninitiated into the scheme who seemingly knew of their plans must either &quot;be killed or bribed&quot;. Toll was assigned by far one of the more difficult part of the enterprise - to secure the important southern fortress of Kristianstad. Two days after the coronation of Gustav III, on 21 May 1772, he set forth from Stockholm with twenty-two pounds of silver with which to bribe the garrison and have them revolt in the name of the king. He had no credentials, and the little that was known about him locally was not to his credit. In the fortress garrison itself there was but one man known to be a royalist, namely, Captain Abraham Hellichius. He reached Kristianstad on 21 June and managed to first win over Hellichius, and, six weeks later on 12 August, the rest of the garrison. Toll arrested the few officers who proved recalcitrant; taking possession of the records and military chest, and then closing the gates to the &quot;Cap&quot; high commissioner who had been warned by the English minister, John Gooderich, that something was afoot in the south. Seven days later Gustav III&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état in Stockholm completed the revolution.

== Political career ==
Toll was liberally rewarded and more and more frequently employed as his genius as an administrator and his blameless integrity came to light. His reforms in the commissariat department were epoch-making, and the superior mobility of the Swedish forces under Gustav III was due entirely to his initiative. But it was upon Toll&#x27;s boundless audacity that Gustav chiefly relied. Thus as Gustav, under the pressure of circumstances, inclined more and more towards absolutism, it was upon Toll that he principally leant. In 1783, Toll was placed at the head of the secret &quot;Commission of National Defence &quot; which ruled Sweden during the king&#x27;s absence abroad without the privity of the Council. It was he who persuaded the king to summon the Riksdag of 1786, which, however, he failed to control, and in all Gustav&#x27;s plans for forcing on a war with Russia Toll was initiated from the first. In 1786 he had already risen to the rank of major-general and was Gustav&#x27;s principal adjutant. It was against Toll&#x27;s advice, however, that Gustav, in 1788, began the war with Russia. Toll had always insisted that, in such a contingency, Sweden should be militarily as well as diplomatically prepared, but this was far from being the case. Nevertheless, when the inevitable first disasters happened, Toll was, most unjustly, made a scapegoat, but the later successes of the war were largely due to his care and diligence as commissary-general. After the death of Gustav III Toll was for a short time war minister and commander-in-chief in Scania and, subsequently, was sent as ambassador to Warsaw. Unjustly involved in the so-called &quot;Armfelt conspiracy&quot; he was condemned to two years imprisonment; but was fully reinstated when in 1796 Gustav IV attained his majority. At the Riksdag at Norrköping in 1800, he was elected marshal of the Diet (Lantmarskalk), and led the royalist party with consummate ability. On this occasion he forced the mutinous nobility or riddarhuset to accept the detested Act of Union and Security by threatening to reveal the names of all the persons suspected of complicity in the murder of the late king. Subsequently he displayed great diplomatic adroitness in his negotiations with the powers concerning Sweden&#x27;s participation in the war against Napoleon.

== Military commander ==
In the Franco-Swedish War, Toll assisted in the defence of Stralsund. The fortress was compelled to surrender on 20 August by Marshal Brune, whereupon the Swedish army of 13,000 men, which had retired to Rügen, seemed irretrievably lost. It was saved by Toll, who cajoled the French marshal into a convention whereby the Swedish army, with all its munitions of war, was permitted to return unmolested to Sweden on 7 September 1807. For this exploit Toll received his marshal&#x27;s baton. It was in the camp of Toll, then acting commander-in-chief in Scania, that Gustavus IV was about to take refuge when the western army rebelled against him, but he was arrested in the capital before he could do so. Toll retained his high position under Bernadotte, who, in 1814, created him a count. He died unmarried.

<text>The Odenwaldkreis is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the south of Hesse, Germany. Neighboring districts are Darmstadt-Dieburg, Miltenberg, Neckar-Odenwald-Kreis, Rhein-Neckar-Kreis and Kreis Bergstraße. &quot;Odenwaldkreis&quot; belongs to the Rhine Neckar Area.

==History==
In 1822 the district was created under the name &quot;Erbach&quot;, subdivided into two &quot;Bezirke&quot; Breuberg and Erbach. The last of several modifications of the district was in 1972, when some municipalities from the Dieburg and Bergstraße district were added to the district. In 1972 the district also changed its name.

Dietrich Kühler, in March 2015 Frank Matiaske (SPD) was voted as the successor of Dietrich Kühler and would be the chief from August 2015.

==Geography==
As the name of the district already suggests it is located in the Odenwald mountains.

==Coat of arms==
The oak tree of the coat of arms symbolize the forests of the district, which also gave the district its name (&quot;Wald&quot; = forest). The three stars were taken from the coat of arms of the Counts of Erbach, who once ruled the area.

<doc id="202522" wikidata="Q186161" url="?curid=202522" title="Ionizing radiation">
<text>Ionizing (ionising) radiation, including nuclear radiation, consists of subatomic particles or electromagnetic waves that have enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules by detaching electrons from them. Some particles can travel up to 99% of the speed of light, and the electromagnetic waves are on the high-energy portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Gamma rays, X-rays, and the higher energy ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum are ionizing radiation; whereas the lower energy ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves are non-ionizing radiation. Nearly all types of laser light are non-ionizing radiation. The boundary between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation in the ultraviolet area cannot be sharply defined, as different molecules and atoms ionize at different energies. The energy of ionizing radiation starts between 10 electronvolts (eV) and 33 eV.

Ionizing subatomic particles include alpha particles, beta particles, and neutrons. These particles are created by radioactive decay, and almost all are energetic enough to ionize. There are also secondary cosmic particles produced after cosmic rays interact with Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, including muons, mesons, and positrons. Cosmic rays may also produce radioisotopes on Earth (for example, carbon-14), which in turn decay and emit ionizing radiation. Cosmic rays and the decay of radioactive isotopes are the primary sources of natural ionizing radiation on Earth, contributing to background radiation. Ionizing radiation is also generated artificially by X-ray tubes, particle accelerators, and nuclear fission.

Ionizing radiation is not immediately detectable by human senses, so instruments such as Geiger counters are used to detect and measure it. However, very high energy particles can produce visible effects on both organic and inorganic matter (e.g. water lighting in Cherenkov radiation) or humans (e.g. acute radiation syndrome).

Ionizing radiation is used in a wide variety of fields such as medicine, nuclear power, research, and industrial manufacturing, but is a health hazard if proper measures against excessive exposure are not taken. Exposure to ionizing radiation causes cell damage to living tissue and organ damage. In high acute doses, it will result in radiation burns and radiation sickness, and lower level doses over a protracted time can cause cancer. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) issues guidance on ionizing radiation protection, and the effects of dose uptake on human health.

==Directly ionizing radiation==

Ionizing radiation may be grouped as directly or indirectly ionizing.

Any charged particle with mass can ionize atoms directly by fundamental interaction through the Coulomb force if it has enough kinetic energy. Such particles include atomic nuclei, electrons, muons, charged pions, protons, and energetic charged nuclei stripped of their electrons. When moving at relativistic speeds (near the speed of light, c) these particles have enough kinetic energy to be ionizing, but there is considerable speed variation. For example, a typical alpha particle moves at about 5% of c, but an electron with 33 eV (just enough to ionize) moves at about 1% of c.

Two of the first types of directly ionizing radiation to be discovered are alpha particles which are helium nuclei ejected from the nucleus of an atom during radioactive decay, and energetic electrons, which are called beta particles.

Natural cosmic rays are made up primarily of relativistic protons but also include heavier atomic nuclei like helium ions and HZE ions. In the atmosphere such particles are often stopped by air molecules, and this produces short-lived charged pions, which soon decay to muons, a primary type of cosmic ray radiation that reaches the surface of the earth. Pions can also be produced in large amounts in particle accelerators.

===Alpha particles===

Alpha (α) particles consist of two protons and two neutrons bound together into a particle: a helium-4 nucleus. Alpha particle emissions are generally produced in the process of alpha decay.

Alpha particles are a strongly ionizing form of radiation, but when emitted by radioactive decay they have low penetration power and can be absorbed by a few centimeters of air, or by the top layer of human skin. More powerful alpha particles from ternary fission are three times as energetic, and penetrate proportionately farther in air. The helium nuclei that form 10–12% of cosmic rays, are also usually of much higher energy than those from radioactive decay and pose shielding problems in space. However, this type of radiation is significantly absorbed by Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, which is a radiation shield equivalent to about 10 meters of water.

The alpha particle was named by Ernest Rutherford after the first letter in the Greek alphabet, α, when he ranked the known radioactive emissions in descending order of ionizing effect in 1899. The symbol is α or α. Because they are identical to helium nuclei, they are also called He or indicating helium with a +2 charge (missing its two electrons). If the ion gains electrons from its environment, the α particle can be written as a normal (electrically neutral) helium atom .

===Beta particles===

Beta (β) particles are high-energy, high-speed electrons or positrons emitted by certain types of radioactive nuclei, such as potassium-40. The production of β particles is termed beta decay. There are two forms of β decay, β and β, which respectively give rise to the electron and the positron. Beta particles are much less penetrating than gamma radiation, but more penetrating than alpha particles.

High-energy beta particles may produce X-rays known as bremsstrahlung (&quot;braking radiation&quot;) or secondary electrons (delta ray) as they pass through matter. Both of these can cause an indirect ionization effect. Bremsstrahlung is of concern when shielding beta emitters, as the interaction of beta particles with some shielding materials produces bremsstrahlung. The effect is greater with material having high atomic numbers, so material with low atomic numbers is used for beta source shielding.

===Positrons and other types of antimatter===

The positron or antielectron is the antiparticle or the antimatter counterpart of the electron. When a low-energy positron collides with a low-energy electron, annihilation occurs, resulting in their conversion into the energy of two or more gamma ray photons (see electron–positron annihilation). As positrons are positively charged particles they can directly ionize an atom through Coulomb interactions.

Positrons can be generated by positron emission nuclear decay (through weak interactions), or by pair production from a sufficiently energetic photon. Positrons are common artificial sources of ionizing radiation used in medical positron emission tomography (PET) scans.

===Charged nuclei===
Charged nuclei are characteristic of galactic cosmic rays and solar particle events and except for alpha particles (charged helium nuclei) have no natural sources on earth. In space, however, very high energy protons, helium nuclei, and HZE ions can be initially stopped by relatively thin layers of shielding, clothes, or skin. However, the resulting interaction will generate secondary radiation and cause cascading biological effects. If just one atom of tissue is displaced by an energetic proton, for example, the collision will cause further interactions in the body. This is called &quot;linear energy transfer&quot; (LET), which utilizes elastic scattering.

LET can be visualized as a billiard ball hitting another in the manner of the conservation of momentum, sending both away with the energy of the first ball divided between the two unequally. When a charged nucleus strikes a relatively slow-moving nucleus of an object in space, LET occurs and neutrons, alpha particles, low-energy protons, and other nuclei will be released by the collisions and contribute to the total absorbed dose of tissue.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA/TP-1999-209320&quot;&gt; Kim, Myung-Hee Y.; Wilson, John W.; Cucinotta, Francis A.; Simonsen, Lisa C.; Atwell, William; Badavi, Francis F.; Miller, Jack, NASA Johnson Space Center; Langley Research Center, May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indirectly ionizing radiation==
Indirectly ionizing radiation is electrically neutral and does not interact strongly with matter, therefore the bulk of the ionization effects are due to secondary ionization.

===Photon radiation===


Even though photons are electrically neutral, they can ionize atoms indirectly through the photoelectric effect and the Compton effect. Either of those interactions cause the ejection of an electron from an atom at relativistic speeds, turning that electron into a (secondary) beta particle that will ionize other atoms. Since most of the ionized atoms are due to the secondary beta particles, photons are indirectly ionizing radiation.

Radiated photons are called gamma rays if they are produced by a nuclear reaction, subatomic particle decay, or radioactive decay within the nucleus. They are called x-rays if produced outside the nucleus. The generic term &quot;photon&quot; is used to describe both.

X-rays normally have a lower energy than gamma rays, and an older convention was to define the boundary as a wavelength of 10−11 m (or a photon energy of 100 keV). That threshold was driven by historic limitations of older X-ray tubes and low awareness of isomeric transitions. Modern technologies and discoveries have shown an overlap between X-ray and gamma energies. In many fields they are functionally identical, differing for terrestrial studies only in origin of the radiation. In astronomy, however, where radiation origin often cannot be reliably determined, the old energy division has been preserved, with X-rays defined as being between about 120 eV and 120 keV, and gamma rays as being of any energy above 100 to 120 keV, regardless of source. Most astronomical &quot;gamma-rays&quot; are known &quot;not&quot; to originate from radioactivity but, rather, result from processes like those that produce astronomical X-rays, except driven by much more energetic electrons.

Photoelectric absorption is the dominant mechanism in organic materials for photon energies below 100 keV, typical of classical X-ray tube originated X-rays. At energies beyond 100 keV, photons ionize matter increasingly through the Compton effect, and then indirectly through pair production at energies beyond 5 MeV. The accompanying interaction diagram shows two Compton scatterings happening sequentially. In every scattering event, the gamma ray transfers energy to an electron, and it continues on its path in a different direction and with reduced energy.

===Definition boundary for lower-energy photons===

The lowest ionization energy of any element is 3.89 eV, for caesium. However, US Federal Communications Commission material defines ionizing radiation as that with a photon energy greater than 10 eV (equivalent to a far ultraviolet wavelength of 124 nanometers). Roughly, this corresponds to both the first ionization energy of oxygen, and the ionization energy of hydrogen, both about 14 eV. In some Environmental Protection Agency references, the ionization of a typical water molecule at an energy of 33 eV is referenced as the appropriate biological threshold for ionizing radiation: this value represents the so-called &quot;W-value&quot;, the colloquial name for the ICRU&#x27;s mean energy expended in a gas per ion pair formed, which combines ionization energy plus the energy lost to other processes such as excitation. At 38 nanometers wavelength for electromagnetic radiation, 33 eV is close to the energy at the conventional 10 nm wavelength transition between extreme ultraviolet and X-ray radiation, which occurs at about 125 eV. Thus, X-ray radiation is always ionizing, but only extreme-ultraviolet radiation can be considered ionizing under all definitions.

===Neutrons===
Neutrons have a neutral electrical charge often misunderstood as zero electrical charge and thus often do not &quot;directly&quot; cause ionization in a single step or interaction with matter. However, fast neutrons will interact with the protons in hydrogen via linear energy transfer, energy that a particle transfers to the material it is moving through. This mechanism scatters the nuclei of the materials in the target area, causing direct ionization of the hydrogen atoms. When neutrons strike the hydrogen nuclei, proton radiation (fast protons) results. These protons are themselves ionizing because they are of high energy, are charged, and interact with electrons.

Neutrons that strike other nuclei besides hydrogen, transfer less energy to the other particle if linear energy transfer does occur. But, for many nuclei struck by neutrons, inelastic scattering occurs. Whether elastic or inelastic scatter occurs is dependent on the speed of the neutron, whether fast or thermal or somewhere in between. It is also dependent on the nuclei it strikes and its neutron cross section.

In inelastic scattering, neutrons are readily absorbed in a type of nuclear reaction called neutron capture and attributes to the neutron activation of the nucleus. Neutron interactions with most types of matter in this manner usually produce radioactive nuclei. Oxygen-16, for example, undergoes neutron activation, rapidly decays by a proton emission forming nitrogen-16, which decays to oxygen-16. The short-lived nitrogen-16 decay emits a powerful beta ray. This process can be written as:

O (n,p) N (fast neutron capture possible with &gt;11 MeV neutron)
N → O + β (Decay t = 7.13 s)
This high-energy β further interacts rapidly with other nuclei, emitting high-energy γ via Bremsstrahlung

While not a favorable reaction, the O (n,p) N reaction is a major source of X-rays emitted from the cooling water of a pressurized water reactor and contributes enormously to the radiation generated by a water-cooled nuclear reactor while operating.

For the best shielding of neutrons, hydrocarbons that have an abundance of hydrogen are used.

In fissile materials, secondary neutrons may produce nuclear chain reactions, causing a larger amount of ionization from the daughter products of fission.

Outside the nucleus, free neutrons are unstable and have a mean lifetime of 14 minutes, 42 seconds. Free neutrons decay by emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino to become a proton, a process known as beta decay:

In the adjacent diagram, a neutron collides with a proton of the target material, and then becomes a fast recoil proton that ionizes in turn. At the end of its path, the neutron is captured by a nucleus in an (n,γ)-reaction that leads to the emission of a neutron capture photon. Such photons always have enough energy to qualify as ionizing radiation.

==Physical effects==

===Nuclear effects===
Neutron radiation, alpha radiation, and extremely energetic gamma (&gt; ~20 MeV) can cause nuclear transmutation and induced radioactivity. The relevant mechanisms are neutron activation, alpha absorption, and photodisintegration. A large enough number of transmutations can change macroscopic properties and cause targets to become radioactive themselves, even after the original source is removed.

===Chemical effects===

Ionization of molecules can lead to radiolysis (breaking chemical bonds), and formation of highly reactive free radicals. These free radicals may then react chemically with neighbouring materials even after the original radiation has stopped (e.g. ozone cracking of polymers by ozone formed by ionization of air). Ionizing radiation can also accelerate existing chemical reactions such as polymerization and corrosion, by contributing to the activation energy required for the reaction. Optical materials deteriorate under the effect of ionizing radiation.

High-intensity ionizing radiation in air can produce a visible ionized air glow of telltale bluish-purple color. The glow can be observed, e.g., during criticality accidents, around mushroom clouds shortly after a nuclear explosion, or the inside of a damaged nuclear reactor like during the Chernobyl disaster.

Monatomic fluids, e.g. molten sodium, have no chemical bonds to break and no crystal lattice to disturb, so they are immune to the chemical effects of ionizing radiation. Simple diatomic compounds with very negative enthalpy of formation, such as hydrogen fluoride will reform rapidly and spontaneously after ionization.

===Electrical effects===
The ionization of materials temporarily increases their conductivity, potentially permitting damaging current levels. This is a particular hazard in semiconductor microelectronics used in electronic equipment; subsequent currents introduce operation errors or even permanently damage the devices. Devices intended for high-radiation environments such as the nuclear industry or outer space, may be made &quot;radiation hard&quot; to resist such effects through design, material selection, and fabrication methods.

Proton radiation found in space can also cause single-event upsets in digital circuits. The electrical effects of ionizing radiation are exploited in gas-filled radiation detectors, e.g. the Geiger counter or the ion chamber.

==Health effects==
Most adverse health effects of exposure to ionizing radiation may be grouped in two general categories:
* deterministic effects (harmful tissue reactions) due in large part to killing or malfunction of cells following high doses from radiation burns.
* stochastic effects, i.e., cancer and heritable effects involving either cancer development in exposed individuals owing to mutation of somatic cells or heritable disease in their offspring owing to mutation of reproductive (germ) cells.

The most common impact is stochastic radiation-induced cancer with a latent period of years or decades after exposure. For example, ionizing radiation is one cause of chronic myelogenous leukemia, although most people with CML have not been exposed to radiation. The mechanism by which this occurs is well understood, but quantitative models predicting the level of risk remain controversial.

The most widely accepted model, the Linear no-threshold model (LNT), holds that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation increases linearly with effective radiation dose at a rate of 5.5% per sievert. If this is correct, then natural background radiation is the most hazardous source of radiation to general public health, followed by medical imaging as a close second. Other stochastic effects of ionizing radiation are teratogenesis, cognitive decline, and heart disease.

Though DNA is always susceptible to damage by ionizing radiation, the DNA molecule may also be damaged by radiation with enough energy to excite certain molecular bonds to form pyrimidine dimers. This energy may be less than ionizing, but near to it. A good example is ultraviolet spectrum energy which begins at about 3.1 eV (400 nm) at close to the same energy level which can cause sunburn to unprotected skin, as a result of photoreactions in collagen and (in the UV-B range) also damage in DNA (for example, pyrimidine dimers). Thus, the mid and lower ultraviolet electromagnetic spectrum is damaging to biological tissues as a result of electronic excitation in molecules which falls short of ionization, but produces similar non-thermal effects. To some extent, visible light and also ultraviolet A (UVA) which is closest to visible energies, have been proven to result in formation of reactive oxygen species in skin, which cause indirect damage since these are electronically excited molecules which can inflict reactive damage, although they do not cause sunburn (erythema). Like ionization-damage, all these effects in skin are beyond those produced by simple thermal effects.

==Measurement of radiation==

The table below shows radiation and dose quantities in SI and non-SI units.

==Uses of radiation==

Ionizing radiation has many industrial, military, and medical uses. Its usefulness must be balanced with its hazards, a compromise that has shifted over time. For example, at one time, assistants in shoe shops in the US used X-rays to check a child&#x27;s shoe size, but this practice was halted when the risks of ionizing radiation were better understood.

Neutron radiation is essential to the working of nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. The penetrating power of x-ray, gamma, beta, and positron radiation is used for medical imaging, nondestructive testing, and a variety of industrial gauges. Radioactive tracers are used in medical and industrial applications, as well as biological and radiation chemistry. Alpha radiation is used in static eliminators and smoke detectors. The sterilizing effects of ionizing radiation are useful for cleaning medical instruments, food irradiation, and the sterile insect technique. Measurements of carbon-14, is used for radiocarbon dating.

==Sources of radiation==
Ionizing radiation is generated through nuclear reactions, nuclear decay, by very high temperature, or via acceleration of charged particles in electromagnetic fields. Natural sources include the Sun, lightning and supernova explosions. Artificial sources include nuclear reactors, particle accelerators, and x-ray tubes.

The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) itemized types of human exposures.

The International Commission on Radiological Protection manages the International System of Radiological Protection, which sets recommended limits for dose uptake.

===Background radiation===

Background radiation comes from both natural and human-made sources.

The global average exposure of humans to ionizing radiation is about 3 mSv (0.3 rem) per year, 80% of which comes from nature. The remaining 20% results from exposure to human-made radiation sources, mainly medical imaging. Average human-made exposure is much higher in developed countries, mostly due to CT scans and nuclear medicine.

Natural background radiation comes from five primary sources: cosmic radiation, solar radiation, external terrestrial sources, radiation in the human body, and radon.

The background rate for natural radiation varies considerably with location, being as low as 1.5 mSv/a (1.5 mSv per year) in some areas and over 100 mSv/a in others. The highest level of purely natural radiation recorded on the Earth&#x27;s surface is 90 μGy/h (0.8 Gy/a) on a Brazilian black beach composed of monazite. The highest background radiation in an inhabited area is found in Ramsar, mainly due to naturally radioactive limestone used as a building material. Some 2000 of the most exposed residents receive an average radiation dose of 10 mGy per year, (1 rad/yr) ten times more than the ICRP recommended limit for exposure to the public from artificial sources. Record levels were found in a house where the effective radiation dose due to external radiation was 135 mSv/a, (13.5 rem/yr) and the committed dose from radon was 640 mSv/a (64.0 rem/yr). This unique case is over 200 times higher than the world average background radiation. Despite the high levels of background radiation that the residents of Ramsar receive there is no compelling evidence that they experience a greater health risk. The ICRP recommendations are conservative limits and may represent an over representation of the actual health risk. Generally radiation safety organization recommend the most conservative limits assuming it is best to err on the side of caution. This level of caution is appropriate but should not be used to create fear about background radiation danger. Radiation danger from background radiation may be a serious threat but is more likely a small overall risk compared to all other factors in the environment.

====Cosmic radiation====

The Earth, and all living things on it, are constantly bombarded by radiation from outside our solar system. This cosmic radiation consists of relativistic particles: positively charged nuclei (ions) from 1 amu protons (about 85% of it) to ~56 amu iron nuclei and even beyond. (The high-atomic number particles are called HZE ions.) The energy of this radiation can far exceed that which humans can create, even in the largest particle accelerators (see ultra-high-energy cosmic ray). This radiation interacts in the atmosphere to create secondary radiation that rains down, including x-rays, muons, protons, antiprotons, alpha particles, pions, electrons, positrons, and neutrons.

The dose from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, with a dose rate that varies in different parts of the world and based largely on the geomagnetic field, altitude, and solar cycle. The cosmic-radiation dose rate on airplanes is so high that, according to the United Nations UNSCEAR 2000 Report (see links at bottom), airline flight crew workers receive more dose on average than any other worker, including those in nuclear power plants. Airline crews receive more cosmic rays if they routinely work flight routes that take them close to the North or South pole at high altitudes, where this type of radiation is maximal.

Cosmic rays also include high-energy gamma rays, which are far beyond the energies produced by solar or human sources.

====External terrestrial sources====
Most materials on Earth contain some radioactive atoms, even if in small quantities. Most of the dose received from these sources is from gamma-ray emitters in building materials, or rocks and soil when outside. The major radionuclides of concern for terrestrial radiation are isotopes of potassium, uranium, and thorium. Each of these sources has been decreasing in activity since the formation of the Earth.

====Internal radiation sources====

All earthly materials that are the building blocks of life contain a radioactive component. As organisms consume food, air, and water, an inventory of radioisotopes builds up within the organism (see banana equivalent dose). Some radionuclides, like potassium-40, emit a high-energy gamma ray that can be measured by sensitive electronic radiation measurement systems. These internal radiation sources contribute to an individual&#x27;s total radiation dose from natural background radiation.

====Radon====

An important source of natural radiation is radon gas, which seeps continuously from bedrock but can, because of its high density, accumulate in poorly ventilated houses.

Radon-222 is a gas produced by the α-decay of radium-226. Both are a part of the natural uranium decay chain. Uranium is found in soil throughout the world in varying concentrations. Radon is the largest cause of lung cancer among non-smokers and the second-leading cause overall.

==Radiation exposure==


There are three standard ways to limit exposure:
# Time: For people exposed to radiation in addition to natural background radiation, limiting or minimizing the exposure time will reduce the dose from the source of radiation.
# Distance: Radiation intensity decreases sharply with distance, according to an inverse-square law (in an absolute vacuum).
# Shielding: Air or skin can be sufficient to substantially attenuate alpha radiation, while sheet metal or plastic is often sufficient to stop beta radiation. Barriers of lead, concrete, or water are often used to give effective protection from more penetrating forms of ionizing radiation such as gamma rays and neutrons. Some radioactive materials are stored or handled underwater or by remote control in rooms constructed of thick concrete or lined with lead. There are special plastic shields that stop beta particles, and air will stop most alpha particles. The effectiveness of a material in shielding radiation is determined by its half-value thicknesses, the thickness of material that reduces the radiation by half. This value is a function of the material itself and of the type and energy of ionizing radiation. Some generally accepted thicknesses of attenuating material are 5 mm of aluminum for most beta particles, and 3 inches of lead for gamma radiation.

These can all be applied to natural and human-made sources. For human-made sources the use of Containment is a major tool in reducing dose uptake and is effectively a combination of shielding and isolation from the open environment. Radioactive materials are confined in the smallest possible space and kept out of the environment such as in a hot cell (for radiation) or glove box (for contamination). Radioactive isotopes for medical use, for example, are dispensed in closed handling facilities, usually gloveboxes, while nuclear reactors operate within closed systems with multiple barriers that keep the radioactive materials contained. Work rooms, hot cells and gloveboxes have slightly reduced air pressures to prevent escape of airborne material to the open environment.

In nuclear conflicts or civil nuclear releases civil defense measures can help reduce exposure of populations by reducing ingestion of isotopes and occupational exposure. One is the issue of potassium iodide (KI) tablets, which blocks the uptake of radioactive iodine (one of the major radioisotope products of nuclear fission) into the human thyroid gland.

===Occupational exposure===
Occupationally exposed individuals are controlled within the regulatory framework of the country they work in, and in accordance with any local nuclear licence constraints. These are usually based on the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection.
The ICRP recommends limiting artificial irradiation. For occupational exposure, the limit is 50 mSv in a single year with a maximum of 100 mSv in a consecutive five-year period.

The radiation exposure of these individuals is carefully monitored with the use of dosimeters and other radiological protection instruments which will measure radioactive particulate concentrations, area gamma dose readings and radioactive contamination. A legal record of dose is kept.

Examples of activities where occupational exposure is a concern include:
* Airline crew (the most exposed population)
* Industrial radiography
* Medical radiology and nuclear medicine
* Uranium mining
* Nuclear power plant and nuclear fuel reprocessing plant workers
* Research laboratories (government, university and private)

Some human-made radiation sources affect the body through direct radiation, known as effective dose (radiation) while others take the form of radioactive contamination and irradiate the body from within. The latter is known as committed dose.

===Public exposure===
Medical procedures, such as diagnostic X-rays, nuclear medicine, and radiation therapy are by far the most significant source of human-made radiation exposure to the general public. Some of the major radionuclides used are I-131, Tc-99m, Co-60, Ir-192, and Cs-137. The public is also exposed to radiation from consumer products, such as tobacco (polonium-210), combustible fuels (gas, coal, etc.), televisions, luminous watches and dials (tritium), airport X-ray systems, smoke detectors (americium), electron tubes, and gas lantern mantles (thorium).

Of lesser magnitude, members of the public are exposed to radiation from the nuclear fuel cycle, which includes the entire sequence from processing uranium to the disposal of the spent fuel. The effects of such exposure have not been reliably measured due to the extremely low doses involved. Opponents use a cancer per dose model to assert that such activities cause several hundred cases of cancer per year, an application of the widely accepted Linear no-threshold model (LNT).

The International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends limiting artificial irradiation to the public to an average of 1 mSv (0.001 Sv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures.

In a nuclear war, gamma rays from both the initial weapon explosion and fallout would be sources of radiation exposure.

====Spaceflight====
Massive particles are a concern for astronauts outside the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field who would receive solar particles from solar proton events (SPE) and galactic cosmic rays from cosmic sources. These high-energy charged nuclei are blocked by Earth&#x27;s magnetic field but pose a major health concern for astronauts traveling to the Moon and to any distant location beyond Earth orbit. Highly charged HZE ions in particular are known to be extremely damaging, though protons make up the vast majority of galactic cosmic rays. Evidence indicates past SPE radiation levels that would have been lethal for unprotected astronauts.

====Air travel====
Air travel exposes people on aircraft to increased radiation from space as compared to sea level, including cosmic rays and from solar flare events. Software programs such as Epcard, CARI, SIEVERT, PCAIRE are attempts to simulate exposure by aircrews and passengers. An example of a measured dose (not simulated dose) is 6 μSv per hour from London Heathrow to Tokyo Narita on a polar route. However, dosages can vary, such as during periods of high solar activity. The United States FAA requires airlines to provide flight crew with information about cosmic radiation, and an International Commission on Radiological Protection recommendation for the general public is no more than 1 mSv per year. Also, many airlines do not allow pregnant flightcrew members, to comply with a European Directive. The FAA has a recommended limit of 1 mSv total for a pregnancy, and no more than 0.5 mSv per month. Information originally based on &quot;Fundamentals of Aerospace Medicine&quot; published in 2008.

===Radiation hazard warning signs===
Hazardous levels of ionizing radiation are signified by the trefoil sign on a yellow background. These are usually posted at the boundary of a radiation controlled area or in any place where radiation levels are significantly above background due to human intervention.

The red ionizing radiation warning symbol (ISO 21482) was launched in 2007, and is intended for IAEA Category 1, 2 and 3 sources defined as dangerous sources capable of death or serious injury, including food irradiators, teletherapy machines for cancer treatment and industrial radiography units. The symbol is to be placed on the device housing the source, as a warning not to dismantle the device or to get any closer. It will not be visible under normal use, only if someone attempts to disassemble the device. The symbol will not be located on building access doors, transportation packages or containers.

<text>Timothy James Kazurinsky (born March 3, 1950) is an American actor, comedian and screenwriter best known as a cast member and writer on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and for his role as Carl Sweetchuck in the &quot;Police Academy&quot; films.

==Early life==
Kazurinsky was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. His father, who was American-born, was of Polish descent, and his mother was an Australian war bride. He spent most of his childhood in Australia, where he attended Birrong Boys High School. When he was 16, he moved to America by himself. He completed his education, graduating from Greater Johnstown High School in 1967.

Kazurinsky worked as a reporter for the &quot;Johnstown Tribune-Democrat&quot;, then as a copywriter for a St. Louis, Missouri, department store. He moved to Chicago and began working for Leo Burnett Worldwide in its advertising department. Seeking to gain confidence presenting ad pitches, Kazurinsky enrolled in an improv class at The Second City, where he became a member of the mainstage troupe in 1978, refining his improvisation and acting chops under the tutelage of Del Close. Eventually, Kazurinsky caught the attention of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; luminary John Belushi who recommended him to the show&#x27;s then-executive producer, Dick Ebersol. Ebersol was impressed with Kazurinsky and hired him as a writer and cast member in 1981.

==&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;==
During his three seasons on &quot;SNL&quot;, Kazurinsky was known for playing numerous characters as well as doing celebrity impersonations. Fellow cast members included Eddie Murphy, Joe Piscopo, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Mary Gross. Kazurinsky was part of the show&#x27;s 1984 writing team nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program. There were reports that he often clashed with Dick Ebersol regarding the show&#x27;s creative direction. In 1984, Kazurinsky left &quot;SNL&quot; along with Piscopo.

===Recurring characters on &quot;SNL&quot;===
* Dr. Jack Badofsky, supposed science editor of &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, who presented absurd lists of humorous pun-based disease names. Jon Stewart referenced the character in a 2011 &quot;Daily Show&quot; segment lampooning Herman Cain. The character was again alluded to in a 2016 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; when Mr. Burns exclaims, &quot;Wordplay is for crosswords and Kazurinskys!&quot;
* Mr. Landlord from &quot;Mr. Robinson&#x27;s Neighborhood&quot; with Eddie Murphy
* Father Timothy Owens, an Irish priest
* The Iguana, the male half of a hopelessly dorky couple who never revealed to his wife that he was a dangerous adventurer
* Havnagootiim Vishnuuerheer (pronounced &quot;Having a good time wish you were here&quot;), a Hindu &quot;Enlightened Master&quot; who cleared up &quot;The Great Unanswered Questions of the Universe&quot;
* Wayne Huevos, a suave Latin-American businessman who appeared on &quot;Weekend Update&quot; with ideas on how to clean up New York City
* Worthington Clotman, &quot;SNL&#x27;s&quot; resident network censor, based on real-life network censor Bill Clotworthy, who would interrupt sketches and point out objectionable material
* Madge The Chimp&#x27;s Husband in the recurring soap opera drama &quot;I Married a Monkey&quot;

==Other work==
Kazurinsky had a small part as a photographer in the 1980 Christopher Reeve/Jane Seymour film &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;. At the insistence of his friend John Belushi, he played Pa Greavy in the 1981 Belushi/Aykroyd comedy &quot;Neighbors&quot;. Shortly after departing &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Kazurinsky co-wrote &quot;About Last Night...&quot; based on David Mamet&#x27;s one act play, &quot;Sexual Perversity in Chicago&quot;. The film starred Rob Lowe, Demi Moore and Jim Belushi and was directed by Edward Zwick. A remake of &quot;About Last Night&quot; was released in 2014 starring comedian Kevin Hart. Kazurinsky famously portrayed Officer Carl Sweetchuck in &quot;Police Academy 2&quot;, &quot;3&quot; and &quot;4&quot;, whose character frequently runs into gang leader (later turned officer) Zed McGlunk, played by Bobcat Goldthwaite.

In the 1990s, Kazurinsky guest starred in &quot;Married... with Children&quot;,&quot; Early Edition&quot; and &quot;Police Academy: The Series&quot;. In the 2000s, Kazurinsky wrote for and guest starred in comedy series such as &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;What About Joan?&quot;, &quot;Still Standing&quot; and &quot;According to Jim&quot;. In 2001, he wrote the screenplay for &quot;Strange Relations,&quot; a film starring Paul Reiser, George Wendt, Julie Walters, and Olympia Dukakis. The screenplay was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award as well as a BAFTA. Kazurinsky played a supporting role in the 2011 Zombie Army Productions film, &quot;The Moleman of Belmont Avenue&quot;, which also featured Robert Englund.

As a stage actor, Kazurinsky appeared as Felix in &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; (opposite George Wendt&#x27;s Oscar), Wilbur Turnblad in &quot;Hairspray&quot;, and Peter Quince in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Kazurinsky&#x27;s work in Chicago theatre has been recognized by two Joseph Jefferson Award nominations. In February 2014, Kazurinsky joined the first National Tour of the hit musical &quot;Wicked&quot; in the role of The Wizard, replacing John Davidson. Kazurinsky finished his run on in March 2015 when the First National Tour closed. In May 2015, Kazurinsky made his Broadway debut alongside Jim Parsons and Christopher Fitzgerald in a limited run of David Javerbaum&#x27;s new comedy, &quot;An Act Of God&quot;, directed by Joe Mantello between May and August 2015 at Studio 54.

Kazurinsky and George Wendt reunited for the September 2015 world premiere of Bruce Graham&#x27;s comedy &quot;Funnyman&quot; at Chicago&#x27;s Northlight Theatre. The production was directed by BJ Jones. In December 2016, Kazurinsky appeared as Frosch the jailer in Music Theatre Works&#x27; production of Johann Strauss II&#x27; operetta &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;.

Kazurinsky was one of a few people to film Prince&#x27;s now-legendary impromptu performance of &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot; at the SNL40 after party in February 2015. The video went viral following Prince&#x27;s death in 2016 and was shared by numerous media outlets.

In 2017, Kazurinsky played the recurring role of Judge Emerson on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Chicago Justice&quot;, and appeared as Father Timothy in Netflix&#x27;s original series, &quot;Easy&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kazurinsky lives outside Chicago with his wife, Broadway actress Marcia Watkins (&quot;On Your Toes&quot;, &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;). Kazurinsky has a daughter, Zoe, and a son, Pete.

<doc id="202526" wikidata="Q1331134" url="?curid=202526" title="Elizabeth Hawkins-Whitshed">
<text>Elizabeth Hawkins-Whitshed (26 June 1860 – 27 July 1934), usually known after her third marriage as Mrs Aubrey Le Blond and to her climbing friends as Lizzie Le Blond, was an Irish pioneer of mountaineering at a time when it was almost unheard of for a woman to climb mountains. She was also an author and a photographer of mountain scenery.

She came from an upper-class background, being the daughter of Captain Sir St Vincent Hawkins-Whitshed, 3rd Baronet (1837–1871) (see Hawkins-Whitshed baronets) by his wife Anne Alicia (&quot;née&quot; Handcock) (1837–1908), and further back was descended from the aristocratic Bentinck family, and was therefore related to the Dukes of Portland.

She grew up in Greystones, County Wicklow, in the south-east of Ireland, where her father owned quite a bit of land. However, her father then died, leaving no other children, while she was still a minor, and the Lord Chancellor took her on as his ward.

Elizabeth moved to Switzerland, where she climbed mountains and has since become well known for photos showing her climbing in a skirt. In 1907, she took the lead in forming the Ladies&#x27; Alpine Club and became its first president. She wrote seven books on mountain climbing and over her lifetime made twenty first ascents, reaching the summits of peaks not previously climbed.

As Mrs Aubrey Le Blond she made at least ten films of alpine activities in the Engadine Valley in Switzerland, including ice hockey at St Moritz and tobogganing on the Cresta Run. She is probably among the world&#x27;s first three female film-makers, after Alice Guy and contemporary with Laura Bayley. Her films were shown by James Williamson at Hove Town Hall in November 1900, being included in his catalogue in 1902, and were praised by the film pioneer Cecil Hepworth and the writer E. F. Benson.

She married three times: first, in 1879, to Frederick Burnaby (1842–1885); second, in 1886, to John Frederick Main (died 1892); and finally, in 1900, to Francis Bernard Aubrey Le Blond. From her first marriage, she had a son Harry Burnaby, in 1880. Despite her second and third marriages, the lands at Greystones that she had inherited from her father (before marriage) were to be known as the Burnaby Estate. This part of Greystones (The Burnaby) was developed after 1900. It includes Burnaby Road, Somerby Road, as well as Whitshed, St Vincent&#x27;s Road, Portland Road and Hawkins Lane. She published accounts of her climbing under the names Mrs. Fred Burnaby, Mrs. Main, and Mrs. Aubrey Le Blond.

She published her autobiography &quot;Day In, Day Out&quot; in 1928.

== Personal life ==
Elizabeth Hawkins-Whitshed was born in Dublin on 26 June 1860. She was the daughter of Captain Vincent Hawkins-Whitshed and Mrs. Anne Hawkins-Whitshed who raised her in Killincarrick House, Greystones, County Wicklow. Elizabeth&#x27;s childhood was said to be happy in the countryside with a devoted mother, but her father died in 1871 leaving her inherited Killincarrick House along with nearly 2,000 acres of land spreading across Dublin, Meath and Wicklow at the age of eleven years.

Elizabeth could claim kinship with royalty and aristocracy in Europe through her Bentick great-grandmother and at the age of eighteen she joined London society and married her first husband Captain Fred Burnaby, a British Army intelligence officer, in 1879. She gave birth to her son Harry Burnaby in 1880. A few months after the birth, she and her husband began leading primarily separate lives until his death in the battle of Sudan on 17 January 1885.

In the time leading up to his death, Elizabeth had been spending her time searching for a cure to the lung difficulty she was experiencing.

In 1881 she moved to Switzerland.

In 1886, Elizabeth married her second husband John Frederick Main. The marriage was short lived when he died alone in North America in 1892.

In 1900 she married her third husband, Aubrey Le Blond.

She died on 27 July 1934, and was buried at Brompton cemetery in London.

== Authorship ==
Elizabeth wrote her books under both her former name, Elizabeth Hawkins Whitshed and her latter name of Aubrey Le Blond. She also used the pseudonym Jean Ville for some of her writings.She took great joy in the authorship of her books along with her love of photography alike. Her first book was published in 1883, The High Alps of Winter, the precursor to a series of books and articles describing her mountaineering experiences. However, she would later decide to turn her hand to fiction, travel writing and family history. Although her talent for writing books was evident, she was most fond of photography, carrying her camera on her shoulder everywhere she went. Between her most widely known hobbies of mountaineering, photography and writing books, there are currently 69 works in 220 publications in 3 languages and 2,228 library holdings known, worldwide.

== Mountaineering ==

Abandoning conventional mid 1880s London lifestyle, Mrs. Hawkins ended up in Chamonix where her first climb was making two thirds up of the way up Mont Blanc. She is known now for the photos of her climbing a skirt, however she would change when out of public sight to avoid causing offence. The interior of her tent at the bottom of most mountains she climbed gave us an idea of her social status: nice clothing, a comfortable bed, drapes, and her own elaborate toilette can be found inside. Her health declined due to trouble in her lungs, but that did not prevent her from going on expeditions. On the contrary, her time spent abroad was also used in search for a cure, and this activity pushed her to better herself.

In the summer of 1881, she moved to Switzerland at the heart of European mountaineering. During that summer, Hawkins scaled the Mont Blanc twice and several other difficult peaks in Switzerland within twenty years. Further down her career, Elizabeth abandoned Switzerland for Lapland and Norway. Spending six consecutive summers in the Norwegian Arctic shined light on uncharted territory. This led to Hawkins completing over one hundred ascents, twenty of which were first ascents. During her expeditions, however, Hawkins would take advantage of her wealth and social status by being accompanied by personal staff. To prove how dangerous the conditions can get during ascents, Elizabeth&#x27;s personal maid once had to be carried out their carriage when it was completely covered in ice.

In 1907, Hawkins set up and became the first president of the Ladies Alpine Club. She showed great courage and provided inspiration to future generations for females taking part in activities deemed masculine.

== Photography ==
Almost from the beginning of her climbing career Elizabeth carried her camera with her, capturing views which had never been seen before she also took up photography and was an early adopter of snow photography. She was elected to membership of the Photographic Society of Great Britain later the Royal Photographic Society in 1886. She also exhibited regularly in the Photographic Society&#x27;s annual exhibition between 1885 and 1903, under the names of Jean Ville, Mrs Main and Mrs [Aubrey] Le Blond. 

Over the years she took thousands of photographs, about four hundred of which were included in various publications, Including &quot;Water, its Origin and Use&quot; by William Coles Finch. Elizabeth developed and printed her own work often in terrible conditions and would sell them in aid of charity, give them as gifts, or give them as a prize at mountaineering events. The Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum in Chanute, Kansas USA is home to over 2,000 photographs of Elizabeth&#x27;s taken between 1886 and 1903. Many of the photographs have captions and descriptions written by Elizabeth that do not appear in her known publications.

An exhibition was held at the Pontresina Alpine Museum in 2003 and a collection of her photographs published in a volume which the Greystones Historical Society presented to the local library during National Heritage Week 2011. An exhibition of Elizabeth&#x27;s photographs and archives from the Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum was curated in house upon the donation of her collection in 2013 and a permanent display of her works called Queen of the Mountain installed at the Safari Museum in November 2023.

<text>Eliza Alice Lynch (Charleville, County Cork, Ireland, 19 November 1833 – Paris, France, 25 July 1886) was the Irish mistress-wife of Francisco Solano López, president of Paraguay.

Slandered as the most vilified woman in Latin American history, she was dubbed as &quot;an ambitious courtesan&quot; who seduced the &quot;heir apparent&quot; of the Government of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, turning him into &quot;a bloodthirsty dictator.&quot; However, all those accusations were part of the propaganda-warfare by the allies during the Paraguayan War, and are now disproven. 

Nowadays, she is considered as a &quot;National Heroine&quot; of Paraguay.

==Early life==
She was born Eliza Alicia Lynch in Charleville, County Cork, Ireland, at the time located within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. She was the daughter of John Lynch, MD and Jane Clarke Lloyd, who was from a family of officers of the Royal Navy. She emigrated at the age of ten with her family to Paris to escape the Great Irish Famine. On 3 June 1850, she married Xavier Quatrefages, a French officer who was shortly afterwards posted to Algeria. She accompanied him, but at eighteen years of age, due to deteriorating health, she returned to Paris to live with her mother in the Strafford household. Courtesy of a few fortuitous introductions, she later entered the elite circle surrounding Princess Mathilde Bonaparte and quickly set herself up as a courtesan.

Eliza Lynch was described as possessing a figure, golden blonde hair and a provocative smile. In 1854, Eliza met General Francisco Solano López, son of Carlos Antonio López, the president of Paraguay. The young general, in training with the French army, regarded his country&#x27;s interests above all as fundamental reasons for his European journey. However, Lynch and López would begin a relationship which led her to return with him during that same year to Paraguay.

==Paraguay==

Once in Paraguay, Eliza Lynch became López&#x27;s partner, bearing him six children in total. The eldest of them, Juan Francisco &quot;Panchito&quot; López was born in Asunción in 1855. The last child she would bear to López, Leopoldo, was born in 1867 in the midst of the Paraguayan War, and died soon afterwards of dysentery, as a result of the poor conditions at the front.

After C.A. López died in 1862, he left his son F.S. López as his successor as president. Eliza then became the &quot;de facto&quot; first lady, as she and López never actually married. Eliza Lynch would spend the next fifteen years as the most powerful woman in the country. While she never married López, her marriage to Quatrefages was annulled on the grounds that it did not fulfil the legal obligations for it to be considered a lawful marriage (he had not received permission to marry from his commanding officer, and they had no children together). This is supported by his remarriage in 1857, a marriage from which he had children.

She arguably is considered to be the reason López was so ambitious. However, in a book she wrote in 1876 while in Buenos Aires titled &quot;&quot;Exposición. Protesta que hace Elisa A. Lynch&quot; (Exposition. Protest made by Elisa A. Lynch)&quot; she states that she had actually no knowledge of and did not meddle in political affairs, rather dedicating her time during the war to helping the wounded and the innumerable families which followed López wherever he went.

===Battle of Cerro Corá===
Lynch followed López during the entire war and led a group of women called &quot;Las Residentas&quot;, composed of the soldiers&#x27; wives, daughters, and others, who supported the soldiers. It was in this role that she came to be in Cerro Corá on 1 March 1870 when López was finally killed. One of these women was Ramona Martínez, who became known as &quot;the American Joan of Arc&quot; for her fighting and encouragement of the soldiers.

After the Brazilian forces killed López, they headed towards the civilians in order to capture them. López and Lynch&#x27;s eldest son Juan Francisco, who had been promoted to colonel during the war and was fifteen years old, was with her. The Brazilian officers told him to surrender, and upon replying &quot;Un coronel paraguayo nunca se rinde&quot; (A Paraguayan colonel never surrenders) he was shot and killed by the allied soldiers. At this Lynch, after jumping and covering her son&#x27;s body, exclaimed &quot;¿Esta es la civilización que han prometido?&quot; (&quot;Is this the civilization you have promised?&quot;) in reference to the allies&#x27; claim that they intended to free Paraguay from a tyrant and deliver freedom and civilization to the nation. She then buried both López and her son with her bare hands before being taken as prisoner.

==Life after the war, and death==

After being taken prisoner she was taken on board a ship called the &quot;Princesa&quot; (Princess) to Asunción, where she was banished from the nation by the newly established provisional government, constituted by Paraguayans who had fought in favour of the allied forces and against López&#x27;s army. She returned to Europe with her remaining children; and after five years, and under promises of the then-elected Paraguayan president Juan Bautista Gill that she would be respected, she decided to return to Paraguay to settle there and try to claim her former property. Upon arrival, however, she was tried and banished from the country permanently by President Gill. It was during these events that she wrote her book.

Eliza Lynch died in obscurity in Paris on 25 July 1886. Over one hundred years later, her body was exhumed and brought back to Paraguay where the dictator General Alfredo Stroessner proclaimed her a national heroine. Her remains are now located in the national cemetery &quot;Cementerio de la Recoleta&quot;.

==Legacy and historical perception==
Some historians believe that Eliza Lynch was responsible for inducing Francisco Solano López to start the Paraguayan War. During her time as First Lady, Eliza Lynch educated Paraguayan society in many European customs and was largely responsible for the introduction of social events and clubs. She is considered a prominent figure of the war for her support of the troops and her willingness to remain with López until the bitter end. She also introduced the protocol dinners with the ambassadors and ordered the composition of several songs as London Karape. This music has endured until now. She transformed the Paraguayan woman into her way of dressing and thinking. Lynch is known as Madam or Madama Lynch in Paraguay due to her European origins, the fact that she never married López, and the implications of her past as a courtesan.

===Fiction===
Eliza Lynch is often noted as the Paraguayan predecessor to the Argentine Evita (without the change of heart from aristocratic elitism to champion of the downtrodden). Due to the melodramatic appeal of her story, many fictionalized accounts of her life were written at the time and up to the present day, but the historical record is somewhat ignored and liberties are taken to maximize dramatic effect. Novels include:

* William Edmund Barrett, &quot;Woman on Horseback&quot; (1938)
* Graham Shelby, &quot;Demand the World&quot; (1990)
* Anne Enright, &quot;The Pleasure of Eliza Lynch&quot; (2003)
* Lily Tuck, &quot;The News from Paraguay&quot; (2004), which won the National Book Award for that year

<doc id="202533" wikidata="Q2303056" url="?curid=202533" title="Shepherd's pie">
<text>Shepherd&#x27;s pie, cottage pie, or in French cuisine hachis Parmentier, is a savoury dish of cooked minced meat topped with mashed potato and baked, formerly also called Sanders or Saunders. The meat used may be either previously cooked or freshly minced. The usual meats are beef or lamb. The terms shepherd&#x27;s pie and cottage pie have been used interchangeably since they came into use in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, although some writers insist that a shepherd&#x27;s pie should contain lamb or mutton, and a cottage pie, beef.

==History==

===Cottage pie===

The term was in use by 1791. Parson Woodforde mentions &quot;Cottage-Pye&quot; in his diary entry for 29 August 1791 and several times thereafter. He records that the meat was veal but does not say what the topping was. The dish was known in its present form, though not under the same name, in the early 19th century: in 1806 Maria Rundell published a recipe for &quot;Sanders&quot;, consisting of the same ingredients as cottage or shepherd&#x27;s pie: minced beef or mutton, with onion and gravy, topped with mashed potato and baked as individual servings. Sanders or Saunders could also have a filling of sliced meat. According to Jane Grigson in &quot;English Food&quot;, mincing originally meant chopping something with a knife. &quot;But with the first mincing-machines, prison, school and seaside boarding house cooks acquired a new weapon to depress their victims, with watery mince, shepherd&#x27;s pie with rubbery granules of left-over meat.&quot;

In 20th-century and later use the term cottage pie has widely, but not exclusively, been used for a dish of chopped or minced beef with a mashed potato topping. The beef may be fresh or previously cooked; the latter was at one time more usual. Well into the 20th century the absence of refrigeration made it expedient in many domestic kitchens to store cooked meat rather than raw. In the 1940s the chef Louis Diat recalled of his childhood days, &quot;when housewives bought their Sunday meat they selected pieces large enough to make into leftover dishes for several days&quot;. Modern recipes for cottage pie typically use fresh beef.

===Shepherd&#x27;s pie===
A recipe for shepherd&#x27;s pie published in Edinburgh in 1849 in &quot;The Practice of Cookery and Pastry&quot; specifies cooked meat of any kind, sliced rather than minced, covered with mashed potato and baked. In the 1850s the term was also used for a Scottish dish that contained a mutton and diced potato filling inside a pastry crust. Neither shepherd&#x27;s pie nor cottage pie was mentioned in the original edition of Mrs Beeton&#x27;s &quot;Household Management&quot; in 1861.

More recently &quot;shepherd&#x27;s pie&quot; has generally been used for a potato-topped dish of minced lamb. According to the &quot;Oxford Companion to Food&quot;, &quot;In keeping with the name, the meat should be mutton or lamb; and it is usually cooked meat left over from a roast&quot;. As with beef, it was commonplace in the days before refrigeration to cook a Sunday joint to last in various guises throughout the week. Dorothy Hartley quotes a traditional verse, &quot;Vicarage mutton&quot;, showing not only the uses to which the joint was put, but also the interchangeability of the terms &quot;shepherd&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;cottage&quot; pie:
&lt;poem&gt;
 Hot on Sunday,
 Cold on Monday,
 Hashed on Tuesday,
 Minced on Wednesday,
 Curried Thursday,
 Broth on Friday,
 Cottage pie Saturday.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Hachis Parmentier===
The dish Hachis Parmentier is named after Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, who popularised the potato in French cuisine in the late 18th century. It is documented from the late 19th century. It is usually made with chopped or minced lamb or beef; in either case it may be made with either fresh or left-over cooked meat. (The modern English term &quot;hash&quot; derives from the French , meaning food &quot;finely chopped&quot;.)

In some recipes a layer of sauté potatoes is put in the cooking dish before the meat filling and mashed potato topping are added. A more elaborate version by Auguste Escoffier, named Hachis de boeuf à Parmentier, consists of baked potatoes, the contents of which are removed, mixed with freshly-cooked diced beef, returned to the potato shells and covered with sauce lyonnaise.

==Variations==

There are no universally agreed ingredients for any of the variants. The 26 recipes cited in the table show the varieties of titles and ingredients recommended by cooks and food writers from Australia, Britain, Canada, France and the US.
==Similar dishes==
Fillings for other pies with a mashed potato topping are numerous, and include artichoke hearts and red peppers; black pudding; chicken and spinach; chorizo; curried chicken; duck; rabbit; salmon; salt cod; turkey and ham; and flaked white fish with shrimps in a white sauce.

<doc id="202536" wikidata="Q52950" url="?curid=202536" title="Louis Gerhard De Geer">
<text>Baron Louis Gerard De Geer af Finspång (18 July 181824 September 1896) was a Swedish statesman, lawyer and writer. He was the first Prime Minister of Sweden.

== Biography ==
De Geer was born at Finspång Castle in Risinge parish, and was a member of the De Geer family. He was a lawyer, and in 1855 became president of the Göta Court of Appeal, or lord justice for the appellate court of Götaland. From 7 April 1858 to 3 June 1870 he was Prime Minister for Justice and again from 11 May 1875 to 20 March 1876. As a member of the nobility, he took part in the Swedish Riksdag of the Estates from 1851 onwards. From 1867 to 1878 he was the member for Stockholm in the first chamber in the New Riksdag, where he introduced and passed many useful reforms.

According to his &quot;Minnen&quot; (&quot;Memoirs&quot;) he considered himself a Liberal, in sympathy with universal suffrage. He never tried, however, to introduce legislation which he deemed impossible to get through the Riksdag.

=== Architect of the New Riksdag ===
De Geer&#x27;s greatest political achievement was the reform of the Swedish representative system. The reforms introduced a bi-cameral elected Riksdag replacing the existing cumbersome and less democratic Riksdag of the Estates, a hangover from the later Medieval period. This measure was accepted by the Riksdag in December 1865, and received the royal sanction on 22 June 1866. For some time after this De Geer enjoyed considerable popularity. He retired from the ministry in 1870, but took office again, as Prime Minister of Justice in 1875. 

=== First Prime Minister ===
In 1876 De Geer became the first Prime Minister of Sweden following a reform where the previous offices of Prime Minister for Justice (which he held at the time) and Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs were changed into Minister for Justice and a Minister for Foreign Affairs. He served until April 1880, when the failure of his repeated efforts to settle the armaments issue again induced him to resign. From 1881 to 1888 he was Chancellor for the Universities of Uppsala and Lund. He was an advocate of free trade and economic liberalism. Some argue that it was De Geer who laid the foundations for the strong economic growth in Sweden from 1870 to 1970.

== Literary works ==
Besides several novels and aesthetic essays, De Geer wrote a few political memoirs of supreme merit both as to style and matter, the most notable of which are &quot;Minnesteckning öfver A. J. v. Höpken&quot; (Stockholm, 1881); &quot;Minnesteckning öfver Hans Järta&quot; (Stockholm, 1874); &quot;Minnesteckning öfver B. B. von Platen&quot; (Stockholm, 1886); and his own &quot;Minnen&quot; (Stockholm, 1892), an autobiography, invaluable as a historical document, in which the political experience and the matured judgments of a lifetime are recorded with singular clearness, sobriety and charm. For example, his explanation of why he, at such a young age, was appointed Prime Minister of Justice, was that in the narrow circles of Swedish nobility at the time, it was difficult to find anyone with at least the mediocre intelligence which was needed for the office.

<text>Calisia (, ) was a &quot;station&quot; on the so-called &quot;Amber Road&quot;, mentioned by Ptolemy, formerly universally identified with Kalisz in Poland. Besides the similarity of the names, the identification was supported by the closeness between the latitude given by Ptolemy (52°50&#x27;) and the actual latitude of Kalisz (51°45&#x27;27&quot;).

The validity of these arguments is currently in doubt, mainly due to the identification of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Leukaristos&quot;, located at a latitude similar to that of Kalisz, with the name Laugaritio/Leugaritio certainly referring to the town of Trenčín in Slovakia (this identification is confirmed by a rock inscription made in the winter of 179/180 CE by a Roman military unit, and the biography of the unit&#x27;s commander, M. Valesius Maximianus, carved on his tomb in Diana Veteranorum in today&#x27;s Algeria). As Trenčín is much further south than the latitude given by Ptolemy, this identification seems to imply that Ptolemy&#x27;s data on latitude of places north of the Danube had significant errors, hence making the Calisia-Kalisz identification doubtful.

<text>Clannad () were an Irish band formed in 1970 in Gweedore, County Donegal, by siblings Ciarán, Pól and Moya Ui Bhraonáin (in English, Brennan) and their twin uncles Noel and Pádraig Ó Dúgáin (Duggan). They have adopted various musical styles throughout their history. Beginning as an acoustic folk group mainly performing rearranged traditional Irish songs in Irish, they expanded their sound with original songs in English, vocal harmonies, electronic keyboards, and elements of rock, Celtic, new age, smooth jazz, and Gregorian chant.

Initially known as Clann as Dobhar (&#x27;Family from Dore&#x27;), they shortened their name to Clannad in 1973. By 1979 they had released three albums and toured Europe and the US. From 1980 to 1982 they operated as a six-piece with their sister and niece Eithne (Enya). In 1982 they gained international attention with their single &quot;Theme from Harry&#x27;s Game&quot;. They experimented with New Age and pop-influenced sounds in the 1980s and 1990s and their music came to be defined as almost purely Celtic, making them innovators of that genre. In 1997, after 15 albums, they took a break and pursued solo projects. The band regrouped in 2007 as a four piece with Moya, Ciarán, Noel and Pádraig and completed a world tour in 2008. In 2013, Pól rejoined and they released their first studio album in fifteen years. Pádraig Duggan died in 2016 and the group embarked on their farewell tour in 2020 as a quartet.

Clannad have won numerous awards throughout their career, including a Grammy Award, a BAFTA, an Ivor Novello Award, and a Billboard Music Award. They have recorded in six different languages and scored eight UK top 10 albums. They were often more popular abroad than in their native Ireland, and are considered to have brought Irish music and the Irish language to a wider audience.

==History==

===Formation===
Clannad was formed by siblings Ciarán, Pól, and Máire Brennan and their twin uncles Noel and Pádraig Duggan. They grew up in Dore, a remote parish in Gweedore, County Donegal in north-western Ireland, a Gaeltacht region where Irish was the main spoken language. They were raised as a Roman Catholic family of musicians: the Brennans&#x27; mother, Máire &quot;Baba&quot; Brennan (née Duggan), the daughter of the local headmaster, was a music teacher and their father, Leo Brennan, who played saxophone and accordion, was a member of the Slieve Foy, an Irish showband that had toured Scotland and Ireland. In 1968, the Brennan and Duggan fathers bought and restored a dilapidated old tavern in nearby Meenaleck and ran it as a music bar called Leo&#x27;s Tavern. Their children performed there together and developed their own act, with Ciaran and Pol Brennan on bass, vocals and bongos, Padraig and Noel Duggan on guitars, and elder Brennan sister Moya on harp and vocals.

The five young musicians made their live debut in 1970 at a music competition held during the inaugural Slógadh Youth Festival in Letterkenny. Máire, the eldest member, who had learned the harp and could play &quot;holy songs and Brian Boru&quot;, was elected lead vocalist. They had not intended to enter the competition, but were encouraged to try by the local police sergeant and family members, and they submitted their entry form with ten minutes to spare before the post was to be collected. They won the Slógadh competition prize of £500, a trophy and a recording contract with Polydor Records, although the band members were too young to sign it. With help from a grandfather they had named themselves Clann as Dobhar, Irish for Family from Dore, and they used this name until 1973, when they shortened the name to Clannad.

They established themselves as an acoustic folk group, collecting material from old singers and story-tellers in Donegal and building a repertoire of traditional Irish songs, arranged in a contemporary style for a full band. This approach attracted criticism at first because the Irish language was associated with poverty, but as Pól Brennan recalled: &quot;Once they said that [...] we just had to do it even more.&quot; They also wrote original material, and covered songs by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Joni Mitchell.

===1973–1982: early years and six-piece band with Enya===

In 1973, Clannad came in first place in the Letterkenny folk festival and were offered a deal with Philips Records, which they negotiated themselves. Having secured a label, the group prepared material for a debut album. They recorded at Eamonn Andrews Studios in Dublin, choosing Irish and English songs and a cover of &quot;Morning Dew&quot; by Bonnie Dobson. Released in 1973, &quot;Clannad&quot; was met with initial resistance from the label because of the use of Irish, and the group soon found themselves more popular outside Ireland, particularly in Germany. Later in 1973, Clannad competed for Ireland in the heat stages of the 1973 Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;An Pháirc&quot;.

In 1974, the band followed their debut album with &quot;Clannad 2&quot;, released by Gael Linn Records and produced by Dónal Lunny, the founder of Planxty and The Bothy Band. Like their first album, &quot;Clannad 2&quot; featured a mixture of English and Irish songs, with Lunny and members of the Bothy Band on additional instruments. It also featured the band&#x27;s first use of a synthesizer.

Their next album, &quot;Dúlamán&quot; (&quot;Seaweed&quot;), was released in 1976. It was named after the Irish folk song &quot;Dúlamán&quot;, which became a stage favourite. The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales and was their first to be produced by Nicky Ryan, who also became the group&#x27;s manager alongside his wife Roma Ryan. Clannad capitalised on their growing popularity in Europe by including liner notes in German and French and undertaking a tour of Europe. At one show, the standing ovation the band received after an extended rendition of &quot;Níl Sé Ina Lá (Níl Sé&#x27;n Lá)&quot; from &quot;Clannad&quot; convinced them to continue as full-time musicians. Recordings from a tour of Switzerland in 1978 were released in the following year as &quot;Clannad in Concert&quot;. Also in 1979, Clannad undertook a 36-date tour of North America, the most extensive by an Irish band at that time.
In 1980, Clannad became a six-piece band when Nicky Ryan invited a younger Brennan sister, Enya Brennan, to join as an additional singer and keyboard player in order to expand the group&#x27;s sound via extra vocals and electronic instruments. Enya&#x27;s first recordings with Clannad were made as a guest musician on their fifth studio album, &quot;Crann Úll&quot; (&quot;Apple Tree&quot;), which was recorded in Cologne, Germany and released in 1980 on Tara Music. &quot;Ar a Ghabháil &#x27;n a &#x27;Chuain Domh&quot; featured a particularly full band arrangement which reflected their live jams, while &quot;Lá Cuimhthíoch Fán dTuath&quot; showed early hints of a more atmospheric side to the band&#x27;s arrangements.

By the time Clannad entered Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin to record their next album, &quot;Fuaim&quot; (&quot;Sound&quot;), Enya had become a full-time member. This album continued the group&#x27;s experimentation with electronic instruments, and Enya was featured on lead vocals on &quot;An tÚll&quot; and &quot;Buaireadh an Phósta&quot;. Neil Buckley played clarinet and saxophone, with Noel Bridgeman on percussion and Pat Farrell on electric guitar. &quot;Fuaim&quot; was released by Tara Music in 1982. Despite Nicky Ryan&#x27;s attempt to steer Clannad towards a more layered, electronic, heavily-produced direction, he felt that they had a tendency to revert to their original folk music style; following arguments and a band meeting during a 1982 European tour, the Ryans resigned as group managers. Enya, feeling increasingly restricted in a band setting, departed with them to pursue a solo career (with the Ryans as collaborators).

===1982–1985: &quot;Theme from Harry&#x27;s Game&quot; and &quot;Magical Ring&quot;===

In 1982, the now five-piece Clannad signed to RCA Records and acquired Dave Kavanagh as their new manager. They accepted an invitation to record the title music for &quot;Harry&#x27;s Game&quot;, a three-part television drama depicting The Troubles in Northern Ireland, based on the novel of the same name by Gerald Seymour. Seymour suggested that the band record music for the show. Ciarán, Pól, and Máire wrote &quot;Theme from Harry&#x27;s Game&quot; in a few hours. It was recorded in two days and became an atmospheric piece featuring a Prophet-5 synthesizer and over 100 tracked vocals, a departure from their usual acoustic folk sound. Released as a single in October 1982, &quot;Theme from Harry&#x27;s Game&quot; became the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough and caught international attention. It peaked at No.2 in Ireland and No.5 in the UK, and reached the top-20 in the Netherlands and Sweden. It remains the only UK hit single to have been sung entirely in Irish. Clannad&#x27;s national exposure increased further when they performed the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. From 1983 to 1987, Irish rock band U2 used the song at the end their concerts.
Following this success, the group released their seventh studio album, &quot;Magical Ring&quot;, in March 1983. In addition to &quot;Theme from Harry&#x27;s Game&quot;, it featured a mix of original and traditional Irish songs plus a cover of &quot;I See Red&quot; by Jim Rafferty. The album peaked at No.26 in the UK, and became the group&#x27;s first album to be certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Two singles were released from the album: &quot;I See Red&quot; went to No.19 in Ireland and No.81 in the UK, and &quot;Newgrange&quot; reached No.30 and No.65, respectively. In April 1983, Clannad were awarded a &quot;Hot Press&quot; Music Award for their impact on Irish music in the previous year. Around this time, Maire noted that although the group had lost fans of their traditional folk sound, they had gained new ones as a result of their commercial success.

A month after &quot;Magical Ring&quot; was released, the band were commissioned to score the 26-episode television drama series &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;, which was broadcast on ITV from 1984 to 1986. They created music for a range of characters and events related to the legend of Robin Hood and, for the first time, they recorded entirely in English. In May 1984, a soundtrack album from the series was released as &quot;Legend&quot; and reached No.9 in New Zealand and No.15 in the UK. The theme tune of the series was released as a single entitled &quot;Robin (The Hooded Man)&quot; that went to No.19 in Ireland and No.42 in the UK. Clannad won a BAFTA for Best Original Television Music, the first Irish band to win it, in 1985. In 1984, the band embarked on their first major concert tour of the UK, which was followed by a 18-month world tour, including dates across the US and USSR.

===1985–1989: &quot;Macalla&quot; and &quot;Sirius&quot;===
In 1985, Clannad released their next album, &quot;Macalla&quot; (&quot;Echo&quot;), which was recorded in Switzerland, England and Ireland. Apart from one traditional song the album contained all original material, and yielded a hit single, &quot;In a Lifetime&quot;, a duet with U2 singer Bono, which began with Máire teaching Irish to Bono during the introduction. The album featured numerous backing musicians, who continued to work with the band on tour, including ex-King Crimson saxophonist Mel Collins, Moving Hearts&#x27; guitarist Anthony Drennan, and drummer Paul Moran. Also on board was producer Steve Nye, who oversaw the pop-flavoured &quot;Closer to Your Heart&quot; and the ballad &quot;Almost Seems (Too Late to Turn)&quot; which became hit singles. &quot;Almost Seems&quot; served as the Children in Need charity single in 1985. In 1986 the band put out their first compilation album, &quot;The Collection&quot;.

In October 1987, Clannad worked with American producers Greg Ladanyi and Russ Kunkel, drummer of James Taylor&#x27;s band, on their next album, &quot;Sirius&quot;. The album was given a contemporary pop-influenced sound and production, creating the impression that it was recorded in the US, although it was recorded in the UK and mixed in Los Angeles. Máire Brennan recalled that the band had been at an experimental stage at the time and said Ladanyi and Kunkel had not listened to their previous records. Ciaran thought the music had been &quot;sandpapered down to be a radio-friendly album&quot;, and that the production had relied too heavily on a computer. &quot;Sirius&quot; featured &quot;Something to Believe In&quot;, a duet with Bruce Hornsby on vocals and keyboards, and guest appearances by Steve Perry and JD Souther. In February 1988, the band began a world tour which included dates across Europe, Australia and the US, to commemorate their fifteenth anniversary.

In between their 1988 tour dates, the group scored three episodes of the BBC wildlife documentary series &quot;Natural World&quot; about the Atlantic Ocean, which were broadcast in January 1989. A soundtrack album of the score was released as &quot;Atlantic Realm&quot; and went to No.41 in the UK. In addition, Clannad released a second compilation album, &quot;Pastpresent&quot;, which focused on their output 1982-on, with two new tracks: &quot;The Hunter&quot; and &quot;World of Difference&quot;. The album was a commercial success, peaking at No.5 in the UK, where it was certified Platinum for over 300,000 copies sold. It was promoted with a sell-out UK tour and the release of a double A-side single, &quot;Hourglass&quot; with &quot;Theme from Harry&#x27;s Game&quot;, although &quot;Hourglass&quot; was not on the compilation. Clannad provided music for &quot;The Angel and the Soldier Boy&quot;, an animated film narrated by actor Tom Conti. Ciarán and Pól Brennan wrote the music, which was performed by the band. A soundtrack with the same name was released in 1989. Also in 1989, Clannad won four Clio Awards for their music used in a US advertisement produced by An Bord Fáilte.

===1989–2000: four-piece band, &quot;Anam&quot;, &quot;Banba&quot;, and &quot;Lore&quot;===
In 1989, Pól Brennan left Clannad to work with Peter Gabriel as a producer for the WOMAD arts festival and as an acoustic specialist. The band continued as a four-piece and wrote, arranged and recorded their next album, &quot;Anam&quot; (&quot;Soul&quot;), in under three months, with Ciarán Brennan becoming their producer and primary songwriter. Released in October 1990, the album peaked at No.14 in the UK. Its US release followed in 1992 and included &quot;In a Lifetime&quot; and &quot;Theme from Harry&#x27;s Game&quot;, which had appeared in the film &quot;Patriot Games&quot; (1992) and a Volkswagen television advert, boosting the group&#x27;s recognition. The interest generated by the Volkswagen advert saw &quot;Anam&quot; reach No.46 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the group&#x27;s highest position on the chart. In 1996, the album reached gold certification in the US after selling 500,000 copies. The track won a Billboard Music Award for World Music Song of the Year. &quot;Rí na Cruinne&quot; was included on &quot;One World One Voice&quot;, a charity album intended to raise awareness of environmental issues.
In 1990, the group&#x27;s sister/niece Bridin Brennan joined the group for live performances, supplying additional instruments and backing vocals. Around this time a documentary on the band&#x27;s 20-year history was produced, entitled &quot;Clannad in Donegal&quot;. In 1991, Clannad released a cover version of &quot;Both Sides Now&quot; by Joni Mitchell on which they duetted with singer Paul Young. The track had been recorded for the Blake Edwards film &quot;Switch&quot;.

In late 1992, the group started working on material for their next album, &quot;Banba&quot;. Ciarán wrote fifteen songs in his home studio, and he and Maire picked out tracks to develop further and produced demos, then arranged the best parts into complete songs. Released in May 1993, the album went to No.5 in the UK and No.110 in the US. It featured &quot;I Will Find You&quot;, written for the film &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1992) and had Máire singing in English, Mohican, and Cherokee. Maire said director Michael Mann had liked their Irish songs, but they were unsure of writing a song about early American history in Irish and opted instead to use native languages. An English version was also recorded. &quot;Banba&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Age Album and, like its predecessor, it achieved Gold certification in the US after selling 500,000 copies. The album was supported by Clannad&#x27;s 20th anniversary UK tour, which ended in July 1993 with a concert at Lincoln Castle.

By early 1996, Clannad had recorded and finished the next album, &quot;Lore&quot;, but its release was delayed after the band tried to leave BMG and sign a worldwide deal with Atlantic Records, their US distributor. Released in March 1996, the album, which featured American drummer Vinnie Colaiuta, reached No.14 in the UK and debuted at No.1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top World Albums chart, displacing Gipsy Kings after their 24-week run at the top. &quot;Croí Cróga&quot; (&quot;Brave Heart&quot;) was originally written for the Mel Gibson film &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995), but did not make the final cut. &quot;Farewell Love&quot; was used in the soundtrack of the Irish drama film &quot;A Further Gesture&quot; (1997). Clannad&#x27;s tour to promote the album included their first sell-out shows in Japan. In 1996, Clannad received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Irish Recorded Music Association. In April 1996, the group split with their manager, Dave Kavanagh, after 14 years.

Clannad returned in 1997 with the album &quot;Landmarks&quot;. In the song &quot;Of This Land&quot;, Máire sang about Ireland&#x27;s past and future. The track &quot;Fadó&quot; (&quot;Long Ago&quot;) demonstrated the influences of Celtic history on the band&#x27;s music. In 1999 &quot;Landmarks&quot; won the group a Grammy award for Best New Age Album. Also in 1999, the group wrote &quot;What Will I Do&quot; for the Kevin Costner romantic drama film &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;.

===2000–2024: hiatus, five-piece reunion, &quot;Nádúr&quot;, and final tour===

Between 1999 and 2007, Clannad were largely inactive while individual members pursued solo projects. In 2003, BMG/RCA released the greatest hits album &quot;The Best of Clannad: In a Lifetime&quot;, which peaked at No.23 in the UK. In the following year, the Duggan twins recorded together for the first time outside of Clannad and released an album, &quot;Rubicon&quot;, under the name The Duggans.

Clannad reunited for a one-off performance in 2006 during Moya Brennan&#x27;s solo concert in De Doelen, the Netherlands, which was dedicated to their parents, Leo and Máire Brennan. The whole of Clannad, including former member Pól Brennan and sister Deirdre, performed five songs together in the second half of the concert. Leo and Máire, who were present, did not know that this was planned. The performance was greeted with standing ovations from the audience. In January 2007, the five original members of Clannad performed at the Celtic Connections Festival in Glasgow. In the following month, the group received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the annual Meteor Ireland Music Awards in Dublin.

In March 2008, Clannad began their first UK tour in over 12 years. In May 2008, Clannad&#x27;s version of the traditional song &quot;Down by the Salley Gardens&quot; was featured in the listening paper for Music GCSE from the Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations exam board. Also in 2008, two compilation albums were released: &quot;Celtic Themes: The Very Best of Clannad&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In 2009, Clannad were nominated for an IMA Award for Best Revival Act.

In 2011, Pól Brennan returned to the group as a full-time member for the first time since 1990. He said later that the most exciting thing about his return was writing songs with his brother Ciarán again. In January 2011, two additional concerts were scheduled at Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin after high demand for tickets. The group appeared on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on 21 January, performing &quot;Theme from Harry&#x27;s Game&quot; with vocal ensemble Anúna. It was their first appearance on the show in 14 years.

In September 2013, Clannad released &quot;Nádúr&quot;, their first studio album since 1998. It was the band&#x27;s final album before the death of Padraig Duggan in 2016. They began an international tour in October 2013 which started in Australia and New Zealand and continued through 2014. In 2016, Moya Brennan announced she had been diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive lung disease that required her to rephrase the vocals to some songs.

In February 2020, BMG announced the release of &quot;In a Lifetime&quot;, a greatest hits set to commemorate the band&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary. Released on April 3 by BMG, the album was available on CD, vinyl, digital platforms, and a deluxe edition that contained over 100 tracks spanning their career. The set included two new tracks, &quot;A Celtic Dream&quot; and &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes&quot;, their first recordings since Padraig Duggan&#x27;s passing. The album coincided with the In a Lifetime Tour, their final tour as a group, which was to take place in the UK and North America between March and October 2020. The tour was postponed after several shows because of the COVID-19 pandemic and resumed in 2021. Noel Duggan died on 15 October 2022, aged 73. The band performed a farewell concert at the 3Arena in Dublin on 18 February 2023. The tour concluded in Seattle, Washington on October 9, 2023, after which Clannad planned to disband, with individual members pursuing solo projects.

However, the band later played their final concert in Royal Albert Hall on October 30, 2024. The first half comprised a 40th anniversary reprise of &quot;Legend&quot; and other &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; material, with many of the actors in attendance. The second other of their catalogue.

==Musical style and legacy==

When Clannad first started out in the early 1970s, their music and sound stemmed solely from their traditional Irish background. They popularised such old songs as &quot;Dúlamán&quot;, &quot;Teidhir Abhaile Riú&quot; and &quot;Coinleach Glas An Fhómhair&quot;, and these songs remained favourites at their concerts. After departing from their folk and traditional background in 1982, they created a new sound that was to define the meaning of New Age and Celtic music. When &quot;Theme from Harry&#x27;s Game&quot; and &quot;Newgrange&quot; were first heard, radio stations all over the world were fascinated by an unearthly and spiritual sound that they had not heard before. One critic said &quot;the tunes were steeped in the old ways, but the production and the arrangement was fresh and inventive&quot;. This transition in Clannad&#x27;s career is often seen as the birth of Celtic music, and they are regarded as pioneers of the genre. They are also noted for their melodious harmonies, which have been at the heart of their music since their first album. &quot;Legend&quot; (1984) was based on English folklore, and with later albums Clannad delved further into the realms of electronica and pop. Many of their singles entered pop charts around the world and widened their fan base. Despite their success with this genre of music, the group maintained a link with their Gaelic roots, giving traditional Irish songs such as &quot;Tráthnóna Beag Aréir&quot; and &quot;Buachaill Ón Éirne&quot; the Clannad treatment.

While the rock-infused &quot;Sirius&quot; and the pop-inclined &quot;Macalla&quot; were successful, the style that the band created themselves has left the greatest legacy. Its influence can be found in the soundtrack of the film &quot;Titanic&quot;, where composer James Horner imitated Clannad&#x27;s musical style and the soundtrack sounded so much like Clannad that it has been mistakenly attributed to them. The band&#x27;s &#x27;Celtic mysticism&#x27; is a recurring theme in the film &quot;Intermission&quot;. Lead singer Moya Brennan said that Clannad&#x27;s &quot;otherworldly&quot; and &quot;ethereal&quot; sound came from the ancient hills and glens that surrounded Gweedore. Traces of Clannad&#x27;s legacy can be heard in the music of many artists, including Enya, Altan, Capercaillie, The Corrs, Loreena McKennitt, Anúna, Riverdance, Órla Fallon and U2. Bono said Moya had &quot;one of the greatest voices the human ear has ever experienced&quot;.

A Japanese visual novel released in 2004, which spawned a 2007 film and a 2007–08 television series based on it, was named after the band because screenwriter Jun Maeda mistakenly believed it to mean the word &quot;family&quot; in Irish.

==Brennan family==
The Brennans are Ireland&#x27;s most successful music family; in 2005, the combined record sales of Clannad and Enya exceeded 70 million. Leo Brennan (born Leopold Henry Brennan-Hardin) and Máire &quot;Baba&quot; Duggan are the parents of the Brennan siblings Máire (Moya), Ciarán, Pól, Deirdre, Leon, Eithne (Enya), Olive, Bartley, and Brídín. Brennan was a musician who played in an Irish showband, the Slieve Foy, and Duggan was an amateur musician who taught music at Gweedore Community School and led the local choir, Cór Mhuire Doire Beaga. The family lived in Dore, a parish in Gweedore, County Donegal.

In 1968, the pair bought Leo&#x27;s Tavern in Meenaleck for £1,500.

<text>The Libyan Desert (not to be confused with the Libyan Sahara) is a geographical region filling the northeastern Sahara Desert, from eastern Libya to the Western Desert of Egypt and far northwestern Sudan. On medieval maps, its use predates today&#x27;s Sahara, and parts of the Libyan Desert include the Sahara&#x27;s most arid and least populated regions; this is chiefly what sets the Libyan Desert apart from the greater Sahara. The consequent absence of grazing, and near absence of waterholes or wells needed to sustain camel caravans, prevented Trans-Saharan trade between Kharga (the Darb al Arbein) close to the Nile, and Murzuk in the Libyan Fezzan. This obscurity saw the region overlooked by early European explorers, and it was not until the early 20th century and the advent of the motor car before the Libyan Desert started to be fully explored.

==Nomenclature==
The term &quot;Libyan Desert&quot; began to appear widely on European maps in the last decades of the 19th century, typically identified as straddling the borders of present-day Egypt and Libya. This name derived from a territory known as Ancient Libya. (It was not until 1934 that former Ottoman Tripolitania became known as Libya.) In his book &quot;Libyan Sands&quot;, Ralph Bagnold went as far as to suggest that the Libyan Desert was a separate geographical entity from the Sahara, cut off by the mountains and plateaus of the Ennedi and Tibesti in northern Chad, and the Akakus and Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer along the Algerian border in the west. Since that time the meaning has come to revert to the definition given above.

==Geography==
The Libyan Desert covers an area of approximately , and extends approximately from east to west, and 1,000 km from north to south, in about the shape of a rectangle slanting to the south-east. Like most of the Sahara, this desert is primarily sand and hamada or stony plain.

Sand plains, dunes, ridges, and some depressions (basins) typify the endorheic region, with no rivers draining into or out of the desert. The Gilf Kebir plateau reaches an altitude of just over , and along with the nearby massif of Jebel Uweinat is an exception to the uninterrupted territory of basement rocks covered by layers of horizontally bedded sediments, forming a massive sand plain, low plateaus, and dunes.

The desert features a striking diversity of landscapes including mountains, oases, and sand seas.

To the south lie the main mountain ranges, from the Jebel Uweinat (), on the Libya-Egypt-Sudan border, the Tibesti to the south, on the border with Chad, and the Acacus to the southwest.
The main oases are Jaghbub and Jalo in east, in Cyrenaica, Kufra in the southeast, and Murzuk in the south, in Fezzan. The sand seas lie in a ring around the border of Libya. To the east lies the Calanshio Sand Sea, the western lobe of the Great Sand Sea straddling the Libya-Egypt border, and stretches from Jaghbub and Jalo in the north to Kufra in the south. To the south-east lies the Rebiana Sand Sea, near the border with Sudan. To the south west is the Idehan Murzuq, bordering Chad, and to west lies the Idehan Ubari, bordering Algeria. The sand seas contain dunes up to in height, and cover approximately one quarter of the total desert region.

Other features are the Aswad al Haruj (the &quot;Black Desert&quot;), a large circular region of black volcanic shield in the centre of the country, and the (the &quot;Red Desert&quot;) a rocky plateau to the west, on the Tunisian border, coloured by iron oxide deposits. To the southeast, between Kufra and the Libya-Egypt-Sudan border, lies the Jebel Arkenu, with the associated Arkenu structures, thought to be caused by meteorite strikes. North of the Gilf Kebir plateau, among the shallow peripheral dunes of the southern Great Sand Sea, is a field of Libyan desert glass. This is thought to be associated with a meteorite impact, marked by the Kebira crater, on the Libya-Egypt border. A specimen of the desert glass was used in a piece of Tutankhamun&#x27;s ancient jewellery.

The Libyan Desert is barely populated apart from the modern settlements at oases of the lower Cyrenaica region in southeastern Libya. The indigenous population are Bisharin tribe, Mahas, and Berber. Where the desert extends into Egypt and no longer in Libya, it is generally known as the &quot;Western Desert&quot;. The term &quot;Western Desert&quot; contrasts with the Eastern Desert to the east of the Nile River, which lies between the Nile and the Red Sea.

==Climate==
The Libyan desert is said to be one of the least hospitable regions on Earth. Its climate is surprisingly variable, being hot in summer, with average daytime temperatures of and above, though this drops rapidly at night. In winter, days are cool, with temperatures averaging , but at night this can drop below freezing, with temperatures of recorded. At these times the formation of hoar frost is not uncommon, and they are known as &quot;White Nights&quot;. 

In the north, along the Mediterranean shore, cool onshore winds blow inland, while further south, hot, dry winds, known as &quot;Ghibli&quot;, blow from the interior, creating blinding sand-storms. Periodic droughts are common in the desert, often lasting several years.

==History==

===Historical desert===
Historically, &quot;Libya&quot; referred to an ill-defined area to the west of Ancient Egypt, whose boundary traditionally was the lake of Mareotis, outside Alexandria. The ancient Greeks, such as Herodotus, regarded the whole of the North African littoral, to Cape Spartel in Morocco, as &quot;Libya&quot;. Later, the Romans organized the region the provinces of Libya Inferior and Libya Superior, which covered western Egypt and Cyrenaica. Thus the &quot;Libyan Desert&quot; was the desert to the south of Ancient Libya. With the organization of the Italian colony of Libya in the 20th century the term &quot;Libyan Desert&quot; for this region became a misnomer, and the area of desert within Egypt became known as the &quot;Western Desert&quot; (i.e. west of the Nile, in contradistinction to the Eastern Desert, east of the Nile).

===World War I===

Following the conquest of the territory by Italy during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12, the desert became the scene of a two-decade struggle between the Italians and the Senussi starting from 1915, who were centred on the Jebel Akhdar in Cyrenaica and on the Kufra oasis. It ended in 1931 with the conquest of Kufra by the Italians.

===Modern exploration===
During the 1930s the Libyan desert was the scene of exploration and mapping by the Italian Army and Air Force. Others, such as Ralph Bagnold and László Almásy also travelled in south-eastern Libya and southern Egypt, searching for the lost oasis of Zerzura. Bagnold also travelled into northern Chad, to the Mourdi Depression, recording his findings in his book &quot;Libyan Sands: Travel in a Dead World&quot;, which was published in 1935.

===World War II===

During the Second World War the north-eastern desert between El Agheila and the Egyptian border was the scene of heavy fighting between the Axis powers and the Western Allies, a period known as the Western Desert Campaign. The deep desert saw operations by the Italian Auto-Saharan Companies, in combat with the Allied Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) and the Free French &quot;Régiment de Tirailleurs Sénégalais du Tchad&quot; (RTST). Other actions included the Siege of Giarabub (now Jaghbub), the battle of Kufra and the raid on Murzuk, all in 1941.

The Calanshio Sand Sea is the site of the missing World War II aircraft &quot;Lady Be Good&quot;. The wreck was discovered north of Kufra 15 years after it was reported missing in 1943.

<text>Moya Brennan (born Máire Philomena Ní Bhraonáin on 4 August 1952), also known as Máire Brennan, is an Irish folk singer, songwriter, harpist, and philanthropist. She is the sister of the musical artist known as Enya. She began performing professionally in 1970 when her family formed the band Clannad. Brennan released her first solo album in 1992 called &quot;Máire&quot;, a successful venture. She has received a Grammy Award from five nominations and has won an Emmy Award. She has recorded music for several soundtracks, including &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;To End All Wars&quot; and &quot;King Arthur&quot;.

== Musical upbringing ==
Máire Philomena Ní Bhraonáin was born on 4 August 1952 in Dublin after her parents eloped from County Donegal to marry in County Louth. Máire grew up as the eldest child of a musical family in the remote parish of Gweedore (&quot;Gaoth Dobhair&quot;), a Gaeltacht area in County Donegal, where the Irish language and tradition continue to flourish. Her mother Máire (née Ní Dhúgáin or &quot;Duggan&quot; in English) was a music teacher and her father, Leo Brennan, was a member of a cabaret band with whom she performed as a child.

Moya is the eldest of nine children. She has four sisters, Deirdre, Eithne (better known as Enya), Olive and Brídín, and four brothers, Ciarán, Pól, Leon and Bartley. She sang along with her siblings in the family pub, Leo&#x27;s Tavern in the village of Meenaleck, a short distance from the family home. She also took part in pantomimes at the local &quot;Amharclann Ghaoth Dobhair&quot; (Gweedore Theatre). After leaving secondary school, Brennan spent a few years at the Royal Irish Academy of Music in Dublin studying the harp, the piano and singing. She has also taught music at Holy Cross College in Falcarragh, County Donegal.

== Years with Clannad ==

In 1970, Brennan joined her two brothers Pól and Ciarán, and their mother&#x27;s twin brothers Noel and Pádraig Ó Dúgáin, and eventually formed Clannad. They were introduced to television by Irish musician and broadcaster Tony MacMahon. After enjoying a decade of being among the world&#x27;s foremost Irish musical groups, Clannad graduated to chart success in 1982 with the album &quot;Magical Ring&quot;. Brennan was at the forefront of the group&#x27;s success and her voice suddenly became synonymous with Celtic music and Irish music. She recorded 17 albums with Clannad and has won a Grammy, a BAFTA and an Ivor Novello award with the quintet. Her sister, Eithne Ní Bhraonáin, spent a couple of years with Clannad in the early 1980s, and went on to pursue a very successful solo career as Enya.

Following Clannad&#x27;s 2008 reunion tour, it was announced that Brennan would be working on a new unplugged album with the group, for release in 2009, but that never came to fruition.

== Solo career ==
Brennan released her first solo album in 1992, &quot;Máire&quot;, on Atlantic Records. &quot;Misty Eyed Adventures&quot; on BGM followed three years later. In 1998, Brennan signed with Word Records and released &quot;Perfect Time&quot;, and &quot;Whisper to the Wild Water&quot; a year later. The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album in 2001. Brennan is managed by her husband Tim Jarvis and her brother Leon Ó Braonáin. Her music is usually classified as New Age or Celtic. She accepts the Celtic label, but has at times indicated a slight discomfort with being seen as &quot;New Age&quot; as much of her music is strongly Christian, with several of her songs centring on maintaining a relationship with Jesus. Some of her songs show influences from her Roman Catholic upbringing or seem relational due to her own views concerning Mary, the mother of Jesus.

In 2000, her autobiography, &quot;The Other Side of the Rainbow&quot;. was published and she also performed her song &quot;Perfect Time&quot; live at World Youth Day in Rome in front of crowds of pilgrims and Pope John Paul II. There were 2.1 million people present, making it the largest crowd ever gathered in the Northern Hemisphere. She considered it an honour as she believes in mutual respect among Christians. Moya also recorded on the event&#x27;s album, &quot;One&quot;. She recorded a duet with Booley, now known as Duke Special. The song, titled &quot;Peace Has Broken Out&quot;, is about the Troubles in Ireland.

In film, she was featured vocalist on &quot;King Arthur&quot; (2004), co-writing the title theme &quot;Tell Me Now (What You See)&quot; with Hans Zimmer and wrote additional music score for &quot;To End All Wars&quot; (2001). In 1995, she duetted with Shane MacGowan with &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot; for the movie &quot;Circle of Friends&quot;. Brennan has collaborated with many other musicians, including Chicane, Alan Parsons, Bono, Robert Plant, Van Morrison, Michael McDonald from the Doobie Brothers, Bruce Hornsby, Joe Elliott, The Chieftains, Paul Young, Paul Brady, Michael Crawford, Joe Jackson and Ronan Keating.

In total Brennan has recorded 25 albums, and has sold 20 million records. Since 2002, she has promoted herself as Moya Brennan — a spelling closely resembling the phonetic pronunciation of her name for those not familiar with the Irish variant of the spelling – and, in 2009, she legally changed her name by deed poll. Under this name she released an album entitled &quot;Two Horizons&quot; in 2003 under her new label, Universal. She has also collaborated with dance artist Chicane for performing the vocals on the single &quot;Saltwater&quot;, which was also featured in the VisitScotland advertising campaign, as well as having been used by Fáilte Ireland to promote Ireland, and by Belfast city council, both in television adverts.

On 17 March 2004, she performed at the Speaker&#x27;s Luncheon on Capitol Hill in front of President George W. Bush and Irish dignitaries.

During the World Youth Day 2005 in Cologne, she performed with Pope Benedict XVI in the Vigil in front of a million people and was also part of the official WYD CD &quot;Building on World&quot;.

2006 saw the release of her Christmas album, simply entitled &#x27;An Irish Christmas&#x27;, although it was originally planned to bear the title &#x27;Love Came Down&#x27;. A year later, Brennan released her album &#x27;Signature&#x27;, which she described as a collection of snapshots of her life. The album featured only one Irish song but featured choruses and backing vocals in her native language throughout.

While touring with the latter album, during 2007 and 2008, Moya recorded several collaborations and guest vocals on albums by Iona, Joanne Hogg and with Grand Canal on Ireland&#x27;s Official Olympic Anthem, &quot;Green to Gold. All three recordings were in aid of several charities.

Her 2008–2009 live album &quot;Heart Strings&quot; was recorded with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and Julie Feeney. Moya has toured to promote the album extensively in the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland and England.

In 2009, Brennan recorded the official soundtrack on Maryland Public Television documentary film &#x27;Intrepid Journal&#x27; which documents 50 years of American foreign policy, from World War II to the September 11 attacks.

In April 2010, Moya released a new studio album with harpist and live band member Cormac de Barra. &quot;My Match Is a Makin&#x27;&quot; was recorded for her Spring 2010 tour of the Netherlands, and is available only during her tours. The album is expected to become more widely available in 2010.

Moya Brennan announced that she was working on a hymns album, possibly for 2010 release and would release a new acoustic music album with Clannad in 2010 or 2011. The new Clannad album is slated for a 2013 release in September.

Brennan was the featured headliner for the Atlanta Celtic Christmas concert, recorded live by Georgia Public Broadcasting on 18–19 December 2010. This annual festive event at Emory University&#x27;s Schwartz Center spans music and dance from Irish, Scottish, and Appalachian traditions.

Moya Brennan appeared as well on the album &quot;Excalibur III – The Origins&quot; written by Alan Simon, a musician who comes from Brittany (France). She sang, indeed, on the following tracks : &quot;The Origins Part I and II&quot;, &quot;Incantations&quot; and &quot;Sacred Lands&quot;.
Moreover, she went in July 2012 to Brocéliande, in Brittany, where she performed as soloist before performing at the concert &quot;Excalibur III – The Origins&quot;.

Brennan was scheduled to perform at the National Geographic Society in Washington, DC on 17 March 2012.

In 2013, Moya Brennan released a new studio album called Voices &amp; Harps – Affinity in collaboration with harpist Cormac de Barra as a follow-up to the album Voices &amp; Harps, which was released in 2011. It contains brand new tunes composed by Brennan and de Barra, several traditional tunes in Irish and a cover after Christopher Cross&#x27; song &quot;Sailing&quot; which also serves as the album&#x27;s lead single.

2017 saw Brennan release &quot;Canvas&quot;, her first solo album in almost a decade. Co-written by her two children, Aisling and Paul, the album was released on 24 February 2017 and was supported by a UK, Irish and European tour through 2018.

In 2020, Brennan was part of an Irish collective of female singers and musicians called &quot;Irish Women in Harmony&quot;, that recorded a version of the song &quot;Dreams&quot; in aid of the charity Safe Ireland, which deals with domestic abuse which had reportedly risen significantly during the COVID-19 lockdown.

=== Moya Brennan Band ===
Moya Brennan tours with a large band of musicians who have each recorded solo projects in the past or have recorded with their own bands. The band includes harpist and television presenter Cormac de Barra. Between August 2008 and February 2009, two new members joined Moya&#x27;s band, the first changes since her &quot;Two Horizons Tour&quot;, including Irish singer Daithí Rua. 
In 2012, Moya&#x27;s daughter, Aisling Jarvis, became a permanent member of her band. Aisling joins Brennan on all solo tours, as well as Moya&#x27;s project with Cormac DeBarra, &quot;Voices &amp; Harps&quot;.

== Legacy and recognition ==
Brennan and Clannad are credited with the creation of contemporary Celtic music and are held in high esteem for their vast contribution to bringing new life to old Irish songs. They have been compared to Seán Ó Riada, in that they brought the Irish language into popular culture through their music. One critic said: &quot;Clannad&#x27;s music offers a terrific fusion between traditional and modern influences.&quot; U2 singer Bono (who duetted with Brennan on the Clannad song &quot;In a Lifetime&quot;) said of her voice: &quot;I think Máire has one of the greatest voices the human ear has ever experienced.&quot; Brennan also plays harp, which she has featured on many Clannad records, with her album &quot;Two Horizons&quot; being based on the discovery of the harp. Brennan&#x27;s vocal range has once been described as a &quot;breathy soprano&quot;.

In May 2022, Brennan&#x27;s contributions were recognised by the awarding of an honorary doctorate by Dublin City University, alongside aircraft leasing leader Domhnal Slattery, at a ceremony attended by Brennan&#x27;s immediate family, as well as her mother and her sister Enya.

Moya Brennan was announced as Donegal Person of The Year 2023 on 10 February 2024. This follows the 2022 award given to the victims of the Creeslough disaster, of which Moya co-hosted the Together for Creeslough concert in January 2023, alongside Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh, who won the award in 2009. Brennan&#x27;s inauguration ceremony is set to take place on 6 April 2024, at a gala ball held at The Bonnington Hotel in Dublin.

== Personal life ==
Brennan wrote an autobiography called &quot;The Other Side of the Rainbow&quot; in 2000, in which she recalls her upbringing as the eldest of nine siblings in rural Donegal. Along with the highs of success in the music business, she also recounts low periods where alcohol, drugs and an abortion made her re-evaluate her life. She emerged from her &quot;dark years&quot; as a committed Christian, with rekindled faith. She remarried in 1991, having previously been married to a Dublin musician, Pat Farrell, who passed away on January 14, 2023.

==Philanthropy==
Moya Brennan is also a philanthropist.
===Christian Blind Mission===
In 2003, Moya Brennan became Goodwill Ambassador to Christian Blind Mission Ireland (CBM). Brennan&#x27;s first trip was to Congo-Kinshasa, with a group of five others. Due to violence, Moya and her team fled civil unrest and were evacuated to Kenya. She later promised to return to the Congo, which she did in 2005 to airlift three children from isolated jungle villages to Kinshasa.

In that same year, she travelled to Rwanda, where she kept a diary of her experiences. In 2005, she made an Irish-language documentary for TG4 during her visit to Congo, which was broadcast in 2007, and again in 2008 on both TG4 and RTÉ.

Moya also travelled to shanty-towns in Brazil and performed a fund-raising event in the country with Assíria Nascimento in 2007. From there Moya travelled to Belize for the opening of a school for abused children, run by the Liberty Foundation and backed by CBM. At the opening, Brennan brought together the Belizean Prime Minister Said Musa, Minister of Finance, Leader of the Opposition and UK Conservative Party member and businessman with extensive business interest in Belize, Michael Ashcroft, Baron Ashcroft.

The following year, Brennan travelled to Tanzania and has played a major role in bringing the missions of the charity to the forefront. She has also performed concerts worldwide with other Christian Blind Mission Goodwill Ambassadors from Europe.

===Helping those with addiction===
Brennan performs various concerts in aid of charities and groups that work to rehabilitate those affected by drug addiction and alcohol dependency. She also practices religion with her family in Dún Laoghaire, at a church which also reaches out to young people affected by drug and alcohol misuse.

===Nature preservation===
With family band Clannad, Brennan has recorded numerous songs about the needed protection of the landscapes in Ireland and the devastation of pollution around the world. The first song about the matter was recorded for their debut album and was called &quot;An Pháirc&quot;. Throughout Moya&#x27;s solo career, she has recorded various songs on the issue including &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;.

In July 2005, Brennan took part in a protest alongside poet Cathal Ó Searcaigh and locals of County Donegal to protest against the installation of electric cables across various areas of the county due to the harm it could cause to both people and the landscape.

===Other appointments and music===
In 1985, Brennan along with her band members in Clannad donated their song &quot;Almost Seems (Too Late To Turn)&quot; to Children in Need, becoming the British charity appeal&#x27;s first official single.

In 1986, Brennan performed alongside Bono, Bob Geldof and Chris de Burgh for Self Aid. She also performed with Clannad at the concert. Moya and Clannad have long been supporters of Amnesty International and contributed their single &quot;Rí na Cruinne&quot; to the organisation. Brennan has also attended various benefits in both Ireland and England, most notably alongside Van Morrison in 1996.

Brennan has recorded dozens charitable singles and on many more albums with various artists, including &quot;Raphael&#x27;s Journey&quot; by Joanne Hogg in 2008, &quot;Songs for Luca&quot; and &quot;Songs for Luca 2&quot; by Iona, and the official song for Ireland&#x27;s 2008 Olympic Team, &quot;Green to Gold&quot;. Moya also donated her b-side &quot;Ceolfaidh Mé&quot; to the &quot;Field of Hope&quot; album, which also features Bono and The Corrs. In October 2008, Brennan was appointed director for Ireland&#x27;s first Christian satellite radio station, UCB Ireland, which operates from Dublin. Moya also recorded a song under her birth name &quot;Máire Ní Bhraonáin&quot; on the 2009 &quot;Ceol Cheann Dubhrann&quot; album with Manus Lunny to raise funds for Áislann Rann na Feirste and Scoil Náisiúnta Rann na Feirste.

In 2020, Brennan was part of an Irish collective of female singers and musicians called Irish Women in Harmony, that recorded a version of &quot;Dreams&quot; in aid of the SafeIreland charity that deals with domestic abuse, which had reportedly risen significantly during the COVID-19 lockdown.

<text>The Calanshio Sand Sea (Sarīr Kalanshiyū ar Ramlī al Kabīr) is a sand desert region located in the Libyan Desert, in Cyrenaica region&#x27;s Kufra District, eastern Libya. It has a surface of approximately 62,000 km². The erg, an area of actively shifting dunes, extends from Jaghbub and Jalo in the north to Kufra in the south, a distance of 500km.

The erg lies parallel to the Egyptian Sand Sea and is contiguous with it at their northern ends. They contain dunes up to 110m in height: these lie in a roughly north-south direction and were created by the wind.

The Calanshio Sand Sea is the site of the missing World War II B-24 Liberator &quot;Lady Be Good&quot;. The wreck was discovered north of Kufra 15 years after it was reported missing in 1943. The crew bailed out believing they were over the sea, when their plane ran out of fuel, and they became lost. When they landed in the Libyan Desert they could feel a northwesterly breeze. Thinking they were near the Mediterranean, they headed into the wind hoping it would lead them to safety. However, they were more than inland from the Mediterranean, and slowly died from dehydration after covering with minimal water in a place so dry even the desert Bedouins refuse to enter.

<text>Madras Institute of Technology (MIT) is an engineering institute located in Chromepet, Chennai, India. It is one of the four autonomous constituent colleges of Anna University. It was established in 1949 by Chinnaswami Rajam as the first self-financing engineering institute in the country and later merged with Anna University. The institute was among the first educational institutions in India to offer new areas of specialization, such as aeronautical engineering, automobile engineering, electronics engineering and instrumentation technology. Madras Institute of Technology (MIT) was the first self-financing institute opened in India.

Madras Institute of Technology (MIT) is also among the institutes in India that offer postgraduate courses in Avionics and Mechatronics. The institute has a unique practice of &quot;T numbers&quot; that facilitates mentoring of students by their respective seniors.

Established in 1949, Madras Institute of Technology (MIT) initially offered three-year diploma courses (DMIT) in Engineering for Science graduates (B.Sc.). After Anna University was established in 1978, Madras Institute of Technology (MIT) became one of the constituent institutions of the university. After this merging, three-year B.Tech. Degree courses were offered to B.Sc. graduates. Over the years, the institute has expanded its original programmes. Presently, it provides undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Production Engineering, Rubber and Plastics Technology, Computer Science Engineering and Information Technology. Since 1996, the institute has accepted students who have passed the 12th board examinations for its four-year undergraduate programme.

== History ==
After India&#x27;s independence, the need for establishing engineering institutions to propel the industrial development in the country was felt by Chinnaswami Rajam. To establish an institution, Rajam sought the support of distinguished citizens including Subbaraya Aiyar, M.K. Ranganathan, L.Venkatakrishna Iyer, K.Srinivasan and C.R. Srinivasan. He also received generous donations from the industries as well as the public. In July 1949, he founded Madras Institute of Technology (MIT) under the University of Madras.

== Administration ==
Madras Institute of Technology (MIT) is a constituent college of Anna University and is governed by the Chancellor, Vice Chancellor and Registrar of the Anna university. The varsity has a syndicate. The Dean is the head of the institute and oversees day-to-day administration. Each department is led by a Head of the Department (HOD). The hostels are headed by assistant executive wardens placed under an executive warden with Dean as the ex-officio warden.

The academic policies are decided by the course committee that is headed by a chairman. All the professors and student representatives are its members.

Madras Institute of Technology follows the choice based credit system(CBCS) of performance evaluation and student-teacher relation, with proportional weighting of courses based on their importance. The total marks (usually out of 100) form the basis of grades, with a grade value (out of 10) assigned to a range of marks. Each semester, the students are graded by taking a weighted average of all the courses with their respective credit points. Each semester&#x27;s evaluation is done independently with a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) reflecting the average performance across semesters.

Currently, the admission to the institute is through the Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions process based on a Unified Single Window Admission System for the first year of undergraduate courses. Till 2006, TNPCEE was also a mandatory qualification examination along with the Higher Secondary examination.

== T Numbers ==
The practice of &#x27;T numbers&#x27; in MIT facilitates a unique mentorship system. The word is said to have originated from the term Technocrat. Each new &#x27;technocrat&#x27; of the institute is assigned to a mentor from the previous batch. He/she also inherits the complete set of &#x27;T-seniors&#x27; from this mentor. Mentorship activities span a whole gamut of student activities starting from passing on books, counselling, monetary help (if needed), and placement preparation assistance (mock interviews, aptitude tests).

Each Technocrat will also be assigned to a &#x27;T-number&#x27;. The &#x27;T-number&#x27; is a combination of the student&#x27;s batch number, his/her department code and his/her roll number. For example, consider a student who has joined Electronics and Instrumentation Department (Department code is 4). If he/she belongs to the batch of 2007–2011, he/she would be the 60th batch from Electronics and Instrumentation Department and hence his &#x27;T-number&#x27; would be &#x27;604xxx&#x27;, where xxx represents the person&#x27;s roll number. As per the &#x27;T-series&#x27;, this technocrat&#x27;s mentor would be the person with the &#x27;T-number&#x27; &#x27;594xxx&#x27;. Thus, the T-series can be tracked back to even the first batch of students. The best part is that when alumni from earlier batches come for get-togethers years after graduating, they still make it a practice to at least know and interact with their respective &#x27;T-juniors&#x27; from the current batches.

== MIT Museum ==
The MIT museum was inaugurated by Anna University vice-chancellor Dr P Mannar Jawahar on 18 March 2011. In the museum, photographs of all important events related to MIT are exhibited. The museum also chronicles newspaper coverages, books written by MITians and displays a replica of a glider made by the students of the 1952 batch.
==Alumni==
* Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, 11th Honorable President, Republic Of India, Aerospace Scientist
*K. Sivan, space scientist and former chief at ISRO.

== Popular media ==
The Tamil-language feature film, &quot;Five Star&quot; (2002), featured in part, the academic life at MIT. It was partly shot in MIT campus (mainly Hangar-II and hostels) during a semester break, particularly for a song in which many available students participated. The Director of the film, Susi Ganeshan is an MIT alumnus.

<text>First normal form (1NF) is a property of a relation in a relational database. A relation is in first normal form if and only if no attribute domain has relations as elements. Or more informally, that no table column can have tables as values. Database normalization is the process of representing a database in terms of relations in standard normal forms, where first normal is a minimal requirement. SQL-92 does not support creating or using table-valued columns, which means that using only the &quot;traditional relational database features&quot; (excluding extensions even if they were later standardized) most relational databases will be in first normal form by necessity. Database systems which do not require first normal form are often called NoSQL systems. Newer SQL standards like have started to allow so called non-atomic types, which include composite types. Even newer versions like allow JSON.

==Overview==

In a hierarchical database, a record can contain sets of child records ― known as repeating groups or table-valued attributes. If such a data model is represented as relations, a repeating group would be an attribute where the value is itself a relation. First normal form eliminates nested relations by turning them into separate &quot;top-level&quot; relations associated with the parent row through foreign keys rather than through direct containment.

The purpose of this normalization is to increase flexibility and data independence, and to simplify the data language. It also opens the door to further normalization, which eliminates redundancy and anomalies.

Most relational database management systems do not support nested records, so tables are in first normal form by default. In particular, SQL does not have any facilities for creating or exploiting nested tables. Normalization to first normal form would therefore be a necessary step when moving data from a hierarchical database to a relational database.

== Rationale ==
The rationale for normalizing to 1NF:

* Allows presenting, storing and interchanging relational data in the form of regular two-dimensional arrays. Supporting nested relations would require more complex data structures. 
* Simplifies the data language, since any data item can be identified just by relation name, attribute name and key. Supporting nested relations would require a more complex language with support for hierarchical data paths in order to address nested data items.
* Representing relationships using foreign keys is more flexible, where a hierarchical model only can represent one-to many relationships.
* Since locating data items is not directly coupled to the parent-child hierarchy, the database is more resilient to structural changes over time.
* Makes further normalization levels possible which eliminate data redundancy and anomalies.

== Drawbacks and criticism ==

* Performance worsens for certain operations. In a hierarchical model, nested records are physically stored after the parent record, which means a whole sub-tree can be retrieved in a single read operation. In a 1NF form, it will require a join operation per record type, which can be costly, especially for complex trees. For this reason document databases eschew 1NF.
* Object-oriented languages represent runtime state as trees or directed graphs of objects connected by pointers or references. This does not map cleanly to a 1NF relational database, a problem sometimes called the object-relational impedance mismatch and which object relational mapper (ORM) libraries try to bridge.
* 1NF has been interpreted as not allowing complex data types for values. This is open to interpretation though, and C. J. Date has argued that values can be arbitrarily complex objects.

== History ==
First normal form was introduced in 1970 by Edgar F. Codd in the paper &quot;A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks&quot;, although it was initially just called &quot;Normal Form&quot;. It was renamed to &quot;First Normal Form&quot; when additional normal forms were introduced in the paper &quot;Further Normalization of the Relational Model&quot; in 1971.

==Examples==
The following scenarios first illustrate how a database design might violate first normal form, followed by examples that comply.

===Designs that violate 1NF===
This table over customers&#x27; credit card transactions does not conform to first normal form: 

To each customer corresponds a &#x27;repeating group&#x27; of transactions. 
Such a design can be represented in a hierarchical database but not a SQL database, since SQL does not support nested tables.

The automated evaluation of any query relating to customers&#x27; transactions would broadly involve two stages:
# Unpacking one or more customers&#x27; groups of transactions allowing the individual transactions in a group to be examined, and
# Deriving a query result based on the results of the first stage

For example, in order to find out the monetary sum of all transactions that occurred in October 2003 for all customers, the system would have to know that it must first unpack the &quot;Transactions&quot; group of each customer, then sum the &quot;Amounts&quot; of all transactions thus obtained where the &quot;Date&quot; of the transaction falls in October 2003.

One of Codd&#x27;s important insights was that structural complexity can be reduced. Reduced structural complexity gives users, applications, and DBMSs more power and flexibility to formulate and evaluate the queries. A more normalized equivalent of the structure above might look like this:

===Designs that comply with 1NF===
To bring the model into the first normal form, we can perform normalization. Normalization (to first normal form) is a process where attributes with non-simple domains are extracted to separate stand-alone relations. The extracted relations are amended with foreign keys referring to the primary key of the relation which contained it. The process can be applied recursively to non-simple domains nested in multiple levels.

In this example, &quot;Customer ID&quot; is the primary key of the containing relations and will therefore be appended as foreign key to the new relation:

In the modified structure, the primary key is {Customer ID} in the first relation, and {Customer ID, Transaction ID} in the second relation.

Now each row represents an individual credit card transaction, and the DBMS can obtain the answer of interest, simply by finding all rows with a Date falling in October, and summing their Amounts. The data structure places all of the values on an equal footing, exposing each to the DBMS directly, so each can potentially participate directly in queries; whereas in the previous situation some values were embedded in lower-level structures that had to be handled specially. Accordingly, the normalized design lends itself to general-purpose query processing, whereas the unnormalized design does not.

It is worth noting that this design meets the additional requirements for second and third normal form.

==Atomicity==
Edgar F. Codd&#x27;s definition of 1NF makes reference to the concept of &#x27;atomicity&#x27;. Codd states that the &quot;values in the domains on which each relation is defined are required to be atomic with respect to the DBMS.&quot; Codd defines an atomic value as one that &quot;cannot be decomposed into smaller pieces by the DBMS (excluding certain special functions)&quot; meaning a column should not be divided into parts with more than one kind of data in it such that what one part means to the DBMS depends on another part of the same column.

Hugh Darwen and Chris Date have suggested that Codd&#x27;s concept of an &quot;atomic value&quot; is ambiguous, and that this ambiguity has led to widespread confusion about how 1NF should be understood. In particular, the notion of a &quot;value that cannot be decomposed&quot; is problematic, as it would seem to imply that few, if any, data types are atomic:

*A character string would seem not to be atomic, as the RDBMS typically provides operators to decompose it into substrings.
*A fixed-point number would seem not to be atomic, as the RDBMS typically provides operators to decompose it into integer and fractional components.
* An ISBN would seem not to be atomic, as it includes language and publisher identifier.
Date suggests that &quot;the notion of atomicity &quot;has no absolute meaning&quot;&quot;: a value may be considered atomic for some purposes, but may be considered an assemblage of more basic elements for other purposes. If this position is accepted, 1NF cannot be defined with reference to atomicity. Columns of any conceivable data type (from string types and numeric types to array types and table types) are then acceptable in a 1NF table—although perhaps not always desirable; for example, it may be more desirable to separate a Customer Name column into two separate columns as First Name, Surname.

==1NF tables as representations of relations==
According to Date&#x27;s definition, a table is in first normal form if and only if it is &quot;isomorphic to some relation&quot;, which means, specifically, that it satisfies the following five conditions:
Violation of any of these conditions would mean that the table is not strictly relational, and therefore that it is not in first normal form.

Examples of tables (or views) that would not meet this definition of first normal form are:

*A table that lacks a unique key constraint. Such a table would be able to accommodate duplicate rows, in violation of condition 3.
*A view whose definition mandates that results be returned in a particular order, so that the row-ordering is an intrinsic and meaningful aspect of the view. (Such views cannot be created using SQL that conforms to the standard.) This violates condition 1. The tuples in true relations are not ordered with respect to each other.
*A table with at least one nullable attribute. A nullable attribute would be in violation of condition 4, which requires every column to contain exactly one value from its column&#x27;s domain. This aspect of condition 4 is controversial. It marks an important departure from Codd&#x27;s later vision of the relational model, which made explicit provision for nulls. First normal form, as defined by Chris Date, permits relation-valued attributes (tables within tables). Date argues that relation-valued attributes, by means of which a column within a table can contain a table, are useful in rare cases.

<text>Second normal form (2NF), in database normalization, is a normal form. A relation is in the second normal form if it fulfills the following two requirements:
# It is in first normal form.
# It does not have any non-prime attribute that is functionally dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key of the relation (i.e. it lacks partial dependencies). A &quot;non-prime attribute of a relation&quot; is an attribute that is not a part of any candidate key of the relation.

Put simply, a relation (or table) is in 2NF if: 
# It is in 1NF and has a single attribute unique identifier (UID) (in which case every non key attribute is dependent on the entire UID), or 
# It is in 1NF and has a multi-attribute unique identifier, and every regular attribute (not part of the UID) is dependent on &quot;all attributes&quot; in the multi-attribute UID, not just one attribute (or part) of the UID. 
If any regular (non-prime) attributes are predictable (dependent) on another (non-prime) attribute, that is addressed in third normal form.

== History ==
The second normal form was originally defined by E. F. Codd in 1971.

== Decomposition of 1NF into 2NF ==
To make a 1NF relation a 2NF relation, remove the functionally dependent attributes in the partial dependencies of the first normal form relation, and place those partial dependency dependent attributes in a relation where their corresponding determinant attributes are an entire candidate key.

=== Example ===
The following relation does not satisfy 2NF because:
* There is a multi-attribute unique identifier/candidate key: &quot;Manufacturer&quot; and &quot;Model&quot;.
* {Manufacturer country} is functionally dependent (predictable) on {Manufacturer}.
* {Manufacturer} is a proper subset of the {Manufacturer, Model} candidate key.
* {Manufacturer country} is not part of a candidate key, so it is a non-prime attribute. (It is assumed that it is possible for two manufacturers in the same country to make a toothbrush with the same model name, so {Manufacturer country, Model} is not a candidate key even though in the current table the pair uniquely identify rows.)
In other words, since {Manufacturer country} is a non-prime attribute functionally dependent on a proper subset of a candidate key, the relation is in violation of 2NF.

To make the design conform to 2NF, it is necessary to have two relations. To create these relations:
# Remove the functionally dependent attributes in the partial dependencies of the first normal form relation. In this example, {Manufacturer country} is the functionally dependent attribute which will be removed.
# Place those partial dependency-dependent attributes (i.e. {Manufacturer country}) in a relation where their corresponding determinant attributes are a candidate key (i.e. {Manufacturer}).
As seen below, {Manufacturer country} is removed from the original table:

As seen below, the partial dependency is put into a new relation where the dependency can exist without being a partial dependency:

It may now be desirable to add a numeric identifier to each row in the &quot;Electric toothbrush models&quot; table to ensure it remains in 1NF, or, the table may be left as is, allowing each unique combination of values in each row to be usable as a primary key, thus allowing the columns {Manufacturer, Model} in this table to be used as the candidate key of the table.

<text>Third normal form (3NF) is a database schema design approach for relational databases which uses normalizing principles to reduce the duplication of data, avoid data anomalies, ensure referential integrity, and simplify data management. It was defined in 1971 by Edgar F. Codd, an English computer scientist who invented the relational model for database management.

A database relation (e.g. a database table) is said to meet third normal form standards if all the attributes (e.g. database columns) are functionally dependent on solely a key, except the case of functional dependency whose right hand side is a prime attribute (an attribute which is strictly included into some key). Codd defined this as a relation in second normal form where all non-prime attributes depend only on the candidate keys and do not have a transitive dependency on another key. 

A hypothetical example of a failure to meet third normal form would be a hospital database having a table of patients which included a column for the telephone number of their doctor. (The phone number is dependent on the doctor, rather than the patient, thus would be better stored in a table of doctors.) The negative outcome of such a design is that a doctor&#x27;s number will be duplicated in the database if they have multiple patients, thus increasing both the chance of input error and the cost and risk of updating that number should it change (compared to a third normal form-compliant data model that only stores a doctor&#x27;s number once on a doctor table).

Codd later realized that 3NF did not eliminate all undesirable data anomalies and developed a stronger version to address this in 1974, known as Boyce–Codd normal form.

==Definition of third normal form==
The third normal form (3NF) is a normal form used in database normalization. 3NF was originally defined by E. F. Codd in 1971. 

Codd&#x27;s definition states that a table is in 3NF if and only if both of the following conditions hold:
* The relation R (table) is in second normal form (2NF).
* No non-prime attribute of R is transitively dependent on the primary key.

A &quot;non-prime attribute&quot; of R is an attribute that does not belong to any candidate key of R. A transitive dependency is a functional dependency in which &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; (&quot;X&quot; determines &quot;Z&quot;) indirectly, by virtue of &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; (where it is not the case that &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;X&quot;).

A 3NF definition that is equivalent to Codd&#x27;s, but expressed differently, was given by Carlo Zaniolo in 1982. This definition states that a table is in 3NF if and only if for each of its functional dependencies &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;, at least one of the following conditions holds:
* &quot;X&quot; contains &quot;Y&quot; (that is, &quot;Y&quot; is a subset of &quot;X&quot;, meaning &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is a trivial functional dependency),
* &quot;X&quot; is a superkey,
* every element of &quot;Y&quot; \ &quot;X&quot;, the set difference between Y and X, is a &quot;prime attribute&quot; (i.e., each attribute in &quot;Y&quot; \ &quot;X&quot; is contained in some candidate key).

To rephrase Zaniolo&#x27;s definition more simply, the relation is in 3NF if and only if for every non-trivial functional dependency X → Y, X is a superkey or &quot;Y&quot; \ &quot;X&quot; consists of prime attributes. Zaniolo&#x27;s definition gives a clear sense of the difference between 3NF and the more stringent Boyce–Codd normal form (BCNF). BCNF simply eliminates the third alternative (&quot;Every element of &quot;Y&quot; \ &quot;X&quot;, the set difference between &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;X&quot;, is a prime attribute.&quot;).

==&quot;Nothing but the key&quot;==
An approximation of Codd&#x27;s definition of 3NF, paralleling the traditional oath to give true evidence in a court of law, was given by Bill Kent: &quot;[every] non-key [attribute] must provide a fact about the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key&quot;. A common variation supplements this definition with the oath &quot;so help me Codd&quot;.

Requiring existence of &quot;the key&quot; and requiring that non-key attributes be dependent on &quot;the whole key&quot; ensures 2NF; further requiring that non-key attributes be dependent on &quot;nothing but the key&quot; ensures 3NF. While this phrase is a useful mnemonic, the fact that it only mentions a single key means it defines some necessary but not sufficient conditions to satisfy the 2nd and 3rd normal forms. Both 2NF and 3NF are concerned equally with &quot;all&quot; candidate keys of a table and not just any one key.

Chris Date refers to Kent&#x27;s summary as &quot;an intuitively attractive characterization&quot; of 3NF and notes that with slight adaptation it may serve as a definition of the slightly stronger Boyce–Codd normal form: &quot;Each attribute must represent a fact about the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.&quot; The 3NF version of the definition is weaker than Date&#x27;s BCNF variation, as the former is concerned only with ensuring that &quot;non-key&quot; attributes are dependent on keys. Prime attributes (which are keys or parts of keys) must not be functionally dependent at all; they each represent a fact about the key in the sense of providing part or all of the key itself. (This rule applies only to functionally dependent attributes, as applying it to all attributes would implicitly prohibit composite candidate keys, since each part of any such key would violate the &quot;whole key&quot; clause.)

An example of a table that fails to meet the requirements of 3NF is:
Because each row in the table needs to tell us who won a particular Tournament in a particular Year, the composite key {Tournament, Year} is a minimal set of attributes guaranteed to uniquely identify a row. That is, {Tournament, Year} is a candidate key for the table.

The breach of 3NF occurs because the non-prime attribute (Winner&#x27;s date of birth) is transitively dependent on the candidate key {Tournament, Year} through the non-prime attribute Winner. The fact that Winner&#x27;s date of birth is functionally dependent on Winner makes the table vulnerable to logical inconsistencies, as there is nothing to stop the same person from being shown with different dates of birth on different records.

In order to express the same facts without violating 3NF, it is necessary to split the table into two:
Update anomalies cannot occur in these tables, because unlike before, Winner is now a candidate key in the second table, thus allowing only one value for Date of birth for each Winner.

== Computation ==
A relation can always be decomposed in third normal form, that is, the relation R is rewritten to projections R1, ..., Rn whose join is equal to the original relation. Further, this decomposition does not lose any functional dependency, in the sense that every functional dependency on R can be derived from the functional dependencies that hold on the projections R1, ..., Rn. What is more, such a decomposition can be computed in polynomial time.

To decompose a relation into 3NF from 2NF, break the table into the canonical cover functional dependencies, then create a relation for every candidate key of the original relation which was not already a subset of a relation in the decomposition.

==Equivalence of the Codd and Zaniolo definitions of 3NF==
The definition of 3NF offered by Carlo Zaniolo in 1982, and given above, can be shown to be equivalent to the Codd definition in the following way: Let X → A be a nontrivial FD (i.e. one where X does not contain A) and let A be a non-prime attribute. Also let Y be a candidate key of R. Then Y → X. Therefore, A is not transitively dependent on Y if there is a functional dependency X → Y iff X is a superkey of R.

==Normalization beyond 3NF==
Most 3NF tables are free of update, insertion, and deletion anomalies. Certain types of 3NF tables, rarely met with in practice, are affected by such anomalies; these are tables which either fall short of Boyce–Codd normal form (BCNF) or, if they meet BCNF, fall short of the higher normal forms 4NF or 5NF.

==Considerations for use in reporting environments==
While 3NF was ideal for machine processing, the segmented nature of the data model can be difficult to intuitively consume by a human user. Analytics via query, reporting, and dashboards were often facilitated by a different type of data model that provided pre-calculated analysis such as trend lines, period-to-date calculations (month-to-date, quarter-to-date, year-to-date), cumulative calculations, basic statistics (average, standard deviation, moving averages) and previous period comparisons (year ago, month ago, week ago) e.g. dimensional modeling and beyond dimensional modeling, flattening of stars via Hadoop and data science. Hadley Wickham&#x27;s &quot;tidy data&quot; framework is 3NF, with &quot;the constraints framed in statistical language&quot;.

<text>Fourth normal form (4NF) is a normal form used in database normalization. Introduced by Ronald Fagin in 1977, 4NF is the next level of normalization after Boyce–Codd normal form (BCNF). Whereas the second, third, and Boyce–Codd normal forms are concerned with functional dependencies, 4NF is concerned with a more general type of dependency known as a multivalued dependency. A table is in 4NF if and only if, for every one of its non-trivial multivalued dependencies &quot;X&quot; formula_1 &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;X&quot; is a superkey—that is, &quot;X&quot; is either a candidate key or a superset thereof.

==Multivalued dependencies==
If the column headings in a relational database table are divided into three disjoint groupings &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot;, then, in the context of a particular row, we can refer to the data beneath each group of headings as &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; respectively. A multivalued dependency &quot;X&quot; formula_1 &quot;Y&quot; signifies that if we choose any &quot;x&quot; actually occurring in the table (call this choice &quot;xc&quot;), and compile a list of all the &quot;xcyz&quot; combinations that occur in the table, we will find that &quot;xc&quot; is associated with the same &quot;y&quot; entries regardless of &quot;z&quot;. So essentially the presence of z provides no useful information to constrain the possible values of &quot;y&quot;.

A trivial multivalued dependency &quot;X&quot; formula_1 &quot;Y&quot; is one where either &quot;Y&quot; is a subset of &quot;X&quot;, or &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; together form the whole set of attributes of the relation.

A functional dependency is a special case of multivalued dependency. In a functional dependency &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;, every &quot;x&quot; determines &quot;exactly one y&quot;, never more than one.

==Example==
Consider the following example:

Each row indicates that a given restaurant can deliver a given variety of pizza to a given area.

The table has no non-key attributes because its only candidate key is {Restaurant, Pizza variety, Delivery area}. Therefore, it meets all normal forms up to BCNF. If we assume, however, that pizza varieties offered by a restaurant are not affected by delivery area, or the converse, that delivery areas are not affected by pizza varieties (i.e. a restaurant offers all pizza varieties it makes to all areas it supplies), then it does not meet 4NF. The problem is that the table features two non-trivial multivalued dependencies on the {Restaurant} attribute (which is not a superkey). The dependencies are:

* {Restaurant} formula_1 {Pizza variety}
* {Restaurant} formula_1 {Delivery area}

These non-trivial multivalued dependencies on a non-superkey reflect the fact that the varieties of pizza a restaurant offers are independent from the areas to which the restaurant delivers. This state of affairs leads to redundancy in the table: for example, we are told three times that A1 Pizza offers Stuffed Crust, and if A1 Pizza starts producing Cheese Crust pizzas then we will need to add multiple rows, one for each of A1 Pizza&#x27;s delivery areas. There is, moreover, nothing to prevent us from doing this incorrectly: we might add Cheese Crust rows for all but one of A1 Pizza&#x27;s delivery areas, thereby failing to respect the multivalued dependency {Restaurant} formula_1 {Pizza variety}.

To eliminate the possibility of these anomalies, we must place the facts about varieties offered into a different table from the facts about delivery areas, yielding two tables that are both in 4NF:


In contrast, if the pizza varieties offered by a restaurant sometimes did legitimately vary from one delivery area to another, the original three-column table would satisfy 4NF.

Ronald Fagin demonstrated that it is always possible to achieve 4NF. Rissanen&#x27;s theorem is also applicable on multivalued dependencies.

==4NF in practice==
A 1992 paper by Margaret S. Wu notes that the teaching of database normalization typically stops short of 4NF, perhaps because of a belief that tables violating 4NF (but meeting all lower normal forms) are rarely encountered in business applications. This belief may not be accurate, however. Wu reports that in a study of forty organizational databases, over 20% contained one or more tables that violated 4NF while meeting all lower normal forms.

==Normalization beyond 4NF==
Only in rare situations does a 4NF table not conform to the higher normal form 5NF. These are situations in which a complex real-world constraint governing the valid combinations of attribute values in the 4NF table is not implicit in the structure of that table.

<text>Richard Norman Perle (born September 16, 1941) is an American political advisor who served as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Global Strategic Affairs under President Ronald Reagan. He began his political career as a senior staff member to Senator Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson on the Senate Armed Services Committee in the 1970s. He served on the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee from 1987 to 2004 where he served as chairman from 2001 to 2003 under the Bush administration before resigning due to conflict of interests.

A key advisor to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in the Bush administration, Perle was an architect of the Iraq War. In March 2001, he claimed that the Saddam Hussein regime possessed weapons of mass destruction. He has been described as a neoconservative hawk on foreign policy issues. He has been involved with several think-tanks, including the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the Center for Security Policy, the American Enterprise Institute, Project for the New American Century, and the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs.

== Early life and education ==
Perle was born in New York City, New York, the son of Jewish parents, Martha Gloria and Jack Harold Perle. As a child, he moved to California, where he attended Hollywood High School in Los Angeles; his classmates including actor Mike Farrell, singer Ricky Nelson, and Joan Wohlstetter (the daughter of Albert and Roberta Wohlstetter of the Rand Corporation).

Perle earned a B.A. in International Politics in 1964 from the University of Southern California. As an undergraduate he studied in Copenhagen at Denmark&#x27;s International Study Program. He also studied at the London School of Economics and obtained a M.A. in political science from Princeton University in 1967.

== Career ==

=== Office of Senator Henry Jackson ===
From 1969 to 1980, Perle worked as a staffer for Democratic Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington whom he met through Albert Wohlstetter. Perle recalls his early involvement with Wohlstetter: &quot;Albert Wohlstetter phoned me one day. I was still a graduate student at Princeton... and he said, could you come to Washington for a few days and interview some people and draft a report on the current debate shaping up in the Senate over ballistic missile defense, which was a hot issue... And he said, I&#x27;ve asked somebody else to do this too, and maybe the two of you could work together. The someone else was Paul Wolfowitz. So Paul and I came to Washington as volunteers for a few days, to interview people, and one of the people we interviewed was Scoop Jackson and it was love at first sight... I was there for eleven years.&quot;

As a staffer, Perle drafted the Jackson–Vanik amendment to the 1972 International Grains Agreement (IGA), or &quot;Russian Wheat Deal&quot; negotiated by Richard Nixon and the Soviet Union which made for the first time by law a trade agreement contingent upon the fundamental human right of Soviet Jews to emigrate. He was considered an extremely knowledgeable and influential person in the Senate debates on arms control. By his own admission, Perle acquired the reputation of an influential figure who preferred to work in the background, a reputation that has followed him through the years in both the public and the private sectors. At some point (usually said to be during his time in the Reagan administration) Perle acquired the nickname &quot;The Prince of Darkness&quot; due to his hardline opposition to any arms control agreements, which has been used both as a slur by his critics and as a joke by supporters (&quot;Time&quot;, 23 March 1987, &quot;Richard Perle: Farewell Dark Prince&quot;). However, he has been quoted: &quot;I really resent being depicted as some sort of dark mystic or some demonic power... All I can do is sit down and talk to someone...&quot; (&quot;The New York Times&quot;, 4December 1977, &quot;Jackson Aide Stirs Criticism in Arms Debate&quot;, Richard L. Madden)

=== Opposition to nuclear arms reduction ===
Perle was considered a hardliner in arms reduction negotiations with the Soviet Union and has stated that his opposition to arms control under the Carter administration had to do with his view that the U.S. was giving up too much at the negotiation table and not receiving nearly enough concessions from the Soviets. Perle called the arms talks under negotiation in the late 1970s &quot;the rawest deal of the century&quot;.

Perle&#x27;s objection to the arms talks between the Carter administration and the Soviet Union revolved primarily around Carter&#x27;s agreement to halt all cruise missile development. Perle is widely credited for spearheading opposition to the treaty, which was never ratified by the Senate.

Perle, with fellow neoconservative Paul Wolfowitz, played a supporting role in the ballistic missile defense project that was launched in the 1980s called the Strategic Defense Initiative.(&quot;Star Wars&quot;) Perle was influential in creating several organizations and think-tanks in order to pressure public opinion and sway policy makers on ballistic missile defense. During the second Bush administration missile defense programs saw dramatic budget increases under the direction of Perle as chair of the Defense Policy Board.

In 2010, Perle voiced opposition to the Obama administration&#x27;s New START Treaty, comparing it unfavorably to the &quot;watershed&quot; 1987 INF Treaty signed by Ronald Reagan. However, Jonathan Chait has pointed out that Perle vehemently opposed the INF Treaty when it was initially signed, calling it &quot;flawed enough to require renegotiation with the Soviets&quot; and arguing that &quot;the treaty does not do many of the key things the Administration says it does.&quot;

=== Transition into neoconservatism ===

Perle is a self-described neoconservative, like several around Henry M. &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson, as he told Ben Wattenberg in an interview specifically about him becoming a neoconservative.

Perle&#x27;s book &quot;An End to Evil: How to Win the War on Terror&quot; which he coauthored with fellow neoconservative David Frum in 2004 criticizes American bureaucracy, civil service, and law. The book suggests that Americans must &quot;overhaul the institutions of our government to ready them for a new kind of war against a new kind of enemy&quot; including the FBI, CIA, armed forces, and State Department. The book is also used as a defense of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and outlines important neoconservative ideas, including ways to abandon all Israeli-Palestinian peace processes, invade Syria, and implement strict US domestic surveillance with biometric identity cards and public vigilance to hinder potential terrorist immigrant or terrorist sympathizer threats. Perle and Frum conclude: &quot;For us, terrorism remains the great evil of our time, and the war against this evil, our generation&#x27;s great cause... There is no middle way for Americans: it is victory or holocaust.&quot; 

====Neoconservative leadership====

Over the past few decades, a tight-knit group of neo-conservatives have had a significant impact in the carving out of American foreign policies, especially those concerning the Middle East. Arguably at the helm of the neoconservative movement is Richard Perle. He has been aided by other prominent neoconservatives, including Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith.

Members of the Neocon core have been interrelated for decades through positions in government, think-tanks, business corporations, and even family ties. As journalist and writer of neoconservative ideology Jacob Heilbrunn states: &quot;neo-conservatism was turned into an actual movement by Irving Kristol and Norman Podhoretz. Even today, the neoconservative movement is best described as an extended family based largely on the informal social networks patiently forged by these two patriarchs.&quot;

Members of the neoconservative movement are also leaders of many influential &quot;letterhead organizations&quot; (LHO&#x27;s) and think-tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute, Project for the New American Century, Committee for Peace and Security in the Gulf, Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, and the U.S. Committee for a Free Lebanon. These organizations act as a support system for many neoconservative beliefs and help members of the movement draft policy papers, raise money and media attention, and lobby policymakers in order to protect their own political and personal agendas. A sociologist who examined the memberships of such neoconservative organizations ultimately concluded that &quot;the activities of fourteen organizations were coordinated by individuals who comprised a web of interlocking memberships.&quot;

From 1981 to 1982, Wolfowitz was appointed head of the policy planning staff in the State Department. In the same year Perle, who was an assistant secretary for international security policy in President Reagan&#x27;s defense department hired and promoted Douglas Feith after he had been fired from his position as a Middle East analyst at the National Security Council. Later it was found out that Feith was fired due to an FBI investigation suspecting that he had distributed confidential materials to an Israeli embassy official. With the right connections and the support of his close allies Wolfowitz and Perle, Feith was able to attain his position as undersecretary for policy in the Pentagon in 2001, from which he resigned in 2005. In return, he appointed Perle as chairman of the Defense Policy Board. This friendship was mutually beneficial for both Perle and Feith, who used their overlapping positions of power to help promote the other and bail each other out of trouble. Perle is nonetheless an inspiration and mentor to Feith who describes him as a &quot;godfather&quot; and trusts that &quot;He would actively work to help anybody he had worked with and liked and admired and who he thought was useful to the overall cause of U.S. national security as he saw it.&quot; Both Wolfowitz and Feith later worked closely together to promote the War in Iraq after 9/11, including heading the Office of Special Plans.

=== War with Iraq ===

====Pre-2003 invasion====

Like many in the neoconservative movement, Perle had long been an advocate of regime change in Iraq. In 1998 Perle led an effort known as the Project for the New American Century with close neoconservative allies Wolfowitz, Woolsey, Elliott Abrams, and John Bolton. The Project culminated in a letter sent to US President Bill Clinton calling for the military overthrow of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime. Prior to and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Perle held several exclusive meetings in his home where he discussed issues regarding American foreign policy on Iraq. In an effort to help fund their goals, Ahmed Chalabi an Iraqi-born businessman and founder of the Iraqi National Congress, helped Perle secure millions of dollars from the U.S. government in 1990. Chalabi was one of the key figures driving the war in Iraq and helped transmit important &quot;information&quot; to U.S. Congress and the public that would successfully help sell the war effort. Moreover, Perle and Chalabi also had very similar motives: they both wanted the Hussein regime deposed and Chalabi elected president.

In 2004, the FBI investigated Chalabi after U.S. intelligence sources revealed that he was working as a double agent for Iran. Perle was also involved in efforts to develop alternative intelligence estimates to help justify the decision to go to war in Iraq. He and other neoconservative leaders claimed that the intelligence community had grossly underestimated threats to the national security of the U.S. Thus, they established two secret offices in the Pentagon after September 11 – the Counter Terrorism Evaluation Group and the Office of Special Plans. Nonetheless, Perle helped manage and hire neoconservative affiliated staff for both these organizations that created their own policies and intelligence reports by dodging existing government entities. Perle&#x27;s reasoning for implementing the Office of Special Plans was essentially to &quot;bring in people with fresh eyes to review the intelligence that the CIA and other agencies had collected.&quot; In an interview with CNN on September 16, 2001, Perle announced &quot;Even if we cannot prove to the standards that we enjoy in our own civil society that they were involved, we do know, for example, that Saddam Hussein has ties to Osama Bin Laden...&quot; Flynt Leverett, a senior staff member of the Bush National Security Council states: &quot;There were constant efforts to pressure the intelligence community to provide assessments that would support their views. If they couldn&#x27;t get what they wanted out of the intelligence community, they simply created their own intelligence.&quot; Moreover, Perle allegedly gave several speeches and talks throughout Europe trying to promote the war effort abroad. He allegedly told the British House of Commons that the U.S. would attack Iraq even if UN weapons inspectors didn&#x27;t find anything. Lawrence Wilkerson, former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell announced that Perle was &quot;making remarks as if he were an official inside the U.S. government.&quot; In countries like Germany, France, Britain, and Japan, people perceived him as a government authority whose knowledge and clout on U.S. policy appeared legitimate.

Perle argued that what he referred to as terrorist Abu Nidal&#x27;s &quot;sanctuary&quot; in Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq was justification for the U.S. military invasion of Iraq. Perle states this in the recent PBS documentary series &quot;America At A Crossroads&quot;, and refers to President Bush&#x27;s 9/11 speech in which Bush stated: &quot;We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.&quot; In an interview for &quot;Saddam&#x27;s Ultimate Solution&quot;, the 11 July 2002 episode of the PBS series &quot;Wide Angle&quot;, he said: &quot;Saddam is much weaker than we think he is. He&#x27;s weaker militarily. We know he&#x27;s got about a third of what he had in 1991. But it&#x27;s a house of cards. He rules by fear because he knows there is no underlying support. Support for Saddam, including within his military organization, will collapse at the first whiff of gunpowder. Now, it isn&#x27;t going to be over in 24 hours, but it isn&#x27;t going to be months either.&quot; Perle advocated invading Iraq with only 40,000 troops, and complained about the calls by then Gen. Eric Shinseki to use 660,000 troops. He preferred a strategy similar to that used in the Afghan war, in which the U.S. would insert SOF (Special Operations Forces), along with some two divisions, to assist native Kurdish and Shi&#x27;ite rebels, much as the United States had done with the Northern Alliance against the Taliban.

====Iraq policy and Bush criticism====
The Senate Intelligence Committee eventually discovered that President Bush and his advisers heavily exaggerated the claims of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and terrorist ties to Al Qaeda which were not validated by U.S. intelligence units. Since this scandal, Perle has made several attempts to reduce his alleged involvement in the war efforts stating: &quot;Huge mistakes were made, and I want to be very clear on this: They were not made by neoconservatives, who had almost no voice in what happened...&quot; In an interview he gave &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; that was excerpted in an article appearing in the 4November 2006 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, he denied having a role in the planning of the war. He is reported to have told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m getting damn tired of being described as an architect of the war.&quot; This is not congruent with his signing of the PNAC letter in 1998. &quot;I was in favor of bringing down Saddam. Nobody said, &#x27;Go design the campaign to do that.&#x27; I had no responsibility for that.&quot; The same &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article reports that Perle now believes that his advocacy of the Iraq war was wrong.

Perle expressed regret of his support of the invasion and faulted the &quot;dysfunction&quot; in the Bush administration for the troubled occupation. &quot;I think now I probably would have said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s consider other strategies for dealing with the thing that concerns us most, which is Saddam supplying weapons of mass destruction to terrorists&#x27;. The decisions did not get made that should have been. They didn&#x27;t get made in a timely fashion, and the differences were argued out endlessly. At the end of the day, you have to hold the president responsible.&quot;
Nevertheless, Perle vociferously defended the war in Iraq, arguing to the wife of a deployed soldier in a 2007 PBS film that to end the war now would be to dishonor those who had already died in the cause.

====Disputed role in Bush administration====
Conservative commentator David Brooks has said that, in his opinion, Perle&#x27;s influence in the Bush administration is exaggerated. In a 2004 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Brooks wrote that; &quot;There have been hundreds of references... to Richard Perle&#x27;s insidious power over administration policy, but I&#x27;ve been told by senior administration officials that he has had no significant meetings with Bush or Cheney since they assumed office. If he&#x27;s shaping their decisions, he must be microwaving his ideas into their fillings&quot;.

==== On Iraq Study Group proposals ====
In a December 2006 interview with &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, Perle strongly criticized the Iraq Study Group proposals, saying: &quot;I have never seen such a foolish report... A report that begins with false premises ends with nothing.&quot;

===Other views on foreign policy===

====United Nations====

Perle is a frequent critic of the United Nations, stating that it is an embodiment of &quot;...the liberal conceit of safety through international law administered by international institutions... &quot;
He has also attacked the United Nations Security Council veto power as a flawed concept, arguing that the only time the U.N. utilized force during the Cold War was when &quot;...the Soviets were not in the chamber to veto it&quot;.

Furthermore, shortly after the invasion of Iraq, Perle stated that; &quot;in this case international law stood in the way of doing the right thing&quot;. He also argued that there was &quot;no practical mechanism consistent with the rules of the UN for dealing with Saddam Hussein&quot;. At the time, these comments provoked controversy among critics of the war, who argued that they contradicted the U.S.&#x27;s official stance on the legality of the invasion.

====Israel====

In 1996 during the Clinton administration, Perle led a study group with David Wurmser that produced a report on balancing power in the Middle East, specifically in Israel&#x27;s favor. The report, &quot;A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm&quot;, made clear recommendations about steering Israel away from socialist principles, making efforts to become more self-reliant, &quot;nurturing alternatives to Arafat&#x27;s exclusive grip on Palestinian society&quot;, and working more closely with countries such as Jordan and Turkey. It also stated the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq should be a key objective for the Israeli state, advocated armed incursions into Lebanon, and suggested Arab states should be challenged as undemocratic. Moreover, Perle personally delivered the report to the incoming Likud-led government in hopes of influencing the new Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

====Defense====

Perle advocates pre-emptive strikes, such as in Iraq, as an extension of America&#x27;s right to self-defense. For example, Perle has expressed support for a theoretical first strike on North Korean and Iranian nuclear facilities.

=== Business interests and controversies ===

==== Bribery accusations and alleged conflicts of interest ====

Perle has on occasion been accused of being an Israeli agent of influence. It has been reported that, while he was working for Jackson, &quot;An FBI summary of a 1970 wiretap recorded Perle discussing classified information with someone at the Israeli embassy. He came under fire in 1983 when newspapers reported he received substantial payments to represent the interests of an Israeli weapons company. Perle denied conflict of interest, insisting that, although he received payment for these services after he had assumed his position in the Defense Department, he was between government jobs when he worked for the Israeli firm.&quot;

From 1981 to 1987, Perle was Assistant Secretary of Defense for international security policy in the Reagan administration. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Perle was criticized for recommending that the Army purchase an armaments system from an Israeli company that a year earlier had paid him $50,000 in consulting fees. Perle acknowledged receiving the payment the same month he joined the Reagan administration, but said the payment was for work done before joining the government and that he had informed the Army of this prior consulting work. Perle was never indicted for anything related to the incident.

In March 2004, another &quot;New York Times&quot; article reported that, while chairman of the Defense Policy Board, Perle had contracted with the troubled telecommunications giant Global Crossing to help overcome opposition from the FBI and the Pentagon to the sale of its assets to Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa. Since the military employed the company&#x27;s fiber optics network for communications, the brass argued that sale to a foreign-owned, especially Chinese, corporation would compromise national security. Perle was to be paid $125,000 to promote the deal, with an extra $600,000 contingent fee on its approval. This controversy led to accusations of bribery, and Perle resigned as chairman on March 27, 2003, though he remained on the board.

Perle is also known to have demanded payment for press interviews while he was the chairman of the Defense Policy Board, a practice that has raised accusations of not only ethical but legal impropriety.

====Unresolved legal issues====
In 1978, while working with the Senate Armed Services Committee, Perle was caught in a security breach, by CIA director Stansfield Turner. Although Turner urged Senator Jackson to fire him, Perle received a warning and was kept on staff according to the &quot;Washington Post&quot;.

Perle has served as a Director of Hollinger International since June 1994. He is also co-chairman of Hollinger Digital Inc. and a Director of Jerusalem Post, both of which are subsidiaries of the company. He has served as a director of GeoBiotics. On August 31, 2004, a special committee of the Board of Directors investigating the alleged misconduct of the controlling shareholders of Hollinger International submitted the 512-page Breeden Report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the report, Perle is singled out as having breached his fiduciary responsibilities as a company director by authorizing several controversial transactions which diverted the company&#x27;s net profit from the shareholders to the accounts of various executives. Perle received over $3 million in bonuses on top of his salary, bringing the total to $5.4 million, and the investigating committee called for him to return the money.

Top Hollinger executives dismissed the report and have filed a defamation lawsuit against the head of the investigating committee, former SEC chairman Richard C. Breeden. However, in 2005, Perle publicly acknowledged he had been served a &#x27;Wells notice&#x27;, a formal warning that the S.E.C.&#x27;s enforcement staff had found sufficient evidence of wrongdoing to bring a civil lawsuit.

====Seymour Hersh and &quot;Lunch with the Chairman&quot;====
In July 2001, George W. Bush appointed Perle chairman of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, which advises the Department of Defense. Two years later a newspaper article accused Perle of a conflict of interest, claiming Perle stood to profit financially by influencing government policy. The article alleged that Perle had business dealings with Saudi investors and linked him to the intelligence-related computer firm Trireme Partners LLP, which he claimed stood to profit from the war in Iraq.

That same day, Perle was being interviewed on the issue of Iraq by CNN&#x27;s Wolf Blitzer. Shortly before the interview ended, Blitzer quoted the aforementioned news article and asked for Perle&#x27;s response. Perle dismissed the premise of the article and argued that it lacked &quot;any consistent theme&quot;. Added Perle: &quot;Sy Hersh is the closest thing American journalism has to a terrorist, frankly.&quot;

On March 11, Perle told the &quot;New York Sun&quot; as regards Hersh&#x27;s article that &quot;I intend to launch legal action in the United Kingdom. I&#x27;m talking to Queen&#x27;s Counsel right now&quot;. He claimed it was easier to win libel cases in England, and that therefore made it a better location. In the end, Perle did not file any legal case. Instead, on March 27, 2003, he resigned as chairman of the Defense Policy Board, although he still remained a member of the board. 

====Adviser to Muammar al-Gaddafi====
As a member of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based consulting firm Monitor Group, Perle was an advisor to Libyan dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi in 2006. &quot;Perle traveled to Libya twice in 2006 and met with Vice President Dick Cheney after the trips.&quot; According to Monitor documents, Perle traveled to Libya with several other advisers to hold lectures and workshops, and promote the image of Libya and its ruler.

====Iraq oil deal====
In July 2008, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Perle had made plans to invest in oil interests in Iraq, in collaboration with Iraqi Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq (Iraqi Kurdistan).

==Works==
Perle is author of many articles and three books:
* &quot;An End to Evil: How to Win the War on Terror&quot; (with David Frum, 2003) 
* &quot;Hard Line&quot; (1992) ()
* &quot;Reshaping Western Security&quot; (ed.) (1991) ()

In 1992 he produced the PBS feature &quot;The Gulf Crisis: The Road to War&quot;.

In 2007, Perle presented the documentary &quot;The Case for War: In Defense of Freedom&quot;, articulating his view of the challenges facing the U.S. after 9/11, and debating with his critics including Richard Holbrooke, Simon Jenkins, and Abdel Bari Atwan. The film was broadcast by PBS in their series &quot;America at a Crossroads&quot;, which generated considerable controversy.

<text>Princess Stéphanie Marie Elisabeth of Monaco (born 1 February 1965) is the youngest child of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and American actress Grace Kelly. She is the younger sister of Albert II, Prince of Monaco, and Caroline, Princess of Hanover. Currently 14th in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne, she has been a singer, swimwear designer and fashion model.

== Early life and education ==

Stéphanie was born to Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace on 1 February 1965 at Prince&#x27;s Palace in Monaco. She is the youngest of their three children. She has two older siblings, Caroline and Albert. Her godparents are her maternal uncle John B. Kelly Jr. and paternal first cousin Elisabeth-Anne de Massy. Her mother, who described Stephanie as a &quot;warm, bright, amusing, intelligent and capable girl&quot; and a &quot;good athlete&quot;, lovingly called her &quot;wild child&quot; (French: &quot;enfant terrible&quot;).

On 13 September 1982, while returning home from their farm in Rocagel, France, Stéphanie and her mother had a car accident. Grace died the next day, on 14 September, while Stéphanie sustained a hairline fracture of a neck vertebra. 

Although the official report of the incident was that Grace suffered a stroke while driving, rumors began that Stéphanie, who had to miss her mother&#x27;s funeral due to her recovery, was the one actually driving. Stéphanie herself refused to speak publicly about her mother&#x27;s death until 1989, when she gave an interview to the author Jeffrey Robinson, insisting that the story was untrue. She said, &quot;There was a lot of pressure on me because everyone was saying that I had been driving the car, that it was all my fault, that I&#x27;d killed my mother... It&#x27;s not easy when you&#x27;re 17 to live with that.&quot; 

She did not discuss the subject again until a 2002 interview with the French magazine &quot;Paris Match&quot; in which she repeated her earlier denial, and discussed the trauma of being beside her mother at the time of the accident. She said, &quot;Not only did I go through the horrible trauma of losing my mother at a very young age, but I was beside her at the moment of the accident. Nobody can imagine how much I&#x27;ve suffered, and still suffer.&quot;

Princess Stéphanie was educated at the Dames de Saint-Maur in Monaco, and then at the école and collège Dupanloup in Boulogne-Billancourt, France. Stéphanie earned her baccalauréat from the &quot;Cours Charles de Foucauld&quot; in 1982. During her school years, she studied classical dance and piano, and competed in gymnastics and horse riding. She also attended Camp Oneka, an all-girls&#x27; summer camp in the Pocono Mountains, in the United States, where her sister and mother both had previously attended.

== Career ==

=== Fashion ===
In 1983, after her physical recovery from the accident that killed her mother, Stéphanie started an apprentice programme at Christian Dior under the direction of head designer Marc Bohan. The following year, she debuted as a model on the biannual haute couture special published by Spanish magazine &quot;¡Hola!&quot;, a venture that she repeated in 1990. In 1985, Stéphanie appeared on the cover of German &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine and the American publication &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. She also became the spokesman of the Swiss beauty line La Prairie, for which she was photographed by Horst, and she appeared on the cover of French &quot;Vogue&quot;, photographed by Helmut Newton in September 1986.

In 1986, Stéphanie launched a swimwear line Pool Position with Alix de la Comble, whom she had met during her internship at Dior. The fashion show to present the line, held at the Sporting Club in Monaco and attended by her father, Prince Rainier, and siblings, Caroline and Albert, was a major event covered by the worldwide media. In 1989, Stéphanie launched her own self-titled perfume.

Stéphanie co-owns Replay cafes and stores in both Monaco and Barcelona. In December 2008, she was guest-editor of &quot;Vogue Paris&quot; and appeared on the magazine&#x27;s cover.

=== Musical career ===

In February 1986, Stéphanie self-produced and released her first single with the French label Carrere, under the production of Yves Roze. The song &quot;Ouragan&quot; and its English version &quot;Irresistible&quot; were both international hits, reportedly selling more than 2 million copies. The full album &quot;Besoin&quot;, released as &quot;Stéphanie&quot; in some countries, sold more than 1.5 million, with 100,000 in France. The single &quot;Flash&quot;, as well as its English version &quot;One Love to Give,&quot; also achieved success throughout Europe. In January 1987, Stéphanie released the single &quot;Young Ones Everywhere&quot; to benefit UNICEF.

The same year, Stéphanie moved to Los Angeles to record a new album. However, it took her five years to release it. The album &quot;Stéphanie&quot;, released in 1991, met with disappointing sales and negative reviews, despite the promotional tour that included a performance on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. Stéphanie then ended her music career after recording &quot;In the Closet&quot; with Michael Jackson for his album &quot;Dangerous&quot;. The song became a worldwide hit and reached the top 10 in the United States but Stéphanie was credited on the single under the alias &quot;Mystery Girl&quot; and her involvement in the song was not revealed until a few years later. She made a brief return to singing in 2006, when she recorded &quot;L&#x27;Or de nos vies&quot;, a charity single, along with her foundation Fight AIDS.

=== Philanthropy and patronages ===

Stéphanie is the president of several associations, including Monaco Youth Centre and Princess Stéphanie Activity Centre, and is an honorary board member of the Princess Grace Foundation – United States. She has also been the patron of the International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo, which she regularly attends, and the World Association of Children&#x27;s Friends (AMADE), which was founded in 1963 by her mother. Since 1985, Stéphanie has been the president of the Monte-Carlo Magic Grand Prix and the International Festival of Amateur Theatre. She is also the president of the Théâtre Princesse Grace.

In 2003, Stéphanie created her own Women Face the AIDS Association, which became Fight AIDS Monaco in 2004, in order to support people living with HIV and to combat the social stigma attached to the disease. Since 2006, Stéphanie has been a Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) ambassador. The same year, along with the group of singers, she released a charitable single &quot;L&#x27;Or de nos vies&quot;. On 26 June 2010, Stéphanie inaugurated, in the presence of Prince Albert, the House of Life (French: &quot;Maison de Vie&quot;) in Carpentras, Vaucluse, France, which offers both psychological and material aid to persons living with either HIV and AIDS and their families. Stéphanie has organised numerous events, such as auction sales, concerts and galas, to support her foundation.

== Personal life ==

Stéphanie dated Paul Belmondo, Anthony Delon, Rob Lowe, Mario Oliver Jutard, and the late Jean-Yves Le Fur (1964-2024) before she began a relationship with her bodyguard Daniel Ducruet in 1992.

The couple have two children, Louis and Pauline Ducruet, born in 1992 and 1994 respectively at Princess Grace Hospital Centre in Monaco. The children were included in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne when Stéphanie married Ducruet on 1 July 1995 at Monaco town hall. The couple divorced on 4 October 1996.

Stéphanie gave birth to her third child, Camille Gottlieb, on 15 July 1998 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre. Although she did not identify the father&#x27;s name on the birth certificate, many suspected that Camille&#x27;s father was her Head of Security Jean Raymond Gottlieb and Camille has acknowledged Gottlieb as her father. As her parents never married, Camille is not included in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne.
In 2001, Stéphanie began a relationship with married elephant trainer Franco Knie and moved, along with her three children, into Knie&#x27;s circus caravan. However, that relationship came to an end in 2002, and Stéphanie and her family returned to Monaco. On 12 September 2003, she married Portuguese acrobat Adans Lopez Peres, a member of Knie&#x27;s circus ensemble. The marriage ended in divorce on 24 November 2004.

Stéphanie is the godmother to Andrea Casiraghi, the eldest son of her sister Princess Caroline, and to Alexandre Grimaldi-Coste.

The most common interpretation of the song&#x27;s title involves a reference to the Misty Mountains in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. The lyrics refer to the events of 7 July 1968 &quot;Legalise Pot Rally&quot; in Hyde Park, London, in which police made arrests for marijuana possession. The lyrics reflect Plant&#x27;s quest for a better society, a place and time when hangups are replaced with individual freedom and a life of mutual support and rapport.

The song was recorded at Headley Grange, a mansion where the band sometimes lived in Hampshire, England.

==Personnel==
According to Jean-Michel Guesdon and Philippe Margotin:

* Robert Plant – vocals
* Jimmy Page – electric guitars
* John Paul Jones – bass, electric piano
* John Bonham – drums

==Releases and versions==
The song was released as the B-side to the single &quot;Black Dog&quot;, which was released in the United States on 2 December 1971, continental Europe (the United Kingdom did not receive the single release), and Australia.

A different version of this song is featured on the second disc of the remastered two CD deluxe edition of &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;.

==Live performances==
The band performed the song at the 3 May 1971 Copenhagen concert (song&#x27;s first concert performance) and then at the 1972 and 1973 concert tours. Band member Robert Plant performed it for most of his own solo concerts since the 1980 band breakup. Plant also performed it with the surviving members of the band at the 10 December 2007 tribute concert for Ahmet Ertegun.

<doc id="202579" wikidata="Q244266" url="?curid=202579" title="The Battle of Evermore">
<text>&quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; is a folk duet sung by Robert Plant and Sandy Denny, included on Led Zeppelin&#x27;s untitled 1971 album, commonly known as &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;. The song&#x27;s instrumentation features acoustic guitar and mandolin playing, while the lyrics allude to J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

==Writing and production==
===Writing===
The song was written by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant at Headley Grange while Page was experimenting on John Paul Jones&#x27;s mandolin. Page explained in 1977 that Battle of Evermore&#x27; was made up on the spot by Robert [Plant] and myself. I just picked up John Paul Jones&#x27;s mandolin, never having played a mandolin before, and just wrote up the chords and the whole thing in one sitting.&quot;

===Allusions to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;===
The song, like Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Ramble On&quot; and &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot;, makes references to J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, with &quot;The Dark Lord rides in force tonight and time will tell us all&quot; in line 4, &quot;The drums will shake the castle wall, the Ringwraiths ride in black&quot; in line 18, and mentions of war and swords (line 13), shooting with a bow (line 19), magic runes (line 20) and &quot;the dragon of darkness&quot; in line 24. &quot;The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot; states that the three songs make &quot;direct references to Gollum, Mordor, the Ringwraiths, and events described in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and &quot;[Lord of the Rings]&quot;&quot;. 

&quot;The Oxford Handbook of Music and Medievalism&quot; treats the song as &quot;fantasy medievalism&quot;, seeing allusions to multiple features of Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth. It notes that the song &quot;specifically alludes&quot; to the Dark Lord and the Ringwraiths, while the &quot;Queen of Light&quot; mentioned is &quot;possibly&quot; the elf-queen Galadriel. It states that the battle in the song &quot;has often been identified by fans&quot; as the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Describing the effect of the song, it writes that Plant makes use of the feeling of nostalgia with the &quot;strain and desperation&quot; in his &quot;vocal cries&quot; combined with the &quot;haunting, pastoral soundscape&quot; that together set up &quot;the destructive world of war in opposition to an idealized and Arcadian peaceful home&quot;.

===Sandy Denny===
Plant felt he needed another voice to tell the story, and for the recording of the song, singer Sandy Denny was invited to duet with Plant. Denny was a former member of British folk rock group Fairport Convention, with whom Led Zeppelin had shared a bill in 1970 at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music. Plant played the role of the narrator and Denny represented the town crier. Page elaborated that &quot;[The song] sounded like an old English instrumental first off. Then it became a vocal and Robert did his bit. Finally we figured we&#x27;d bring Sandy by and do a question-and-answer-type thing.&quot;

To thank her for her involvement, Denny was given the symbol on the album sleeve of three pyramids (the four members of Led Zeppelin each chose their own symbols for the album). This is the only song Led Zeppelin ever recorded with a guest vocalist. In an interview he gave in 1995 to &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine, Plant stated that &quot;[F]or me to sing with Sandy Denny was great. We were always good friends with that period of Fairport Convention. Richard Thompson is a superlative guitarist. Sandy and I were friends, and it was the most obvious thing to ask her to sing on &#x27;The Battle of Evermore&#x27;. If it suffered from naivete and tweeness—I was only 23—it makes up for it in the cohesion of the voices and the playing.&quot;

==Personnel==
According to Jean-Michel Guesdon and Philippe Margotin:

* Robert Plant – vocals
* Jimmy Page – mandolin, acoustic guitar
* John Paul Jones – mandolin (?), acoustic guitar (?)
* Sandy Denny – vocals

==Live performances==
&quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; was played live at Led Zeppelin concerts during the band&#x27;s 1977 North American Tour. For these live performances, Jones sang Denny&#x27;s vocals and played acoustic guitar whilst Page played mandolin. Sometimes John Bonham sang Denny&#x27;s vocals along with Jones. 
The British rock band Fairport Convention performed &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; with guest vocalists Plant and Kristina Donahue at Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention on 9 August 2008.
Plant and Alison Krauss regularly performed &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; on their tour of US and Europe in spring and summer 2008 in promotion of their 2007 collaboration album &quot;Raising Sand&quot;.

==Other versions==
An instrumental version of the song is featured on the companion audio CD on the remastered deluxe 2CD version of &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;, titled &quot;The Battle of Evermore (Mandolin/Guitar Mix From Headley Grange)&quot;, recorded on 29 January 1971, at the Rolling Stones Mobile at Headley Grange with engineer Andy Johns. It is much shorter than the original, with a running time of 4:13 rather than 5:51.

Page and Plant recorded a live version of the song in 1994, released on their album &quot;No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded&quot;. Najma Akhtar sang Denny&#x27;s vocal part.

<doc id="202584" wikidata="Q1120908" url="?curid=202584" title="Medical physics">
<text>Medical physics deals with the application of the concepts and methods of physics to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of human diseases with a specific goal of improving human health and well-being. Since 2008, medical physics has been included as a health profession according to International Standard Classification of Occupation of the International Labour Organization.

Although medical physics may sometimes also be referred to as &quot;biomedical physics&quot;, &quot;medical biophysics&quot;, &quot;applied physics in medicine&quot;, &quot;physics applications in medical science&quot;, &quot;radiological physics&quot; or &quot;hospital radio-physics&quot;, a &quot;medical physicist&quot; is specifically a health professional with specialist education and training in the concepts and techniques of applying physics in medicine and competent to practice independently in one or more of the subfields of medical physics. Traditionally, medical physicists are found in the following healthcare specialties: radiation oncology (also known as radiotherapy or radiation therapy), diagnostic and interventional radiology (also known as medical imaging), nuclear medicine, and radiation protection. Medical physics of radiation therapy can involve work such as dosimetry, linac quality assurance, and brachytherapy. Medical physics of diagnostic and interventional radiology involves medical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, computed tomography and x-ray. Nuclear medicine will include positron emission tomography and radionuclide therapy. However one can find Medical Physicists in many other areas such as physiological monitoring, audiology, neurology, neurophysiology, cardiology and others.

Medical physics departments may be found in institutions such as universities, hospitals, and laboratories. University departments are of two types. The first type are mainly concerned with preparing students for a career as a hospital Medical Physicist and research focuses on improving the practice of the profession. A second type (increasingly called &#x27;biomedical physics&#x27;) has a much wider scope and may include research in any applications of physics to medicine from the study of biomolecular structure to microscopy and nanomedicine.

==Mission statement of medical physicists==
In hospital medical physics departments, the mission statement for medical physicists as adopted by the European Federation of Organisations for Medical Physics (EFOMP) is the following:

The term &quot;physical agents&quot; refers to ionising and non-ionising electromagnetic radiations, static electric and magnetic fields, ultrasound, laser light and any other Physical Agent associated with medical e.g., x-rays in computerised tomography (CT), gamma rays/radionuclides in nuclear medicine, magnetic fields and radio-frequencies in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound in ultrasound imaging and Doppler measurements.

This mission includes the following 11 key activities:

#Scientific problem solving service: Comprehensive problem solving service involving recognition of less than optimal performance or optimised use of medical devices, identification and elimination of possible causes or misuse, and confirmation that proposed solutions have restored device performance and use to acceptable status. All activities are to be based on current best scientific evidence or own research when the available evidence is not sufficient.
#Dosimetry measurements: Measurement of doses had by patients, volunteers in biomedical research, carers, comforters and persons subjected to non-medical imaging exposures (e.g., for legal or employment purposes); selection, calibration and maintenance of dosimetry related instrumentation; independent checking of dose related quantities provided by dose reporting devices (including software devices); measurement of dose related quantities required as inputs to dose reporting or estimating devices (including software). Measurements to be based on current recommended techniques and protocols. Includes dosimetry of all physical agents.
#Patient safety/risk management (including volunteers in biomedical research, carers, comforters and persons subjected to non-medical imaging exposures. Surveillance of medical devices and evaluation of clinical protocols to ensure the ongoing protection of patients, volunteers in biomedical research, carers, comforters and persons subjected to non-medical imaging exposures from the deleterious effects of physical agents in accordance with the latest published evidence or own research when the available evidence is not sufficient. Includes the development of risk assessment protocols.
#Occupational and public safety/risk management (when there is an impact on medical exposure or own safety). Surveillance of medical devices and evaluation of clinical protocols with respect to protection of workers and public when impacting the exposure of patients, volunteers in biomedical research, carers, comforters and persons subjected to non-medical imaging exposures or responsibility with respect to own safety. Includes the development of risk assessment protocols in conjunction with other experts involved in occupational / public risks.
#Clinical medical device management: Specification, selection, acceptance testing, commissioning and quality assurance/ control of medical devices in accordance with the latest published European or International recommendations and the management and supervision of associated programmes. Testing to be based on current recommended techniques and protocols.
#Clinical involvement: Carrying out, participating in and supervising everyday radiation protection and quality control procedures to ensure ongoing effective and optimised use of medical radiological devices and including patient specific optimization.
#Development of service quality and cost-effectiveness: Leading the introduction of new medical radiological devices into clinical service, the introduction of new medical physics services and participating in the introduction/development of clinical protocols/techniques whilst giving due attention to economic issues.
#Expert consultancy: Provision of expert advice to outside clients (e.g., clinics with no in-house medical physics expertise).
#Education of healthcare professionals (including medical physics trainees: Contributing to quality healthcare professional education through knowledge transfer activities concerning the technical-scientific knowledge, skills and competences supporting the clinically effective, safe, evidence-based and economical use of medical radiological devices. Participation in the education of medical physics students and organisation of medical physics residency programmes.
#Health technology assessment (HTA): Taking responsibility for the physics component of health technology assessments related to medical radiological devices and /or the medical uses of radioactive substances/sources.
#Innovation: Developing new or modifying existing devices (including software) and protocols for the solution of hitherto unresolved clinical problems.

==Medical biophysics and biomedical physics==
Some education institutions house departments or programs bearing the title &quot;medical biophysics&quot; or &quot;biomedical physics&quot; or &quot;applied physics in medicine&quot;. Generally, these fall into one of two categories: interdisciplinary departments that house biophysics, radiobiology, and medical physics under a single umbrella; and undergraduate programs that prepare students for further study in medical physics, biophysics, or medicine.
Most of the scientific concepts in bionanotechnology are derived from other fields. Biochemical principles that are used to understand the material properties of biological systems are central in bionanotechnology because those same principles are to be used to create new technologies. Material properties and applications studied in bionanoscience include mechanical properties (e.g. deformation, adhesion, failure), electrical/electronic (e.g. electromechanical stimulation, capacitors, energy storage/batteries), optical (e.g. absorption, luminescence, photochemistry), thermal (e.g. thermomutability, thermal management), biological (e.g. how cells interact with nanomaterials, molecular flaws/defects, biosensing, biological mechanisms such as mechanosensation), nanoscience of disease (e.g. genetic disease, cancer, organ/tissue failure), as well as computing (e.g. DNA computing) and agriculture (target delivery of pesticides, hormones and fertilizers.

==Areas of specialty==
The International Organization for Medical Physics (IOMP) recognizes main areas of medical physics employment and focus.

===Medical imaging physics===
Medical imaging physics is also known as diagnostic and interventional radiology physics.
Clinical (both &quot;in-house&quot; and &quot;consulting&quot;) physicists typically deal with areas of testing, optimization, and quality assurance of diagnostic radiology physics areas such as radiographic X-rays, fluoroscopy, mammography, angiography, and computed tomography, as well as non-ionizing radiation modalities such as ultrasound, and MRI. They may also be engaged with radiation protection issues such as dosimetry (for staff and patients). In addition, many imaging physicists are often also involved with nuclear medicine systems, including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET).
Sometimes, imaging physicists may be engaged in clinical areas, but for research and teaching purposes, such as quantifying intravascular ultrasound as a possible method of imaging a particular vascular object.

=== Radiation therapeutic physics===
Radiation therapeutic physics is also known as radiotherapy physics or radiation oncologist physics.
The majority of medical physicists currently working in the US, Canada, and some western countries are of this group. A radiation therapy physicist typically deals with linear accelerator (Linac) systems and kilovoltage x-ray treatment units on a daily basis, as well as other modalities such as TomoTherapy, gamma knife, Cyberknife, proton therapy, and brachytherapy.
The academic and research side of therapeutic physics may encompass fields such as boron neutron capture therapy, sealed source radiotherapy, terahertz radiation, high-intensity focused ultrasound (including lithotripsy), optical radiation lasers, ultraviolet etc. including photodynamic therapy, as well as nuclear medicine including unsealed source radiotherapy, and photomedicine, which is the use of light to treat and diagnose disease.

===Nuclear medicine physics===
Nuclear medicine is a branch of medicine that uses radiation to provide information about the functioning of a person&#x27;s specific organs or to treat disease. The thyroid, bones, heart, liver and many other organs can be easily imaged, and disorders in their function revealed. In some cases radiation sources can be used to treat diseased organs, or tumours. Five Nobel laureates have been intimately involved with the use of radioactive tracers in medicine.
Over 10,000 hospitals worldwide use radioisotopes in medicine, and about 90% of the procedures are for diagnosis. The most common radioisotope used in diagnosis is technetium-99m, with some 30 million procedures per year, accounting for 80% of all nuclear medicine procedures worldwide.

===Health physics===
Health physics is also known as radiation safety or radiation protection. Health physics is the applied physics of radiation protection for health and health care purposes. It is the science concerned with the recognition, evaluation, and control of health hazards to permit the safe use and application of ionizing radiation. Health physics professionals promote excellence in the science and practice of radiation protection and safety.

* Radiation protection
* Dosimetry
* Health physics
* Radiological protection of patients

===Non-ionizing Medical Radiation Physics===
Some aspects of non-ionising radiation physics may be considered under radiation protection or diagnostic imaging physics. Imaging modalities include MRI, optical imaging and ultrasound. Safety considerations include these areas and lasers
* Lasers and applications in medicine

===Physiological measurement===
Physiological measurements have also been used to monitor and measure various physiological parameters. Many physiological measurement techniques are non-invasive and can be used in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, other invasive methods. Measurement methods include electrocardiography Many of these areas may be covered by other specialities, for example medical engineering or vascular science.

===Healthcare informatics and computational physics===
Other closely related fields to medical physics include fields which deal with medical data, information technology and computer science for medicine.
* Information and communication in medicine
* Medical informatics
* Image processing, display and visualization
* Computer-aided diagnosis
* Picture archiving and communication systems (PACS)
* Standards: DICOM, ISO, IHE
* Hospital information systems
* e-Health
* Telemedicine
* Digital operating room
* Workflow, patient-specific modeling
* Medicine on the Internet of Things 
* Distant monitoring and telehomecare

===Areas of research and academic development===

Non-clinical physicists may or may not focus on the above areas from an academic and research point of view, but their scope of specialization may also encompass lasers and ultraviolet systems (such as photodynamic therapy), fMRI and other methods for functional imaging as well as molecular imaging, electrical impedance tomography, diffuse optical imaging, optical coherence tomography, and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.

<text>Bamberg () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It surrounds but does not include the town of Bamberg. The district is bounded by the districts of (from the north and clockwise) Lichtenfels, Bayreuth, Forchheim, Erlangen-Höchstadt, Neustadt (Aisch)-Bad Windsheim, Kitzingen, Schweinfurt and Haßberge.

== History ==
The history of the district is linked with the history of Bamberg.

In 1862 the districts of Bamberg-West and Bamberg-East were established. They were merged in 1929. The present borders were established in 1972, when portions of the adjoining district of Erlangen-Höchstadt were annexed.

== Geography ==
The district surrounds the town of Bamberg. The western half of the district is occupied by the Steigerwald, a hilly forest region. In the east there is the hill chain of the Franconian Jura. Between these regions the Main river enters the district from the north, turns around just before the town of Bamberg and leaves to the northwest. The smaller Regnitz river comes from the south and flows into the Main at Bamberg.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays the heraldic animals of Bamberg and Ebrach, a lion and a boar.

<doc id="202590" wikidata="Q1700222" url="?curid=202590" title="John Gillespie Magee Jr.">
<text>John Gillespie Magee Jr. (9 June 1922 – 11 December 1941) was a World War II Anglo-American Royal Canadian Air Force fighter pilot and war poet, who wrote the sonnet &quot;High Flight&quot;. He was killed in an accidental mid-air collision over England in 1941.

== Early life ==
John Gillespie Magee was born in Shanghai, China, to an American father and a British mother, who both worked as Anglican missionaries. His father, John Magee Sr., was from a family of some wealth and influence in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Magee Senior chose to become an Episcopal priest and was sent as a missionary to China. Whilst there he met his future wife, Faith Emmeline Backhouse, who came from Helmingham in Suffolk and was a member of the Church Missionary Society. Magee&#x27;s parents married in 1921, and their first child, John Junior, was born 9 June 1922, the eldest of four brothers.

Magee began his education at the American School in Nanking in 1929. In 1931, he moved with his mother to England and spent the following four years at St Clare, a preparatory school for boys, in Walmer, in the county of Kent. From 1935 to 1939, he attended Rugby School, where he developed the ambition to become a poet, and whilst at the school won its Poetry Prize in 1938. He was impressed by the school&#x27;s Roll of Honour listing its pupils who had fallen in the First World War, which included the Edwardian poet Rupert Brooke (1887–1915), whose writing style Magee emulated. Brooke had won the school&#x27;s Poetry Prize 34 years prior to Magee. The prize-winning poem by Magee centred upon the burial of Brooke&#x27;s body at 11 o&#x27;clock at night in an olive grove on the Greek island of Skyros in April 1915.

Whilst at Rugby, Magee fell in love with Elinor Lyon, the daughter of P. H. B. Lyon, the headmaster. In later life, an accomplished children&#x27;s author, she became the inspiration for many of Magee&#x27;s poems. Though his love was not returned, he remained friends with Elinor and her family.

Magee visited the United States in 1939, staying with his mother and brothers in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. He also visited relatives of his father in Pittsburgh, part of a very wealthy extended family which included the Mellons. One of these relatives was his uncle, Pittsburgh lawyer and Congressman James McDevitt Magee, who had served as a first lieutenant in the United States Army Air Service during the First World War. During Magee&#x27;s stay in Pittsburgh, he participated to the full in the social life available to him there, including the Rolling Rock Club. His expenditures on these activities attracted critical correspondence from his clergyman father.

Because of the outbreak of World War II, Magee was unable to travel to Britain for his final school year (1939–1940) at Rugby, and instead attended Avon Old Farms School in Avon, Connecticut. The school &quot;Provost&quot;, or headmaster, Rev. W. Brooke Stabler, later recalled an incident during the winter of 1939–1940, when, after a school dance:

Magee climbed a tall tree to rescue a cat; before he had come down out of the tree, there was a circle of admiring and exclaiming girls watching him from the ground . . . 
His attitude toward the war gradually evolved from one approaching pacifism to a decision to become a pilot to help protect his friends in Britain. Stabler recalled:

One afternoon, after lying on top of a tower [at the School] for a couple of hours in the sun, Magee turned to his companion and suddenly announced, “Well, I think I’ll join the R.A.F.” 

He once again stayed with his family in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard in the summer of 1940, learning to drive and having a very active social life:
Mornings on the beach, surrounded by a bevy of girls . . . dances . . . beach parties . . . occasionally a drop too much of alcohol . . . wild drives around the bay to Vineyard Haven and Edgartown . . . . . and grave discussions with his father on the state of the world or some phase of Christian living. When his father remonstrated with him once on turning night into day, John answered, &quot;My generation does not expect to live long, and we want to enjoy ourselves while we may.&quot; 

After discussions with his parents, he decided to go to Canada to join the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), with the intention of learning to fly, and then being sent to Britain. Accordingly, while he had been offered a scholarship to Yale University for 1940–1941, he did not enroll.

==World War II==
Magee joined the R.C.A.F. in October 1940 and received flight training in Ontario at No.9 Elementary Flying Training School, located at RCAF Station St. Catharines (St. Catharines), and at No. 2 Service Flying Training School at RCAF Station Uplands (Ottawa). He soloed at St. Catharines after six hours&#x27; dual instruction, when the average was 10 or 11. He passed his Wings Test in Ottawa in June 1941.

Shortly after his promotion to the rank of pilot officer, after having been awarded his wings, Magee was sent to the United Kingdom, where on arrival he was posted to No. 53 Operational Training Unit at RAF Llandow near Cardiff. His first flight in a Spitfire occurred on 7 August 1941. On 18 August, while still stationed at Llandow, he flew a Spitfire to 33,000 feet, by far his highest flight to that date. This is the flight usually accepted as having inspired his poem.

After completing his training with No. 53 Operational Training Unit he was assigned to No. 412 (Fighter) Squadron, R.C.A.F., a Canadian unit formed at RAF Digby on 30 June 1941. No. 412 Squadron was part of the &quot;Digby Wing&quot;, commanded by the legendary &quot;Cowboy&quot; Blatchford. One of the other pilots serving at Digby that September was Flight Lieutenant &quot;Hart&quot; Massey, the son of Vincent Massey, the first Canadian-born Governor General of Canada.

Magee arrived at Digby on 23 September 1941, where he continued to train on the Spitfire. When Magee joined No.412 Squadron it was flying the Supermarine Spitfire Mk II; the squadron switched to the more powerful Mk Vb shortly after his arrival. He first took a Mk Vb aloft on 8 October 1941. On 20 October 1941, he took part in a convoy patrol, and on that same day the Squadron moved from the Digby Aerodrome to the nearby RAF Wellingore in Lincolnshire, a satellite station of Digby.

===Raid on Lille===
On 8 November 1941, he took part in a sortie to Occupied France escorting bombers attacking railway workshops at Lille. Twelve aeroplanes from No. 412 Squadron flew from Wellingore to RAF West Malling to refuel, and then headed out over the English Channel near RAF Manston. They crossed the hostile coast east of Dunkirk, encountering flak, after which they were attacked by Luftwaffe fighters. Of Magee&#x27;s four-ship section that entered the engagement, only he survived; all the others (including No. 412&#x27;s acting-squadron leader) were shot down and killed in action by the leading German ace Joachim Müncheberg. In the course of the engagement Magee fired 160 rounds of .303 ammunition, but made no claim for the infliction of damage to the enemy on returning to base in England. This was Magee&#x27;s lone engagement with the Luftwaffe during the war.

In late November – early December 1941 Magee took part in three more convoy patrols.

===Death===

On 11 December 1941, in his tenth week of active service, Magee was killed while flying Spitfire VZ-H (Serial No. AD291, the same aircraft he had flown in the engagement with the Luftwaffe over France four weeks earlier). He had taken off in the late morning with other members of No. 412 Squadron from RAF Wellingore (the airfield post-war has now reverted to agriculture) to practise air fighting tactics. During the performance, Magee&#x27;s aircraft was involved in a mid-air collision with an Airspeed Oxford trainer (Serial No.T1052) flying out of RAF Cranwell, piloted by 19-year-old Leading Aircraftman/Pilot Under-Training Ernest Aubrey Griffin. The two aircraft collided just below the cloud base at about 1,400 feet AGL, at 11:30, over the hamlet of Roxholme, which lies between RAF Cranwell and RAF Digby, in Lincolnshire. Magee was descending at high speed through a break in the clouds in concert with three other Spitfires when his struck the Airspeed Oxford.

At the inquiry afterwards a local farmer who witnessed the accident testified that he saw Magee after the collision struggling to push back the canopy of his Spitfire as it descended apparently out of control. Magee succeeded in opening the canopy and bailing out of the aeroplane, but was at too low an altitude for his parachute to have time to open, and he fell to earth and was killed instantly on impact with the ground in farmland near the village of Ruskington. He was 19 years of age. Leading Aircraftman/Pilot Under-Training Griffin, the other pilot involved in the mid-air collision, was also killed in the incident.
Magee&#x27;s body was buried in the graveyard of Holy Cross Church in the village of Scopwick in Lincolnshire. On the gravestone are inscribed the first and last lines from his poem &quot;High Flight&quot;. Part of the official letter to his parents read, &quot;Your son&#x27;s funeral took place at Scopwick Cemetery, near Digby Aerodrome, at 2.30 pm, on Saturday, 13 December 1941, the service being conducted by Flight Lieutenant S. K. Belton, the Canadian padre of this Station. He was accorded full Service Honours, the coffin being carried by pilots of his own Squadron&quot;.

== &quot;High Flight&quot; ==

Magee&#x27;s posthumous fame rests mainly on his sonnet &quot;High Flight&quot;, which he began writing on 18 August 1941 (a few months before his death) while stationed at No. 53 OTU at RAF Llandow in Wales. The poem was inspired by high-altitude training sessions with his squadron. Magee enclosed the poem in a letter to his parents, dated 3 September 1941. His father, then curate of Saint John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., reprinted it in church publications. The poem became more widely known through the efforts of Archibald MacLeish, then Librarian of Congress, who included it in an exhibition of poems called &quot;Faith and Freedom&quot; at the Library of Congress in February 1942. The manuscript copy of the poem remains at the Library of Congress.

=== Cultural significance ===
During April and May 1942, many Hollywood stars including Laurel and Hardy, Groucho Marx, Cary Grant, Bing Crosby, and Bob Hope joined the Hollywood Victory Caravan as it toured the United States on a mission to raise war bonds. Actress Merle Oberon recited &quot;High Flight&quot; as part of this show. During the performance on 30 April 1942, at the Loew&#x27;s Capitol Theatre in Washington, D.C., and before her recitation of the poem, Oberon acknowledged the attendance of Magee&#x27;s father, John Magee, and brother Christopher Magee.

Owing to its cheerful description of flying and its symbolic descriptions of transcending Earth, &quot;High Flight&quot; is beloved by many aviators and astronauts. It is the official poem of the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Royal Air Force and has to be recited from memory by fourth class cadets at the United States Air Force Academy, where it can be seen on display in the Cadet Field House. Portions of the poem appear on many of the headstones in the Arlington National Cemetery, and it is inscribed in full on the back of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; Memorial. It is displayed on panels at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, the National Air Force Museum of Canada, in Trenton, Ontario. It is the subject of a permanent display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, in Dayton, Ohio.

== &quot;Per Ardua&quot; ==
Shortly after Magee&#x27;s first combat action on 8 November 1941, he sent his family part of another poem, referring to it as &quot;another trifle which may interest you&quot;. It is possible that the poem, &quot;Per Ardua&quot;, is the last that Magee wrote. There are several corrections to the poem, made by Magee, which suggest that the poem was not completed when he sent it. &quot;Per ardua ad astra&quot; (&quot;Through adversity to the stars&quot;) is the motto of a number of Commonwealth air forces, such as the Royal Air Force, RAAF, RNZAF and the RCAF. It was first used in 1912 by the newly formed Royal Flying Corps.

<text>The Type I [[U-boat]] was the first post–World War I attempt to produce an oceangoing submarine for Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. The type was based on the Spanish Type E-1 and Finnish CV707, which were both designed by Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw. Only two Type IAs were built. They were not a successful design : due to its single rudder they had a large turning circle and were not very manoeuvrable. The gravity center of the U-boat was too forward so on the surface the type I had its propellers exposed when she was pitching. Whilst submerged there were problems with depth keeping and stability as air bubbles in the fuel tanks wobbled back and forth. Diving was very slow: at full speed and with six tons of negative buoyancy it took forty seconds to reach ten metres depth. As a result, the type was discontinued and the new type IX class of ocean-going U-boats was designed.

==Service history==
Constructed by Deschimag in Bremen, the first Type IA was launched on 14 February 1936. The two boats produced, and , were primarily used as training vessels and for propaganda purposes to fly the Nazi flag. In 1940, the boats were called into combat duty due to the shortage of available submarines. Both boats experienced short, but successful combat careers. &quot;U-25&quot; participated in five war cruises, sinking eight enemy ships. On 3 August 1940, while on a mine laying mission near Norway, &quot;U-25&quot; struck a mine and sank with all hands on board.

&quot;U-26&quot; carried out eight war cruises, sinking three merchant ships on its first mission laying mines. On its second war cruise it became the first U-boat during World War II to enter the Mediterranean Sea. &quot;U-26&quot; participated in three other successful war patrols, sinking four additional merchant ships. On its eighth war cruise the boat sank three merchant ships and damaged another ship the next day. The attack on this ship led to severe depth-charging by two British warships, including . Unable to dive, &quot;U-26&quot; was forced to surface where she was bombed by a Sunderland flying boat. The crew scuttled the submarine and were rescued by Allied warships.

Nellis hosts air combat exercises such as Exercise Red Flag and close air support exercises such as Green Flag-West flown in &quot;Military Operations Area (MOA) airspace&quot;, associated with the nearby Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR). The base also has the Combined Air and Space Operations Center-Nellis.

==History==

After World War I, Nevada and other western inland states were surveyed by Capt. Lowell H. Smith and Sgt. William B. Whitefield for landing sites, and by &quot;mid-1925 the Air Service possessed information on nearly thirty-five hundred landing places, including more than twenty-eight hundred emergency landing areas, in the United States.&quot; The 1929 airfield (dirt runway, water well, and small operations shack) north of Las Vegas—operated by the 1925 Western Air Express for Contract Air Mail (CAM) Route #4, LA-to-SLC—was used by the Army Air Corps in the 1930s for training flights. After the Invasion of Poland in 1939, the &quot;western site board&quot; had located a southern Nevada area &quot;near Tonopah, Nev&quot; by April 1940 for a military range, and in October 1940, Air Corps Major David Schlatter surveyed the southwest United States for a military airfield. &quot;The 60 × 90 mile area at Tonopah was transferred to the War Department on 29 October 1940&quot; by Executive Order 8578.

===McCarran Field===

Renamed to McCarran Field in the mid-1930s, there were &quot;difficulties in securing the use&quot; of the airfield north of Las Vegas for a Nevada World War II Army Airfield. McCarran Field was bought on 2 January 1941 by the City of Las Vegas, was leased to the Army on 5 January, and was &quot;signed over&quot; to the Quartermaster Corps on 25 January—Army construction began in March 1941. The city&#x27;s Federal Building became the May 1941 location of the 79th Air Base Group detachment (5 staff officers commanded by Lt. Col. Martinus Stenseth), and a month later 5 administrative NCOs plus other support personnel arrived. WPA barracks in Las Vegas were used for enlisted men, and the motor pool with 6 vintage trucks and a semi-trailer was next to the WPA barracks. Vehicle parts were from local service stations and gasoline and oil from the Civilian Conservation Corps (the Block 16 brothels in Las Vegas were closed). Permanent construction for barracks to house 3,000 people began in mid-1941, and by 7 December, 10 AT-6 Texan advanced flight trainers and 17 Martin B-10 bombers were at the airfield.

===Las Vegas Army Airfield===

Las Vegas Army Airfield was both activated and began flying training on 20 December 1941. Gunnery training began in January 1942, with guntruck platforms being used in January and February.. Many pieces of the destroyed aerial drone targets litter the hillside north of the gunnery range, and can be seen in town when the sun reflects off them.

The first B-17 Flying Fortresses arrived in 1942 and allowed training of 600 gunnery students and 215 co-pilots from the field every five weeks at the height of the war. More than 45,000 B-17 gunners were trained; the USAAF training movie &quot;The Rear Gunner&quot; was filmed at the airfield in 1943. The 82d Flying Training Wing (Flexible Gunnery) was activated at the base as one of ten Army Air Forces Flying Training Command wings on 23 August 1943. By 1944, gunnery students utilized B-17, B-24 Liberator and B-40 Flying Fortress gunship aircraft (for example by firing at aircraft-towed targets).

In March 1945, the base switched to B-29 gunnery training which included the manipulation trainer on the ground with camera guns. The subsequent population peaked with nearly 11,000 officers and enlisted personnel including more than 4,700 students. Flexible gunnery training ended in September 1945, and the base became a demobilization center for soldiers&#x27; separation physicals and final pay. A course of navigator, bombardier, and radar operator training planned for LVAAF was instead begun at Mather Army Airfield in June 1946. AAF Training Command closed LVAAF which went on caretaker status 28 August 1946 (&quot;officially deactivated in January 1947&quot;). During the planning for a separate air force, the Las Vegas AAF was reactivated &quot;30 Aug 47 as a subinstallation of Mather&quot;, and it transferred to the USAF after the branch was created in September.

===Las Vegas Air Force Base===
Renamed Las Vegas Air Force Base on 13 January 1948 and assigned as a subinstallation of Williams AFB on 1 April, the 3595th Pilot Training Wing (Advanced Single-Engine) was established on 22 December 1948. Training began at Las Vegas AFB on 1 March 1949 with 5 squadrons using P-51 Mustangs for a 6-month course, with 3,000 USAF pilots trained by 1950. The 3525th Aircraft Gunnery Squadron activated on 11 February 1949, the base hosted the 1st USAF Gunnery Meet on 2 May, and ATC (air traffic control) opened its LVAFB Aircraft Gunnery School on 15 May 1949.

===Nellis AFB===

Nellis Air Force Base was named on 30 April 1950, and the 20 May 1950 dedication was attended by Lieutenant Nellis&#x27; family. By 1 July the Air Force had directed ATC to accelerate Korean War training for a new 95-wing Air Force. The first school opened at Nellis, and ATC redesignated the 3595th Pilot Training Wing (Advanced Single-Engine) as the 3595th Training Wing (Combat Crew). On 17 July 1950, Nellis began a replacement pilot training program to provide 115 FEAF F-51 Mustang pilots and 92 combat-ready F-80 Shooting Star pilots. Nellis&#x27; advanced single-engine pilot training transferred to Alabama on 1 September 1950. Nellis assumed fighter-bomber training, and ATC established its USAF Air Crew School (Fighter) on 14 November 1950, equipped with F-80s and early-model F-84C Thunderjets. On 1 October, Nellis AFB base management functions transferred from Williams AFB. In early 1951, ATC assigned recently graduated airplane and engine mechanics to Nellis to learn jet aircraft maintenance. The airfield was expanded 1951–1954 with longer jet-capable runways, reconfigured taxiways and a larger aircraft parking ramp; and World War II wooden structures were replaced with concrete and steel structures (e.g., barracks and base housing for married personnel). The first Wherry houses were completed in 1954, with updated Capehart houses being completed in February 1960.

====USAF Fighter Weapons School====
The USAF Fighter Weapons School was designated on 1 January 1954 from the squadron when the Air Crew School graduated its last Combat Crew Training Class (the primary Weapons School mission was gunnery instructor training). In the mid-1950s for Operation Teapot nuclear testing, 1 of the 12 Zone Commanders was based at Nellis AFB for community liaison/public relations (weapons for other atomic tests were stored at Nellis). Air Training Command suspended training at the Nellis fighter weapons school in late 1956 because of the almost total failure of the F-86 Sabre aircraft used at Nellis, and during 1958 ATC discontinued its Flying Training and Technical Training.

====Tactical Air Command====
Nellis AFB transferred to Tactical Air Command on 1 February 1958, and the Nellis mission transitioned from initial aircraft qualification and gunnery training to advanced, graduate-level weapons training. Soon after the transfer to TAC, the F-100C, F-100D, and tandem cockpit F-100F entered the school inventory. On 21 April 1958 an F-100F on a training flight out of Nellis was involved in a mid-air collision with United Airlines Flight 736. All 47 aboard the airliner and both Air Force pilots in the fighter jet were killed. The 3595th wing assets were redesignated as the 4520th Combat Crew Training Group by TAC on 1 July 1958.

=====4520th Combat Crew Training Wing=====
The 4520th Combat Crew Training Wing was designated from the 4520th CCTG on 1 May 1961, and the Combat Crew training squadrons were renumbered. The 4537th Fighter Weapons Squadron had been assigned F-105D Thunderchiefs in March 1961, and the wing taught veteran pilots in all phases of fighter weapon employment: air-to-air gunnery, rocketry, conventional and nuclear bombing, aerial refueling, and combat navigation. The F-4 Phantom II Instructor Course began in mid-1965 and during the Vietnam War, experienced combat pilots were used as Fighter Weapons instructors at Nellis. On 1 January 1966 the USAF Fighter Weapons School was activated at Nellis with F-100, F-4, and F-105 divisions and on 1 September 1966, Fighter Weapons School elements and the 4520th CCTW merged to activate the 4525th Fighter Weapons Wing.

=====USAF Tactical Fighter Weapons Center=====
The USAF Tactical Fighter Weapons Center activated at Nellis AFB on 1 January 1966 (USAF Warfare Center after 15 November 2005) is the USAF authority for employment of tactical fighter weapons. The center has developed, refined, coordinated, validated and tested fighter concepts, doctrine, tactics, and procedures. The FWC also performed operational test and evaluation and prepared or monitored Air Force publications on employment tactics, aircrew training, and aircrew weapons delivery. It has supervised courses of the US Air Force Fighter Weapons School, adversary tactics training, and Wild Weasel training, and other combat and tactical schools.

The FWC supervised Red Flag operational training and other continuing air exercises, such as Green Flag and Silver Flag Alpha. The center also directed operations of the US Air Force Bomber and Tanker, Employment School since 1992 and the Air Rescue Center since 1993. The USAF Air Demonstration Squadron with the United States Air Force Thunderbirds moved from Arizona to Nellis AFB in June 1956.

=====474th Tactical Fighter Wing=====
The 474th Tactical Fighter Wing was reassigned from New Mexico to Nellis AFB on 20 January 1968 and was the first USAF operational wing equipped with the General Dynamics F-111—6 of the F-111As departed Nellis for Vietnam on 15 March 1968 (Combat Lancer). Nellis provided replacements for 2 lost F-111s, and the F-111s returned to the USA in November 1968. The wing&#x27;s 428th Tactical Fighter Squadron reached IOC in spring 1968 with F-111s, and the TFW was fully operational in July 1971. The Lake Mead Base, a 1953–6 United States Navy&#x27;s weapons storage area of , became Area II of the Nellis AFB complex in September 1969.

The 430th TFS returned to the 474th TFW Nellis on 22 March 1973 assuming a replacement training unit mission, while the 428th and 429th were transferred to Mountain Home AFB on 30 July 1973. Post-war the 474th&#x27;s mission was to train combat-ready force of aircrews and maintained a rapid-reaction capability to execute fighter attacks against enemy forces and facilities in time of crisis. In 1975, the 428th and 429th Tactical Fighter Squadrons were reassigned to the wing with F-111As (transferred to Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, in August 1977) and the 474th Wing absorbed the F-4D Phantom II aircraft, crews, and resources of the inactivating provisional 474th Tactical Fighter Wing at Nellis in April 1977. The wing was inactivated in September 1989, and its F-16As transferred to Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve squadrons.

=====57th Fighter Weapons Wing=====
The 57th Fighter Weapons Wing was activated at Nellis on 15 October 1969 to replace the 4525th FWW (its Fighter Weapons Squadrons transferred to the 57th). The USAF Air Demonstration Squadron (the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;) was assigned to the 57th in February 1974, and the wing incorporated intelligence training after March 1980. Redesignated the 57th Tactical Training Wing in 1977, the wing trained tactical fighter aircrews, conducted operational tests and evaluations, demonstrated tactical fighter weapon systems, and developed fighter tactics. The 57th&#x27;s 4440th Tactical Fighter Training Group (Red Flag) assumed operational control of Red Flag exercises in October 1979; and the 57th developing realistic combat training operations featuring adversary tactics, dissimilar air combat training, and electronic warfare.

Nellis&#x27; 4477th Tactical Evaluation Flight (&quot;Red Eagles&quot;) operated MiG-17s, MiG-21s and MiG-23s at the Tonopah Test Range Airport (late 1960s-) to simulate combat against U.S. combat aircraft. Named Constant Peg in 1980, the operation assessed the Soviet technology and developed adversary tactics for dissimilar air combat training. After completion of training, the Aggressor pilots were assigned to the DACT squadrons, one of which was assigned to Nellis. During the 1970s, a site northwest of Nellis evaluated a Soviet &quot;Barlock&quot; search radar to develop techniques for countering Soviet air defense systems.

The USAF Fighter Weapons School reactivated 30 December 1981 in the 57th wing and the 66th, 414th and 433d Fighter Weapons Squadrons became its &quot;A-10&quot;, &quot;F-4E&quot; and &quot;F-15A&quot; divisions (the 414th was the &quot;Red Flag Training Squadron&quot; in 1996). The 422d FWS aircraft and personnel became the &quot;F-16 Division&quot; and the squadron heraldry transferred to the 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron. The FWS mission expanded on 15 June 1993 to include all Air Combat Command weapons (B-52 &amp; B-1 Divisions) and in 1995, rescue helicopters (HH-60 Division). RC-135 Rivet Joint and EC-130 Compass Call courses were also added to the CCO Division in 1995, as well as a Space Division in 1996 (UAVs in 2008).

In 1981, the Gunsmoke gunnery meet was first held and the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing was reorganized as part of the establishment of the Fighter Weapons School, e.g., the 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron for aircraft modifications was established on 30 December 1981 from the 422d Fighter Weapons Squadron. In 1990, the 64th and 65th Tactical Fighter Training Aggressor Squadrons and the 4440th TFTG were inactivated in 1990 at the end of the Cold War. In November 1991, the 57th implemented the USAF Objective Wing organization which was the most comprehensive USAF reorganization plan since 1947, activating the 57th Operations Group for Nellis airfield operations and establishing the 57th Test Group.

====Air Combat Command====
Nellis transferred to Air Combat Command on 1 June 1992, at the end of the Cold War when Tactical Air Command was inactivated. The 57th Wing was designated on 15 June 1993 from the 57th Operations Group in conjunction with the introduction of the RQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The USAF Combat Rescue School was also established in 1993 for HH-60 Pave Hawk instructional flying. &quot;In 1996, AETC moved the PJ Advanced Weapons Course from Nellis AFB to Kirtland AFB&quot;. The 98th Range Wing was activated at Nellis on 29 October 2001 for Nellis Air Force Range control (previous range control was by the FWC). After Detachment 13, 372d Training Squadron opened its F/A-22 maintenance training facility on 29 November 2001, on 14 January 2003 Nellis received the first production F-22A Raptor for the F-22 Force Development Evaluation program and Weapons School (12 Raptors had been assigned to the 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron by July 2008).

&quot;Aggressor&quot; training was reactivated under the 57th Operations Group in 2003 and in 2006 Nellis had the Air Ground Operations School. On 1 May 2007, the UAV reconnaissance elements assigned to the 57th Operations Group transferred to the 432nd Wing. Detachment 1 of the Space Warfare Center was established at Nellis in 1996 after the &quot;Nellis Combined Air Operations Center&quot;, the Warfare Center transferred Nellis Air Force Range control to the 98th Range Wing in 2001, and the annual Aviation Nation airshow began at Nellis in 2002. The Nellis Solar Power Plant constructed 23 April–December 2007 on Nellis&#x27; west side was visited by president Barack Obama on 27 May 2009. In 2010, the 505th Operations Squadron operated the Combined Air and Space Operations Center-Nellis.

The 57th Adversary Tactics Group merged into the 57th Operations Group on 31 March 2020. On 1 June 2020 the 800th Rapid Engineer Deployable, Heavy Operational Repair Squadron, Engineer (RED HORSE) Group activated at Nellis, with the 820th Red Horse Squadron as a subordinate unit.

== Role and operations ==
Nellis Air Force Base is known by the USAF as the &quot;Home of the Fighter Pilot&quot; and is the Air Force&#x27;s focus for advanced combat training. The main unit at Nellis is the USAF Warfare Center, which coordinates training for composite strike forces involving aircraft types from across the USAF inventory, accompanied by air and ground units of the US Army, US Navy, US Marines, and aircraft from other NATO and allied nations. Training is delivered through a series of exercises which typically take place at the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), the primary examples being Exercise Red Flag and Exercise Green Flag (West).

As of October 2019, Nellis employed 9,500 military and civilian personnel. The total military population is more than 40,000, including family members and retired military personnel in the area.

The base also supports operations at nearby Creech Air Force Base, Tonopah Test Range, and the Nevada National Security Site. Nellis ground systems for range operations (e.g., by callsign &quot;Nellis Control&quot;) include the Computer and Computed Subsystem used to receive microwave signals from the NTTR Ground-Based per Station the Tracking and Communications Subsystem (TCS) for presentation on Nellis&#x27; Display and Debrief SubSystem (DDS).

Nellis Area I has the airfield (2 runways and ramp space for up to 300 aircraft), recreation and shopping facilities, dormitories/temporary lodging, some family housing, &quot;and most of the command and support structures&quot;, e.g., Suter Hall for Red Flag. Nellis Area II northeast of the main base &quot;at the foot of Sunrise Mountain&quot; (formerly the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Lake Mead Base) has Nellis Gun Club and the 820th Red Horse Squadron. Nellis Area III is west of the main base with family housing, administration and industrial areas, and the Mike O&#x27;Callaghan Military Medical Center. Area III also includes a munitions response area (MRA XU741) which had World War II storage for small arms ammunition, pyrotechnics, and chemical bombs and that now includes 2 remaining World War II buildings (numbers 1039 &amp; 1047), 5 modern igloos, and RV storage.

== Geography ==
Nellis AFB covers about in the northeast corner of the Las Vegas Valley, an alluvial basin in the Basin and Range Province. Since World War II, Nellis has had areas added, such as Area II in 1969, but still has about of undeveloped space. One World War II runway has been removed. The base has 3 areas (I, II, III). The United States Geological Survey names five different locations for the base: &quot;Nellis Air Force Base&quot;, the airfield, the post office, a Community College of Southern Nevada campus, and the census-designated place (CDP).

=== Census-designated place ===
The Nellis Air Force Base CDP is an region defined by the United States Census Bureau as of the 2010 United States Census. The CDP area includes military family housing (e.g., in Nellis Areas I &amp; III), dormitories, and lodging as for aircrew temporary quarters during Red Flag exercises.

=== Nellis AFB complex ===
The Nellis Air Force Base Complex is a group of southern Nevada military areas that are predominantly USAF and Bureau of Land Management areas outside of the base (e.g., controlled by military units at Nellis). The complex&#x27;s land areas include Nellis AFB, the USAF Nevada Test and Training Range, the active portion of the Small Arms Range Annex north of the base, the annex&#x27;s Formerly Used Defense Site of (cleared in March 1972, returned to the DoI), 13 BLM areas of each leased for Patriot Radar/Communications Exercises, and other BLM sites &quot;under Military Operations Area (MOA) airspace&quot;. Nellis AFB also leases space at the former Las Vegas AFS, and environmental sites of the Tonopah Bombing Range (FUDS) are monitored by the EPA. Additional Formerly Used Defense Sites associated with the area&#x27;s military operations are the Nye County Areas A, G, H, &amp; I; the &quot;Delamar Dry Lake Test Annex&quot; and the &quot;Sunrise Mountain Machine Gun Range&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* A scaled-down version of Nellis Air Force Base appears in the 2010 video game &quot;&quot;.
* The base is briefly shown in the 2007 film &quot;Transformers&quot;, where Captain William Lennox and Sergeant Robert Epps are contacted by Sector 7.
* The base is briefly mentioned at the end of &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; (2003). The base is said to be under attack from the machines.
* In the television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, Nellis Air Force Base is home to the top secret facility Area 51, where alien technologies are studied.
* The base is mentioned and features as the base from which the drone pilots operate from in the 2024 film Land Of Bad.

<text>Slapping and popping are ways to produce percussive sounds on a stringed instrument. They are primarily used on the double bass or bass guitar. Slapping on bass guitar involves using the edge of one&#x27;s knuckle, where it is particularly bony, to quickly strike the string against the fretboard. On bass guitars, this is commonly done with the thumb, while on double bass, the edge of the hand or index finger may be used. Popping refers to pulling the string away from the fretboard and quickly releasing it so it snaps back against the fretboard. On bass guitar, the two techniques are commonly used together in alternation, though either may be used separately.

==History==
On the double bass, the technique was developed by jazz bands in New Orleans in the early 1900s, and later spread to other genres, including western swing, rockabilly, and other offshoots of those styles. On the bass guitar, the technique is widely credited to Larry Graham, an electric bassist playing with Sly and the Family Stone in the late 1960s. The technique quickly spread to the funk and disco genres.

Slapping is a technique also adopted by acoustic and electric fingerstyle guitarists. John Lennon is seen slapping his guitar in the first two measures of the song &quot;Get Back&quot; in Peter Jackson&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Beatles: Get Back&quot;.

==Double bass==

On double bass it refers to the technique that is a more vigorous version of pizzicato, where the string is plucked so hard that when released it bounces off the finger board, making a distinctive sound. A percussive sound can also be made by smacking the strings with some or all of the fingers on the right hand in between the notes of a bassline, usually in time with the snare drum.

The earliest players of this technique in American music include Bill Johnson (1872–1972), Theodore &quot;Steve&quot; Brown (1890–1965), Wellman Braud (1891–1966), Pops Foster (1892–1969), and Chester Zardis (1900–1990).

Slap bass was used by Western Swing and Hillbilly Boogie musicians. It became an important component of an early form of rock and roll that combined blues and what was then called hillbilly music—a musical style now referred to as rockabilly. Bill Black, who played with Elvis Presley and Scotty Moore was a well-known slap bass player. The technique inspired the George and Ira Gershwin song &quot;Slap That Bass&quot;.
Slap bass continues to be used in the 21st century, as it is widely used by modern rockabilly and psychobilly band bassists, including Kim Nekroman (Nekromantix), Geoff Kresge (Tiger Army), Scott Owen (The Living End) and Jimbo Wallace (The Reverend Horton Heat). Kresge&#x27;s rapid slapping ability is all the more remarkable given that for much of his career he was an electric bassist. The top rockabilly and psychobilly bassists have developed the ability to perform rapid triplet slaps at the same time as they play a walking bassline.

==Bass guitar==

On bass guitar, slapping usually refers to a percussive playing technique most commonly used in funk, disco, soul, R&amp;B, jazz, country music, rock, and many other genres. The style sounds much more percussive than regular plucking of notes with the soft part of the plucking hands fingers, and is also usually louder (although on an electric instrument, the volume can be adjusted with the volume knob or through compression), brighter, and more distinct than the sound of a bass guitar played with the usual plucking or pick techniques.

The slap sound comes from the combination of two elements: slapping, which involves striking the string with the side of the bony joint in the middle of the thumb, a harder surface than the pads of the fingers (used in plucked fingering); and intentionally allowing the vibrating string to come into contact with the metal frets, producing a &quot;toney&quot; or buzzing sound that is normally avoided in plucked/fingered bass.

In the slap technique, the bassist replaces the usual plucking motion of the index and middle fingers with &quot;slaps&quot; and &quot;pops&quot;. In the slap, the bassist uses the thumb to strike the strings (usually the lower E and A strings) near the base of the bass&#x27;s neck. In the pop, the bassist will use the index or middle finger of the plucking hand to snap the strings (usually the higher D and G strings) away from the body of the bass, causing them to bounce off the fretboard; this produces a prominent buzzing tone with a sharp attack and more high-frequency vibrations than present in plucked bass.

The bassist can play many notes quickly by rotating the forearm, alternately slapping and popping: during the pop, the hand moves away from the fretboard, &quot;winding up&quot; or getting in position for the next slap. The slap and pop techniques are commonly used with pull-offs and hammer-ons with the fretting (usually left) hand, to further increase the rate at which notes may be played. Ghost notes, or notes played with the string damped, are also commonly played in slap bass to increase the percussive feel of the technique.

The invention of slap on electric bass is generally credited to funk bassist Larry Graham. Graham has stated in several interviews that he was trying to emulate the sound of a drum set before his band had found its drummer. Graham himself refers to the technique as &quot;thumpin&#x27; and pluckin&#x27;&quot;.

== Variants ==
There are numerous variants of the slapping technique. Some bassists use other fingers of the strumming hand to achieve this sound, such as bassist Abraham Laboriel, Sr., who uses his thumb to pop the strings, and his other four fingers to slap the strings. Bassist Victor Wooten uses a double thump technique which is like a slap, but uses both sides of the thumb for all the strings, fast enough to produce the equivalent of a drumroll on the bass guitar.

Funk fingers invented by progressive rock bass player Tony Levin create a similar sound by using a hard surface to strike the strings and intentionally cause string contact with the fretboard. Spank bass developed from the slap and pop style and treats the electric bass as a percussion instrument, striking the strings above the pickups with an open palmed hand.

The slap technique bears some resemblance to tambour, a percussive technique used in flamenco and classical guitar, although the tonal quality produced in this technique is quite different from that of a slapped electric bass. Japanese musician Miyavi is well known for creating a unique slapping style of playing electric guitars. Tosin Abasi, guitarist for progressive metal band Animals as Leaders, is also known for a slapping and popping technique on electric guitar, which he uses for both melodic and percussive effect.
