<text>José de Acosta, SJ (1539 or 1540 in Medina del Campo, Spain – February 15, 1600 in Salamanca, Spain) was a sixteenth-century Spanish Jesuit missionary and naturalist in Latin America. His deductions regarding the ill effects of crossing over the Andes in 1570 related to the atmosphere being too thin for human needs led to the modern understanding of a variety of altitude sickness, now referred to as &quot;Acosta&#x27;s disease&quot;.

==Life==
José de Acosta was born in Medina del Campo in Spain, about twenty-four miles from Valladolid, in Old Castile, on the left bank of the swampy river Zapardiel, and overlooked by the old castle of La Mota. He was of converso background. His parents had five sons, Gerónimo, Christóval, José, Diego, and Bernardo. The Acosta brothers were fellow townsmen of the elder soldier Bernal Diaz, who told the story of the Spanish conquest of Mexico. In 1553, at the age of thirteen, Acosta became a novice in the Society of Jesus in Medina del Campo. Four of the five Acosta brothers joined this order. Before leaving Spain, José was lecturer in theology at Ocana, and in April 1569, was to be sent to Lima, Peru, where the Jesuits had been established in the proceeding year. According to one scholar, Acosta was &quot;a heavy man of uncertain, melancholic temper.&quot;

===Panama===
At age 32, Acosta left Spain with several other Jesuits in 1570, landing at Cartagena de Indias, and finally at Nombre de Dios, then journeyed through 18 leagues – about – of tropical forest. On this journey, he was impressed by the scenery, novel sights, and the clever antics of troops of monkeys in Capira. From Panama, he embarked for Peru to pursue missionary work. He expected to experience unbearably intense heat in crossing the equator, but found it to be so cool in March, that he laughed at Aristotle and his philosophy.

===Peru and Acosta&#x27;s disease===
On his arrival at Lima, he was ordered to cross the Andes, apparently to join the Viceroy of Peru in the interior. He took the route, with fourteen or fifteen companions, across the mountainous province of Huarochiri, and by the lofty pass of Pariacaca (over ), where the whole party suffered severely from the effects of the rarefied atmosphere. Acosta describes these sufferings, which were to be repeated on the three other occasions of crossing the cordillera. Acosta was one of the earliest people to give a detailed description of altitude sickness, and to link it to &quot;air... so thin and so delicate that it is not proportioned to human breathing&quot;, and a variety of altitude sickness is referred to as &quot;Acosta&#x27;s disease&quot;. He also mentions an attack of snow blindness and the way in which an Indian woman cured him.

Acosta had arrived in Peru two years after Don Francisco de Toledo had become Viceroy in 1568. Following Toledo&#x27;s beheading of the Inca Túpac Amaru, the Viceroy devoted five years to a tour through every part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, and to settlement of the country, in which he was aided by Acosta, the licentiate Polo de Ondegardo, and the Judge Juan Ortiz de Matienzo. Acosta also accompanied the Viceroy to Charcas, and was with him during his unsuccessful expedition against the fierce Chirihuana Indians.

The principal seat of the Jesuits was at that time in the little town of Juli, near the western shores of Lake Titicaca. Here a college was formed, the languages of the natives were studied, and, eventually, a printing press was established. Acosta probably resided at Juli during much of his stay in Peru. It was here, in all likelihood, that he observed the famous comet of 1577, from November 1 to December 8, which extended like a fiery plume from the horizon nearly to the zenith. Here, too, he devoted much of his time to the preparation of several learned works, which he later took back to Spain in manuscript, including the first two books of the &quot;Natural History of the Indies&quot;. At Juli, Father Acosta received information respecting the Amazon River from a brother who had formerly been in the famous piratical cruise of Lope de Aguirre.

Towards the close of the viceroyalty of Toledo, Father Acosta appears to have moved from the interior of Peru to Lima. Here he mentions superintending the casting of a great bell, for which there was difficulty in getting fuel for the furnace, making it necessary to fell great trees in the Rímac River&#x27;s valley. Viceroy Toledo was practically the founder of the University of St. Mark at Lima, where Acosta was to occupy the chair of theology. Here he was again able to display his abilities as a famed orator.

In 1571, José went to Cuzco as a visitor of the recently founded college of the Jesuits. He returned to Lima three years later to again fill the chair of theology, and was elected provincial in 1576.

In 1579, the Viceroy dispatched a fleet under Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, partly to chase Sir Francis Drake on the coast, and partly to explore and survey the Strait of Magellan. Acosta had conversations with the pilot of Sarmiento&#x27;s fleet, and was allowed to inspect his chart, thus obtaining much hydrographic information, and particulars respecting the tides in the straits. He also conversed with the new Viceroy Don Martín Henríquez on the same subject.

Acosta founded a number of colleges, among them those of Arequipa, Potosí, Chuquisaca, Panama and La Paz, even when met with considerable opposition from the Viceroy Toledo. His official duties obliged him to investigate personally a very extensive range of territory, so that he acquired a practical knowledge of the vast province, and of its aboriginal inhabitants. At the 1582 session of the Third Council of Lima, Father Acosta played a very important part and was its historian. He delivered an eloquent and learned oration at its last sitting on October 18, 1583.

===Mexico===
Shortly after the Third Council of Lima, he embarked with all his manuscripts, the literary labors of fifteen years, and commenced his voyage to Mexico. During the passage, he was a shrewd observer of nature and knowledge seeker. He learned from an expert Portuguese pilot that there were four often-visited ports of no magnetic compass variation on the Earth, and that one of them was Corvo Island in the Azores. Acosta landed at the port of Huatulco, at the western end of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, in the Oaxaca province, then journeyed by land to Mexico City, where he resided in 1586. He had opportunities of which he diligently availed himself for collecting information touching the civilization and religion of the Aztecs and natural products of this country. His chief informant respecting the rites and festivals of the Mexicans was brother and Prebendary, Juan de Tobar. For information on the Mexica, Acosta followed Juan de Tovar&#x27;s &quot;Relación del origen de los indios que habitan esta Nueva España según sus historias&quot;, a possible summary of Fray Diego Durán&#x27;s &quot;Historia de las Indias de Nueva España e islas de Tierra Firme&quot;—in turn derived in part from an anonymous Nahuatl history of Mexico-Tenochtitlan, known as the &quot;Crónica X&quot;.

===Return to Spain===
Acosta had been called to Spain by the King in 1585, prior to being detained in Mexico, in order to debate against Alonzo Sánchez&#x27;s plans to initiate an invasion of China. He sailed home to Spain in the fleet of 1587, which contained a precious cargo, including twelve chests of gold each weighing , 11,000,000 pieces of silver, and two chests of emeralds each also weighing , in addition to loads of ginger, sarsaparilla, Brazil wood and animal hides. In Spain he filled the chair of theology at the Roman college in 1594, head of the Jesuits College at Valladolid, as well as other important positions. At the time of his death in his 60th year, he was rector of the college at Salamanca.

==Works==

Aside from his publication of the proceedings of the provincial councils of 1567 and 1583, and several works of exclusively theological import, Acosta is best known as the writer of , and above all, the . The first two appeared at Salamanca in 1588, the last at Seville in 1590, and was soon after its publication translated into various languages. It is chiefly the that has established the reputation of Acosta, as this was one of the first detailed and realistic descriptions of the New World. In a form more concise than that employed by his predecessors, Francisco Lopez de Gómara and Oviedo, he treated the natural and philosophic history of the New World from a broader point of view. In it, more than a century before other Europeans learned of the Bering Strait, Acosta hypothesized that Latin America&#x27;s indigenous peoples had migrated from Asia. He also divided them into three barbarian categories. The &quot;Historia&quot; also described Inca and Aztec customs and history, as well as other information such as winds and tides, lakes, rivers, plants, animals, and mineral resources in the New World.

<doc id="201203" wikidata="Q190927" url="?curid=201203" title="Beringia">
<text>Beringia is defined today as the land and maritime area bounded on the west by the Lena River in Russia; on the east by the Mackenzie River in Canada; on the north by 72° north latitude in the Chukchi Sea; and on the south by the tip of the Kamchatka Peninsula. It includes the Chukchi Sea, the Bering Sea, the Bering Strait, the Chukchi and Kamchatka Peninsulas in Russia as well as Alaska in the United States and the Yukon in Canada.

The area includes land lying on the North American Plate and Siberian land east of the Chersky Range. At various times, it formed a land bridge referred to as the Bering land bridge, that was up to wide at its greatest extent and which covered an area as large as British Columbia and Alberta together, totaling about , allowing biological dispersal to occur between Asia and North America. Today, the only land that is visible from the central part of the Bering land bridge are the Diomede Islands, the Pribilof Islands of St. Paul and St. George, St. Lawrence Island, St. Matthew Island, and King Island.

It is believed that a small human population of at most a few thousand arrived in Beringia from eastern Siberia during the Last Glacial Maximum before expanding into the settlement of the Americas sometime after 16,500 years Before Present (YBP). This would have occurred as the American glaciers blocking the way southward melted, but before the bridge was covered by the sea about 11,000 YBP.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Beringia&quot; was coined by the Swedish botanist Eric Hultén in 1937, from the Danish-born Russian explorer Vitus Bering. During the ice ages, Beringia, like most of Siberia and all of North and Northeast China, was not glaciated because snowfall was very light.

== Geography ==
The remains of Late Pleistocene mammals that had been discovered on the Aleutians and islands in the Bering Sea at the close of the nineteenth century indicated that a past land connection might lie beneath the shallow waters between Alaska and Chukotka. The underlying mechanism was first thought to be tectonics, but by 1930 changes in the ice mass balance, leading to global sea-level fluctuations were viewed as the cause of the Bering land bridge. In 1937, Eric Hultén proposed that around the Aleutians and the Bering Strait region were tundra plants that had originally dispersed from a now-submerged plain between Alaska and Chukotka, which he named Beringia after Vitus Bering who had sailed into the strait in 1728. The American arctic geologist David Hopkins redefined Beringia to include portions of Alaska and Northeast Asia. Beringia was later regarded as extending from the Verkhoyansk Mountains in the west to the Mackenzie River in the east. The distribution of plants in the genera &quot;Erythranthe&quot; and &quot;Pinus&quot; are good examples of this, as very similar genera members are found in Asia and the Americas.

During the Pleistocene epoch, global cooling led periodically to the expansion of glaciers and the lowering of sea levels. This created land connections in various regions around the globe. Today, the average water depth of the Bering Strait is ; therefore the land bridge opened when the sea level dropped more than below the current level. A reconstruction of the sea-level history of the region indicated that a seaway existed from  YBP, a land bridge from  YBP, an intermittent connection from  YBP, a land bridge from  YBP, followed by a Holocene sea-level rise that reopened the strait. Post-glacial rebound has continued to raise some sections of the coast.
During the last glacial period, enough of the Earth&#x27;s water became frozen in the great ice sheets covering North America and Europe to cause a drop in sea levels. For thousands of years the sea floors of many interglacial shallow seas were exposed, including those of the Bering Strait, the Chukchi Sea to the north, and the Bering Sea to the south. Other land bridges around the world have emerged and disappeared in the same way. Around 14,000 years ago, mainland Australia was linked to both New Guinea and Tasmania, the British Isles became an extension of continental Europe via the dry beds of the English Channel and North Sea, and the dry bed of the South China Sea linked Sumatra, Java, and Borneo to Indochina.

==Refugium==


The last glacial period, commonly referred to as the &quot;Ice Age&quot;, spanned 125,000–14,500YBP and was the most recent glacial period within the current ice age, which occurred during the last years of the Pleistocene era. The Ice Age reached its peak during the Last Glacial Maximum, when ice sheets began advancing from 33,000YBP and reached their maximum limits 26,500YBP. Deglaciation commenced in the Northern Hemisphere approximately 19,000YBP and in Antarctica approximately 14,500 yearsYBP, which is consistent with evidence that glacial meltwater was the primary source for an abrupt rise in sea level 14,500YBP and the bridge was finally inundated around 11,000 YBP. The fossil evidence from many continents points to the extinction of large animals, termed Pleistocene megafauna, near the end of the last glaciation.

During the Ice Age a vast, cold and dry Mammoth steppe stretched from the arctic islands southwards to China, and from Spain eastwards across Eurasia and over the Bering land bridge into Alaska and the Yukon where it was blocked by the Wisconsin glaciation. Therefore, the flora and fauna of Beringia were more related to those of Eurasia rather than North America. Beringia received more moisture and intermittent maritime cloud cover from the north Pacific Ocean than the rest of the Mammoth steppe, including the dry environments on either side of it. This moisture supported a shrub-tundra habitat that provided an ecological refugium for plants and animals. In East Beringia 35,000 YBP, the northern arctic areas experienced temperatures degrees warmer than today but the southern sub-Arctic regions were degrees cooler. During the LGM 22,000 YBP the average summer temperature was degrees cooler than today, with variations of degrees cooler on the Seward Peninsula to cooler in the Yukon. In the driest and coldest periods of the Late Pleistocene, and possibly during the entire Pleistocene, moisture occurred along a north–south gradient with the south receiving the most cloud cover and moisture due to the air-flow from the North Pacific.

In the Late Pleistocene, Beringia was a mosaic of biological communities. Commencing from  YBP (MIS 3), steppe–tundra vegetation dominated large parts of Beringia with a rich diversity of grasses and herbs. There were patches of shrub tundra with isolated refugia of larch (&quot;Larix&quot;) and spruce (&quot;Picea&quot;) forests with birch (&quot;Betula&quot;) and alder (&quot;Alnus&quot;) trees. It has been proposed that the largest and most diverse megafaunal community residing in Beringia at this time could only have been sustained in a highly diverse and productive environment. 

Analysis at Chukotka on the Siberian edge of the land bridge indicated that from  YBP (MIS 3 to MIS 2) the environment was wetter and colder than the steppe–tundra to the east and west, with warming in parts of Beringia from  YBP. These changes provided the most likely explanation for mammal migrations after  YBP, as the warming provided increased forage for browsers and mixed feeders. At the beginning of the Holocene, some mesic habitat-adapted species left the refugium and spread westward into what had become tundra-vegetated northern Asia and eastward into northern North America.

The latest emergence of the land bridge was years ago. However, from  YBP the Laurentide Ice Sheet fused with the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, which blocked gene flow between Beringia (and Eurasia) and continental North America. The Yukon corridor opened between the receding ice sheets  YBP, and this once again allowed gene flow between Eurasia and continental North America until the land bridge was finally closed by rising sea levels  YBP. During the Holocene, many mesic-adapted species left the refugium and spread eastward and westward, while at the same time the forest-adapted species spread with the forests up from the south. The arid-adapted species were reduced to minor habitats or became extinct.

Beringia constantly transformed its ecosystem as the changing climate affected the environment, determining which plants and animals were able to survive. The land mass could be a barrier as well as a bridge: during colder periods, glaciers advanced and precipitation levels dropped. During warmer intervals, clouds, rain and snow altered soils and drainage patterns. Fossil remains show that spruce, birch and poplar once grew beyond their northernmost range today, indicating that there were periods when the climate was warmer and wetter. The environmental conditions were not homogenous in Beringia. Recent stable isotope studies of woolly mammoth bone collagen demonstrate that western Beringia (Siberia) was colder and drier than eastern Beringia (Alaska and Yukon), which was more ecologically diverse.

Grey wolves suffered a species-wide population bottleneck (reduction) approximately 25,000 YBP during the Last Glacial Maximum. This was followed by a single population of modern wolves expanding out of their Beringia refuge to repopulate the wolf&#x27;s former range, replacing the remaining Late Pleistocene wolf populations across Eurasia and North America.

The extinct pine species &quot;Pinus matthewsii&quot; has been described from Pliocene sediments in the Yukon areas of the refugium.

=== Beringian Gap ===
The existence of fauna endemic to the respective Siberian and North American portions of Beringia has led to the &#x27;Beringian Gap&#x27; hypothesis, wherein an unconfirmed geographic factor blocked migration across the land bridge when it emerged. Beringia did not block the movement of most dry steppe-adapted large species such as saiga antelope, woolly mammoth, and caballid horses. Notable restricted fauna include the woolly rhino in Siberia (which went no further east than the Anadyr River), and &quot;Arctodus simus&quot;, American badger, American kiang-like equids, &quot;Bootherium&quot; and &quot;Camelops&quot; in North America, with the existence of &quot;Homotherium&quot; being disputed in Late Pleistocene Siberia. The lack of mastodon and &quot;Megalonyx&quot; has been attributed to their inhabitation of Alaska and the Yukon being limited to interglacials. However, ground sloth eDNA has potentially been recovered from Siberia.

== Human habitation and migration==

Around 3,000 years ago, the progenitors of the Yupik peoples settled along both sides of the straits. The governments of Russia and the United States announced a plan to formally establish &quot;a transboundary area of shared Beringian heritage&quot;. Among other things this agreement would establish close ties between the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve and the Cape Krusenstern National Monument in the United States and Beringia National Park in Russia.

== Previous connections ==
Biogeographical evidence demonstrates previous connections between North America and Asia. Similar dinosaur fossils occur both in Asia and in North America. The dinosaur &quot;Saurolophus&quot; was found in both Mongolia and western North America. Relatives of &quot;Troodon&quot;, &quot;Triceratops&quot;, and &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; all came from Asia.

The earliest &quot;Canis lupus&quot; specimen was a fossil tooth discovered at Old Crow, Yukon, Canada. The specimen was found in sediment dated 1 million YBP, however the geological attribution of this sediment is questioned. Slightly younger specimens were discovered at Cripple Creek Sump, Fairbanks, Alaska, in strata dated 810,000 YBP. Both discoveries point to the origin of these wolves in eastern Beringia during the Middle Pleistocene. 

Fossil evidence also indicates an exchange of primates and plants between North America and Asia around 55.8 million years ago. 20 million years ago, evidence in North America shows the last natural interchange of mammalian species. Some, like the ancient saber-toothed cats, have a recurring geographical range: Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America. The pattern of bidirectional flow of biota has been asymmetric, with more plants, animals, and fungi generally migrating from Asia to North America than vice versa throughout the Cenozoic.

<text>Coral Records was a subsidiary of Decca Records that was formed in 1949. Coral released music by Patsy Cline, Buddy Holly, the McGuire Sisters and Teresa Brewer.

Coral issued jazz and swing music in the 1940s, but after Bob Thiele became head of the label in 1954, he produced pop and rock musicians such as Buddy Holly, Jackie Wilson, Lawrence Welk, and Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gormé. He also produced hit songs by his wife, Teresa Brewer.

Coral stopped issuing new material in 1971. In 1973, MCA amalgamated Decca, Kapp Records, and Uni Records under the single MCA Records banner, and Coral was repositioned as a mid-line and budget album reissue label in the U.S. and internationally. That version of Coral (MCA Coral) lasted into the 1980s. Some product from MCA&#x27;s former Vocalion Records budget label was manufactured with MCA Coral labels that bore Vocalion catalog numbers and was shipped in sleeves still bearing the Vocalion trademark, presumably to cut costs.

<doc id="201208" wikidata="Q388614" url="?curid=201208" title="Afrotropical realm">
<text>The Afrotropical realm is one of the Earth&#x27;s eight biogeographic realms. It includes Sub-Saharan Africa, the southern Arabian Peninsula, the island of Madagascar, and the islands of the western Indian Ocean. It was formerly known as the Ethiopian Zone or Ethiopian Region.

== Major ecological regions ==
Most of the Afrotropical realm, except for Africa&#x27;s southern tip, has a tropical climate. A broad belt of deserts, including the Atlantic and Sahara deserts of northern Africa and the Arabian Desert of the Arabian Peninsula, separates the Afrotropic from the Palearctic realm, which includes northern Africa and temperate Eurasia.

=== Sahel and Sudan ===
South of the Sahara, two belts of tropical grassland and savanna run east and west across the continent, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ethiopian Highlands. Immediately south of the Sahara lies the Sahel belt, a transitional zone of semi-arid short grassland and vachellia savanna. Rainfall increases further south in the Sudanian Savanna, also known simply as the Sudan region, a belt of taller grasslands and savannas. The Sudanian Savanna is home to two great flooded grasslands: the Sudd wetland in South Sudan, and the Niger Inland Delta in Mali. The forest-savanna mosaic is a transitional zone between the grasslands and the belt of tropical moist broadleaf forests near the equator.

=== Southern Arabian woodlands ===
South Arabia, which includes Yemen and parts of western Oman and southwestern Saudi Arabia, has few permanent forests. Some of the notable ones are Jabal Bura, Jabal Raymah, and Jabal Badaj in the Yemeni highland escarpment and the seasonal forests in eastern Yemen and the Dhofar region of Oman. Other woodlands that scatter the land are small, predominantly &quot;Juniperus&quot; or &quot;Vachellia&quot; forests.

=== Forest zone ===
The forest zone, a belt of lowland tropical moist broadleaf forests, runs across most of equatorial Africa&#x27;s Intertropical Convergence Zone. The Upper Guinean forests of West Africa extend along the coast from Guinea to Togo. The Dahomey Gap, a zone of forest-savanna mosaic that reaches to the coast, separates the Upper Guinean forests from the Lower Guinean forests, which extend along the Gulf of Guinea from eastern Benin through Cameroon and Gabon to the western Democratic Republic of the Congo. The largest tropical forest zone in Africa is the Congolian forests of the Congo Basin in Central Africa.

A belt of tropical moist broadleaf forest also runs along the Indian Ocean coast, from southern Somalia to South Africa.

=== Somali–Masai region ===
In northeastern Africa, semi-arid Acacia-Commiphora woodlands, savannas, and bushlands are the dominant plant communities. This region is called the Somali-Masai center of endemism or Somali-Masai region. It extends from central Tanzania northwards through the Horn of Africa and covers portions of Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Djibouti, and Eritrea. Thorny, dry-season deciduous species of &quot;Vachellia&quot; and &quot;Senegalia&quot; (formerly &quot;Acacia&quot;) and &quot;Commiphora&quot; are the dominant trees, growing in open-canopied woodlands, open savannas, dense bushlands, and thickets. This region includes the Serengeti ecosystem, which is renowned for its wildlife.

=== Eastern Africa&#x27;s highlands ===

The Afromontane region extends from the Ethiopian Highlands to the Drakensberg Mountains of South Africa, including the East African Rift. This region is home to distinctive flora, including &quot;Podocarpus&quot; and &quot;Afrocarpus&quot;, as well as giant &quot;Lobelias&quot; and &quot;Senecios&quot;.
* Ethiopian Highlands
* Albertine rift montane forests
* East African montane forests and Eastern Arc forests

=== Zambezian region ===
The Zambezian region includes woodlands, savannas, grasslands, and thickets. Characteristic plant communities include Miombo woodlands, drier mopane and &quot;Baikiaea&quot; woodlands, and higher-elevation Bushveld. It extends from east to west in a broad belt across the continent, south of the rainforests of the Guineo-Congolian region, and north of the deserts of southeastern Africa, the countries are Malawi, Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, and the subtropical.

=== Deserts of Southern Africa ===
Southern Africa contains several deserts. The Namib Desert is one of the oldest deserts in the world and extends for over 2,000 kilometers along the Atlantic coasts of Angola, Namibia, and South Africa. It is characterized by towering dunes and a diversity of endemic wildlife. Further inland concerning the Namib Desert, the Kalahari Desert is a semi-arid savanna spanning Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa. The Kalahari is known for its diversity of mineral resources, particularly diamonds, as well as a variety of flora. South of the Namib and Kalahari deserts is the Karoo. A semi-desert natural region, the Karoo desert spans across parts of the Western and Eastern Cape in South Africa and contains vast open spaces and unique vegetation, such as certain species of Asteraceae flowering plants. Within the boundaries of the larger Karoo, the Tankwa Karoo is a more arid sub-region known for harsher conditions and starker landscapes. Further to the west, the Richtersveld, a mountainous desert in the northwestern corner of South Africa, presents a rugged landscape. It is celebrated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique biodiversity and cultural significance to the local Nama people.

=== Cape floristic region ===
The Cape floristic region at Africa&#x27;s southern tip is a Mediterranean climate region that is home to a significant number of endemic taxa, as well as to plant families like the proteas (&quot;Proteaceae&quot;) that are also found in the Australasian realm.

=== Madagascar and the Indian Ocean islands ===
Madagascar and neighboring islands form a distinctive sub-region of the realm, with numerous endemic taxa, such as lemurs. Madagascar and the Granitic Seychelles are old pieces of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, and broke away from Africa millions of years ago. Other Indian Ocean islands, like the Comoros and Mascarene Islands, are volcanic islands that formed more recently. Madagascar contains various plant habitats, from rainforests to mountains and deserts, as its biodiversity and ratio of endemism are extremely high.

== Endemic plants and animals ==
=== Plants ===
The Afrotropical realm is home to several endemic plant families. Madagascar and the Indian Ocean Islands are home to ten endemic families of flowering plants; eight are endemic to Madagascar (Asteropeiaceae, Didymelaceae, Didiereaceae, Kaliphoraceae, Melanophyllaceae, Physenaceae, Sarcolaenaceae, and Sphaerosepalaceae), one to Seychelles (Mesdusagynaceae), and one to the Mascarene Islands (Psiloxylaceae). Twelve plant families are endemic or nearly endemic to South Africa (including Curtisiaceae, Heteropyxidaceae, Penaeaceae, Psiloxylaceae, and Rhynchocalycaceae) of which five are endemic to the Cape floristic province (including Grubbiaceae). Other endemic Afrotropic families include Barbeyaceae, Dirachmaceae, Montiniaceae, Myrothamnaceae, and Oliniaceae.

=== Animals ===
The East African Great Lakes (Victoria, Malawi, and Tanganyika) are the center of biodiversity of many freshwater fishes, especially cichlids (they harbor more than two-thirds of the estimated 2,000 species in the family). The West African coastal rivers region covers only a fraction of West Africa, but harbors 322 of West Africa&#x27;s fish species, with 247 restricted to this area and 129 restricted even
to smaller ranges. The central rivers fauna comprise 194 fish species, with 119 endemics and only 33 restricted to small areas.

The Afrotropic has various endemic bird families, including ostriches (Struthionidae), the secretary bird (Sagittariidae), guineafowl (Numididae), and mousebirds (Coliidae). Several families of passerines are limited to the Afrotropics, including rock-jumpers (Chaetopidae) and rockfowl (Picathartidae).

Africa has three endemic orders of mammals, the Tubulidentata (aardvarks), Afrosoricida (tenrecs and golden moles), and Macroscelidea (elephant shrews). The East-African plains are well known for their diversity of large mammals.

Four species of great apes (Hominidae) are endemic to Central Africa: both species of gorilla (western gorilla, &quot;Gorilla gorilla&quot;, and eastern gorilla, &quot;Gorilla beringei&quot;) and both species of chimpanzee (common chimpanzee, &quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;, and bonobo, &quot;Pan paniscus&quot;). Humans and their ancestors originated in Africa.

== Afrotropical terrestrial ecoregions ==




== Habitats ==
The tropical environment is rich in terms of biodiversity. Tropical African forest is 18 percent of the world&#x27;s total and covers over 3.6 million square kilometers of land in West, East, and Central Africa. This total area can be subdivided to 2.69 million square kilometers (74%) in Central Africa, 680,000 square kilometers (19%) in West Africa, and 250,000 square kilometers (7%) in East Africa. In West Africa, a chain of rain forests up to 350 km long extends from the eastern border of Sierra Leone to Ghana. In Ghana, the forest zone gradually dispels near the Volta river, following a 300  km stretch of Dahomey savanna gap. The rain forest of West Africa continues from east of Benin through southern Nigeria and officially ends at the border of Cameroon along the Sanaga river.
Semi-deciduous rainforests in West Africa begin at the fringed coastline of Guinea Bissau (via Guinea) and run through the coasts of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, continuing through Togo, Benin, Nigeria and Cameroon, and ending at the Congo Basin. Rainforests such as these are the richest, oldest, most prolific, and most complex systems on Earth, are dying, and in turn, are upsetting the delicate ecological balance. This may disturb global hydrological cycles, release vast amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and lessen the planet&#x27;s ability to store excess carbon.

The rainforest vegetation of the Guinea-Congolian transition area, extending from Senegal to western Uganda is constituted of two main types: The semi-deciduous rainforest is characterized by a large number of trees whose leaves are left during the dry season. It appears in areas where the dry period (rainfall below about 100  mm) reaches three months. Then, the evergreen or the semi-evergreen rainforest climatically adapted to somewhat more humid conditions than the semi-deciduous type and is usually there in areas where the dry period is shorter than two months. This forest is usually richer in legumes and a variety of species and its maximum development is around the Bight of Biafra, from Eastern Nigeria to Gabon, and with some large patches leaning to the west from Ghana to Liberia and to the east of Zaïre-Congo basin.

Among rainforest areas in other continents, most of the African rainforest is comparatively dry and receives between 1600 and 2000 mm of rainfall per year. Areas receiving more rain than this mainly are in coastal areas. The circulation of rainfall throughout the year remains less than in other rainforest regions in the world. The average monthly rainfall in nearly the whole region remains under 100  mm throughout the year. The variety of the African rainforest flora is also less than the other rainforests. This lack of flora has been credited to several reasons such as the gradual infertility since the Miocene, severe dry periods during Quaternary, or the refuge theory of the cool and dry climate of tropical Africa during the last severe ice age of about 18,000 years ago.

== Fauna ==

The Tropical African rainforest has rich fauna, commonly smaller mammal species rarely seen by humans. New species are being discovered. For instance, in late 1988 an unknown shrub species was discovered on the shores of the Median River in Western Cameroon. Since then many species have become extinct. However, undisturbed rainforests are some of the richest habitats for animal species. Today, undisturbed rainforests are remnant but rare. Timber extraction not only changes the edifice of the forest, but it also affects the tree species spectrum by removing economically important species and terminating other species in the process. The species that compose African rainforests are of different evolutionary ages because of the contraction and expansion of the rainforest in response to global climatic fluctuations.

The pygmy hippopotamus, the giant forest hog, the water chevrotain, insectivores, rodents, bats, tree frogs, and bird species inhabit the forest. These species, along with a diversity of fruits and insects, make a special habitat that allows for a diversity of life. The top canopy is home to monkey species like the red colobus, Black-and-white Colobus, and many other Old-World monkey species. Many of these rare and unique species are endangered or critically endangered and need protection from poachers and provided ample habitat to thrive.

== Flora ==
In Tropical Africa, about 8,500 plant species have been documented, including 403 orchid species.

Species unfamiliar with the changes in forest structure for industrial use might not survive. If timber use continues and an increasing amount of farming occurs, it could lead to the mass killing of animal species. The home of nearly half of the world&#x27;s animals and plant species are tropical rainforests. The rainforests provide economic resources for over-populated developing countries. Despite the stated need to save the West African forests, there are varied opinions on how best to accomplish this goal. In April 1992, countries with some of the largest surviving tropical rainforests banned a rainforest protection plan proposed by the British government. It aimed at finding endangered species of tropical trees to control their trade. Experts estimate that the rainforest of West Africa, at the present rate of deforestation, may disappear by the year 2020.

Africa&#x27;s rainforest, like many others emergent in the world, has a special significance to the indigenous peoples of Africa who have occupied them for millennia.

== Region protection ==
Many African countries are in economic and political change, overwhelmed by conflict, making various movements of forest exploitation to maintain forest management and production more and more complicated.

Forest legislation of ATO member countries aims to promote the balanced utilization of the forest domain and of wildlife and fishery to increase the input of the forest sector to the economic, social, cultural, and scientific development of the country.

===Deforestation===

The rate of deforestation in Africa is less known than the rate of other tropical regions. A lack of dependable data and survey information in some countries has made change in areas of unbroken forest difficult to ascertain.

The cultivation of various cash crops has led to forest depletion. West African countries depend on products like gum, copal, rubber, cola nuts, and palm oil as a source of steady income. Land use change spoils entire habitats with the forests. The conversion of forests into timber is another cause of deforestation. Over decades, the primary forest product was commercial timber. Urbanized countries account for a great percentage of the world&#x27;s wood consumption, which increased greatly between 1950 and 1980. Simultaneously, preservation measures were reinforced to protect European and American forests. Economic growth and growing environmental protection in industrialized European countries caused increased demand for tropical hardwood from West Africa. In the first half of the 1980s, an annual forest loss of was noted down along the Gulf of Guinea, a figure equivalent to 4-5 percent of the total remaining rainforest area. By 1985, 72% of West Africa&#x27;s rainforests had been transformed into fallow lands and an additional 9% had been opened up by timber exploitation.

Tropical timber was used in Europe following World War II, as trade with East European countries stopped and timber noticeably became sparse in western and southern Europe. Despite efforts to promote lesser-known timber species use, the market continued to focus on part of the usable timber obtainable. West Africa was prone to selective harvesting practices; while conservationists blamed the timber industry and the farmers for felling trees, others believe rainforest destruction is connected to the problem of fuel wood. The contribution of fuel wood consumption to tree stock decline in Africa is believed to be significant. It is generally believed that firewood provides 75% of the energy used in sub-Sahara Africa. With the high demand, the consumption of wood for fuel exceeds the renewal of forest cover.

Other observed changes in these forests are forest disintegration (changing the spatial continuity and creating a mosaic of forest blocks and other land cover types), and selective logging of woody species for profitable purposes that affect the forest subfloor and the biodiversity.
The rainforests that remain in West Africa now greatly differ in condition from their state 30 years ago. In Guinea, Liberia, and the Ivory Coast, there is almost no primary forest cover left unscathed; in Ghana, the situation is much worse, and nearly all of the rainforest is being removed. Guinea-Bissau loses of forest yearly, Senegal of wooded savanna, and Nigeria 6,000,050,000 of both. Liberia loses of forests each year. Extrapolating from present rates of loss, botanist Peter Raven pictures that the majority of the world&#x27;s moderate and smaller rainforests (such as in Africa) could be destroyed in forty years. Tropical Africa comprises 18% of the world&#x27;s total land area covering of land in West and Central Africa. The region has been facing deforestation in various degrees of intensity throughout the recent decades. The actual rate of deforestation varies from one country to another and accurate data does not exist yet. Recent estimates show that the annual pace of deforestation in the region can vary from in Gabon to in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. The remaining tropical forests still cover major areas in Central Africa but are abridged by patches in West Africa.

The African Timber Organization member countries eventually recognized the cooperation between rural people and their forest environment. Customary law gives residents the right to use trees for firewood, fell trees for construction, and collect of forest products and rights for hunting or fishing and grazing or clearing of forests for maintenance agriculture. Other areas are called &quot;protected forests&quot;, which means that uncontrolled clearings and unauthorized logging are forbidden. After World War II, commercial exploitation increased until no West African forestry department was able to make the law. By comparison with rainforests in other places of the world in 1973, Africa showed the greatest infringement though in total volume means, African timber production accounted for just one-third compared to that of Asia. The difference was due to the variety of trees in Africa forests and the demand for specific wood types in Europe.

Forestry regulations in East Africa were first applied by colonial governments. The Tropical Forestry Action Plan was conceived in 1987 by the World Resources Institute in cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations Development Program, and the World Bank with hopes of halting tropical forest destruction. In its bid to stress forest conservation and development, the World Bank provided $111,103 million to developing countries, especially in Africa, to help in developing long-range forest conservation and management programs meant for ending deforestation.

== Historical temperature and climate ==
In early 2007, scientists created an entirely new proxy to determine the annual mean air temperature on land—based on molecules from the cell membrane of soil-inhabiting bacteria. Scientists from the NIOZ, Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research conducted a temperature record dating back to 25,000 years ago.

In concordance with their German colleagues at the University of Bremen, this detailed record shows the history of land temperatures based on the molecular fossils of soil bacteria. When applying this to the outflow core of the Congo River, the core contained eroded land material and microfossils from marine algae. That concluded that the land environment of tropical Africa cooled more than the bordering Atlantic Ocean during the last ice age. Since the Congo River drains a large part of tropical central Africa, the land-derived material gives an integrated signal for a very large area. These findings further enlighten natural disparities in climate and the possible costs of a warming earth on precipitation in central Africa.

Scientists discovered a way to measure sea temperature—based on organic molecules from algae growing off the surface layer of the Ocean. These organisms acclimatize the molecular composition of their cell membranes to ambient temperature to sustain regular physiological properties. If such molecules sink to the sea floor and are buried in sediments where oxygen does not go through, they can be preserved for thousands of years. The ratios between the different molecules from the algal cell membrane can approximate the past temperature of the sea surface. The new “proxy” used in this sediment core obtained both a continental and a sea surface temperature record. In comparison, both records show that ocean surface and land temperatures behaved differently during the past 25,000 years. During the last ice age, African temperatures were 21 °C, about 4 °C lower than today, while the tropical Atlantic Ocean was only about 2.5 °C cooler. Lead author Johan Weijers and his colleagues concluded that the land-sea temperature difference has by far the largest influence on continental rainfall. The relation of air pressure to temperature strongly determines this factor. During the last ice age, the land climate in tropical Africa was drier than it is now, whereas it favors the growth of a lush rainforest.

<doc id="201209" wikidata="Q383244" url="?curid=201209" title="Matthew Carter">
<text>Matthew Carter (born 1 October 1937) is a British type designer. A 2005 &quot;New Yorker&quot; profile described him as &#x27;the most widely read man in the world&#x27; by considering the amount of text set in his commonly used typefaces.

Carter&#x27;s career began in the early 1960s and has bridged all three major technologies used in type design: physical type, phototypesetting and digital type design, as well as the design of custom lettering.

Carter&#x27;s most used typefaces are the classic web typefaces Verdana and Georgia and the Windows interface typeface Tahoma, as well as other designs including Bell Centennial, Miller and Galliard. He is the son of the English historian of printing Harry Carter (1901–1982) and cofounded Bitstream, one of the first major retailers of digital typefaces. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Early life and education==

Carter grew up in London, the son of Harry Carter, a book designer and later historian of printing. His mother worked in preparing scale drawings.

Although Carter had intended to get a degree in English at Oxford he was advised to take a year off so he would be the same age as his contemporaries who had gone into National Service.

==Career==
=== Enschedé ===
Through his father, Carter arranged to hold an internship at the Joh. Enschedé type foundry in the Netherlands for a year. An extremely long-lasting company with a long history of printing, Enschedé had a history of creating conservative but popular book typefaces. Carter studied manual punchcutting, the method used to make moulds used to cast metal type, under P. H. Rädisch. Punchcutting was a traditional artisanal approach in decline many years before the 1950s. Carter is one of the last people in Europe formally trained in the technique as a living practice.

Carter enjoyed the experience, and decided to move directly into a career in graphic design and printing.

===London and New York===

Carter&#x27;s career in type and graphic design has bridged the transition from physical metal type to digital type.

Despite Carter&#x27;s training in the art of traditional punchcutting, his career developed at a time when metal type was rapidly being displaced by phototypesetting. This reduced the cost of designing and using a wide range of typefaces, since type could be stored on reels of film rather than as blocks of expensively engraved metal. In a book on Carter&#x27;s career, historian James Mosley, a few years older than Carter, would write of the period of their upbringing:
The Monotype classic [fonts] dominated the typographical landscape ... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type ... seemed at last to be happening.&#x27;
Carter eventually returned to London where he became a freelancer. By 1961 Carter was able to use the skills he acquired to cut his own version of the semi-bold typeface Dante. An early example of his work is the masthead logo he designed for the British magazine Private Eye in May 1962, still in use. Previously the lettering had been different for the masthead of each issue; it was based on a typeface (&#x27;a bit of nameless juvenilia&#x27;) which was never ultimately published. He also did early work for Heathrow Airport.

Carter would later become the typographic advisor to Crosfield Electronics, distributors of Photon phototypesetting machines. Carter designed many typefaces for Mergenthaler Linotype as well. Under Linotype, Carter created well-known typefaces including Snell Roundhand, a script typeface and Bell Centennial, intended for use in the Bell System&#x27;s phone directories and to celebrate its anniversary.

Based on the work of Robert Granjon, a 16th century French engraver, Carter created the sharp, high-contrast family Galliard. This matched a family interest: Carter&#x27;s father in the 1950s had indexed and examined original type by Granjon at the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp, and Carter had visited him several times to observe his progress. Carter&#x27;s adaptation, more intended for display use than for body text, included some eccentricities of Granjon&#x27;s original design, producing a result unlike many previous revivals of typefaces from the period. Carter wrote of his father&#x27;s research that it had helped to demonstrate &quot;that the finest collection of printing types made &quot;[by Christophe Plantin]&quot; in typography&#x27;s golden age was in perfect condition (some muddle aside) [along with] Plantin&#x27;s accounts and inventories which names the cutters of his types.&quot;

Carter also advised IBM as an independent consultant in the 1980s.

===Bitstream===

In 1981, Carter and his colleague Mike Parker created Bitstream Inc. This digital type foundry was one of the largest suppliers of type before its acquisition by Monotype in 2012. The company however did receive extensive criticism for its strategy of cheaply offering digitisations of pre-existing typefaces that it had not designed, often under alternative names (for example, Times New Roman as &#x27;Dutch 801&#x27;). While technically not illegal, this selling of large numbers of typefaces on CD would be described by type designer John Hudson as &quot;one of the worst instances of piracy in the history of type&quot;. In his role at Bitstream, Carter designed typefaces, such as Charter, and commissioned others such as Iowan Old Style from John Downer. Bitstream would ultimately be acquired by Monotype in 2012.

===Carter and Cone===
Carter left Bitstream in 1991 and in 1992 formed the Carter &amp; Cone type foundry with Cherie Cone. Carter&#x27;s recent typefaces have been published by a range of retailers including ITC, Font Bureau and Monotype, often in collaboration with Carter and Cone, together with his custom designs created for companies such as Microsoft.

Of Carter&#x27;s recent typefaces, the serif web typeface Georgia is inspired by Scotch Roman designs of the 19th century. It was based on designs for a print typeface in the same style Carter was working on when contacted by Microsoft; this would be released under the name Miller some years later. Speaking in 2013 about the development of Georgia and Miller, Carter said, &quot;I was familiar with Scotch romans, puzzled by the fact that they were once so popular ... and then they disappeared completely.&quot;

Many of Carter&#x27;s typefaces were created to address specific technical challenges, for example those posed by early computers. Charter was created to use a minimal number of design elements to fit in a small memory space on early computers, a problem that had expired even before he finished the design. The bold versions of Verdana and Georgia are also unusually bold, almost black. Carter noted that, &quot;Verdana and Georgia ... were all about binary bitmaps: every pixel was on or off, black or white ... The bold versions of Verdana and Georgia are bolder than most bolds, because on the screen, at the time we were doing this in the mid-1990s, if the stem wanted to be thicker than one pixel, it could only go to two pixels. That is a bigger jump in weight than is conventional in print series.&quot; Some of Carter&#x27;s early typeface digitizations would later be revisited: Monotype released an expanded version of Charter and Font Bureau expanded versions of Georgia, Verdana, Big Caslon and others. Earlier in his career, Bell Centennial was created to be legible in telephone directories, even when printed on cheap paper at small sizes.

Carter&#x27;s only typeface to bear his name is Carter Sans. It is a &#x27;glyphic&#x27; sans-serif with flaring towards the end of each letter. It was inspired by Albertus, a popular British typeface created by Berthold Wolpe for Monotype. Carter knew Wolpe early in his career and helped digitize one of his less-known typefaces for a 1980 retrospective of his work.
One of Carter&#x27;s more unusual projects was a typeface, Van Lanen, for the Hamilton Wood Type and Printing Museum. A &#x27;Latin&#x27;-style wedge serif typeface, it was released both in digital form and wood type. In an article on it, Carter noted that it has been &quot;50 years since a type of my design had been in a physical form that I could hold in my hand.&quot;
Carter has taught on Yale University&#x27;s graphic design programme since 1976. He also designed the university&#x27;s corporate typeface, Yale, at the request of John Gambell, the University Printer. Carter has said that this was the first time in designing a typeface that he focused more on capital than lowercase letters, since he knew that on the building signs the lettering would be in capitals. Carter wrote that:

The signs, whether free-standing or attached to walls, reminded me of inscriptions, and this led me to think about the inscriptional origins of Roman caps and the everlasting problem of reconciling capitals with lowercase. For me, the moment when the first true synthesis occurred was in the type of &quot;De Aetna&quot;. This led me in turn to the Beinecke Library to pore over their copy of the book and its type – the archetype of Roman type for me.

==Awards==
Carter has won numerous awards for his contributions to typography and design, including an &quot;honoris causa,&quot; Doctorate of Humane Letters from the Art Institute of Boston, an medal in 1995, the TDC Medal from the Type Directors Club in 1997, and the 2005 Typography Award. A retrospective of his work, &quot;Typographically Speaking, The Art of Matthew Carter,&quot; was exhibited at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in December 2002. This retrospective is featured in the documentary, &quot;Typographically Speaking: A Conversation With Matthew Carter.&quot; In 2010, Carter was named a MacArthur Foundation Fellow, otherwise known as a &quot;genius&quot; grant. 

On 26 May 2011, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Design Awards at the White House.

He is a member of Alliance Graphique Internationale (), has served as chairman of ATypI, is a member of the board of directors of the Type Directors Club, and is an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the board of directors of the Society of Typographic Aficionados. Some of Carter&#x27;s designs are in the collection of the St. Bride Printing Library in London.

Carter was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to typography and design.

<text>Elsa Brändström (26 March 1888 – 4 March 1948) was a Swedish nurse and philanthropist. She was known as the &quot;Angel of Siberia&quot; ().

== Life and commitment ==

Elsa Brändström was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia. She was the daughter of the Military Attaché at the Swedish Embassy, Edvard Brändström (1850–1921) and his wife Anna Wilhelmina Eschelsson (1855–1913). In 1891, when she was three years old, the family returned to Sweden. In 1906, Brändström, now a general, became the Swedish Ambassador at the court of Tsar Nicholas II and returned to Saint Petersburg.

Elsa spent her childhood in Linköping in Sweden. From 1906 to 1908, she studied at Anna Sandström Teachers Training College (&quot;Anna Sandströms högre lärarinneseminarium&quot;) in Stockholm but returned to St. Petersburg in 1908. Her mother died in 1913. Elsa was in St. Petersburg at the outbreak of World War I and volunteered for a position as a nurse in the Imperial Russian Army.

=== World War I ===
In 1915, Brändström went to Siberia together with her friend and nurse Ethel von Heidenstam (1881–1970) for the Swedish Red Cross, to introduce basic medical treatment for the German and Austrian POWs. Up to 80 percent of the POWs died of cold, hunger and diseases. As Brändström visited the first camp and witnessed the inhumane situation, she decided to dedicate her life to these soldiers. For the dedication with which she looked after men from Germany and Austria, many close to death with Typhoid fever, she became known as the &quot;Angel of Siberia&quot;.

Back in St. Petersburg, she founded a Swedish Aid organisation but her work was severely hindered by the 1917 Russian Revolution and the Bolshevik coup. In 1918, the new Soviet Russian authorities withdrew her work permit, but she did not give up and made several trips to Siberia until being arrested in Omsk in 1920. Accused of being a spy, Brändström was initially sentenced to death by the Soviet authorities. The sentence was eventually revoked and she was interned in 1920. After her release, she returned to Sweden via Stettin on the ship &quot;MS Lisboa&quot;, where the German government gave her an official public reception. Upon returning to Sweden Brändström organised fund-raising for former POWs and their families. Afterwards she emigrated to Germany.

=== Peacetime ===
In 1922, her book was published. It was later translated and published as &quot;Among prisoners of war in Russia &amp; Siberia&quot; (London: Hutchinson. 1929). From then onwards she looked after former POWs in a rehabilitation sanatorium for homecoming German soldiers at Marienborn-Schmeckwitz in Saxony. She bought a mill named Schreibermühle close to Lychen in Uckermark and used it as re-socialization centre for former POWs. Schreibermühle had extensive lands including fields, forest and meadows on which potatoes and other crops could be grown. This was most useful at that time because the German Mark was an unstable currency and lost value from day to day.

In 1923, she undertook a six-month tour in the United States, giving lectures to raise money for a new home for children of deceased and traumatised German and Austrian POWs. On her trip she raised US$100,000 and traveled to 65 towns. At a stop at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota, Brändström wore clothing of the Swedish Red Cross and &quot;spoke about her thrilling experiences in Russia and Siberia during and after the war.&quot;

In January 1924, she founded a children&#x27;s home, Neusorge, in Mittweida, which had room for more than 200 orphans and children in need. In Siberia she had promised many German soldiers, who were dying, that she would care for their children.

In 1929 she married her great love Heinrich Gottlob Robert Ulich, a German professor of Pedagogy. Afterwards, she moved together with him to Dresden. In 1931, she sold the Schreibermühle and donated her other home, &quot;Neusorge&quot;, to the Welfare Centre in Leipzig. She founded the Elsa Brändström Foundation for Women, which awarded scholarships to children from Neusorge. On 3 January 1932, her daughter Brita was born in Dresden.
In 1933, Robert Ulich accepted a lectureship at Harvard University and in consequence the family moved to the United States. Here Brandström gave aid to newly arrived German and Austrian refugees. In 1939, she opened the Window Shop, a restaurant which gave work opportunities for refugees in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

=== World War II ===
At the end of World War II, she started to raise funds for starving and shelterless women and children in need in Germany through the organisations CARE International (Co-operative for American Relief in Europe) and CRALOG (Council of Relief Agencies Licensed for Operation in Germany). Sizable funds were collected from Americans and especially from German Americans, who accounted for over 25% of the American population. She undertook a final lecture tour in Europe on behalf of the &quot;Save the Children Fund&quot;.


== Death ==
Brändström could not undertake her last planned journey to Germany because of illness. She died in 1948 of bone cancer in Cambridge, Massachusetts at the age of 59. While her daughter Brita stayed with her husband and children in the U.S., her husband Robert returned to Germany, where he died in 1977 at Stuttgart.

== Honours and memory ==
Because of her commitment to POWs, Brändström became famous as a &quot;patron saint&quot; for soldiers. In Germany and Austria, many streets, schools and institutions are named after her.

:&quot;The war has brought about many heroines in various nations, but in my opinion, never again someone, who is more worthy of being honoured than Elsa Brändström.&quot; – General Alfred Knox, British Military Attaché in Russia.

Among countless medals, awards and honours, Brändström was awarded the &quot;Silber Badge of the German Empire&quot; () and the Golden Seraphim Medal (). She was awarded the Illis quorum in 1920. Brändström was also nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize &quot;Heroine of Peace&quot; five times: in 1922, twice in 1923, 1928 and 1929.

=== In memory of Brändström ===
A ceremony at Arne-Karlsson-Park in Vienna on 16 September 1965 preceded the official opening of the XXth International Conference of the Red Cross. In the presence of Austrian civilian and military authorities, members of the Swedish colony, leaders of the Austrian Red Cross and many conference delegates, a monument to Elsa Brändström was unveiled. This monument, by the sculptor Robert Ullmann, stands as a testimony of gratitude to the famous Swedish nurse&#x27;s work for German-Austrian prisoners during the First World War.

<doc id="201211" wikidata="Q757081" url="?curid=201211" title="Indomalayan realm">
<text>The Indomalayan realm is one of the eight biogeographic realms. It extends across most of South and Southeast Asia and into the southern parts of East Asia.

Also called the Oriental realm by biogeographers, Indomalaya spreads all over the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia to lowland southern China, and through Indonesia as far as Sumatra, Java, Bali, and Borneo, east of which lies the Wallace line, the realm boundary named after Alfred Russel Wallace which separates Indomalaya from Australasia. Indomalaya also includes the Philippines, lowland Taiwan, and Japan&#x27;s Ryukyu Islands.

Most of Indomalaya was originally covered by forest, and includes tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, with tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests predominant in much of India and parts of Southeast Asia. The tropical forests of Indomalaya are highly variable and diverse, with economically important trees, especially in the families Dipterocarpaceae and Fabaceae.

== Major ecological regions ==

The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) divides Indomalayan realm into three bio-regions, which it defines as &quot;geographic clusters of eco-regions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family)&quot;.

=== Indian subcontinent ===
The Indian subcontinent bioregion covers most of India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka and eastern parts of Pakistan. The Hindu Kush, Karakoram, Himalaya, and Patkai ranges bound the bioregion on the northwest, north, and northeast; these ranges were formed by the collision of the northward-drifting Indian subcontinent with Asia beginning 45 million years ago. The Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Himalaya are a major biogeographic boundary between the subtropical and tropical flora and fauna of the Indian subcontinent and the temperate-climate Palearctic realm.

=== Indochina ===
The Indochina bioregion includes most of mainland Southeast Asia, including Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia, as well as the subtropical forests of southern China.

=== Sunda Shelf and the Philippines ===

Malesia is a botanical province which straddles the boundary between Indomalaya and Australasia. It includes the Malay Peninsula and the western Indonesian islands (known as Sundaland), the Philippines, the eastern Indonesian islands, and New Guinea. While the Malesia has much in common botanically, the portions east and west of the Wallace Line differ greatly in land animal species; Sundaland shares its fauna with mainland Asia, while terrestrial fauna on the islands east of the Wallace line are derived at least in part from species of Australian origin, such as marsupial mammals and ratite birds.

== History ==
The flora of Indomalaya blends elements from the ancient supercontinents of Laurasia and Gondwana. Gondwanian elements were first introduced by India, which detached from Gondwana approximately 90 MYA, carrying its Gondwana-derived flora and fauna northward, which included cichlid fish and the plant families Crypteroniaceae and possibly Dipterocarpaceae. India collided with Asia 30-45 MYA, and exchanged species. Later, as Australia-New Guinea drifted north, the collision of the Australian and Asian plates pushed up the islands of Wallacea, which were separated from one another by narrow straits, allowing a botanic exchange between Indomalaya and Australasia. Asian rainforest flora, including the dipterocarps, island-hopped across Wallacea to New Guinea, and several Gondwanian plant families, including podocarps and araucarias, moved westward from Australia-New Guinea into western Malesia and Southeast Asia.

== Flora ==
The subfamily Dipterocarpoideae comprises characteristic tree species in Indomalaya&#x27;s moist and seasonally dry forests, with the greatest species diversity in the moist forests of Borneo. Teak (&quot;Tectona&quot;) is characteristic of the seasonally dry forests of the Indomalaya, from India through Indochina, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Tropical pitcher plants (&quot;Nepenthes&quot;) are also characteristic of Indomalaya, and the greatest diversity of species is in Sumatra, Borneo, and the Philippines.

The tropical forests of Indomalaya and Australasia share many lineages of plants, which have managed over millions of years to disperse across the straits and islands between Sundaland and New Guinea. The two floras evolved in long isolation, and the fossil record suggests that Asian species dispersed to Australasia starting 33 million years ago as Australasia moved northwards, and dispersal increased 12 million years ago as the two continents approached their present positions. The exchange was asymmetric, with more Indomalayan species spreading to Australasia than Australasian species to Indomalaya.

== Fauna ==
Two orders of mammals, the colugos (Dermoptera) and treeshrews (Scandentia), are endemic to the realm, as are families Craseonycteridae (Kitti&#x27;s hog-nosed bat), Diatomyidae, Platacanthomyidae, Tarsiidae (tarsiers) and Hylobatidae (gibbons). Large mammals characteristic of Indomalaya include the leopard, tigers, water buffalos, Asian elephant, Indian rhinoceros, Javan rhinoceros, Malayan tapir, orangutans, and gibbons.

Indomalaya has three endemic bird families, the Irenidae (fairy bluebirds), Megalaimidae and Rhabdornithidae (Philippine creepers). Also characteristic are pheasants, pittas, Old World babblers, and flowerpeckers.

Indomalaya has 1000 species of amphibians in 81 genera, about 17 of global species. 800 Indomalayan species, or 80%, are endemic. Indomalaya has three endemic families of amphibians, Nasikabatrachidae, Ichthyophiidae, and Uraeotyphlidae. 329, or 33%, of Indomalayan amphibians are considered threatened or extinct, with habitat loss as the principal cause.

More information is available under Indomalayan realm fauna.

<doc id="201212" wikidata="Q1077944" url="?curid=201212" title="Australasian realm">
<text>The Australasian realm is one of eight biogeographic realms that is coincident with, but not (by some definitions) the same as, the geographical region of Australasia. The realm includes Australia, the island of New Guinea (comprising Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian province of Papua), and the eastern part of the Indonesian archipelago, including the island of Sulawesi, the Moluccas (the Indonesian provinces of Maluku and North Maluku), and the islands of Lombok, Sumbawa, Sumba, Flores, and Timor, often known as the Lesser Sundas.

The Australasian realm also includes several Pacific island groups, including the Bismarck Archipelago, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and New Caledonia. New Zealand and its surrounding islands are a distinctive sub-region of the Australasian realm. The rest of Indonesia is part of the Indomalayan realm. In the classification scheme developed by Miklos Udvardy, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands and New Zealand are placed in the Oceanian realm.

==Geography==
From an ecological perspective the Australasian realm is a distinct region, parts of which have a common geologic and evolutionary history. The entire area has experienced a long period of biological isolation from other regions, and thus harbors a great many unique plants and animals. In this context, Australasia is limited to Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, New Caledonia, and neighbouring islands, including the Indonesian islands from Lombok and Sulawesi eastward. 

The Wallace Line to the west divides areas in the Indomalayan realm of tropical Asia which are or have at times been directly connected to the Asian mainland from islands that have never been so connected. Borneo and Bali lie on the western, Asian side. A second biological dividing line is Lydekker&#x27;s Line, which similarly separates islands isolated by surrounding deep water from those associated with the Sahul Shelf of the Australian continent. Islands between the two lines (e.g. Sulawesi, the Moluccas and Lombok through Timor) form the biogeographical area of Wallacea, a transition zone between the Indomalayan and Australasian realms populated entirely by aerial or oceanic dispersal (although defined here as part of the Australasian realm).

==Geology==
Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia are all fragments of the ancient supercontinent Gondwana, the marks of which are still visible in the Christmas Island Seamount Province and other geophysical entities. These three land masses have been separated from other continents, and from one another, for tens millions of years. All of Australasia shares the Antarctic flora, although the northern, tropical islands also share many plants with Southeast Asia.

Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania are separated from one another by shallow continental shelves, and were linked together when the sea level was lower during ice ages. They share a similar fauna which includes marsupial and monotreme mammals and ratite birds. Eucalypts are the predominant trees in much of Australia and New Guinea. New Zealand has no native land mammals, but also had ratite birds, including the kiwi and the moa. The Australasian realm includes some nearby island groups, like Wallacea, the Bismarck Archipelago, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, which were not formerly part of Gondwana, but which share many characteristic plants and animals with Australasia.

==Ecology==
Note that this zonation is based on flora; animals do not necessarily follow the same biogeographic boundaries. In the present case, many birds occur in both &quot;Indomalayan&quot; and &quot;Australasian&quot; regions, but not across the whole of either. On the other hand, there are few faunistic commonalities shared only by Australia and New Zealand, except some birds. Meanwhile, Australia, Melanesia and the Wallacea are united by a large share of similar animals, but few of these occur farther into the Pacific. On the other hand, much of the Polynesian fauna is related to that of Melanesia.

<text>The Oceanian realm is one of the eight biogeographic realms and is unique in not including any continental land mass. It has the smallest land area of any of the WWF realms.

This realm includes the islands of the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, the Fijian Islands, the Hawaiian Islands, and Polynesia (with the exception of New Zealand). New Zealand, Australia, and most of Melanesia including New Guinea, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and New Caledonia are included within the Australasian realm.

Conversely, New Guinea, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands and New Zealand are included in the Oceanian realm in the classification scheme developed by Miklos Udvardy in 1975.

The Juan Fernández Islands have been included in both the Oceanian and Temperate South American realms. Despite only being a few hundred miles removed from the South American coast, the islands have strong Hawaiian and southeast Polynesian biogeographic influences, and the presence of an endemic insect and plant family. The uninhabited French territory of Clipperton Island, 1,000 kilometers off the coast of Mexico, has also been associated with the realm.

==Geology==
Oceania is geologically the youngest realm. While other realms include old continental land masses or fragments of continents, Oceania is composed mostly of volcanic high islands and coral atolls that arose from the sea in geologically recent times, many of them in the Pleistocene. They were created either by hotspot volcanism, or as island arcs pushed upward by the collision and subduction of tectonic plates. The islands range from tiny islets, sea stacks and coral atolls to large mountainous islands, like Hawaii and Fiji.

==Climate==

The climate of Oceania&#x27;s islands is tropical or subtropical, and range from humid to seasonally dry. Wetter parts of the islands are covered by tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, while the drier parts of the islands, including the leeward sides of the islands and many of the low coral islands, are covered by tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests and Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands. Hawaii&#x27;s high volcanoes, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, are home to some rare tropical montane grasslands and shrublands.

==Flora and fauna==

Since the islands of Oceania were never connected by land to a continent, the flora and fauna of the islands originally reached them from across the ocean (though at the height of the last ice age sea levels were much lower than today and many current seamounts were islands, so some now isolated islands were once less isolated). Once they reached the islands, the ancestors of Oceania&#x27;s present flora and fauna adapted to life on the islands.

Larger islands with diverse ecological niches encouraged floral and faunal adaptive radiation, whereby multiple species evolved from a common ancestor, each species adapted to a different ecological niche; the various species of Hawaiian honeycreepers (Family &quot;Drepanididae&quot;) are a classic example. Other adaptations to island ecologies include gigantism, dwarfism, and among birds, loss of flight. Oceania has a number of endemic species; Hawaii in particular is considered a global center of endemism, with its forest ecoregions having one of the highest percentages of endemic plants in the world.

===Flora===

Land plants disperse by several different means. Many plants, mostly ferns and mosses but also some flowering plants, disperse on the wind, relying on tiny spores or feathery seeds that can remain airborne over long distances notably &quot;Metrosideros&quot; trees from New Zealand spread on the wind across Oceania. Other plants, notably coconut palms and mangroves, produce seeds that can float in salt water over long distances, eventually washing up on distant beaches, and thus &quot;Cocos&quot; trees are ubiquitous across Oceania. Birds are also an important means of dispersal; some plants produce sticky seeds that are carried on the feet or feathers of birds, and many plants produce fruits with seeds that can pass through the digestive tracts of birds. &quot;Pandanus&quot; trees are fairly ubiquitous across Oceania.

Botanists generally agree that much of the flora of Oceania is derived from the Malesian Flora of the Malay Peninsula, Indonesia, the Philippines, and New Guinea, with some plants from Australasia and a few from the Americas, particularly in Hawaii. Easter Island has some plants from South America such as the totora reed.

===Fauna===

Dispersal across the ocean is difficult for most land animals, and Oceania has relatively few indigenous land animals compared to other realms. Certain types of animals that are ecologically important on the continental realms, like large land predators and grazing mammals, were entirely absent from the islands of Oceania until humans brought them. Birds are relatively common, including many seabirds and some species of land birds whose ancestors may have been blown out to sea by storms. Some birds evolved into flightless species after their ancestors arrived, including several species of rails. A number of islands have indigenous lizards, including geckoes and skinks, whose ancestors probably arrived on floating rafts of vegetation washed out to sea by storms. With the exception of bats, which live on most of the island groups, there are few if any indigenous non-marine mammals in Oceania.

==Impact of settlement==

Many animal and plant species have been introduced by humans in two main waves.

Malayo-Polynesian settlers brought pigs, dogs, chickens and polynesian rats to many islands; and had spread across the whole of Oceania by 1200 CE. From the seventeenth century onwards European settlers brought other animals, including cats, cattle, horses, small Asian mongoose (&quot;Herpestes javanicus&quot;), sheep, goats, and the brown rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;). These and other introduced species, in addition to overhunting and deforestation, have dramatically altered the ecology of many of Oceania&#x27;s islands, pushing many species to extinction or near-extinction, or confining them to small islets uninhabited by humans.

The absence of predator species caused many bird species to lose the instinct to flee from predators and to lay their eggs on the ground, which makes them vulnerable to predators such as cats, dogs, mongooses or rats. The arrival of humans on these island groups often resulted in disruption of the indigenous ecosystems and waves of species extinctions (see Holocene extinction event). Easter Island, the easternmost island in Polynesia, shows evidence of ecosystem collapse, probably caused by human activity, several hundred years ago, which contributed (along with slave raiding and European diseases) to a 99% decline in the human population of the island. The island, once lushly forested, is now mostly windswept grassland. More recently, Guam&#x27;s native bird and lizard species were decimated after the introduction of the brown tree snake (&quot;Boiga irregularis&quot;) in the 1940s.

<doc id="201220" wikidata="Q319531" url="?curid=201220" title="Azuchi–Momoyama period">
<text>The was the final phase of the in Japanese history from 1568 to 1600.

After the outbreak of the Ōnin War in 1467, the power of the Ashikaga Shogunate effectively collapsed, marking the start of the chaotic Sengoku period. In 1568, Oda Nobunaga entered Kyoto to install Ashikaga Yoshiaki as the 15th and ultimately final Ashikaga &quot;shōgun&quot;. This entrance marked the start of the Azuchi-Momoyama period.

Nobunaga overthrew Yoshiaki and dissolved the Ashikaga Shogunate in 1573, launching a war of conquest to politically unify Japan by force from his base in Azuchi. Nobunaga was forced to commit suicide in the Honnō-ji Incident in 1582. His successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi completed Nobunaga&#x27;s campaign of unification and enacted reforms to consolidate his rule, marking the end of the Sengoku period. Hideyoshi launched the Japanese invasions of Korea in 1592, but their failure damaged his prestige, and his young son and successor Toyotomi Hideyori was challenged by Tokugawa Ieyasu after Hideyoshi&#x27;s death in 1598.

The Azuchi–Momoyama period ended with the Tokugawa victory at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 – unofficially establishing the Tokugawa Shogunate and beginning the Edo period. The Azuchi–Momoyama period encompassed the transition of Japanese society from the pre-modern to the early modern period. The Azuchi–Momoyama period is named after Nobunaga&#x27;s Azuchi Castle and Hideyoshi&#x27;s Momoyama Castle, and is also known as the in some Japanese texts, abridged from the surnames of the period&#x27;s two leaders in on-yomi: for plus for .

==Oda Nobunaga begins unification==
During the last half of the 16th century, a number of &quot;daimyōs&quot; became strong enough either to manipulate the Ashikaga shogunate to their own advantage or to overthrow it altogether. One attempt to overthrow the &quot;bakufu&quot; (the Japanese term for the shogunate) was made in 1560 by Imagawa Yoshimoto, whose march towards the capital came to an ignominious end at the hands of Oda Nobunaga in the Battle of Okehazama. In 1562, the Tokugawa clan who was adjacent to the east of Nobunaga&#x27;s territory became independent of the Imagawa clan, and allied with Nobunaga. The eastern territory of Nobunaga was not invaded by this alliance. He then moved his army west. In 1565, an alliance of the Matsunaga and Miyoshi clans attempted a coup by assassinating Ashikaga Yoshiteru, the 13th Ashikaga &quot;shōgun&quot;. Internal squabbling, however, prevented them from acting swiftly to legitimatize their claim to power, and it was not until 1568 that they managed to install Yoshiteru&#x27;s cousin, Ashikaga Yoshihide, as the next &quot;shōgun&quot;. Failure to enter Kyoto and gain recognition from the imperial court, however, had left the succession in doubt, and a group of &quot;bakufu&quot; retainers led by Hosokawa Fujitaka negotiated with Nobunaga to gain support for Yoshiteru&#x27;s younger brother, Yoshiaki.

Nobunaga, who had prepared over a period of years for just such an opportunity by establishing an alliance with the Azai clan in northern Ōmi Province and then conquering the neighboring Mino Province, now marched toward Kyoto. After routing the Rokkaku clan in southern Ōmi, Nobunaga forced the Matsunaga to capitulate and the Miyoshi to withdraw to Settsu. He then entered the capital, where he successfully gained recognition from the emperor for Yoshiaki, who became the 15th and last Ashikaga &quot;shōgun&quot;.

Nobunaga had no intention, however, of serving the Muromachi &quot;bakufu&quot;, and instead now turned his attention to tightening his grip on the Kinai region. Resistance in the form of rival &quot;daimyōs&quot;, intransigent Buddhist monks, and hostile merchants was eliminated swiftly and mercilessly, and Nobunaga quickly gained a reputation as a ruthless, unrelenting adversary. In support of his political and military moves, he instituted economic reform, removing barriers to commerce by invalidating traditional monopolies held by shrines and guilds and promoting initiative by instituting free markets known as &quot;rakuichi-rakuza&quot;.

The newly installed &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshiaki also was extremely wary of his powerful nominal retainer Nobunaga, and immediately began plotting against him by forming a wide alliance of nearly every &quot;daimyō&quot; adjacent to the Oda realm. This included Oda&#x27;s close ally and brother in-law Azai Nagamasa, the supremely powerful Takeda Shingen, as well as the monk warriors from the Tendai Buddhists monastic center at Mount Hiei near Kyoto (who became the first major casualty of this war as it was completely destroyed by Nobunaga).

As the Oda army was bogged down by fighting on every corner, Takeda Shingen led what was by then widely considered as the most powerful army in Japan and marched towards the Oda home base of Owari, easily crushing Nobunaga&#x27;s young ally and future &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu in the Battle of Mikatagahara in 1573.

However, as the Takeda army was on the cusp of obliterating the Oda–Tokugawa alliance, Takeda Shingen suddenly perished, under mysterious circumstances. (Multiple suggestions for his demise include battlefield death from marksman, ninja assassination, and stomach cancer.) Having suddenly lost their leader, the Takeda army quickly retreated back to their home base in Kai Province.

With the death of Takeda Shingen in early 1573, the &quot;Anti-Oda Alliance&quot; that Ashikaga Yoshiaki created quickly crumbled as Nobunaga destroyed the alliance of the Asakura clan and Azai clan that threatened his northern flank, and soon after expelled the &quot;shōgun&quot; himself from Kyoto.

Even after Shingen&#x27;s death, there remained several &quot;daimyōs&quot; powerful enough to resist Nobunaga, but none were situated close enough to Kyoto to pose a threat politically, and it appeared that unification under the Oda banner was a matter of time.

Nobunaga&#x27;s enemies were not only other &quot;daimyōs&quot; but also adherents of a Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism who were of the &quot;Ikkō-ikki&quot; faction, led by Kōsa. He endured though Nobunaga kept attacking his fortress for ten years. Nobunaga expelled Kennyo in the eleventh year, but, through a riot caused by Kennyo, Nobunaga&#x27;s territory took the bulk of the damage. This long war was called the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War.

Nobunaga was highly interested in foreign cultures, especially those of western Europe. A significant amount of Western Christian culture was introduced to Japan by missionaries from Europe. From this exposure, Japan received new foods, a new drawing method, astronomy, geography, medical science, and new printing techniques. Most critically, trade with Europe provided Nobunaga&#x27;s armies with new weapons, among them the matchlock rifle or arquebus.

Nobunaga decided to reduce the power of the Buddhist monasteries, and gave protection to Christianity, although he never converted to Christianity himself. He slaughtered many Buddhist priests who resisted him, and burned their fortified temples.

The activities of European traders and Catholic missionaries (Alessandro Valignano, Luís Fróis, Gnecchi-Soldo Organtino) in Japan saw one of the earliest relatively numerous increase of Europeans into the region.

During the period from 1576 to 1579, Nobunaga constructed, on the shore of Lake Biwa at Azuchi, Azuchi Castle, a magnificent seven-story castle that was intended to serve not simply as an impregnable military fortification, but also as a sumptuous residence that would stand as a symbol of unification.

Having secured his grip on the Kinai region, Nobunaga was now powerful enough to assign his generals the task of subjugating the outlying provinces. Shibata Katsuie was given the task of conquering the Uesugi clan in Etchū, Takigawa Kazumasu confronted the Shinano Province that a son of Shingen, Takeda Katsuyori governed, and Hashiba Hideyoshi was given the formidable task of facing the Mōri clan in the Chūgoku region of western Honshū.

In 1575, Nobunaga won a significant victory over the Takeda clan in the Battle of Nagashino. Despite the strong reputation of Takeda&#x27;s samurai cavalry, Oda Nobunaga embraced the relatively new technology of the arquebus, and inflicted a crushing defeat. The legacy of this battle forced a complete overhaul of traditional Japanese warfare.

In 1582, after a protracted campaign, Hideyoshi requested Nobunaga&#x27;s help in overcoming the resistance of the Mōri clan. Nobunaga, making a stop-over in Kyoto on his way west with only a small contingent of guards, was attacked by one of his own disaffected generals, Akechi Mitsuhide, and committed suicide.

==Hideyoshi completes the unification==

What followed was a scramble by the most powerful of Nobunaga&#x27;s retainers to avenge their lord&#x27;s death and thereby establish a dominant position in negotiations over the forthcoming realignment of the Oda clan. The situation became even more urgent when it was made known that Nobunaga&#x27;s oldest son and heir, Nobutada, killed himself, leaving the Oda clan with no clear successor.

Quickly negotiating a truce with the Mōri clan before they could learn of Nobunaga&#x27;s death, Hideyoshi now took his troops on a forced march toward his adversary, whom he defeated at the Battle of Yamazaki less than two weeks later.

Although a commoner who had risen through the ranks from foot soldier, Hideyoshi was now in a position to challenge even the most senior of the Oda clan&#x27;s hereditary retainers, and proposed that Nobutada&#x27;s infant son, Sanpōshi (who became Oda Hidenobu), be named heir rather than Nobunaga&#x27;s adult third son, Nobutaka, whose cause had been championed by Shibata Katsuie. Having gained the support of other senior retainers, including Niwa Nagahide and Ikeda Tsuneoki, Sanpōshi was named heir and Hideyoshi appointed co-guardian.

Continued political intrigue, however, eventually led to open confrontation. After defeating Shibata at the Battle of Shizugatake in 1583 and enduring a costly but ultimately advantageous stalemate with Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute in 1584, Hideyoshi managed to settle the question of succession for once and all, to take complete control of Kyoto, and to become the undisputed ruler of the former Oda domains. The &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Shikoku Chōsokabe clan surrendered to Hideyoshi in July, 1585, and the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kyushu Shimazu clan also surrendered two years later. He was adopted by the Fujiwara clan, given the surname Toyotomi, and granted the superlative title &quot;kanpaku&quot;, representing civil and military control of all Japan. By the following year, he had secured alliances with three of the nine major &quot;daimyō&quot; coalitions and carried the war of unification to Shikoku and Kyushu. In 1590, at the head of an army of 200,000, Hideyoshi defeated the Later Hōjō clan, his last formidable rival in eastern Honshū in the siege of Odawara. The remaining &quot;daimyō&quot; soon capitulated, and the military reunification of Japan was complete.

==Japan under Hideyoshi==

===Land survey===
With all of Japan now under Hideyoshi&#x27;s control, a new structure for national government was set up. The country was unified under a single leader, but daily governance remained decentralized. The basis of power was distribution of territory as measured by rice production, in units of &quot;koku&quot;. A national survey from 1598 was instituted, with assessments showing the national rice production at 18.5 million &quot;koku&quot;, 2 million of which was controlled directly by Hideyoshi himself. In contrast, Tokugawa Ieyasu, whom Hideyoshi had transferred to the Kanto region, held 2.5 million &quot;koku&quot;. The surveys, carried out by Hideyoshi both before and after he took the title of &quot;taikō&quot;, have come to be known as the &quot;Taikō surveys&quot; (&quot;Taikō kenchi&quot;).

===Control measures===

A number of other administrative innovations were instituted to encourage commerce and stabilize society. In order to facilitate transportation, toll booths and other checkpoints along roads were largely eliminated, as were unnecessary military strongholds. Measures that effectively froze class distinctions were instituted, including the requirement that different classes live separately in different areas of a town and a prohibition on the carrying or ownership of weapons by farmers. Hideyoshi ordered the collection of weapons in a great &quot;sword hunt&quot; (&quot;katanagari&quot;).

====Prosecution of Christians====

In 1586, Hideyoshi conquered Kyushu in the Kyushu Campaign (1586-1587) from the Shimazu clan. In 1587, Hideyoshi increased control over the &quot;Kirishitan&quot; daimyos by banishing Christian missionaries from Kyūshū.
In January 1597, Hideyoshi ordered the arrest of twenty-six Christians to warn Japanese who thought about converting to Christianity. They were tortured, mutilated, paraded through towns and crucified in Nagasaki. This became known as the 26 Martyrs of Japan. These measures severely curbed Christianity and foreign influence in Japan.

===Unification===
Hideyoshi sought to secure his position by rearranging the holdings of the &quot;daimyōs&quot; to his advantage. In particular, he reassigned the Tokugawa family to the Kanto region, far from the capital, and surrounded their new territory with
more trusted vassals. He also adopted a hostage system, in which the wives and heirs of &quot;daimyōs&quot; resided at his castle town in Osaka.

Hideyoshi attempted to provide for an orderly succession by taking the title &quot;taikō&quot;, or &quot;retired Kanpaku (Imperial regent)&quot;, in 1591, and turned the regency over to his nephew and adopted son Toyotomi Hidetsugu. Only later did he attempt to formalize the balance of power by establishing administrative bodies. These included the Council of Five Elders, who were sworn to keep peace and support the Toyotomi, the five-member Board of House Administrators, who handled routine policy and administrative matters, and the three-member Board of Mediators, who were charged with keeping peace between the first two boards.

=== Korean campaigns ===
Hideyoshi&#x27;s last major ambition was to conquer the Ming dynasty of China. In April 1592, after having been refused safe passage through Korea, Hideyoshi sent an army of 200,000 to invade and pass through Korea by force. During the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), the Japanese occupied Seoul by May 1592, and within three months of the invasion, the Japanese reached Pyongyang. King Seonjo of Joseon fled, and two Korean princes were captured by Katō Kiyomasa. Seonjo dispatched an emissary to the Ming court, asking urgently for military assistance. The Chinese emperor sent admiral Chen Lin and commander Li Rusong to aid the Koreans. Commander Li pushed the Japanese out of the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. The Japanese were forced to withdraw as far as the southern part of the Korean peninsula by January 1593, and counterattacked Li Rusong. This combat reached a stalemate, and Japan and China eventually entered peace talks.

During the peace talks that ensued between 1593 and 1597, Hideyoshi, seeing Japan as an equal of Ming China, demanded a division of Korea, free-trade status, and a Chinese princess as consort for the emperor. The Joseon and Chinese leaders saw no reason to concede to such demands, nor to treat the invaders as equals within the Ming trading system. Japan&#x27;s requests were thus denied and peace efforts reached an impasse.

A second invasion of Korea began in 1597, but it too resulted in failure as Japanese forces met with better organized Korean defenses especially under Admiral Yi Sun-sin of the Korean navy and an increasing Chinese involvement in the conflict. Upon the death of Hideyoshi in 1598, his designated successor Toyotomi Hideyori was only 5 years old. As such, the domestic political situation in Japan became unstable, making continuation of the war difficult and causing the Japanese to withdraw from Korea. At this stage, most of the remaining Japanese commanders were more concerned about internal battles and the inevitable struggles for the control of the shogunate.

== Establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate ==
Hideyoshi had on his deathbed appointed a group of the most powerful lords in Japan—Tokugawa, Maeda, Ukita, Uesugi, and Mōri, to govern as the Council of Five Elders until his infant son, Hideyori, came of age. An uneasy peace lasted until the death of Maeda Toshiie in 1599. Thereafter, Ishida Mitsunari accused Ieyasu of disloyalty to the Toyotomi name, precipitating a crisis that led to the Battle of Sekigahara. Generally regarded as the last major conflict of both the Azuchi–Momoyama and the Sengoku period, Ieyasu&#x27;s victory at Sekigahara marked the end of Toyotomi&#x27;s reign. Three years later, Ieyasu received the title &quot;Sei-i Tai-shōgun&quot;, and established the Edo &quot;bakufu&quot;, which lasted until the Meiji Restoration in 1868.

==Social and commercial developments==
The period saw the development of large urban centers and the rise of the merchant class. The ornate castle architecture and interiors adorned with painted screens embellished with gold leaf were a reflection of a &quot;daimyō&quot;″s power but also exhibited a new aesthetic sense that marked a clear departure from the somber monotones favored during the Muromachi period. A genre that emerged at this time was called the &quot;Nanban&quot; style—exotic depictions of European priests, traders, and other &quot;southern barbarians&quot;.

The art of the tea ceremony also flourished at this time, and both Nobunaga and Hideyoshi lavished time and money on this pastime, collecting tea bowls, caddies, and other implements, sponsoring lavish social events, and patronizing acclaimed masters such as Sen no Rikyū.

Hideyoshi had occupied Nagasaki in 1587, and thereafter sought to take control of international trade and to regulate the trade associations that had contact with the outside world through this port. Although China rebuffed his efforts to secure trade concessions, Hideyoshi&#x27;s commercial missions successfully called upon present-day Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand in red seal ships. He was also suspicious of Christianity in Japan, which he saw as potentially subversive, and some missionaries were crucified by his regime.

<text>Matti Pellonpää (28 March 1951 in Helsinki – 13 July 1995 in Vaasa) was a Finnish actor and a musician. He rose to international fame with his roles in both Aki Kaurismäki&#x27;s and Mika Kaurismäki&#x27;s films; particularly being a regular in Aki&#x27;s films, appearing in 18 of them.

==Career==
He started his career in 1962 as a radio actor at the Finnish state-owned broadcasting company YLE. He performed as an actor during the 1970s in many amateur theatres, at the same time that he studied at the Finnish Theatre Academy, where he completed his studies in the year 1977.

He was nominated Best Actor by European Film Academy for his role as Rodolfo in &quot;La Vie de Boheme&quot; and won the Felix at the European Film Awards in 1992. He also starred in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;Night on Earth&quot;.

His private life melded seamlessly with his acting work. He was considered a natural bohemian, and a genuine everyman without ego. He frequently used his own life as a basis for his acting, eschewing wardrobe provided, acting in his own clothes. He had a tattoo of Snoopy on his left bicep.

Pellonpää was the frontman for the band &quot;Peltsix&quot; (1989–1995). Peltsix gained cult following with its tragic, and at the same time, comic songs. Peltsix&#x27;s songs were composed by Pale Saarinen, Kari Makkonen and Jukka Haikonen.

Matti Pellonpää died of a heart attack on 13 July 1995 at the age of 44. He was buried in the Malmi Cemetery.

In 1996, Pellonpää was one of the people commemorating 100 years of Finnish Cinema on a stamp.

A Finnish documentary film &quot;Boheemi elää/Bohemian Eyes&quot; on Pellonpää&#x27;s life was made in 2011 (directed by Janne Kuusi).

<text>Anna Katriina &quot;Kati&quot; Outinen (born 17 August 1961) is a Finnish actress who has often played leading female roles in Aki Kaurismäki&#x27;s films.

Outinen was born in Helsinki. Having studied under Jouko Turkka during his &quot;reign&quot; of drama studies in Finland, she nevertheless has never been associated with the &quot;turkkalaisuus&quot; school of acting methodology. Her breakthrough role was as a tough girl in the generational classic youth film &quot;Täältä tullaan elämä&quot; (1980) by Tapio Suominen. In 1984, she appeared in &quot;Aikalainen&quot;.

Besides a strong domestic reputation gained through a widely varied list of roles in theatre and television drama, film director Aki Kaurismäki&#x27;s films have brought Outinen international attention and even adulation, particularly in Germany and France. Her first work together with Kaurismäki was &quot;Shadows in Paradise&quot; in 1986. At the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, Outinen won the award for Best Actress for the Kaurismäki film &quot;The Man Without a Past&quot;. The most recent time that Outinen and Kaurismäki worked together was in the film &quot;The Other Side of Hope&quot; (2017).

She has also contributed to the screenplay of the Finnish soap opera &quot;Salatut elämät&quot;. Outinen portrayed the central character of a Swedish bank manager in the Estonian series &quot;The Bank&quot; (2018). She has appeared as a voice actress in the animation series &quot;Babar&quot;. She has also given her voice to Ritva Tuomivaara on the video game &quot;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus&quot; (2017).

In 2016, Outinen played with Jim Carrey in the film &quot;Dark Crimes&quot;.

Outinen worked as a professor in acting at the Theatre Academy Helsinki from 2002 to 2013.

<text>Aki Olavi Kaurismäki (; born 4 April 1957) is a Finnish film director and screenwriter. He is best known for the award-winning &quot;Drifting Clouds&quot; (1996), &quot;The Man Without a Past&quot; (2002), &quot;Le Havre&quot; (2011), &quot;The Other Side of Hope&quot; (2017) and &quot;Fallen Leaves&quot; (2023), as well as &quot;Leningrad Cowboys Go America&quot; (1989). He has been described as Finland&#x27;s best-known film director.

==Career==
After graduating in media studies from the University of Tampere, Kaurismäki worked as a bricklayer, postman, and dish-washer, long before pursuing his interest in cinema, first as a critic, and later as a screenwriter &amp; director. He started his career as a co-screenwriter and actor in films made by his older brother, Mika Kaurismäki. He played the main role in Mika&#x27;s film &quot;The Liar&quot; (1981). Together they founded the production company Villealfa Filmproductions and later the Midnight Sun Film Festival. His debut as an independent director was &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (1983), an adaptation of Dostoyevsky&#x27;s novel set in modern Helsinki. He gained worldwide attention with &quot;Leningrad Cowboys Go America&quot; (1989). In 1992, the New York Times film critic Vincent Canby declared Kaurismäki &quot;an original ... one of cinema&#x27;s most distinctive and idiosyncratic new artists, and possibly one of the most serious... [He] could well turn out to be the seminal European filmmaker of the &#x27;90s.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1989 he emigrated with his wife, Paula Oinonen, to Portugal, saying &quot;in all of Helsinki there is no place left where I could place my camera&quot;. As of 2023, he is still based in Portugal.
In Helsinki, Kaurismäki is the co-owner of a complex, Andorra, that incorporates a cinema, several bars and a pool hall featuring a giant poster for Robert Bresson&#x27;s &quot;L’Argent.&quot; It also features the jukebox from &quot;Leningrad Cowboys Meet Moses.&quot;

== Style ==

Kaurismäki is known for his extremely minimalistic style. He has been called an auteur, since he writes, directs, produces and usually edits the films himself, and thus introduces his personal &quot;drollery and deadpan&quot; style. The camera is usually still. Events are shown in a plain manner and characters are usually left alone facing the consequences. However, despite their tragedies and setbacks, the characters do not give up and eventually survive.

Much of Kaurismäki&#x27;s work is centred on Helsinki, such as the film &quot;Calamari Union&quot;, the proletariat trilogy (&quot;Shadows in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Ariel&quot; and &quot;The Match Factory Girl&quot;) and the Finland trilogy (&quot;Drifting Clouds&quot;, &quot;The Man Without a Past&quot; and &quot;Lights in the Dusk&quot;). His vision of Helsinki is critical and singularly unromantic. Indeed, his characters often speak about how they wish to get away from Helsinki. Some end up in Mexico (&quot;Ariel&quot;), others in Estonia (&quot;Shadows in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Calamari Union&quot;, and &quot;Take Care of Your Scarf, Tatjana&quot;). Kaurismäki also uses, on purpose, characters, elements and settings that hark back to the 1960s and 1970s.

Kaurismäki has been influenced by the French directors Jean-Pierre Melville, Jacques Becker, and Robert Bresson, the Japanese director Yasujirō Ozu, the American director John Cassavetes, and some critics have also inferred the influence of Rainer Werner Fassbinder. His movies have a humorous side that can also be seen in the films of Jim Jarmusch, who has a cameo in Kaurismäki&#x27;s film &quot;Leningrad Cowboys Go America&quot;. Jarmusch used actors who have appeared frequently in Kaurismäki&#x27;s films in his own film &quot;Night on Earth&quot;, part of which takes place in Helsinki.

Kaurismäki has been a vocal critic of digital cinematography, calling it &quot;a devil&#x27;s invention&quot; and saying he &quot;won&#x27;t make a digital film in this life&quot;. In March 2014, however, he reconciled, saying that &quot;in order to maintain my humble film oeuvre accessible to a potential audience, I have ended up in rendering it to digital in all its present and several of its as yet unknown forms&quot;.

==Political views==
The political context of Kaurismäki&#x27;s work is very much influenced by his attitude to Finland&#x27;s treatment of the working class. In his view, the social and political ramifications of class structures and lack of economic parity render lower-class workers replaceable cogs in an outdated machine.

In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, Kaurismäki signed a letter endorsing the UK Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership in the 2019 UK general election. The letter stated that &quot;Labour&#x27;s election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.&quot;

Kaurismäki has been a critic of Finland&#x27;s immigration policy. When Iraqi refugees arrived in Finland, Kaurismäki said many people in the country &quot;perceived that as an attack, like a war.&quot; He was alarmed by their reaction and decided to make a film, &quot;The Other Side of Hope&quot;, in an effort to &quot;change the Finns&#x27; attitude.&quot; &quot;I respect Mrs. Merkel,&quot; he said, referring to the German chancellor&#x27;s open-door refugee policy, &quot;She is the only politician who seems to be at least interested in the problem.&quot; In a 2007 interview with the film scholar Andrew Nestingen, Kaurismäki said: &quot;The real disgrace here is Finland&#x27;s refugee policy, which is shameful. We refuse refugee status on the flimsiest of grounds and send people back to secure places like Darfur, Iraq, and Somalia. It&#x27;s perfectly safe, go ahead. Our policy is a stain among the Nordic nations. Shameful.&quot;
In 2023, he said he was against Finland&#x27;s entry into NATO.

In December 2023, alongside 50 other filmmakers, Kaurismäki signed an open letter published in &quot;Libération&quot; demanding a ceasefire and an end to the killing of civilians amid the 2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, and for a humanitarian corridor into Gaza to be established for humanitarian aid, and the release of hostages.

==Awards and protests==
Kaurismäki&#x27;s film &quot;Ariel&quot; (1988) was entered into the 16th Moscow International Film Festival where it won the Prix FIPRESCI.

Kaurismäki&#x27;s most acclaimed film has been &quot;The Man Without a Past&quot;, which won the Grand Prix and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Foreign Language Film category in 2003. However, Kaurismäki refused to attend the Oscar ceremony, asserting that he did not feel like partying in a country that was in a state of war. Kaurismäki&#x27;s next film &quot;Lights in the Dusk&quot; was also chosen to be Finland&#x27;s nominee for best foreign-language film, but Kaurismäki again boycotted the awards and refused the nomination, as a protest against U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s foreign policy. In 2002 Kaurismäki also boycotted the 40th New York Film Festival in a show of solidarity with the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, who was not given a US visa in time for the festival.

Kaurismäki&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;The Other Side of Hope&quot; won the Silver Bear for Best Director award at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival. At the same festival he also announced that it would be his last film as a director, although the retirement was short-lived as he began filming another film, &quot;Fallen Leaves&quot;, in 2022, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2023. Kaurismäki became the second director, after Paul Thomas Anderson, to win his third FIPRESCI Grand Prix.

<text>It Can&#x27;t Happen Here is a 1935 dystopian political novel by the American author Sinclair Lewis. Set in a fictionalized version of the 1930s United States, it follows an American politician, Berzelius &quot;Buzz&quot; Windrip, who quickly rises to power to become the country&#x27;s first outright dictator (in allusion to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in Nazi Germany), and Doremus Jessup, a newspaper editor who sees Windrip&#x27;s fascist policies for what they are ahead of time and who becomes Windrip&#x27;s most ardent critic. 

The novel was adapted into a play by Lewis and John C. Moffitt in 1936.

==Premise==
&quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; was published during the heyday of fascism in Europe, which was reported on by Dorothy Thompson, Lewis&#x27;s wife. The novel describes the rise of Berzelius &quot;Buzz&quot; Windrip, a demagogue who is elected President of the United States, after fomenting fear and promising drastic economic and social reforms while promoting a return to patriotism and &quot;traditional&quot; values. After his election, Windrip takes complete control of the government via self-coup and imposes totalitarian rule with the help of a ruthless paramilitary force, in the manner of European fascists such as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. The novel&#x27;s plot centers on journalist Doremus Jessup&#x27;s opposition to the new regime and his subsequent struggle against it as part of a liberal rebellion.

==Plot==
In 1936, American Senator Berzelius &quot;Buzz&quot; Windrip enters the presidential election campaign on a populist platform, promising to restore the country to prosperity and greatness, and promising each citizen $5,000 per year. Portraying himself as a champion of &quot;the forgotten man&quot; and &quot;traditional&quot; American values, Windrip defeats incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt for the Democratic nomination, and then beats his Republican opponent, Senator Walt Trowbridge, in the November election.

Having previously foreshadowed some authoritarian measures to reorganize the government, Windrip outlaws dissent, incarcerates political enemies in concentration camps, and trains and arms a paramilitary force called the &quot;Minute Men&quot; (named after the Revolutionary War militias of the same name), who terrorize citizens and enforce the policies of a corporatist regime. One of Windrip&#x27;s first acts as president is to eliminate the influence of Congress, which draws the ire of many citizens as well as the legislators themselves. The Minute Men respond to protests harshly, attacking demonstrators with bayonets. In addition to these actions, Windrip&#x27;s administration, known as the Corpo government, curtails women&#x27;s and minority rights, and eliminates individual states by subdividing the country into administrative sectors. The government of these sectors is managed by Corpo authorities, usually prominent businessmen or Minute Men officers. Those accused of crimes against the government appear before kangaroo courts presided over by military judges. A majority of Americans approve of these dictatorial measures, seeing them as painful but necessary steps to restore American power.

Open opponents of Windrip, led by Senator Trowbridge, form an organization called the New Underground (named after the Underground Railroad), helping dissidents escape to Canada and distributing anti-Windrip propaganda. One recruit to the New Underground is Doremus Jessup, a traditional liberal and an opponent of both corporatism and communism, the latter being suppressed by Windrip&#x27;s administration. Jessup&#x27;s participation in the organization results in the publication of &quot;The Vermont Vigilance&quot;, a periodical in which he writes editorials decrying Windrip&#x27;s abuses of power.

Shad Ledue, the local district commissioner and Jessup&#x27;s former hired man, resents his old employer. After discovering Jessup&#x27;s actions, Ledue has him sent to a concentration camp. Ledue terrorizes Jessup&#x27;s family and particularly his daughter Sissy, who he unsuccessfully attempts to seduce. Sissy discovers evidence of corrupt dealings on the part of Ledue which she exposes to Francis Tasbrough, a one-time friend of Jessup and Ledue&#x27;s superior in the administrative hierarchy. Tasbrough has Ledue imprisoned in the same camp as Jessup, where inmates sent there by Ledue organize his murder. Jessup eventually escapes when his friends bribe one of the camp guards. He flees to Canada and rejoins the New Underground. He later serves the organization as a spy, passing along information and urging locals to resist Windrip.

In time, Windrip&#x27;s hold on power weakens as his promised economic prosperity fails to materialize, and increased numbers of disillusioned Americans, including Vice President Perley Beecroft, flee the country. Windrip also angers his Secretary of State, Lee Sarason, who had served earlier as his chief political operative and adviser. Sarason and Windrip&#x27;s other lieutenants, including General Dewey Haik, seize power and exile the president to France. Sarason succeeds Windrip, but his extravagant and relatively weak rule creates a power vacuum in which Haik and others vie for power. In a putsch, Haik leads a party of military supporters into the White House, kills Sarason and his associates, and proclaims himself president. The two coups cause a slow erosion of Corpo power. Haik&#x27;s government tries to arouse patriotism by launching an invasion of Mexico, slandering the country in state-run newspapers and ordering a mass conscription of young American men, infuriating many who had until then been Corpo loyalists. Riots and rebellions break out across the country, with many realizing the Corpos have misled them.

General Emmanuel Coon, one of Haik&#x27;s senior officers, defects to the opposition with a large portion of his army, giving strength to the resistance movement. Although Haik remains in control of much of the country, a new civil war soon breaks out as the resistance tries to consolidate its grasp on the Midwest. As the conflict begins, Jessup works as an agent for the New Underground in Corpo-occupied portions of southern Minnesota.

==Reception==

Reviewers at the time, and historians and literary critics ever since, have emphasized the resemblance to Louisiana politician Huey Long, who used strong-arm political tactics and who was building a nationwide &quot;Share Our Wealth&quot; organization in preparing to run for president in the 1936 election. Long was assassinated in 1935 just prior to the novel&#x27;s publication. The inspiration for Windrip backer Bishop Prang was renowned radio priest Charles Coughlin, who in real life conspired with Long to oust Roosevelt in the 1936 U.S. presidential election.


According to Boulard (1998), &quot;the most chilling and uncanny treatment of Huey by a writer came with Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;.&quot; Lewis portrayed a genuine U.S. dictator on the Hitler model. Starting in 1936, the Works Progress Administration, a New Deal agency, performed the stage adaptation across the country; Lewis had the goal of hurting Long&#x27;s chances in the 1936 election.

Keith Perry argues that the key weakness of the novel is not that he decks out U.S. politicians with sinister European touches, but that he finally conceives of fascism and totalitarianism in terms of traditional U.S. political models rather than seeing them as introducing a new kind of society and a new kind of regime. Windrip is less a Nazi than a con-man-plus-Rotarian, a manipulator who knows how to appeal to people&#x27;s desperation, but neither he nor his followers are in the grip of the kind of world-transforming ideology like Hitler&#x27;s Nazism.

==Adaptations==
===Stage===
In 1936, Lewis and John C. Moffitt wrote a stage version, also titled &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;, which is still produced. The stage version premiered on October 27, 1936, in 21 U.S. theaters in 17 states simultaneously, in productions sponsored by the Federal Theatre Project.

The Z Collective, a San Francisco theater company, adapted the novel for the stage, producing it both in 1989 and 1992. In 2004, Z Space adapted the Collective&#x27;s script into a radio drama that was broadcast on the Pacifica radio network on the anniversary of the Federal Theatre Project&#x27;s original premiere.

A new stage adaptation by Tony Taccone and Bennett S. Cohen premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in September 2016.

===Unfinished film===
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) purchased the rights in late 1935 for a reported $200,000 from seeing the galley proofs, with Lucien Hubbard (&quot;Wings&quot;) as the producer. By early 1936, screenwriter Sidney Howard completed an adaptation, his third of Lewis&#x27;s novels. J. Walter Ruben was named to direct the film with the cast headed by Lionel Barrymore, Walter Connolly, Virginia Bruce, and Basil Rathbone. Studio head Louis B. Mayer indefinitely postponed production, citing costs, to the publicly announced pleasure of the Nazi regime in Germany. Lewis and Howard countered that financial reason with information pointing to Berlin&#x27;s and Rome&#x27;s influence on movies. Will H. Hays, responsible for the enforcement of the Motion Picture Production Code, had notified Mayer of potential problems in the German market. Joseph Breen, head of the Production Code Administration department under Hays, thought the script was too &quot;anti-fascist&quot; and &quot;so filled with dangerous material&quot;.

In December 1938, Charlie Chaplin announced his next movie would satirize Hitler (&quot;The Great Dictator&quot;). MGM&#x27;s Hubbard &quot;dusted off the script&quot; in January, but the &quot;idea of a dictator ruling America&quot; had now been discussed in public for years. Hubbard rewrote a new climax, &quot;showing a dictatorship in Washington and showing it being kicked out by disgruntled Americans as soon as they realized what had happened.&quot; The film was placed back on the production schedule for the third time with shooting starting in June and Lewis Stone playing Doremus Jessup. By July 1939, MGM &quot;admitted it would not make the movie after all&quot; to some criticism.

===Television===
The 1968 television movie &quot;Shadow on the Land&quot;, which also went by the title &quot;United States: It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;, was produced by Screen Gems as a backdoor pilot for a series. The TV movie, a thriller which takes place following the fascist takeover, is often cited as an adaptation of Lewis&#x27;s novel but does not credit the novel.

Inspired by the book, director–producer Kenneth Johnson in 1982 scripted a miniseries entitled &quot;Storm Warnings&quot;. NBC executives, to whom Johnson presented the script, rejected the original, which they considered too cerebral for the average American viewer. In order to make the script more marketable, &quot;Storm Warnings&quot; was revised into a far less subtle alien invasion story in which the invaders initially pose as humanity&#x27;s friends, but prove to be a genocidal militaristic power with thinly disguised Nazi trappings intent on draining the planet of its water and using humanity predominantly as a food source. The new script formed the basis for the popular miniseries &quot;V&quot;, which premiered May 3, 1983.

===Radio===
A 4-part radio adaptation of the 2016 Berkeley Repertory Theatre stage version aired on public radio stations and on YouTube from October 13 through November 8, 2020, during the run-up to the Presidential election. Among the cast members were David Strathairn as Doremus Jessup. The intent of the project was &quot;to encourage dialogue and motivate citizens to exercise their civic power and vote.&quot;

A 6-part radio play version based on the book titled &quot;It Happened Here 2024&quot; started airing on October 2, 2024 in the United States, produced by WNYC Studios, a New York City NPR affiliate. Starring the voice talents of Tony Shalhoub, Edie Falco and John Turturro it adapts both the original book by Lewis and Richard Dresser&#x27;s novel, &quot;It Happened Here.&quot; The story revolves around the impacts of the rise of a fascist dictator in America, who is called &quot;The Great Leader,&quot; and how the family and country were torn asunder by white nationalist violence and extremism. Episodes 1 and 2 were released on October 2 and the series plays on the NPR On the Media podcast.

A British adaptation of the book for BBC Radio 4 aired on October 5, 2024. It stars Ben Miles as Jessup and Nathan Osgood as Windrip.

==Legacy==
Since its publication, &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; has been seen as a cautionary tale, starting with the 1936 presidential election and potential candidate Huey Long.

In retrospect, Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s internment of Japanese Americans during World War II has been used as an example of &quot;It can happen here,&quot; despite nominally being a measure against the fascistic Empire of Japan.

Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention released their first album &quot;Freak Out!&quot; in 1966 with the song &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;.

In May 1973, in the middle of the Watergate scandal, Knight Newspapers published an ad in their own and other publications, headlined &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; and emphasizing the importance of free press: &quot;There is a struggle going on in this country. It is not just a fight by reporters and editors to protect their sources. It is a fight to protect the public&#x27;s right to know. [...] It can&#x27;t happen here as long as the press remains an open conduit through which public information flows.&quot; Herbert Mitgang in his op-ed piece said &quot;The headline of this ad is the title of a novel that keeps insinuating itself these days, not because of its literary qualities but because of its prescience.&quot; And that Lewis&#x27;s point was &quot;that home‐grown hypocrisy leads to a nice brand of home‐grown authoritarianism.&quot;

Joe Conason&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;It Can Happen Here: Authoritarian Peril in the Age of Bush&quot; (2007) frequently quotes Lewis&#x27;s book in relation to the presidency of George W. Bush.

===Presidency of Donald Trump===
Several writers have compared the demagogue Buzz Windrip to Donald Trump. Michael Paulson wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the Berkeley Repertory Theatre&#x27;s 2016 rendition of the play aimed to provoke discussion about Trump&#x27;s presidential candidacy. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Jules Stewart discussed the similarities between Trump&#x27;s America with the country as depicted in the book. In &quot;Salon&quot;, Malcolm Harris stated: &quot;Like Trump, Windrip uses a lack of tact as a way to distinguish himself&quot; and &quot;The social forces that Windrip and Trump invoke aren’t funny, they’re murderous.&quot; In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Carlos Lozada compared Trump to Windrip, opining that &quot;it is impossible to miss the similarities between Trump and totalitarian figures in American literature.&quot; Jacob Weisberg wrote in &quot;Slate&quot; that one &quot;can’t read Lewis&#x27;s novel today without flashes of Trumpian recognition.&quot; Following the results of the 2016 United States presidential election, sales of &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; surged significantly, and it appeared on Amazon.com&#x27;s list of bestselling books. Penguin Modern Classics released a new edition of the novel on January 20, 2017, the same day as the inauguration of Donald Trump.

In 2018, HarperCollins published &quot;Can It Happen Here?: Authoritarianism in America&quot;, a collection of essays about the prospect of authoritarianism in the United States, edited by Cass Sunstein.

In 2019, Robert Evans produced the podcast series &quot;It Could Happen Here&quot;, which speculated on the causes and consequences of a hypothetical second American Civil War.

In 2021, New York University Press published a book &quot;It Can Happen Here: White Power and the Rising Threat of Genocide in the US&quot; by genocide scholar Alexander Laban Hinton. Hinton argued that &quot;there is a real risk of violent atrocities happening in the United States&quot;.

<text>Yleisradio Oy (; ), abbreviated as Yle () (formerly styled in all uppercase until 2012), translated into English as the Finnish Broadcasting Company, is Finland&#x27;s national public broadcasting company, founded in 1926. It is a joint-stock company, which is 99.98% owned by the Finnish state and employs around 3,200 people in Finland. Yle shares many of its organisational characteristics with its British counterpart, the BBC, on which it was largely modelled.

Yle was long funded by revenues obtained from a broadcast receiving license fee payable by the owners of radio sets (1927–1976) and television sets (1958–2012) and through a portion of the broadcasting license fees payable by private television broadcasters. Since 2013, the license fee has been replaced by a public broadcasting tax (known as the Yle tax) collected annually from Finnish citizens and corporations.

The main part of the Yle tax is collected from individual taxpayers, with payments assessed on a sliding scale. Minors and those with an annual income less than €7,813 are exempt. At the lower limit, the tax payable by individuals is €50 per annum, and the maximum (payable by an individual with a yearly income of €20,588 or more) is €140. The rationale for the abolition of the television license fee was the development of other means of delivering Yle&#x27;s services, such as the Internet, and the consequent impracticality of continuing to tie the fee to the ownership of a specific device. Yle receives no advertising revenue, as all channels are advertisement-free.

Yle has a status that could be described as that of a non-departmental public body. It is governed by a parliamentary governing council. Yle&#x27;s turnover in 2010 was €398.4 million. In 2024, Yle&#x27;s annual budget was about €600 million.

Yle operates three national television channels, 13 radio channels and services, and 25 regional radio stations. As Finland is constitutionally bilingual—around 5.5% of the population speaks Swedish as their native language—Yle provides radio and TV programming in Swedish through its Swedish-language department, Svenska Yle. As is customary in Finland, foreign films and TV programmes (as well as segments of local programmes that feature foreign language content, like news reports) are generally subtitled on Yle&#x27;s channels. Dubbing is used in cartoons intended for young children who have not yet learned to read; off-screen narration in documentaries is also frequently dubbed.

In the field of international broadcasting, one of Yle&#x27;s best-known services was Nuntii Latini, the news in Latin, which was broadcast worldwide and made available on the Internet.

Yle was one of 23 founding broadcasting organisations of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950. It hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Helsinki.

== History ==

&quot;Suomen Yleisradio&quot; (Finland&#x27;s General Radio) was founded in Helsinki on 29 May 1926. The first radio programme was transmitted on 9 September that year in a studio at Unioninkatu 20, generally considered the birthdate of regular broadcasting activities in Finland. The name Yleisradio was taken from the Defense Forces, where Yleisradio meant a radio broadcast that could be heard by everyone. Before YLE, Radio broadcasts were done by Radiola in Helsinki from March 23, 1924, the radio battalion of the Finnish Defense Forces in Santahamina at the former Russian Empire Baltic Fleet officer casino, now Katajanokka casino starting in April 1923 and by Tampereen radioyhdistys, (Tampere Radio Society) in April 1924. Not until 1928 did Yle&#x27;s broadcasts become available throughout the country. By the beginning of the 1930s, 100,000 households could listen to Yle programmes, and in 1933, Yle moved to Fabianinkatu 15, were it would stay until 1968 were it moved to Ylen Kesäkatu and then Mediatalo in 1978.

In 1957, Yle made its first television broadcast tests, and regular TV programming began the next year under the name &quot;Suomen Televisio&quot; (Finland&#x27;s Television), which was later renamed Yle TV1. Television&#x27;s popularity in the country grew rapidly. In 1964, Yle obtained TES-TV and Tamvisio, which were merged into Yle TV2. In 1969, the Finnish Broadcasting Company began broadcasting television programmes in colour, but due to the high cost of colour technology, colour only became standard in the late 1970s. On 1 May 1977, &quot;Tv-uutiset&quot; (TV-news) and TV-nytt switched to colour.

In 1996, Yle&#x27;s operations in the Åland Islands were transferred to Ålands Radio and TV, and in 1998, Yle&#x27;s transmitter network and related assets were spun off into a separate company called .

In the 2000s, Yle established several new radio and television channels. In 2007, there was a digital television switchover. A completely new digital channel, &quot;Yle Teema&quot; (Yle Theme) was introduced, and the Swedish-language FST (&quot;Finlands Svenska Television,&quot; Finland&#x27;s Swedish Television) was moved from its analogue channel to its digital one, YLE FST5 (later renamed Yle Fem). In addition to these four channels (TV1, TV2, Teema, and Fem), a fifth channel, YLE24, was launched in 2001 for 24-hour news programming. This channel was replaced by YLE Extra, a channel attempting to cater to the youth, which was in turn decommissioned in 2007. Until 4 August 2008, the fifth channel was used to broadcast Yle TV1 with Finnish subtitles on programmes in foreign languages (without having to enable the TV&#x27;s or digital set-top box&#x27;s subtitle function).

== Yle tax ==

Until the end of 2012, Finnish citizens paid Yle a license fee for the use of a television, set at 252 euros per year in 2012. The license fee was per location, which could hold several sets (e.g. in a living room as well as a bedroom). The public broadcasting tax, also known as the Yle tax, replaced the license fee in 2013. The tax ranges from 50 euros to 140 euros per person and per year, depending on income. Minors and persons with low income are exempt from the tax.

== Controversies ==

In radio, Yle was a legal monopoly until 1985, when local radio stations were permitted, and maintained a national monopoly until 1995, when national radio networks were allowed.

In the past, Yle has been seen in Finland as a &quot;red&quot; or leftist medium. This was true especially in 1965–69, during the term of Director-General Eino S. Repo, who got the position with the backing of the Agrarian League and President Kekkonen (a member of the Agrarian Party), as he was Kekkonen&#x27;s personal friend. He was accused of favouring leftist student radicalism and young, left-leaning reporters with programmes critical of capitalism that demanded reforms to bring Finland closer to the Soviet Union, and Yle was given the nickname &quot;Reporadio&quot;. After Repo resigned, he was demoted to director of radio broadcasting, on the communist-led People&#x27;s Democratic League mandate.

Repo resigned in 1969, but according to Yle, the &quot;political mandate&quot; remained, as Erkki Raatikainen was named director directly from the Social Democratic Party office. All directors after him until 2010 were Social Democrats. This was ended by the appointment of the right-wing National Coalition Party&#x27;s Lauri Kivinen as director in 2010.

During Finlandisation and the leftist radicalization of the 1970s, Yle contributed to Kekkonen&#x27;s policy of &quot;neutrality&quot; by broadcasting the program &quot;Näin naapurissa&quot; about the Soviet Union. This program was produced in cooperation with the Soviets and supported Soviet propaganda without criticism.

Kivinen&#x27;s appointment in 2010 received much criticism, as he was previously head of Nokia Siemens Networks, which had sold monitoring equipment to the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence, allowing them to arrest political dissidents throughout the protests in the fall of 2009.

English-language newscaster Kimmo Wilska was fired on 13 October 2010 after pretending to be caught drinking on camera following an alcohol-related news story on &quot;Yle News&quot;. His stunt was not well received by Yle management, which fired him that day. Wilska received substantial support after his termination.

Yle has been criticised for buying many HBO series. It has responded by emphasising the suitability of series to channels with no ad breaks, citing HBO programming&#x27;s quality and low price, and stating that American programmes constitute only 7% of its programming.

===Decision to close shortwave===
The broadcasts on shortwave from Yle Radio Finland were closed at the end of 2006. Expatriate organisations had been campaigning for continued service, but their efforts did not succeed in maintaining the service or even in slowing the process. The decision also affected a high-powered medium wave on 963 kHz (312m). A smaller medium wave covering the Gulf of Finland region (558 kHz, 538m) remained on air for one more year.

====Parliamentary question about shortwave====
In November 2005, MP Pertti Hemmilä (N) submitted a question in Parliament about the plans of Yle to end its availability on international shortwave bands. In his question, Hemmilä took up the low cost of the world band radio to the consumer travelling or living abroad. In her response, the Minister of Transport and Communications, Susanna Huovinen (S) noted that Yle would now be available via other means, such as satellites and the Internet. She also underlined the fact that Yle is not under government control, but under indirect parliamentary supervision.

==== YLE Gate 2017 ====
The Council for Mass Media in Finland criticized Yleisradio for restricting news reports about Prime Minister Juha Sipilä&#x27;s investments and business in 2017. The chief editor of Yle threatened that Yle would resign from the Council. PM Sipilä had been angry over Yle&#x27;s reports on the Talvivaara mine and Katera Steel (a company owned by relatives of Sipilä). Several reporters were barred from publishing stories about political connections between Sipilä and companies owned by his relatives, and state financing of the Talvivaara mine (Terrafame mine).

<text>Raphael David Maklouf (born 10 December 1937) is a British sculptor, best known for designing an effigy of Queen Elizabeth II used on the coins of many Commonwealth nations.

Maklouf was born in Jerusalem, to a Jewish family; his father was Samuel Maklouf (1911–1990, born in Safed, then in Palestine); his mother was Leonie Maklouf (born in Saarbrücken, Germany, 1915).

The family emigrated to the United Kingdom after the Second World War. Raphael Maklouf attended the Camberwell School of Art until 1958, afterwards becoming an academic lecturer for ten years. He was made an Associate of the Royal Society of British Sculptors in 1979.

Two of his designs were selected for British coinage on 8 August 1984, one for general circulation and another for commemorative issues. They were used on the coins of several countries from 1985 to 1997. His initials, RDM, are engraved at the base of the Queen&#x27;s neck. He is additionally known for his sculptural design representing the fifteen Stations of the Cross in Brentwood Cathedral. He is associated with Tower Mint Ltd, which privately produces medals, coins for collectors, and similar items.

<doc id="201232" wikidata="Q737834" url="?curid=201232" title="Siddhi">
<text>In Indian religions,  (Sanskrit: &quot;&quot;; fulfillment, accomplishment) are material, paranormal, supernatural, or otherwise magical powers, abilities, and attainments that are the products of yogic advancement through sādhanās such as meditation and yoga. The term ṛddhi (Pali: &quot;iddhi&quot;, &quot;psychic powers&quot;) is often used interchangeably in Buddhism.

==Etymology==
&quot;Siddhi&quot; is a Sanskrit noun which can be translated as &quot;knowledge&quot;, &quot;accomplishment&quot;, &quot;attainment&quot;, or &quot;success&quot;.

==Method==
The &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; is one of the texts to give explicit details about how spiritual masters were thought to actually manifest supernormal abilities. It states that abilities such as flying through the air, walking through solid obstructions, diving into the ground, walking on water and so forth are achieved through changing one element, such as earth, into another element, such as air. The individual must master &quot;kasina&quot; meditation before this is possible. Dipa Ma, who trained via the Visuddhimagga, claimed to have these abilities, but her claim was never independently verified.

==Usage in Hinduism ==

In the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;, an ancient Indian collection of moral fables, &quot;siddhi&quot; may be the term for any unusual skill or faculty or capability.

===Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot;===
In Patañjali&#x27;s &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; IV.1 it is stated, &quot;Janma auṣadhi mantra tapaḥ samādhijāḥ siddhayaḥ&quot;, &quot;Accomplishments may be attained through birth, the use of herbs, incantations, self-discipline or samadhi&quot;. Patanjali discusses &quot;siddhi&quot; in Vibhuti Pada (third chapter) and commentators like Vyasa consider it as a by-product of yogic path due to mastery over &quot;prakriti&quot;. Verse III.37 warns that &quot;siddhis&quot; serve as milestones or distractions rather than as the ultimate goal. Verse III.55 further explains that liberation (&quot;kaivalya&quot;) is achieved through discriminative knowledge, not through mystic powers. Once ignorance is removed through such knowledge, the cycle of rebirth (&quot;samsara&quot;) ceases.

===Eight classical siddhis ===
According to different sources, below are the eight classical siddhis (&quot;Ashta Siddhi&quot;) or eight great perfections:
* &quot;Aṇimā&quot;: the ability to reduce one&#x27;s body to the size of an atom.
* &quot;Mahimā&quot;: the ability to expand one&#x27;s body to an infinitely large size.
* &quot;Laghimā&quot;: the ability to become weightless or lighter than air.
* &quot;Garimā&quot;: the ability to become heavy or dense.
* &quot;Prāpti&quot;: the ability to realize whatever one desires.
* &quot;Prākāmya&quot;: the ability to access any place in the world. 
* &quot;Īśitva&quot;: the ability to control all material elements or natural forces.
* &quot;Vaśitva&quot;: the ability to force influence upon anyone.
In ISKCON texts, the ability to become heavy or dense (&quot;Garimā&quot;) is named &quot;Mahimā&quot;, which (the ability to expand one&#x27;s body) gets replaced with &quot;Kāmāvasāyitā&quot;, the ability to take any shape or form one may even whimsically desire.

===Shaivism===
In Shaivism, siddhis are defined as &quot;Extraordinary powers of the soul, developed through consistent meditation and often uncomfortable and grueling tapas, or awakened naturally through spiritual maturity and yogic sādhanā.&quot;

===Vaishnavism===
In Vaishnavism, the term &quot;siddhi&quot; is used in the &quot;Sarva-darśana-saṃgraha&quot; of Madhvacharya (1238–1317), the founder of Dvaita (dualist) philosophy.

====Five siddhis, according to Vaishnava doctrine====
In the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, the five siddhis brought on by yoga and meditation are:
# &quot;trikālajñatvam&quot;: knowing the past, present and future.
# &quot;advandvam&quot;: tolerance of heat, cold and other dualities.
# &quot;para citta ādi abhijñatā&quot;: knowing the minds of others, etc.
# &quot;agni arka ambu viṣa ādīnām pratiṣṭambhaḥ&quot;: checking the influence of fire, sun, water, poison, etc.
# &quot;aparājayah&quot;: remaining unconquered by others.

====Ten secondary siddhis, according to Vaishnava doctrine====
In the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, Krishna describes the ten secondary siddhis:
* &quot;anūrmimattvam&quot;: Being undisturbed by hunger, thirst, and other bodily appetites.
* &quot;dūraśravaṇa&quot;: Hearing things far away.
* &quot;dūradarśanam&quot;: Seeing things far away.
* &quot;manojavah&quot;: Moving the body wherever thought goes (teleportation/astral projection).
* &quot;kāmarūpam&quot;: Assuming any form desired.
* &quot;parakāya praveśanam&quot;: Entering the bodies of others.
* &quot;svachanda mṛtyuh&quot;: Dying when one desires.
* &quot;devānām saha krīḍā anudarśanam&quot;: Witnessing and participating in the pastimes of the gods.
* &quot;yathā saṅkalpa saṁsiddhiḥ&quot;: Perfect accomplishment of one&#x27;s determination.
* &quot;ājñāpratihatā gatiḥ&quot;: Orders or commands being unimpeded.

===Samkhya philosophy===
In the &quot;Samkhyakarika&quot; and &quot;Tattvasamasa&quot;, there are references to the attainment of eight siddhis by which &quot;one becomes free of the pain of ignorance, one gains knowledge, and experiences bliss&quot;.
The eight siddhis hinted at by Kapila in the &quot;Tattvasamasa&quot; are, as explained in verse 51 of the &quot;Samkhyakarika&quot;:
# &quot;Ūha&quot;: based on the samskaras (karmic imprints) of previous births, the attainment of knowledge about the twenty-four tattvas gained by examining the determinable and indeterminable, conscious and non-conscious constituents of creation.
# &quot;Śabda&quot;: knowledge gained by associating with an enlightened person (Guru – upadesh).
# &quot;Adhyayana&quot;: knowledge gained through study of the Vedas and other standard ancillary texts.
# &quot;Suhṛtprāpti&quot;: knowledge gained from a kind-hearted person, while engaged in the spread of knowledge.
# &quot;Dānā&quot;: knowledge gained regardless of one’s own needs while attending to the requirements of those engaged in the search of the highest truth.
# &quot;Ādhyātmika-duḥkhabighāta&quot;: freedom from pain, disappointment, etc. that may arise due to lack of spiritual, metaphysical, mystic knowledge and experience.
# &quot;Ādhibhautika-duḥkhabighāta&quot;: freedom from pain etc. arising from possessing and being attached to various materialistic gains.
# &quot;Ādhidaivika-duḥkhabighāta&quot;: freedom from pain etc. caused by fate or due to reliance on fate.

It is believed that the attainment of these eight siddhis renders one free of the pain of ignorance and gives one knowledge and bliss.

===Hindu deities associated with gaining siddhi===
Ganesha, Hanuman, various forms of Devi, Vishnu and various other deities are popularly seen as the keepers of siddhis, with the ability to grant them to the worshipper. The attainment of such siddhis is a more pronounced goal in Shaivism. Notably, Hanuman is an incarnation of Shiva, and Ganesh is His son. The last day of Navaratri, the celebration of the pastimes and forms of Goddess Parvati, the wife of Shiva, is for Siddhidhatri, quite literally &quot;She who has the power to grant the Siddhis&quot;. According to the lore of the Puranas, it becomes apparent that Shiva is in fact the holder and releaser of such important and powerful abilities.

==Usage in Sikhism==
In Sikhism, siddhi means &quot;insight&quot;. &quot;Eight Siddhis&quot; is a term used for insight of the eight qualities of Nirankar or a.k.a. Akal Purakh mentioned in the &quot;Mul Mantar&quot; in the Guru Granth Sahib. God has eight qualities: Ek Onkar, Satnam, Kartapurakh, Nirbhao, Nirvair, AkaalMurat, Ajooni and Svaibhang. The one who has insight into these qualities is called &quot;Sidh&quot; or &quot;Gurmukh&quot;.

# Ek Onkar: There is one formless God
# Satnam: God is True, His remembrance is true
# Kartapurakh: God alone is creator
# Nirbhao: God is fearless
# Nirvair: God has no enmity with anyone
# Akaal Murat: God is eternal, beyond time
# Ajooni Svaibhang: God is beyond the cycle of birth and death, God is svayambhu, Self-Existent
# Gurparasad: God is attained by the Grace of the True Guru

Sidh means the one who has mastered his self.

==Usage in Vajrayana Buddhism==
In Tantric Buddhism, siddhi specifically refers to the acquisition of supernatural powers by psychic or magical means or the supposed faculty so acquired. These powers include items such as clairvoyance, levitation, bilocation and astral projection, materialization, and having access to memories from past lives.

<text>Sir Arthur Lasenby Liberty (13 August 1843 – 11 May 1917) was a British merchant, and the founder of Liberty &amp; Co.

==Early life==
Arthur Liberty was born on 13 August 1843 in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, England, the son of a draper. He began work at sixteen with an uncle who sold lace, and later another uncle who sold wine. By 1859 he was apprenticed to a draper, but he instead took a job at Farmer &amp; Rogers, which specialised in women&#x27;s fashions. He quickly rose to the post of manager of the warehouse.

==Liberty &amp; Co.==
After Farmer &amp; Rogers refused to make him a partner in their business, Liberty, in 1875, opened his own shop, Liberty &amp; Co., in Regent Street, London. There he sold ornaments, fabrics and miscellaneous objets d&#x27;art from the Far East.

Liberty &amp; Co. initially provided an eclectic mix of popular styles, but went on to develop a fundamentally different style closely linked to the Aesthetic Movement of the 1890s, Art Nouveau (the &quot;new art&quot;). The company became synonymous with this new style to the extent that in Italy, Art Nouveau became known as &quot;Stile Liberty&quot; after the London shop. The company&#x27;s printed and dyed fabrics, particularly silks and satins, were notable for their subtle and &quot;artistic&quot; colours and highly esteemed as dress material, especially during the decades from 1890 to 1920.

Arthur Liberty married first Martha Cottam in 1865, from whom he obtained a divorce in 1869 on the grounds of her adultery and second, Emma Louise Blackmore in 1875. They had no children. He was knighted in 1913.

==Death and legacy==
Liberty died on 11 May 1917. Before he died, Liberty had amassed a small fortune as a majority shareholder in Liberty &amp; Co. (it had become a public limited liability company in 1890). He left a manor house, several cottages and a large area of farmland near his birthplace in Buckinghamshire.
His gravestone was designed by Archibald Knox, one of Liberty &amp; Co.&#x27;s long-standing designers.

<doc id="201245" wikidata="Q52679" url="?curid=201245" title="Steve Redgrave">
<text>Sir Steven Geoffrey Redgrave (born 23 March 1962) is a British retired rower who won gold medals at five consecutive Olympic Games from 1984 to 2000. He has also won three Commonwealth Games gold medals and nine World Rowing Championships golds. He is the most successful male rower in Olympic history, and the only man to have won gold medals at five Olympic Games in an endurance sport.

Redgrave is regarded as one of Britain&#x27;s greatest-ever Olympians. As of 2025 he is the fifth-most decorated British Olympian, after cyclists Sir Chris Hoy, Sir Jason Kenny, Sir Bradley Wiggins and Dame Laura Kenny. He has carried the British flag at the opening of the Olympic Games on two occasions. In 2002, he was ranked number 36 in the BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. He received the BBC Sports Personality of the Year – Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011.

==Early life and education==
Redgrave was born in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, to Geoffrey Edward Redgrave, a submariner in the Second World War who became a builder, and Sheila Marion, daughter of Harold Stevenson, a local bus driver. His great-grandparents Harry and Susannah Redgrave moved to Marlow from Bramfield, Suffolk, in 1887. He was educated at Great Marlow School.

==Rowing career==
Redgrave&#x27;s primary discipline was sweep rowing, in which he won Olympic Gold rowing both bowside and strokeside (port and starboard).

From 1991, the crews in which he rowed became renowned for their consistent dominance, winning almost every time they raced.

For much of his career he suffered illness: in 1992 he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, and in 1997 he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2.

===Olympic Games===
Redgrave won gold medals at five consecutive Olympic Games from 1984 to 2000, plus a bronze medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

Immediately after winning the 1996 Olympic Gold Medal, he stated that if anyone found him close to a rowing boat again, they could shoot him. However, he changed his mind shortly afterward, and resumed training after a four-month break. The gold medal achieved by him and Matthew Pinsent in the coxless pair at the Atlanta 1996 games was particularly notable for being the only gold medal achieved by the entire British Olympic team across all sports during that particular Olympic games.

In 2000, he won his fifth consecutive Olympic Gold Medal and retired from the sport. In August 2000, prior to his final Olympic Games, the BBC broadcast &quot;Gold Fever&quot;, a three-part BBC documentary which had followed the coxless four in the years leading up to the Olympics. It included video diaries recording the highs and lows in the quest for gold. At the medal ceremony after the 2000 Summer Olympics he was also presented with a gold Olympic pin by IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch in recognition of his achievement.

===World Championships===
At the World Rowing Championships he won nine gold medals, two silvers, and a bronze.

He won the World Championship for Indoor rowing in 1991.

===Henley Royal Regatta===
He competed at Henley Royal Regatta for more than two decades, winning: the Silver Goblets &amp; Nickalls&#x27; Challenge Cup for coxless pairs seven times (twice with Andy Holmes, once with Simon Berrisford and four times with Matthew Pinsent); the Stewards&#x27; Challenge Cup for coxless fours five times; the Diamond Challenge Sculls twice; the Double Sculls Challenge Cup with Eric Sims then with Adam Clift; and the Queen Mother Challenge Cup for quadruple sculls.

===Wingfield Sculls===
He won the Wingfield Sculls for single scullers five times between 1985 and 1989.

==Life after rowing==
In April 2006 Redgrave completed his third London Marathon, raising a record £1,800,000 for charity.

He starred in &quot;Top Ground Gear Force&quot; for Sport Relief in 2008, where the &quot;Top Gear&quot; Team (Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond) took on &quot;Ground Force&quot; with predictable results, and trashed his garden.

He launched his own Fairtrade Cotton Brand of clothing called FiveG, which was sold in Debenhams department stores.

He was involved in starting a rowing academy in India at Lavasa, the new Hill City being developed near Pune City.

In April 2008, Redgrave took part in the Olympic Torch relay for the games in Beijing, and he went on to be one of the final torch-bearers for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, carrying the torch into the stadium, where seven young athletes shared the task of lighting the cauldron at the opening ceremony.

He was named a Patron of the Jaguar Academy of Sport in 2010.

In 2012, he took up kayaking and attempted the Devizes-to-Westminster marathon kayak race, but had to withdraw halfway through due to tiredness.

He rowed on the &quot;Gloriana&quot; as part of the royal pageant for the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

In August 2014, Redgrave was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In May 2018, Redgrave assumed the High-Level Performance Director role for the Chinese Rowing Association to help China&#x27;s rowing team&#x27;s target of one gold medal at the Tokyo 2020 Games and two golds at Paris 2024.

In 2025, Redgrave appeared as a contestant on the seventeenth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;. He was paired with Vicky Ogden and they were the third couple to be eliminated from the competition in week 4.

==Personal life==

He married Ann Callaway (now Lady Ann Redgrave) in 1988; also an elite rower, she represented Great Britain in the women&#x27;s eight at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984. She was Chief Medical Officer to the GB rowing team from 1992 to 2001 and since 2009 their first full-time Medical Officer. He was the honorary president of British Rowing.

Redgrave has three children, Natalie, Sophie and Zak. Natalie rowed with the Oxford University Women&#x27;s Boat Club which won the women&#x27;s boat race at Henley Boat Races in 2011.

He is a supporter of Chelsea Football Club.

==Honours==

Redgrave was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1987, and promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1997. In the 2001 New Year Honours he was appointed a Knight Bachelor &quot;for services to Rowing&quot;, which he received in Buckingham Palace from Queen Elizabeth II on 1 May 2001.

He was voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2000, , and received the BBC Sports – Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011.

He was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of the University from Heriot Watt University in November 2001, having previously been awarded an Honorary Blue in 1997.

In 2001, he was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Technology by Loughborough University.

In 2000, his fifth Olympic gold was voted the greatest sporting moment in Channel 4&#x27;s 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.

The Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake was opened by him and Matthew Pinsent in 2006. The lake and boathouse provide training, medical and scientific facilities for the GB rowing squad.

In 2013, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Edinburgh &quot;in recognition of his outstanding sporting achievements and role as a sports ambassador&quot;.

<text>The true parrots are about 350 species of hook-billed, mostly herbivorous birds forming the superfamily Psittacoidea, one of the three superfamilies in the biological order Psittaciformes (parrots). True parrots are widespread, with species in Mexico, Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, India, Southeast Asia, Australia, and eastwards across the Pacific Ocean as far as Polynesia. The true parrots include many of the familiar parrots including macaws, conures, lorikeets, eclectus, Amazon parrots, grey parrot, and budgerigar. Most true parrots are colourful and flighted, with a few notable exceptions.

==Overview==

True parrots have a beak with a characteristic curved shape, the jaw with a mobility slightly higher than where it connects with the skull, and a generally upright position. They also have a large cranial capacity and are one of the most intelligent bird groups. They are good fliers and skillful climbers on branches of trees.

Some species can imitate the human voice and other sounds, although they do not have vocal cords, instead possessing a vocal organ at the base of the trachea known as the syrinx.

Like most parrots, the Psittacidae are primarily seed eaters. Some variation is seen in the diet of individual species, with fruits, nuts, leaves, and even insects and other animal prey being taken on occasion by some species. The lorikeets are predominantly nectar feeders; many other parrots drink nectar, as well. Most Psittacidae are cavity-nesting birds which form monogamous pair bonds.

===Distribution and habitat===
The true parrots are distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, covering many different habitats, from the humid tropical forests to deserts in Australia, India, Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America, and two species, one extinct (the Carolina parakeet), formerly in the United States. However, the larger populations are native to Australasia, South America, and Central America.

==Conservation status==
Many species are classified as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (see IUCN Red List of birds), as well as national and nongovernmental organizations. Trade in birds and other wild animals is governed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Nearly all parrots are listed on CITES appendices, trade limited or prohibited. Trapping wild parrots for the pet trade, hunting, habitat loss, and competition from invasive species have diminished wild populations, with parrots being subjected to more exploitation than any other group of birds. Of the animals removed from the wild to be sold, very few survive during capture and transport, and those that do often die from poor conditions of captivity, poor diet, and stress. Measures taken to conserve the habitats of some high-profile charismatic species have also protected many of the less charismatic species living in the same ecosystems.

About 18 species of parrots have gone extinct since 1500 (see List of extinct birds#Psittaciformes), nearly all in superfamily Psittacoidea.

==Taxonomy==

The parrot family Psittacidae (along with the family Cacatuidae comprising the order Psittaciformes) was traditionally considered to contain two subfamilies, the Psittacinae (typical parrots and allies) and the Loriinae (lories and lorikeets). However, the tree of the parrot family now has been reorganized under the superfamily Psittacoidea: family Psittacidae has been split into three families, tribes Strigopini and Nestorini split out and placed under superfamily Strigopoidea and a new monotypic superfamily Cacatuoidea created containing family Cacatuidae.

The following classification is based on the most recent proposal, which in turn is based on all the relevant recent findings.

Family Psittacidae, New World and African parrots
*Subfamily Psittacinae: Two African genera, &quot;Psittacus&quot; and &quot;Poicephalus&quot;
*Subfamily Arinae
**Tribe Arini: 17 genera, and one extinct genus
**Tribe Androglossini: seven genera
**clade (proposed tribe &quot;Amoropsittacini&quot;) four genera
**clade (proposed tribe &quot;Forpini&quot;) one genus
**(other tribes) five genera
Family Psittrichasiidae, Indian Ocean island parrots
*Subfamily Psittrichasinae: one species, Pesquet&#x27;s parrot
*Subfamily Coracopsinae: one genus with several species
Family Psittaculidae, Asian and Australasian parrots, and lovebirds
*Subfamily Platycercinae
** Tribe Pezoporini: ground parrots and allies
** Tribe Platycercini: broad-tailed parrots
*Subfamily Psittacellinae: one genus (&quot;Psittacella&quot;) with several species
*Subfamily Loriinae
** Tribe Loriini: lories and lorikeets
** Tribe Melopsittacini: one species, the budgerigar
** Tribe Cyclopsittini: fig parrots
*Subfamily Agapornithinae: three genera
*Subfamily Psittaculinae
** Tribe Polytelini: three genera
** Tribe Psittaculini: Asian psittacines
** Tribe Micropsittini: pygmy parrots

<text>The king of Iraq () was Iraq&#x27;s head of state and monarch from 1921 to 1958. He served as the head of the Iraqi monarchy—the Hashemite dynasty. The king was addressed as His Majesty ().

==History==

In the aftermath of World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the three provinces (&quot;vilayets&quot;) of Ottoman Iraq came under the control of the United Kingdom. Under British occupation, the people rebelled and Iraq showed itself a hard land to govern. In order to establish a pro-British client regime, a dynasty of Hashemite kings from the Hejaz region was established, beginning with Faisal I who was the son of Hussein bin Ali. As a family originating in the Hejaz, the Hashemites was foreign to Iraq. The British Government appointed them as Iraq&#x27;s royal family after a plebiscite in 1921. The Hashemites were largely opposed by the Iraqi Shiites and Kurds. The Kingdom of Iraq existed until an Iraqi nationalist coup d&#x27;état in 1958 known as the 14 July Revolution established the Iraqi Republic.

<doc id="201253" wikidata="Q2369584" url="?curid=201253" title="Kornilov affair">
<text>The Kornilov affair, or the Kornilov putsch, was an attempted military coup d&#x27;état by the commander-in-chief of the Russian Army, General Lavr Kornilov, from 10 to 13 September 1917 (O.S., 28–31 August), against the Russian Provisional Government headed by Aleksander Kerensky and the Petrograd Soviet of Soldiers&#x27; and Workers&#x27; Deputies. The exact details and motivations of the Kornilov affair are unconfirmed due to the general confusion of all parties involved. Many historians have had to piece together varied historical accounts as a result.

==Background==

Following the February Revolution of 8–16 March 1917 (O.S. 23 February – 3 March), the Russian monarchy fell from power, and was replaced by a Provisional Government whose members came from various liberal and left-wing political parties, some previously represented in the Duma, and others in the Petrograd Soviet. However, the initial wave of support for the Provisional Government amongst the Russian people soon subsided and unrest grew, a result mainly of Russia&#x27;s continued participation in the First World War and the economic effects of the fighting on Russian society.

The unrest felt by the Russian people reached a peak with the Kerensky Offensive on 15 July 1917 (O.S. 1 July). Kerensky&#x27;s offensive was meant to boost the morale of the troops and reignite support for Russia&#x27;s participation in the war. The offensive ended up having the opposite effect. Troops and workers became frustrated with Russia&#x27;s continued involvement, which led to the July Days revolt.

The July Days took place in the Russian capital of Petrograd from 16 to 20 July (O.S. 3 to 7 July) and was a rebellion against the Provisional Government. The demonstrations during the July Days did not alleviate the frustrations of the Russian people and continued unrest throughout that summer sparked calls for more discipline and a stronger, more unified government. Unease also escalated amongst Russia&#x27;s businessmen and industrialists in the Provisional Government. Support for the restoration of order was strong even amongst the members of the Provisional Government.

Immediately following the July Days, Aleksander Kerensky became prime minister of the Provisional Government and swiftly appointed Kornilov the commander-in-chief of the Russian Army. With the help of officers of the Russian Army, Kornilov amongst them, he hoped to deliver a more unified form of government. The officers feared that ill-discipline amongst their troops accounted for the continued poor performance of the Russian Army in the war. They demanded the reintroduction of the death penalty on the front line as well as the abolition of the various soldiers&#x27; committees that had sprung up in the months following the Petrograd Soviet&#x27;s Order Number 1 on 1 March 1917 (O.S. 14 March). The officers, especially Kornilov, wanted to put an end to any signs of revolution in Russia, particularly in regard to the Bolsheviks. Kornilov mobilized his troops to Petrograd to address the revolutionary threat shortly after he was appointed commander-in-chief.

== The affair ==
While there have been multiple conflicting opinions on the specifics of how this event had come to be, as well as how it was carried out, one common fact was that, to &quot;restore peace in Petrograd&quot;, Kornilov had been organizing a force of soldiers to move into Petrograd and eliminate the Soviet. Whether Kornilov had done this as a means of imposing a military dictatorship after his success, or was simply acting under Kerensky&#x27;s orders, is not clear, but what is definite was that Kerensky had no intention of allowing Kornilov to enter Petrograd with an army, fearing the former possibility. In an effort to avoid this, on 10 September 1917 (O.S. 27 August), Kerensky had sent Kornilov a telegram informing him of his dismissal and ordering him to return to Petrograd. The telegram did not impede Kornilov&#x27;s progress towards Petrograd as intended, but instead most likely hastened his troops&#x27; advance as Kornilov, after reading the message, assumed that Petrograd had fallen under the control of the Bolsheviks.

Kornilov had the support of the British military attaché, Brigadier-General Alfred Knox, and Kerensky accused Knox of producing pro-Kornilov propaganda. Kerensky also claimed Lord Milner wrote him a letter expressing support for Kornilov.

Over the course of the next few days, as the Provisional Government tried to come up with a concrete plan to avert the oncoming attack, the Petrograd Soviet had taken measures to defend against Kornilov&#x27;s advancing troops. One of these measures was the creation of the Committee for Struggle Against Counterrevolution on 11 September 1917 (28 August Old Style). Those participating in the committee were representatives of the two national Soviet executive committees of workers and soldiers and of peasants, the Petrograd Soviet, the General Central Council of Trade Unions, and the Social Revolutionary (S. R.) and Menshevik parties. The most notable members of this committee were the Bolsheviks, who had a large support base among the lower class, and included organizers such as Leon Trotsky, who had been previously imprisoned but released at the behest of the Petrograd Soviet to assist in the organization of the defense of Petrograd.

The Soviet had performed several acts such as working with rail worker unions to impede Kornilov&#x27;s army&#x27;s progress towards Petrograd as well as infiltrating the army for the purpose of sabotage and convincing soldiers within the force to desert, all in an effort to halt and weaken the forces of Kornilov. In Petrograd the Soviet, most notably the Bolsheviks for reasons that were important later on, were given ammunition and arms in the event that Kornilov&#x27;s troops should arrive at Petrograd and combat be necessary. However this proved unnecessary because by 13 September 1917 (30 August Old Style) Kornilov&#x27;s army had lost a large number of soldiers and with no more support for Kornilov&#x27;s movement the affair had come to a bloodless end.

==Consequences==

After the failed coup, Kornilov was removed from his position as Commander-in-Chief and incarcerated in the Bykhov Fortress alongside 30 other army officers accused of involvement in the conspiracy. General Aleksandr Krymov commanded the forces that moved towards Petrograd before being stopped. Krymov surrendered and, after meeting with Kerensky, killed himself by shooting himself in the heart.

On 14 September 1917 (1 September old style), the Provisional Government proclaimed the establishment of the Russian Republic, formally abolishing what was left of the old monarchical system and creating a Provisional Council as temporary parliament, in preparation to the elections of a Constituent Assembly.

However, the Provisional Government had lost all credibility and soon crumbled. Shortly after Lenin seized power with the Bolshevik October Revolution of 7 November 1917 (25 October old style) Kornilov managed to escape from Bykhov Fortress and went on to establish the Volunteer Army, which fought the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. He was killed in battle against Bolshevik forces in the town of Ekaterinodar in April 1918.

The biggest beneficiary of the Kornilov affair was the Bolshevik Party, who enjoyed a revival in support and strength in the wake of the attempted coup. Kerensky released Bolsheviks who had been arrested during the July Days a few months earlier, when Vladimir Lenin was accused of being in the pay of the Germans and subsequently fled to Finland. Kerensky&#x27;s plea to the Petrograd Soviet for support had resulted in the rearmament of the Bolshevik Military Organization and the release of Bolshevik political prisoners, including Leon Trotsky. Though these weapons were not needed to fight off Kornilov&#x27;s advancing troops in August, they were kept by the Bolsheviks and used in their own successful armed October Revolution. Bolshevik support amongst the Russian public also increased following the Kornilov affair, a consequence of dissatisfaction with the Provisional Government&#x27;s handling of Kornilov&#x27;s attempted seizure of power. Following the October Revolution, Lenin and the Bolsheviks seized power and the Provisional Government that Kornilov was a part of ceased to exist. The fragments of the Provisional Government were a pivotal force in the Russian Civil War that occurred in response to Lenin&#x27;s seizure of power.

Despite the officer corps&#x27; refusal to participate in Kornilov&#x27;s mutiny, they were angry with the punishment Kerensky gave him, as well as Kerensky&#x27;s accommodation of the left and his arrest of prominent generals. This would later come back to haunt Kerensky as the military did not heed his request to defend the government when the Bolsheviks attacked in the October Revolution in 1917.

==Historiography==

Several schools of thought surrounding the Kornilov affair offer contrasting interpretations and have provoked debate among historians. Mark D. Steinberg presents the conflicting beliefs and political opinions on the Kornilov Affair. He elaborates by stating that the event was &quot;a strange mixture of conspiracy and confusion&quot;. Once the attempt was halted, many citizens expressed skeptical thoughts regarding what actually happened between Kornilov and Kerensky. On the left side, those who defended Kornilov believed that Kerensky had intentionally planned the seizure of power, but publicly disapproved of it to be the savior figure in the midst of turmoil. Another aspect that Steinberg highlights is that the right believed that Kerensky had turned against Kornilov. Thus, the opinions regarding this affair further perpetuated separation between the right and left political parties.

When discussing the events that led up to the affair, Steinberg analyzes the involvement of former Provisional Government minister Vladimir Nikolaevich Lvov. Prior to the affair taking place, Lvov identified himself to Kornilov as an &quot;emissary for the prime minister,&quot; which was not his true occupation. Through his interaction with Kornilov, Lvov gained the knowledge that Kornilov wanted to create a stronger, more unified government where he had more of a voice. Then, Lvov went on to express these desires to Kerensky, but Kerensky viewed this information as a threatening proposal to take over the government. From there, Kerensky prepared to defend the capital against Kornilov&#x27;s advancing troops and aspirations of gaining power. It can be considered that, through communicating with the help of Lvov, the different intentions of both Kornilov and Kerensky were miscommunicated or misrepresented in conversation, which perpetuated the attempted government seizure of power.

One take on the Kornilov affair was put forward by Aleksander Kerensky himself, the main target of the coup. In the years after the event, Kerensky described the affair as a right-wing conspiracy that &quot;...developed slowly, systematically, with cool calculation of all the factors involved affecting its possible success or failure.&quot; Kerensky posited that Kornilov himself was drawn into this conspiracy long after the preparatory work had been completed. In a 1966 interview with Soviet journalist Genrikh Borovik, Kerensky further elaborated on his theory by stating that Winston Churchill had played a central role in the conspiracy.

According to the British historian John Keegan, Kornilov was maneuvered by others into attempting the coup, but he does not say who those others were. An earlier historian, AJP Taylor, believed that Kerensky encouraged the coup until he realized that Kornilov intended to destroy both the Bolsheviks and any trace of democracy including Kerensky himself.

The American historian Richard Pipes put forward another interpretation of the event in his work &quot;The Russian Revolution: 1899–1919&quot;. Pipes argued that, far from there being a Kornilov plot, there was in fact a &quot;&#x27;Kerensky plot&#x27; engineered to discredit the general as the ringleader of an imaginary but widely anticipated counter-revolution, the suppression of which would elevate the Prime Minister to a position of unrivalled popularity and power, enabling him to meet the growing threat from the Bolsheviks.&quot;

<text>A cockatoo is any of the 21 species of parrots belonging to the family Cacatuidae, the only family in the superfamily Cacatuoidea. Along with the Psittacoidea (true parrots) and the Strigopoidea (large New Zealand parrots), they make up the order Psittaciformes. The family has a mainly Australasian distribution, ranging from the Philippines and the eastern Indonesian islands of Wallacea to New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Australia. 

Cockatoos are recognisable by their prominent crests and curved bills. Their plumage is generally less colourful than that of other parrots, being mainly white, grey, or black and often with coloured features in the crest, cheeks, or tail. On average, they are larger than other parrots; however, the cockatiel, the smallest cockatoo species, is medium-sized. The phylogenetic position of the cockatiel remains unresolved, except that it is one of the earliest offshoots of the cockatoo lineage. The remaining species are in two main clades. The five large black-coloured cockatoos of the genus &quot;Calyptorhynchus&quot; form one branch. The second and larger branch is formed by the genus &quot;Cacatua&quot;, comprising 12 species of white-plumaged cockatoos and three monotypic genera that branched off earlier, namely the pink and grey galah, the mainly grey gang-gang cockatoo and the large black-plumaged palm cockatoo.

Cockatoos prefer to eat seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers, and insects. They often feed in large flocks, particularly when ground-feeding. Cockatoos are monogamous and nest in tree hollows. Some cockatoo species have been adversely affected by habitat loss, particularly from a shortage of suitable nesting hollows after large, mature trees are cleared; conversely, some species have adapted well to human changes and are considered agricultural pests.

Cockatoos are popular birds in aviculture, but their needs are difficult to meet. The cockatiel is the easiest cockatoo species to maintain and is by far the most frequently kept in captivity. White cockatoos are more commonly found in captivity than black cockatoos. Illegal trade in wild-caught birds contributes to the decline of some cockatoo species in the wild.

==Etymology==

The word cockatoo dates from the 17th century and is derived from Dutch &quot;kaketoe&quot;, which in turn is from the Indonesian/Malay &quot;kakatua&quot;. Seventeenth-century variants include cacato, cockatoon and crockadore, and cokato, cocatore and were used in the 18th century. The derivation has also been used for the family and generic names Cacatuidae and &quot;Cacatua&quot;, respectively.

In Australian slang or vernacular speech, a person who is assigned to keep watch while others undertake clandestine or illegal activities, particularly gambling, may be referred to as a &quot;cockatoo&quot;. Proprietors of small agricultural undertakings are often jocularly or slightly disparagingly referred to as &quot;cocky farmers&quot;.

==Taxonomy==

The cockatoos were first defined as a subfamily Cacatuinae within the parrot family Psittacidae by English naturalist George Robert Gray in 1840, with &quot;Cacatua&quot; the first listed and type genus. This group has alternately been considered as either a full or subfamily by different authorities. American ornithologist James Lee Peters in his 1937 &quot;Check-list of Birds of the World&quot; and Sibley and Monroe in 1990 maintained it as a subfamily, while parrot expert Joseph Forshaw classified it as a family in 1973. Subsequent molecular studies indicate that the earliest offshoot from the original parrot ancestors were the New Zealand parrots of the family Strigopidae, and following this the cockatoos, now a well-defined group or clade, split off from the remaining parrots, which then radiated across the Southern Hemisphere and diversified into the many species of parrots, parakeets, macaws, lories, lorikeets, lovebirds and other true parrots of the superfamily Psittacoidea.

The relationships among various cockatoo genera are largely resolved, although the placement of the cockatiel (&quot;Nymphicus hollandicus&quot;) at the base of the cockatoos remains uncertain. The cockatiel is alternatively placed basal to all other cockatoo species, as the sister taxon to the black cockatoo species of the genus &quot;Calyptorhynchus&quot; or as the sister taxon to a clade consisting of the white and pink cockatoo genera as well as the palm cockatoo. The remaining species are within two main clades, one consisting of the black species of the genus &quot;Calyptorhynchus&quot; while the other contains the remaining species. According to most authorities, the second clade includes the black palm cockatoo (&quot;Probosciger&quot;), the grey and reddish galah (&quot;Eolophus&quot;), and the gang-gang cockatoo (&quot;Callocephalon&quot;), although &quot;Probosciger&quot; is sometimes placed basal to all other species. The remaining species are mainly white or slightly pinkish and all belong to the genus &quot;Cacatua&quot;. The genera &quot;Eolophus&quot; and &quot;Cacatua&quot; are hypomelanistic. The genus &quot;Cacatua&quot; is further subdivided into the subgenera &quot;Licmetis&quot;, commonly known as corellas, and &quot;Cacatua&quot;, referred to as white cockatoos. Confusingly, the term &quot;white cockatoo&quot; has also been applied to the whole genus. The five cockatoo species of the genus &quot;Calyptorhynchus&quot; are commonly known as black cockatoos, and are divided into two subgenera—&quot;Calyptorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Zanda&quot;. The former group are sexually dichromatic, with the females having prominently barred plumage. The two are also distinguished by differences in the food-begging calls of juveniles.

The fossil record of cockatoos is even more limited than that of parrots in general, with only one truly ancient cockatoo fossil known: a species of &quot;Cacatua&quot;, most probably subgenus &quot;Licmetis&quot;, found in Early Miocene (16–23 million years ago) deposits of Riversleigh, Australia. Although fragmentary, the remains are similar to the western corella and the galah. In Melanesia, subfossil bones of &quot;Cacatua&quot; species which apparently did not survive early human settlement have been found on New Caledonia and New Ireland. The bearing of these fossils on cockatoo evolution and phylogeny is fairly limited, although the Riversleigh fossil does allow tentative dating of the divergence of subfamilies.

==Morphology==

The cockatoos are generally medium to large parrots of stocky build, which range from in length and in weight; however, one species, the cockatiel, is considerably smaller and slimmer than the other species, being long (including its long pointed tail feathers) and in weight. The movable headcrest, which is present in all cockatoos, is spectacular in many species; it is raised when the bird lands from flying or when it is aroused. Cockatoos share many features with other parrots, including the characteristic curved beak shape and a zygodactyl foot, with the two middle toes forward and the two outer toes backward. They differ in the presence of an erectile crest and their lack of the Dyck texture feather composition which causes the bright blues and greens seen in true parrots.

Like other parrots, cockatoos have short legs, strong claws, a waddling gait and often use their strong bill as a third limb when climbing through branches. They generally have long broad wings used in rapid flight, with speeds up to being recorded for galahs. The members of the genus &quot;Calyptorhynchus&quot; and larger white cockatoos, such as the sulphur-crested cockatoo and the pink cockatoo, have shorter, rounder wings and a more leisurely flight.

Cockatoos have a large bill, which is kept sharp by rasping the two jaws together when resting. The bill is complemented by a large muscular tongue which helps manipulate seeds inside the bill so that they can be de-husked before eating. During the de-husking, the lower jaw applies the pressure, the tongue holds the seed in place and the upper jaw acts as an anvil. The eye region of the skull is reinforced to support muscles which move the jaws sideways. The bills of male cockatoos are generally slightly larger than those of their female counterparts, but this size difference is quite marked in the palm cockatoo.

The plumage of the cockatoos is less brightly coloured than that of the other parrots, with species generally being either black, grey or white. Many species have smaller areas of colour on their plumage, often yellow, pink and red, usually on the crest or tail. The galah and Major Mitchell&#x27;s cockatoo are more broadly coloured in pink tones. Several species have a brightly coloured bare area around the eye and face known as a periophthalmic ring; the large red patch of bare skin of the palm cockatoo is the most extensive and covers some of the face, while it is more restricted in some other species of white cockatoo, notably the corellas and blue-eyed cockatoo. The plumage of males and females is similar in most species. The plumage of the female cockatiel is duller than the male, but the most marked sexual dimorphism occurs in the gang-gang cockatoo and the two species of black cockatoos in the subgenus &quot;Calyptorhynchus&quot;, namely the red-tailed and glossy black cockatoos. The iris colour differs in a few species, being pink or red in the female galah and the pink cockatoo and red-brown in some other female white cockatoo species. The males all have dark brown irises.

Cockatoos maintain their plumage with frequent preening throughout the day. They remove dirt and oil and realign feather barbs by nibbling their feathers. They also preen other birds&#x27; feathers that are otherwise hard to get at. Cockatoos produce preen-oil from a gland on their lower back and apply it by wiping their plumage with their heads or already oiled feathers. Powder-down is produced by specialised feathers in the lumbar region and distributed by the preening cockatoo all over the plumage.

Moulting is very slow and complex. Black cockatoos appear to replace their flight feathers one at a time, their moult taking two years to complete. This process is much shorter in other species, such as the galah and long-billed corella, which each take around six months to replace all their flight feathers.

===Voice===
The vocalisations of cockatoos are loud and harsh. They serve a number of functions, including allowing individuals to recognize one another, alerting others of predators, indicating individual moods, maintaining the cohesion of a flock and as warnings when defending nests. The use of calls and number of specific calls varies by species; the Carnaby&#x27;s black cockatoo has as many as 15 types of call, whereas others, such as the pink cockatoo, have fewer. Some, like the gang-gang cockatoo, are comparatively quiet but do have softer growling calls when feeding. In addition to vocalisations, palm cockatoos communicate over large distances by drumming on a dead branch with a stick. Cockatoo species also make a characteristic hissing sound when threatened.

==Distribution and habitat==

Cockatoos have a much more restricted range than the true parrots, occurring naturally only in Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and some Pacific regions. Eleven of the 21 species exist in the wild only in Australia, while seven species occur only in the islands of the Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. No cockatoo species are found in Borneo, despite their presence on nearby Palawan and Sulawesi or many Pacific islands, although fossil remains have been recorded from New Caledonia.

Three species occur in both New Guinea and Australia. Some species have widespread distributions, with the galah, for example, occurring over most of Australia, whereas other species have tiny distributions, confined to a small part of the continent, such as the Baudin&#x27;s black cockatoo of Western Australia or to a small island group, such as the Tanimbar corella, which is restricted to the Tanimbar Islands of Indonesia. Some cockatoos have been introduced accidentally to areas outside their natural range such as New Zealand, Singapore, and Palau, while two Australian corella species have been introduced to parts of the continent where they are not native.

Cockatoos occupy a wide range of habitats from forests in subalpine regions to mangroves. However, no species is found in all types of habitat. The most widespread species, such as the galah and cockatiel, are open-country specialists that feed on grass seeds. They are often highly mobile fast flyers and are nomadic. Flocks of birds move across large areas of the inland, locating and feeding on seed and other food sources. Drought may force flocks from more arid areas to move further into farming areas. Other cockatoo species, such as the glossy black cockatoo, inhabit woodlands, rainforests, shrublands and even alpine forests. The red-vented cockatoo inhabits mangroves and its absence from northern Luzon may be related to the lack of mangrove forests there. Forest-dwelling cockatoos are generally sedentary, as the food supply is more stable and predictable. Several species have adapted well to human modified habitats and are found in agricultural areas and even busy cities.

==Behaviour==

Cockatoos are diurnal and require daylight to find their food. They are not early risers, instead waiting until the sun has warmed their roosting sites before feeding. All species are generally highly social and roost, forage and travel in colourful and noisy flocks. These vary in size depending on availability of food; in times of plenty, flocks are small and number a hundred birds or less, while in droughts or other times of adversity, they may swell up to contain thousands or even tens of thousands of birds; one record from the Kimberley noted a flock of 32,000 little corellas. Species that inhabit open country form larger flocks than those of forested areas.

Some species require roosting sites that are located near drinking sites; other species travel great distances between the roosting and feeding sites. Cockatoos have several characteristic methods of bathing; they may hang upside down or fly about in the rain or flutter in wet leaves in the canopy. Cockatoos have a preferred &quot;footedness&quot; analogous to human handedness. Most species are left-footed with 87–100% of individuals using their left feet to eat, but a few species favor their right foot.

===Breeding===

Cockatoos are monogamous breeders, with pair bonds that can last many years. Many birds pair up in flocks before they reach sexual maturity and delay breeding for a year at least. Females breed for the first time anywhere from three to seven years of age and males are often older. Sexual maturity is delayed so birds can develop the skills for raising and parenting young, which is prolonged compared with other birds; the young of some species remain with their parents for up to a year. Cockatoos may also display site fidelity, returning to the same nesting sites in consecutive years. Courtship is generally simple, particularly for established pairs, with the black cockatoos alone engaging in courtship feeding. Established pairs do engage in preening each other, but all forms of courtship drop off after incubation begins, possibly due to the strength of the pair-bond.

Like most parrots, the cockatoos are cavity nesters, nesting in holes in trees, which they are unable to excavate themselves. These hollows are formed from decay or destruction of wood by branches breaking off, fungi or insects such as termites or even woodpeckers where their ranges overlap. In many places these holes are scarce and the source of competition, both with other members of the same species and with other species and types of animal. In general, cockatoos choose hollows only a little larger than themselves, hence different-sized species nest in holes of corresponding (and different) sizes. If given the opportunity, cockatoos prefer nesting over above the ground and close to water and food.

The nesting hollows are lined with sticks, wood chips and branches with leaves. The eggs of cockatoos are oval and initially white, as their location makes camouflage unnecessary. However, they do become discoloured over the course of incubation. They range in size from in the palm and red-tailed black cockatoos, to in the cockatiel. Clutch size varies within the family, with the palm cockatoo and some other larger cockatoos laying only a single egg and the smaller species laying anywhere between two and eight eggs. Food supply also plays a role in clutch size. Some species can lay a second clutch if the first fails. Around 20% of eggs laid are infertile. The cockatoos&#x27; incubation and brooding responsibilities may either be undertaken by the female alone in the case of the black cockatoos or shared amongst the sexes as happens in the other species. In the case of the black cockatoos, the female is provisioned by the male several times a day. The young of all species are born covered in yellowish down, bar the palm cockatoo, whose young are born naked. Cockatoo incubation times are dependent on species size, with the smaller cockatiels having a period of around 20 days and the larger Carnaby&#x27;s black cockatoo incubating its eggs for up to 29 days.

The nestling period also varies by species size, with larger species having longer nestling periods. It is also affected by season and environmental factors and by competition with siblings in species with clutch sizes greater than one. Much of what is known about the nestling period of some species is dependent on aviary studies – aviary cockatiels can fledge after 5 weeks and the large palm cockatoos after 11 weeks. During this period, the young become covered in juvenile plumage while remaining in the hollow. Wings and tail feathers are slow to grow initially but more rapid as the primary feathers appear. Nestlings quickly reach about 80–90% of adult weight about two-thirds of the time through this period, plateauing before they leave the hollow; they fledge at this weight with wing and tail feathers still to grow a little before reaching adult dimensions. Growth rate of the young, as well as numbers fledged, are adversely impacted by reduced food supply and poor weather conditions.

===Diet and feeding===

Cockatoos are versatile feeders and consume a range of mainly vegetable food items. Seeds form a large part of the diet of all species; these are opened with their large and powerful bills. The galahs, corellas and some of the black cockatoos feed primarily on the ground; others feed mostly in trees. The ground-feeding species tend to forage in flocks, which form tight, squabbling groups where seeds are concentrated and dispersed lines where food is more sparsely distributed; they also prefer open areas where visibility is good. The western and long-billed corellas have elongated bills to excavate tubers and roots and the pink cockatoo walks in a circle around the doublegee (&quot;Emex australis&quot;) to twist out and remove the underground parts.

Many species forage for food in the canopy of trees, taking advantage of serotiny (the storage of a large supply of seed in cones or gumnuts by plant genera such as &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, &quot;Banksia&quot; and &quot;Hakea&quot;), a natural feature of the Australian landscape in dryer regions. These woody fruiting bodies are inaccessible to many species and harvested in the main by parrots, cockatoos and rodents in more tropical regions. The larger cones can be opened by the large bills of cockatoos but are too strong for smaller animals. Many nuts and fruits lie on the end of small branches which are unable to support the weight of the foraging cockatoo, which instead bends the branch towards itself and holds it with its foot.

While some cockatoos are generalists taking a wide range of foods, others are specialists. The glossy black cockatoo specialises in the cones of trees of the genus &quot;Allocasuarina&quot;, preferring a single species, &quot;A. verticillata&quot;. It holds the cones in its foot and shreds them with its powerful bill before removing the seeds with its tongue. Some species take large numbers of insects, particularly when breeding; in fact the bulk of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo&#x27;s diet is made up of insects. The large bill is used in order to extract grubs and larvae from rotting wood. The amount of time cockatoos have to spend foraging varies with the season. During times of plenty they may need to feed for only a few hours in the day, in the morning and evening, then spend the rest of the day roosting or preening in trees, but during the winter most of the day may be spent foraging. The birds have increased nutritional requirements during the breeding season, so they spend more time foraging for food during this time. Cockatoos have large crops, which allow them to store and digest food for some time after retiring to a tree.

===Predators and threats===
The peregrine falcon and little eagle have been reported taking galahs and the wedge-tailed eagle has been observed killing a sulphur-crested cockatoo. Eggs and nestlings are vulnerable to many hazards. Various species of monitor lizard (&quot;Varanus&quot;) are able to climb trees and enter hollows. Other predators recorded include the spotted wood owl on Rasa Island in the Philippines; the amethystine python, black butcherbird and rodents including the giant white-tailed rat in Cape York; and brushtail possum on Kangaroo Island. Furthermore, galahs and little corellas competing for nesting space with the glossy black cockatoo on Kangaroo Island have been recorded killing nestlings of the latter species there. Severe storms may also flood hollows drowning the young and termite or borer activity may lead to the internal collapse of nests.

Like other parrots, cockatoos can be afflicted by psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD). The viral infection causes feather loss and beak malformation and reduces the bird&#x27;s overall immunity. Particularly prevalent in sulphur-crested cockatoos, little corellas and galahs, it has been recorded in 14 species of cockatoo to date. Although unlikely to significantly impact on large, healthy populations of birds in the wild, PBFD may pose a high risk to smaller stressed populations.

A white cockatoo and a sulphur-crested cockatoo were found to be infected with the protozoon &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; and another sulphur-crested cockatoo had the malaria parasite &quot;Plasmodium&quot; on analysis of faecal samples at Almuñecar ornithological garden in Granada in Spain. Like amazon parrots and macaws, cockatoos frequently develop cloacal papillomas. The relationship with malignancy is unknown, as is the cause, although a parrot papilloma virus has been isolated from a grey parrot with the condition.

===Social learning===
Cockatoos have been shown to learn new skills through social interaction. In New South Wales, researchers and citizen scientists were able to track the spread of lid-flipping skills as cockatoos learned from each other to open garbage bins. Bin-opening spread more quickly to neighbouring suburbs than suburbs further away. In addition, birds in different areas developed their own variants for accomplishing the complex task.

==Relationship with humans==

Human activities have had positive effects on some species of cockatoo and negative effects on others. Many species of open country have benefited greatly from anthropogenic changes to the landscape, with the great increase in reliable seed food sources, and available water contributing to their survival, as well as their adaption to a diet including foreign foodstuffs. This benefit appears to be restricted to Australian species, as cockatoos favouring open country outside Australia have not become more abundant. Predominantly forest-dwelling species have suffered greatly from habitat destruction; in the main, they appear to have a more specialised diet and have not been able to incorporate exotic food into their diet. A notable exception is the yellow-tailed black cockatoo in eastern Australia.

===Pests===
Several species of cockatoo can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation and the provision of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood, but in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western redcedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.

In 1995 the Government of the state of Victoria published a report on problems caused by long-billed corellas, sulphur-crested cockatoos and galahs, three species which, along with the little corella, have large and growing populations, having benefited from anthropogenic changes to the landscape. Subsequent to the findings and publication of the report, these three species were declared unprotected by a Governor in Council Order under certain conditions and are allowed to be killed where serious damage is being caused by them to trees, vineyards, orchards, recreational reserves and commercial crops. Damage covered by the report included not only that to cereal crops, fruit and nut orchards and some kinds of vegetable crops but also to houses and communications equipment. The little corella is a declared pest of agriculture in Western Australia, where it is an aviculturally introduced species. The birds damage sorghum, maize, sunflower, chickpeas and other crops. They also defoliate amenity trees in parks and gardens, dig for edible roots and corms on sports grounds and race tracks, as well as chew wiring and household fittings. In South Australia, where flocks can number several thousand birds and the species is listed as unprotected, they are accused of defoliating red gums and other native or ornamental trees used for roosting, damaging tarpaulins on grain bunkers, wiring and flashing on buildings, taking grain from newly seeded paddocks and creating a noise nuisance.

Several rare species and subspecies, too, have been recorded as causing problems. The Carnaby&#x27;s black cockatoo, a threatened Western Australian endemic, has been considered a pest in pine plantations where the birds chew off the leading shoots of growing pine trees, resulting in bent trunks and reduced timber value. They are also known to damage nut and fruit crops, and have learnt to exploit canola crops. The Baudin&#x27;s black cockatoo, also endemic to the south-west of Western Australia, can be a pest in apple and pear orchards where it destroys the fruit to extract the seeds. Muir&#x27;s corella, the nominate subspecies of the western corella, is also a declared pest of agriculture in Western Australia, as well as being nationally vulnerable and listed under state legislation as being &quot;rare or likely to become extinct&quot;.

===Status and conservation===
According to the IUCN and BirdLife International, seven species of cockatoo are considered to be vulnerable or worse and one is considered to be near-threatened. Of these, two species—the red-vented cockatoo and the yellow-crested cockatoo—are considered to be critically endangered.

The principal threats to cockatoos are habitat loss and the wildlife trade. All cockatoos are dependent on trees for nesting and are vulnerable to their loss; in addition many species have specialised habitat requirements or live on small islands and have naturally small ranges, making them vulnerable to the loss of these habitats. Cockatoos are popular as pets and the capture and trade has threatened some species; between 1983 and 1990, 66,654 recorded salmon-crested cockatoos were exported from Indonesia, a figure that does not include the number of birds caught for the domestic trade or that were exported illegally. The capture of many species has subsequently been banned but the trade continues illegally. Birds are put in crates or bamboo tubing and conveyed on boats out of Indonesia and the Philippines. Not only are the rare species smuggled out of Indonesia but also common and rare cockatoos alike are smuggled out of Australia; birds are sedated, covered in nylon stockings and packed into PVC tubing which is then placed in unaccompanied luggage on international flights. Mortality is significant (30%) and eggs, more easily hidden on the bodies of smugglers on flights, are increasingly smuggled instead. Trafficking is thought to be run by organised gangs, who also trade Australian species for overseas species such as macaws coming the other way.

All species of cockatoo except the cockatiel are protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which restricts import and export of wild-caught parrots to special licensed purposes. Five cockatoo species (including all subspecies)—the Tanimbar corella (&quot;Cacatua goffiniana&quot;), red-vented cockatoo (&quot;Cacatua haematuropygia&quot;), Moluccan cockatoo (&quot;Cacatua moluccensis&quot;), yellow-crested cockatoo (&quot;Cacatua sulphurea&quot;) and palm cockatoo (&quot;Probosciger aterrimus&quot;)—are protected on the CITES Appendix I list. With the exception of the cockatiel, all remaining cockatoo species are protected on the CITES Appendix II list.

===Aviculture===

Kept for their appearance, intelligence, and engaging personalities, cockatoos can nonetheless be problematic pets or companion parrots. Generally, they are not good at mimicking human speech, although the little corella is a renowned talker. As social animals, wild cockatoos have been known to learn human speech from ex-captive birds that have integrated into a flock. Their care is best provided by those experienced in keeping parrots. Cockatoos are social animals and their social needs are difficult to cater for, and they can suffer if kept in a cage on their own for long periods of time.

The cockatiel is by far the cockatoo species most frequently kept in captivity. Among U.S. bird keepers that participated in a survey by APPMA in 2003/04, 39% had cockatiels, as opposed to only 3% that had (other) cockatoo species. The white cockatoos are more often encountered in aviculture than the black cockatoos. Black cockatoos are rarely seen in European zoos due to export restrictions on Australian wildlife but birds seized by governments have been loaned.

Cockatoos are often very affectionate with their owner and at times other people but can demand a great deal of attention. It has been suggested that cockatoos&#x27; need for physical attention from humans may stem from suboptimal rearing techniques – young birds being removed from parental care for hand-rearing too early in the belief that this will produce a more suitable pet, leading the bird to seek out physical contact from humans as a parent substitute. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they must be given a steady supply of objects to tinker with, chew, dismantle and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, which can lead to stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather plucking is likely to stem from psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The salmon-crested and white cockatoo species are particular offenders. All cockatoos have a fine powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin&#x27;s and quieter Galah&#x27;s cockatoos are much easier to keep as pets. The cockatiel is one of the most popular and easiest parrots to keep as a pet, and many colour mutations are available in aviculture.
Larger cockatoos can live 30 to 70 years depending on the species, or occasionally longer, and cockatiels can live for about 20 years. As pets they require a long-term commitment from their owners. Their longevity is considered a positive trait as it reduces instances of the loss of a pet. The oldest cockatoo in captivity was a pink cockatoo named Cookie, residing at Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, which lived to be 83 years old (1933–2016). A salmon-crested cockatoo named King Tut who resided at the San Diego Zoo was nearly 69 when he died in 1990 and a palm cockatoo reached 56 in London Zoo in 2000. However, anecdotal reports describe birds of much greater ages. Cocky Bennett of Tom Ugly&#x27;s Point in Sydney was a celebrated sulphur-crested cockatoo who was reported to have reached an age of 100 years or more. He had lost his feathers and was naked for much of his life. A palm cockatoo was reported to have reached 80 or 90 years of age in an Australian zoo, and a little corella that was removed from a nest in central Australia in 1904 was reported still alive in the late 1970s. In February 2010, a white cockatoo named Arthur was claimed to be 90 years old; he had lived with a family for generations in Dalaguete, Cebu, before being taken to Cebu City Zoo.

Trained cockatoos are sometimes seen in bird shows in zoos. They are generally less motivated by food than other birds; some may respond more to petting or praise than food. Cockatoos can often be taught to wear a parrot harness, enabling their owners to take them outdoors. Cockatoos have been used in animal-assisted therapy, generally in nursing homes.

Cockatoos often have pronounced responses to musical sounds and numerous videos exist showing the birds dancing to popular music. Research conducted in 2008 with an Eleonora cockatoo named Snowball had indicated that this particular individual is indeed capable of beat induction—perceiving human-created music and synchronizing his body movements to the beat.

===Culture===

The earliest European depiction of a cockatoo is in the falconry book &quot;De arte venandi cum avibus&quot;, written by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. The next European depiction of a cockatoo, previously thought to be the earliest, is present in the 1496 painting by Andrea Mantegna titled Madonna della Vittoria. Later examples were painted by Hungarian artist Jakob Bogdani (1660–1724), who resided in Amsterdam from 1683 and then England, and appeared with numerous other birds in the bird pieces of the Dutch painter Melchior d&#x27;Hondecoeter (1636–1695). A cockatoo is the unlucky subject in &quot;An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump&quot; by English artist Joseph Wright of Derby, its fate unclear in the painting. Cockatoos were among the many Australian plants and animals which featured in decorative motifs in Federation architecture of the early 20th century. A visit to a Camden Town pet shop in 1958 inspired English painter William Roberts to paint &quot;The Cockatoos&quot;, in the collection of the Tate Gallery. American artist and sculptor Joseph Cornell was known for placing cutout paper cockatoos in his works.

The government of the Australian Capital Territory adopted the gang-gang cockatoo as its official faunal emblem on 27 February 1997. The short-lived budget airline Impulse Airlines featured a sulphur-crested cockatoo on its corporate livery (and aeroplanes). The palm cockatoo, which has a unique beak and face colouration, is used as a symbol by the World Parrot Trust.

Two 1970s police dramas featured protagonists with pet cockatoos. In the 1973 film &quot;Serpico&quot;, Al Pacino&#x27;s character had a pet white cockatoo and the television show &quot;Baretta&quot; saw Robert Blake&#x27;s character with Fred the Triton cockatoo. The popularity of the latter show saw a corresponding rise in popularity of cockatoos as pets in the late 1970s. Cockatoos have been used frequently in advertising; a cockatoo appeared in a &#x27;cheeky&#x27; (and later toned-down) 2008 advertising campaign for Cockatoo Ridge Wineries.

===Intelligence===
A team of scientists from Oxford University, the University of Vienna and the Max Planck Institute conducted tests on ten untrained Tanimbar corellas (&quot;Cacatua goffiniana&quot;), and found that they were able to solve complex mechanical puzzles.

<text>Westphalian or Westfalish (Standard High German: &#x27;, [[Dutch language|Standard Dutch]]:&#x27;) is one of the major dialect groups of Low German. Its most salient feature is its diphthongization (rising diphthongs). For example, speakers say () instead of or for &quot;to eat&quot;. (There is also a difference in the use of consonants &quot;within&quot; the Westphalian dialects: North of the Wiehengebirge, people tend to use unvoiced consonants, whereas south of the Wiehengebirge they tend to use the voiced equivalents, e.g. &gt; .)

The Westphalian dialect region includes the north-eastern part of North Rhine-Westphalia, i.e. the former Prussian province of Westphalia, without Siegerland and Wittgenstein, but including the southern part of former government district Weser-Ems (e.g. the region around Osnabrück and the landscape of Emsland in modern Lower Saxony).

Traditionally, all Dutch Low Saxon dialects are considered Westphalian, with the notable exception of Gronings, which is grouped with the Northern Low Saxon and Friso-Saxon dialects. The rising diphthongisation is still noticeable in the dialects of Rijssen, Enter and Vriezenveen. In a band from southeast Twente to northwest Twente the diphtongisation still happens before the consonants v, g and z. Vriezenveen furthermore preserved the diphtongisations in words like to eat, to hope and kitchen. In other areas of Dutch Low Saxon the breaking was monophthongized and then highered and lengthened, resulting in different development stadia away from the breaking depending on the area. 

==Varieties ==
Among the Westphalian language there are different subgroups of dialects:
* Westmünsterländisch
* Münsterländisch
* South Westphalian ()
* East Westphalian () in East Westphalia (possibly including the dialect of Osnabrück)

Westphalian dialects in the Netherlands:
* Drèents
* Urkers
* Stellingwarfs
* Sallands
* Twents
* Achterhoeks
* Veluws

Westphalian has many lexical similarities and other proximities to Eastphalian, extending to the East and slightly to the North of the area where Westphalian is spoken.

==Status==

German Westphalian is currently spoken mostly by elderly people. The majority of the inhabitants of Westphalia proper speak (regionally coloured) standard German. This accent, however, does not stand out as much as for example Bavarian, because Westphalia is closer to the Hanover region, whose speech variety is generally considered to be standard modern German.

The Low Saxon dialects in the bordering Twente and Achterhoek regions in the east of the Netherlands are traditionally classified as Westphalian dialects, albeit with some notable traits from Standard Dutch. A 2005 study showed 62% of the population of Twente spoke the language at home or together with Dutch, and efforts are made to insert the language into the local school curriculum.

One of the reasons for the diminishing use of Westphalian in Germany is the rigorous enforcement of German-only policies in traditionally Low German-speaking areas during the 18th century. Westphalian, and Low German in general, unlike many of the High German dialects, were too distant from standard German to be considered dialects and were therefore not tolerated and efforts were made to ban them. In an extreme case, Hannover and its hinterland were forced to adopt rather unnaturally a form of German based on the written standard.

Westphalian was spoken in Kruppwerke up to the 19th century.

Nevertheless, the Westphalian regiolect of Standard High German includes some words that originate from the dying Westphalian dialects, which are otherwise unintelligible for other German speakers from outside Westphalia. Examples include &quot;Pölter&quot; &quot;pyjamas/pajamas&quot;, &quot;Plörre&quot; &quot;dirty liquid&quot;, and &quot;Mötke&quot; &quot;mud, dirt&quot;.

<doc id="201265" wikidata="Q348780" url="?curid=201265" title="Douglas Bader">
<text>Group Captain Sir Douglas Robert Steuart Bader, (; 21 February 1910 – 5 September 1982) was a Royal Air Force flying ace during the Second World War. He was credited with 22 aerial victories, four shared victories, six probables, one shared probable and 11 enemy aircraft damaged.

Bader joined the RAF in 1928, and was commissioned in 1930. In December 1931, while attempting some aerobatics, he crashed and lost the lower part of both his legs. Having been on the brink of death, he recovered, retook flight training, passed his check flights and then requested reactivation as a pilot. Although there were no regulations applicable to his situation, he was retired against his will on medical grounds.

After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, however, Bader returned to the RAF and was accepted as a pilot. He scored his first victories over Dunkirk during the Battle of France in 1940. He then took part in the Battle of Britain and became a friend and supporter of Air Vice Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory and his &quot;Big Wing&quot; experiments.

In August 1941, Bader out over German-occupied France and was captured. Soon afterwards, he met and was befriended by Adolf Galland, a prominent German fighter ace. Despite his disability, Bader made a number of escape attempts and was eventually sent to the prisoner-of-war camp at Colditz Castle. He remained there until April 1945 when the camp was liberated by the First United States Army.

Bader left the RAF permanently in February 1946 and resumed his career in the oil industry. During the 1950s, a book and a film, &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot;, chronicled his life and RAF career to the end of the Second World War. Bader campaigned for disabled people and in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours 1976 was appointed a Knight Bachelor &quot;for services to disabled people&quot;. He continued to fly until ill health forced him to stop in 1979. Bader died, aged 72, on 5 September 1982, after a heart attack.

==Early years==

===Childhood and education===
Bader was born on 21 February 1910 in St John&#x27;s Wood, London, the second son of Major Frederick Roberts Bader (1867–1922), a civil engineer, and his wife Jessie Scott MacKenzie. His first two years were spent with McCann relatives on the Isle of Man while his father, accompanied by Bader&#x27;s mother and older brother Frederick (named after his father but called &#x27;Derick&#x27; to distinguish the two), returned to his work in India after the birth of his son.

At the age of two, Bader joined his parents in India for a year. When his father resigned from his job in 1913, the family moved back to London and settled in Kew. Bader&#x27;s father saw action in the First World War in the Royal Engineers, and was wounded in action in 1917. He remained in France after the war, where, having attained the rank of major, he died in 1922 of complications from those wounds in a hospital in Saint-Omer, the same area where Bader out and was captured in 1941.

Bader&#x27;s mother was remarried shortly thereafter to the Reverend Ernest William Hobbs. Bader was subsequently brought up in the rectory of the village of Sprotbrough, near Doncaster, West Riding of Yorkshire. Bader&#x27;s mild-mannered stepfather did not become the father figure he needed. His mother showed little interest in Bader and sent him to his grandparents on occasion. Without guidance, Bader became unruly. During one incident with an air gun, Bader shot a noted local lady through a bathroom window, as she was about to enter a bath. Later, an argument with Derick about the suffering inflicted by a pellet saw him being shot in the shoulder at point-blank range. Bader was then sent as a boarder to Temple Grove School, one of the &quot;Famous Five&quot; of English prep schools—one that gave its boys a Spartan upbringing.

Bader&#x27;s aggressive energy found a new lease of life at St Edward&#x27;s School, where he received his secondary education. During his time there, he thrived at sports; he played rugby and often enjoyed physical battles with bigger and older opponents. The then Warden (or Headmaster), Henry E. Kendall, tolerated Bader&#x27;s aggressive and competitive nature. At one point, he made him a prefect despite what others saw as a strong streak of conceit in the boy. Fellow RAF pilots Guy Gibson and Adrian Warburton also attended the school. In later life, Bader&#x27;s prowess on the rugby pitch was such that he was invited to play a trial (or friendly game) with the Harlequins, but it is not clear whether he actually played.

Bader&#x27;s sporting interests continued into his military service. He was selected for the Royal Air Force cricket team, to play a first-class match against the Army at The Oval in July 1931. He scored 65 and 1. In August, he played in a two-day game against the Royal Navy. He played cricket in a German prisoner-of-war camp after his capture in 1941, despite his later disability.

In mid-1923, Bader, at the age of 13, was introduced to an Avro 504 during a school holiday trip to visit his aunt, Hazel, who was marrying RAF Flight Lieutenant Cyril Burge, adjutant at RAF Cranwell. Although he enjoyed the visit and took an interest in aviation, he showed no signs of becoming a keen pilot. Still very sports minded, an interest which dominated Bader&#x27;s formative years, he took less of an interest in his studies. However, Bader received guidance from Warden Kendall and, with Kendall&#x27;s encouragement, he excelled at his studies and was later accepted as a cadet at RAF Cranwell. Soon afterwards, he was offered a place at Oxford University, but turned it down as he preferred Cambridge University.

His mother refused to allow Bader to attend Cambridge in December 1927, claiming she could not afford the fees. A master at St. Edwards, a Mr Dingwall, helped pay these fees in part. Due to his new connection with Cyril Burge, Bader learned of the six annual prize cadetships offered by RAF Cranwell each year. Out of hundreds of applicants, he finished fifth. He left St Edward&#x27;s in early 1928, aged 18.

===Joining the RAF===
In 1928, Bader joined the RAF as an officer cadet at the Royal Air Force College Cranwell in rural Lincolnshire. He continued to excel at sports, and added hockey and boxing to his repertoire. Motorcycling was tolerated at Cranwell, though cadets usually took part in banned activities such as speeding, pillion racing as well as buying and racing motorcars. Bader was involved in these activities and was close to expulsion after being caught out too often, in addition to coming in 19th out of 21 in his class examinations; however, his commanding officer (CO), Air vice-marshal Frederick Halahan gave him a private warning about his conduct.

On 13 September 1928, Bader took his first flight with his instructor, Flying Officer W. J. &quot;Pissy&quot; Pearson, in an Avro 504. He made his first solo flight on 19 February 1929 after 11 hours and 15 minutes of flight time.

Bader competed for the &quot;Sword of Honour&quot; award at the end of his two-year course, but lost to Patrick Coote, his nearest rival. Coote went on to become the Wing Commander of Western Wing, British Air Forces Greece, and was killed on 13 April 1941 while flying as an observer in a No. 211 Squadron Bristol Blenheim, &quot;L4819&quot;, flown by Flying Officer R. V. Herbert when six of the squadron&#x27;s aircraft were shot down over Greece. Coote&#x27;s aircraft was the first of 29 aerial victories for the Luftwaffe ace &quot;Unteroffizier&quot;, (later &quot;Leutnant&quot;) Fritz Gromotka.

On 26 July 1930, Bader was commissioned as a pilot officer into No. 23 Squadron RAF based at Kenley, Surrey. Flying Gloster Gamecocks and soon afterwards Bristol Bulldogs, Bader became a daredevil while training there, often flying illegal and dangerous stunts. While very fast for its time, the Bulldog had directional stability problems at low speeds, which made such stunts exceptionally dangerous. Strict orders were issued forbidding unauthorised aerobatics below . Bader took this as an unnecessary safety rule rather than an order to be obeyed.

After one training flight at the gunnery range, Bader achieved only a 38 percent hit rate on a target. Receiving jibes from members of a rival squadron (No. 25 Squadron RAF), Bader took off to perform aerobatics and show off his skill. It was against regulations, and seven out of 23 accidents caused by ignoring regulations had proven fatal. The CO of No. 25 Squadron remarked that he would order Bader to face a court-martial if Bader was in his unit. The COs of Bader&#x27;s unit, Harry Day and Henry Wollett, gave the pilots more latitude, although Day encouraged them to recognise their own limits.

No. 23 Squadron had won the Hendon Air Show &quot;pairs&quot; event in 1929 and 1930. In 1931 Bader, teamed with Harry Day, successfully defended the squadron&#x27;s title in the spring that year. In late 1931, Bader undertook training for the 1932 Hendon Air Show, hoping to win a second consecutive title. Two pilots had been killed attempting aerobatics. The pilots were warned not to practise these manoeuvres under and to keep above at all times.

Nevertheless, on 14 December 1931, while visiting Reading Aero Club, Bader attempted some low-flying aerobatics at Woodley Airfield in a Bulldog Mk. IIA, &quot;K1676&quot;, of 23 Squadron, apparently on a dare. His aircraft crashed when the tip of the left wing touched the ground. Bader was rushed to the Royal Berkshire Hospital, where, in the hands of the prominent surgeon J. Leonard Joyce (1882–1939), parts of both his legs were amputated—one above and one below the knee. Bader made the following laconic entry in his logbook after the crash:

In 1932, after a long convalescence, throughout which he needed morphine for pain relief, Bader was transferred to the hospital at RAF Uxbridge and fought hard to regain his former abilities after he was given a new pair of artificial legs. In time, his agonising and determined efforts paid off, and he was able to drive a specially modified car, play golf, and even dance. During his convalescence there, he met and fell in love with Thelma Edwards, a waitress at a tea room called the Pantiles on the A30 London Road in Bagshot, Surrey.

Bader got his chance to prove that he could still fly when, in June 1932, Air Under-Secretary Philip Sassoon arranged for him to take up an Avro 504, which he piloted competently. A subsequent medical examination proved him fit for active service, but in April 1933 he was notified that the RAF had decided to reverse the decision on the grounds that this situation was not covered by King&#x27;s Regulations. In May, Bader was invalided out of the RAF, took an office job with the Asiatic Petroleum Company (now Shell) and, on 5 October 1933, married Thelma Edwards.

==Second World War==

===Return to RAF===
Against a background of increasing tensions in Europe in 1937–39, Bader repeatedly requested that the Air Ministry accept him back into the RAF and he was finally invited to a selection board meeting at Adastral House in London&#x27;s Kingsway. Bader was disappointed to learn that it was only &quot;ground jobs&quot; that were being offered. It appeared that he would be refused a flying position but Air Vice-Marshal Halahan, commandant of RAF Cranwell in Bader&#x27;s days there, personally endorsed him and asked the Central Flying School, Upavon, to assess his capabilities.

On 14 October 1939, the Central Flying School requested Bader report for flight tests on 18 October. He did not wait; driving down the next morning, Bader undertook refresher courses. Despite reluctance on the part of the establishment to allow him to apply for an A.1.B. (full flying category status), his persistent efforts paid off. Bader regained a medical categorisation for operational flying at the end of November 1939 and was posted to the Central Flying School for a refresher course on modern types of aircraft.

On 27 November, eight years after his accident, Bader flew solo again in an Avro Tutor; once airborne, he could not resist the temptation to turn the biplane upside down at inside the circuit area. Bader subsequently progressed through the Fairey Battle and Miles Master (the last training stage before flying Spitfires and Hurricanes).

===Phoney War===

In January 1940, Bader was posted to No. 19 Squadron based at RAF Duxford near Cambridge, where, at 29, he was older than most of his fellow pilots. Squadron Leader Geoffrey Stephenson, a close friend from his Cranwell days, was the commanding officer, and it was here that Bader got his first glimpse of a Spitfire. It was thought that Bader&#x27;s success as a fighter pilot was partly because of his having no legs; pilots pulling high g-forces in combat turns often blacked out as the flow of blood from the brain drained to the lower parts of the body, especially the legs. As Bader had no legs he could remain conscious longer, and thus had an advantage over opponents with legs.

Between February and May 1940 Bader practised formation flying and air tactics, as well as undertaking patrols over convoys out at sea. Bader found opposition to his ideas about aerial combat. He favoured using the sun and altitude to ambush the enemy, but the RAF did not share his opinions. Official orders/doctrine dictated that pilots should fly line-astern and attack singly. Despite this being at odds with his preferred tactics, Bader obeyed orders, and his skill saw him rapidly promoted to section leader.

During this time, Bader crashed a Spitfire on take-off. He had forgotten to switch the propeller pitch from coarse to fine, resulting in the aircraft careering down the runway at 80 mph before crashing. Despite a head wound, Bader got into another Spitfire for a second attempt. On the way to his room after the flight, he thought he had injured himself as he found it difficult to walk. He soon discovered that his artificial legs had been buckled from having been forced beneath the rudder pedals during the crash. He realised that if he had not lost his legs previously, he would have definitely lost them this time. Bader was subsequently promoted from flying officer to flight lieutenant, and appointed as a flight commander of No. 222 Squadron RAF.

===Battle of France===
Bader had his first taste of combat with No. 222 Squadron RAF, which was based at RAF Duxford and commanded by another old friend of his, Squadron Leader &quot;Tubby&quot; Mermagen. On 10 May the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; invaded Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. The campaigns went badly for the Western Allies and soon they were evacuating from Dunkirk during the battle for the port. RAF squadrons were ordered to provide air supremacy for the Royal Navy during Operation Dynamo.

While patrolling the coast near Dunkirk on 1 June 1940 at around , Bader happened upon a Messerschmitt Bf 109 in front of him, flying in the same direction and at approximately the same speed. He believed that the German must have been a novice, taking no evasive action even though it took more than one burst of gunfire to shoot him down. Bader was also credited with a Messerschmitt Bf 110 damaged, despite claiming five victories in that particular dogfight.

In the next patrol Bader was credited with a Heinkel He 111 damaged. On 4 June 1940, his encounter with a Dornier Do 17, which was attacking Allied shipping, involved a near collision while he was firing at the aircraft&#x27;s rear gunner during a high-speed pass. Shortly after Bader joined 222 Squadron, it moved to RAF Kirton in Lindsey, just south of the Humber.

After flying operations over Dunkirk, on 28 June 1940 Bader was posted to command No. 242 Squadron RAF as acting squadron leader. A Hawker Hurricane squadron based at RAF Coltishall, No. 242 Squadron was mainly made up of Canadians who had suffered high losses in the Battle of France and when Bader arrived were suffering from low morale. Despite initial resistance to their new commanding officer, the pilots (including such aces as Willie McKnight and Stan Turner) were soon won over by Bader&#x27;s strong personality and perseverance, especially in cutting through red tape to make the squadron operational again. Bader transformed No. 242 Squadron back into an effective fighting unit. Bader had three Royal Navy officers in No. 242 Squadron, including his wingman Richard &quot;Dickie&quot; Cork. Upon the formation of No. 12 Group RAF, No. 242 Squadron was assigned to the group while based at RAF Duxford. No. 242 Squadron became fully operational on 9 July 1940.

===Battle of Britain===

After the French campaign, the RAF prepared for the coming Battle of Britain in which the Luftwaffe intended to achieve air supremacy. Once attained, the Germans would attempt to launch Operation Sea Lion, the codename for an invasion of Britain. The battle officially began on 10 July 1940.

On 11 July, Bader scored his first victory with his new squadron. The cloud base was down to just 600 ft while drizzle and mist covered most of the sky, and forward visibility was down to just 2,000 yards. Bader was alone on patrol, and was soon directed toward an enemy aircraft flying north up the Norfolk coast.

Spotting the aircraft at 600 yards, Bader recognised it as a Dornier Do 17, and after he closed to 250 yards its rear gunner opened fire. Bader continued his attack and fired two bursts into the bomber before it vanished into cloud. The Dornier, which crashed into the sea off Cromer, was later confirmed by a member of the Royal Observer Corps. On 21 August, a similar engagement took place. This time, a Dornier went into the sea off Great Yarmouth and again the Observer Corps confirmed the claim. There were no survivors.

Later in the month, Bader scored a further two victories over Messerschmitt Bf 110s. On 30 August 1940, No. 242 Squadron was moved to Duxford again and found itself in the thick of the fighting. On this date, the squadron claimed 10 enemy aircraft, Bader scoring two victories against Bf 110s. Other squadrons were involved, and it was impossible to verify which RAF units were responsible for the damage on the enemy. On 7 September, two more Bf 110s were shot down, but in the same engagement Bader was badly hit by a Messerschmitt Bf 109. Bader almost out, but recovered the Hurricane. Other pilots witnessed one of Bader&#x27;s victims crash.

On 7 September, Bader claimed two Bf 109s shot down, followed by a Junkers Ju 88. On 9 September, Bader claimed another Dornier. During the same mission, he attacked a He 111 only to discover he was out of ammunition. Enraged, he thought about ramming it and slicing off the rudder with his propeller, but turned away when he regained his composure. On 14 September, Bader was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his combat leadership.

On 15 September, known as the Battle of Britain Day, Bader damaged a Do 17 and a Ju 88, while destroying another Do 17 in the afternoon. Bader flew several missions that day, which involved heavy air combat. The original combat report states that he destroyed one enemy aircraft, claimed no probable, but did claim several damaged. The Dornier&#x27;s gunner attempted to bale out, but his parachute was caught on the tail wheel and he died when the aircraft crashed into the Thames Estuary. Further detail suggests Bader took pity on the gunner and &quot;tried to kill him to put him out of his misery&quot;. Another Do 17 and a Ju 88 were claimed on 18 September. A Bf 109 was claimed on 27 September. Bader&#x27;s DSO was gazetted on 1 October 1940. On 24 September, he had been promoted to the war substantive rank of flight lieutenant.

===&quot;Big Wing&quot; tactic===
As a friend and supporter of his 12 Group commander, Air Vice Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory, Bader joined him as an active exponent of the controversial &quot;Big Wing&quot; theory which provoked much debate in the RAF during the battle. Bader was an outspoken critic of the careful &quot;husbanding&quot; tactics being used by Air Vice Marshal Keith Park, the commander of 11 Group. Park was supported by Fighter Command Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding, the overall commander. Bader vociferously campaigned for an aggressive policy of assembling large formations of defensive fighters north of London ready to inflict maximum damage on the massed German bomber formations as they flew over South East England.

As the Battle progressed, Bader often found himself at the head of a composite wing of fighters consisting of up to five squadrons, known as the &quot;Duxford Wing&quot;. Achievements of the Big Wing were hard to quantify, as the large formations often took too long to form up, over claimed victories, and too often did not provide timely support of the over-committed 11 Group. The episode probably contributed to the departure of Park, who was replaced with Leigh-Mallory in November 1940, and Dowding.

While it is not known whether Mallory and Bader were aware that the claims of the RAF and Big Wings were exaggerated, they certainly tried to use them as a potent tool with which to remove Park and Dowding from command and pursue the Big Wing tactic. After the war, Bader insisted that both he and Leigh-Mallory wanted the Big Wing tactic enacted in 12 Group only. They both believed, according to Bader, that it was impractical to use it in 11 Group, as the command was located too close to the enemy and would not have enough time to assemble.

RAF ace Johnnie Johnson offered his own view of Bader and the Big Wing:
During the Battle of Britain, Bader used three Hawker Hurricanes. The first was &quot;P3061&quot;, in which he scored six air victories. The second aircraft was unknown (possibly &quot;P3090&quot;), but Bader did score one victory and two damaged in it on 9 September. The third was &quot;V7467&quot;, in which he destroyed four more and added one probable and two damaged by the end of September. The machine was lost on 1 September 1941 while on a training exercise.

On 12 December 1940, Bader was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for his services during the Battle of Britain. His unit, No. 242 Squadron, had claimed 62 aerial victories. Bader was gazetted on 7 January 1941. By this time, he was an acting squadron leader.

===Wing leader===
On 18 March 1941, Bader was promoted to acting wing commander and became one of the first &quot;wing leaders&quot;. Stationed at Tangmere with 145, 610 and 616 Squadrons under his command, Bader led his wing of Spitfires on sweeps and &quot;Circus&quot; operations (medium bomber escort) over north-western Europe throughout the summer campaign. These were missions combining bombers and fighters designed to lure out and tie down German Luftwaffe fighter units that might otherwise serve on the Russian front. One of the wing leader&#x27;s &quot;perks&quot; was permission to have his initials marked on his aircraft as personal identification, thus &quot;D-B&quot; was painted on the side of Bader&#x27;s Spitfire. These letters gave rise to his radio call-sign &quot;Dogsbody&quot;.

During 1941 his wing was re-equipped with Spitfire VBs, which had two Hispano 20 mm cannon and four .303 machine guns. Bader flew a Mk VA equipped with eight .303 machine guns, as he insisted that these guns were more effective against fighter opposition. His tactics required a close-in approach in which he felt the lower calibre weapons had a more devastating effect. At the time, RAF trials with wing-mounted cannons had also revealed a number of shortcomings that precluded a widespread acceptance of the armament.

Bader&#x27;s combat missions were mainly fought against Bf 109s over France and the Channel. On 7 May 1941 he shot down one Bf 109 and claimed another as a probable victory. The German formation belonged to &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 26 (JG 26Fighter Wing 26), which on that date was led in action by German ace Adolf Galland, and was also when Galland claimed his 68th victory. Bader and Galland met again 94 days later. On 21 June 1941, Bader shot down a Bf 109E off the coast near Desvres. His victory was witnessed by two other pilots who saw a Bf 109 crash and the German pilot out. On 25 June 1941 Bader shot down two more Bf 109Fs. The first was shot down between 11:58 and 13:35 off the coast of Gravelines; the pilot out. In the same action he shared in the destruction of another Bf 109F. The second Bf 109 was shot down in the afternoon.

The following month was more successful for Bader. On 2 July 1941 he was awarded the bar to his DSO. Later that day he claimed one Bf 109 destroyed and another damaged. On 4 July, Bader fired on a Bf 109E which slowed down so much that he nearly collided with it. Squadron Leader Burton saw the entire combat and noted the Bf 109 &quot;fell away in a sloppy fashion&quot;, &quot;as though the pilot had been hit&quot;. It was marked as a probable. On 6 July another Bf 109 was shot down and the pilot out. This victory was witnessed by Pilot Officers Johnnie Johnson and Alan Smith (Bader&#x27;s usual wingman).

On 9 July, Bader claimed one probable and one damaged, both trailing coolant or oil. On 10 July Bader claimed a Bf 109 (and one damaged) over Bethune. Later, Bader destroyed a Bf 109E which blew up south of, or actually over, Calais. On 12 July, Bader found further success, shooting down one Bf 109 and damaging three others between Bethune and St Omer. Bader was again gazetted on 15 July. On 23 July, Bader claimed another Bf 109 damaged and possibly destroyed, even though the action resulted in two Bf 109s destroyed. The other was shot down by Squadron Leader Burton. Bader did not see his Bf 109 crash, so he claimed it as a damaged only, despite the fact pilots of No. 242 Squadron saw two Bf 109s crash.

Bader had been pushing for more sorties to fly in late 1941 but his Wing was tired. He was intent on adding to his score, which, according to the CO of No. 616 Squadron. Billy Burton, brought the other pilots and mood in his wing to a near-mutinous state. Trafford Leigh-Mallory, Bader&#x27;s immediate superior as OC No. 11 Group, Fighter Command, relented and allowed Bader to continue frequent missions over France even though his score of 20 and the accompanying strain evident on his features obliged Leigh-Mallory to consider his withdrawal from operations. Ultimately, Leigh-Mallory did not want to upset his star pilot, and did not invoke any restrictions.

===Last combat===
Between 24 March and 9 August 1941, Bader flew 62 fighter sweeps over France. On 9 August 1941, Bader was flying a Spitfire Mk VA serial &quot;W3185&quot; &quot;D-B&quot; on an offensive patrol over the French coast, looking for Messerschmitt Bf 109s from Abbeville or Wissant without his trusted wingman Alan Smith. Smith, who was described by fellow pilot Johnnie Johnson as &quot;leechlike&quot; and the &quot;perfect number two&quot;, was unable to fly on that day due to a head cold, so was in London being fitted for a new uniform ready for his officer commission. It is possible that this may have been a contributing factor as to how events unfolded.

Just after Bader&#x27;s section of four aircraft crossed the coast, 12 Bf 109s were spotted flying in formation approximately 2,000 to 3,000 feet (600 to 900 metres) below them and travelling in the same direction. Bader dived on them too fast and too steeply to be able to aim and fire his guns, and barely avoided colliding with one of them. He levelled out at to find that he was now alone, separated from his section, and was considering whether to return home when he spotted three pairs of Bf 109s a couple of miles in front of him. He dropped down below them and closed up before destroying one of them with a short burst of fire from close range. Bader was just opening fire on a second Bf 109, which trailed white smoke and dropped down, when he noticed the two on his left turning towards him. At this point he decided it would be better to return home; however, making the mistake of banking away from them, Bader believed he had a mid-air collision with the second of the two Bf 109s on his right that were continuing straight ahead.

Bader&#x27;s fuselage, tail and fin were gone from behind him, and he lost height rapidly at what he estimated to be 400 mph (640 km/h) in a slow spin. He jettisoned the cockpit canopy, released his harness pin, and the air rushing past the open cockpit started to suck him out, but his prosthetic leg was trapped. Part way out of the cockpit and still attached to his aircraft, Bader fell for some time before he released his parachute, at which point the leg&#x27;s retaining strap snapped under the strain and he was pulled free. A Bf 109 flew by some 50 yards away as he neared the ground at around .

====Controversy over cause====
Although Bader believed for years that he had collided in midair with a Bf 109, two other possibilities have later been put forward; that he was shot down by a German Bf 109, or alternatively that he may have been a victim of friendly fire. Recent research shows no Bf 109 was lost to a collision that day, and there is also doubt that a German pilot was responsible for shooting him down. &quot;Feldwebel&quot; Max Meyer of II./JG 26 flying a Bf 109 had claimed him shot down that morning and according to Luftwaffe records a &quot;Leutnant&quot; Wolfgang Kosse of 5./JG 26 and Meyer, of 6./JG 26 were the only German pilots to claim a victory that day. Furthermore, Meyer mentioned that he had followed the downed Spitfire and watched the pilot out, something which seems to match this passage in Bader&#x27;s memoirs:

Bader met Max Meyer in Sydney in 1981 during the Schofields Air Show. None of the German pilots who made a claim for an aerial victory that day could match their report with the demise of Bader&#x27;s Spitfire. Adolf Galland, &quot;Geschwaderkommodore&quot; of JG 26, went through every report, even those of German pilots killed in the action, to determine Bader&#x27;s victor. Each case was dismissed. Kosse&#x27;s claim only matches the victory against No. 452 Squadron RAF&#x27;s Sergeant Haydon.

More recently, in 2003 air historian Andy Saunders wrote a book &quot;Bader&#x27;s Last Flight&quot;, following up with a Channel 4 documentary &quot;Who Downed Douglas Bader?&quot;, which first aired on 28 August 2006. Saunders&#x27; research now suggests that Bader may have been a victim of friendly fire, shot down by one of his fellow RAF pilots after becoming detached from his own squadron. RAF combat records indicate Bader may have been shot down by Flight Lieutenant &quot;Buck&quot; Casson of No. 616 Squadron RAF, who claimed a Bf 109 whose tail came off and the pilot out, before he himself was shot down and captured.

Casson also mentioned that for a while he watched as the pilot struggled to out. Bader was flying at the rear of the German fighter formation, alone, and his squadron were the opposite side of the Germans. &quot;Buck&quot; had only a few seconds in which he saw Bader and mistook his Spitfire for a Bf 109. In a letter to Bader on 28 May 1945, Casson explained the action. While this source made it into the public domain, it was severely edited. The nature of the letter, that it was from Casson to Bader, was removed. Crucially, an entire paragraph, which mentioned specifically the tail coming off &quot;a Bf 109&quot; and the pilot struggling to get out of the cockpit, was completely omitted from the original source, still in the Casson family&#x27;s possession. Saunders stated that this was not absolute proof, and that it would be helpful to find the &quot;Bader Spitfire&quot;.

====Search for W3185====
The quest to find Bader&#x27;s Spitfire, &quot;W3185&quot;, shed light on the demise of another famous wartime ace, Wilhelm Balthasar, &quot;Geschwaderkommodore&quot; of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 2 &quot;Richthofen&quot;, who was killed in action on 3 July 1941 when his Bf 109F crashed into Ferme Goset, Wittes, France. It was recovered in March 2004. Later, in the summer 2004, a further aircraft was discovered in Widdebrouch. It was found to be that of a Bf 109F, flown by &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; Albert Schlager of JG 26, who was reported missing during Bader&#x27;s last combat on 9 August 1941. A brief glimpse of hope was discovered later, when a Spitfire wreck was found. Inside was a flying helmet with the letters &quot;DB&quot; written on the top. It was later identified as a Spitfire IX, owing to the findings of a 20mm cannon (which Bader&#x27;s Spitfire did not have), and ammunition dated as 1943.

Bader&#x27;s aircraft was not found. It is likely that it came down at Mont Dupil Farm near the French village of Blaringhem, possibly near Desprez sawmill. A French witness, Jacques Taffin, saw the Spitfire disintegrating as it came down. He thought it had been hit by anti-aircraft fire, but none was active in the area. There were also no Spitfire remains in the area. The lack of any remains was not surprising, owing to the Spitfire breaking up on its descent. Historians have also been misled as to the whereabouts of the Spitfire because of a mistake in the book &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot;, in which Bader stated his leg had been dug out from the wreckage but was damaged, indicating a definite crash site. Bader&#x27;s leg had actually been found in an open field.

===Prisoner of war===

The Germans treated Bader with great respect. When Bader was taken prisoner, he was sent to a hospital in Saint-Omer, near the place where his father&#x27;s grave is located. On leaving the hospital, Colonel Adolf Galland and his pilots invited him on to their airfield and they received him as a friend. Bader was cordially invited to sit in the cockpit of Galland&#x27;s personal Bf 109. Bader asked Galland if it was possible to test the 109 by &quot;a flight around the airfield&quot;. Galland laughingly refused.

Bader had lost a prosthetic leg when escaping his disabled aircraft. When he had out, Bader&#x27;s right prosthetic leg became trapped in the aircraft, and he escaped only when the leg&#x27;s retaining straps snapped after he pulled the ripcord on his parachute. Galland notified the British of his damaged leg and offered them safe passage to drop off a replacement. Hermann Göring himself gave the green light for the operation. The British responded on 19 August 1941 with the &quot;Leg Operation&quot;—an RAF bomber was allowed to drop a new prosthetic leg by parachute to St Omer, a Luftwaffe base in occupied France, as part of Circus 81 involving six Bristol Blenheims and a sizeable fighter escort including 452 Squadron.

The Germans were less impressed when, task done, the bombers proceeded on to their bombing mission to Gosnay Power Station near Bethune, although bad weather prevented the target being attacked. Galland stated in an interview that the aircraft dropped the leg after bombing Galland&#x27;s airfield. Galland did not meet Bader again until mid-1945, when he, Günther Rall and Hans-Ulrich Rudel arrived at RAF Tangmere as prisoners of war. Bader, according to Rall, personally arranged for Rudel, a fellow amputee, to be fitted with an artificial leg.

Bader escaped from the hospital where he was recovering by tying together sheets. Initially the &quot;rope&quot; did not reach the ground; with the help of another patient, he slid the sheet from under the comatose New Zealand pilot, Bill Russell of No. 485 Squadron, who had had his arm amputated the day before. Russell&#x27;s bed was then moved to the window to act as an anchor. A French maid at the St. Omer hospital attempted to get in touch with British agents to enable Bader to escape to Britain. She later brought a letter from a peasant couple (a Mr. and Mrs. Hiecques), who promised to shelter him outside St. Omer until he could be passed further down the line. Until then, their son would wait outside the hospital every night until there was a chance of escape. Eventually, he escaped out of a window. The plan worked initially. Bader completed the long walk to the safe house despite wearing a British uniform. Unfortunately for him, the plan was betrayed by another woman at the hospital. He hid in the garden when a German staff car arrived at the house, but was found later. Bader denied that the couple had known he was there. They, along with the French woman at the hospital, were sent for forced labour in Germany. The couple survived. After the war, French authorities sentenced the woman informer to 20 years in prison.

Over the next few years, Bader made himself a thorn in the side of the Germans. He often practised what the RAF personnel called &quot;goon-baiting&quot;. He considered it his duty to cause as much trouble to the enemy as possible, much of which included escape attempts. He made so many escape attempts that the Germans threatened to take away his legs.

On 15 February 1942, Bader was a prisoner held at the Warburg POW camp. Using his camp confederate Peter Tunstall&#x27;s split-photo technique, Bader sneaked out a letter. He described conditions in the camp as &#x27;bloody&#x27;, the German rations as poor, and requested that future Red Cross parcels include concentrates of vitamins A, B, C, and D. Bader predicted that the German casualty rate on the Eastern front would &quot;settle Germany in six months&quot;, and ended the letter with &quot;Keep bombing these bastards to Hell.&quot;.

In Warburg, Rademacher liked enforcing harsh searches and long Appells. With regularity, he commanded the ferrets to storm a barrack, and &#x27;bastard search&#x27;. He also delayed Appells in the freezing cold. Lieutenant Hager was under the command of Major Rademacher. A common way for Hager and his cohorts to punish lags on searches or a long Appell was a rifle butt stroke to the face or the frozen foot. On 10 April 1942, Hager abused Bader. He whacked his wooden foot with a rifle butt. Bader laughed it off and insulted his efforts. Bader and Hager were both sent to the cooler as punishment. On 17 April 1942, Bader scolded Hager; he had failed to salute Bader, his superior in rank. The command punished Hager for not respecting rank, and threw him and Bader in the cells once more.

In August 1942, Bader escaped with Johnny Palmer and three others from the camp at Stalag Luft III B in Sagan. Unluckily, a Luftwaffe officer of JG 26 was in the area. Keen to meet the Tangmere wing leader, he dropped by to see Bader, but when he knocked on his door, there was no answer. Soon the alarm was raised, and a few days later, Bader was recaptured. During the escape attempt, the Germans produced a poster of Bader and Palmer asking for information. It described Bader&#x27;s disability and said he &quot;walks well with stick&quot;. Twenty years later, Bader was sent a copy of it by a Belgian civilian prisoner, who had worked in a Gestapo office in Leipzig. Bader found this amusing, as he had never used a stick.

He was finally dispatched to the &quot;escape-proof&quot; Colditz Castle &quot;Oflag IV-C&quot; on 16 August 1942. In May 1944 the Gestapo listed twenty per cent of the medical cases in the castle as &quot;&quot; (anti-German); because of this the Gestapo denied him medical repatriation. The list raised suspicion that the likes of Bader and many others would be the first in the castle to be tortured, or executed, if Hitler or the Gestapo made a justification.

===Liberation===
Bader remained at Colditz until 16 April 1945 when it was liberated by the First United States Army after a two-day fight with the defending Germans. Others had stopped goon-baiting but Bader continued to the end, which saved his life as an American shell destroyed his room. Lee Carson, an American journalist accompanying the army, went out of her way to find Bader and gain a personal account of the conditions within the castle. Bader departed the castle with Carson; he was in Paris the next day, and in Britain on the following day, returning home far earlier than other prisoners.

==Postwar==
===Last years in the RAF===
After his return to Britain, Bader was given the honour of leading a victory flypast of 300 aircraft over London in June 1945. On 1 July, he was promoted to temporary wing commander. Soon after, Bader was looking for a post in the RAF. Air Marshal Richard Atcherley, a former Schneider Trophy pilot, was commanding the Central Fighter Establishment at Tangmere. He and Bader had been junior officers at Kenley in 1930, while serving in No. 23 Squadron RAF. Bader was given the post of the Fighter Leader&#x27;s School commanding officer. He received a promotion to war substantive wing commander on 1 December and soon after was promoted to temporary group captain.

Unfortunately for Bader, the fighter aircraft&#x27;s roles had now expanded significantly and he spent most of his time instructing on ground attack and co-operation with ground forces. Also, Bader did not get on with the newer generation of squadron leaders who considered him to be &quot;out of date&quot;. In the end, Air Marshal James Robb offered Bader a role commanding the North Weald sector of No. 11 Group RAF, an organisation steeped in Fighter Command and Battle of Britain history. It is likely Bader would have stayed in the RAF for some time had his mentor Leigh-Mallory not been killed in an air crash in November 1944, such was the respect and influence he held over Bader. However, Bader&#x27;s enthusiasm for continued service in the RAF had waned.

On 21 July 1946, Bader retired from the RAF with the rank of group captain to take a job at Royal Dutch Shell.

===Postwar career===
Bader considered politics, and standing as a Member of Parliament (MP) for his home constituency in the House of Commons. He despised how the three main political parties used war veterans for their own political ends. Instead, he resolved to join Shell. His decision was not motivated by money, but a willingness to repay a debt. Shell had been ready to take him on, aged 23, after his accident. Other companies had offered him more money, but he chose to join Shell on principle.

There was another incentive. Joining Shell would allow him to continue flying. He would travel as an executive, and it meant he could fly a light aircraft. He spent most of his time abroad flying around in a company-owned Percival Proctor and later a Miles Gemini. On one mission, between 15 August and 16 September 1946, Bader was sent on a public relations mission for Shell around Europe and North Africa with United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Lieutenant General James Doolittle, Doolittle having left active duty in January 1946 and returned to the Reserves.

Bader became managing director of Shell Aircraft until he retired in 1969. In that year he also served as a technical advisor to the film &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;. Bader travelled to every major country outside the Communist world, becoming internationally famous and a popular after-dinner speaker on aviation matters. In 1975 he spoke at the funeral of Air Chief Marshal Keith Park.

===Personality===
When the film &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; was released, people associated Bader with the quiet and amiable personality of actor Kenneth More, who played Bader. Bader recognised that the producers had deleted all those habits he displayed when on operations, particularly his prolific use of bad language. Bader once said, &quot;[they] still think [I&#x27;m] the dashing chap Kenneth More was&quot;. Bader&#x27;s more controversial traits were touched upon by Brickhill in the book &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot;. &quot;He is a somewhat &#x27;difficult&#x27; person&quot;, Brickhill told (Sir) Billy Collins, head of his publishing house William Collins and Sons, after spending over a year talking to him. Nevertheless, Bader was received as a legendary figure by the wider public, who closely identified him as a leader of &quot;The Few&quot; in the Battle of Britain.

Pete Tunstall, on first meeting Bader, recalled the force of his personality. Tunstall stated about Bader, &quot;On first meeting Douglas Bader, one was forcibly struck by the power of his personality. Woe betide any young cock who thought he might share the roost.&quot; To Tunstall, Bader was not a normal specimen and it slightly unsettled him that people indignantly questioned his overbearing personality and then applied normal standards on to a man who had lost both his legs and yet came back to fly in the cockpit of wartime aircraft.

Never a person to hide his opinions, Bader also became controversial for his political viewpoints. A staunch conservative, his trenchantly expressed views on such subjects as juvenile delinquency, capital punishment, apartheid (which he was in favour of) and Rhodesia&#x27;s defiance of the Commonwealth (he was a strong supporter of Ian Smith&#x27;s white minority regime) attracted much criticism. During the Suez Crisis, Bader travelled to New Zealand. Some of the more recent African countries to join the Commonwealth had been critical of the decision to intervene in Egypt; he replied that they could &quot;bloody well climb back up their trees&quot;.

During a trip to South Africa in November 1965, Bader said that if he had been in Rhodesia when it made its declaration of independence, he &quot;would have had serious thoughts about changing my citizenship.&quot; Later, Bader also wrote the foreword to Hans-Ulrich Rudel&#x27;s biography &quot;Stuka Pilot&quot;. Even when it emerged that Rudel was a fervent supporter of the Nazi Party, Bader said that prior knowledge would not have changed his mind about his contribution.

In the late 1960s, Bader was interviewed on television, where his comments provoked controversy. During the interview, he expressed a desire to be Prime Minister, and listed some controversial proposals should the opportunity ever arise:
* Withdraw sanctions from Rhodesia so negotiations could take place without pressure.
* Stop immigration into Britain immediately until the &quot;situation had been examined&quot;.
* Reintroduce the death penalty for murder.
* Ban betting shops, &quot;They breed protection rackets. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re getting like Chicago in the &#x27;20s&quot;.

Bader was known, at times, to be head-strong, blunt and unsophisticated when he made his opinion known. During one visit to Munich, as a guest of Adolf Galland, he walked into a room full of ex-Luftwaffe pilots and said, &quot;My God, I had no idea we left so many of you bastards alive&quot;. He also used the phrase to describe the Trades Union Congress during economic and social unrest in the 1970s. Later, he suggested that Britons in support of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament were a &quot;rabble&quot; and should be deported.

===Personal life===
Bader&#x27;s first wife, Thelma, developed throat cancer in 1967. Aware that her survival was unlikely, the two spent as much time with each other as possible. Thelma was a smoker, and although she stopped smoking, it did not save her. After a long illness, Thelma died on 24 January 1971, aged 64.

On 3 January 1973, Bader married Joan Murray (née Hipkiss); the couple were to spend the rest of their lives in the village of Marlston, Berkshire. Joan was the daughter of a steel tycoon. She had an interest in riding and was a member of the British Limbless Ex-Servicemen&#x27;s Association. They first met at one of the association&#x27;s events in 1960. She also helped associations involved in riding for disabled people.

Bader campaigned vigorously for people with disabilities and set an example of how one could thrive with a disability. In June 1976, Bader was knighted for his services to disabled people. Actor John Mills and Air Vice-Marshal Neil Cameron were also knighted at the ceremony.

Other awards followed. Bader maintained his interest in aviation, and in 1977 he was made a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. He also received a Doctorate of Science from Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. Bader was also busy acting as a consultant to Aircraft Equipment International at Ascot, Berkshire. Bader&#x27;s health was in decline in the 1970s, and he soon gave up flying altogether. On 4 June 1979, Bader flew his Beech 95 Travelair for the last time, the aircraft having been gifted to him on his retirement from Shell. He had recorded 5,744 hours and 25 minutes flying time. Bader&#x27;s friend Adolf Galland followed Bader into retirement soon afterwards for the same reasons.

His workload was exhausting for a legless man with a worsening heart condition. On 5 September 1982, after a dinner honouring Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Arthur &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris at the Guildhall, at which he spoke, Bader died of a heart attack while being driven through Chiswick, west London, on his way home.

Among the many dignitaries and personalities at his funeral was Adolf Galland. Galland and Bader had shared a friendship that spanned more than 40 years since their first meeting in France. Although Galland was on a business trip to California, he made sure to attend the memorial service held for Bader at the St Clement Danes Church in the Strand. Peter Tory wrote in his &quot;London Diary&quot; newspaper column:

===Tributes===
A biography of Bader by Paul Brickhill, &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot;, was published in 1954. Some 172,000 copies were sold in the first few months alone. The initial print run of 300,000 quickly sold out, as the biography became the biggest-selling hardback in postwar Britain. Brickhill had originally offered Bader fifty per cent of all proceeds, sealing the arrangement with a handshake.

As sales soared, Bader became concerned that, after tax, he would make very little, and he insisted on a new deal, in writing. So, Brickhill agreed to make him a one-off payment from his company Brickhill Publications Limited of £13,125, the majority of which would be for &#x27;expenses&#x27;, and tax-free, with only a small portion for &#x27;services&#x27; and therefore taxable (£ today). The Inland Revenue subsequently waived any tax liabilities on Bader&#x27;s earnings.

After film director Daniel M. Angel bought the film rights and teamed up with Lewis Gilbert to write the screenplay, Bader came to regret the limiting new deal he had wrung from Brickhill. He was so bitter, he refused to attend the premiere, and only saw the film eleven years later, on television. He never spoke to Brickhill again, and never answered his letters. The feature film of the same title was released in 1956, starring Kenneth More as Bader, topping the box office in Britain that year.

On the 60th anniversary of Bader&#x27;s last combat sortie, his widow Joan unveiled a statue at Goodwood, formerly RAF Westhampnett, the aerodrome from which he took off. The 6 ft (1.8 m) bronze sculpture, the first such tribute, was created by Kenneth Potts and was commissioned by the Earl of March, who runs the Goodwood estate.

The Douglas Bader Foundation was formed in honour of Bader in 1982 by family and friends—many also former RAF pilots who had flown with Bader during the Second World War. One of Bader&#x27;s artificial legs is kept by the RAF Museum at their warehouse in Stafford, and is not on public display.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1982 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews during a reception on the Martini Terrace of New Zealand House in London&#x27;s Haymarket.

The Northbrook College Sussex campus at Shoreham Airport has a building named after him in which aeronautical and automotive engineering are taught. The building was opened by his wife Joan Murray.

The Bader Way, in Woodley, Reading is named after Bader. Woodley Airfield, now redeveloped but housing the Museum of Berkshire Aviation, is where Bader lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931.

The Bader Road, in Poole, Dorset is named after Bader.

Bader Walk (previously Douglas Bader Walk but renamed following public consternation) in Birmingham.

Amongst other aircraft-related street names in Apley, Telford, Shropshire, is a Bader Close.

A pub at Martlesham Heath, Suffolk, is named after Bader.

RAF Coltishall, sold off by the MoD, was purchased privately in 2006 and later renamed Badersfield.

Heyford Park Free School Upper Heyford which is located on the former RAF Station Upper Heyford US Air Force airfield has honoured Bader by using his name for one of the school&#x27;s houses. The tie stripe representing Bader is blue. The other houses are red and yellow. Those houses are named after McGuire and Lindh, two US Air Force pilots who sacrificed themselves when their planes crashed in a nearby village in 1992.

Bader Drive near Auckland International Airport in Auckland, New Zealand was named in Bader&#x27;s honour. Bader Intermediate School (Year 7 and 8) near Bader Drive in Mangere, Auckland, New Zealand.

Film production company Bader Media Entertainment CIC is named after Bader; its logo depicts a pipe and feather.

The Douglas Bader Rehabilitation Unit at Queen Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Roehampton, London, a world-renowned limb fitting and amputee rehabilitation centre, is named after him. It was opened by Diana, Princess of Wales in 1993.

In 2020 a special school, named the Bader Academy, was opened in the City of Doncaster. The Academy logo features a plane along with the strapline &quot;where dreams take flight&quot;.

The Royal Air Force Air Cadets &quot;RAFAC Bader&quot; is the organisations main management system, used by both Staff and Cadets.

* &quot;If you came out of the sun, the enemy could not see you.&quot;
* &quot;If you held your fire until you were very close, you seldom missed.&quot;

<text>In molecular biology, RNA polymerase (abbreviated RNAP or RNApol), or more specifically DNA-directed/dependent RNA polymerase (DdRP), is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reactions that synthesize RNA from a DNA template.

Using the enzyme helicase, RNAP locally opens the double-stranded DNA so that one strand of the exposed nucleotides can be used as a template for the synthesis of RNA, a process called transcription. A transcription factor and its associated transcription mediator complex must be attached to a DNA binding site called a promoter region before RNAP can initiate the DNA unwinding at that position. RNAP not only initiates RNA transcription, it also guides the nucleotides into position, facilitates attachment and elongation, has intrinsic proofreading and replacement capabilities, and termination recognition capability. In eukaryotes, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides.

RNAP produces RNA that, functionally, is either for protein coding, i.e. messenger RNA (mRNA); or non-coding (so-called &quot;RNA genes&quot;). Examples of four functional types of RNA genes are:
; Transfer RNA (tRNA): Transfers specific amino acids to growing polypeptide chains at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation;
; Ribosomal RNA (rRNA): Incorporates into ribosomes;
; Micro RNA (miRNA): Regulates gene activity; and, RNA silencing
; Catalytic RNA (ribozyme): Functions as an enzymatically active RNA molecule.

RNA polymerase is essential to life, and is found in all living organisms and many viruses. Depending on the organism, a RNA polymerase can be a protein complex (multi-subunit RNAP) or only consist of one subunit (single-subunit RNAP, ssRNAP), each representing an independent lineage. The former is found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes alike, sharing a similar core structure and mechanism. The latter is found in phages as well as eukaryotic chloroplasts and mitochondria, and is related to modern DNA polymerases. Eukaryotic and archaeal RNAPs have more subunits than bacterial ones do, and are controlled differently.

Bacteria and archaea only have one RNA polymerase. Eukaryotes have multiple types of nuclear RNAP, each responsible for synthesis of a distinct subset of RNA:
==Structure==
The 2006 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Roger D. Kornberg for creating detailed molecular images of RNA polymerase during various stages of the transcription process.

In most prokaryotes, a single RNA polymerase species transcribes all types of RNA. RNA polymerase &quot;core&quot; from E. coli consists of five subunits: two alpha (α) subunits of 36 kDa, a beta (β) subunit of 150 kDa, a beta prime subunit (β′) of 155 kDa, and a small omega (ω) subunit. A sigma (σ) factor binds to the core, forming the holoenzyme. After transcription starts, the factor can unbind and let the core enzyme proceed with its work. The core RNA polymerase complex forms a &quot;crab claw&quot; or &quot;clamp-jaw&quot; structure with an internal channel running along the full length. Eukaryotic and archaeal RNA polymerases have a similar core structure and work in a similar manner, although they have many extra subunits.

All RNAPs contain metal cofactors, in particular zinc and magnesium cations which aid in the transcription process.

==Function==
Control of the process of gene transcription affects patterns of gene expression and, thereby, allows a cell to adapt to a changing environment, perform specialized roles within an organism, and maintain basic metabolic processes necessary for survival. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that the activity of RNAP is long, complex, and highly regulated. In &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; bacteria, more than 100 transcription factors have been identified, which modify the activity of RNAP.

RNAP can initiate transcription at specific DNA sequences known as promoters. It then produces an RNA chain, which is complementary to the template DNA strand. The process of adding nucleotides to the RNA strand is known as elongation; in eukaryotes, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides (the full length of the dystrophin gene). RNAP will preferentially release its RNA transcript at specific DNA sequences encoded at the end of genes, which are known as terminators.

Products of RNAP include:
* Messenger RNA (mRNA)—template for the synthesis of proteins by ribosomes.
* Non-coding RNA or &quot;RNA genes&quot;—a broad class of genes that encode RNA that is not translated into protein. The most prominent examples of RNA genes are transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), both of which are involved in the process of translation. However, since the late 1990s, many new RNA genes have been found, and thus RNA genes may play a much more significant role than previously thought.
** Transfer RNA (tRNA)—transfers specific amino acids to growing polypeptide chains at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation
** Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)—a component of ribosomes
** Micro RNA—regulates gene activity
** Catalytic RNA (Ribozyme)—enzymatically active RNA molecules

RNAP accomplishes &quot;de novo&quot; synthesis. It is able to do this because specific interactions with the initiating nucleotide hold RNAP rigidly in place, facilitating chemical attack on the incoming nucleotide. Such specific interactions explain why RNAP prefers to start transcripts with ATP (followed by GTP, UTP, and then CTP). In contrast to DNA polymerase, RNAP includes helicase activity, therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind DNA.

==Action==
===Initiation===
RNA polymerase binding in bacteria involves the sigma factor recognizing the core promoter region containing the −35 and −10 elements (located &quot;before&quot; the beginning of sequence to be transcribed) and also, at some promoters, the α subunit C-terminal domain recognizing promoter upstream elements. There are multiple interchangeable sigma factors, each of which recognizes a distinct set of promoters. For example, in &quot;E. coli&quot;, σ70 is expressed under normal conditions and recognizes promoters for genes required under normal conditions (&quot;housekeeping genes&quot;), while σ32 recognizes promoters for genes required at high temperatures (&quot;heat-shock genes&quot;). In archaea and eukaryotes, the functions of the bacterial general transcription factor sigma are performed by multiple general transcription factors that work together. The RNA polymerase-promoter closed complex is usually referred to as the &quot;transcription preinitiation complex.&quot;

After binding to the DNA, the RNA polymerase switches from a closed complex to an open complex. This change involves the separation of the DNA strands to form an unwound section of DNA of approximately 13 bp, referred to as the &quot;transcription bubble&quot;. Supercoiling plays an important part in polymerase activity because of the unwinding and rewinding of DNA. Because regions of DNA in front of RNAP are unwound, there are compensatory positive supercoils. Regions behind RNAP are rewound and negative supercoils are present.

===Promoter escape===
RNA polymerase then starts to synthesize the initial DNA-RNA heteroduplex, with ribonucleotides base-paired to the template DNA strand according to Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions. As noted above, RNA polymerase makes contacts with the promoter region. However these stabilizing contacts inhibit the enzyme&#x27;s ability to access DNA further downstream and thus the synthesis of the full-length product. In order to continue RNA synthesis, RNA polymerase must escape the promoter. It must maintain promoter contacts while unwinding more downstream DNA for synthesis, &quot;scrunching&quot; more downstream DNA into the initiation complex. During the promoter escape transition, RNA polymerase is considered a &quot;stressed intermediate.&quot; Thermodynamically the stress accumulates from the DNA-unwinding and DNA-compaction activities. Once the DNA-RNA heteroduplex is long enough (~10 bp), RNA polymerase releases its upstream contacts and effectively achieves the promoter escape transition into the elongation phase. The heteroduplex at the active center stabilizes the elongation complex.

However, promoter escape is not the only outcome. RNA polymerase can also relieve the stress by releasing its downstream contacts, arresting transcription. The paused transcribing complex has two options: (1) release the nascent transcript and begin anew at the promoter or (2) reestablish a new 3′-OH on the nascent transcript at the active site via RNA polymerase&#x27;s catalytic activity and recommence DNA scrunching to achieve promoter escape. Abortive initiation, the unproductive cycling of RNA polymerase before the promoter escape transition, results in short RNA fragments of around 9 bp in a process known as abortive transcription. The extent of abortive initiation depends on the presence of transcription factors and the strength of the promoter contacts.

===Elongation===

The 17-bp transcriptional complex has an 8-bp DNA-RNA hybrid, that is, 8 base-pairs involve the RNA transcript bound to the DNA template strand. As transcription progresses, ribonucleotides are added to the 3′ end of the RNA transcript and the RNAP complex moves along the DNA. The characteristic elongation rates in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are about 10–100 nts/sec.

Aspartyl (asp) residues in the RNAP will hold on to Mg2+ ions, which will, in turn, coordinate the phosphates of the ribonucleotides. The first Mg2+ will hold on to the α-phosphate of the NTP to be added. This allows the nucleophilic attack of the 3′-OH from the RNA transcript, adding another NTP to the chain. The second Mg2+ will hold on to the pyrophosphate of the NTP. The overall reaction equation is:

:(NMP)n + NTP → (NMP)n+1 + PPi

====Fidelity====
Unlike the proofreading mechanisms of DNA polymerase those of RNAP have only recently been investigated. Proofreading begins with separation of the mis-incorporated nucleotide from the DNA template. This pauses transcription. The polymerase then backtracks by one position and cleaves the dinucleotide that contains the mismatched nucleotide. In the RNA polymerase this occurs at the same active site used for polymerization and is therefore markedly different from the DNA polymerase where proofreading occurs at a distinct nuclease active site.

The overall error rate is around 10−4 to 10−6.

===Termination===

In bacteria, termination of RNA transcription can be rho-dependent or rho-independent. The former relies on the rho factor, which destabilizes the DNA-RNA heteroduplex and causes RNA release. The latter, also known as intrinsic termination, relies on a palindromic region of DNA. Transcribing the region causes the formation of a &quot;hairpin&quot; structure from the RNA transcription looping and binding upon itself. This hairpin structure is often rich in G-C base-pairs, making it more stable than the DNA-RNA hybrid itself. As a result, the 8 bp DNA-RNA hybrid in the transcription complex shifts to a 4 bp hybrid. These last 4 base pairs are weak A-U base pairs, and the entire RNA transcript will fall off the DNA.

Transcription termination in eukaryotes is less well understood than in bacteria, but involves cleavage of the new transcript followed by template-independent addition of adenines at its new 3′ end, in a process called polyadenylation.

==Other organisms==
Given that DNA and RNA polymerases both carry out template-dependent nucleotide polymerization, it might be expected that the two types of enzymes would be structurally related. However, x-ray crystallographic studies of both types of enzymes reveal that, other than containing a critical Mg2+ ion at the catalytic site, they are virtually unrelated to each other; indeed template-dependent nucleotide polymerizing enzymes seem to have arisen independently twice during the early evolution of cells. One lineage led to the modern DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases, as well as to a few single-subunit RNA polymerases (ssRNAP) from phages and organelles. The other multi-subunit RNAP lineage formed all of the modern cellular RNA polymerases.

===Bacteria===
In bacteria, the same enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of mRNA and non-coding RNA (ncRNA).

RNAP is a large molecule. The core enzyme has five subunits (~400 kDa):
; β′: The β′ subunit is the largest subunit, and is encoded by the rpoC gene. The β′ subunit contains part of the active center responsible for RNA synthesis and contains some of the determinants for non-sequence-specific interactions with DNA and nascent RNA. It is split into two subunits in Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts.
; β: The β subunit is the second-largest subunit, and is encoded by the rpoB gene. The β subunit contains the rest of the active center responsible for RNA synthesis and contains the rest of the determinants for non-sequence-specific interactions with DNA and nascent RNA.
; α (αI and αII): Two copies of the α subunit, being the third-largest subunit, are present in a molecule of RNAP: αI and αII (one and two). Each α subunit contains two domains: αNTD (N-terminal domain) and αCTD (C-terminal domain). αNTD contains determinants for assembly of RNAP. αCTD (C-terminal domain) contains determinants for interaction with promoter DNA, making non-sequence-non-specific interactions at most promoters and sequence-specific interactions at upstream-element-containing promoters, and contains determinants for interactions with regulatory factors.
; ω: The ω subunit is the smallest subunit. The ω subunit facilitates assembly of RNAP and stabilizes assembled RNAP.

In order to bind promoters, RNAP core associates with the transcription initiation factor sigma (σ) to form RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Sigma reduces the affinity of RNAP for nonspecific DNA while increasing specificity for promoters, allowing transcription to initiate at correct sites. The complete holoenzyme therefore has 6 subunits: β′βαI and αIIωσ (~450 kDa).

===Eukaryotes===

Eukaryotes have multiple types of nuclear RNAP, each responsible for synthesis of a distinct subset of RNA. All are structurally and mechanistically related to each other and to bacterial RNAP:
Eukaryotic chloroplasts contain a multi-subunit RNAP (&quot;PEP, plastid-encoded polymerase&quot;). Due to its bacterial origin, the organization of PEP resembles that of current bacterial RNA polymerases: It is encoded by the RPOA, RPOB, RPOC1 and RPOC2 genes on the plastome, which as proteins form the core subunits of PEP, respectively named α, β, β′ and β″. Similar to the RNA polymerase in &quot;E. coli&quot;, PEP requires the presence of sigma (σ) factors for the recognition of its promoters, containing the -10 and -35 motifs. Despite the many commonalities between plant organellar and bacterial RNA polymerases and their structure, PEP additionally requires the association of a number of nuclear encoded proteins, termed PAPs (PEP-associated proteins), which form essential components that are closely associated with the PEP complex in plants. Initially, a group consisting of 10 PAPs was identified through biochemical methods, which was later extended to 12 PAPs.

Chloroplast also contain a second, structurally and mechanistically unrelated, single-subunit RNAP (&quot;nucleus-encoded polymerase, NEP&quot;). Eukaryotic mitochondria use POLRMT (human), a nucleus-encoded single-subunit RNAP. Such phage-like polymerases are referred to as RpoT in plants.

===Archaea===
Archaea have a single type of RNAP, responsible for the synthesis of all RNA. Archaeal RNAP is structurally and mechanistically similar to bacterial RNAP and eukaryotic nuclear RNAP I-V, and is especially closely structurally and mechanistically related to eukaryotic nuclear RNAP II.
The history of the discovery of the archaeal RNA polymerase is quite recent. The first analysis of the RNAP of an archaeon was performed in 1971, when the RNAP from the extreme halophile &quot;Halobacterium cutirubrum&quot; was isolated and purified. Crystal structures of RNAPs from &quot;Sulfolobus solfataricus&quot; and &quot;Sulfolobus shibatae&quot; set the total number of identified archaeal subunits at thirteen.

Archaea has the subunit corresponding to Eukaryotic Rpb1 split into two. There is no homolog to eukaryotic Rpb9 (POLR2I) in the &quot;S. shibatae&quot; complex, although TFS (TFIIS homolog) has been proposed as one based on similarity. There is an additional subunit dubbed Rpo13; together with Rpo5 it occupies a space filled by an insertion found in bacterial β′ subunits (1,377–1,420 in &quot;Taq&quot;). An earlier, lower-resolution study on &quot;S. solfataricus&quot; structure did not find Rpo13 and only assigned the space to Rpo5/Rpb5. Rpo3 is notable in that it&#x27;s an iron–sulfur protein. RNAP I/III subunit AC40 found in some eukaryotes share similar sequences, but does not bind iron. This domain, in either case, serves a structural function.

Archaeal RNAP subunit previously used an &quot;RpoX&quot; nomenclature where each subunit is assigned a letter in a way unrelated to any other systems. In 2009, a new nomenclature based on Eukaryotic Pol II subunit &quot;Rpb&quot; numbering was proposed.

===Viruses===
Orthopoxviruses and some other nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses synthesize RNA using a virally encoded multi-subunit RNAP. They are most similar to eukaryotic RNAPs, with some subunits minified or removed. Exactly which RNAP they are most similar to is a topic of debate. Most other viruses that synthesize RNA use unrelated mechanics.

Many viruses use a single-subunit DNA-dependent RNAP (ssRNAP) that is structurally and mechanistically related to the single-subunit RNAP of eukaryotic chloroplasts (RpoT) and mitochondria (POLRMT) and, more distantly, to DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases. Perhaps the most widely studied such single-subunit RNAP is bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. ssRNAPs cannot proofread.

B. subtilis prophage SPβ uses YonO, a homolog of the β+β′ subunits of msRNAPs to form a monomeric (both barrels on the same chain) RNAP distinct from the usual &quot;right hand&quot; ssRNAP. It probably diverged very long ago from the canonical five-unit msRNAP, before the time of the last universal common ancestor.

Other viruses use an RNA-dependent RNAP (an RNAP that employs RNA as a template instead of DNA). This occurs in negative strand RNA viruses and dsRNA viruses, both of which exist for a portion of their life cycle as double-stranded RNA. However, some positive strand RNA viruses, such as poliovirus, also contain RNA-dependent RNAP.

==History==
RNAP was discovered independently by Charles Loe, Audrey Stevens, and Jerard Hurwitz in 1960. By this time, one half of the 1959 Nobel Prize in Medicine had been awarded to Severo Ochoa for the discovery of what was believed to be RNAP, but instead turned out to be polynucleotide phosphorylase.

==Purification==

<text>The brahminy kite (Haliastur indus), also known as the red-backed sea-eagle in Australia, is a medium-sized bird of prey in the family Accipitridae, which also includes many other diurnal raptors, such as eagles, buzzards, and harriers, all found in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Australia. The brahminy kite is found mainly on the coast and in inland wetlands, where it feeds on dead fish and other prey. Adults have a reddish-brown body plumage contrasting with their white head and breast which make them easy to distinguish from other birds of prey.

==Taxonomy==

In 1760, French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson described and illustrated the Brahminy kite in the first volume of his &quot;Oiseaux&quot; based on a specimen collected in Pondicherry, India. He used the French name &quot;L&#x27;aigle de Pondichery&quot;. The brahminy kite was included by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot;. It was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither Brisson nor Buffon included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Falco indus&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The brahminy kite is now placed with the whistling kite in the genus &quot;Haliastur&quot; that was erected by the English naturalist Prideaux John Selby in 1840.

Four subspecies are recognized:
==Description==

The brahminy kite is distinctive and contrastingly coloured, with chestnut plumage except for the white head and breast and black wing tips. The juveniles are browner, but can be distinguished from both the resident and migratory races of black kites in Asia by the paler appearance, shorter wings, and rounded tail. The pale patch on the underwing carpal region is of a squarish shape and separated from &quot;Buteo&quot; buzzards.
The brahminy kite is about the same size as the black kite (&quot;Milvus migrans&quot;) and has a typical kite flight, with wings angled, but its tail is rounded unlike the &quot;Milvus&quot; species, red kite, and black kite, which have forked tails. The two genera are, however, very close.

The call is a mewing &quot;keeyew&quot;.

==Distribution and status==

This kite is a familiar sight in the skies of Sri Lanka, Nepal, India, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and southeast Asia and as far south as New South Wales, Australia, through which region it is widespread and resident. They perform seasonal movements associated with rainfall in some parts of their range.

They are mainly seen in the plains, but can sometimes occur above 5000 feet in the Himalayas.

It is evaluated as being of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, the species is on the decline in some parts such as Java.

==Behaviour==
The breeding season in South Asia is from December to April. In southern and eastern Australia, it is August to October, and April to June in the north and west. The nests are constructed of small branches and sticks with a bowl inside and lined with leaves, and are located in various trees, often mangroves. They show considerable site fidelity nesting in the same area year after year. In some rare instances, they have been seen to nest on the ground under trees. A clutch of two dull-white or bluish-white oval eggs measuring 52 x 41 mm is laid. Both parents take part in nest building and feeding, but likely only the female incubates. The incubation period is about 26 to 27 days.

It is primarily a scavenger, feeding mainly on dead fish and crabs, especially in wetlands and marshland, but occasionally hunts live prey such as hares and bats. They may also indulge in kleptoparasitism and attempt to steal prey from other birds. Brahminy kites have even been recorded taking advantage of Irrawaddy dolphins herding fish to the surface, in the Mekong River. A rare instance of a bird feeding on honey at the hive of &quot;Apis florea&quot; has been recorded. It also eats rice or cooked food left as an offering in India.

Young birds may indulge in play behaviour, dropping leaves and attempting to catch them in the air. When fishing over water, they may sometimes land in the water, but manage to swim and take off without much trouble.

They roost communally on large and isolated trees and as many as 600 have been seen at one location.

They may mob larger raptors such as the &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles. In some incidents where brahminy kites mobbed steppe eagles (&quot;Aquila rapax&quot;), they were attacked and injured or killed.

A number of ectoparasitic bird lice in the genera &quot;Kurodaia&quot;, &quot;Colpocephalum&quot;, and &quot;Degeeriella&quot; have been reported.

==In culture==
Known as elang bondol in Indonesia, the brahminy kite is the official mascot of Jakarta. In Hinduism, it is considered as the contemporary representation of Garuda, the sacred bird of Vishnu.

In Malaysia, the island of Langkawi off the northeast coast of the peninsula is named after the bird (&quot;kawi&quot; denoting an ochre-like stone used to decorate pottery, and a reference to the bird&#x27;s primary plumage colour). For the Ibans of the Upper Rajang, Sarawak, Malaysia, a brahminy kite is believed to be the manifestation of Singalang Burung when he comes down to earth. Singalang Burung is the ultimate deity of incomparable qualities and superior abilities in every dimension. He is also known as the god of war.

A fable from central Bougainville Island relates how a mother left her baby under a banana tree while gardening, and the baby floated into the sky crying and transformed into &quot;Kaa&#x27;nang&quot;, the brahminy kite, its necklace becoming the bird&#x27;s feathers.

<text>Judge Cassandra Anderson is a fictional law enforcer and psychic appearing in the British science fiction comics &quot;2000 AD&quot; and the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot;. Created by writer John Wagner and artist Brian Bolland, Anderson made her debut as a supporting character in the &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; story &quot;Judge Death&quot; (&quot;2000 AD&quot; #150, February 1980). The character&#x27;s popularity with readers led to her starring in her own series, &quot;Anderson: Psi-Division&quot;, which (since 1988) has been written almost exclusively by Alan Grant, often working with artist Arthur Ranson until 2005; Boo Cook drew a majority of the stories until 2012, since which a number of different artists have worked on the strip. In 2012, the character appeared in the film &quot;Dredd&quot;, played by Olivia Thirlby.

== Publication history ==
John Wagner created both Judge Death and Judge Anderson for the &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; story &quot;Judge Death&quot;, the latter helping introduce the Psi-Judges, which were seen as a natural progression. A popular misconception is that artist Brian Bolland based the character on Debbie Harry, due to the mistaken belief that he had recently drawn the singer into an advertisement for the Forbidden Planet 2 store in London. &quot;2000 AD&quot;&#x27;s former editor Kelvin Gosnell has recounted that the comic&#x27;s assistant editor Deirdre Vine at the time was the inspiration for the character, having been surreptitiously photographed across the office and the snap then given to Bolland who was told to, &quot;Make Anderson look like that.&quot;

Shortly afterwards, Alan Grant began to co-write &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; with Wagner. When Anderson got her own series, Wagner and Grant also co-authored those stories. This collaboration lasted until 1988, when their differences of opinion about how to develop Dredd&#x27;s character came to a head while planning the last episode of the &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; story &quot;Oz&quot;. After that, Grant wrote Anderson&#x27;s stories on his own, while Wagner wrote Dredd&#x27;s.

Grant later said: &quot;A lot of Anderson counts among what I think of as my best work. The fact that I&#x27;ve had one of the best storytellers in the business, Arthur Ranson, along for most of the ride makes it even more memorable for me.&quot;

== Fictional character biography ==
Like the mythical Cassandra (the sister of Paris of Troy), Judge Anderson (b. 2080) has psychic powers, chiefly telepathy and precognition. These abilities made her a member of Mega-City One&#x27;s &#x27;Psi Division&#x27; of Judges.

The character debuts during the first attack by Judge Death of the Dark Judges (a group of nihilistic undead Judges). During this encounter, Anderson is possessed by Judge Death but then thwarts him by having herself entombed in &quot;Boing&quot;, a tough but porous material. This lasts until the Dark Judges free her to release Judge Death, whereafter Anderson returns to active duty. She is instrumental in stopping this first attack by the Dark Judges, as well as several others. Due to being possessed and manipulated by them, Anderson develops a personal hatred of the Dark Judges.

Anderson is prominent in her Division and gains Dredd&#x27;s respect. Unlike Dredd, she is a critic of the weaknesses in the judicial system of Mega-City One, has a sense of humour, forms personal friendships with fellow Judges, and permits herself doubt and remorse. However, she is still capable and willing like any Judge of using extreme or lethal force against anyone, men, women or children when necessary. Because her determination is similar to Dredd&#x27;s, the two of them co-operate effectively on several missions.

In the story &quot;Engram&quot;, Anderson regains memories of an abusive father and is shocked to learn that her Division was responsible for blocking them from her mind in the first place. This, together with the events of &quot;Leviathan&#x27;s Farewell&quot; (concerning the suicide of her friend Judge Corey), &quot;Shamballa&quot;, &quot;The Jesus Syndrome&quot; and &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;, prompts Anderson to resign from the judicial system. After several adventures in outer space, she returns to Mega-City One. Dredd and Anderson are both considered veterans and regarded with awe by less experienced judges.

Later, after a deadly run-in with Judge Death, Anderson falls into a coma and is infected with the psychic Half-Life virus. A team of Psi-Judges succeeded in rescuing Anderson, but the Half-Life passes to Judge Gistane, who is then tortured by the mad Judge Fauster. When Half-Life is unleashed on the city, causing a wave of mass murder, Anderson stops it. Since she awoke from her coma, Anderson is now 60 (as of 2018). Being a Psi prevents her from using drugs and treatments Street Judges use to stay active despite aging. Because of this, Anderson expects to age beyond usefulness.

== Alternative comic versions ==
*In 1994 DC Comics began publishing the short-lived title &quot;Judge Dredd – Legends of the Law&quot;, which featured their own version of Dredd. Issues 1–4 featured Anderson as a cadet in a story called &quot;The Organ Donors&quot; (1994–1995), written by John Wagner and Alan Grant and illustrated by Brent Anderson and Jimmy Palmiotti. (Note that the Anderson in the Judge Dredd and Batman crossover stories is the original &quot;2000 AD&quot; version of the character.)
* In 2012 issue #2 of IDW Publishing&#x27;s new &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; title included Anderson. IDW gave Anderson her own comic in 2014. That lasted for four issues.
* In 2016 the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot; published stories based on the version of Anderson which had appeared in the 2012 film &quot;Dredd&quot;, in issues 377 to 379. &quot;The Deep End&quot; was written by Alec Worley, with art by Paul Davidson. &quot;Judgement Call&quot; was written by Worley, with art by Lee Carter.

<text>Kumārajīva (Sanskrit: कुमारजीव; , 344–413 CE) was a Buddhist monk, scholar, missionary and translator from Kucha (present-day Aksu Prefecture, Xinjiang, China). Kumārajīva is seen as one of the greatest translators of Chinese Buddhism. According to Lu Cheng, Kumarajiva&#x27;s translations are &quot;unparalleled either in terms of translation technique or degree of fidelity&quot;.

Kumārajīva first studied teachings of the Sarvastivadin schools, later studied under Buddhasvāmin, and finally became an adherent of Mahayana Buddhism, studying the Mādhyamaka doctrine of Nāgārjuna. After mastering the Chinese language, Kumārajīva settled as a translator and scholar in Chang&#x27;an (c. 401 CE) under the patronage of the Later Qin dynasty during the Sixteen Kingdoms period. He was the head of a team of translators which included his amanuensis Sengrui. This team was responsible for the translation of many Sanskrit Buddhist texts into Chinese. 

Kumārajīva also introduced the Madhyamaka school of Buddhist philosophy into China which would later be called Sanlun (the &quot;Three Treatise school&quot;).

==Life==

=== Early life ===
Kumārajīva was born in the kingdom of Kucha in the Tarim Basin in 344 CE. His father was an Indian monk called Kumārāyana who was probably from Kashmir while his mother was a member of the Kucha royal family called Jīva. 

Himself an eminent Buddhist monk, Kumārāyana endeavoured to journey from his native Kashmir to China to spread his Buddhist teachings. After crossing the Pamir Mountains, Kumārāyana stopped in Kucha, where he stayed as a guest of the king. The king of Kucha was so impressed with Kumārāyana’s ideas that the king proposed the marriage of his younger sister Jīva (also known as Jīvaka), a Kuchan princess and herself a devout Buddhist, to Kumārāyana. Kumārāyana and Jīva both acquiesced to this marriage. It was therefore that Kumārajīva’s father Kumārāyana settled in Kucha, became the royal priest, met Kumārajīva’s mother Jīva who influenced both his own subsequent Buddhist studies and later those of their son, and thereafter begat Kumārajīva.

When Kumārajīva was just seven, his mother Jīva joined the Tsio-li nunnery, north of Kucha. Beginning at the age of nine, Kumārajīva studied the Agamas and the Sarvastivada Abhidharma under masters in North India, Kashmir, and Kucha: all centers of Sarvastivada monasticism and scholarship. He later converted to and studied Mahayana under the Kashmirian Buddhayaśas in Kashgar.

In Kucha at the age of 20, Kumārajīva received full monastic ordination. Around this time he also began to study the Sarvastivada Vinaya and the Madhyamaka philosophy. Over his early life, Kumārajīva became a famous figure in Buddhism, known for his breadth of studies and skill in debate.

===Capture, imprisonment and release===
In 379 CE, Kumārajīva&#x27;s fame reached China when a Chinese Buddhist monk named Seng Jun visited Kucha and described Kumārajīva&#x27;s abilities. Efforts were then made by Emperor Fu Jian (苻堅) of the Former Qin Dynasty to bring Kumārajīva to the Qin capital of Chang&#x27;an. To do this, his general Lü Guang was dispatched with an army in order to conquer Kucha and return with Kumārajīva. Fu Jian is recorded as telling his general, &quot;Send me Kumārajīva as soon as you conquer Kucha.&quot; However, when Fu Jian&#x27;s main army at the capital was defeated, his general Lü Guang declared his own state and became a warlord in 386 CE, and had Kumārajīva captured when he was around 40 years old. Being a non-Buddhist, Lü Guang had Kumārajīva imprisoned for many years, essentially as booty. During this time, it is thought that Kumārajīva became familiar with the Chinese language. Kumārajīva was also coerced by Lü into marrying the Kucha King&#x27;s daughter, and so he was forced to give up his monk&#x27;s vows. 

After the Yao family of Later Qin overthrew the previous ruler Fu Jian, the ruler Yao Xing made repeated pleas to the warlords of the Lü family to free Kumārajīva and send him east to Chang&#x27;an. When the Lü family would not free Kumārajīva from their hostage, an exasperated Yao Xing had armies dispatched to Liangzhou in order to defeat the warlords of the Lü family and to have Kumārajīva brought back to them. Finally the armies of Emperor Yao succeeded in defeating the Lü family, and Kumārajīva was brought east to the capital of Chang&#x27;an in 401 CE.

===Chang&#x27;an and translation work===

At Chang&#x27;an, Kumārajīva was introduced to the emperor Yao Xing, the court, and the Buddhist leaders. He became a famous and well respected in China, being given the title of &quot;National Preceptor&quot; (&quot;guoshi&quot;). At Chang&#x27;an, Kumārajīva led a court sponsored translation team of scholars who worked on translating numerous Sanskrit Buddhist texts into the Chinese language. Yao Xing looked upon him as his own teacher, and many young and old Chinese Buddhists flocked to him, learning both from his direct teachings and through his translation bureau activities at the Xiaoyao Gardens where daily sessions were held (attended by over a thousand monks). Within a dozen years, Kumārajīva&#x27;s translation bureau had translated about thirty five sutras in 294 scrolls. His translations are still in use today in Chinese Buddhism. Kumarajiva had four main disciples who worked on his team: Daosheng (竺道生), Sengzhao (僧肇), Daorong (道融), and Sengrui (僧睿).
According to Paul Williams, &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa&quot;, a text translated by him, also has a clear association with the Vaibhāṣikas (Sarvāstivādins).

==Scholarly work==
=== Translation ===
Kumārajīva revolutionized Chinese Buddhism, and his team&#x27;s translation style is known for its clarity and for overcoming the previous &quot;geyi&quot; (concept-matching) system of translation which matched Buddhist terminology with Daoist and Confucian terms. Kumārajīva&#x27;s readable translation style was distinctive, possessing a flowing smoothness that reflects his prioritization on conveying the meaning as opposed to precise literal rendering. Because of this, his renderings of seminal Mahāyāna texts have often remained more popular than later, more literal translations, e.g. those of Xuanzang. 

Kumārajīva&#x27;s translations were very influential on the development of Buddhist Chinese and they introduced much commonly used terminology, such as:

* 大乘 &quot;&quot;Dà chéng&quot;&quot;, or &quot;greater vehicle&quot;, for the Sanskrit term Mahāyāna
* 念處 &quot;&quot;niàn chǔ&quot; for Smṛtyupasthāna (placement of mindfulness)
* 菩提 &quot;pú tí&quot; for Bodhi (awakening)
* 性 &quot;xìng&quot;&quot; for Dhatū (nature, source)

These translations were a group effort and therefore it is more accurate to say that they were translated by a committee which was guided by Kumārajīva, not by Kumārajīva alone. The process of translation began with the reading of the text by Kumārajīva who would also give a running commentary in Chinese. The Chinese monks and students would discuss the text with Kumārajīva and among themselves. A translation in Chinese would emerge from this process, which would be checked by Kumārajīva. The text was then written down and revised numerous times. These were also public events which were attended by devotees, including emperor Yao Xing.

Kumārajīva also developed a system of transcription in order to render Sanskrit terms in Chinese by using certain Chinese characters and their sounds to represent each syllable of a foreign word. This system would go on to become the basis of the development of pinyin romanization. This encounter with Sanskrit influenced the development of the Chinese language itself, not only in the adoption of specifically Buddhist terms, but also regarding certain secular terms as well (such as &quot;moment&quot;). 

Kumārajīva has sometimes been regarded by both the Chinese and by western scholars as abbreviating his translations, with later translators such as Xuanzang being regarded as being more &quot;precise.&quot; According to Jan Nattier, this is actually an erroneous and mistaken view, and the main difference was due to the earlier versions of Kumarajiva&#x27;s source texts:

===Translated Texts===
According to John M. Thompson &quot;at present there are fifty two translations in the Taishō under his name and their authenticity is fairly well accepted.&quot; They include Mahāyāna sutras as well as works on Buddhist meditation (dhyāna) and Abhidharma.

==== Sutras ====
Among the most important sutras translated by Kumārajīva and his team (probably from Kuchan target sources) are the following:

* &quot;Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Diamond Sutra&quot;) 
* &quot;Smaller Sukhāvatī-vyūha&quot; (T 366)
* &quot;Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra (Lotus Sutra)&quot; (T 263–62)
* &quot;Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra&quot; (T 475)
* &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;, (T 227, 408 CE)
*&quot;Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra (&quot;T 223, 403–404 CE)
*&quot;Śūraṅgama Samādhi Sūtra&quot; (T 642)
*&quot;Daśabhūmikā Sūtra&quot; (T 286) in collaboration with Buddhayaśas.
*&quot;Acintyaprabhāsa-nirdeśa-sūtra&quot; (T 484) 
*&quot;Viśeṣacintā-brahma-paripṛcchā&quot; (T 585–86)
*&quot;Bhadrakalpa&quot; (T 425) 
*&quot;Vasudhara-sūtra&quot; (T 481–82)
*&quot;Pūrṇa-paripṛcchā&quot; ( T 310, 17) 
*&quot;Ratnajāli-paripṛcchā&quot; (T 433) 
*&quot;Vidhi-hṛdaya-vyūha&quot; (T 307) 
*&quot;Sarva-puṇya-samuccaya-samādhi-sūtra&quot; (T 381–82)
*&quot;Maitreyavyākaraṇa Sūtra&quot; 

==== Treatises ====
They also translated several key treatises (mainly of the Madhyamaka school), which became the central works of East Asian Madhyamaka Buddhism. These are:

* &quot;The Middle Treatise&quot; (Ch. 中論, pinyin: &quot;Zhonglun&quot;, T. 1564; Skt. &quot;Madhyamakaśāstra&quot;), comprising Nāgārjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; (&quot;Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way&quot;) alongside a commentary by *Vimalākṣa / *Piṅgala (Ch. 青目, pinyin: Qingmu).

* &quot;The Treatise on the Twelve Gates&quot; (Ch. 十二門論, pinyin: &quot;Shiermenlun,&quot; T. 1568), allegedly Nāgārjuna&#x27;s *&quot;Dvādaśadvāraśāstra&quot;, also reconstructed as *&quot;Dvādaśamukhaśāstra&quot; or as *&quot;Dvādaśanikāyaśāstra.&quot;

* &quot;The Hundred(-Verse) Treatise&quot; (Ch. 百論, pinyin: &quot;Bailun&quot;, T. 1569; Skt. &quot;Śatakaśāstra&quot;, or &quot;Śataśāstra&quot;), consisting of a commentary by a certain master Vasu on some verses by Āryadeva.

* &quot;Commentary on the Great Perfection of Wisdom&quot; (Ch. 大智度論, pinyin: &quot;Dazhidulun&quot;, T. 1509; Skt. &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa&quot;). A commentary on the &quot;Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; attributed to Nāgārjuna, but this attribution is disputed by some modern scholars.
*&quot;Satyasiddhi Shastra&quot; (&quot;Ch&#x27;eng-shih lun&quot;) – This Abhidharma text, while not being a work of Madhyamaka, was influential on Chinese Madhyamaka, since it also taught the emptiness of dharmas.
Other treatises that the team worked on include the &quot;Daśabhūmika-vibhāṣā&quot; (T. 1521)&quot;,&quot; a commentary to the &quot;Daśabhūmikā Sūtra&quot; attributed to Nagarjuna and the &quot;Treatise On Arising Bodhicitta&quot; (T. 1659).

==== Meditation texts ====
Kumārajīva and his team also translated some treatises on meditation (&quot;dhyāna&quot;). In the Taisho Tripitaka (vol. 15), five meditation works are attributed to Kumārajīva:

*&quot;Scripture of the Secret Essentials of Dhyāna&quot; (T. 613. &quot;Chan mi yao fa jing&quot; 禪祕要法經)
*&quot;Scripture on the Samādhi of Sitting Dhyāna&quot; (T. 614. &quot;Zuòchán sān mēi jīng&quot; 坐禪三昧經), ZSJ (also called the &quot;Bodhisattvadhyāna Pusa Chanfa Jing&quot; 菩薩禪法經 or &quot;The Scripture on the Practice of Dhyāna in The Wilderness&quot; &quot;E lan Rou Xi Chan Fa Jing&quot; 阿蘭若習禪法經).
*&quot;Scripture on the Bodhisattva&#x27;s Methods of Censuring Sexual Desire&quot; (T. 615. &quot;Pusa he seyu fa jing&quot; 菩薩訶色欲法經)
*&quot;Essential Explanation of The Method of Dhyāna&quot; (T. 616. &quot;Chán fǎ yào jiě&quot; 禪法要解).
*&quot;The Abridged Essence of Dhyāna&quot; (T. 617. &quot;Siwei Lue Yao Fa&quot; 思惟略要法)
Scholars are divided on how many of these were actually worked on by Kumārajīva (though T. 613 and T. 614 are well attested in early catalogs and prefaces). Furthermore, Chinese sources indicate that these works were edited, summarized and extracted from Indian sources. Eric Greene explains that the main methods of mediation taught in T. 614 are the &quot;five gates of chan&quot; (五門禪) &quot;associated with the so-called yogācāras of northwest India&quot;, which &quot;became a standard arrangement in later writings on meditation&quot; and are the following:

* the contemplation of the impure (bu jing guan 不淨觀; aśubha-bhāvanā) for those beset by lust, 
* the cultivation of love (ci xin 慈心; the four apramāṇa meditations) for those with aversion, 
* the contemplation of dependent origination (yin yuan 因 緣; pratītyasamutpāda) for those with ignorance, 
* meditation on the breath (nian xi 念息; ānāpāna-smṛti) for those with &quot;excessive thinking&quot; (多思覺人; vitarka), and
* recollection of the Buddha (nian fo 念佛; buddhānusmṛti) for those with &quot;equally distributed&quot; (等分) defilements.

After having calmed the mind and entered dhyāna (chan 禪) through these methods, the meditator then proceeds to develop wisdom (prajñā) by cultivating the four &quot;foundations of mindfulness&quot; (si nian chu 思念處; smṛtyupasthāna). According to Greene, &quot;following this, one moves through the so-called four nirvedha-bhāgīya-kuśalamūla (si shan gen 四善根), the &quot;roots of good that lead to liberation&quot;, which in the Sarvāstivādin system are the highest levels of mundane accomplishment. This in turn leads to the so-called “path of vision” (darśana-maraga), a sequence of sixteen mental moments in which, by means of insight into the four noble truths.&quot; 

While T. 614 discusses the path of hinayana as well as the bodhisattva path, the actual meditation practices are not different, they are just approached in different ways. For example, the bodhisattva practices the same contemplation of impurity as the sravaka, but they are also warned not to become so disgusted with the world that they seek immediate nirvāṇa. Instead, a bodhisattva should always practice these meditations with the wish for perfecting themselves in order to help others. As such, Kumārajīva seems to have understood the practice of a bodhisattva to have consisted of the same methods of meditation found in śrāvaka-yāna sources, the only difference being that bodhisattvas have a different motivation and a different goal (Buddhahood). 

==== Other ====
Other translations include the &quot;Da zhuang yan jing lun&quot; 大莊嚴經論 &quot;(*Mahālaṃkāra-sūtra-śāstra) &quot;of Asvaghosa and &quot;Samyukta avadana sutra.&quot;

According to Robinson,Kumārajīva&#x27;s additions to the Vinaya section of the Chinese canon are the &quot;Sarvāstivāda-vinaya&quot; (T. 1435), the &quot;Sarvāstivāda&quot;-&quot;prātimokṣa-sutra&quot; (T. 1436), and, according to tradition, the Pu-sa-chieh-p n (&quot;bodhisattva-prātimokṣa&quot;), which is probably the second half of the present &quot;Brahmajala-sutra&quot; (T. 1484).

=== Original works and philosophy ===

Kumārajīva is also known to have authored a few original works, including his &quot;Commentary on the Vimalakīrti-nirdesa-sūtra&quot; (&quot;Zhu Weimojie Jing.&quot; Taisho number 1775) and the &quot;Shixiang lun&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Tattva,&quot; now lost). Kumārajīva and his team are also responsible for a biography of Nagarjuna (T. 2047), which may have been based on Kumārajīva&#x27;s own accounts to his students.

Another text which contains some original teachings by Kumārajīva is the &quot;Jiumoluoshi fashi dayi&quot; (The Great Teaching of Dharma Master Kumārajīva; T. no. 1856), which is a series of letters between Kumārajīva and Lushan Huiyuan (334–416) discussing some basic Mahayana topics. 

Regarding Kumārajīva&#x27;s own philosophical views, according to Richard H. Robinson:He shows himself to be an orthodox Śūnyavādin and Mādhyamika, rejects the authority of the Abhidharma, and interprets the Āgamas in a Mahāyāna way, holds that the Buddha&#x27;s statements are purely pragmatic and do not imply any real entities, and denies that real entities arise, because (a) neither inherence nor non-inherence of the effect in the cause is admissible, and (b) simultaneous and successive occurrence of cause and effect are alike untenable. He maintains that reality transcends the four modes of the tetralemma, and he holds Nagarjuna&#x27;s concept of negation.Likewise, according to John M. Thompson, the philosophy which emerges from the explanations of Kumārajīva is &quot;virtually identical to the views of Nagarjuna and other Madhyamikas, stressing the emptiness of all dharmas (even the &quot;emptiness of emptiness&quot;) and the Bodhisattva&#x27;s non-attachment to all things and teachings&quot;. 

Thompson adds,Like both the &quot;Prajñāpāramita&quot; sutras and Madhyamika commentaries, Kumārajīva says that the Buddha&#x27;s teachings ultimately come from and lead us to a level beyond words and thought. Because the Buddha and Bodhisattvas reside in this transcendent realm (which is none other than our present world) their wisdom enables them to use various upaya to lead suffering beings to enlightenment. Apparent contradictions and confusions in Buddhist texts are due to their upāya, which accommodate to the audience&#x27;s level and lead them to the truth. Kumārajīva even suggests that the teachings in the sutras may delude those who are unprepared, i.e. at a lower level of understanding. According to Kumārajīva, we truly understand the Dharma only when we attain complete and pure &quot;prajñā&quot;. &quot;Prajñā&quot; is the means of removing all obstacles and hindrances, all attachments–even attachments to itself. As Kumārajīva says, &quot;In the Buddha-Dharma, the medicine of &quot;prajñā&quot; is just like this. By this medicine, one demolishes the objects of addictions. If within &quot;prajñā&quot; beings then conceive addiction, then one must practice a method of treatment. If within &quot;prajñā&quot; there are no addictions to &quot;prajñā&quot;, then further treatment is not applied.&quot; These ideas are found in the &quot;Dazhidulun&quot; (T. 1509; Skt. &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa&quot;). Various modern scholars also hold that the &quot;Dazhidulun&quot;, which was traditionally held to be an original work of Nagarjuna that was translated by Kumārajīva&#x27;s team, actually contains numerous additions by Kumārajīva and his team or is actually a product of the editorship of Kumārajīva&#x27;s student Sengrui. As Etienne Lamotte notes, Kumārajīva&#x27;s team also edited and abridged the latter half of this text considerably.

=== Influence ===
According to Rafal Felbur, The translations associated with his name – executed both from Prakrits, i.e. vernacular forms of Sanskrit, and from early forms of Buddhist Sanskrit, into a form of classical Chinese – have enjoyed enormous success in the Sinitic tradition. This success is so great that even when, in the subsequent centuries, other scholars produced new and supposedly improved translations of the same texts, it has been the “Kumarajiva versions” that have remained in use in the devotional, exegetical, and literary life of East Asia up to the present day. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, as the Sinitic Buddhist traditions have contributed to the emergence of a distinctly global modernist Buddhism, the Kumarajiva corpus of early fifth-century translations has been an implicit major presence.Aside from the linguistic and terminological influence of Kumārajīva&#x27;s translation work, his work also influenced the philosophical understanding of Buddhism in China. According to Fan Muyou, before Kumārajīva, many Chinese Buddhists had serious misunderstandings of emptiness and not-self. This is because they had been influenced by Neo-Taoist Xuanxue philosophy and thus they saw emptiness as either a kind of non-being, as a real, or absolute substance (both of which are mistaken interpretations of the concepts of &quot;śūnyatā&quot; and &quot;anatman&quot;). Kumārajīva and his students like Sengzhao and Sengrui recognized these errors and worked to correct them by introducing proper interpretations based on Indian Madhyamaka philosophy.

<doc id="201280" wikidata="Q1756461" url="?curid=201280" title="To the Manor Born">
<text>To the Manor Born is a BBC television sitcom that first aired on BBC1 from 1979 to 1981. A special one-off episode was produced in 2007. Starring Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles, the first 20 episodes and the 2007 special were written by Peter Spence, the creator, while the final episode in 1981 was written by script associate Christopher Bond. The title is a play on the phrase &quot;to the manner born,&quot; from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (&quot;Though I am a native here and to the manner born, it is a custom more honoured in the breach than the observance&quot;.)

In &quot;To the Manor Born&quot;, Penelope Keith (who was previously best known for her role as social-climber Margo Leadbetter in the suburban sitcom &quot;The Good Life&quot;), plays upper-class Audrey fforbes-Hamilton. Upon the death of her husband, Audrey is forced to sell her vast country estate, Grantleigh Manor. However, she then moves into the estate&#x27;s small, modest lodge house (where she can keep an eye on the estate&#x27;s new owner) and manages to keep her butler and her much loved Rolls-Royce 20/25 car. The manor is bought by Richard DeVere (played by Peter Bowles), a nouveau riche millionaire supermarket owner originally from Czechoslovakia. DeVere and fforbes-Hamilton have a love-hate relationship.

The programme proved popular and it received high audience figures for many of its episodes, especially the series 1 final episode, the most watched British television programme (excluding live events) of the 1970s.

==Production==
===Development===
Peter Spence first thought of the idea behind &quot;To the Manor Born&quot; in the early 1970s when he was working for BBC Radio as a gag writer. One of the programmes that Spence wrote for featured a Cockney comedian, who had recently bought a manor house in an English country village. When holding a housewarming party, the comedian invited the previous occupant, a widow who could not afford to keep the house up and had moved to a smaller house in the village. The comedian&#x27;s account of the lady, and the conversation he had with her, Spence later described as a &quot;perfect description&quot; of Audrey.

A few years later, following the success of &quot;The Good Life&quot;, Spence was asked by BBC Radio to come up with an idea for a programme to feature Keith. Thinking of Keith&#x27;s character in &quot;The Good Life&quot;, Spence had the idea of inverting the character of Margo Leadbetter (who was middle-class but trying desperately to climb the social ladder; Audrey on the other hand genuinely &quot;was&quot; from an aristocratic, upper class background, but had lost her fortune and was forced into a more humble existence) and, from the account from the comedian, came up with Audrey fforbes-Hamilton. Instead of a Cockney comedian as the new owner of the manor, Spence decided on an American who sees the manor while in England looking for his roots. The American later discovers he is descended from the fforbes-Hamiltons. This was made into a radio pilot in 1976 with Bernard Braden as the American, but was never broadcast because of the interest to make it into a TV series.

When writing the TV series, Christopher Bond was brought in as the script associate and helped to adapt the series from radio to television. The American character was changed, and the idea of a character who appeared to be an English gentleman, but turns out not to be, was thought of. It was then decided that this character needed someone who could reveal his real background, and his mother was created, although it was not until Spence had nearly finished the first series that she was written in from the beginning. The characters of Brabinger and Marjory followed soon after. The first episode aired on 30 September 1979, a year after Keith had played Margo Leadbetter for the last time in &quot;The Good Life&quot;.

===Filming===
&quot;To the Manor Born&quot; was filmed on location in Cricket St Thomas, Somerset, and in Studio TC1 at the BBC&#x27;s Television Centre in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London. The manor, Cricket House, was at the time of the original series owned by the father-in-law of Peter Spence, the show&#x27;s creator and writer. Some interior scenes were also filmed inside Cricket House. The Old Lodge, which on screen was at the end of the manor&#x27;s drive, is in fact about one mile away and called West Lodge. A false gatepost was installed to help the illusion that the two are close together. The 2007 special was, like the original series, filmed on location in Cricket St Thomas. This filming took place for about a week starting on 28 October 2007. The studio footage was filmed in front of a live audience at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire on 25 November 2007.

All the episodes were directed by Gareth Gwenlan, who also produced the original series. The 2007 special was co-produced by Gwenlan and Justin Davies.

During the filming, many cars were used; but the BBC continued to use the same vintage Rolls-Royce through the entire series, including the opening titles for the show. The Rolls-Royce (BMG443) has also been used in other BBC programmes such as &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;.

==Cast==
The cast is led by Penelope Keith as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton and Peter Bowles as Richard de Vere. The other main cast members in the original series are Angela Thorne (playing Audrey&#x27;s old friend Marjory), Daphne Heard (Richard&#x27;s mother, Mrs. Polouvicka), John Rudling (Brabinger the butler), Michael Bilton (Ned, the odd-job man) and Gerald Sim (the Rector). Rudling was absent in the 1979 Christmas special and for much of the second series due to his ill health; his character was temporarily replaced as butler by Ned. Rudling died in 1983. Angela Thorne had worked with Keith before when she had played Lady &quot;George&quot; Truscott in a 1977 episode of &quot;The Good Life&quot;.

Peter Bowles had been asked some years earlier to play Jerry Leadbetter, the husband of Keith&#x27;s Margo, in &quot;The Good Life&quot;. Owing to prior commitments, Bowles turned down the role, but had he played Jerry, it is unlikely he would have been offered the part of Richard; as Bowles later said, &quot;There&#x27;s no way I could have played Penelope Keith&#x27;s screen husband in two separate sitcoms.&quot; However, in 1987 Bowles replaced Geoffrey Palmer as Keith&#x27;s onscreen husband in the ITV sitcom &quot;Executive Stress&quot;.

The series also features many recurring characters, who are either estate workers or members of Audrey&#x27;s social circle. Celia Imrie, who makes two appearances as supermarket cashier Polly, later became known for her work with Victoria Wood, including the sitcom &quot;Dinnerladies&quot;, as well as roles in &quot;Kingdom&quot; and &quot;After You&#x27;ve Gone&quot;.

The 2007 Christmas special features four of the original cast members: Penelope Keith, Peter Bowles, Angela Thorne, and Gerald Sim as the Rector. New characters include Alexander Armstrong as Adam fforbes-Hamilton, Audrey&#x27;s nephew-by-marriage and godson; Alan David as Emmeridge, Audrey and Richard&#x27;s outspoken butler; and Michael Cochrane as Archie Pennington-Booth, a neighbouring landowner. While the Rector makes only a brief appearance, the other three original characters are main characters throughout and are credited in the opening credits.


==Plot==

===Original series===
&quot;To the Manor Born&quot; is set in the fictional village of Grantleigh in Somerset, near the fictional town of Marlbury. The series begins with the funeral of Marton (&quot;sic&quot;) fforbes-Hamilton, the Lord of the Manor of Grantleigh. Audrey, his widow (and apparently also his cousin), is far from distraught, as she now has control of the Grantleigh Manor Estate, which her family, the fforbes-Hamiltons, have controlled for 400 years. Her joy is short-lived though, as her solicitor, Arnold Plunkett, informs her that Marton was bankrupt and that the manor will have to be sold to pay off the debts. Audrey tries to buy back the manor at auction, but is outbid at £876,000. The new Lord of the Manor is Richard DeVere, a recently widowed self-made millionaire who started his career on an East End fruit barrow and founded the Cavendish Foods supermarket chain, though Audrey calls him a costermonger and sees him simply as a grocer. DeVere brings his domineering mother, Maria Poulouvicka (who is nicknamed by Audrey as &#x27;Mrs. Poo&#x27;). She reveals to Audrey, who does not like foreigners, that she and her son came to Britain in 1939 from Czechoslovakia, and that Richard, whose real name is Bedřich Polouvicek, is half-Polish (on his late father Lazlo&#x27;s side) and half-Czech. Mrs. Polouvicka tries hard to fit into British country life, but her accent often leads to many mispronunciations and she frequently comes out with sayings from her &quot;old Czechoslovakia&quot;. From early on in the series, she encourages her son to court Audrey.

Audrey moves into the &quot;Old Lodge&quot;, at the end of the drive, where she can see most of what goes on at the manor. Living with her is her elderly and loyal butler, Brabinger, who has worked for the fforbes-Hamiltons his whole life, and her beagle Bertie. Audrey&#x27;s supportive best friend, and a frequent visitor, is the well-meaning Marjory Frobisher, who quickly develops a crush on DeVere. Marjory, who was at school with Audrey, is still a schoolgirl at heart and a committed countryside campaigner. Marjory has no organisational ability, which leads to her being nicknamed &quot;Muddlesome Marj&quot; by some. Despite Marjory&#x27;s encouragement, Audrey refuses to get a job, saying her only job could be running the Grantleigh Estate and doing other public service, which includes her being a magistrate. This means that money is a constant problem and Audrey has to learn to live within her means and new circumstances. During the second series, Brabinger is away ill; and Ned, whose tied cottage is being renovated by Richard, takes over as Audrey&#x27;s butler. Ned, a gardener and &quot;outside man&quot;, has worked on the estate all his life and finds working indoors difficult to get used to and he tends to lack the refined characteristics that a trained butler such as Brabinger possessed. Other estate staff include the estate foreman Mr. Miller, the new estate manager Mr. Spalding and the cook Mrs. Beecham. Another character, Polly, originally works at the local &quot;Cavendish Foods&quot; supermarket and then at the doctors&#x27; surgery, while Linda Cartwright works in the stables and as a domestic. The postman, Mr. Purvis, appears in two episodes.

Other characters include the local rector, who is not unhappy when Audrey loses the manor, hoping that it will prevent the dominating Audrey from having a say in the running of the church and local causes. The rector favours Richard, who is frequently generous when it comes to donations to church funds. The village shop is run by Mrs. Patterson, the local gossip who also favours Richard and does not get on with Audrey. The typically English Brigadier Lemington, of the Somerset Rifles and a former Desert Rat, is another local landowner and friend of Audrey&#x27;s and the Master of Foxhounds and, like Audrey and Marjory, has an interest in nature conservation and cricket. Arnold Plunkett and his wife Dorothy are friends of Audrey, while Arnold is also the family solicitor. Grantleigh&#x27;s local estate agent is J.J. Anderson, of Anderson and Fish, who appears at manor parties.

During the course of the three series, Audrey and Richard grow closer. Hostile to each other at the start, they grew to understand and respect each other, as both try to adapt to each other&#x27;s ways. The last two 1981 episodes show Richard having problems at his company Cavendish Foods. With his board of directors refusing to let Richard buy a refrigeration plant in Argentina, he seriously considers selling the manor to raise the money to buy the plant himself. Trying to help Richard, Audrey asks her uncle, a well-respected and connected member of the financial community, to lend Richard a hand. Thanks to him, things begin to go Richard&#x27;s way. Unfortunately, Audrey&#x27;s uncle dies before the deals are signed. Richard decides to sell the manor to pay for the refrigerated plant. By a twist of fate, Audrey inherits her uncle&#x27;s fortune and buys the manor back. Now back home and on her own turf, Audrey asks Richard to marry her. Taken aback, Richard says yes and they are married in the final episode, broadcast on 29 November 1981.

===2007 Christmas special===
As Richard and Audrey plan to celebrate their silver wedding anniversary, each planning a surprise party for the other, Richard confesses to Audrey that he owns Farmer Tom, a company that has been putting the neighbouring estates out of business. Audrey leaves him and goes to stay with Marjory, much to the latter&#x27;s displeasure. Richard visits his mother&#x27;s grave to develop a plan to win Audrey back. He decides to allow a rock concert to be held on the estate. When the licence application is up before the magistrates&#x27; court, Richard changes his mind. The following day, their anniversary, Marjory leads Audrey to a surprise party organised by Richard.

New characters in the 2007 Christmas special include Emmeridge, the outspoken butler replacing Brabinger; Adam fforbes-Hamilton, Marton&#x27;s nephew and Audrey&#x27;s godson, who has recently moved to Grantleigh to learn how to run an estate; and Archie Pennington-Booth, a neighbouring landowner driven to bankruptcy by Farmer Tom. Marjory now lives in the Old Lodge that Audrey occupied during the original series, and she and Adam develop a romantic interest in each other. A small acknowledgement of Bertie and Brabinger appears in the special, consisting of a photo of Brabinger and a small beagle statuette on a side table. Richard&#x27;s mother, &quot;Mrs. Poo&quot;, is acknowledged by a marble headstone in the church graveyard and a framed photograph on the mantel of the manor&#x27;s sitting room.

==Episodes==
&quot;To the Manor Born&quot; ran for three series and one Christmas special from 30 September 1979 to 29 November 1981. Each episode is half an hour long. The first series aired for seven episodes on Sundays at 8.45 pm, the second series for six episodes on Sundays at 8.35 pm and the seven-episode Series Three on Sundays at 7.15 pm. The Christmas special aired at 8.00 pm. All episodes aired on BBC1. A second Christmas special, announced on 24 October 2007, aired at 9.30 pm on BBC One on Christmas Day, 25 December 2007.

The theme tune for &quot;To the Manor Born&quot; was composed by Ronnie Hazlehurst, the BBC&#x27;s Light Entertainment Music Director who composed the theme tunes for many sitcoms around this time.

==Reception==

===Original series===

The programme was very popular with viewers. Several episodes received extremely high audience figures, especially the first series. This was partly due to the fact that ITV, the main rival channel to BBC1 in the United Kingdom, was in the middle of a protracted strike which started in early August 1979. This saw nearly all of the local ITV companies go off air, with no programmes being aired from the network (except Channel Television in the Channel Islands), leaving only BBC 1 and BBC 2 as the channels left for the British public to watch until Wednesday 24 October 1979, when ITV returned to air, with the strike ending in a pay agreement.

However, many viewers remained with the BBC and with shows such as &quot;To the Manor Born&quot;, as ITV took some months to get going again with new programmes. For the first month after the strike had ended, ITV found it hard to win back viewers who preferred to remain with the BBC, as ITV was airing repeats and filler programmes until new content was made from November 1979. This gave &quot;To the Manor Born&quot; a huge advantage with the viewing public.

In 1979, the last episode of the first series received 23.95 million viewers, the fourth-highest figures for any programme in the UK in the 1970s, and the highest for a non-live event. The following year, 21.55 million people watched the last episode of series two, the fifth-highest viewing figure for the 1980s. The final episode in 1981 received 17.80 million viewers. The 2007 Christmas special garnered 10.25 million viewers and ranked as the 6th most watched programme in the UK for that week.

===2007 Christmas special===
Writing in the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; on 30 December 2007, Marshall Julius described the 2007 Anniversary special as &quot;so cosy and old-fashioned that I could easily have dismissed it with a cynical wave&quot;. However, he says he found himself enjoying it &quot;about halfway through&quot; and said &quot;it was a real pleasure to see Peter Bowles and Penelope Keith, for both of whom I feel great affection, once again sparring on the small screen&quot;. Julius finished his review by commenting &quot;Not that I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;d like a whole series of it but as a one-off event it was surprisingly welcome&quot;.

The British Comedy Guide was more critical saying that &quot;whilst it gained great viewing figures it really wasn&#x27;t a patch on the original episodes.&quot;

==In other media==

===Novelisations===
The writer Peter Spence wrote two books that accompanied &quot;To the Manor Born&quot;. While they were based on the TV episodes, both books did differ with added conversations, changed storylines and the characters being given different personality traits. The first book, published in 1979 by Arrow Books, is entitled &quot;To the Manor Born&quot; and is based on the first series episodes 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7. In this book, Brabinger&#x27;s first name, which is never mentioned in the TV series, is revealed as Bertram and Ned&#x27;s surname revealed as Peaslake. The second book, titled &quot;To the Manor Born Book 2&quot;, was published by the same publisher in 1980. This is a novelisation of the 1979 Christmas special and episodes 5, 4, 3, 2 and 6 from the second series, plus an original story.

===Film version===
A film version was announced by the Rank Organisation at the Cannes Film Festival in 1980, but then was abandoned when Rank pulled out of filmmaking.

===Radio version===
In 1997, 16 years after the original series of &quot;To the Manor Born&quot; ended on television, ten 30-minute episodes were recorded for radio, the programme&#x27;s original intended medium. The episodes, originally aired on Saturdays on BBC Radio 2 from 25 January to 29 March 1997, were written by Peter Spence, six adapted from TV episodes and four new episodes. Keith and Thorne returned as Audrey and Marjory, while Keith Barron replaced Bowles as Richard. Other actors, including Frank Middlemass and Nicholas McArdle, who played Miller in the TV version, replaced many of the by then deceased original television cast members. The series has subsequently been repeated on BBC 7/BBC Radio 4 Extra. All ten episodes, collected, are now available for purchase on Audible and iTunes.

==Controversy==
The character of Richard de Vere, and his fictional company &quot;Cavendish Foods&quot; were reportedly a thinly veiled dig at businessman Sir James Goldsmith and his company Cavenham Foods.

<doc id="201285" wikidata="Q670732" url="?curid=201285" title="Religious law">
<text>Religious law includes ethical and moral codes taught by religious traditions. Examples of religiously derived legal codes include Christian canon law (applicable within a wider theological conception in the church, but in modern times distinct from secular state law), Jewish &quot;halakha&quot;, Islamic &quot;sharia&quot;, and Hindu law. In some jurisdictions, religious law may apply only to that religion&#x27;s adherents; in others, it may be enforced by civil authorities for all residents.

==Established religions and religious institutions==
A state religion (or established church) is a religious body officially endorsed by the state. A theocracy is a form of government in which a God or a deity is recognized as the supreme civil ruler.

In both theocracies and some religious jurisdictions, conscientious objectors may cause religious offense. The contrary legal systems are secular states or multicultural societies in which the government does not formally adopt a particular religion, but may either repress all religious activity or enforce tolerance of religious diversity.

==Baháʼí Faith==

Baháʼí laws are laws and ordinances used in the Baháʼí Faith and are a fundamental part of Baháʼí practice. The laws are based on authenticated texts from Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, subsequent interpretations from `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi and legislation by the Universal House of Justice. Baháʼí law is presented as a set of general principles and guidelines and individuals must apply them as they best seem fit. While some of the social laws are enforced by Baháʼí institutions, the emphasis is placed on individuals following the laws based on their conscience, understanding and reasoning, and Baháʼís are expected to follow the laws for the love of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh. The laws are seen as the method of the maintenance of order and security in the world.

A few examples of laws and basic religious observances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas which are considered obligatory for Baháʼís include:
* Recite an obligatory prayer each day. There are three such prayers among which one can be chosen each day.
* Observe a Nineteen Day Fast from sunrise to sunset from March 2 through March 20. During this time Baháʼís in good health between the ages of 15 and 70 abstain from eating and drinking.
* Gossip and backbiting are prohibited and viewed as particularly damaging to the individual and their relationships.

==Buddhism==


In Buddhism, Patimokkha is a code of 227 rules and principles followed by Buddhist monks and nuns.

==Christianity==

Within the framework of Christianity, there are several possible definitions for religious law. One is the Mosaic Law (from what Christians consider to be the Old Testament), also called divine law or biblical law; the most famous example is the Ten Commandments. Another is the instructions of Jesus of Nazareth to his disciples in the Gospel (often referred to as the Law of Christ or the New Commandment or the New Covenant, in contrast to the Old Covenant). Another is the Apostolic Decree of Acts 15, which is still observed by the Greek Orthodox Church. Another is canon law in the Catholic, Anglican, and Orthodox churches.

In some Christian denominations, law is often contrasted with grace (see also Law and Gospel and Antithesis of the Law): the contrast here speaks to an attempt to gain salvation by obedience to a code of laws as opposed to seeking salvation through faith in the atonement made by Jesus on the cross. From the Gospel of John:

===Biblical/Mosaic law===
Christian views of the Old Covenant vary and are to be distinguished from Christian theology, ethics, and practice. The term &quot;Old Covenant&quot;, also referred to as the Mosaic covenant and the Law of Moses, refers to the statements or principles of religious law and religious ethics codified in the first five books or &quot;Pentateuch&quot; of the Old Testament. Views of the Old Covenant are expressed in the New Testament, such as Jesus&#x27; antitheses of the law, the circumcision controversy in Early Christianity, and the Incident at Antioch and position of Paul the Apostle and Judaism. Most Christians hold that only parts are applicable, while some Protestants have the view that none is applicable. Dual-covenant theologians have the view that only Noahide Laws apply to Gentiles. The Jewish Christianity movement is virtually extinct. According to the New Testament Christians are no longer regarded as Gentiles (Romans 8: 28–29)

===Canon law===
Canon law is the body of laws and regulations made by or adopted by ecclesiastical authority for the governance of the Christian organization and its members. It is the internal ecclesiastical law governing the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Anglican Communion of churches. The way that such church law is legislated, interpreted and at times adjudicated varies widely among these three bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a canon was initially a rule adopted by a church council (From Greek &quot;kanon&quot; / κανών, Hebrew kaneh / קנה, for rule, standard, or measure); these canons formed the foundation of canon law.

====Canons of the Apostles====
The Canons of the Apostles or &quot;Ecclesiastical Canons of the Same Holy Apostles&quot; is a collection of ancient ecclesiastical decrees (eighty-five in the Eastern, fifty in the Western Church) concerning the government and discipline of the Early Christian Church, incorporated with the Apostolic Constitutions which are part of the Ante-Nicene Fathers

====Catholic Church====
The canon law of the Catholic Church () is the system of laws and legal principles made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities of the Church to regulate its external organization and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics toward the mission of the Church. It was the first modern Western legal system and is the oldest continuously functioning legal system in the West, predating the European common law and civil law traditions. What began with rules (&quot;canons&quot;) adopted by the Apostles at the Council of Jerusalem in the 1st century has blossomed into a highly complex and original legal system encapsulating not just norms of the New Testament, but some elements of the Hebrew (Old Testament), Roman, Visigothic, Saxon, and Celtic legal traditions spanning thousands of years of human experience. while the unique traditions of Eastern Catholic canon law govern the 23 Eastern Catholic particular churches &quot;sui iuris.&quot;

Positive ecclesiastical laws derive formal authority in the case of universal laws from promulgation by the supreme legislator—the Supreme Pontiff—who possesses the totality of legislative, executive, and judicial power in his person, while particular laws derive formal authority from promulgation by a legislator inferior to the supreme legislator, whether an ordinary or a delegated legislator. The actual subject material of the canons is not just doctrinal or moral in nature, but all-encompassing of the human condition.

It has all the ordinary elements of a mature legal system: laws, courts, lawyers, judges, a fully articulated legal code for the Latin Church as well as a code for the Eastern Catholic Churches, principles of legal interpretation, and coercive penalties. It lacks civilly binding force in most secular jurisdictions. Those who are versed and skilled in canon law, and professors of canon law, are called canonists (or colloquially, canon lawyers). Canon law as a sacred science is called canonistics.
The jurisprudence of Catholic canon law is the complex of legal principles and traditions within which canon law operates, while the philosophy, theology, and fundamental theory of Catholic canon law are the areas of philosophical, theological, and legal scholarship dedicated to providing a theoretical basis for canon law as a legal system and as true law.

In the early Church, the first canons were decreed by bishops united in &quot;Ecumenical&quot; councils (the Emperor summoning all of the known world&#x27;s bishops to attend with at least the acknowledgement of the Bishop of Rome) or &quot;local&quot; councils (bishops of a region or territory). Over time, these canons were supplemented with decretals of the Bishops of Rome, which were responses to doubts or problems according to the maxim, &quot;Roma locuta est, causa finita est&quot; (&quot;Rome has spoken, case is closed&quot;).

Later, they were gathered together into collections, both unofficial and official. The first truly systematic collection was assembled by the Camaldolese monk Gratian in the 11th century, commonly known as the &quot;Decretum Gratiani&quot; (&quot;Gratian&#x27;s Decree&quot;). Pope Gregory IX is credited with promulgating the first official collection of canons called the &quot;Decretalia Gregorii Noni&quot; or &quot;Liber Extra&quot; (1234). This was followed by the &quot;Liber Sextus&quot; (1298) of Boniface VIII, the &quot;Clementines&quot; (1317) of Clement V, the &quot;Extravagantes Joannis XXII&quot; and the &quot;Extravagantes Communes&quot;, all of which followed the same structure as the Liber Extra. All these collections, with the Decretum Gratiani, are together referred to as the &quot;Corpus Juris Canonici&quot;. After the completion of the &quot;Corpus Juris Canonici&quot;, subsequent papal legislation was published in periodic volumes called &quot;Bullaria&quot;.

By the 19th century, this body of legislation included some 10,000 norms, many difficult to reconcile with one another due to changes in circumstances and practice. This situation impelled Pope Pius X to order the creation of the first Code of Canon Law, a single volume of clearly stated laws. Under the aegis of Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, the Commission for the Codification of Canon Law was completed under Benedict XV, who promulgated the Code, effective in 1918. The work having been begun by Pius X, it was sometimes called the &quot;Pio-Benedictine Code&quot; but more often the 1917 Code. In its preparation, centuries of material was examined, scrutinized for authenticity by leading experts, and harmonized as much as possible with opposing canons and even other Codes, from the Codex of Justinian to the Napoleonic Code.

Pope John XXIII initially called for a Synod of the Diocese of Rome, an Ecumenical Council, and an updating to the 1917 Code. After the Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican (Vatican II) closed in 1965, it became apparent that the Code would need to be revised in light of the documents and theology of Vatican II. After multiple drafts and many years of discussion, Pope John Paul II promulgated the revised Code of Canon Law (CIC) in 1983. Containing 1752 canons, it is the law currently binding on the Latin (Western) Roman Church.

The canon law of the Eastern Catholic Churches, which had developed some different disciplines and practices, underwent its own process of codification, resulting in the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches promulgated in 1990 by Pope John Paul II.

The institutions and practices of canon law paralleled the legal development of much of Europe, and consequently both modern Civil law and Common law bear the influences of canon law. Edson Luiz Sampel, a Brazilian expert in canon law, says that canon law is contained in the genesis of various institutes of civil law, such as the law in continental Europe and Latin American countries. Sampel explains that canon law has significant influence in contemporary society.

Currently, all Latin Catholic seminary students are expected to take a course in canon law (c. 252.3). Some ecclesiastical officials are required to have the doctorate (JCD) or at least the licentiate (JCL) in canon law in order to fulfill their functions: Judicial Vicars (c. 1419.1), Judges (c. 1421.3), Promoters of Justice (c. 1435), Defenders of the Bond (c. 1435). In addition, Vicars General and Episcopal Vicars are to be doctors or at least licensed in canon law or theology (c. 478.1), and canonical advocates must either have the doctorate or be truly expert in canon law (c. 1483). Ordinarily, bishops are to have advanced degrees in sacred scripture, theology, or canon law (c. 378.1.5). St. Raymond of Penyafort (1175–1275), a Spanish Dominican priest, is the patron saint of canonists, due to his important contributions to the science of canon law.

====Orthodox Churches====
The Greek-speaking Orthodox have collected canons and commentaries upon them in a work known as the &quot;Pēdálion&quot; (Greek: Πηδάλιον, &quot;Rudder&quot;), so named because it is meant to &quot;steer&quot; the Church. The Orthodox Christian tradition in general treats its canons more as guidelines than as laws, the bishops adjusting them to cultural and other local circumstances. Some Orthodox canon scholars point out that, had the Ecumenical Councils (which deliberated in Greek) meant for the canons to be used as laws, they would have called them &quot;nómoi/νόμοι&quot; (laws) rather than &quot;kanónes/κανόνες&quot; (rules), but almost all Orthodox conform to them. The dogmatic decisions of the Councils, though, are to be obeyed rather than to be treated as guidelines, since they are essential for the Church&#x27;s unity.

====Anglican Communion====

In the Church of England, the ecclesiastical courts that formerly decided many matters such as disputes relating to marriage, divorce, wills, and defamation, still have jurisdiction of certain church-related matters (e.g., discipline of clergy, alteration of church property, and issues related to churchyards). Their separate status dates back to the 11th century when the Normans split them off from the mixed secular/religious county and local courts used by the Saxons. In contrast to the other courts of England, the law used in ecclesiastical matters is at least partially a civil law system, not common law, although heavily governed by parliamentary statutes. Since the Reformation, ecclesiastical courts in England have been royal courts. The teaching of canon law at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge was abrogated by Henry VIII; thereafter practitioners in the ecclesiastical courts were trained in civil law, receiving a Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) degree from Oxford, or an LL.D. from Cambridge. Such lawyers (called &quot;doctors&quot; and &quot;civilians&quot;) were centred at &quot;Doctors Commons&quot;, a few streets south of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, where they monopolized probate, matrimonial, and admiralty cases until their jurisdiction was removed to the common law courts in the mid-19th century. (Admiralty law was also based on civil law instead of common law, thus was handled by the civilians too.)

Charles I repealed Canon Law in Scotland in 1638 after uprisings of Covenanters confronting the Bishops of Aberdeen following the convention at Muchalls Castle and other revolts across Scotland earlier that year.

Other churches in the Anglican Communion around the world (e.g., the Episcopal Church in the United States and the Anglican Church of Canada) still function under their own private systems of canon law.

====Presbyterian and Reformed Churches====

In Presbyterian and Reformed Churches, canon law is known as &quot;practice and procedure&quot; or &quot;church order&quot;, and includes the church&#x27;s laws respecting its government, discipline, legal practice and worship.

====Lutheranism====
The Book of Concord is the historic doctrinal statement of the Lutheran Church, consisting of ten credal documents recognized as authoritative in Lutheranism since the 16th century. However, the Book of Concord is a confessional document (stating orthodox belief) rather than a book of ecclesiastical rules or discipline, like canon law. Each Lutheran national church establishes its own system of church order and discipline, though these are not referred to as &quot;canons&quot;.

====The United Methodist Church====
The Book of Discipline contains the laws, rules, policies and guidelines for The United Methodist Church. It is revised every four years by the General Conference, the law-making body of The United Methodist Church; the last edition was published in 2016.

==Hinduism==

Hindu law, a term of colonial origin, is derived from Hindu texts such as the Vedas, Upanishads, Dharmashastras, Puranas, Itihasas, Dharmasutras, Grihya Sutras, Arthashastra and Niti Shastras.

==Islam==


&quot;Sharia&quot;, also known as Islamic law ( &quot;)&quot;, is the moral code and religious law of Islam. Sharia is derived from two primary sources, the precepts set forth in the Quran and the example set by the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the &quot;sunnah&quot;. Islamic jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;) interprets and extends the application of sharia to questions not directly addressed in the primary sources (the Quran and the sunnah) by including secondary sources. These secondary sources usually include the consensus of the sahabah (companions of the prophet) and &quot;ulama&quot; (religious scholars) embodied in &quot;ijma&quot;, as well as analogy from the Quran and &quot;sunnah&quot; through &quot;qiyas&quot;. In the Maliki school of law also, &quot;&#x27;amal ahlil madinah&quot; (the practices of the people of Medina) is also included.

Muslims believe the &quot;sharia&quot; is Allah&#x27;s law, but they differ as to what exactly it entails. Modernists, traditionalists and fundamentalists all hold different views of sharia, as do adherents to different schools of Islamic thought and scholarship. Different countries, societies and cultures have varying interpretations of sharia as well.

Sharia deals with many topics addressed by secular law, including crime, politics and economics, as well as personal matters such as sexual intercourse, hygiene, diet, prayer, inheritance and fasting. Where it has official status, sharia is applied by Islamic judges, or qadis. The imam has varying responsibilities depending on the interpretation of sharia; while the term is commonly used to refer to the leader of communal prayers, the imam may also be a scholar, religious leader, or political leader.

The reintroduction of sharia is a longstanding goal for Islamist movements in Muslim countries. Some Muslim minorities in Asia (&quot;e.g.&quot;, in India) have maintained institutional recognition of sharia to adjudicate their personal and community affairs. In Western countries, where Muslim immigration is more recent, Muslim minorities have introduced sharia family law for use in their own disputes with varying degrees of success, e.g., Britain&#x27;s Muslim Arbitration Tribunal. Attempts by Muslims to impose sharia on non-Muslims in countries with large Muslim populations have been accompanied by controversy, violence, and even warfare (cf. Second Sudanese Civil War).

==Jainism==

Jain law or Jaina law refers to the modern interpretation of ancient Jain Law that consists of rules for adoption, marriage, succession and death for the followers of Jainism.

==Judaism==
&quot;Halakha&quot; (; literally &quot;walking&quot;) is the collective body of rabbinic Jewish religious laws derived from the Written and Oral Torah, including the Mishnah, the halakhic Midrash, the Talmud, and its commentaries. After the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in the year 70 during the First Jewish-Roman War, the Oral Law was developed through intensive and expansive interpretations of the written Torah.

The &quot;halakhah&quot; has developed gradually through a variety of legal and quasi-legal mechanisms, including judicial decisions, legislative enactments, and customary law. The literature of questions to rabbis, and their considered answers, are referred to as Responsa. Over time, as practices develop, codes of Jewish law were written based on Talmudic literature and Responsa. The most influential code, the Shulchan Aruch, guides the religious practice of most Orthodox and some Conservative Jews.

According to rabbinic tradition there are 613 mitzvot in the written Torah. The &quot;mitzvot&quot; in the Torah (also called the Law of Moses) pertain to nearly every aspect of human life. Some of these laws are directed only to men or to women, some only to the ancient priestly groups (the Kohanim and Leviyim) members of the tribe of Levi, some only to farmers within the Land of Israel. Some laws are only applicable when there is a Temple in Jerusalem (see Third Temple).

<doc id="201287" wikidata="Q314784" url="?curid=201287" title="Ghazi of Iraq">
<text>Ghazi ibn Faisal () (21 March 1912 – 4 April 1939) was King of Iraq from 1933 to 1939 having been briefly Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Syria in 1920. He was born in Mecca, and was the only son of Faisal I. He died in a car accident in Baghdad in 1939, where he was succeeded by Faisal II.

==Early life==
Ghazi was the only son of the then Emir Faisal (later to become King Faisal I of Iraq) and Huzaima bint Nasser. He was born when his father was leading a campaign in &#x27;Asir against Muhammad ibn Ali al-Idrisi of &#x27;Asir; so he was named Ghazi (meaning warrior due to this campaign, In his childhood, Ghazi was left with his grandfather, Hussein bin Ali, the Hashemite Grand Sharif of Mecca and head of the royal house of Hashim, who called Ghazi &quot;Awn&quot; after his great-grandfather Awn bin Muhsin, while his father was occupied with travel and in military campaigns against the Ottomans. The Hashemites had ruled the Hijaz within the Ottoman Empire before rebelling with British assistance in the later stages of World War I. He attended Harrow School.
Unlike his worldly father, Ghazi grew up a shy and inexperienced young man. Following the defeat of his grandfather&#x27;s army by Saudi forces in 1924, he was forced to leave the Hijaz with the rest of the Hashemites. They travelled to Transjordan where Ghazi&#x27;s uncle Abdullah was Emir. In the same year, Ghazi joined his father in Baghdad and was appointed as crown prince and heir to the Kingdom of Iraq. His father had been crowned following a national referendum in 1921.

=== &quot;Flying Carpet&quot; ===
As a 16-year-old schoolboy, he met the traveler-adventurer Richard Halliburton and his pilot Moye Stephens during their round-the-world flight (shortly after Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s celebrated transatlantic flight). Ghazi was taken for his first flight by Halliburton and Stephens in their biplane, the &quot;Flying Carpet&quot;. They flew down to see the ruins of Ancient Babylon and other historical sites and flew low over the prince&#x27;s own school so that his schoolmates could see him in the biplane. An account of the young Crown Prince Ghazi&#x27;s experience flying over his country can be found in Richard Halliburton&#x27;s &quot;The Flying Carpet&quot;.

=== Simele Massacre ===
Ghazi came to Simele to award &quot;victorious&quot; colors to the military and tribal leaders who, on 11 August 1933, participated in the Simele massacre of Assyrians and the looting of their homes.

==Reign==

On 8 September 1933, King Faisal I died, and Ghazi was crowned as King Ghazi I. On the same day, Ghazi was appointed an Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Iraqi Navy, a Field Marshal in the Royal Iraqi Army, and a Marshal of the Royal Iraqi Air Force. A staunch pan-Arab nationalist, opposed to British interests in his country, Ghazi&#x27;s reign was characterised by tensions between civilians and the army, which sought control of the government. He supported General Bakr Sidqi in his coup, which replaced the civilian government with a military one. This was the first &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; to take place in the modern Arab world. He was rumoured to harbour sympathies for Nazi Germany and also put forth a claim for Kuwait to be annexed to Iraq. For this purpose, he had his own radio station in al-Zuhoor royal palace in which he promoted that claim and other radical views.

==Death==

King Ghazi died in April 1939 in an accident at the age of 27, involving a sports car that he was driving. According to the scholars Ma&#x27;ruf al-Rusafi and Safa Khulusi, a common view by many Iraqis at the time was that he was killed on the orders of Nuri al-Said, because of his plans for the unification of Iraq with Kuwait.

Faisal, Ghazi&#x27;s only son, succeeded him as King Faisal II. Because Faisal was underage, Prince Abdul Ilah served as regent until 1953.

==Marriage and children==
On 25 January 1934, King Ghazi married his first cousin, Princess Aliya bint Ali, daughter of his uncle King Ali of Hejaz, in Baghdad, Iraq. They had only one son, Faisal II, born 2 May 1935.

Faisal had a circumcision party on Thursday, 7 November 1935, in al Zuhoor Palace and Emir Abdullah I of Transjordan and his son, Prince Nayef bin Abdullah, attended the party as well as the staff of the Hashemite Family. King Ghazi then ordered the distribution of ِalms to the poor and needy, and over 50 children in an Islamic orphanage were also circumcised on the account of King Ghazi who then distributed desserts among them. King Ghazi attended a banquet in the evening of that day which was attended by the Emir Abdullah of Transjordan and his son Nayef, and Prince &#x27;Abd al-Ilah, and he invited the Prime Minister, former prime ministers, the leaders of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, and senior statesmen.

Ghazi was suspected of having an extra-marital affair with a young Iraqi servant. British sources wrote in 1938 that King Ghazi&#x27;s bad reputation was tarnished &quot;further&quot; when a &quot;Negro youth&quot;, who was employed at the palace, died by &quot;accidentally&quot; discharging his revolver when he didn&#x27;t remove it before his afternoon siesta. An official police expert ruled that the Palace&#x27;s explanation was consistent with the police examination.

The British suspected there was more to the story, in particular, that one of Queen Aliya&#x27;s &quot;adherents&quot; might have killed the boy, as the boy was suspected to be &quot;the King&#x27;s boon companion in debauchery&quot; and the Queen therefore had a &quot;deep aversion&quot; to the boy. The King was in a panic after this incident, fearing imminent assassination.

<text>Mácnas (pronounced mock-ness) is (Irish for &#x27;frolicking&#x27;) is a performance company based at the Fisheries Field in Galway, Ireland. Its public performances are noted for being &quot;pioneering, inventive and radical&quot; in style. The company has been credited with changing the nature of public entertainment in Ireland and is regarded as highly influential within the field of spectacle performance.

Founded in 1986, the company has performed in over 20 countries across the globe. Its parades have been a centre-point of Halloween, St. Patrick&#x27;s Day and formerly Galway International Arts Festival festivities in Galway city, drawing crowds of up to 50,000 people on to the city streets.

Mácnas toured alongside U2 as part of the Zoo TV Tour in 1993. The company simultaneously helped to ring in the new millennium in three cities: Galway (Eyre Square), Dublin (Merrion Square) and New York City (Times Square).

In March 2016, Mácnas performed at the opening ceremony of SXSW in Austin, Texas. In November 2017, Macnas performed as the closing act in the Land of Green Ginger programme at Hull UK City of Culture 2017.

Mácnas offices are spread across two locations in Galway city. Administration and rehearsals mainly take place in Fisheries Field. Large-scale construction primarily takes place at a warehouse in Liosban.

The Liffey Press and Macnas have published &quot;Macnas: Joyful Abandonment&quot;, a 250-page history of the company.

<doc id="201291" wikidata="Q4884844" url="?curid=201291" title="Belva Gaertner">
<text>Belva Eleanora Gaertner (née Boosinger; September 14, 1884 – May 14, 1965) was an American woman who was acquitted of murder in a 1924 trial. She inspired the character of Velma in the 1926 play &quot;Chicago&quot; created by Maurine Dallas Watkins; Watkins reported on the trial for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. The character of Velma Kelly also appears in the 1975 musical based on the play.

==Early life==
Gaertner was born Belva Eleanora Boosinger on September 14, 1884, in Litchfield, Illinois to Mary Jane (née Clark) and Charles M. Boosinger. She was a three-time divorced cabaret singer who used the professional name Belle Brown. Her first marriage was July 11, 1901 in Montgomery Co, IL to Harry W. Peepo (divorced before 1905), then to a Mr. Overbeck. In 1917, she married William Gaertner, who was 20 years older and a wealthy industrialist, in Crown Point, Indiana. Five months later, William Gaertner successfully sued to have the marriage annulled, claiming that Belva&#x27;s divorce from Overbeck had not been finalized. They then were married a second time, but had separated by the time Belva was accused of murder.

==Murder of Walter Law==
On March 11, 1924, Belva Gaertner allegedly shot and killed her lover Walter Law, a married man with one child. Law was found sprawled in the front seat of Gaertner&#x27;s car with a bottle of gin and a gun lying beside him. Gaertner, found later at her apartment with blood-soaked clothes on the floor, confessed that she was drunk and was driving with Law, but couldn&#x27;t remember what happened.

Gaertner was arrested for the murder of Law in Chicago on March 12, 1924, and admitted to drinking with Law at various bars and jazz houses, saying she carried a gun for fear of robbers.

==The trial==

One of Law&#x27;s co-workers testified that Law had confided that Gaertner was a possessive lover who had threatened him with a knife when he tried to leave her, and Law believed she would kill him one day.
Gaertner told Maurine Dallas Watkins: &quot;No woman can love a man enough to kill him. They aren&#x27;t worth it, because there are always plenty more. Walter was just a kid—29 and I&#x27;m 38. Why should I have worried whether he loved me or whether he left me? Gin and guns—either one is bad enough, but together they get you in a dickens of a mess, don&#x27;t they?&quot; Gaertner was defended by Thomas D. Nash.

Gaertner&#x27;s defense was that Law might have killed himself with the gun. She was acquitted in June 1924.

== Later life ==
In 1925, following her acquittal, she remarried William Gaertner. In 1926, Gaertner filed for divorce again, claiming she was abusive and an alcoholic. On July 5, Gaertner claimed his wife threatened to murder him after he found her with another man. She was convicted of drunk driving in November 1926.

By 1930, she and Gaertner had reconciled their marriage and moved to Europe. Following William Gaertner&#x27;s death on December 2, 1948, in Wilmette, Illinois, Belva moved to Pasadena, California and lived with her sister, Ethel Kraushaar. She died of natural causes on May 14, 1965, at the age of 80.

== Stage and screen adaptations ==
Watkins used Gaertner&#x27;s story as part of the inspiration for her play &quot;Chicago&quot;; Roxie Hart, the lead character in Chicago, is a former entertainer who blames her crime on jazz, liquor and guns (Hart&#x27;s backstory was adapted from an unrelated murder case, that of Beulah Annan). Gaertner attended the 1927 opening of &quot;Chicago&quot; in Chicago, Illinois.

The play has since been adapted into a 1927 silent film, 1975 stage musical, and 2002 movie musical (which won the Academy Award for Best Picture), all by that name, as well as the 1942 romantic comedy film &quot;Roxie Hart&quot;. The 1975 musical and its 2002 film adaptation relied on some of Gaertner&#x27;s story to flesh out the character of Velma Kelly, who in Watkins&#x27;s original play was a minor character. Her case was also covered on an episode of &quot;Deadly Women&quot; on Investigation Discovery in 2021.

<text>George Pierce Baker (April 4, 1866 – January 6, 1935) was a professor of English at Harvard and Yale and author of &quot;Dramatic Technique&quot;, a codification of the principles of drama.

==Biography==
Baker graduated in the Harvard College class of 1887, served as Editor-in-Chief of &quot;The Harvard Monthly&quot;, and taught in the English Department at Harvard from 1888 until 1924. He started his &quot;47 workshop&quot; class in playwriting in 1905. He was instrumental in creating the Harvard Theatre Collection at Harvard University Library. In 1908 he began the Harvard Dramatic Club, acting as its sponsor, and in 1912 he founded Workshop 47 to provide a forum for the performance of plays developed within his English class. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1914. Unable to persuade Harvard to offer a degree in playwriting, he moved to Yale University in 1925, where he helped found the Yale School of Drama. He remained there until his retirement in 1933.

Baker was Hyde lecturer and taught a seminar on Shakespeare and English drama at the Sorbonne University (Paris) in 1907-08. He lectured at other French universities and gave several series of lectures at Lowell Institute. He has edited books on drama and written several himself, including &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Development as a Dramatist&quot; (1907).

==Harvard&#x27;s Workshop 47==

In 1922, he was interviewed and given a cover page news story with photograph titled &quot;What&#x27;s the Matter With My Play?&quot;

Dr. Baker is quoted as beginning his lectures with &quot;No one, no system, can create a dramatist.&quot; 

Baker states when referring to Workshop 47 &quot;In 1913 the Workshop began. From the beginning it has depended almost wholly on itself, doing all the work except for the making of scenery flats and some of the bulky properties. It occupies the lower floor of Massachusetts Hall, one of the oldest of the Harvard buildings. Students are admitted in English 47 and 47A, the two courses in playwriting. These appear also in the curriculum of Radcliffe, the woman&#x27;s college. To get from the first group (47) to the second group (47A) is by competition; students in the former submitting June 1 of each year manuscripts of one act plays. Prof. Baker passes on these and forms the next year&#x27;s band of aspiring playwrights out of the winning men. And these students write the plays that are acted in the theater of Massachusetts Hall in the next term, put on the stage by the director or his aids and criticized by the classes.&quot;

Among those he taught in his playwriting Workshop 47 class were:
*George Abbott 
*Christina Hopkinson Baker
*Faith Baldwin
*Charlotte Rebecca Woglom Bangs
*Philip Barry
*Mary Porter Beegle
*S.N. Behrman

<text>Maurine Dallas Watkins (July 27, 1896 – August 10, 1969) was an American playwright and screenwriter. Early in her career, she briefly worked as a journalist covering the courthouse beat for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. This experience gave her the material for her most famous piece of work, the stage play &quot;Chicago&quot; (1926), which was eventually adapted into the 1975 Broadway musical of the same name, which was then made into a film in 2002 that won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

Watkins was born in Kentucky and grew up in Indiana. She graduated with honors from Butler University and headed to Radcliffe, where she received training as a dramatist. She left Radcliffe and was in advertising in Chicago in the early 1920s. She then landed a job as a reporter before returning to university at what became Yale Drama School and play-writing success. Watkins went on to write screenplays in Hollywood, eventually retiring to Florida.

==Early life and career==
Watkins was born in Louisville, Kentucky, or possibly Lexington, Kentucky. She was born on July 27, however, her birth certificate does not exist in Kentucky state records and several different years have been suggested. Watkins&#x27; father was a minister and she an only child. Her family moved to Crawfordsville, Indiana and at age 11 she received local notice for putting on a play she wrote, &quot;Hearts of Gold&quot;, which made $45 for charity. At Crawfordsville High School she started a newspaper and was active in clubs. She attended a total of five colleges (including Hamilton College (Kentucky), Transylvania University, Butler College (Indianapolis), and Radcliffe College). While at Butler, Watkins joined the Gamma chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta Women&#x27;s Fraternity and was initiated in 1919.

That year, she graduated first in her class from Butler, and then moved on to Radcliffe, Massachusetts to pursue graduate studies in Greek. However, her plans changed after she applied for and was accepted into English Professor George Pierce Baker&#x27;s playwriting workshop at Harvard University. Baker encouraged writing students to seek experience in the larger world and may have recommended newspaper reporting. Watkins left Radcliffe before completing a degree, moved to Chicago and first worked in advertising for Standard Oil. While working in advertising, she entertained ideas of working as a playwright. In early 1924, she instead landed a job as a reporter with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

For the &quot;Tribune&quot;, where Watkins worked for eight months, she covered the murders and the subsequent trials of Belva Gaertner, a twice-divorced cabaret singer, and Beulah Sheriff Annan. Watkins focused on the farcical, cynical, and sensational aspects of the two cases, the press and public interest, and the legal proceedings. She highlighted two attractive &quot;jazz babies&quot; claiming to have been corrupted by men and liquor. She characterized Annan as &quot;beauty of the cell block&quot; and Gaertner as &quot;most stylish of Murderess Row.&quot; She competed with other female journalists, such as Ione Quinby, for exclusive scoops on sensational crime stories. Gartner and Annan, after months of press coverage in Chicago&#x27;s seven daily papers, were found not guilty in separate trials; Watkins believed they were guilty.

Watkins published about 50 stories during her time at the paper, in addition to crime and courts, she was sent to cover funerals, wrote on women&#x27;s style, and she profiled leaders of the women&#x27;s pacifist movement. Watkins also briefly reported on the noted Leopold and Loeb kidnapping and murder case, whose sensational qualities quickly overshadowed the coverage of the Belva Gaertner verdict.

Soon after, she returned to school to study again under Baker, who had moved to Yale University, to help start the Yale School of Drama. As a class assignment in his famous &quot;47 Workshop&quot; course, she wrote a thinly fictionalized account of the two murders. She first called it &quot;The Brave Little Woman&quot;, then &quot;Chicago, or Play Ball&quot; (first copyrighted version: pre-production manuscript), and finally &quot;Chicago&quot; (second copyrighted version: post-production script). Beulah Annan became &quot;Roxie Hart&quot;; Belva Gaertner, &quot;Velma&quot;; Albert Annan, &quot;Amos Hart&quot;; and the two lawyers, William Scott Stewart and W.W. O&#x27;Brien, were combined into the composite character &quot;Billy Flynn&quot;. Watkins&#x27; rival reporters, who were far more sympathetic to the women&#x27;s causes, were parodied as &quot;Mary Sunshine,&quot; the easily manipulated reporter who later turns into Velma and Roxie&#x27;s vaudeville manager.

Director Sam Forrest was replaced by George Abbott at the request of Jeanne Eagels (Roxie Hart); but Eagels quit the show within a few days, and Francine Larrimore replaced her. &quot;Chicago&quot; opened on Broadway on 30 December 1926 (though the run is listed as 1927). The play ran for a respectable 172 performances, then toured for two years (with a then-unknown Clark Gable appearing as Amos Hart in a Los Angeles production ). A silent film version in 1927 was produced and supervised by Cecil B. DeMille and starred former Mack Sennett &quot;bathing beauty&quot; Phyllis Haver as Roxie Hart. It was adapted as &quot;Roxie Hart&quot; in 1942 with Ginger Rogers in the title role. This 1942 film version eliminated all the murderesses except the unnamed Velma Kelly, and the stage and screen musical versions eliminated Jake, Babe, and several other characters.

Watkins wrote about 20 plays, but &quot;Chicago&quot; was her most successful. She moved to Hollywood to write screenplays, including the 1936 comedy &quot;Libeled Lady&quot;. The film featured William Powell, Myrna Loy, Jean Harlow, and Spencer Tracy. Her play and screenwriting, coupled with investments, made her a millionaire, and she traveled the world.

==Later life==
Her public career ended around the time her father died in 1941. Watkins left Hollywood and moved to Florida, close to her elderly mother. She was a lifelong Christian and spent much of her fortune of over $2,300,000 founding contests and chairs in Greek and Bible studies at some 20 universities, including Princeton.

In the 1960s, Watkins was approached by Bob Fosse, who sought the rights to &quot;Chicago&quot; for a musical adaptation, but she resisted his offers. Following her death from lung cancer in 1969, C. R. Leonard, a trust officer at the Florida National Bank in Jacksonville, handled Watkins&#x27; estate and negotiated sale of rights to her play. He later stated that at the time a major heir from the playwright&#x27;s family informed him that Maurine believed that her newspaper articles had &quot;gained sympathy&quot; for Beulah Annan and that &quot;over the years [she] became disturbed that she had assisted in getting an acquittal for a murderer.&quot;

After the much delayed sale of these rights, Fosse was able to move ahead with development of &quot;Chicago: A Musical Vaudeville&quot; with a score by John Kander and Fred Ebb. It was first produced in 1975, revived in 1997, and filmed in 2002. By the time of the 50th anniversary of Watkins death, &quot;Chicago&quot; had become a $2 billion franchise.

<text>Beulah May Annan (née Sheriff; November 18, 1899 – March 10, 1928) was an American suspected murderer. Her story inspired Maurine Dallas Watkins&#x27;s play &quot;Chicago&quot; in 1926. The play was adapted into a 1927 silent film, a 1975 stage musical, and a 2002 movie musical (which won the Academy Award for Best Picture), all with that title, and a 1942 romantic comedy film, &quot;Roxie Hart&quot;, named for the character who Annan inspired.

Annan was born Beulah May Sheriff in Owensboro, Kentucky, to Mary (née Neel) and John R. Sheriff. While living in Kentucky, she married her first husband, newspaper linotype operator Perry Stephens. They soon divorced, and Beulah then met car mechanic Albert &quot;Al&quot; Annan. They went to Chicago together, where they got married on March 29, 1920.

In Chicago, Albert found work as a mechanic at a garage and Beulah eventually became a bookkeeper at Tennant&#x27;s Model Laundry. At the laundry she met Harry Kalsted [misspelled Kalstedt by the press], and the two began an affair.

==The Homicide==
On April 3, 1924, in the married couple&#x27;s bedroom, Annan shot Kalsted. According to the autopsy, the bullet passed laterally through Kalsted&#x27;s torso. The bullet&#x27;s path made it difficult to judge whether Kalsted was turned sideways to move away from Annan when she shot him or was turned sideways toward her, perhaps reaching to take the gun away from her. According to Annan&#x27;s initial story, Kalsted attempted to rape her, so she retreated to the bedroom, picked up the gun off the unmade bed (her husband being in the habit of keeping the gun under his pillow), and shot Kalsted as he came toward her. After intensive interrogation at the Hyde Park police station, she eventually admitted that she and Kalsted had been having an affair, that she invited him to bring her wine, that they &quot;had a jazz&quot; (sex) on the couch, and that they got into a heated argument over the fact that he had been lying to her and everyone else about his sordid past. At some point Kalsted &quot;jumped up,&quot; she said, and they both &quot;beat it for the bedroom,&quot; where they simultaneously reached for the gun on the bed. She got the revolver first and shot him, she explained. During this interrogation, she was never asked why she shot Kalsted or what Kalsted did just before she shot him. Hence, her answers, on which the prosecution nevertheless relied in court, did not disclose whether Kalsted was retreating when she shot him, as the prosecution claimed, or trying to take the gun from her, another plausible possibility. After wiping the fallen Kalsted&#x27;s face with a damp cloth and pushing at his eyelids to see if he was alive, Annan concluded that he was dead. The coroner&#x27;s physician subsequently confirmed that Kalsted died almost instantly, when the bullet passed through his heart. Fearing that neighbors had heard the shot, Annan put on a jazz recording of a song called &quot;Hula Lou.&quot; Some newspapers, probably inspired by misleading statements by the police, falsely claimed that she played the record over and over and danced around the apartment, while a dying Kalsted bled out on her bedroom floor. In fact, she fretted, muddled by wine and worried about the conclusions the police might draw from the circumstances. She finally called her husband at work. When he arrived home, he was the one who finally called the police.

==The trial==

In the days following her arrest, Annan repeated her statement that she got hold of the gun just before Kalsted grabbed it. At her trial, probably following direct advice or at least insinuation from her attorneys, she reverted to her claim that she hardly knew Kalsted, who wheedled his way into her apartment and then tried to rape her. Her lawyers argued that Kalsted was reaching toward her when she pulled the trigger in self-defense, which explained why the bullet traveled laterally through his torso. Prosecutors claimed that Annan shot Kalsted in a rage because he threatened to leave her. The trial ended with an acquittal, which should not have been surprising, given the ambiguity of the state&#x27;s evidence. 

Albert Annan stood by Beulah after her arrest, but there are conflicting reports about how long the relationship lasted following the trial and whether she left him or he left her.

==Later life==
In 1927, after her divorce from Annan was finalized, she married Edward Harlib, a boxer. Just three months later she claimed that he had been cruel to her and filed for divorce. In the divorce settlement, Harlib paid her $5,000 (equivalent to $,000 in current dollars). After her divorce from Harlib, Annan was involved with a fourth man, Able Marcus.

==Death==
Annan died of tuberculosis, aged 28, at the Chicago Fresh Air Sanatorium, where she was staying under the name Beulah Stephens, in 1928, four years after her acquittal on charges of murder.

She was returned to her home state for burial in Mount Pleasant Cumberland Presbyterian Church Cemetery, Daviess County, Kentucky. Her grave marker incorrectly notes her death as a year earlier, stating it to be March 10, 1927.

<text>Rudolf Karl Augstein (5 November 1923 – 7 November 2002) was a German journalist, editor, publicist, and politician. He was one of the most influential German journalists, founder and part-owner of magazine. As a politician, he was a member of the Bundestag for the Free Democratic Party of Germany (FDP) between November 1972 and January 1973.

==Life and career==
Born in Hanover, Germany, he was a radio operator and artillery observer in the &quot;Heer&quot; (the German Army) during World War II. By war&#x27;s end, he held the rank of &quot;Leutnant der Reserve&quot; (reserve officer). He founded in 1946/1947, which became (and still is) the most important investigative weekly magazine in Germany. During the &quot;Spiegel&quot; affair of 1961-62, he was arrested and jailed for 103 days, until Franz Josef Strauß was forced to resign as Minister of Defense under continuing protest from the public and the resignation of the FDP cabinet members. Augstein became a member of the West German parliament the &quot;Bundestag&quot; in 1972 for the Free Democrats for North Rhine-Westphalia, but resigned only a year later, to focus on his duties as a journalist. It has been speculated that he considered himself much more influential with his magazine than he ever was in the legislature.

An amateur historian, Augstein published several successful books, among them &quot;Preußens Friedrich und die Deutschen&quot; (1981, ), &quot;Otto von Bismarck&quot; (1990, ), and, about his lifetime opponent, &quot;Überlebensgroß Herr Strauß. Ein Spiegelbild&quot; (1983, ). During the &quot;Historikerstreit&quot; of 1986–1987, Augstein was fierce in his criticism of Ernst Nolte and Andreas Hillgruber for creating what Augstein called the &quot;New Auschwitz Lie&quot;. A controversial statement by Augstein was his description of Hillgruber as a &quot;constitutional Nazi&quot;. Augstein called for Hillgruber to be fired from his post at the University of Cologne for being a &quot;constitutional Nazi&quot;, and argued that there was no moral difference between Hillgruber and other &quot;constitutional Nazis&quot; like Hans Globke. Augstein wrote in opposition to Nolte that:Not for nothing did Nolte let us know that the annihilation of the kulaks, the peasant middle class, had taken place from 1927 to 1930, &quot;before&quot; Hitler seized power, and that the destruction of the Old Bolsheviks and countless other victims of Stalin&#x27;s insanity had happened between 1934 and 1938, &quot;before&quot; the beginning of Hitler&#x27;s war. But Stalin&#x27;s insanity was, in contrast to Hitler&#x27;s insanity, a realist&#x27;s insanity. After all this drivel comes one thing worth discussing: whether Stalin pumped up Hitler and whether Hitler pumped up Stalin. This can be discussed, but the discussion does not address the issue. It is indeed possible that Stalin was pleased by how Hitler treated his bosom buddy Ernst Röhm and the entire SA leadership in 1934. It is not possible that Hitler began his war against Poland because he felt threatened by Stalin&#x27;s regime ... One does not have to agree in everything with Konrad Adenauer. But in the light of the crass tendency to deny the co-responsibility of the Prussian-German Wehrmacht (&quot;The oath! The oath!&quot;) ones gains an understanding for the point of the view of the nonpatriot Adenauer that Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Reich&quot; was the continuation of the Prussian-German regime

Since Stefan Aust became editor-in-chief of &quot;Der Spiegel,&quot; Augstein retreated more and more to private life, although he continued to publish commentaries regularly in the magazine almost until his death. For his lifetime achievements for peace, civil liberties and freedom of the press he was honoured with the title &quot;Journalist of the century&quot; in 2000 by 101 German journalists. Augstein was among the International Press Institute&#x27;s 50 World Press Freedom Hero laureates in 2000 for his role in the &quot;Spiegel&quot; affair.

In 1983 he received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Bath. 

Augstein married five times: including Maria Carlsson, a German translator, from 1968 until their divorce in 1970. The couple had two children; Franziska Augstein and Jakob Augstein. His fifth marriage, solemnized in Tonder on 13 October 2000, was to his long-standing companion, the Hamburg art dealer Anna Maria Hürtgen.

He died on 7 November 2002 from pneumonia and was buried on the island of Sylt.
