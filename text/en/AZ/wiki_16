<text>Organisation Todt (OT; ) was a civil and military engineering organisation in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945, named for its founder, Fritz Todt, an engineer and senior member of the Nazi Party. The organisation was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in Nazi Germany and in occupied territories from France to the Soviet Union during the Second World War. The organisation became notorious for using forced labour. From 1943 until 1945 during the late phase of the Third Reich, OT administered all constructions of concentration camps to supply forced labour to industry.

==Overview==
The history of the organisation can be divided into three phases. From 1933 to 1938, before the organisation existed, Fritz Todt&#x27;s primary post was that of the General Inspector of German Roadways (&quot;Generalinspektor für das deutsche Straßenwesen&quot;) and his primary responsibility, the construction of the &quot;Autobahn&quot; network. He was able to draw on &quot;conscripted&quot; (i.e., compulsory) labour, from within Germany, through the Reich Labour Service (&quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot;, RAD).

The second period lasted from 1938, when the Organisation Todt group proper was created, until February 1942, when Todt died in an aeroplane crash. After the invasion of Poland, Todt was named the Minister for Armaments and Munitions in 1940 (&quot;Reichsminister für Bewaffnung und Munition&quot;), and the projects of the OT became almost exclusively military. The huge increase in the demand for labour created by the various military and paramilitary projects was satisfied by a series of expansions of the laws concerning compulsory service, which ultimately obligated all Germans to arbitrarily determined (i.e., effectively unlimited) compulsory labour for the state: &quot;Zwangsarbeit&quot;. From 1938 to 1940, more than 1.75 million Germans were conscripted into labour service. From 1940 to 1942, Organisation Todt began its reliance on &quot;Gastarbeitnehmer&quot; (&#x27;guest workers&#x27;), &quot;Militärinternierte&quot; (&#x27;military internees&#x27;), &quot;Zivilarbeiter&quot; (&#x27;civilian workers&#x27;), &quot;Ostarbeiter&quot; (&#x27;Eastern workers&#x27;), and &quot;Hilfswillige&quot; (&#x27;volunteer&#x27;) POW workers.

The third period lasted from 1942 until the end of the war in 1945, when Albert Speer succeeded Todt in office and the OT was absorbed into the renamed and expanded Reich Ministry of Armaments and War Production. Approximately 1.4 million labourers were in the service of the organisation. One per cent were Germans rejected from military service and 1.5% were concentration camp prisoners; the rest were prisoners of war and forced labourers from occupied countries. All were effectively treated as slaves and existed in the complete and arbitrary service of the totalitarian state. Many did not survive the work or the war.

==Autobahn construction, 1933–1938==
The autobahn concept had its beginnings in the efforts of a private consortium, the &quot;HaFraBa (Verein zur Vorbereitung der Autostraße Hansestädte-Frankfurt-Basel)&quot;, initiated during 1926 for the purpose of building a high-speed highway between northern Germany and Basel, in Switzerland. While the idea did not originate with the Nazis, Adolf Hitler issued a decree establishing a &quot;Reichsautobahnen&quot; project for an entire network of highways, issued on 27 June 1933. He made it a vastly more ambitious public project and the responsibility was given to Fritz Todt as the newly named Inspector General of German Roadways.

By 1934, Todt had succeeded in elevating his office to near cabinet rank. Todt was an extremely capable administrator, and by 1938 the organisation had built more than of the roadway. The &quot;Autobahn&quot; project became one of the show pieces of the Nazi regime. In that period, Todt had also put together the administrative framework of what would become the Organisation Todt.

Initially, the &quot;Autobahn&quot; project relied on the open labour market as a source of workers. Germany was at this time still recovering from the effects of the Great Depression and there was no shortage of available labour. As the economy recovered and the supply of labour became a more serious issue, the OT was able to draw on conscripted (i.e., compulsory) workers, from within Germany through the Reich Labour Service (RAD) from 1935. As per the law of 26 June 1935, all male Germans between the ages of 18 and 25 were required to perform six months of state service. During this period, the work was compensated, at a rate slightly greater than that of unemployment assistance. The working conditions of the labour force would change drastically for the worse over the course of the following ten years.

==Organisation &quot;Todt&quot;, 1938–1942==
The OT was not given an official name until Hitler bestowed one soon after coming to power in 1933. During 1938 Todt initiated the Organisation Todt proper as a consortium of administrative offices which Todt had established in the course of the Autobahn project, private companies as subcontractors and the primary source of technical engineering expertise, and the Labour Service as the source of manpower. He was appointed by Hitler as a plenipotentiary for labour for the second four-year plan, decreasing Göring&#x27;s role. Investment in civil engineering work was reduced greatly.

Between 1939 and 1943, in contrast to the period from 1933 to 1938, fewer than of roadway were added to the Autobahn network. Emphasis shifted to military efforts. The first major project involved the Westwall (known in English as the Siegfried Line), built opposite the French Maginot Line and serving a similar purpose. Correspondingly, Todt himself was named Reich Minister of Armaments and Munitions in 1940. In 1941, Todt and his organisation were further charged with a project even larger: construction of the Atlantic Wall, to fortify the coasts of occupied France, the occupied Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and Norway. Included with this project were fortifications on the British Channel Islands, which were occupied by Nazi Germany from 30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945. The only camps on British soil operated by the OT were on the Channel Islands; two of these OT camps were given to the management of the SS from March 1943, converting them into the Alderney concentration camps.

Fritz Todt died in an aeroplane crash on 8 February 1942, soon after a meeting with Hitler in East Prussia. Todt had become convinced that the war on the eastern front could not be won and thought himself independent enough to say as much to Hitler. As a result, some speculation exists that Todt&#x27;s death was a covert assassination, but this has never been substantiated.

==Under Albert Speer, 1942–1945==
Todt was succeeded by Albert Speer as Minister of Armaments and Munitions, and &quot;de facto&quot; manager of the Organisation Todt. Despite Todt&#x27;s death, the OT continued to exist as an engineering organisation and was given more assignments. At the beginning of 1943, in addition to its continuing work on the Atlantic Wall, the organisation also undertook the construction of launch platforms in northern France for the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket. During the summer of that year, German war efforts became increasingly defensive, and the organisation was directed to construct air-raid shelters, repair bombed buildings in German urban areas, and construct underground refineries and armaments factories, also termed Project Riese.

In 1943, the organisation was administratively incorporated into Albert Speer&#x27;s Ministry of Armaments and War Production. Speer&#x27;s concerns, in the context of an increasingly desperate Germany, in which all production had been severely affected by materials and manpower shortages and by Allied bombing, ranged over almost the whole of the German war-time economy. Speer managed to increase production significantly, at the cost of a vastly increased reliance on compulsory labour. This applied as well to the labour force of the OT.

==OT contractors==
The OT was a co-operative effort of the German government and the German construction industry; the former supplied the manpower and the material, the latter supplied the technical know-how in the form of individual contractors &quot;(OT-Firmen)&quot; with their staff and equipment. Up to about 1942, the construction companies dominated the OT, but after Speer became its director, the government&#x27;s control of the organisation increased through standardised contracts and uniform pay scales. The volunteer contracts with the OT were later augmented with compulsory contracts, forcing construction companies to work for the OT. The construction company contracted became a self-contained unit within the OT, composed of technical and administrative staff with the skill and equipment necessary to execute the construction tasks assigned to it. Smaller companies were hence combined to form an &quot;Arbeitsgemeinschaft&quot;. The organisation of OT contractors was standardised through instructions issued by &quot;Wirtschaftsgruppe Bauindustrie&quot;, the German construction industry association. Among the OT contractors were also construction companies in occupied Europe. French, Danish, and Norwegian companies contracted with German companies as sub-contractors for OT building projects.

There were several kinds of contracts between OT and OT contractors. The most important were:
*Cost reimbursement contract, where the materiel and labour was supplied by the company. It allowed a commission of 4½% as the profit of the contractor.
*Efficiency output contracts, where the materiel and labour was supplied by the OT. The profit was computed on the basis of the wages paid to the contractor&#x27;s own staff. This was the dominant type of contract from late 1942.

==Organisation==
===Central organisation===
In 1942 a centralised organisation of the OT was created when Speer became &quot;Reichsminister&quot;. A new HQ in Berlin, Amt OTZ, was created with Ministerialdirigent Franz Xaver Dorsch as chief of staff. It merged during 1944 with Amt Bau-OT to form Amt Bau-OT Zentrale directed by Speer, and with Dorsch as chief representative of Speer as a minister, and as general plenipotentiary for construction.

===Schutzkommando===
The &quot;Schutzkommando&quot; was the security guards of the OT, whose mission was to maintain discipline and order among the foreign workers, as well as guarding the OT construction camps, buildings, and other property against enemy activities and theft. During marches the SK guarded the foreign workers in order to prevent escapes; the ratio of one SK-man per twenty foreign workers was used normally.

* SK-Kameradschaft (squad of 8-12 men)
* SK-Zug (platoon of 35-60 men)
*SK-Bereitschaft (company of 120-150 men)
*SK-Abteilung (battalion); one or more per &quot;Einsatzgruppe.&quot;

Auxiliary field gendarmery&lt;br&gt;
Two special organisations existed within the SK:
* Ordnungskommando (Order Command), stationary auxiliaries to the Feldgendarmerie.
* Streifendienst (Patrol Service), mobile Auxiliaries to the Feldgendarmerie

==Auxiliary organisations==
The NSKK supplied motor vehicle transportation for the OT until 1944. The role of the NSKK began in 1938, with the &quot;NSKK-Transportbrigade Todt&quot; in charge of motor transportation for the construction of the Siegfried Line. In 1939, &quot;NSKK-Transportbrigade Speer&quot; was organised and put in charge of the motor transportation for the air base constructions under Baustab Speer within the OT. Foreign drivers were, however, recruited into the Legion Speer, since they – as aliens – could not be members of the NSKK, which was a sub-organisation of the Nazi Party. In 1942, Transportbrigade Todt, Transportbrigade Speer, and Legion Speer, was subsumed into an umbrella organisation, &quot;Transportgruppe Todt&quot;, which in 1944 was made into an organisation independent of the NSKK, the Transportkorps Speer. Inland waterways transportation was since 1937 the scope of the Transportflotte Speer, the Speer river fleet.

==Forced labour==
Organisation Todt was notorious for using forced labour. Most of the so-called &quot;volunteer&quot; Soviet POW workers were assigned to the Organisation Todt. The history of the forced labour by Nazi Germany has three main phases:

* Organisation Todt was preceded by the office of General Inspector of German Roadways (&quot;Generalinspektor für das deutsche Straßenwesen&quot;), operating between 1933 and 1938, responsible primarily for the construction of the German &quot;Autobahn&quot; network. The organisation was able to use &quot;conscripted&quot; (i.e. compulsory) labour from within Germany through the Reich Labour Service (RAD).
* The period from 1938 until 1942, after Operation Barbarossa, when the Organisation Todt proper was initiated and utilised on the Eastern front. The huge increase in the demand for labour created by the various military and paramilitary projects was satisfied by a series of expansions of the laws on compulsory service, which ultimately obligated all Germans to arbitrarily determined (i.e. effectively unlimited) compulsory labour for the state: &quot;Zwangsarbeit&quot;. From 1938 to 1940, over 1.75 million Germans were conscripted into labour service. From 1940 to 1942, Organization Todt began its reliance on Gastarbeitnehmer (guest workers), Militärinternierte (military internees), civilian workers, Eastern workers, and &quot;volunteer&quot; POW workers.
* The period from 1942 until the end of the war, with approximately 1.4 million labourers in the service of the Organisation Todt. Overall, 1% were Germans rejected from military service and 1.5% were concentration camp prisoners; the rest were prisoners of war and compulsory labourers from occupied countries. All were effectively treated as slaves and existed in the complete and arbitrary service of a totalitarian state. Many did not survive the work or the war. By the end of the war, the Reichsarbeitsdienst service for Germans had been reduced to six weeks of perfunctory military training and all available conscript German manpower diverted to military units and direct military support organisations. From the beginning of 1942 at the latest, their place was increasingly taken by prisoners of war and compulsory labourers from occupied countries. Foreign nationals and POWs were often, somewhat euphemistically, referred to as &quot;foreign workers&quot; (&quot;Fremdarbeiter&quot;). During 1943 and 1944, these were further augmented by concentration camp and other prisoners. Beginning in the autumn of 1944, between 10,000 and 20,000 half-Jews (&quot;Mischlinge&quot;) and persons related to Jews by marriage were recruited into special units.
==Personnel structure==
All members of the Organisation Todt, even forced labourers, with the exception of Jews, were regarded as &quot;Wehrmachtsgefolge&quot;, that is combatants by the law of war. Of these, only the German personnel were regarded as being Wehrmacht Auxiliaries (i.e., belonging to the &quot;Wehrmachtgefolgschaft&quot;). The &quot;Frontarbeiter&quot; (front workers) were German, Volksdeutsche, or Nordic members of the OT. They swore an oath of fidelity to Hitler, wore uniforms, and were armed. The mean age of this group was about 45–50 years. An &quot;Einssatzarbeiter&quot; was a foreign worker that swore an oath of allegiance, wore a uniform, but were not normally armed. They could not include Czechs, Poles, Jews, or Communists. At the end of the war, their designation became &quot;OT-Legionäre.&quot; &quot;OT-Eigenes Personal&quot; was the organic personnel of the OT, as opposed to the &quot;OT-Firmenangehörige,&quot; employees of the contractors working for the OT.

At wars end, all Org Todt members received blanket amnesty from the Western Allies. Many went on to serve in the post-war British and U.S. Labor Services in occupied Germany before emigrating to Britain, Australia, Canada and the United States. The U.S. Labor Service was considered the forerunner of the new German army. The Organisation Todt itself was found not guilty of war crimes at Nuremberg, although its leader Albert Speer served 20 years in Spandau Prison after admitting his crimes against humanity.

Categories
*&quot;OT-Eigenes Personal&quot; consisted of administrative, supervisory, and clerical staff, recruited through voluntary employment of German citizens, or through conscription of Germans and Volksdeutsche, as well as French citizens working for OT in France, and also included &quot;Frontarbeiter&quot; and &quot;Einsatzarbeiter.&quot; 
*&quot;OT-Firmenangehörige&quot; consisted of the German permanent employees of the contractors. as well as conscripts serving with the contracted companies. These employees received uniforms, were given a rank, and were supposed to be given a briefer period of military training. They also included &quot;Frontarbeiter&quot; and &quot;Einsatzarbeiter.&quot;
*Foreign workers, who were either Hilfswillige, East European volunteers, or forced Labourers of many nationalities.

Classification of personnel according to nationality
* Germans and Volksdeutsche. &quot;Frontarbeiter&quot; in OT uniform.
* Nordics (English, Norwegians, Swedes, Finns, Dutch, Danes, Flemings, Swiss). &quot;Frontarbeiter&quot; in OT uniform if volunteers. Civilian clothing for local workers in Scandinavia. &quot;Hilfsarbeiter&quot; if conscripted.
* Latins and Slovaks. &quot;Einsatzarbeiter&quot; or &quot;Hilfsarbeiter&quot; in local uniforms.
* Baltics and Balkans. &quot;Hilfsarbeiter&quot;.
* Russians, Poles, Czech. &quot;Hilfswilliger&quot; or &quot;Zwangsarbeiter.&quot;
* Jews. &quot;Zwangsarbeiter.&quot; 
* Stateless German Speakers. &quot;Auslander&quot;.&quot;Frontarbeiter&quot; in OT uniform.

==Ranks==
== Crimes against humanity and prosecution ==

During the construction of the Blood Road in Norway, more than 10,000 slave labourers from eastern Europe and some hundred German political prisoners were worked to death as part of the &quot;vernichtung durch arbeit&quot; (&quot;annihilation by labour&quot;). Several SS guards and local collaborators were sentenced to prison and death after the war in trials in Belgrade and Oslo. The head of the responsible OT unit for Scandinavia, Willi Henne, was extradited to the Soviet Union and served 10 years as a prisoner of war before returning to Hessen in West Germany.

While building the main military road for Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union, the so-called &quot;Durchgangsstrasse IV&quot; or Road of the SS from Lemberg to Donetsk, approximately 20,000 Jews were worked to death or shot dead in Nazi-occupied Poland. and 25,000 in German-occupied Ukraine, as well approximately 50,000 Soviet prisoners of war. The road was issued by the SS that also rented slave labour and half-free labour to OT. OT subcontracted to German building companies and German engineers oversaw work of the more than 2000 km road.

The survivor Arnold Daghani published his memoirs in 1960 in German translation, accusing companies like Dohrmann and others to have assisted SS, SD and auxiliary troops in the deliberate killing of slave workers. A two-decade-long process against the main culprits with 1,500 witnesses interviewed resulted in not a single conviction, leading Daghani to call the process &quot;merely a farce, a meaningless gesture. 
None of the OT personnel were sentenced to prison in the Nuremberg Trials or other postwar trials in Germany. Despite a British Secret Service report stating that &quot;Supervisory assignments in OT were generally reserved for Old Party Fighters, Party members with influential connections, and more recently for older SS members in rapidly increasing numbers. [...] The result is that [...] in proportion it harbours at least in its permanent administrative staff, possibly more ardent Nazis than a regular formation of the Party.

<text>Fritz Todt (; 4 September 1891 – 8 February 1942) was a German construction engineer and senior figure of the Nazi Party. He was the founder of &quot;Organisation Todt&quot; (OT), a military-engineering organisation that supplied German industry with forced labour, and served as Reich Minister for Armaments and Ammunition in Nazi Germany early in World War II, directing the entire German wartime military economy from that position.

An engineer by training, Todt served in the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; during World War I and was a recipient of the Iron Cross. He joined the Nazi Party in 1922 and the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) in 1931. Steadily rising through the ranks, Todt became Inspector General for German Roadways after Adolf Hitler came to power. In that capacity, he was responsible for the construction of the German autobahns. In 1938, he founded &quot;Organisation Todt&quot; and directed large-scale engineering projects such as the &quot;Westwall&quot; (Siegfried Line) and the Atlantic Wall. In 1940, he was appointed Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production. During World War II Todt made extensive use of forced labour, with as many as 800,000 labourers from German-occupied territories in the service of his organisation.

Todt was killed in February 1942 near Rastenburg when his aircraft crashed shortly after take-off. He was succeeded as &quot;Reichsminister&quot; and head of the OT by Albert Speer.

== Early life and education ==
Todt was born in Pforzheim in the Grand Duchy of Baden (now in Baden-Württemberg) to Emil Todt (1861–1909) and his wife, Elise, née Unterecker (1868–1935). His father owned a small ring factory.

In 1910, he volunteered for one-year military service. From 1911 to 1914, Todt studied engineering at Technical Hochschule of Munich and Karlsruhe, graduating with a Diplom degree in construction engineering from the latter.

During World War I, he served initially with the infantry and then as front line reconnaissance observer within the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; (the German Air Forces – DLSK), winning the Iron Cross. After the war he resumed his studies and graduated in 1920.

== Career ==
In 1921, he initially worked on waterpower stations for the Grün &amp; Bilfinger AG, Mannheim company and the same year for the civil engineering company where he worked until 1933. In January 1922, he joined the &quot;Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei&quot; (NSDAP), or Nazi Party. In 1931, he joined the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), which was then commanded by Ernst Röhm. He rose steadily through its ranks, attaining the rank of SA-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; in September 1938. In 1932, Todt completed his thesis at Technical Hochschule of Munich &quot;Fehlerquellen beim Bau von Landstraßendecken aus Teer und Asphalt&quot; (&quot;Sources of defects in the construction of tarmac and asphalt road surfaces&quot;) and became a Doctor of Engineering (Dr.-Ing.).

On 5 July 1933, five months after Adolf Hitler became &quot;Reichskanzler&quot;, Todt was appointed &quot;Generalinspektor für das deutsche Straßenwesen&quot; (Inspector General for German Roadways). In November, this public authority was raised to the status of a &quot;Supreme Reich Authority&quot; (&quot;Oberste Reichsbehörde&quot;) outside the hierarchy of Reich Ministries; Todt was subordinated directly to Hitler. Alan S. Milward characterized this phase as follows:
&quot;His personal views on business questions and, what was more important, the success of the motorway project kept Todt in the inner circle of the Führer. At the same time, his deliberate pose as a technical expert, as a man without interest in internal power struggles, saved him from the adversaries of the more important party leaders for a long time&quot;.
He was given the task of organizing a new construction company for the motorways (&quot;Reichsautobahnen&quot;). He edited the journal &quot;Die Strasse&quot;, which was a publication of his agency from 1934 to 1942. 
For his work on the autobahnen, Todt was recognized with the German National Prize for Art and Science by Hitler, next to Ernst Heinkel, Ferdinand Porsche and Willy Messerschmitt. Hitler donated the award during 1937, devised as a replacement for the Nobel Prize, which Hitler forbade Germans from accepting starting during 1936.

In December 1936, he became &quot;Leiter des Hauptamts für Technik in der Reichsleitung der NSDAP&quot; (Director of the Head Office for Engineering in the National Directorate of the NSDAP) and, in December 1938, &quot;Generalbevollmächtigter für die Regelung der Bauwirtschaft&quot; (General Plenipotentiary for the Regulation of the Construction Industry) in the Four Year Plan. At the beginning of World War II in Europe, he was also appointed to the rank of &quot;Generalmajor&quot; of the Luftwaffe. In May 1938, he initiated the &quot;Organisation Todt&quot; (OT), joining government firms, private companies and the &quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot; (Reich Labour Service). OT used up to 800,000 forced labourers (&quot;Zwangsarbeiter&quot;) from countries that Germany occupied during World War II. Todt was responsible for the construction of the &quot;West Wall&quot; (commonly named the &quot;Siegfried Line&quot; in English-speaking countries) to defend the &quot;Reich&quot; territory.
On 17 March 1940, Todt was appointed &quot;Reichsminister für Bewaffnung und Munition&quot; (Minister for Armaments and Munitions) which meant he managed the entire military economy.

In October 1940, Todt formed a colonial working group focused on road construction in preparation for what Nazi leaders saw as an imminent return of Germany&#x27;s African colonies. Todt wanted to use Fascist Italy&#x27;s empire as a model for the development of a Nazi colonial empire.

After the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Todt was appointed to manage the restoration of the infrastructure there. In late July 1941, he was named &quot;Generalinspekteur für Wasser und Energie&quot; (Inspector General for Water and Energy). During that year, he became increasingly distant from the commanders of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, in particular from &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring, the &quot;Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe&quot; (Commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe). After an inspection tour of the Eastern Front, Todt complained to Hitler that without better equipment and supplies for the armed forces, it would be better to end the war against the Soviet Union. Hitler rejected such an assessment and continued the offensive against the Soviets.

== Death ==
On 8 February 1942, soon after take-off from the &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot; (&quot;Wolf&#x27;s Lair&quot;) airfield near Rastenburg, in East Prussia, Todt&#x27;s Heinkel He 111 aircraft crashed and he was killed. He was buried in the Invalids&#x27; Cemetery in the Scharnhorst-Strasse in Berlin. Posthumously, he became the first recipient of the newly created &quot;Deutscher Orden&quot; (&quot;German Order&quot;).

It has been suggested that Todt had been the victim of an assassination orchestrated by Hitler, but that has never been confirmed. A possible motive for killing Todt was that he had flown to the Wolf&#x27;s Lair to recommend that Hitler sue for peace with the Soviet Union. Todt&#x27;s production figures suggested that the German economy was not able to support the defeat of Russia and, by February, it was apparent Hitler&#x27;s plan to rapidly subdue Russia in a Blitzkrieg was not succeeding.

Todt&#x27;s successor as &quot;Reichsminister&quot; was Albert Speer, whom Hitler awarded an &quot;Org.Todt&quot; ring during May 1943. Speer was supposed to be on the same plane as Todt. In his autobiography, Speer mentioned a Reich Air Ministry inquiry into the airplane accident, which he said ended with the sentence: &quot;The possibility of sabotage is ruled out. Further measures are therefore neither requisite nor intended&quot;. Speer, who was present but had declined to travel on the same flight because he had been kept up late the night before, talking with Hitler, thought that the wording was &quot;curious&quot;.

==Legacy==

On 8 February 1944, the second commemoration of Todt&#x27;s death, Hitler awarded the &quot;Dr.-Fritz-Todt-Preis&quot; as a Badge of Honor of the Nazi Party for &quot;Innovative accomplishments, which are of great importance for the Volk community because of the improvement of their weapons, ammunition and military equipment, and the saving of labor, raw materials and energy&quot;. The Badge of Honor came with a material prize and a certificate, was awarded as a medal made of gold, silver, or steel. The Golden Award of Honor was presented by Hitler in person upon proposal by the responsible Gauleiter, upon the joint proposal of Robert Ley, the director of the corresponding Deutsche Arbeitsfront and NSDAP leaders, and the director of the &quot;Main office for Technology in the NSDAP&quot;, Albert Speer.

<text>The Miramichi River is a river located in the east-central part of New Brunswick, Canada. The river drains into Miramichi Bay in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The name may have been derived from the Montagnais words &quot;Maissimeu Assi&quot; (meaning Mi&#x27;kmaq Land), and it is today the namesake of the Miramichi Herald at the Canadian Heraldic Authority.


==Geography==

The Miramichi River watershed drains a territory comprising one-quarter of New Brunswick&#x27;s territory, measuring approximately 13,000 km2 of which 300 km2 is an estuarine environment on the inner part of Miramichi Bay. The watershed roughly corresponds to Northumberland County, but also includes sections of Victoria County, Carleton County, and York County and smaller parts of Gloucester County and Sunbury County.

The Miramichi River meander length measures approximately 250 km and comprises two important branches, the Southwest Miramichi River and the Northwest Miramichi River, each having their respective tributaries. Nearly every bend in the river, from Push and Be Damned Rapids to the Turnip Patch has a distinctive name, reflecting the importance of the river to fishermen, canoeists, and lumbermen. Tides reach upriver in the Miramichi system to Sunny Corner on the Northwest Miramichi and to Renous-Quarryville on the Southwest Miramichi — a distance of approximately 70 km inland from the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The two branches combine at Newcastle where the river becomes navigable to ocean-going vessels.

The estuarine portion of the Miramichi River downriver from Newcastle in the city of Miramichi flows through a drowned river valley. Sea level rise in Miramichi Bay has flooded the mouth of the Miramichi River with saltwater. The estuary comprises the inner portion of Miramichi Bay and is protected from ocean storms in the Gulf of St. Lawrence by barrier islands. The estuary is significant in that it is a highly productive ecosystem, despite its relatively small size. The estuary receives the freshwater discharge from the Miramichi River and its tributaries, mixing with organic materials from the surrounding shorelines and the saltwater inundation from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, itself an estuary and the largest on the planet.

The estuary is a highly dynamic environment, ranging from the high outflows of freshwater during the spring freshet, to the low outflow and rising saltwater content during the summer period, to fall ocean storms and nor&#x27;easters that reshape the barrier islands and the old river channel that forms the navigation channel for ocean-going ships heading to ports at Chatham and Newcastle, to the winter covering of sea ice that encases the entire estuary. The inner bay measures only 4 m deep on average, with the navigation channel measuring only 6–10 m, resulting in significant warming of estuarine waters during the summer months. The diurnal tide cycle ranges only 1 m on average.

==Tributaries==

Important tributaries include:

==Geology==

Rising in the Silurian and Ordovician rocks of the Miramichi Highlands, an extension of the Appalachian Mountains, the tributaries of the Miramichi River flow eastward into the New Brunswick Lowland, which dominates the eastern and central part of the province along the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

Erosion has created the &quot;Miramichi River valley&quot; (also shortened to just &quot;Miramichi Valley&quot;), through which the Northwest and Southwest Miramichi rivers flow. Throughout the course of both branches to Newcastle, New Brunswick, they are framed by heavily forested low hills. The highest peaks in the Miramichi River watershed, include Big Bald Mountain and the Christmas Mountains, extending to 750 m above sea level.

Soils in the Miramichi River watershed are typically acidic with shallow topsoil, lending to poor suitability for agriculture. The shorelines of the estuarine portion of the Miramichi River exposes newer rocks belonging to the Carboniferous period and underlay the sandy topsoil, however some coastal land is low lying and suffers poor drainage. Sandstone rocks are visible along the river banks.

==Fisheries==

The Miramichi River and its tributaries originally supported one of the largest populations of Atlantic salmon (&quot;Salmo salar&quot;) in North America. The Atlantic salmon is an anadromous fish, that is, one that is hatched and grows briefly in freshwater and then migrates to salt water while immature to grow to maturity, before returning to fresh water to spawn and complete their life cycle. The Miramichi River still maintains a reasonably healthy, self-sustaining run of Atlantic salmon, as well as lesser runs of other anadromous fish such as American shad, smelt, herring and sea-run brook trout. About one-half of the sport catch of Atlantic salmon in North America are landed on the Miramichi River and its tributaries currently.

Atlantic salmon fishing is restricted to fly fishing only and all large salmon caught must be released alive to protect the spawning population. Since this fishery is highly regulated, all anglers should contact the New Brunswick Dept. of Natural Resources to obtain the specific rules and regulations for each river and tributary in the Province of New Brunswick prior to fishing, as special licences, salmon &quot;tags&quot; and permits are required, and certain sections of tributaries and the main river are closed to fishing from time to time to protect salmon brood stocks.

The annual salmon runs start in mid-June and continue through late October, when spawning commences in earnest. It is believed that distinct runs of salmon destined for specific tributaries occur at different times of the year, with those fish headed for the upper reaches of the watershed entering the river earlier than those that spawn in the lower tributaries.

Popular salmon flies on the Miramichi River include the Black Bear series, the Cosseboom series, Butterfly, Oriole, and the Blackville Special. Deerhair flies such as the &quot;Buck Bug&quot; or the &quot;Green Machine&quot; are also quite successful. Major portions of the Miramichi River salmon fishing waters are controlled by private clubs and outfitters, with &quot;public water&quot; that is available to all very limited. Further, all non-resident anglers must hire a registered guide to fish for Atlantic salmon in New Brunswick. Guides can be inquired for in the village of Doaktown and through Dept. of Natural Resources offices.

==Environmental history==
The Miramichi River has a significant environmental history which has brought negative attention to the province of New Brunswick. Known as one of the greatest salmon streams in North America, this waterway is frequented for both recreational and subsistence fishing. In the early 1950s the Miramichi area began having a spruce budworm problem which was affecting the trees purposed for the local pulp and paper industry. To combat the issue, a solution of the chemical DDT was sprayed aerially over the Miramichi area. Assuming the DDT would only harm the budworms, planes kept their spraying jets on over the entire region including over the major waterways. This chemical spraying project adversely affected the river as well as the living things within it, particularly the wild salmon. Soon after the spraying project, mass quantities of dead salmon washed up onto the riverbeds of the Miramichi River. Approximately only 1/3rd of the hatchlings and 1/6th of the already established salmon population survived. The spraying affected the salmon indirectly as well by eliminating the insect population which the fish depended on as a food source. Combating the spruce budworm problem by spraying DDT ultimately altered the entire ecosystem of the Miramichi River. This event was documented in a famous environmental text, Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, in 1962. Silent Spring had a huge influence on the 20th century environmental movement and shed light on issues in small areas such as Miramichi, New Brunswick. The emergence of the environmental movement in New Brunswick catalyzed involvement from a variety of different social groups to target the issue. Local media outlets, scientists, outdoors enthusiasts and members of the general public got involved. Eventually the federal government placed restrictions on DDT spraying in the province. This series of events ultimately demonstrated that industrial development has negative impacts on the environment.

<text>Geoffrey Keyes (October 30, 1888 – September 17, 1967) was a highly decorated senior United States Army officer who served with distinction in Sicily and Italy during World War II.

==Early life==
Keyes was born on October 30, 1888, in Fort Bayard, New Mexico, the son of Captain Alexander S. B. Keyes, a United States Army officer, and his wife, Virginia Maxwell Keyes. Like his father, Geoffrey enrolled as a cadet at the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York, on March 2, 1908, and graduated on June 12, 1913, being commissioned as a second lieutenant, into the Cavalry Branch of the United States Army. Among his fellow graduates were Charles H. Corlett, William R. Schmidt, Carlos Brewer, Robert L. Spragins, Alexander Patch, Louis A. Craig, Henry Balding Lewis, Lunsford E. Oliver, and Willis D. Crittenberger. His first assignment was with the 6th Cavalry Regiment, where he served until October 1916 and participated in the Pancho Villa Expedition.

==Military career==
Keyes&#x27; next assignment was at the USMA, where he served as an instructor of French language. He was also head football coach for one season in 1917, compiling a record of 7–1.

Keyes&#x27; interwar service included duty with the Panama Canal Division as an Assistant Chief of Staff (G-3), instructor at the USMA and the United States Army Cavalry School at Fort Riley, Kansas, and Chief of Supply of Supply Division within War Department. He attended the United States Army Command and General Staff School from August 1925 until June 1926 and the United States Army War College, which he attended from 1936 to 1937. His classmates there included Matthew Ridgway, Mark W. Clark, Edward H. Brooks, and Walter Bedell Smith, all of whom would rise to high rank in the years to follow.

===World War II===
In 1940, during World War II, Keyes was chief of staff of the 2nd Armored Division, which was then commanded by Major General George S. Patton who, like Keyes, was a fellow cavalryman who had served with distinction in World War I and had taken a significant interest in armored warfare. Patton was to think highly of Keyes, later stating that he &quot;had the best tactical mind of any officer I know.&quot;

In January 1942, a month after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and the subsequent German declaration of war on the United States, on December 11, Keyes, promoted to the one-star general officer rank of brigadier general on January 15, assumed command of Combat Command &#x27;B&#x27; (CCB) of the 3rd Armored Division. In July, now a two-star major general (having been promoted on June 22), he raised the 9th Armored Division and, in September, relinquished command of the division to Major General John W. Leonard, before going to North Africa as Deputy Commander of the I Armored Corps, commanded by Patton, which was later redesignated the Seventh United States Army for the Allied invasion of Sicily.

Keyes was originally serving as deputy commander of the Seventh Army during the campaign, once again serving under Patton, in July 1943. During Operation Husky, when Patton split the Seventh Army in half, Keyes was given command of the Provisional Corps, composed of the 2nd Armored Division, the 3rd Infantry Division and the 82nd Airborne Division, along with two United States Army Ranger battalions, and supporting units. Advancing 125 miles in five days, through difficult mountainous terrain, the corps captured most of Western Sicily, including Palermo, the Sicilian capital, along with some 53,000 Axis soldiers, mainly Italians, along with nearly 600 vehicles, in exchange for less than 300 casualties. The corps then settled down for garrison duties and the administration of western Sicily until it was disbanded on August 20, three days after the end of the campaign. For his actions in the brief Sicilian campaign Keyes was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) wrote to General George C. Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, noting that his &quot;reports on Keyes as an acting Corps Commander in the Sicilian affair was most favorable&quot;.

In September 1943 Keyes assumed command of the II Corps from Major General John P. Lucas and commanded it throughout the Italian Campaign, landing in Italy in mid-November and serving under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark&#x27;s United States Fifth Army. Clark, who was eight years younger than Keyes, had been a fellow student at the United States Army War College in the late 1930s. His first major battle was the Battle of San Pietro Infine and later, with Major General Fred L. Walker&#x27;s 36th Infantry Division under command, his corps took part in the controversial Battle of Rapido River, part of the first Battle of Monte Cassino. The corps sustained heavy losses in the battle. The corps was then involved in Operation Diadem, the fighting on the Gothic Line and the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy, which ended the fighting in Italy. Keyes was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general on 17 April 1945, three weeks before the surrender of Germany on 8 May 1945.

===Postwar===
After the war Keyes commanded the Seventh Army from 8 September 1945 until its deactivation on 31 March 1946. In December 1945 he was by his friend George S. Patton&#x27;s side when the latter died. This was followed by command of the United States Third Army, Patton&#x27;s former command, from 1946 to 1947. In 1947, Keyes was appointed United States High Commissioner on the Allied Council for Austria. He served as Director, Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG) from 1951 to 1954.

Keyes retired from the army in 1954, after 41 years of service. He died on September 17, 1967, at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C., just a few weeks short of his 79th birthday. He is interred at West Point Cemetery.

<text>The II Corps was a corps-sized formation of the United States Army that was active in both World War I and World War II. It was originally formed and fought on the Western Front during World War I and was also the first American formation of any size to see combat in North Africa or Europe during World War II.

== History ==
=== World War I ===
II Corps was organized on 24 February 1918.
Initially it consisted of the 27th, 30th, 33rd, 78th and 80th Divisions.

In June 1918, the individual divisions of II Corps, which was commanded by Major General George W. Read, were assigned to British and Australian corps for familiarization training. On 4 July, elements of the 33rd Division (Major General George Bell Jr.) took part in the Battle of Hamel, while attached to the Australian Corps. (The Australian commander, General Sir John Monash, was said to have deliberately chosen the date as a gesture and motivator to the American infantry attached to his corps.) Individual platoons, from four companies of the 131st Infantry and 132nd Infantry, were distributed among Australian battalions, to gain combat experience. This, however, occurred without official approval as there was controversy regarding the battlefield command of US troops by junior officers from other countries. Thus, while Hamel was a relatively minor battle by the standards of World War I, it was historically significant as the first major offensive operation during the war to involve US infantry, the first occasion on which US units fought alongside British Empire forces, and a demonstration that the previously inexperienced American troops could play an effective role in the war. The battle was also historically significant for the use of innovative assault tactics devised by the Australian general John Monash. As a result of Pershing&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the use of US troops the 78th, and 80th Divisions were reassigned and on 23 August 1918 the 33rd Division was moved to the Toul sector. This left just the 27th and 30th Divisions in II US Corps assigned to support the British Expeditionary Force if required. The Divisional artillery brigades of these divisions were also removed and on operations these divisions were supported by Australian or British artillery.

It first saw significant action in Europe in August 1918, in the Hundred Days Offensive, as part of the British Third Army. 
The 33rd Division was in reserve behind the British 4th Army at the opening of the August offensive. With the British III Corps attack stalling on the Chipilly Spur feature the 131st Regiment of the 33rd Division was sent to assist on 9 August, which it did with distinction. The following day the Regiment was attached to the 4th Australian Division and remained there until 12 August. From 12 August until 20 August it was combined with the 13th Australian Brigade in what was called the Liaison Force commanded by Brigadier General E A Wisdom. This was designed to hold the front from the Somme to the Bray-Sur-Somme-Corbie road to relieve the 4th Australian Division from the operation. After this it returned to the 33rd US Division.
Advances made during a secondary assault by the Australian Corps (Battle of Albert) on 21–23 August, were exploited by the Allies in the Second Battle of the Somme. This pushed the German 2nd Army back along a front line. British and US units advanced on Arras. On 29 August, Bapaume fell to the New Zealand Division and other elements of the British IV Corps. This allowed the Australian Corps to cross the Somme River on 31 August and break the German lines in the Battle of Mont St. Quentin.

During late September 1918, with two Army National Guard Divisions (27th and 30th, less their artillery) under command, II Corps was attached to the Australian Corps as part of British Fourth Army. The Corps was involved in the Battle of St Quentin Canal, during which it suffered heavy losses.
The II Corps HQ took over the front from 6 October 1918 relieving the Australian Corps. In turn it was relieved in the line on 20 October by the IX British Corps.
Its Organisation for this phase was:
27th Division,
30th Division,
301 US Tank Battalion (Mk V tanks)
Attached troops
3 Squadron Australian Flying Corps,
VII Corps RA (British),
VII Corps HA (British),
4th Tank Bde (British),
1st Tank Bn (Mark V Star),
4th Tank Bn (Mark V). 
The 301 US Tank battalion remained in support of the British 1st and 6th Divisions until 25 October.

II Corps was demobilized 1 February 1919.

===Interwar years===

====II Corps (I)====
As part of the National Defense Act of 1920, II Corps was constituted in the National on 29 July 1921, allotted to the state of New York, and assigned to the First Army. The headquarters and headquarters company (HHC) were placed on the Deferred List on 2 July 1923 and transferred to the Organized Reserve as a Deferred National Guard unit. The headquarters was initiated in late 1923 with Reserve personnel at 39 Whitehall Street, New York City, New York. HHC, II Corps was withdrawn on 15 August 1927 from the N.G. and demobilized. Concurrently, O.R. personnel were relieved from assignment.

====Army reorganization====
As part of an Army reorganization beginning in August 1927 that grouped the new XX, XXI, and XXII Corps, organized in the Regular Army, under the new Seventh Army, also a Regular formation and the successor of the old First Army, as a contingency force staffed by professional soldiers rather than reservists that could immediately take control of forces and respond to any emergency, the II Corps HHC were withdrawn from the Organized Reserve and demobilized on 15 August 1927. Concurrently, all Reserve personnel were relieved from assignment. Less than two months later, however, the Seventh Army was redesignated the new First Army, and the XX, XXI, and XXII Corps as the new I, II, and III Corps, respectively.

====II Corps (II)====

The second iteration of the II Corps was constituted in the Regular Army as HHC, XXI Corps on 15 August 1927, allotted to the Second Corps Area, and assigned to the Seventh Army. Redesignated HHC, II Corps on 13 October 1927 and concurrently assigned to the First Army. The designated headquarters location for peacetime organization purposes was New York City. On 1 October 1933, the corps headquarters was partially activated at Fort Jay, NY, with Regular Army personnel from Headquarters, Second Corps Area and Reserve personnel from the corps area at large. Though a &quot;Regular Army Inactive&quot; unit from 1933 to 1940, the corps headquarters was organized provisionally for short periods using its assigned Reserve officers and staff officers from Headquarters, Second Corps Area. These periods of provisional Active Duty were generally for CPXs and major maneuvers such as the First Army Maneuvers in 1935, 1939, and 1940. The II Corps headquarters was fully activated on 1 August 1940, less Reserve personnel, at Fort Jay, and assumed command and control of the 1st, 27th, and 44th Divisions for participation in the 1940 First Army maneuvers. After the maneuver, the 1st Division was transferred to the VI Corps, the 27th Division was transferred to the VII Corps, and the 28th and 29th Divisions were assigned to the II Corps. The corps HHC were transferred temporarily to Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, from 10 to 26 December 1940, after which they were transferred to the Pennsylvania Railroad Building, Wilmington, Delaware, arriving there on 26 December 1940. The corps participated in the Carolina Maneuvers in September–November 1941 as part of the First Army. After the maneuver, the corps headquarters began to return to Wilmington and was en route to home stations on 7 December 1941.

===World War II===
Six months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the American entry into World War II, II Corps was sent to England in June 1942, under the command of Major General Mark W. Clark. In November, now under Major General Lloyd Fredendall, II Corps landed in Oran as part of Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa. After initially making good headway against German forces during the Tunisia Campaign, II Corps was defeated by German troops under Hans-Jürgen von Arnim at the Battle of Sidi Bou Zid. II Corps was again decisively defeated in February 1943 during the Battle of Kasserine Pass by veteran troops under &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erwin Rommel. The defeats were compounded by American inexperience, poor senior leadership, and lack of armor comparable to that in the German panzer forces, as well as the highly effective German high-velocity 88 mm anti-tank guns, which were used in screening tactics to destroy American tanks lured into pursuit of German armored forces.

In March 1943, after a change of command to Major General George Patton, II Corps recovered its cohesion and fought for the rest of the Tunisia Campaign, with a stalemate at the Battle of El Guettar. II Corps held the southern flank of the British First Army during the destruction of the remaining Axis forces in North Africa. The war in North Africa ended in May 1943 with almost 250,000 Axis soldiers surrendering, to become prisoners of war.

On 10 July 1943, II Corps, commanded now by Major General Omar Bradley, took part in the amphibious invasion of Sicily (codenamed Operation Husky) under the command of the U.S. Seventh Army. It played a key role in the liberation of the western part of the island. The corps consisted of the 1st Infantry Division (United States), 3rd, 9th, and 45th Infantry Divisions. The Allied campaign in Sicily came to an end after 38 days.

Now under Major General Geoffrey Keyes, II Corps was sent to the Italian Front, arriving in mid-November as part of the U.S. Fifth Army, where it was to serve for the rest of the conflict, participating in grueling mountain warfare and often experienced fighting in terrible weather conditions. Soon after arrival, II Corps took the 3rd and 36th Infantry Divisions under command. In late January 1944 II Corps, now with the 1st Armored Division under command, took part in the Battle of Rapido River, part of the first Battle of Monte Cassino, to distract German attention away from the Anzio landings. The operation failed with heavy losses in the 36th Division. During the fourth and final battle of Cassino in May, II Corps consisted of the 85th and 88th Infantry Divisions. For the assault of the German Gothic Line, II Corps consisted of the 34th, 88th and 91st Infantry Divisions. The corps moved up the western side of Italy, and fought in the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy, where it ended up on the right flank of the Fifth Army in May 1945.

II Corps was inactivated in Austria on 10 October 1945, following Germany&#x27;s surrender.

=== Cold War ===
In March 1958, Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, became headquarters for the reactivated II Corps as the controlling headquarters for United States Army Reserve units across the northeast. It also assigned personnel to active duty during the Vietnam War when its headquarters was moved to Fort Wadsworth, New York.

===Inactivation===
The corps was inactivated on 5 June 1970.

<text>Kite is the common name for certain birds of prey in the family Accipitridae, particularly in the subfamilies Elaninae and Perninae and certain genera within Buteoninae. The term is derived from Old English (“kite; bittern”), possibly from the onomatopoeic Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;gū- &quot;, &quot;screech.&quot;

Some authors use the terms &quot;hovering kite&quot; and &quot;soaring kite&quot; to distinguish between &quot;Elanus&quot; and the milvine kites, respectively. The group may also be differentiated by size, referring to milvine kites as &quot;large kites&quot;, and elanine kites as &quot;small kites&quot;.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

===19th century===

In 1824, Vigors proposed five divisions or &quot;stirpes&quot; of the family Falconidae: Aquilina (eagles), Accipitrina (hawks), Falconina (falcons), Buteonina (buzzards) and Milvina (kites, containing two genera &quot;Elanus&quot; and &quot;Milvus&quot;). He characterized the kites as having weaker bill and feebler talons than the buzzards, tail more or less forked, and wings longer than the tail.

In &quot;Elanus&quot;, he grouped the black-winged kite (now several &quot;Elanus&quot; spp.), scissor-tailed kite (now &quot;Chelictinia&quot;), and swallow-tailed kite (now &quot;Elanoides&quot;). These species all have pointed wings with the second primary the longest. The pattern of scales on the legs (acrotarsi) is reticulated, and the toes are separated. But Vigors noted that only the black-winged kite had rounded undersides on the nails of its talons, a trait found in the osprey but not in any other raptors, and thus suggested a separation of &quot;Elanus&quot; into two sections. A year later, he established a separate genus &quot;Nauclerus&quot; for the scissor- and swallow-tailed kites.

&quot;Milvus&quot; contained the familiar red and black kites. The fourth primary feather is the longest, leg scales are scutellated, and the exterior toe is united to the middle toe by a membrane.

Vigors placed &quot;Ictinia&quot; – &quot;the &quot;Milan Cresserelle&quot; of M. Vieillot&quot; and &quot;the &quot;Mississippi Kite&quot; of Mr. Wilson&quot; – into Buteonina. Though noting that &quot;the wings are of considerable length, extending far beyond the tail, a character which has induced M. Vieillot and others to place this bird near the &quot;Kites&quot;&quot;, he wrote that the strong affinity in characteristics and manners warranted it to be placed closer to the falcons.

===20th century===

Swann&#x27;s 1922 synopsis grouped all the kites together with the &quot;cuckoo-falcons&quot; and honey buzzards into a large Milvinæ subfamily. His order was: &quot;Elanoides&quot;, &quot;Chelictinia&quot;, &quot;Milvus&quot;, &quot;Lophoictinia&quot;, &quot;Rostrhamus&quot;, &quot;Helicolestes&quot;, &quot;Chondrohierax&quot;, &quot;Odontriorchis&quot;, &quot;Gypoictinia&quot; (=&quot;Hamirostra&quot;), &quot;Elanus&quot;, &quot;Gampsonyx&quot;, &quot;Ictinia&quot;, &quot;Harpagus&quot;, &quot;Baza&quot;, &quot;Aviceda&quot;, &quot;Henicopernis&quot;, &quot;Machærhamphus&quot;, &quot;Pernis&quot;. 
In contrast, Peters grouped the large kites into subfamily Milvinae and most small kites into Elaninae, with a few small kites joining the honey-buzzards and bazas in Perninae. His arrangement of kite genera was as follows:

*Elaninae: &quot;Elanus&quot;, &quot;Chelictinia&quot;, &quot;Machaerhamphus&quot;. 
*Perninae: &quot;Elanoïdes&quot;, (&quot;Aviceda&quot;, &quot;Henicopernis&quot;, &quot;Pernis&quot;, &quot;Odontotriorchis&quot;), &quot;Chondrohierax&quot;. 
*Milvinae: &quot;Harpagus&quot;, &quot;Ictinia&quot;, &quot;Rostrhamus&quot;, &quot;Helicolestes&quot;, &quot;Milvus&quot;, &quot;Lophoictinia&quot;, &quot;Hamirostra&quot;, &quot;Haliastur&quot;.
*Polyhieracinae: &quot;Gampsonyx&quot;

The pearl kite &quot;Gampsonyx&quot; had variously been placed with the accipiters, forest-falcons, or elanine kites. It was not until the 1960s that a similar molt schedule established its affinity to &quot;Elanus&quot;.

===21st century===

By 2015, genetic research showed that many of the kite genera are related to honey-buzzards, and that the tiny bat hawk (&quot;Machaerhamphus &quot; or &quot;Macheirhamphus&quot;) is actually related to the huge harpy eagles. Several of the large kites are related more closely to the &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks (buzzards) than to the group of &quot;true&quot; kites and sea-eagles.

Boyd places the &quot;true&quot; milvine kites (&quot;Milvus&quot; and &quot;Haliastur&quot;) with the sea-eagles in tribe Milvini within Buteoninae. This results in the following arrangement (genera in parentheses are not generally called kites):
*Elaninae: &quot;Gampsonyx&quot;, &quot;Chelictinia&quot;, &quot;Elanus&quot;.
*Perninae: &quot;Chondrohierax&quot;, &quot;Leptodon&quot;, &quot;Elanoides&quot;, (&quot;Pernis&quot;), &quot;Hamirostra&quot;, &quot;Lophoictinia&quot;, (&quot;Henicopernis&quot;).
*Buteoninae
**Harpagini: &quot;Harpagus&quot;.
**Milvini: &quot;Haliastur&quot;, &quot;Milvus&quot;, (&quot;Haliaeetus&quot;, &quot;Icthyophaga&quot;).
**Buteonini: many genera, including the kites &quot;Ictinia&quot;, &quot;Rostrhamus&quot;, and &quot;Helicolestes&quot;. 
**:&quot;Ictinia&quot; is near-basal, after the Old-World genus &quot;Butastur&quot;. &quot;Rostrhamus&quot; and &quot;Helicolestes&quot; form a clade with the black-collared hawk (&quot;Busarellus&quot;) and the crane hawk (&quot;Geranospiza&quot;).

As early as 1882, Anton Reichenow had also placed Section Milvinæ alongside Section Buteoninæ in Subfamily Buteoninæ.

==In mythology==

Isis is said in ancient Egyptian mythology to have taken the form of a kite in various situations in order to resurrect the dead.

It also figures in several fables by Aesop which underline its character as a predator: The Sick Kite, The Kite and the Doves and a variant of The Crow and the Snake.

In pre-colonial Philippine mythology, the Tagalog creation myth begins with a kite, the sea, and the sky. The kite causes the sea and sky to go to war, and after the war, land is formed, allowing the kite to finally land and build a nest.

In Bushongo mythology, Chedi Bumba (third son of the god M&#x27;Bombo: the original creator of everything) in his quest to improve upon his father&#x27;s design; was only able to create the Kite.

<text>The Chester Beatty Library, now known as the Chester Beatty, is a museum and library in Dublin. It was established in Ireland in 1953, to house the collections of mining magnate, Sir Alfred Chester Beatty. The present museum, on the grounds of Dublin Castle, opened on 7 February 2000, the 125th anniversary of Beatty&#x27;s birth and was named European Museum of the Year in 2002.

The Chester Beatty is one of the premier sources for scholarship in both the Old and New Testaments and is home to one of the most significant collections of Western, Islamic and East &amp; South East Asian artefacts. The museum also offers numerous temporary exhibitions, many of which include works of art on loan from foreign institutions and collections. The museum contains a number of priceless objects, including one of the surviving volumes of the first illustrated &quot;Life of the Prophet&quot; and the &quot;Gospel of Mani&quot;, one of the last surviving Manichaean scriptures. Many manuscripts from the Medinet Madi library are currently held at the Chester Beatty Library.

==Galleries==
The museum&#x27;s collections are displayed in two galleries: &quot;Sacred Traditions&quot; and &quot;Arts of the Book&quot;. Both displays exhibit manuscripts, miniature paintings, prints, drawings, rare books and some decorative arts from the Persian, Islamic, East Asian and Western Collections. 

==Collections==
===Western Collections===
The Western Collection houses many illuminated manuscripts, rare books and Old Master prints and drawings. With biblical texts written in Armenian, Church Slavonic, Coptic, Ge’ez, Greek, Latin and Syriac, the collection&#x27;s Christian material comes from diverse cultural and geographical backgrounds. The papyrus codices in the Chester Beatty include Papyrus 45 and Papyrus 46 among others which are some of the earliest surviving Christian artefacts in the world. In addition, a significant proportion of the rare printed books and prints are also Christian in focus. The collection of papyri is one of the most extensive in the world and includes almost the entire corpus of Ancient Egyptian Love Songs.

===Islamic Collections===
The Islamic Collection is divided between the Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Qur&#x27;an and Mughal-Era Indian Collections. The Arabic texts include treatises on religion, history, jurisprudence, medicine, geography, mathematics, astronomy and linguistics. Some of the finest miniatures from imperial Mughal albums, called &quot;Muraqqa&#x27;&quot;, are housed in the Chester Beatty Library, with important paintings from the &quot;Late Shah Jahan Album&quot; and the &quot;Minto Album&quot;. The albums were the subject of an exhibition and publication by the Islamic curator, Dr Elaine Wright, &quot;Muraqqa&#x27;: Imperial Albums of the Chester Beatty Library&quot;. Often on display is the &quot;Ibn al-Bawwab&quot; Qur&#x27;an, copied by one of the greatest medieval Islamic calligraphers.

===Persian Collection===
The Persian collection contains various miniatures and manuscripts of classical Persian poets such as Ferdowsi and Nizami.

===East Asian Collections===
The East Asian Collection has one of the most extensive collections of carved snuff bottles, many of which were included in the catalogue, &quot;The Chester Beatty Library, Dublin: Chinese Snuff Bottles&quot;. It also has Japanese art, including a pair of long picture-scrolls painted in the 17th century by Kanō Sansetsu.

<doc id="200919" wikidata="Q909891" url="?curid=200919" title="Drift velocity">
<text>In physics, drift velocity is the average velocity attained by charged particles, such as electrons, in a material due to an electric field. In general, an electron in a conductor will propagate randomly at the Fermi velocity, resulting in an average velocity of zero. Applying an electric field adds to this random motion a small net flow in one direction; this is the drift.
Drift velocity is proportional to current. In a resistive material, it is also proportional to the magnitude of an external electric field. Thus Ohm&#x27;s law can be explained in terms of drift velocity. The law&#x27;s most elementary expression is:

:formula_1

where is drift velocity, is the material&#x27;s electron mobility, and is the electric field. In the MKS system, drift velocity has units of m/s, electron mobility, m2/(V·s), and electric field, V/m.

When a potential difference is applied across a conductor, free electrons gain velocity in the direction, opposite to the electric field between successive collisions (and lose velocity when traveling in the direction of the field), thus acquiring a velocity component in that direction in addition to its random thermal velocity. As a result, there is a definite small drift velocity of electrons, which is superimposed on the random motion of free electrons. Due to this drift velocity, there is a net flow of electrons opposite to the direction of the field. The drift speed of electrons is generally in the order of 10−3 meters per second whereas the thermal speed is on the order of 106 meters per second.

==Experimental measure==
The formula for evaluating the drift velocity of charge carriers in a material of constant cross-sectional area is given by:

:formula_2

where is the drift velocity of electrons, is the current density flowing through the material, is the charge-carrier number density, and is the charge on the charge-carrier.

This can also be written as:

:formula_3

But the current density and drift velocity, j and u, are in fact vectors, so this relationship is often written as:

:formula_4

where

:formula_5

is the charge density (SI unit: coulombs per cubic metre).

In terms of the basic properties of the right-cylindrical current-carrying metallic ohmic conductor, where the charge-carriers are electrons, this expression can be rewritten as:

:formula_6

where
* is again the drift velocity of the electrons, in m⋅s−1
* is the molecular mass of the metal, in kg
* is the electric conductivity of the medium at the temperature considered, in S/m.
* is the voltage applied across the conductor, in V
* is the density (mass per unit volume) of the conductor, in kg⋅m−3
* is the elementary charge, in C
* is the number of free electrons per atom
* is the length of the conductor, in m

== Numerical example ==
Electricity is most commonly conducted through copper wires. Copper has a density of and an atomic weight of , so there are . In one mole of any element, there are atoms (the Avogadro number). Therefore, in of copper, there are about atoms (). Copper has one free electron per atom, so is equal to electrons per cubic metre.

Assume a current , and a wire of diameter (radius = ). This wire has a cross sectional area of π × ()2 = = . The elementary charge of an electron is . The drift velocity therefore can be calculated:
formula_7

Dimensional analysis:
formula_8

Therefore, in this wire, the electrons are flowing at the rate of . At 60Hz alternating current, this means that, within half a cycle (1/120th sec.), on average the electrons drift less than 0.2 μm. In context, at one ampere around electrons will flow across the contact point twice per cycle. But out of around movable electrons per meter of wire, this is an insignificant fraction.

By comparison, the Fermi flow velocity of these electrons (which, at room temperature, can be thought of as their approximate velocity in the absence of electric current) is around .

<text>Heinrich Gottfried Otto Richard von Vietinghoff genannt Scheel (6 December 1887 – 23 February 1952) was a German general (&quot;Generaloberst&quot;) of the Wehrmacht during World War II. He was a recipient of the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves. Vietinghoff commanded the German troops in German-occupied Italy in 1945.

==Career==
On 24 November 1938, Vietinghoff was appointed commander of the 5th Panzer Division and took part in the invasion of Poland under Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb. He was promoted to General in June 1940 after which he led the German XLVI Panzer Corps in the invasion of Yugoslavia.

During Operation Barbarossa, his Corps was part of Army Group Centre under Field Marshal Fedor von Bock. As did all commanders of the German corps on the Eastern Front during the invasion, Vietinghoff implemented the criminal Commissar Order. Vietinghoff also later served with General Heinz Guderian in the 2nd Panzer Army.

From December 1941 to August 1943, he was Commander-in-Chief of the German Fifteenth Army in France. In Italy from August 1943 he commanded German Tenth Army, which was responsible for the delaying actions through the successive defensive lines built across Italy. Notable in this context were the defences on the Winter Line from November 1943 to May 1944 and the fighting in the autumn of 1944 on the Gothic Line. 

In October 1944, he was temporarily raised to overall command in Italy (Army Group C) when Field Marshal Albert Kesselring was seriously injured in a car crash. In January 1945, on Kesselring&#x27;s return, he left Italy to command Army Group Courland in East Prussia. When Kesselring was moved in March 1945 to command German Army Command West (&quot;OB West&quot;) in France, Vietinghoff returned as the supreme German commander in Italy.

At the end of April 1945, he made contact with the Allied forces and on 29 April, his representative General Karl Wolff signed on his behalf at the Royal Palace in Caserta the instrument of surrender on 2 May 1945 at noon. Afterwards he spent two and a half years in British captivity at Bridgend Island Farm (Special Camp XI) among high-ranking German prisoners. 

After the war Vietinghoff was a member of the expert group dealing with the question of German rearmament. In October 1950 he wrote the Himmerod memorandum, named after the Himmerod Abbey where it was written, on behalf of the Adenauer government, on West German contributions to European defence. He died on 23 February 1952 in Pfronten.

<text>The Druid Theatre Company, referred to as Druid, is an Irish theatre company, based in Galway, Ireland.

As well as touring extensively across Ireland, the company&#x27;s productions have played internationally to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the USA. Druid has been a &quot;pioneer&quot; in the development of Irish theatre and is credited (alongside Macnas and the Galway Arts Festival) with making Galway one of the primary cultural centres in Ireland.

== History ==
In 1975, the company was founded by Garry Hynes, Marie Mullen and Mick Lally—all of whom first met and worked together as members of University College Galway dramatic society, commonly known as NUIG Dramasoc. It was the first Irish professional theatre company to be established outside Dublin.

Since 1979, Druid has owned a theatre building in Galway City Centre. The former tea storehouse was originally owned by the McDonaghs, one of Galway&#x27;s wealthy merchant families. In the late 1970s, the company negotiated a peppercorn rent with the owners which enabled the company to renovate and install its own venue and rehearsal space, which the McDonagh family later donated to Druid. In 2011, following refurbishment, what was originally known as the Druid Theatre was renamed The Mick Lally Theatre in memory of Druid co-founder, the late Mick Lally. The theatre serves as a dedicated workspace for the company and has also established itself as a cultural facility for the promotion and the development of the arts in Galway. The lane on which the theatre is situated has gone by numerous names, including Red Earls&#x27; Lane, Chapel Lane, Courthouse Lane, and since 1996, Druid Lane, when Galway City Council renamed it in celebration of the company’s 21st birthday.

In 1996, Druid premiered Martin McDonagh&#x27;s debut play &quot;The Beauty Queen of Leenane&quot;, in a co-production with the Royal Court Theatre, London. Following an opening in Galway, the production played across Ireland, in London, Sydney, and New York City. During its Broadway run, the production won four Tony Awards, including Best Director for Garry Hynes—the first woman to win an award for directing in the history of the awards ceremony. In 2005, the company presented &quot;DruidSynge&quot;, a production of all six plays of John Millington Synge as a day-long theatrical event, at the Galway Arts Festival to critical acclaim. Several years later, Druid revived a trilogy of Tom Murphy&#x27;s plays (&quot;Conversations on a Homecoming&quot;, &quot;A Whistle in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Famine&quot;) entitled &quot;DruidMurphy&quot;; this production later won several &quot;Irish Times&quot; Irish Theatre Awards in 2014. Druid continued to present large-scale ensemble productions in 2015 with &quot;DruidShakespeare&quot;—William Shakespeare’s &quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot; in a new adaptation by Mark O&#x27;Rowe—which toured Ireland, the UK, and the prestigious Lincoln Center Festival.

As of 2013, a permanent Druid Ensemble existed to work alongside artistic director Garry Hynes to further the artistic programme of the company and to &quot;investigate new creative possibilities.&quot; This ensemble is composed of Marie Mullen, Marty Rea, Rory Nolan, Aaron Monaghan, Aisling O’Sullivan, Garrett Lombard and Derbhle Crotty.

==The Beauty Queen of Leenane==

Garry Hynes returned to the Druid Theatre Company as its artistic director in 1995, after stepping down from the Abbey Theatre (artistic director, 1991–1994). It was during this time that Hynes and her colleague Anne Butler read &quot;The Beauty Queen of Leenane&quot;—a script submitted by an unknown writer named Martin McDonagh. Several months later, on 1 February 1996, McDonagh&#x27;s play received its world premiere at the newly refurbished Town Hall Theatre, Galway, in a co-production between Druid and the Royal Court Theatre, London. Directed by Hynes, the cast consisted of four actors: Druid founding member Marie Mullen as Maureen Foley; Anna Manahan as her elderly mother Mag; Brian F. O&#x27;Byrne as Ray Dooley; and Tom Murphy as Pato Dooley. The response, from both audiences and critics alike, was immediate and overwhelmingly positive. As noted in the Sunday Times on 10 March 1996, &quot;The Beauty Queen of Leenane&quot; was &quot;one of the most exhilarating debuts in years&quot;.

The production then toured Ireland before transferring to the Royal Court Theatre, London, on 24 Feb 1996. Following this critically acclaimed run, the production moved to Ireland where it embarked on an extensive national tour before returning again to London&#x27;s West End where it played at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre for several months, beginning on 29 November 1996. It was later nominated at the 1996 Olivier Awards for Play of the Year. In February 1998, the production received its American off-Broadway premiere at the Linda Gross Theater, in a co-production with the Atlantic Theater Company, before it transferred to Broadway&#x27;s Walter Kerr Theatre on 23 April 1998.

Later that year, &quot;The Beauty Queen of Leenane&quot; received six nominations at the 52nd Tony Awards: Best Play, Best Direction of a Play, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, as well as two nominations for Best Supporting Actor. At the ceremony on 7 June, the production won four awards: Best Actress (Marie Mullen); Best Supporting Actress (Anna Manahan); Best Supporting Actor (Tom Murphy); and Best Director for Garry Hynes—a historical win as Hynes became the first female recipient of a Tony Award for Direction.

In addition, the original Druid Theatre production received the 1998 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play; the Drama League Award for Best Play; the Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Broadway Play; and the Lucille Lortel Awards for Outstanding Play and Outstanding Director. &quot;The Beauty Queen of Leenane&quot; has since gone on to be staged across the world in several languages, but Druid&#x27;s original version remains, for many, the definitive production.

In 2016, to mark the 20th anniversary of the iconic production, Druid revived &quot;The Beauty Queen of Leenane&quot; with Marie Mullen. Having originated the role of Maureen, Mullen now played the role of Mag. The production also starred Druid ensemble members Aisling O&#x27;Sullivan (Maureen), Marty Rea and Aaron Monaghan. At that year&#x27;s &quot;Irish Times&quot; Irish Theatre Awards, Hynes won the Award for Best Director while both Mullen and O&#x27;Sullivan received separate nominations for Best Actress.

==DruidSynge==

In the summer of 2005, Druid presented the first ever staging of John Millington Synge&#x27;s entire theatrical canon—&quot;Riders to the Sea&quot;; &quot;The Tinker&#x27;s Wedding&quot;; &quot;The Well of the Saints&quot;&#x27;; &quot;In the Shadow of the Glen&quot;; &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot;; and &quot;Deirdre of the Sorrows&quot; which was unfinished at the time of Synge&#x27;s death. Described by &quot;The Irish Times&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest achievements in the history of Irish theatre&quot;, this collective presentation of all six plays was performed as a series of double bills over two or three days.

DruidSynge premiered at the 2005 Galway Arts Festival, opening at the Town Hall Theatre on Saturday 16 July, followed by performances in Dublin&#x27;s Olympia Theatre and the Edinburgh International Festival before concluding its 2005 run with a week of performances on the Aran Island of Inis Meain in a range of locations including an open-air setting at Dun Chonchur (a large circular walled fortress).

==DruidMurphy==

Since 1980, there existed a strong working relationship between Druid and the Irish playwright Tom Murphy. In 1985, Druid presented the world premieres of &quot;Conversations on a Homecoming&quot; and &quot;Bailegangaire&quot;—considered to be two of Murphy’s greatest plays.

In November 2011, Garry Hynes announced the company’s next large-scale ensemble project would be entitled &quot;DruidMurphy&quot;—three plays by Tom Murphy presented as a trilogy. This theatrical event was co-produced by Druid, NUI Galway, the Galway Arts Festival, Lincoln Center Festival in New York City, and the Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut where the world&#x27;s largest collection of art, artifacts and printed materials relating to the Great Irish Famine resides. Although Murphy did not expressly write the plays &quot;Conversations on a Homecoming&quot; (1985), &quot;A Whistle in the Dark&quot; (1961) and &quot;Famine&quot; (1968) as a trilogy, Druid’s presentation of the three plays sought to connect them thematically in order to provide an illuminating and &quot;unflinching look at the impact of emigration on the Irish psyche over a hundred year period&quot;. As Garry Hynes noted: &quot;Murphy writes an inner history of Ireland, a nation that has now - under the pressure of a debt crisis that has become an identity crisis - come to re-examine the materials and rhetorical strategies out of which it makes itself.&quot;

&quot;DruidMurphy&quot; received its premiere at the Galway Arts Festival 2012. Following the festival, the trilogy conducted an extensive national tour of Ireland–playing in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Tuam, Dublin, Inis Mor and Inis Meain of the Aran Islands, before transferring to the Oxford Playhouse, followed by the Hampstead Theatre in London, the Lincoln Center Festival in New York City, and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. All three plays were directed by Garry Hynes with a repertoire cast consisting of sixteen actors including recurring Druid performers Marie Mullen, Aaron Monaghan, Garrett Lombard, Rory Nolan, Marty Rea, Gavin Drea, Eileen Walsh and John Olohan. Depending on the venue, the trilogy could be viewed individually over three consecutive evenings or experienced as a day-long cycle which lasted over nine hours.

The theatrical event won Best Production at the 2012 &quot;Irish Times&quot; Irish Theatre Awards and received widespread critical acclaim, being hailed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;epic theatre making&quot;. &quot;DruidMurphy&quot; dominated the acting categories with a further six nominations. Marty Rea, Gavin Drea and Eileen Walsh were nominated for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Best Actress respectively for their performances in A Whistle in the Dark. Garrett Lombard, Aaron Monaghan and Marie Mullen received nominations for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively.

==DruidShakespeare==

In 2014, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Druid Theatre Company’s founding, Garry Hynes announced her intention direct four of William Shakespeare’s history plays, often referred to collectively as The Henriad: &quot;Richard II&quot;; &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;; &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;; and &quot;Henry V&quot;. To adapt these history plays, Hynes approached the Irish writer Mark O&#x27;Rowe whom she had previously worked with when directing the world premiere of his play &quot;Crestfall&quot; at the Gate Theatre in 2003.

At the March 2015 press launch for &quot;DruidShakespeare&quot;, Hynes voiced her opinion that &quot;acting is, first and foremost, an act of imagination. That imagination transcends nationality, character, geography, background; and we see no reason why it shouldn’t transcend gender either.&quot; With Druid’s decision to utilise gender-blind casting, the roles of King Richard II, King Henry IV and Hal/King Henry V were performed by one male actor and two female actors: Druid Ensemble members Marty Rea, Derbhle Crotty and Aisling O’Sullivan respectively.

&quot;DruidShakespeare&quot; premiered at Druid’s own Mick Lally Theatre, rather than Galway’s Town Hall Theatre—a first for Druid’s major productions. Described as an &quot;enthralling marathon production&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the production ran for over six hours and was viewed as either a day-long presentation or divided into two halves across consecutive evenings, with an ensemble of thirteen actors—consisting of primarily Druid recurring performers—playing more than fifty characters across the four plays. It later toured across Ireland before transferring to the Gerald W. Lynch Theatre in New York City, after which it returned to Ireland where it played as the closing production for the Kilkenny Arts Festival 2015.

The production was critically acclaimed, with Peter Crawley of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; stating that &quot;[t]here is nothing quite as beautiful, or as torturous, as the crown of England we see in Druid’s remarkable staging&quot;. &quot;DruidShakespeare&quot; dominated &quot;The Irish Times&quot; Irish Theatre Awards 2015 where it won Best Production, Best Director, Best Actress (Derbhle Crotty), Best Actor (Marty Rea), Best Costume Design while also acquiring nominations for Best Actress (Aisling O’Sullivan), Best Supporting Actor (Rory Nolan), Best Set Design, Best Sound Design, and a Judge’s Special Award nomination for the way in which the company had assembled and enabled a group of actors to work as a true ensemble, &quot;the pinnacle of this rare achievement being &quot;DruidShakespeare&quot;.&quot;

Druid presented &quot;DruidShakespeare: Richard III&quot; in 2018, a follow-up to their Henriad Cycle which was co-produced with the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. It premiered on 22 September at the Town Hall Theatre, Galway before moving to the Abbey Theatre where it ran from 3–27 October. In January 2019, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; Irish Theatre Awards shortlist announced that the Druid production of &quot;Richard III&quot; had been recognised for Best Production, Best Director (Garry Hynes), Best Actor (Aaron Monaghan), Best Set Design, and Best Costume Design. The winners will be announced on 31 March.

<doc id="200924" wikidata="Q5888964" url="?curid=200924" title="Home education in the United Kingdom">
<text>Home education in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is often termed &quot;elective home education&quot; (&quot;EHE&quot;) to signify the independent nature of practice from state provisions such as education for children with ill-health provided by the local authority in the family home. EHE is a collective term used in the UK to describe education provided other than through the schooling system. Parents have a duty to ensure their children are educated but the education legislation in England and Wales does not differentiate between school attendance or education otherwise than at school. Scots education legislation on the other hand differentiates between public (state) school provision and education &quot;by other means&quot;, which includes both private schooling and home education. The numbers of families retaining direct responsibility for the education of their children has steadily increased since the late 1970s. This increase has coincided with the formation of support groups such as Education Otherwise. Home education may involve an informal style of education described as unschooling, informal learning, natural or autonomous learning. Others prefer to retain a structured school at home approach sometimes referred to as homeschooling (a term more popular in the US) although the terms are often interchanged.

In 2016/17, 48,000 children were being homeschooled in the United Kingdom, up from 34,000 in 2014/15. This number rose to 57,132 in 2018. The number of homeschoolers in the United Kingdom rose by 130 per cent between 2013 and 2018, with the increase varying widely between communities. The Department for Education estimated that in summer 2023 some 97,600 children were being homeschooled.

== England and Wales ==

===History===
With the Elementary Education Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 75) came attempts to formalise and regulate what had been an ad-hoc schooling system. Campaigners to establish a school system such as the National Education League had argued that schools were for children &quot;not otherwise receiving education&quot; and the 1870 act specified &quot;a reasonable excuse for non-attendance at school : 1. That the child is under efficient instruction in some other manner&quot;.

In England and Wales, the law states that all children between the ages of 5 and 16 must receive a full-time suitable education as per their age, ability and aptitude and any special needs they may have must be met, either by regular attendance at school or otherwise.

With the growth of the schooling system came fresh theories and philosophies of education such as those of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi who would influence the likes of Herbert Spencer who in his essays on education (1854 and 1859) argued against the traditional authoritative classical form of education that disregarded the natural wishes, tendencies, and motives of the child. In turn there were many further pioneers such as Charlotte Mason, Caroline Southwood Hill and Susan Sutherland Isaacs.

Correspondence colleges, latterly online course providers began to make an appearance with Wolsey Hall, Oxford established in 1894 being the oldest.

The twentieth century saw the opening of schools such as Summerhill and Dartington and the establishment of The Peckham Experiment. The government had set up consultative committees chaired by William Henry Hadow. The Hadow reports (1923–1933) with their suggestions such that &quot;a good school &#x27;is not a place of compulsory instruction, but a community of old and young, engaged in learning by cooperative experiment&#x27;. laid the foundations for the Education Act 1944 which required that each child be educated according to their individual aptitude and ability either at school or otherwise. The plans for a liberal communal based education system incorporating schools, village halls and community centres floundered against local bureaucracy and finance and offered little more than a tripartite school system which itself would be abandoned as ineffectual in favour of comprehensive schools later to be dismissed as &quot;bog standard&quot;.

During the early 1950s Joy Baker became one of the first parents to abandon the school based education system in favour of the otherwise path. She would spend ten years battling with the authorities who insisted her children should attend school. During the early 1970s Dartington school ran a scheme, known as The Terrace, with Yorkshire County Council overseen by Alec Clegg to provide education to pupils who were required to stay on at school due to the raising of the leaving age. The scheme was run by Dick Kitto who had been working at Dartington. Kitto set up an informal democratic system and was impressed by how well the pupils responded to such opportunities. Kitto planned to expand his ideas to cover more schools but he discovered that some parents had already moved beyond his ideas and had decided to abandon schooling for their children altogether. A meeting for these families was organised in the late 70&#x27;s/early eighties (check date) which would lead to the establishment of Education Otherwise. The meeting included Iris and Geoff Harrison whose fight with the authorities to home educate their five dyslexic children was widely publicised in the media at that time. Education Otherwise is now a charity and organisation that helps families and children with queries relating to home education and resource-related issues. Other organisations such as AHED also exist.

====Badman Review====

In 2009, Ed Balls, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, commissioned Graham Badman, the former Director of Children&#x27;s Services at Kent County Council, to review current practice of local authorities in relation to home educators, and to investigate if home education was used as a cover for some forms of child abuse.

When published in June 2009, the response was mixed. Balls himself accepted much of the review&#x27;s recommendations in relation to safeguarding, however many home educators were extremely angry at the recommendation to force all to register. The Children, Schools and Families Select Committee announced its own inquiry into the handling of the Badman Review. It criticised both the Department and the Badman Review and made a number of recommendations against the thrust of the original report.

Although the Department framed legislation to implement much of the review, due to a lack of cross-party support and intense campaigning by home education advocacy groups it was dropped by the Labour administration in the run-up to the 2010 General Election.

==Roles and responsibilities of parents and local authorities==
The government recognises that education is a fundamental right for every child and that parents have the right to choose to educate their child at home rather than at school. The roles and responsibilities of parents and local authorities in this regard are covered by a document called Elective Home Education: Guidelines For Local Authorities and is published by the Department for Education. These guidelines have statutory standing and following these guidelines is obligatory on local authorities.

The guidelines quote section 7 of The Education Act 1996:

&quot;The parent of every child of compulsory school age shall cause him to receive efficient full-time education suitable
(a) to his age, ability and aptitude, and
(b) to any special educational needs he may have, 
either by regular attendance at school or otherwise.&quot;

The mention of &quot;otherwise&quot; is what covers education outside of state schools, including home education. The guidelines go on to explain that an efficient education is one that achieves what it sets out to achieve. It needs to prepare the child for adult life in the community of which the child is a member, as well as beyond should they wish to leave the community. Emphasis was formerly placed (section 2.3) on the fact that the education did not need to prepare the child for life in the country as a whole but for life in the community of which the child is a member.

There is no definition of what constitutes a full-time education, but the guidelines accept that education at home may not follow the rigid hours of the school structure and it is difficult to impossible to measure exact hours devoted to it.

Home educating parents are not required to teach the National Curriculum; provide a broad and balanced education; have a timetable; have premises equipped to any particular standard; set hours during which education will take place; have any specific qualifications; make detailed plans in advance; observe school hours, days or terms; give formal lessons; mark work done by their child; formally assess progress or set development objectives; reproduce school type peer group socialisation or match school-based, age-specific standards (section 3.13).

Local authorities have no duty to monitor the quality of home education (section 2.7), have no right to enter the homes of home educators or otherwise see children for the purpose of monitoring their education (section 2.14 - 2.16) and are required to leave home educators to just get on with the job (various sections) unless the LA already has information that the parents are not delivering a suitable education (section 3.4).

Except where the child is registered at a school for children with special needs no permission is required from the school or local authority to deregister the child (section 2.4). Parents can deregister a child from the school system by the simple means of notifying the school in writing (section 3.8). There is no action, notification or deregistration process for those children who have never been to school. When a child reaches the age of five parents can choose to register the child at a school or continue to educate the child at home as they have been doing since the child&#x27;s birth.

==Regulation and monitoring==
The law on education otherwise i.e. outside of school, taken together with the &quot;Elective Home Education: Guidelines For Local Authorities&quot; gives local authorities no responsibility, rights or control over home educators. Local authorities cannot require home educators to register, cannot demand regular inspection of the provision or access to the children and cannot seek to control or approve the education provided by parents at home. The only exceptions to some of the above are certain cases of children with special needs where the local authority is charged with providing support.

While local authorities have very little authority over home educators they do have a responsibility to identify children in their locality who are not receiving an education. Many local authorities find this a frustrating conflict and have often complained about their lack of power over home educators. They have done so in their feedback to the Graham Badman review of home education, in their submissions to the All Party Parliamentary Group for Home Education and in other surveys and inquiries. Many claim that unless they can require all home educators to register, and regularly inspect the provision of every home educator, they are unable to effectively deliver on the identification of children not receiving an adequate education. Local authorities sometimes attempt to circumvent the law and force compulsory registration on to home educators and/or otherwise deprive home educators of their legal rights under the pretext of identifying children missing education, according to the Education Select Committee&#x27;s Fifth Report to Parliament. On numerous occasions, as with Kent County Council, home educators have had to fight back to avoid local authority interference.

Home educators respond to local authority frustrations on identifying children missing an education by pointing to the fact that the law and guidelines give local authorities the option to intervene only when it has already come to the attention of the local authority that a child is not receiving an adequate education, that it was not the intention of the legislators to give local authorities the power to go on &quot;fishing trips&quot; that would impose on all home educators, that any regime of regular inspection of home educators would be hugely expensive while delivering very little value and that local authorities would achieve far more using their resources to improve schools that are not delivering an adequate education. Further, as local authority funding is related to the number of children in school local authorities have a perverse incentive to force home educated children into schools. That local authorities often act outside the law when dealing with home educators and given that the &quot;large majority&quot; of local authorities (all except 30) provide misleading information on their websites in relation to home education (page 23 of The Education Committee&#x27;s report to Parliament), home educators remain wary of and opposed to any additional powers being awarded to local authorities who many see as anti-home education.

As of March 2023, there are legislative proposals by both Labour and Conservative MPs for a national homeschooling register in order to better understand the exact numbers of homeschooled children as well as to tackle the growing problem of persistent absence from schools. The legislation would require local councils to keep an up-to-date record of all homeschooled pupils.

==Qualifications, higher education, college==
Just as school is not compulsory, exams and qualifications are not compulsory either. Home educated children often go directly into higher education or vocational courses without first passing through GCSEs and A levels. However, many institutions require proof of secondary level or pre-university level qualifications before admitting a student or providing employment. To meet those requirements home educated children take GCSE or iGCSE exams privately. This option is also available for A levels. While some GCSE subjects require &quot;controlled assessment&quot; at a school, others do not. There is no controlled assessment for iGCSE or A level qualifications.

==Organisations and events==

Across the UK, including in Scotland and Northern Ireland, local groups of home educating parents run regular meets, events, trips, picnics and camps. At the national level there are organisations and charities such as Education Otherwise and the Schoolhouse Home Education Association advising on matters related to home education.

There are other meets such as the annual AEFES (Alternative Education Festival) which is based in East Sussex UK and is organised by HE children and families. There is also HEFF (Home Educating Families Festival).

===Scotland===

The situation in Scotland is slightly different in that if a child is already in school the parent needs to get permission from the local authority to deregister the child, which permission should be granted fairly quickly. No such permission is needed if the child has never attended school. Home education in Scotland is governed by the Scottish Government&#x27;s Statutory Guidance.

===Northern Ireland===

Elective Home Education is legal in Northern Ireland under Section 45 of the Education and Libraries Northern Ireland Order 1986 SI 1986/594 which models English legislation in requiring the education of children of school age &quot;by regular attendance at school or otherwise.&quot; There are approximately 500-1000 home educated children in Northern Ireland, but exact numbers are difficult to determine due to the lack of registration. Currently there is no legal requirement for parents to register their children with the Education Board, but a consultation by the Department of Education that started in April 2014 has proposed mandatory registration, home visits, inspection of premises &amp; approval of curriculum. This draft policy by the Department of Education has alarmed home educators by requiring what the law does not, therefore creating the potential for confusion. The consultation is due to end on 27 June 2014. The largest Home Education group in Northern Ireland, HEDNI is actively involved in opposing this change in policy.

<text>The Honguedo Strait (French: Détroit d&#x27;Honguedo), the toponym designates the wide passage of the Gulf of St. Lawrence between the Gaspésie peninsula and Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada.

==Toponymy==
The name Honguedo first appeared in the reports of Jacques Cartier of 1535–1536. In the 16th century, it was known as the Saint-Pierre Strait, especially on maps by Gerardus Mercator (1569) and Cornelius Wytfliet (1597).

Only by the 20th century, Honguedo came into use, and in 1934, the Geographic Board of Quebec officially adopted it to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Jacques Cartier&#x27;s arrival in North America. Yet, the origin of the name is uncertain; it may derive from the Mi&#x27;kmaq word for &quot;gathering place&quot;, or from the Iroquois word &quot;hehonguesto&quot;, meaning &quot;one&#x27;s own nose&quot;.

==Western Honguedo Strait Coral Conservation Area==
With an area of 496 km2, the Western Honguedo Strait Coral Conservation Area is home to species of corals and sea pens that create structures that provide a diverse habitat for many marine species.

<text>The AN/USQ-20, or CP-642 or Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS), was designed as a more reliable replacement for the Seymour Cray-designed AN/USQ-17 with the same instruction set. The first batch of 17 computers were delivered to the Navy starting in early 1961. 

A version of the AN/USQ-20 for use by the other military services and NASA was designated the UNIVAC 1206. Another version, designated the G-40, replaced the vacuum tube UNIVAC 1104 in the BOMARC Missile Program.

== Technical ==
The machine was the size and shape of an old-fashioned double-door refrigerator, about six feet tall (roughly 1.80 meters).

Instructions were represented as 30-bit words in the following format:
 f 6 bits function code 
 j 3 bits jump condition designator 
 k 3 bits partial word designator 
 b 3 bits which index register to use 
 y 15 bits operand address in memory

Numbers were represented as 30-bit words. This allowed for five 6-bit alphanumeric characters per word.

The main memory was 32,768 words of core memory.

The available processor registers were:
*One 30-bit arithmetic (A) register.
*A contiguous 30-bit Q register (total of 60 bits for the result of multiplication or the dividend in division).
*Seven 15-bit index (B) registers (note: register B0 is always zero).

<text>The red kite (Milvus milvus) is a medium-large bird of prey in the family Accipitridae, which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as eagles, buzzards, and harriers. The species currently breeds only in Europe, though it formerly also bred in west Asia and northwest Africa. Historically, it was only resident in the milder parts of its range in western Europe and northwestern Africa, whereas all or most red kites in northern mainland Europe wintered to the south and west, some also reaching western Asia, but an increasing number of northern birds now remain in that region year-round. Vagrants have reached north to Finland and south to Israel, Libya and Gambia.

==Taxonomy==
The red kite was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Falco milvus&quot;. The word &quot;milvus&quot; was the Latin name for the bird. In 1799 the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède moved the species to the genus &quot;Milvus&quot; creating the tautonym.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;M. m. milvus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Europe and Northwest Africa to the Middle East
* &quot;M. m. fasciicauda&quot; Hartert, 1914 – the Cape Verde Islands

The subspecies &quot;M. m. fasciicauda&quot; is almost certainly extinct.

The genus &quot;Milvus&quot; contains two other species: the black kite (&quot;M. migrans&quot;) and the yellow-billed kite (&quot;M. aegyptius&quot;). The red kite has been known to successfully hybridize with the black kite in captivity where both species were kept together, and in the wild on the Cape Verde Islands and infrequently in other places. The red kites on the Cape Verde Islands are (or rather were) quite distinct in morphology, being somewhat intermediate with black kites. The question whether the Cape Verde kite should be considered a distinct species (&quot;Milvus fasciicauda&quot;) or a red kite subspecies has not been settled. A mitochondrial DNA study on museum specimens suggested that Cape Verde birds did not form a monophyletic lineage among or next to red kites. This interpretation is problematic: mtDNA analysis is susceptible to hybridization events, the evolutionary history of the Cape Verde population is not known, and the genetic relationship of red kites is confusing, with geographical proximity being no indicator of genetic relatedness and the overall genetic similarity high, perhaps indicating a relict species. Given the morphological distinctness of the Cape Verde birds and that the Cape Verde population was isolated from other populations of red kites, it cannot be conclusively resolved as to whether the Cape Verde population was not a distinct subspecies (as &quot;M. migrans fasciicauda&quot;) or even a species that frequently absorbed stragglers from the migrating European populations into its gene pool. The Cape Verde population became effectively extinct since 2000, all surviving birds being hybrids with black kites.

The English word &quot;kite&quot; is from the Old English &quot;cyta&quot; which is of unknown origin. A kite is mentioned by Geoffrey Chaucer in his &quot;Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;. The early 15th century Hengwrt manuscript contains the lines: &quot;Ther cam a kyte, whil þt they were so wrothe That bar awey the boon bitwix hem bothe.&quot; The first recorded use of the word &quot;kite&quot; for a toy that is attached to a length of string and flown in the air dates from the 17th century.

==Description==

Red kites are long with a wingspan; males weigh , and females . It is an elegant bird, soaring on long wings held at a dihedral, and long forked tail, twisting as it changes direction. The body, upper tail and wing coverts are rufous. The white primary flight feathers contrast with the black wing tips and dark secondaries. Apart from the weight difference, the sexes are similar, but juveniles have a buff breast and belly. Its call is a thin piping sound, similar to but less mewling than the common buzzard. There is a rare white leucistic form accounting for approximately 1% of hatchlings in the Welsh population, but this variation confers a disadvantage in the survival stakes.

===Differences between adults and juveniles===
Adults differ from juveniles in a number of characteristics:
* Adults are overall more deeply rufous, compared with the more washed out colour of juveniles;
* Adults have black breast-streaks whereas on juveniles these are pale;
* Juveniles have a less deeply forked tail, with a dark subterminal band;
* Juveniles have pale tips to all of the greater-coverts (secondary and primary) on both the upper- and under-wings, forming a long narrow pale line; adults have pale fringes to upperwing secondary-coverts only.
These differences hold throughout most of the first year of a bird&#x27;s life.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
Usually red kites first breed when they are two years old, although exceptionally they can successfully breed when they are only one year old. They are monogamous and the pair-bond in populations is probably maintained during the winter, particularly when the pair remain on their breeding territory. For migrant populations the fidelity to a particular nesting site means that the pair-bond is likely to be renewed each breeding season. The nest is normally placed in a fork of a large hardwood tree at a height of between above the ground. A pair will sometimes use a nest from the previous year and can occasionally occupy an old nest of the common buzzard. The nest is built by both sexes. The male brings dead twigs in length which are placed by the female. The nest is lined with grass and sometimes also with sheep&#x27;s wool. Unlike the black kite, no greenery is added to the nest. Both sexes continue to add material to the nest during the incubation and nestling periods. Nests vary greatly in size and can become large when the same nest is occupied for several seasons.

The eggs are laid at three-day intervals. The clutch is usually between one and three eggs but four and even five eggs have occasionally been recorded. The eggs are non-glossy with a white ground and red-brown spots. The average size is with a calculated weight of . In Britain and central Europe, laying begins at the end of March but in the Mediterranean area laying begins in early March. The eggs are mainly incubated by the female, but the male will relieve her for short periods while she feeds. The male will also bring food for the female. Incubation starts as soon as the first egg is laid. Each egg hatches after 31 to 32 days but as they hatch asynchronously a clutch of three eggs requires 38 days of incubation. The chicks are cared for by both parents. The female them for the first 14 days while the male brings food to the nest which the female feeds to the chicks. Later both parents bring items of food which are placed in the nest to allow the chicks to feed themselves. The nestlings begin climbing onto branches around their nest from 45 days but they rarely before 48–50 days and sometimes not until they are 60–70 days of age. The young spend a further 15–20 days in the neighbourhood of the nest being fed by their parents. Only a single brood is raised each year but if the eggs are lost the female will relay.

The maximum age recorded is 25 years and 8 months for a ringed bird in Germany. The BTO longevity record for Britain and Ireland is also 25 years and 8 months for a bird found dead in Buckinghamshire in 2018. In 2023, one of the first red kites reintroduced to the UK was found injured in Oxfordshire and later died, aged 29.

===Food and feeding===

The red kites are generalist scavengers and predators. Their diet consists mainly of carrions of large domestic animals such as sheep and pigs, roadkills, and shored fish. They also take small mammals such as mice, voles, shrews, stoats, young hares and rabbits. Live birds are also taken, especially young or wounded, such as crows, doves, starlings, thrushes, larks, gulls, and waterfowls. Occasionally reptiles and amphibians are taken and invertebrates such as earthworms form an important part of the diet, especially in spring. In some parts of the United Kingdom, red kites are also deliberately fed in domestic gardens, explaining the presence of red kites in urban areas. Here, up to 5% of householders have provided supplementary food for red kites, with chicken the predominant meat provided.

As scavengers, red kites are particularly susceptible to poisoning. Illegal poison baits set for foxes or crows are indiscriminate and kill protected birds and other animals. There have also been a number of incidents of red kites and other raptors being targeted by wildlife criminals.

On occasion, red kites may directly steal food from humans. One such occurrence took place in Marlow, Buckinghamshire (a town near a major reintroduction site for the species in the UK in the nearby village of Stokenchurch), in which red kites swooped down to steal sandwiches from people in one of the town&#x27;s parks. In another incident, a red kite was reported as having stolen a wasabi-coated pea from a spectator at a cricket match in Wormsley, Buckinghamshire. 

==Distribution and status==

Red kites inhabit broadleaf woodlands, pastures, mixed farmland, valleys and wetland edges, up to at least elevation. They are native to the western Palearctic, with all of the currently known 32,200–37,700 breeding pairs being in Europe. There also used to be breeding populations in western Asia (northern Iran, Syria and Turkey) and northwestern Africa (Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia), but most of these were extirpated in the 19th century or earlier; the only non-European breeding population in recent decades was in Morocco where the last known pair was in 2004. Today it breeds from Portugal and Spain, through the central part of the continent east to European Russia, north to southern Scandinavia, Latvia and the United Kingdom, and south to southern Italy; few if any breeders remain in Balkan. Most red kites that breed in the northern European mainland used to move south or west in winter, typically wintering in Spain and other parts of western Europe with a mild climate, as well as northwestern Africa (Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia) and Turkey. In recent decades, an increasing number of red kites from the northern European mainland have stayed in the region year-round.

The populations in Germany (which alone is home to almost half of the world&#x27;s breeding pairs), France and Spain declined between 1990 and 2000, and overall the species declined by almost 20% over those ten years. Populations in Germany and France have subsequently stabilised, and because of growth in other countries, the overall population is now increasing. The main threats to red kites are poisoning, through illegal direct poisoning and indirect poisoning from pesticides, particularly in the wintering ranges in France and Spain, and changes in agricultural practices causing a reduction in food resources. Other threats include electrocution, hunting and trapping, deforestation, egg-collection (on a local scale) and possibly competition with the generally more successful black kite &quot;M. migrans&quot;.

===Continental Europe===

German populations declined by 25%–30% between 1991 and 1997, but have remained stable since. The populations of the northern foothills of the Harz Mountains (the most densely populated part of its range) suffered an estimated 50% decline from 1991 to 2001. In Spain, the species showed an overall decline in breeding population of up to 43% for the period 1994 to 2001–02, and surveys of wintering birds in 2003–04 suggest a similarly large decline in core wintering areas. The Balearic Islands population has declined from 41 to 47 breeding pairs in 1993 to just 10 in 2003. In France, breeding populations have decreased in the northeast, but seem to be stable in southwest and central France and Corsica. Populations elsewhere are stable or undergoing increases. In Sweden, the species has increased from 30 to 50 pairs in the 1970s to 1,200 breeding pairs in 2003 and has continued growing. In Switzerland, populations have been increasing since the 1990s. Red kites have declined in their traditional strongholds of Spain, France and Germany; while now stable in the last two countries, those populations remain well below their historical peaks. In contrast, red kite populations are increasing in parts of northern Europe, such as Denmark, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The red kite is the official landscape bird of the Swedish province of Scania, and depicted on the coat of arms of the municipality of Tomelilla.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, red kites were ubiquitous scavengers that lived on carrion and rubbish. Shakespeare&#x27;s King Lear describes his daughter Goneril as a &quot;detested kite&quot;, and he wrote &quot;when the kite builds, look to your lesser linen&quot; in reference to them stealing washing hung out to dry in the nesting season. In the mid-15th century, King James II of Scotland decreed that they should be &quot;killed wherever possible&quot;, but they remained protected in England and Wales for the next 100 years as they kept the streets free of carrion and rotting food. Under Tudor &quot;vermin laws&quot; many creatures were seen as competitors for the produce of the countryside and bounties were paid by the parish for their carcasses.

By the 20th century, the breeding population was restricted to a handful of pairs in South Wales, but recently the Welsh population has been supplemented by re-introductions in England and Scotland. In 2004, from 375 occupied territories identified, at least 216 pairs were thought to have hatched eggs and 200 pairs reared at least 286 young. In 1989, six Swedish birds were released at a site in north Scotland and four Swedish and one Welsh bird in Buckinghamshire. Altogether, 93 birds of Swedish and Spanish origin were released at each of the sites. In the second stage of reintroduction in 1995 and 1996, further birds were brought from Germany to populate areas of Dumfries and Galloway. Between 2004 and 2006, 94 birds were brought from the Chilterns and introduced into the Derwent Valley in north East England. In Northern Ireland, 80 birds from wild stock in Wales were released between 2008 and 2010, and the first successful breeding was recorded in 2010. The reintroductions in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty have been a success. Between 1989 and 1993, 90 birds were released there and by 2002, 139 pairs were breeding. They can commonly be seen taking advantage of thermals from the M40 motorway. Another successful reintroduction has been in Northamptonshire, which has become a stronghold for the red kite. Thirty Spanish birds were introduced into Rockingham Forest near Corby in 2000, and by 2010, the RSPB estimated that over 200 chicks had been reared from the initial release. So successful has the reintroduction been that 30 chicks have been transported from Rockingham Forest for release in Cumbria. From the Chilterns they have spread as far east as Essex and can be seen over Harlow. By 2021 they had spread along the M4 as far as the Cotswold Edge overlooking the Severn near Bristol.

A sighting of the first red kite in London for 150 years was reported in &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper in January 2006 and in June of that year, the UK-based Northern Kites Project reported that kites had bred in the Derwent Valley in and around Rowlands Gill, Tyne and Wear for the first time since the re-introduction.

In 1999, the red kite was named &#x27;Bird of the Century&#x27; by the British Trust for Ornithology. According to the Welsh Kite Trust, it has been voted &quot;Wales&#x27;s favourite bird&quot;.

In June 2010, the Forestry Commission North West England announced a three-year project to release 90 red kites in Grizedale Forest, Cumbria under a special licence issued by Natural England. The Grizedale programme was the ninth reintroduction of red kites into different regions of the UK and the final re-introduction phase in England.

The stated aims of the Grizedale project were:
* To establish a viable population of red kites in Grizedale, South Cumbria by 2015.
* To increase the rate of red kite expansion into North West England and link up with existing populations in Wales, Yorkshire, North East England and South West Scotland and so increase the chances of a continuous geographical range.
* To develop community involvement and create educational opportunities arising from the project.

As of July 2011, non-breeding birds are regularly seen in all parts of Britain, and the number of breeding pairs is too large for the RSPB to continue to survey them on an annual basis.

===Ireland===
Red kites were extinct in Ireland by the middle 19th century due to persecution, poisoning and woodland clearance. In May 2007, Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government Dick Roche announced an agreement to bring at least 100 birds from Wales to restock the population as part of a five-year programme in the Wicklow Mountains, similar to the earlier golden eagle reintroduction programme. On 19 July 2007, the first 30 red kites were released in County Wicklow. On 22 May 2010, two newly hatched red kite chicks were discovered in the Wicklow Mountains, bringing the number of chicks hatched since reintroduction to seven.

===Populations and trends by country===

The following figures (mostly estimates) have been collated from various sources. They cover most of the countries in which red kites are believed to have bred.

==Observation==

One of the best places to see the red kite in Scandinavia is Scania in southern Sweden. It may be observed in one of its breeding locations such as the Kullaberg Nature Preserve near Mölle. In Switzerland, they are a common sight in all rural areas, excluding the Alps and its foothills.

Some of the best places to see them in the United Kingdom are Gigrin Farm near Rhayader, mid Wales, where hundreds are fed by the local farmer as a tourist attraction, a Red Kite Feeding Station at Llanddeusant in the Brecon Beacons, visited daily by over 50 birds, and the Bwlch Nant yr Arian forest visitor centre in Ceredigion where the rare leucistic variant can be seen. In England, the Oxfordshire part of the Chilterns has many red kites, especially near Henley-on-Thames and Watlington, where they were introduced on John Paul Getty&#x27;s estate. Red Kites are also becoming common in Buckinghamshire, often being seen near Stokenchurch, where a population was released in the 1990s, and Flackwell Heath near High Wycombe. They can also be seen around Harewood near Leeds where they were re-introduced in 1999. In Ireland they can be best observed at Redcross, near Avoca, County Wicklow.

<text>Arses (; ), also known by his regnal name Artaxerxes IV (; ; ), was the twelfth Achaemenid King of Kings from 338 to 336 BC. 

Arses ascended the throne, after his father Artaxerxes III—who had caused a resurgence of the Persian Empire—was poisoned by the eunuch Bagoas. The latter put Arses on the throne with the expectation of being able to control him. With the weakening of the Achaemenid Empire from the assassination of Artaxerxes III and the succession of Arses, the Greek league sent troops into Asia in 336.

Arses, in an attempt to free himself from Bagoas&#x27; influences, tried to have the eunuch poisoned; but did not succeed, instead succumbing to poison himself at the orders of Bagoas. Bagoas put Arses&#x27; cousin Darius III on the throne after him.

==Name==
He is known as in Greek sources and that seems to have been his real name, but the Xanthus trilingue and potsherds from Samaria report that he took the royal name of Artaxerxes IV, following his father and grandfather.

 is the Greek form of the Old Persian , which is also attested in the Avestan form and is used in multiple Old Persian compound-names, such as , , and . The term is linguistically related to Greek , meaning &quot;male, manly&quot;.

== Biography ==
Arses was the youngest son of Artaxerxes III and his wife Atossa. Arses had several brothers, only one whose name is attested, a certain Bisthanes. Persia was experiencing a resurgence under Artaxerxes III, who reorganized his empire, and suppressed revolts throughout the country. However, the fortunes of Persia came to an abrupt end in autumn of 338, when Artaxerxes III was murdered by the ambitious eunuch and chiliarch Bagoas, who had the king poisoned. Artaxerxes III&#x27;s early death proved to be a problematic issue for Persia, and may have played a role in the weakening of the country. The majority of Artaxerxes III&#x27;s sons, with the exception of Arses and Bisthanes, were also murdered by Bagoas. Bagoas, who wanted to be kingmaker, put the young Arses on the throne.

On his ascension to the throne, Arses most likely assumed the regnal name of Artaxerxes IV. He was put on the throne by Bagoas due to his youth, which the latter sought to take advantage of in order to control him. Around the same period, most of the Greek city-states had joined the Greek league under the leadership of the Macedonian king Philip II, who took advantage of the events in Persia by demanding compensation from the country for helping the town of Perinthus during the reign of Artaxerxes III. Arses declined, and as a result, a Greek expedition was started with Philip II as general, who sent 10,000 Macedonian soldiers into Asia in 336 BC. At the same time, however, Arses was determined on trying to free himself from Bagoas&#x27; authority and influence; he made an unsuccessful effort to have the latter poisoned, only to be poisoned himself along with the rest of his family by Bagoas, who put Arses&#x27; cousin Darius III on the throne. Macedonian propaganda, made in order to legitimize the conquests of Alexander the Great a few years later, accused Darius III of playing a key role in the murder of Arses, who was portrayed as the last king of the Achaemenid royal house.

==Coinage==

There is no dynastic coinage of Artaxerxes IV, but it is thought he may be depicted as a young ruler wearing the Pharaonic crown on the reverse of some of the contemporary coinage of satrap Mazaios in Cilicia, while his father Artaxerxes III appears seated, also in Pharaonic dress, on the obverse.

<text>Thin-film memory is a high-speed alternative to magnetic-core memory developed by Sperry Rand in a government-funded research project.

Instead of threading individual ferrite cores on wires, thin-film memory consisted of 4-micrometer thick dots of permalloy, an iron–nickel alloy, deposited on small glass plates by vacuum evaporation techniques and a mask. The drive and sense lines were then added using printed circuit wiring over the alloy dots. This provided very fast access times in the range of 670 nanoseconds, but was very expensive to produce.

In 1962, the UNIVAC 1107, intended for the civilian marketplace, used thin-film memory only for its 128-word general register stack. Military computers, where cost was less of a concern, used larger amounts of thin-film memory. Thin film was also used in a number of high-speed computer projects, including the high-end of the IBM System/360 line, but general advances in core tended to keep pace.

<doc id="200953" wikidata="Q741321" url="?curid=200953" title="Woody Woodpecker">
<text>Woody Woodpecker is a cartoon character that appeared in theatrical short films produced by the Walter Lantz Studio and Universal Animation Studio and distributed by Universal Pictures since 1940. Woody&#x27;s last theatrical cartoon was produced by Walter Lantz in 1972.

Woody, an anthropomorphic woodpecker, was created in 1940 by Lantz and storyboard artist Ben &quot;Bugs&quot; Hardaway, who had previously laid the groundwork for two other screwball characters, Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, at the Warner Bros. cartoon studio in the late 1930s. Woody&#x27;s character and design evolved over the years, from an insane bird with an unusually garish design to a more refined-looking and acting character in the vein of the later Chuck Jones version of Bugs Bunny. Woody was originally voiced by prolific voice actor Mel Blanc, who was succeeded in the shorts by Danny Webb, Kent Rogers, Dick Nelson, Ben Hardaway, and, finally, Grace Stafford (wife of Walter Lantz).

Woody Woodpecker cartoons were first broadcast on television in 1957 under the title &quot;The Woody Woodpecker Show&quot;, which featured Lantz cartoons bookended by new footage of Woody and live-action footage of Lantz. Lantz produced theatrical cartoons longer than most of his contemporaries, and Woody Woodpecker remained a staple of Universal&#x27;s release schedule until 1972 when Lantz finally closed down his studio. The character has been revived since then for special productions and occasions, as well as for &quot;The New Woody Woodpecker Show&quot;, a Saturday-morning cartoon television series featuring prolific voice actor Billy West as Woody that aired from 1999 to 2002. In 2017, a live-action/CGI hybrid feature film, &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot;, was released theatrically in Latin America, while released direct-to-video in other territories. It was followed by a new series of shorts released via YouTube beginning in 2018. In 2024, a new film, &quot;Woody Woodpecker Goes to Camp&quot;, was released on Netflix.

Woody has a motion picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard. He also made a cameo appearance alongside many other famous cartoon characters in the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. Woody Woodpecker is the official mascot of Universal Pictures. Woody and his friends are also icons at the Universal Studios Theme Parks worldwide, as well as the PortAventura Park in the Salou, Spain, where they remain despite Universal no longer having a financial stake in the park.

==Origin==
The inspiration for the character allegedly came during producer Walter Lantz&#x27;s honeymoon with his wife, Grace, in June Lake, California in 1940, a dubious story given the fact that Woody&#x27;s first appearance predated Lantz and Stafford&#x27;s honeymoon. A noisy acorn woodpecker outside their cabin kept the couple awake at night, and when heavy rain started, they learned that the bird had bored holes in their cabin&#x27;s roof. Walter and Gracie told Dallas attorney Rod Phelps during a visit that Walter wanted to shoot the bird, but Gracie suggested that her husband make a cartoon about the bird, and thus Woody was born. However, according to Lantz&#x27;s biographer Joe Adamson, Ben Hardaway and L.E. Elliott had written a story where Andy Panda and his father, Papa Panda, experienced roof troubles caused by a rainstorm. Lantz took one look at the storyboard and found it &quot;too expensive&quot;. He needed a roofing problem that was easier to animate, and suggested a pesky bird like a woodpecker (a couple of Lantz&#x27;s 1930s cartoons, including the 1936 Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoon &quot;Night Life of the Bugs&quot;, had featured incidental woodpeckers). Woody shares many characteristics in common with the pileated woodpecker in terms of both physical appearance as well as his characteristic laugh, which resembles the call of the pileated woodpecker. These similarities are the result of the artistic license of the creators and have caused much confusion within the birding community among those who have attempted to classify Woody&#x27;s species.

In the short &quot;Dumb Like a Fox&quot; (1964), a museum offers a 25-dollar reward to anyone who captures a &quot;Campephilus principalis&quot;, which is Woody Woodpecker himself.

==History==
===Early years===
Woody Woodpecker first appeared in the short &quot;Knock Knock&quot; on November 25, 1940. The cartoon ostensibly stars Andy Panda and Papa Panda, but it is Woody who dominates. The woodpecker constantly pesters the two pandas, apparently just for the fun of it. Meanwhile, Andy tries to sprinkle salt on Woody&#x27;s tail, believing that this will capture the bird. To Woody&#x27;s surprise, Andy&#x27;s attempts prevail, and Woody is taken away to the psychiatric hospital but not before his captors prove to be crazier than he is.

The Woody of &quot;Knock Knock&quot; was designed by animator Alex Lovy. Woody&#x27;s original voice actor, Mel Blanc, stopped performing the character after the first three cartoons to work exclusively for Leon Schlesinger Productions (later renamed Warner Bros. Cartoons), producer of Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; after signing a loyalty contract. At Leon Schlesinger&#x27;s, Blanc had already established the voices of two other famous &quot;screwball&quot; characters who preceded Woody, Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny. Ironically, Blanc&#x27;s characterization of the Woody Woodpecker laugh had initially been applied to the prototype of Bugs Bunny, in shorts such as those above &quot;Elmer&#x27;s Candid Camera&quot; and was later transferred to Woody. Blanc&#x27;s regular speaking voice for Woody was much like the early Daffy Duck, minus the lisp. Once Warner Bros. signed Blanc to an exclusive contract, Woody&#x27;s voice-over work was taken over by Danny Webb, followed by Kent Rogers and Dick Nelson, and Ben Hardaway later became Woody&#x27;s voice after Rogers was sent to the army during World War II and would voice the woodpecker for the rest of the decade. This makes Woody Woodpecker one of the very few cartoon characters initially voiced by Mel Blanc to be voiced by someone else during Blanc&#x27;s lifetime. Despite this, Blanc continued to voice Woody on a Mutual Network radio show and in recordings for Capitol Records from 1948 until 1955, while his laugh would continue to be used in the shorts until 1951.

Audiences reacted well to &quot;Knock Knock&quot;, and Lantz realized he had finally hit upon a star to replace the waning Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Woody starred in several films. The character&#x27;s brash demeanor was a natural hit during World War II. His image appeared on US aircraft as nose art and on mess halls, and audiences on the homefront watched Woody cope with familiar problems such as food shortages. The 1943 Woody cartoon &quot;The Dizzy Acrobat&quot; was nominated for the 1943 Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons), which it lost to the MGM &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoon &quot;The Yankee Doodle Mouse&quot;. Woody Woodpecker&#x27;s debut also marked a change in directing style for Walter Lantz studio, since the character was heavily inspired by Tex Avery-created Looney Tunes character Daffy Duck at Warner Bros, and thus Woody&#x27;s cartoons tended to have a hint of Tex Avery&#x27;s style and influence in terms of humor, and that&#x27;s what gave Walter Lantz studio its fame. Curiously enough, Avery himself never directed a Woody Woodpecker short while at the Walter Lantz studio.
Animator Emery Hawkins and layout artist Art Heinemann streamlined Woody&#x27;s appearance for the 1944 film &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, directed by James &quot;Shamus&quot; Culhane. The bird became rounder, cuter, and less demented. He also sported a simplified color scheme and a brighter smile, making him much more like his counterparts at Warner Bros. and MGM. Nevertheless, Culhane continued to use Woody as an aggressive lunatic, not a domesticated straight man or defensive homebody, as many other studios&#x27; characters had become. The follow-up to &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, &quot;The Beach Nut&quot;, introduced Woody&#x27;s original chief nemesis, Wally Walrus.

Woody&#x27;s wild days were numbered, however. In 1946, Lantz hired Disney veteran Dick Lundy to direct Woody&#x27;s cartoons. Lundy rejected Culhane&#x27;s take on the series and made Woody more defensive; the bird no longer went insane without a legitimate reason. Lundy also paid more attention to animation, making Woody&#x27;s new films more Disney-esque in their design, style, animation, and timing. Lundy&#x27;s last film for Disney was the Donald Duck short &quot;Flying Jalopy&quot;. This cartoon is played much like a Woody Woodpecker short, down to the laugh in the end. It also features a bad guy named &quot;Ben Buzzard&quot; who bears a strong resemblance to Buzz Buzzard, a Lantz character introduced in &quot;Wet Blanket Policy&quot; (1948), who eventually succeeded Wally Walrus as Woody&#x27;s primary antagonist.

In 1947, contract renewal negotiations between Lantz and Universal (now Universal-International) fell through, and Lantz began distributing his cartoons through United Artists. The UA-distributed Lantz cartoons featured higher-quality animation and the influence of Dick Lundy (the films&#x27; budgets remained the same). Former Disney animators such as Fred Moore and Ed Love began working at Lantz and assisted Lundy in adding touches of the Disney style to Woody&#x27;s cartoons. Despite the Disney style added for the later cartoons, Woody&#x27;s cartoons still try to maintain a good dose of slapstick and madcap humor from the pre-Lundy cartoons.

===&quot;The Woody Woodpecker Song&quot;===
In 1947, Woody got his theme song when musicians George Tibbles and Ramey Idriss wrote &quot;The Woody Woodpecker Song&quot;, making ample use of the character&#x27;s famous laugh. Kay Kyser&#x27;s 1948 recording of the song, with Harry Babbitt&#x27;s laugh interrupting vocalist Gloria Wood, became one of the biggest hit singles of 1948. Other artists did covers, including Woody&#x27;s original voice actor, Mel Blanc. Lantz first used &quot;The Woody Woodpecker Song&quot; in &quot;Wet Blanket Policy&quot; (1948), and it became the first and only song from an animated short subject to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1948, but it lost out to &quot;Buttons and Bows&quot;. Lantz soon adopted the song as Woody&#x27;s theme music.

&quot;The Woody Woodpecker Song&quot; and the &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; cartoons extensively used Woody&#x27;s famous laugh, upsetting the man who created it, Mel Blanc. He first used the laughter, in a different recording, for the seminal pre-Bugs Bunny character in 1938&#x27;s &quot;Porky&#x27;s Hare Hunt&quot;. Although Blanc had only recorded three shorts as the voice of Woody, his laugh had been recorded as a stock sound effect and used in every subsequent &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; short up until this point. Blanc sued Lantz and lost, but Lantz settled out of court when Blanc filed an appeal. Although Lantz stopped using Blanc&#x27;s Woody Woodpecker laugh as a stock effect in the early 1950s, Blanc&#x27;s voice was still heard saying &quot;Guess who?&quot; at the beginning of every cartoon for the duration of the &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; series.

===Financial impasse/hiatus===
Financial problems at United Artists during the aftermath of the Paramount case—which forced movie distributors to end the practice of block booking, or selling shorts and features to theaters in packages—affected Lantz. The revenues Lantz received from UA&#x27;s distribution of his cartoons were much lower than his returns had been from Universal. Once the Lantz studio hit its loan debt cap of $250,000 at the Bank of America, Lantz was forced to shut the studio down. He began a series of staggered layoffs in December 1948 until work on the final 1940s Lantz short, the Woody cartoon &quot;Drooler&#x27;s Delight&quot;, was finished at the otherwise shuttered studio in early 1949.

Walter Lantz Productions remained closed for a full calendar year. During this time, Walter Lantz and his wife, actress Grace Stafford, toured Europe to spend money impounded there after World War II and also to entertain the European Universal exchanges still distributing the Universal era Lantz cartoons. By keeping the studio closed while the Universal and United Artists &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; cartoons were still in distribution, Lantz was able to amass enough income to pay off the studio&#x27;s debts and upgrade the studio, after which time the studio finally reopened with a reduced staff.

===Later films===
The revived Lantz studio&#x27;s first new project was an animated segment of the feature film &quot;Destination Moon&quot; (1950), produced by Lantz&#x27;s friend George Pál. In the segment, astronauts are shown an animated educational film featuring Woody Woodpecker explaining rocket propulsion.

Beginning with &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, Woody&#x27;s voice was assumed by Grace Stafford. According to the Lantzes, Stafford slipped a recording of herself into a stack of audition tapes, and her husband chose her without knowing her identity. Lantz also began having Stafford supply Woody&#x27;s laugh due to the court settlement with Mel Blanc, but Stafford was not credited for the role at her request until &quot;Misguided Missile&quot; (1958), as she felt audiences might reject a woman performing Woody&#x27;s voice. She also tried to tone down the character through their voice work to appease Universal&#x27;s complaints about Woody&#x27;s raucousness.

Lantz signed again with Universal (now Universal-International) in 1950 and began production on two entries that director Dick Lundy and storymen Ben Hardaway and Heck Allen had begun before the 1948 layoff. These shorts have no director&#x27;s credit, as Lantz claimed to have directed them himself. &quot;Puny Express&quot; (1951) was the first to be released, followed by &quot;Sleep Happy&quot;. These shorts marked a departure from past dialogue-driven shorts. Though Stafford now voiced Woody, her job was limited, as Woody (and other characters) rarely spoke in the first dozen or so shorts. Because of these entries, Woody became popular outside the English-speaking world, thanks to the lack of a language barrier (&quot;The Pink Panther&quot; shorts of the 1960s and 1970s also enjoyed worldwide popularity due to this pantomime luxury).

Nine more Lantz-directed Woody cartoons followed before Don Patterson became Woody&#x27;s new director in 1952. The bird was redesigned again, this time by animator LaVerne Harding. Harding made Woody smaller and cuter, moving his crest forward from its original backward position. The small Lantz Studios logo seen at the start of every cartoon — Woody as an armored knight on horseback carrying a lance — continued for a while to display Woody with his former topknot. For 1955&#x27;s &quot;The Tree Medic&quot;, one last makeover was given to the woodpecker, making Woody&#x27;s eye a simple black dot and removing the green/hazel iris he had had since his beginnings, but Woody&#x27;s eyes were not changed in the cartoon&#x27;s intros, and they remained green for the rest of the shorts&#x27; production run. During this time, the opening was changed as well. Instead of having Woody&#x27;s name on-screen and Woody pecking a hole in the screen to introduce himself, Woody now pecked his way onto the screen, greeting the audience with his iconic &quot;Guess who?&quot;, then carved out his name on either a brown or gray wood background and jumped around the screen while laughing.

By 1955, Paul J. Smith had taken over as the primary director of Woody&#x27;s shorts, with periodic fill-in shorts directed by Alex Lovy and Jack Hannah, among others. With Smith on board, the shorts maintained a healthy dose of frenetic energy, while the animation was simplified due to budget constraints.
In addition to Stafford providing Woody&#x27;s voice, which returned the cartoon to being more dialogue-driven again, voice talents during this period were generally split between Dallas McKennon and Daws Butler. Several of Woody&#x27;s recurring costars were also introduced during this era, such as Gabby Gator (voiced by Butler in an Ozarks voice, a slightly different southern dialect than he used for Huckleberry Hound). Gabby first appeared in &quot;Everglade Raid&quot; (as &quot;Al I. Gator&quot;). Other films paired Woody with a girlfriend, Winnie Woodpecker (voiced by Stafford), and a niece and nephew, Splinter and Knothead (both voiced by June Foray). Other antagonists that Woody has dealt with were Ms. Meany (voiced by Stafford) and Dapper Denver Dooley (voiced by McKennon).

===Woody in the television era===
As Lantz was struggling financially, Woody&#x27;s longevity was secured when he made the jump to television in &quot;The Woody Woodpecker Show&quot; on ABC. The half-hour program consisted of three theatrical Woody shorts followed by a brief look at cartoon creation hosted by Lantz. It ran from 1957 to 1958 then entered syndication until 1966. NBC revived the show in 1970 and 1976. In addition, the woodpecker was no longer dishing out abuse to his foils, but was instead on the receiving end. The first significant short to feature Woody as a serious, put-upon character was 1961&#x27;s &quot;Franken-Stymied&quot;. Woody&#x27;s popularity had been based on his manic craziness, but by 1961, this had all but been eliminated in favor of a more serious Woody, a straight man trying to do good. This was due in part to Woody&#x27;s large presence on television, which meant Lantz had to meet the stringent rules against violence for children&#x27;s television. Though production continued until 1972, the cartoons were a definite notch lower than in the 1940s and 1950s.

Woody appeared in new theatrical shorts until 1972, when Lantz closed his studio due to rising production costs. His cartoons returned to syndication in the late 1970s. Lantz sold his library of Woody shorts to MCA/Universal in 1985. Universal repackaged the cartoons for another syndicated &quot;Woody Woodpecker Show&quot; in 1987. A year later, Woody made a cameo in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, voiced by Cherry Davis, near the end of the film.

Woody Woodpecker reappeared in the Fox Kids series &quot;The New Woody Woodpecker Show&quot;, which ran on Saturday mornings from 1999 to 2002, voiced by Billy West. For this series, Woody was redesigned more like his mid-1940s look (1944 to 1949), pushing back his crest and making his eyes green again. Winnie Woodpecker, who had debuted in &quot;Real Gone Woody&quot; (1954), became a semi-regular character as Woody&#x27;s primary love interest. Like Woody, Winnie was redesigned to look almost exactly like Woody did from 1950 until 1972, the obvious differences being that she was a female woodpecker and had blue eyes. Woody&#x27;s primary antagonist was Wally Walrus, who became Woody&#x27;s neighbor (Woody lived in a tree house in Mrs. Meany&#x27;s front yard, and Wally lived next door). Buzz Buzzard often appeared, as did Mrs. Meany and several other older characters.

In 2018, a new series of &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; cartoons began streaming exclusively for YouTube, simply titled &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot;.

In August 2023, MeTV acquired the broadcast rights to Walter Lantz cartoons from 1934 to 1972 to air &quot;The Woody Woodpecker Show&quot; on Saturday morning on September 2, marking the return on TV after 25 years.

==Reception==

The &quot;Woody Woodpecker Show&quot; was named the 88th best animated series by IGN.

===Legacy===

Walter Lantz and movie pioneer George Pal were good friends. Woody Woodpecker cameos in nearly every film that Pal produced or directed; for example, during the 1966 sequence in &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1960), a little girl drops her Woody Woodpecker doll as she goes into an air raid shelter. In &quot;Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze&quot; (1975), Grace Stafford cameos, carrying a Woody Woodpecker doll.

Obvious references to &quot;The Woody Woodpecker Song&quot; can be found in the work of at least two noted jazz innovators: specifically, Charlie Parker, a number of whose solos quote it in passing, and Wayne Shorter, whose 1961 composition &quot;Look at the Birdie&quot; — as heard on Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers&#x27; &quot;Roots &amp; Herbs&quot; (recorded in 1961, released in 1970) — has been singled out by both composer/trumpeter David Weiss and Shorter&#x27;s biographer Michelle Mercer as an ingenious variation on the theme. In addition, a full-fledged cover of the song itself was recorded in 1986 by jazz trumpeter Woody Shaw for his 1987 release, &quot;Solid&quot;.

In 1983–1984, Catapult musicians Aart Mol, Cees Bergman, Elmer Veerhoff, Erwin van Prehn and Geertjan Hessing (under the pseudonym &quot;Adams &amp; Fleisner&quot;) wrote and produced &quot;Woodpeckers from Space&quot; by VideoKids, a synth-pop cover of &quot;The Woody Woodpecker Song&quot;. Released on 4 September 1984, the song became a number 1 hit in Spain and Norway. The idea for the song began when the children of Gert van den Bosch (co-founder of Boni Records) asked him if he could produce a record based on Woody Woodpecker, whom they were big fans of. The Woody laugh used in the song was first heard in &quot;Let&#x27;s Break&quot; by Master Genius in 1983, another Cat Music project. The band&#x27;s animated mascot, a &quot;spacepecker&quot; named Tico Tac, was created and used in place of Woody in order to avoid a lawsuit from Universal. The band lasted from 1984 to 1988.

The Baltimora song &quot;Woody Boogie&quot;, released in 1985, notably features a synthesizer replaying Woody Woodpecker&#x27;s laugh, which is incorporated into the chorus as well as other parts of the song.

Woody was number 46 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;&#x27;s list of the 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time in 2002 and 2003. He came in at number 25 on Animal Planet&#x27;s list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Movie Animals&quot; in 2004. The character has been referenced and spoofed on many later television programs, among them &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, and Flash Toons.

Like Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros., Sonic the Hedgehog for Sega, Mario for Nintendo and Mickey Mouse for Disney, Woody Woodpecker serves as the official mascot of Universal Pictures. In 1998 and 1999, Woody appeared on the nose of the Williams Formula One Team, and in 2000, he became the official team mascot of the Honda Motorcycle Racing Team. A Woody Woodpecker balloon had been a staple of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1982 until 1996.

In Brazil, the character is a hugely popular and iconic cartoon character.

==Home media==

A handful of non-comprehensive Woody Woodpecker VHS tapes were issued by Universal in the 1980s and 1990s, usually including Andy Panda and Chilly Willy cartoons as bonuses. A few were widely released on VHS in the mid-1980s by Kid Pics Video, an American company of dubious legality, which packaged the Woody cartoons with bootlegged Disney cartoons. In the early 2000s, a series of mail-order &quot;Woody Woodpecker Show&quot; VHS tapes and DVDs were made available by mail order through Columbia House.

In 2007, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released &quot;The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection&quot;, a three-disc DVD boxed set compilation of Walter Lantz &quot;Cartunes&quot;. The first forty-five Woody Woodpecker shorts from &quot;Knock Knock&quot; to &quot;The Great Who-Dood-It&quot; were presented in the box set in chronological order of release, with various &quot;Chilly Willy&quot;, &quot;Andy Panda&quot;, &quot;Swing Symphonies&quot;, and other Lantz shorts also included. &quot;The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection: Volume 2&quot;, including the next forty-five Woody cartoons — &quot;Termites from Mars&quot; through &quot;Jittery Jester&quot; — was released in 2008. A plain-vanilla best-of release, titled &quot;Woody Woodpecker Favorites&quot;, was released in 2009, which contained no new-to-DVD material.

&quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; shorts have been released for the first time on Blu-ray; labeled as the &quot;Screwball Collection&quot;, the set was released on September 7, 2021.

Blanc originated the voice, in a characterization similar to his Daffy Duck, minus the lisp, with the recording slightly sped up to give a higher-pitched tone to the voice. He stated that the laugh originated from a type of laugh he used to do at school and he just added the pecking sounds to the laugh. That practice continued with other voice artists.

===Film===

In the early 2010s, Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment planned a &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; feature film. John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky (&quot;King of the Hill&quot;) were in talks to develop a story, but the project was canceled. In 2013, Bill Kopp was attached to direct an animated feature film with three interwoven stories, but the project was later canceled.

A live-action/CGI hybrid film based on &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot;, directed by Alex Zamm and starring Timothy Omundson and Brazilian actress Thaila Ayala, was released theatrically in Brazil on October 5, 2017, and was scheduled for release on April 1, 2018, worldwide. The film had a straight-to-video release in the United States on February 6, 2018. A sequel titled &quot;Woody Woodpecker Goes to Camp&quot; was released on Netflix on April 12, 2024.

==Comics==
Woody was the star of a number of comic book series published in the U.S. and around the world. The main title, &quot;Walter Lantz Woody Woodpecker&quot;, ran from 1952 to 1983.

Woody first appeared as a comic book character in 1942, appearing alongside Andy Panda and Oswald the Rabbit in Dell Comics&#x27; &quot;New Funnies&quot;, an anthology comic that featured a number of other Lantz characters. Eventually, Woody became the star of &quot;New Funnies&quot;, leading to &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; solo comics appearing as part of Dell Comics&#x27; &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; one-shot series, beginning in 1947.

&quot;Walter Lantz Woody Woodpecker&quot; became an independent comic book (starting with issue #16 to reflect the earlier appearances in &quot;Four Color&quot;) in Dec. 1952-Jan. 1953. It ran for 201 issues, published by Dell and then Western Publishing (Whitman/Gold Key), lasting until 1983.

Woody&#x27;s niece and nephew Splinter and Knothead first made their appearances in the comics, later appearing in the cartoons.

Notable creators involved with the &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; comic included Carl Fallberg, Paul Murry, Tony Strobl, Frank Thomas, and in the European comics, Freddy Milton.

Woody also starred in a short-lived comic strip, syndicated by Consolidated News Features, in the early 1950s.

Foreign-language versions of the Woody Woodpecker comic were published in many European countries, most actively in Sweden (&quot;Hacke Hackspett&quot;), the Netherlands, France, and Italy (&quot;Picchiarello&quot;).

<text>Ian Rank-Broadley FRBS (born 1952) is a British sculptor who has produced many acclaimed works, among which are several designs for British coinage and the memorial statue of Princess Diana at Kensington Palace, which was unveiled on her 60th birthday in 2021.

==Biography==
Born in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, Rank-Broadley was educated at Epsom School of Art (1970–74) tutored by Bruce McLean, and Slade School of Fine Art, UCL (1974–76) with Reg Butler as his Director of Studies, Michael Kenny and John Davies as tutors, where he was awarded the Boise Travelling Scholarship. He then continued his studies at the British School at Rome. On his return to the U.K. he started as a professional sculptor specialising in low relief sculpture. He has assisted the sculptors Reg Butler and Ralph Brown RA.

A member of the Royal British Society of Sculptors (Associate 1989, Fellow 1994), and a Brother of the Art Workers Guild (1995), he was made a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in 1996 and granted the Freedom of the City of London. He was elevated to the Livery in 2009. In 2010 he was appointed as Trustee to The Prince&#x27;s School of Traditional Arts. His works are in the permanent collections of the British Museum, London&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery, the Ashmolean Museum, Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, the Rijksmuseum, and several others.

He lives and works in Gloucestershire. He is married to Hazel and has one daughter.

==Sculpture==

Jonathan Jones has noted Rank-Bradley&#x27;s &quot;taste for the nude&quot;. Rank-Broadley writes, &quot;The choice of the male figure / nude as a dominant motif was made quite early when I realised that the female nude had, to a large extent, been robbed of its power by the commercial world of advertising, whereas the male nude still retained a power that could excite, grab attention and shock.&quot;

In 1996 he won the Prize for his bronze maquette for Dante’s Gates of Hell, at XI Biennale Dantesca, Ravenna, Italy.

In 2007, the Armed Forces Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum was dedicated, containing two large figure groups, comprising fourteen figures, each one and a quarter times life size, by Rank-Broadley as part of its centre piece. For this work he received the 2008 Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture.

In 2010 he executed a memorial to Dean Colet, founder of St Paul&#x27;s School, London, which can be seen in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London.
Other major works are St Matthew at St Matthew&#x27;s Church, Northampton, H M Queen in Garter robes at the Supreme Court, Charles James Fox at Chertsey, the Royal Anglian Regiment&#x27;s memorial, Imperial War Museum Duxford.
A major patron was the publisher Felix Dennis for whom Rank-Broadley has sculpted the figures of Josephine Baker, Billie Holiday and &quot;Lord Rochester, his Whore and a Monkey&quot; for his Garden of Heroes and Villains.

In 2018, Rank-Broadley completed a portrait bust of the Welsh poet RJ Arkhipov. Arkhipov&#x27;s experience with the sculptor inspired his poem &quot;The Sculptor&quot;.

On 10 December 2017 it was announced Rank-Broadley had been commissioned by the sons of Diana, Princess of Wales to execute a statue in her memory. Its completion was initially expected in 2019 but its unveiling in the Sunken Garden at Kensington Palace was delayed until 1 July 2021. In his review, Jonathan Jones noted its &quot;aesthetic awfulness ... Flat, cautious realism softened by a vague attempt to be intimate make this a spiritless and characterless hunk of nonsense.&quot;

==Coins and medals==
In 1997 he won the Royal Mint competition for a new effigy of Elizabeth II to appear on the obverse of circulated British and some Commonwealth coinage from 1998 onward. Later that year, he also won a Royal Mint competition for his design of the Queen Mother Centennial crown coin. In 2002 his design of the reverse of a British Five Pound coin was issued. He also designed the conjoint portrait of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip on the 2007 crown coin, celebrating their sixtieth wedding anniversary. It is the third time Rank-Broadley has designed both the obverse and reverse of a single coin. More recently he has been commissioned to design and model the gold kilo coin celebrating the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee.

In 2012 he was recognized with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Vicenza Numismatica.

<doc id="200956" wikidata="Q5419631" url="?curid=200956" title="Excitable Boy">
<text>Excitable Boy is the third studio album by American musician Warren Zevon. The album was released on January 18, 1978, by Asylum Records. It includes the single &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;, which reached No. 21 and remained in the American Top 40 for six weeks. The album brought Zevon to commercial attention and remains the best-selling album of his career, having been certified platinum by the RIAA and reaching the top ten on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. A remastered and expanded edition was released in 2007.

== Music and lyrics ==
&quot;Excitable Boy&quot; and &quot;Werewolves of London&quot; were considered macabrely humorous by some critics. The historical &quot;Veracruz&quot; dramatizes the United States occupation of Veracruz. It was the first song Zevon wrote with Jorge Calderón. Likewise, &quot;Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner&quot; is a fictionalized account of former mercenary David Lindell&#x27;s experiences in Africa. &quot;Lawyers, Guns and Money&quot; is a tongue-in-cheek tale of a young American man&#x27;s adventures in Cold War-era Latin America. In addition, there are two ballads about life and relationships (&quot;Accidentally Like a Martyr&quot; and &quot;Tenderness on the Block&quot;), as well as the funk/disco-inspired &quot;Nighttime in the Switching Yard&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote:
&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; panned the album, writing that Zevon&#x27;s famous friends contributing to &quot;this improbable collection of tunes is a testament to the constant in-breeding among the California types that have so deteriorated the scene out there.&quot;

<doc id="200958" wikidata="Q165177" url="?curid=200958" title="100 Greatest Britons">
<text>100 Greatest Britons is a television series that was broadcast by the BBC in 2002. It was based on a television poll conducted to determine who the British people at that time considered the greatest Britons in history. The series included individual programmes featuring the top ten, with viewers having further opportunity to vote after each programme. It concluded with a debate and final determination of the ranking of the top ten. Although many living people were included among the top 100, all of the top ten were deceased.

==Poll==
The poll resulted in nominees including Guy Fawkes, who was executed because of his role in the plot to blow up the Parliament of England; Oliver Cromwell, who created a republican British state (the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland); Richard III, suspected of murdering his nephews; James Connolly, an Irish nationalist and socialist who was executed by the Crown due to his part in the 1916 Easter Rising; Thomas Paine, who wrote against the British crown before and during the American Revolution; John Lydon, the lead vocalist of the Sex Pistols; Enoch Powell, a conservative politician; and a surprisingly high ranking of 17th for actor and singer Michael Crawford, the second-highest-ranked entertainer, after John Lennon. Diana, Princess of Wales, was judged to be a greater historical figure than Isaac Newton, William Shakespeare, and Charles Darwin by BBC respondents to the survey.

One of the more controversial figures to be included on the list was the occultist Aleister Crowley. His works had a direct influence on the rise in popular occultism and some forms of Neopaganism in the 20th century. In addition to the Britons, some notable non-British entrants were listed, including two Irish nationals, the philanthropic musicians Bono and Bob Geldof. Of the top 20 entries 16 were people of English origin. Elizabeth I was part of a Welsh royal house, Sir Ernest Shackleton and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, were both Anglo-Irish in what is now the Republic of Ireland when all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, and Alexander Fleming in 20th place was Scottish. 

Only 13 of the 100 are women. Sixty had lived in the 20th century. The highest-ranked living person was Margaret Thatcher, placed 16th. Ringo Starr was the only member of the Beatles not on the list. Isambard Kingdom Brunel occupied the top spot in the polls for some time thanks largely to &quot;students from Brunel University who have been campaigning vigorously for the engineer for weeks.&quot; However, a late surge in the final week of voting put Churchill into first place.

=== Reaction of black Britons ===
There were no black Britons voted on the list, prompting consternation from members of the black British community that their contribution and history in the United Kingdom were not being sufficiently recognised. A separate three-month survey was conducted among the public, resulting in the publication of &quot;100 Great Black Britons&quot;, a list of the 100 greatest black Britons as judged by the British public. In 2004, two years after the &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot; list was voted on, social campaigner Patrick Vernon created a similar poll exclusively voted upon by members of the black British community, with Mary Seacole being named the greatest black Briton for her actions during the Crimean War with Russia.

The inclusion of Queen Philippa of Hainault on the list was criticised, as historians dispute that she was &quot;black&quot; in any modern sense. She was of predominantly European ancestry, with remote Armenian ancestry on her father&#x27;s side, and Cuman (Turkic/Asian) ancestry on her mother&#x27;s side. A report written by Bishop Walter Stapledon in about 1319 describes either Philippa (then a child) or one of her sisters as &quot;brown of skin all over&quot;, with hair &quot;betwixt blue-black and brown&quot;; but, aside from the confusion over who is being described, it is unclear precisely what these terms imply. All known portraits appear to show Philippa as white. Historian Kathryn Warner concludes that she was &quot;a European woman and emphatically not of African ancestry&quot;.

==The list==
Although the BBC&#x27;s original ranked list has been removed from their web server and what remains is only an alphabetical list of the Top 100, several other sources have preserved the original ranked list.

There was some question as to whether the Richard Burton listed at No. 96 was the actor or the explorer. A BBC press release makes clear that the actor was intended.

<text>The AN/UYK-8 was a UNIVAC computer.

==Development==
In April 1967, UNIVAC received a contract from the US Navy for design, development, testing and delivery of the AN/UYK-8 microelectronics computer for use with the AN/TYA-20.

The AN/UYK-8 was built to replace the CP-808 (Marine Corps air cooled AN/USQ-20 variant) in the Beach Relay Link-11 communication system, the AN/TYQ-3 in a AN/TYA-20

== Technical ==
It used the same 30-bit words and instruction set as the AN/USQ-17 and AN/USQ-20 Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) computers, built with &quot;first generation integrated circuits&quot;. This made it about one quarter of the volume of the AN/USQ-20. It had two processors instead of just one.

Instructions were represented as 30-bit words, in the following format:
 f 6 bits function code 
 j 3 bits jump condition designator 
 k 3 bits partial word designator 
 b 3 bits which seven index register to use (B0=non used) 
 s 2 bits which S (5bits) register to use S0,S1,S2,S3(P(17-13))
 y 13 bits operand address in memory
 memory address = Bb + Ss + y = 18 bit (262,144 words)

Numbers were represented as full 30-bit words. This also allowed for five 6-bit alphanumeric characters per word.

The main memory was increased to 262,144 words (256K words) of magnetic core memory.

The available processor registers were:
* one 30-bit arithmetic (A) register.
* a contiguous 30-bit Q register (total of 60 bits for the result of multiplication or the dividend in division).
* seven 30-bit index (B) registers.

<doc id="200960" wikidata="Q622500" url="?curid=200960" title="Château d'If">
<text>The Château d&#x27;If () is a fortress located on the Île d&#x27;If, the smallest island in the Frioul archipelago, situated about offshore from Marseille in southeastern France. Built in the 16th century, it later served as a prison until the end of the 19th century. The fortress was demilitarized and opened to the public in 1890. It is famous for being one of the settings of Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s adventure novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;. It is one of the most visited sites in the city of Marseille (nearly 100,000 visitors per year).

The city of Marseille can be admired to the east of the Château d&#x27;If.

==Island==
The Île d&#x27;If measures and is located west of the Old Port of Marseille. The entire island is heavily fortified; high ramparts with gun platforms surmount the cliffs, which rise steeply from the surrounding ocean. Apart from the fortress, the island is uninhabited.

== Fortress ==
The &quot;château&quot; is a square, three-story building long on each side, flanked by three towers with large gun embrasures. It was built from 1524 to 1531 on the orders of King Francis I, who, during a visit in 1516, saw the island as a strategically important location for defending the coastline from sea-based attacks.

The castle&#x27;s principal military value was as a deterrent; it never had to fight off an actual attack. The closest that it came to a genuine test of strength was in July 1531, when the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V made preparations to attack Marseille. However, he abandoned the invasion plan.

In 1701, the military engineer Vauban questioned its suitability to defend against an actual attack: &quot;The fortifications look like the rock[;] they are fully rendered, but very roughly and carelessly, with many imperfections. The whole [has] been very badly built[...] with little care [...] All the buildings [are] very crudely done [and] ill made.&quot;

The embalmed body of general Jean Baptiste Kléber was repatriated to France after his assassination in Cairo in 1800. First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, fearing that his tomb would become a symbol to Republicanism, ordered that the body stay at the château. It remained there for 18 years, until King Louis XVIII granted Kléber a proper burial in his native Strasbourg.

== Prison ==
The isolated location and dangerous offshore currents of the Château d&#x27;If made it an ideal escape-proof prison, very much like the island of Alcatraz in California in more recent times. Its use as a dumping ground for political and religious detainees soon made it one of the most feared and notorious jails in France. Over 3,500 Huguenots (French Calvinist Christians) were sent to Château d&#x27;If, as was Gaston Crémieux, a leader of the Paris Commune, who was shot there in 1871.

The island became internationally famous in the 19th century, when Alexandre Dumas used it as a setting for his novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, published to widespread acclaim in 1844. In the novel, the main character Edmond Dantès (a commoner who later purchases the noble title of count) and his mentor, Abbé Faria, were both imprisoned in it. After fourteen years, Dantès makes a daring escape from the castle, becoming the first person to do so and survive. In reality, no one is known to have done this. The modern Château d&#x27;If maintains a roughly hewn dungeon in honour of Dantès as a tourist attraction.

As was common practice in those days, prisoners were treated differently according to their class and wealth. The poorest were placed at the bottom, being confined perhaps twenty or more to a cell in windowless dungeons under the castle. However, the wealthiest inmates were able to pay for their own private cells (or &quot;pistoles&quot;) higher up, with windows, a garderobe and a fireplace.

== The château today==

The château&#x27;s use as a prison ceased at the end of the 19th century. It was demilitarized and opened to the public on 23 September 1890, and can be reached by boat from Marseille&#x27;s old port. Its fame as the setting for Dumas&#x27; novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; has made the prison a popular tourist destination.

Mark Twain visited here in July 1867, during a months-long pleasure excursion. He recounts his visit in his book, &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot;. He says a guide took his party into the prison, which was not yet open to the public, and inside the cells, one of which he says housed the &quot;Iron Mask&quot;. There is a sign at the château that says &quot;Prison dite de l&#x27;Homme au Masque de Fer&quot; (&quot;Said to be the prison of the Man in the Iron Mask&quot;), but this is likely only legend since the famed Man in the Iron Mask was never held at the Château d&#x27;If.

The Château d&#x27;If is listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture.

== In fictional works ==
* The Château d&#x27;If is famous for being one of the settings of Alexandre Dumas&#x27; 1844 adventure novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;. However, other locations have been used to represent Château d&#x27;If in film adaptations of the work. In the 2002 adaptation starring Jim Caviezel, the château was represented by Saint Mary&#x27;s Tower on Comino, the smallest inhabited Maltese island. The cliff-top watchtower can be seen from the ferry crossing between Malta and Gozo.
* &quot;Chateau d&#x27;If&quot; is the title of a 1949, short story written by Jack Vance (previously published as &quot;New Bodies For Old&quot;).
* The fortress was used as the location where Alain Charnier a.k.a. Frog One (Fernando Rey) meets Devereaux (Frédéric de Pasquale) to finalize the drugs shipment to the United States in the 1971 crime film &quot;The French Connection&quot;.
* In the 1956 &quot;Tales of Old Dartmoor&quot; episode of &quot;The Goon Show&quot; radio comedy series, Grytpype-Thynne has Dartmoor Prison put to sea to visit the Château d&#x27;If, as part of a plan to find the treasure of the Count of Monte Cristo.
* In the Clive Cussler 2010 novel &quot;Spartan Gold&quot;, the main characters visit the Château d&#x27;If as part of their quest for hidden treasure.

== Notable prisoners ==
* Élie Neau, Huguenot refugee
* Philippe, Chevalier de Lorraine, lover of Philippe de France
* , accused of bringing the plague to Marseille (c. 1720 – c. 1723)
* Honoré Mirabeau, writer, popular orator and statesman (1774–1775)
* Abbé Faria, his stay at the château is disputed (1797–?)
* Michel Mathieu Lecointe-Puyraveau, politician (1815)
* Gaston Crémieux, a leader of the Paris Commune (1871)

Contrary to common belief, the Marquis de Sade was not a prisoner at the château.

<doc id="200962" wikidata="Q6453156" url="?curid=200962" title="Backstory">
<text>A backstory, background story, background, or legend is a set of events invented for a plot, preceding and leading up to that plot. In acting, it is the history of the character before the drama begins, and is created during the actor&#x27;s preparation. These terms are also used in espionage.

==Usage==
As a literary device, backstory is often employed to lend depth or believability to the main story. The usefulness of having a dramatic revelation was recognized by Aristotle, in &quot;Poetics&quot;.

Backstories are usually revealed, partially or in full, chronologically or otherwise, as the main narrative unfolds. However, a story creator may also create portions of a backstory or even an entire backstory that is solely for their own use.

Backstory may be revealed by various means, including flashbacks, dialogue, direct narration, summary, recollection, and exposition.

== Recollection ==
Recollection is the fiction-writing mode whereby a character calls something to mind, or remembers it. A character&#x27;s memory plays a role for conveying backstory, as it allows a fiction-writer to bring forth information from earlier in the story or from before the beginning of the story. Although recollection is not widely recognized as a distinct fiction-writing mode, recollection is commonly used by authors of fiction.

Orson Scott Card observed that &quot;If it&#x27;s a memory the character could have called to mind at any point, having her think about it just in time to make a key decision may seem like an implausible coincidence . . . &quot; Furthermore, &quot;If the memory is going to prompt a present decision, then the memory in turn must have been prompted by a recent event.&quot;

== Shared universe ==
In a shared universe more than one author may shape the same backstory. The later creation of a backstory that conflicts with a previously written main story may require the adjustment device known as retroactive continuity, informally known as &quot;retcon&quot;.

==Acting==
Actors may create their own backstories for characters, going beyond the sometimes meager information in a script. Filling in details helps an actor interpret the script and create fully imagined characters.

<doc id="200964" wikidata="Q1323572" url="?curid=200964" title="Reformism (historical)">
<text>Reformism is a type of social movement that aims to bring a social or also a political system closer to the community&#x27;s ideal. A reform movement is distinguished from more radical social movements such as revolutionary movements which reject those old ideals, in that the ideas are often grounded in liberalism, although they may be rooted in socialist (specifically, social democratic) or religious concepts. Some rely on personal transformation; others rely on small collectives, such as Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s spinning wheel and the self-sustaining village economy, as a mode of social change. Reactionary movements, which can arise against any of these, attempt to put things back the way they were before any successes the new reform movement(s) enjoyed, or to prevent any such successes.

== United Kingdom ==
After two decades of intensely conservative rule, the logjam broke in the late 1820s with the repeal of obsolete restrictions on Nonconformists, followed by the dramatic removal of severe limitations on Catholics in Britain.

The Radical movement campaigned for electoral reform, against child labour, for a reform of the Poor Laws, free trade, educational reform, prison reform, and public sanitation. Originally this movement sought to replace the exclusive political power of the aristocracy with a more democratic system empowering urban areas and the middle and working classes. The energy of reform emerged from the religious fervour of the evangelical element in the established Church of England, and Evangelical workers in the Nonconformist churches, especially the Methodists.

Reformers also used the scientific methodology of Jeremy Bentham and the utilitarians to design specific reforms, and especially to provide for government inspection to guarantee their successful operation. The greatest success of the Reformers was the Reform Act 1832. It gave the rising urban middle classes more political power, while sharply reducing the power of the low-population districts controlled by rich families. Despite determined resistance from the House of Lords to the bill, this act gave more parliamentary power to the liberals, while reducing the political force of the working class, leaving them detached from the main body of middle class support on which they had relied. Having achieved the Reform Act 1832, the Radical alliance was broken until the Liberal-Labour alliance of the Edwardian period.

=== Chartist movement ===
The Chartist movement in nineteenth-century Britain sought universal suffrage. A historian of the Chartist movement observed that &quot;The Chartist movement was essentially an economic movement with a purely political programme.&quot; A period of bad trade and high food prices set in, and the drastic restrictions on Poor Law relief were a source of acute distress. The London Working Men&#x27;s Association, under the guidance of Francis Place, found itself in the midst of a great unrest. In the northern textile districts the Chartists, led by Feargus O&#x27;Connor, a follower of Daniel O&#x27;Connell, denounced the inadequate Poor Laws. This was basically a hunger revolt, springing from unemployment and despair. In Birmingham, the older Birmingham Political Union sprang to life under the leadership of Thomas Attwood. The Chartist movement demanded basic economic reforms, higher wages and better conditions of work, and a repeal of the obnoxious Poor Law Act.

The idea of universal male suffrage, an initial goal of the Chartist movement, was to include all males as voters regardless of their social standing. This later evolved into a campaign for universal suffrage. This movement sought to redraw the parliamentary districts within Great Britain and create a salary system for elected officials so that workers could afford to represent their constituents without a burden on their families.

=== Women&#x27;s rights movement ===

Many consider Mary Wollstonecraft&#x27;s &quot;Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1792) to be the source of the reformers&#x27; long-running campaign for feminist inclusion and the origin of the Women&#x27;s Suffrage movement. Harriet Taylor was a significant influence on John Stuart Mill&#x27;s work and ideas, reinforcing Mill&#x27;s advocacy of women&#x27;s rights. Her essay, &quot;Enfranchisement of Women,&quot; appeared in the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; in 1851 in response to a speech by Lucy Stone given at the first National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1850, and it was reprinted in the United States. Mill cites Taylor&#x27;s influence in his final revision of &quot;On Liberty,&quot; (1859) which was published shortly after her death, and she appears to be obliquely referenced in Mill&#x27;s &quot;The Subjection of Women.&quot;

A militant campaign to include women in the electorate originated in Victorian times. Emmeline Pankhurst&#x27;s husband, Richard Pankhurst, was a supporter of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement and had been the author of the Married Women&#x27;s Property Acts of 1870 and 1882. In 1889, Pankhurst founded the unsuccessful Women&#x27;s Franchise League, and in October 1903 she founded the better-known Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (later dubbed &#x27;suffragettes&#x27; by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;), an organization famous for its militancy. Led by Pankhurst and her daughters, Christabel and Sylvia, the campaign culminated in 1918, when the British Parliament the Representation of the People Act 1918 granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who were householders, the wives of householders, occupiers of the property with an annual rent of £5, and graduates of British universities. There was also Warner&#x27;s suffrage movement.
=== Reform in Parliament ===
Earl Grey, Lord Melbourne and Robert Peel were leaders of Parliament during the earlier years of the British reform movement. Grey and Melbourne were of the Whig party, and their governments saw parliamentary reform, the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire, and Poor Law reform. Peel was a Conservative, whose Ministry took an important step in the direction of tariff reform with the abolition of the Corn Laws.
William Ewart Gladstone was a reformer. Among the reforms he helped Parliament pass was a system of public education in the Elementary Education Act 1870. In 1872, he saw the institution of a secret ballot to prevent voter coercion, trickery and bribery. By 1885, Gladstone had readjusted the parliamentary district lines by making each district equal in population, preventing one MP from having greater influence than another.

== United States: 1840s–1930s ==
* Religion – the Evangelical pietistic Protestant churches were active in numerous reforms in the mid-19th century, including temperance and the abolition of slavery. See Second Great Awakening
* Art – The Hudson River School defined a distinctive American style of art, depicting romantic landscapes via the Transcendentalist perspective on nature.
* Literature – founding of the Transcendentalist movement, which supported numerous reforms.
* Utopian experiments:
**New Harmony, Indiana (founder: Robert Owen) – practiced economic communism, although it proved to be socially flawed and thus unable to sustain itself.
** Oneida Commune (founder: John Noyes), practiced eugenics, complex marriage, and communal living. The commune was supported through the manufacture of silverware, and the corporation still exists today, producing spoons and forks for households of the world. The commune sold its assets when Noyes was jailed on numerous charges.
** Shakers – (founder: Mother Ann Lee) Stressed living and worship through dance, supported themselves through manufacture of furniture. The furniture is still popular today.
** Brook Farm (founder: George Ripley), an agriculture-based commune that also ran schools.
* Educational reform – (founder: Horace Mann); goals were a more relevant curriculum and more accessible education. Noah Webster&#x27;s dictionary standardized English spelling and language; William McGuffey&#x27;s hugely successful children&#x27;s books taught reading in incremental stages.
* Moral reform – Female movement that began in the 1830s to end prostitution and the sexual double standard. Groups, such as the New York Female Moral Reform Society, were organized by women in the Northeast. These moral reform societies published magazines and journals to spread their message. By 1841 there were about 50,000 women in 616 local moral reform societies in the North.

*Women&#x27;s rights movement – Founded by Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton who organized the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 and published a Declaration of Sentiments calling for the social and legal equality of women. Carried forward by Lucy Stone who began speaking out for women&#x27;s rights in 1847, and organized a series of national conventions. Susan B. Anthony joined the cause in 1851 and worked ceaselessly for women&#x27;s suffrage.
* American labor movement – The campaign against excessive hours of work (and for the eight-hour day) was a central issue for the labor movement during the 19th century. The Knights of Labor, organized among the skilled trades in 1869 and led by Uriah Stephens, Terence Powderly and Mother Jones, was succeeded by the American Federation of Labor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (combined now as the AFL–CIO), and the Industrial Workers of the World.
* Child labor reform – Lewis Hine used his camera as a tool for social reform. His photographs were instrumental in changing child labor laws in the United States.
* Abolition movement – The addition of Mexico&#x27;s former territories in 1848 at the conclusion of the Mexican–American War reopened the possibility of the expansion of race-based chattel slavery; the adaptation of the slave system to industrial-style cotton production resulted in increasing dehumanization of black workers and a backlash against slavery in the northern states; key figures included William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass.
* Know-Nothing movement, also anti-Catholic, anti-Masonic, and nativist (1845–1856)
* Prohibition or Temperance movement – Characterized by Frances Willard&#x27;s Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, which stressed education (formed 1881, declined in 1940s) and Carrie Nation&#x27;s Anti-Saloon League (established nationally by Howard Hyde Russell), which promoted a confrontational approach towards bars and saloons. Other significant organizations include the Prohibition Party and Lincoln-Lee Legion.

== Mexico: La Reforma, 1850s ==
The Mexican Liberal Party, led by Benito Juárez and Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, guided the emergence of Mexico, as a nation state, from colonialism. It envisioned a modern civil society and capitalist economy. All citizens were equal before the law, and Mexico&#x27;s 1829 abolition of slavery was reaffirmed. The Liberal program, documented in the 1857 Constitution of Mexico, was based on:
* Abolition of the &quot;fueros&quot; which had granted civil immunity to members of the church and military
* Liquidation of traditional &quot;ejido&quot; communal land holdings and distribution of freehold titles to the peasantry (the Ley Lerdo)
* Expropriation and sale of concentrated church property holdings (beyond the clergy&#x27;s religious needs)
* Curtailment of exorbitant fees by the church for administering the sacraments
* Abolition of separate military and religious courts (the Ley Juárez)
* Freedom of religion and guarantees of many civil and political liberties
* Secular public education
* Civil registry for births, marriages and deaths
* Elimination of all forms of cruel and unusual punishment, including the death penalty
* Elimination of debtor&#x27;s prisons and all forms of personal servitude

== Ottoman Empire: 1840s–1870s ==

The Tanzimat, meaning &quot;reorganization&quot; of the Ottoman Empire, was a period of reformation that began in 1839 and ended with the First Constitutional Era in 1876. The Tanzimat reform era was characterized by various attempts to modernize the Ottoman Empire, to secure its territorial integrity against nationalist movements and aggressive powers. The reforms encouraged Ottomanism among the diverse ethnic groups of the Empire, attempting to stem the tide of nationalist movements within the Ottoman Empire. The reforms attempted to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into Ottoman society by enhancing their civil liberties and granting them equality throughout the Empire. Peasants often opposed the reforms because they upset traditional relationships.

== Russia 1860s ==
The Russian Empire in the 19th century was characterized by very conservative and reactionary policies issued by the autocratic tsars. The great exception came during the reign of Alexander II (1855–1881), especially the 1860s. By far the greatest and most unexpected was the abolition of serfdom, which affected 23 million of the Empire&#x27;s population of 74 million. They belonged to the state, to monasteries and to 104,000 rich gentry landowners. `

===Emancipation of the serfs 1861===
The emancipation reform of 1861 that freed the 23 million serfs was the single most important event in 19th-century Russia and the beginning of the end for the landed aristocracy&#x27;s monopoly of power. Emancipation brought a supply of free labour to the cities, stimulating industry, and allowed the middle class to increase in number and influence. The freed peasants did not receive any free land. They had to pay a special tax for what amounted to their lifetime to the government, which in turn paid the landlords a generous price for the land that they had lost. All the property turned over to the peasants was owned collectively by the &quot;mir&quot;, the village community, which divided the land among the peasants and supervised the various holdings. Although serfdom was abolished, since its abolition was achieved on terms unfavourable to the peasants, revolutionary tensions were not abated, despite Alexander II&#x27;s intentions. Revolutionaries believed that the newly freed serfs were merely being sold into wage slavery in the onset of the industrial revolution, and that the bourgeoisie had effectively replaced landowners.

===Judicial reforms===

The judicial reforms were among the most successful and consistent of all his reforms. A completely new court system and order of legal proceedings were established. The main results were the introduction of a unified judicial system instead of a cumbersome set of estates of the realm courts, and fundamental changes in criminal trials. The latter included the establishment of the principle of equality of the parties involved, the introduction of public hearings, the jury trial, and a professional advocate that had never existed in Russia. However, there were also problems, as certain obsolete institutions were not covered by the reform. Also, the reform was hindered by extrajudicial punishment, introduced on a widespread scale during the reigns of his successors – Alexander III and Nicholas II. One of the most important results of the reform was wide introduction of jury trials. The jury trial included three professional judges and twelve jurors. A juror had to possess real estate of a certain value. Unlike in modern jury trials, jurors not only could decide whether the defendant was guilty or not guilty but also could decide that the defendant was guilty but not to be punished, as Alexander II believed that justice without morality is wrong. The sentence was rendered by professional judges.

===Additional reforms===
A host of new reforms followed in diverse areas. The tsar appointed Dmitry Milyutin to carry out significant reforms in the Russian armed forces. Further important changes were made concerning industry and commerce, and the new freedom thus afforded produced a large number of limited liability companies. Plans were formed for building a great network of railways, partly to develop the natural resources of the country, and partly to increase its power for defense and attack.

Military reforms included universal conscription, introduced for all social classes on 1 January 1874.

A new judicial administration (1864), based on the French model, introduced security of tenure. A new penal code and a greatly simplified system of civil and criminal procedure also came into operation. Reorganisation of the judiciary occurred to include trial in open court, with judges appointed for life, a jury system and the creation of justices of the peace to deal with minor offences at local level. Legal historian Sir Henry Maine credited Alexander II with the first great attempt since the time of Grotius to codify and humanise the usages of war.

Alexander&#x27;s bureaucracy instituted an elaborate scheme of local self-government (zemstvo) for the rural districts (1864) and the large towns (1870), with elective assemblies possessing a restricted right of taxation, and a new rural and municipal police under the direction of the Minister of the Interior.

The Alaska colony was losing money, and would be impossible to defend and wartime against Britain, so in 1867 Russia sold Alaska to the United States for $7.2 million (equivalent to roughly $200 million in current dollars). The Russian administrators, soldiers, settlers, and some of the priests returned home. Others stayed to minister to their native parishioners, who remain members of the Russian Orthodox Church into the 21st century.

== Turkey: 1920s–1930s ==

Atatürk&#x27;s Reforms were a series of significant political, legal, cultural, social and economic changes that were implemented under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in the 1920s and 1930s in the new Republic of Turkey

In the years between 1919 and 1923 Mustafa Kemal was at the forefront of the Turkish War of Independence and involved with the eradication of the antiquated institutions of the Osmanic Empire and in laying the foundations of the new Turkish State. He approached the National Congresses of Erzurum and Sivas to organise and lift the morale of the people in its determined opposition to the Forces of the Entente who were occupying Anatolia. By the end of these conventions he had managed to convey the message that the idea and the ideals of outdated imperialism ought be dropped so that people within the national boundaries could make decisions in accordance with the principles and general guidelines of an effective national policy. After the occupation of Istanbul by the Forces of the Entente he laid the foundations for the new Turkish State when in 1920 he united the Great National Assembly in Ankara. With the government of the Great National Assembly, of which he was president, Mustafa Kemal fought the Forces of the Entente and the Sultan&#x27;s army which had remained there in collaboration with the occupying forces. Finally, on 9 September 1922 he succeeded in driving the American Forces back to Izmir, along with the other forces which had managed to penetrate the heartland of Anatolia. By this action he saved the country from invasion by foreign forces.

<text>Tecumseh ( ; October 5, 1813) was a Shawnee chief and warrior who promoted resistance to the expansion of the United States onto Native American lands. A persuasive orator, Tecumseh traveled widely, forming a Native American confederacy and promoting intertribal unity. Even though his efforts to unite Native Americans ended with his death in the War of 1812, he became an iconic folk hero in American, Indigenous, and Canadian popular history.

Tecumseh was born in what is now Ohio at a time when the far-flung Shawnees were reuniting in their Ohio Country homeland. During his childhood, the Shawnees lost territory to the expanding American colonies in a series of border conflicts. Tecumseh&#x27;s father was killed in battle against American colonists in 1774. Tecumseh was thereafter mentored by his older brother Cheeseekau, a noted war chief who died fighting Americans in 1792. As a young war leader, Tecumseh joined Shawnee Chief Blue Jacket&#x27;s armed struggle against further American encroachment, which ended in defeat at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794 and with the loss of most of Ohio in the 1795 Treaty of Greenville.

In 1805, Tecumseh&#x27;s younger brother Tenskwatawa, who came to be known as the Shawnee Prophet, founded a religious movement that called upon Native Americans to reject European influences and return to a more traditional lifestyle. In 1808, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa established Prophetstown, a village in present-day Indiana, that grew into a large, multi-tribal community. Tecumseh traveled constantly, spreading the Prophet&#x27;s message and eclipsing his brother in prominence. Tecumseh proclaimed that Native Americans owned their lands in common and urged tribes not to cede more territory unless all agreed. His message alarmed American leaders as well as Native leaders who sought accommodation with the United States. In 1811, when Tecumseh was in the South recruiting allies, Americans under William Henry Harrison defeated Tenskwatawa at the Battle of Tippecanoe and destroyed Prophetstown.

In the War of 1812, Tecumseh joined his cause with the British, recruited warriors, and helped capture Detroit in August 1812. The following year he led an unsuccessful campaign against the United States in Ohio and Indiana. When U.S. naval forces took control of Lake Erie in 1813, Tecumseh reluctantly retreated with the British into Upper Canada, where American troops led by Richard Mentor Johnson engaged them at the Battle of the Thames on October 5, 1813, in which Tecumseh was killed. His death caused his confederacy to collapse. The lands he had fought to defend were eventually ceded to the U.S. government. His legacy as one of the most celebrated Native Americans in history grew in the years after his death, although details of his life have often been obscured by mythology.

==Early life==

Tecumseh was born in Shawnee territory in what is now Ohio between 1764 and 1771. The best evidence suggests a birthdate of around March 1768. 

The Shawnee pronunciation of his name has traditionally been rendered by non-Shawnee sources as &quot;Tecumthé&quot;. He was born into the Panther clan of the Kispoko division of the Shawnee tribe. Like most Shawnees, his name indicated his clan: translations of his name from the Shawnee language include &quot;I Cross the Way&quot;, and &quot;Shooting Star&quot;, references to a meteor associated with the Panther clan. 

Later stories claimed that Tecumseh was named after a shooting star that appeared at his birth, although his father and most of his siblings, as members of the Panther clan, were named after the same meteor.

Tecumseh was likely born in the Shawnee town of Chillicothe, in the Scioto River valley, near present-day Chillicothe, Ohio, or in a nearby Kispoko village. Tecumseh&#x27;s father, Puckeshinwau, was a Shawnee war chief of the Kispoko division. Tecumseh&#x27;s mother, Methoataaskee, probably belonged to the Pekowi division and the Turtle clan, although some traditions maintain that she was Muscogee. His mother may have been a blood relative of William Weatherford. Tecumseh was the fifth of eight children. His parents met and married in what is now Alabama, where many Shawnees had settled after being driven out of the Ohio Country by the Iroquois in the 17th-century Beaver Wars. Around 1759, Puckeshinwau and Methoataaskee moved to the Ohio Country as part of a Shawnee effort to reunite in their traditional homeland.

In 1763, the British Empire laid claim to the Ohio Country following its victory in the French and Indian War. That year, Cheeseekau took part in Pontiac&#x27;s War, a pan-tribal effort to counter British control of the region. Tecumseh was born in the peaceful decade after Pontiac&#x27;s War, a time when Puckeshinwau likely became the chief of the Kispoko town on the Scioto. In a 1768 treaty, the Iroquois ceded land south of the Ohio River (including present-day Kentucky) to the British, a region the Shawnee and other tribes used for hunting. Shawnees attempted to organize further resistance against colonial occupation of the region, culminating in the 1774 Battle of Point Pleasant, in which Puckeshinwau was killed. After the battle, Shawnees ceded Kentucky to the colonists.

When the American Revolutionary War between the British and their American colonies began in 1775, many Shawnees allied themselves with the British, raiding into Kentucky with the aim of driving out American settlers. Tecumseh, too young to fight, was among those forced to relocate in the face of American counterraids. In 1777, his family moved from the Scioto River to a Kispoko town on the Mad River, near present-day Springfield, Ohio. General George Rogers Clark, commander of the Kentucky militia, led a major expedition into Shawnee territory in 1780. Tecumseh may have witnessed the ensuing Battle of Piqua on August 8. After the Shawnees retreated, Clark burned their villages and crops. The Shawnees relocated to the northwest, along the Great Miami River, but Clark returned in 1782 and destroyed those villages as well, forcing the Shawnees to retreat further north, near present-day Bellefontaine, Ohio.

==From warrior to chief==
After the American Revolutionary War ended in 1783, the United States claimed the lands north of the Ohio River by right of conquest; Britain had renounced its claims to the area in the Treaty of Paris. In response, Indians convened a great intertribal conference at Lower Sandusky in the summer of 1783. Speakers, most notably Joseph Brant of the Mohawk, argued that Indians must unite to hold onto their lands. They put forth a doctrine that Indian lands were held in common by all tribes, and so no further land should be ceded to the United States without the consent of all the tribes. This idea made a strong impression on Tecumseh, who was just fifteen years old when he attended the conference. As an adult, he would become such a well-known advocate of this policy that some mistakenly thought it had originated with him. The United States, however, insisted on dealing with the tribes individually, getting each to sign separate land treaties. In January 1786, Moluntha, civil chief of the Mekoche Shawnee division, signed the Treaty of Fort Finney, surrendering most of Ohio to the Americans. Later that year, Moluntha was murdered by a Kentucky militiaman, initiating a new border war.

Tecumseh, now about eighteen years old, became a warrior under the tutelage of his older brother Cheeseekau, who emerged as a noted war chief. Tecumseh participated in attacks on flatboats traveling down the Ohio River, carrying waves of immigrants into lands the Shawnees had lost. He was disturbed by the sight of prisoners being cruelly treated by the Shawnees, an early indication of his lifelong aversion to torture and cruelty, for which he would later be celebrated. In 1788, Tecumseh, Cheeseekau and their family moved westward, relocating near Cape Girardeau, Missouri. They hoped to be free of American settlers, only to find colonists moving there as well, so they did not stay long.

In late 1789 or early 1790, Tecumseh traveled south with Cheeseekau to live with the Chickamauga Cherokees near Lookout Mountain in what is now Tennessee. Some Shawnees already lived among the Chickamaugas, who were fierce opponents of U.S. expansion. Cheeseekau led about forty Shawnees in raids against colonists; Tecumseh was presumably among them. During his nearly two years among the Chickamaugas, Tecumseh probably had a daughter with a Cherokee woman; the relationship was brief, and the child remained with her mother.

In 1791, Tecumseh returned to the Ohio Country to take part in the Northwest Indian War as a minor leader. The Native confederacy that had been formed to fight the war was led by the Shawnee Blue Jacket, and would provide a model for the confederacy Tecumseh created years later. He led a band of eight followers, including his younger brother Lalawéthika, later known as Tenskwatawa. Tecumseh missed fighting in a major Indian victory (St. Clair&#x27;s defeat) on November 4 because he was hunting or scouting at the time. The following year he participated in other skirmishes before rejoining Cheeseekau in Tennessee. Tecumseh was with Cheeseekau when he was killed in an unsuccessful attack on Buchanan&#x27;s Station near Nashville in 1792. Tecumseh probably sought revenge for his brother&#x27;s death, but the details are unknown. During this time, he was somewhat known as &quot;an eloquent speaker&quot; among Native Americans, and this reputation would follow him for the rest of his life as he grew in prominence.

Tecumseh returned to the Ohio Country at the end of 1792 and fought in several more skirmishes. In 1794, he fought in the Battle of Fallen Timbers, a bitter defeat for the Indians. The Native confederacy fell apart, especially after Blue Jacket agreed to make peace with the Americans. Tecumseh did not attend the signing of the Treaty of Greenville (1795), in which about two-thirds of Ohio and portions of present-day Indiana were ceded to the United States.

By 1796, Tecumseh was both the civil and war chief of a Kispoko band of about 50 warriors and 250 people. His sister Tecumapease was the band&#x27;s principal female chief. Tecumseh took a wife, Mamate, and had a son, Paukeesaa, born about 1796. Their marriage did not last, and Tecumapease raised Paukeesaa from the age of seven or eight. Tecumseh&#x27;s band moved to various locations before settling in 1798 close to Delaware Indians, along the White River near present-day Anderson, Indiana, where he lived for the next eight years. He married twice more during this time. His third marriage, to White Wing, lasted until 1807.

==Rise of the Prophet==
While Tecumseh lived along the White River, Native Americans in the region were troubled by sickness, alcoholism, poverty, the loss of land, depopulation, and the decline of their traditional way of life. Several religious prophets emerged, each offering explanations and remedies for the crisis. Among these was Tecumseh&#x27;s younger brother Lalawéthika, a healer in Tecumseh&#x27;s village. Until this time, Lalawéthika had been regarded as a misfit with little promise. In 1805, he began preaching, drawing upon ideas espoused by earlier prophets, particularly the Delaware prophet Neolin. Lalawéthika urged listeners to reject European influences, stop drinking alcohol, and discard their traditional medicine bags. Tecumseh followed his brother&#x27;s teachings by eating only Native food, wearing traditional Shawnee clothing, and not drinking alcohol.

In 1806, Tecumseh and Lalawéthika, now known as the Shawnee Prophet, established a new town near the ruins of Fort Greenville (present-day Greenville, Ohio), where the 1795 Treaty of Greenville had been signed. The Prophet&#x27;s message spread widely, attracting visitors and converts from multiple tribes. The brothers hoped to reunite the scattered Shawnees at Greenville, but they were opposed by Black Hoof, a Mekoche chief regarded by Americans as the &quot;principal chief&quot; of the Shawnees. Black Hoof and other leaders around the Shawnee town of Wapakoneta urged Shawnees to accommodate the United States by adopting some American customs, with the goal of creating a Shawnee homeland with secure borders in northern Ohio. The Prophet&#x27;s movement represented a challenge to the Shawnee chiefs who sat on the tribal council at Wapakoneta. Most Ohio Shawnees followed Black Hoof&#x27;s path and rejected the Prophet&#x27;s movement. Important converts who joined the movement at Greenville were Blue Jacket, the famed Shawnee war leader, and Roundhead, who became Tecumseh&#x27;s close friend and ally.

American settlers grew uneasy as Indians flocked to Greenville. In 1806 and 1807, Tecumseh and Blue Jacket traveled to Chillicothe, the capital of the new U.S. state of Ohio, to reassure the governor that Greenville posed no threat. Rumors of war between the United States and Great Britain followed the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; incident of June 1807. To escape the rising tensions, Tecumseh and the Prophet decided to move west to a more secure location, farther from American forts and closer to potential western Indian allies.

In 1808, Tecumseh and the Prophet established a village Americans would call Prophetstown, north of present-day Lafayette, Indiana. The Prophet adopted a new name, Tenskwatawa (&quot;The Open Door&quot;), meaning he was the door through which followers could reach salvation. Like Greenville, Prophetstown attracted numerous followers, comprising Shawnees, Potawatomis, Kickapoos, Winnebagos, Sauks, Ottawas, Wyandots, and Iowas, an unprecedented variety of Natives living together. Perhaps 6,000 people settled in the area, making it larger than any American city in the region. Jortner (2011) argues that Prophetstown was effectively an independent city-state.

At Prophetstown, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa initially worked to maintain a peaceful coexistence with the United States. A major turning point came in September 1809, when William Henry Harrison, governor of the Indiana Territory, negotiated the Treaty of Fort Wayne, purchasing of land in what is present-day Indiana and Illinois. Although many Indian leaders signed the treaty, others who used the land were deliberately excluded from the negotiations. The treaty created widespread outrage among Indians, and, according to historian John Sugden, &quot;put Tecumseh on the road to war&quot; with the United States.

==Forming a confederacy==

Before the Treaty of Fort Wayne, Tecumseh was relatively unknown to outsiders, who usually referred to him as &quot;the Prophet&#x27;s brother.&quot; Afterwards he emerged as a prominent figure as he built an intertribal confederacy to counter U.S. expansion. In August 1810, Tecumseh met with William Henry Harrison at Vincennes, capital of the Indiana Territory, a standoff that became legendary. Tecumseh demanded that Harrison rescind the Fort Wayne cession, and said he would oppose American settlement on the disputed lands. He said the chiefs who had signed the treaty would be punished, and that he was uniting the tribes to prevent further cessions. Harrison insisted the land had been purchased fairly and that Tecumseh had no right to object because Native Americans did not own land in common. Harrison said he would send Tecumseh&#x27;s demands to President James Madison, but did not expect the president to accept them. As the meeting concluded, Tecumseh said that if Madison did not rescind the Fort Wayne treaty, &quot;you and I will have to fight it out.&quot;

After the confrontation with Harrison, Tecumseh traveled widely to build his confederacy. He went westward to recruit allies among the Potawatomis, Winnebagos, Sauks, Foxes, Kickapoos, and Missouri Shawnees. In November 1810, he visited Fort Malden in Upper Canada to ask British officials for assistance in the coming war, but the British were noncommittal, urging restraint. In May 1811, Tecumseh visited Ohio to recruit warriors among the Shawnees, Wyandots, and Senecas. After returning to Prophetstown, he sent a delegation to the Iroquois in New York.

In July 1811, Tecumseh again met Harrison at Vincennes. He told the governor he had amassed a confederacy of northern tribes and was heading south to do the same. For the next six months, Tecumseh traveled some in the south and west to recruit allies. The documentary evidence of this journey is fragmentary, and was exaggerated in folklore, but he probably met with Chickasaws, Choctaws, Muscogee, Osages, western Shawnees and Delawares, Iowas, Sauks, Foxes, Sioux, Kickapoos, and Potawatomis. He was aided in his efforts by two extraordinary events: the Great Comet of 1811 and the New Madrid earthquake, which he and other Native Americans interpreted as omens that his confederacy should be supported. Many rejected his overtures, especially in the south, most notably the Choctaws and Chickasaws; his most receptive southern listeners were among the Muscogee. A faction among the Muscogee, who became known as the Red Sticks, responded to Tecumseh&#x27;s call to arms, contributing to the coming of the Creek War.

According to Sugden (1997), Tecumseh had made a &quot;serious mistake&quot; by informing Harrison he would be absent from Prophetstown for an extended time. Harrison wrote that Tecumseh&#x27;s absence &quot;affords a most favorable opportunity for breaking up his Confederacy.&quot; In September 1811, Harrison marched toward Prophetstown with about 1,000 men. In the pre-dawn hours on November 7, warriors from Prophetstown launched a surprise attack on Harrison&#x27;s camp, initiating the Battle of Tippecanoe. Harrison&#x27;s men held their ground, after which the Prophet&#x27;s warriors withdrew and evacuated Prophetstown. The Americans burned the village the following day and returned to Vincennes.

Historians have traditionally viewed the Battle of Tippecanoe as a devastating blow to Tecumseh&#x27;s confederacy. According to a story recorded by Benjamin Drake ten years after the battle, Tecumseh was furious with Tenskwatawa after the battle and threatened to kill him. Afterwards, it was said, the Prophet played little part in the confederacy&#x27;s leadership. Modern scholarship has cast doubt on this interpretation. Dowd (1992), Cave (2002), and Jortner (2011) argued that stories of Tenskwatawa&#x27;s disgrace originated with Harrison&#x27;s allies and are not supported by other sources. According to this view, the battle was a setback for Tenskwatawa, but he continued to serve as the confederacy&#x27;s spiritual leader, with Tecumseh as its diplomat and military leader.

Harrison hoped his preemptive strike would subdue Tecumseh&#x27;s confederacy, but a wave of frontier violence erupted after the battle. Native Americans, many who had fought at Tippecanoe, sought revenge, killing as many as 46 Americans. Tecumseh sought to restrain warriors from premature action while preparing the confederacy for future hostilities. By the time the United States declared war on Great Britain in June 1812, as many as 800 warriors had gathered around the rebuilt Prophetstown. Tecumseh&#x27;s Native American allies throughout the Northwest Territory numbered around 3,500 warriors.

==War of 1812==

In June 1812, Tecumseh arrived at Fort Malden in Amherstburg to join his cause with the British in the War of 1812. The British had few troops and scant resources in the west, so Native allies were essential to the defense of Upper Canada. The British quickly recognized Tecumseh as the most influential of their Indian allies and relied upon him to direct the Native forces. He and his warriors scouted and probed enemy positions as American General William Hull crossed into Canada and threatened to take Fort Malden. On July 25, Tecumseh&#x27;s warriors skirmished with Americans north of Amherstburg, inflicting the first American fatalities of the war.

Tecumseh turned his attention to cutting off Hull&#x27;s supply and communication lines on the U.S. side of the border, south of Detroit. On August 5, he led 25 warriors in two successive ambushes, scattering a far superior force. Tecumseh captured Hull&#x27;s outgoing mail, which revealed that the general was fearful of being cut off. On August 9, Tecumseh joined with British soldiers at the Battle of Maguaga, successfully thwarting Hull&#x27;s attempt to reopen his line of communications. Two days later, Hull pulled the last of his men from Amherstburg, ending his attempt to invade Canada.

===Brock and the Siege of Detroit===
On August 14, Major-General Isaac Brock, British commander of Upper Canada, arrived at Fort Malden and began preparations for attacking Hull at Fort Detroit. Tecumseh, upon hearing of Brock&#x27;s plans, reportedly turned to his companions and said, &quot;This is a man!&quot; Tecumseh and Brock &quot;formed an immediate friendship that served to cement the alliance.&quot; Brock&#x27;s high esteem for Tecumseh likely contributed to a popular belief that Tecumseh was appointed a brigadier general in the British Army, though this is a myth.

Tecumseh led about 530 warriors in the Siege of Detroit. According to one account, Tecumseh had his men repeatedly pass through an opening in the woods to create the impression that thousands of Native Americans were outside the fort, a story that may be apocryphal. To almost everyone&#x27;s astonishment, Hull decided to surrender on August 16.

Afterwards, Brock wrote of Tecumseh:He who attracted most of my attention was a Shawnee chief, Tecumset [&quot;sic&quot;], brother to the Prophet, who for the last two years has carried on, contrary to our remonstrances, an active warfare against the United States. A more sagacious or a more gallant warrior does not I believe exist. He was the admiration of every one who conversed with him.

Brock likely assured Tecumseh that the British would support Native American land claims. He wrote his superiors that restoration of land &quot;fraudulently usurped&quot; from the Native Americans should be considered in any peace treaty. News of Detroit&#x27;s capture revived British discussion of creating of an Indian barrier state to ensure the security of Upper Canada. After his short stay in the area, Brock returned to the Niagara frontier, where he was killed in action several weeks later. Meanwhile, the British had negotiated a temporary armistice and called off further offensives. Tecumseh was frustrated by the unexpected British-American armistice, which came at a time when his confederacy was attacking other American forts and needed British support. In September 1812, he and Roundhead led 600 warriors to assist in an attack on Fort Wayne, but the siege failed before they arrived. Another siege against Fort Harrison also failed. Tecumseh stayed in the Prophetstown region for the remainder of 1812, coordinating Native American war efforts.

===Fort Meigs===

Tecumseh returned to Amherstburg in April 1813. Meanwhile, the Americans, having suffered defeat at the Battle of Frenchtown in January 1813, were pushing back toward Detroit under the command of William Henry Harrison. Tecumseh and Roundhead led about 1,200 warriors to Fort Meigs, a recently constructed American fort along the Maumee River in Ohio. The Indians initially saw little action while British forces under General Henry Procter laid siege to the fort. Fighting outside the fort began on May 5 after the arrival of American reinforcements, who attacked the British gun batteries. Tecumseh led an attack on an American sortie from the fort, then crossed the river to help defeat a regiment of Kentucky militia. The British and Native Americans had inflicted heavy casualties on the Americans outside the fort, but failed to capture it. Procter&#x27;s Canadian militia and many of Tecumseh&#x27;s warriors left after the battle, so Procter was compelled to lift the siege.

One of the most famous incidents in Tecumseh&#x27;s life occurred after the battle. American prisoners had been taken to the nearby ruins of Fort Miami. When a group of Indians began killing prisoners, Tecumseh rushed in and stopped the slaughter. According to Sugden (1997), &quot;Tecumseh&#x27;s defense of the American prisoners became a cornerstone of his legend, the ultimate proof of his inherent nobility.&quot; Some accounts said Tecumseh rebuked General Procter for failing to protect the prisoners, though this might not have happened.

Tecumseh and Procter returned to Fort Meigs in July 1813, Tecumseh with 2,500 warriors, the largest contingent he would ever lead. They had little hope of taking the strongly defended fort, but Tecumseh sought to draw the Americans into open battle. He staged a mock battle within earshot of the fort, hoping the Americans would ride out to assist. The ruse failed and the second siege of Fort Meigs was lifted. Procter then led a detachment to attack Fort Stephenson on the Sandusky River, while Tecumseh went west to intercept potential American advances. Procter&#x27;s attack failed and the expedition returned to Amherstburg.

===Death and aftermath===
Tecumseh hoped further offensives were forthcoming, but after the American naval victory in the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10, 1813, Procter decided to retreat from Amherstburg. Tecumseh pleaded with Procter to stay and fight: &quot;Our lives are in the hands of the Great Spirit. We are determined to defend our lands, and if it is his will, we wish to leave our bones upon them.&quot; Procter insisted the defense of Amherstburg was untenable now that the Americans controlled Lake Erie, but he promised to make a stand at Chatham, along the Thames River. Tecumseh reluctantly agreed. The British burned Fort Malden and public buildings in Amherstburg, then began the retreat, with William Henry Harrison&#x27;s army in pursuit.

Tecumseh arrived at Chatham to find that Procter had retreated even further upriver. Procter sent word that he had chosen to make a stand near Moraviantown. Tecumseh was angered by the change in plans, but he led a rearguard action at Chatham to slow the American advance, and was slightly wounded in the arm. Many of Tecumseh&#x27;s despairing allies deserted during the retreat, leaving him 500 warriors. Procter and Tecumseh, outnumbered more than three-to-one, faced the Americans at the Battle of the Thames on October 5. Tecumseh positioned his men in a line of trees along the right, hoping to flank the Americans. The left, commanded by Procter, collapsed almost immediately, and Procter fled the battlefield. Colonel Richard Mentor Johnson led the American charge against the Indians. Tecumseh was killed in the fierce fighting, and the Indians dispersed. The Americans had won a decisive victory.
After the battle, American soldiers stripped and scalped Tecumseh&#x27;s body. The next day, when Tecumseh&#x27;s body had been positively identified, others peeled off some skin as souvenirs. The location of his remains is unknown. The earliest account stated that his body had been taken by Canadians and buried at Sandwich. Later stories said he was buried at the battlefield, or that his body was secretly removed and buried elsewhere. According to another tradition, an Ojibwe named Oshahwahnoo, who had fought at Moraviantown, exhumed Tecumseh&#x27;s body in the 1860s and buried him on St. Anne Island on the St. Clair River. In 1931, these bones were examined. Tecumseh had broken a thighbone in a riding accident as a youth and thereafter walked with a limp, but neither thigh of this skeleton had been broken. Nevertheless, in 1941 the remains were buried on nearby Walpole Island in a ceremony honoring Tecumseh. St-Denis (2005), in a book-length investigation of the topic, concluded that Tecumseh was likely buried on the battlefield and his remains have been lost.

Initial published accounts identified Richard Mentor Johnson as having killed Tecumseh. In 1816, another account claimed a different soldier had fired the fatal shot. The matter became controversial in the 1830s when Johnson was a candidate for Vice President of the United States to Martin Van Buren. Johnson&#x27;s supporters promoted him as Tecumseh&#x27;s killer, employing slogans such as &quot;Rumpsey dumpsey, rumpsey dumpsey, Colonel Johnson killed Tecumseh.&quot; Johnson&#x27;s opponents collected testimony contradicting this claim; numerous other possibilities were named. Sugden (1985) presented the evidence and argued that Johnson&#x27;s claim was the strongest, though not conclusive. Johnson became Vice President in 1837, his fame largely based on his claim to have killed Tecumseh.

Tecumseh&#x27;s death led to the collapse of his confederacy; except in the southern Creek War, most of his followers did little more fighting. In the negotiations that ended the War of 1812, the British attempted to honor promises made to Tecumseh by insisting upon the creation of a Native American barrier state in the Old Northwest. The Americans refused and the matter was dropped. The Treaty of Ghent (1814) called for Native American lands to be restored to their 1811 boundaries, something the United States had no intention of doing. By the end of the 1830s, the U.S. government had compelled Shawnees still living in Ohio to sign removal treaties and move west of the Mississippi River.

==Legacy==

Tecumseh was widely admired in his lifetime, even by Americans who had fought against him. His primary American foe, William Henry Harrison, described Tecumseh as &quot;one of those uncommon geniuses, which spring up occasionally to produce revolutions and overturn the established order of things.&quot; After his death, he became an iconic folk hero in American, Indigenous, and Canadian history. For many Native Americans in the United States and First Nations people in Canada, he became a hero who transcends tribal identity. Tecumseh&#x27;s stature grew over the decades after his death, often at the expense of Tenskwatawa, whose religious views white writers found alien and unappealing. White writers tended to turn Tecumseh into a &quot;secular&quot; leader who only used his brother&#x27;s religious movement for political reasons. For many Europeans and white North Americans, he became the foremost example of the &quot;noble savage&quot; stereotype.

Tecumseh is honored in Canada as a hero who played a major role in Canada&#x27;s defense in the War of 1812, joining Sir Isaac Brock and Laura Secord as the best-remembered people of that war. John Richardson, an important early Canadian novelist, had served with Tecumseh and idolized him. His 1828 epic poem &quot;Tecumseh; or, The Warrior of the West&quot; was intended to &quot;preserve the memory of one of the noblest and most gallant spirits&quot; in history. Canadian writers such as Charles Mair (&quot;Tecumseh: A Drama&quot;, 1886) celebrated Tecumseh as a Canadian patriot, an idea reflected in numerous subsequent biographies written for Canadian school children. The portrayal of Tecumseh as a Canadian patriot has been criticized for obscuring his true aim of protecting Native homelands outside of Canada. Among the many things named for Tecumseh in Canada are the naval reserve unit HMCS &quot;Tecumseh&quot; and the towns of Tecumseh in Southwestern Ontario and New Tecumseth in Central Ontario. In 1931, the Canadian government designated Tecumseh as a person of national historic significance.

Tecumseh has long been admired in Germany, especially due to popular novels by Fritz Steuben, beginning with &quot;The Flying Arrow&quot; (1930). Steuben used Tecumseh to promote Nazism, though later editions of his novels removed the Nazi elements. An East German film, &quot;Tecumseh&quot;, was released in 1972.

In the United States, Tecumseh became a legendary figure, the historical details of his life shrouded in mythology. According to &quot;Edmunds (2007)&quot;, &quot;the real Tecumseh has been overshadowed by a folk hero whose exploits combine the best of fact and fiction.&quot; Only in the late 20th century did academic historians begin to unravel fact from fiction. The fictional Tecumseh has been featured in poems, plays, and novels, movies, and outdoor dramas. Examples include George Jones&#x27;s &quot;Tecumseh; or, The Prophet of the West&quot; (1844 play), Mary Catherine Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Love Thrives in War&quot; (1903 novel), &quot;Brave Warrior&quot; (1952 film), and Allan W. Eckert&#x27;s &quot;A Sorrow in Our Hearts: The Life of Tecumseh&quot; (1992 novel). James Alexander Thom&#x27;s 1989 novel &quot;Panther in the Sky&quot; was made into a TV movie, &quot;&quot; (1995). The outdoor drama &quot;Tecumseh!&quot; has been performed near Chillicothe, Ohio, since 1973. Written by Allan Eckert, the story features a fictional, doomed romance between Tecumseh and a white settler woman, an example of the &quot;vanishing Indian&quot; scenario popular with white Americans. William Tecumseh Sherman, a Union general during the American Civil War, was also named after Tecumseh.

In 2024, the main-belt asteroid was named in his honor. Also in 2024, Firaxis Games worked with chief Ben Barnes and other members of the Shawnee Tribe to create a historically accurate depiction of Tecumseh in the video game &quot;Civilization VII&quot;.

<doc id="200971" wikidata="Q80362" url="?curid=200971" title="Black kite">
<text>The black kite (Milvus migrans) is a medium-sized bird of prey in the family Accipitridae, which also includes many other diurnal raptors. It is thought to be the world&#x27;s most abundant species of Accipitridae, although some populations have experienced dramatic declines or fluctuations. Current global population estimates run up to 6.7 million individuals.

Unlike others of the group, black kites are opportunistic hunters and are more likely to scavenge. They spend much time soaring and gliding in thermals in search of food. Their angled wing and distinctive forked tail make them easy to identify. They are also with a shrill whinnying call.

The black kite is widely distributed through the temperate and tropical parts of Eurasia and parts of Australasia and Oceania, with the temperate region populations tending to be migratory. Several subspecies are recognized and formerly had their own English names. The European populations are small, but the South Asian population is very large.

==Systematics and taxonomy==
The black kite was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; in 1770. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Falco migrans&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The type locality is France. The current genus &quot;Milvus&quot; was erected by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799. &quot;Milvus&quot; is the Latin word for a red kite; the specific &quot;migrans&quot; means &quot;migrating&quot; from the Latin &quot;migrare&quot; &quot;to migrate&quot;.

The red kite has been known to hybridize with the black kite (in captivity where both species were kept together, and in the wild on the Cape Verde Islands).

Recent DNA studies suggest that the yellow-billed African races &quot;parasitus&quot; and &quot;aegyptius&quot; differ significantly from black kites in the Eurasian clade, and should be considered a separate allopatric species: yellow-billed kite, &quot;M. aegyptius&quot;. They occur throughout Africa except for the Congo Basin and the Sahara Desert. There have been some suggestions that the black-eared kite (&quot;M. m. lineatus&quot;) should be elevated to full species status as &quot;M. lineatus&quot;, but this is not well supported.

===Subspecies===
Five subspecies are recognised.

* &quot;M. m. migrans&quot; – : European black kite
:Breeds Central, Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as the Maghreb region of Northwest Africa, to the Tien Shan and south to northwestern Pakistan. Winters in Sub-Saharan Africa. The head is whitish.
* &quot;M. m. lineatus&quot; – : black-eared kite
:Siberia to Amurland south around Himalaya to northern India, northern Indochina and southern China; Japan. Northern inland birds migrate to the eastern Persian Gulf coast and South Asia in winter. This has a larger pale .
* &quot;M. m. govinda&quot; – : small Indian kite (formerly pariah kite)
:Eastern Pakistan east through tropical India and Sri Lanka to Indochina and the Malay Peninsula. Resident. A dark brown kite found throughout the subcontinent. Can be seen circling and soaring in urban areas. Easily distinguished by the shallow forked tail. The name &quot;pariah&quot; originates from the Indian caste system and usage of this name is deprecated.
* &quot;M. m. affinis&quot; – : fork-tailed kite
:Sulawesi and possibly the Lesser Sunda Islands; Papua New Guinea except mountains; northeastern and eastern Australia.
* &quot;M. m. formosanus&quot; – : Taiwan kite
:Taiwan and Hainan; resident. Similar to &quot;lineatus&quot; but smaller, considered intermediate between &quot;lineatus&quot; and &quot;govinda&quot;. Recent genetic studies suggest that following the decline of local &quot;formosanus&quot; populations in Taiwan during the 20th century, the extant breeding populations in Taiwan now consist of intergrades between &quot;formosanus&quot; and &quot;lineatus&quot;. 


==Description==

Black kites can be distinguished from red kites by the slightly smaller size, less forked tail (visible in flight), and generally dark plumage without any rufous. The sexes are alike though the male is a little smaller and less aggressive (this is the case in most birds of prey). They weigh on average 735 grams. The upper plumage is brown but the head and neck tend to be paler. The patch behind the eye appears darker. The outer flight feathers are black and the feathers have dark cross bars and are mottled at the base. The lower parts of the body are pale brown, becoming lighter towards the chin. The body feathers have dark shafts giving it a streaked appearance. The cere and gape are yellow, but the bill is black (unlike that of the yellow-billed kite). The legs are yellow and the claws are black. They have a distinctive shrill whistle followed by a rapid whinnying call. Males and females have the same plumage but females are longer than males and have a little larger wingspan. Their wingspan is around 150 cm.

==Distribution==

The species is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. The temperate populations of this kite tend to be migratory while the tropical ones are resident. European and central Asian birds (subspecies &quot;M. m. migrans&quot; and black-eared kite &quot;M. m. lineatus&quot;, respectively) are migratory, moving to the tropics in winter, but races in warmer regions such as the Indian &quot;M. m. govinda&quot; (small Indian/pariah kite), or the Australasian &quot;M. m. affinis&quot; (fork-tailed kite), are resident. In some areas such as in the United Kingdom, the black kite occurs only as a wanderer on migration. These birds are usually of the nominate race, but in November 2006 a juvenile of the eastern &quot;lineatus&quot;, not previously recorded in western Europe, was found in Lincolnshire.

The species is not found in the Indonesian archipelago between the South East Asian mainland and the Wallace Line. Vagrants, most likely of the black-eared kite, on occasion range far into the Pacific, out to the Hawaiian Islands.

In India, the population of &quot;M. m. govinda&quot; is particularly large especially in areas of high human population. Here the birds avoid heavily forested regions. A survey in 1967 in the 150 square kilometres of the city of New Delhi produced an estimate of about 2200 pairs or roughly 15 per square kilometre. Another survey in 2013 estimated 150 pairs for every 10 square kilometres.

Vagrants from Australia occasionally reach New Zealand, however, only one individual has persisted there (currently ~21 years old).

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Food and foraging===

Black kites are most often seen gliding and soaring on thermals as they search for food. Their flight is buoyant and the bird glides effortlessly, changing directions easily. They will swoop down with their legs lowered to snatch small live prey, fish, household refuse and carrion, for which behaviour they are known in British military slang as the shite-hawk. They are opportunist hunters and have been known to take birds, bats, and rodents. They are attracted to smoke and fires, where they seek escaping prey. Kites are also known to spread wildfires in northern Australia by picking up and dropping burning twigs so as to flush prey, leading to them being known in some circles as &quot;firehawks&quot;. 

The Indian populations are well adapted to living in cities and are found in densely populated areas. Large numbers may be seen soaring in thermals over cities. In some places, they will readily swoop and snatch food held by humans. In Delhi, where black kites breed within the cities, religious offerings of meat to the kites are common among those who practice Islam. The meat is thrown into the air and the kites dive-bomb for the meat. Humans who are in the vicinity may suffer serious injury due to the sharp talons of the kites. The reinforcement between human proximity and being fed have decreased the kite&#x27;s fear of humans. Black kites in Spain prey on nestling waterfowl especially during summer to feed their young. Predation of nests of other pairs of black kites has also been noted. Kites have also been seen to tear and carry away the nests of baya weavers in an attempt to obtain eggs or chicks.

===Flocking and roosting===

In winter, kites form large communal roosts. Flocks may fly about before settling at the roost. When migrating, the black kite has a greater propensity to form large flocks than other migratory raptors, particularly prior to making a crossing over water. In India, the subspecies &quot;govinda&quot; shows large seasonal fluctuations with the highest numbers seen from July to October, after the monsoons, and it has been suggested that they make local movements in response to high rainfall.

===Breeding===

The breeding season of the black kite in India begins in winter (mainly January and February), the young birds fledging before the monsoons. The nest is a rough platform of twigs and sticks placed in a tree. Nest sites may be reused in subsequent years. European birds breed in summer. Birds in the Italian Alps tend to build their nest close to water in steep cliffs or tall trees. Nest orientation may be related to wind and rainfall. The nests may sometimes be decorated with bright materials such as white plastic and a study in Spain suggests that they may have a role in signalling to keep away other kites.

After pairing, the male frequently copulates with the female. Unguarded females may be approached by other males, and extra pair copulations are frequent. Males returning from a foraging trip will frequently copulate on return, as this increases the chances of his sperm fertilizing the eggs rather than a different male. Both the male and female take part in nest building, incubation and care of chicks.
The typical clutch size is 2 or sometimes 3 eggs. The incubation period varies from 30 to 34 days. Chicks of the Indian population stay at the nest for nearly two months. Chicks hatched later in European populations appear to fledge faster. The care of young by the parents also rapidly decreased with the need for adults to migrate. Siblings show aggression to each other and often the weaker chick may be killed, but parent birds were found to preferentially feed the smaller chicks in experimentally altered nests.

Newly hatched young have down (prepennae) which are sepia on the back and black around the eye and buff on the head, neck and underparts. This is replaced by brownish-gray second down (preplumulae). After 9–12 days, the second down appears on the whole body except the top of the head. Body feathers begin to appear after 18 to 22 days. The feathers on the head become noticeable from the 24th to 29th day. The nestlings initially feed on food fallen at the bottom of the nest and begin to tear flesh after 33–39 days. They are able to stand on their legs after 17–19 days and begin flapping their wings after 27–31 days. After 50 days, they begin to move to branches next to the nest. Birds are able to breed after their second year. Parent birds guard their nest and will dive aggressively at intruders. Humans who intrude the nest appear to be recognized by birds and singled out for dive attacks.

===Mortality factors===
Black-eared kites in Japan were found to accumulate nearly 70% of mercury accumulated from polluted food in the feathers, thus excreting it in the moult process. Black kites often perch on electric wires and are frequent victims of electrocution. Their habit of swooping to pick up dead rodents or other roadkill leads to collisions with vehicles. Instances of mass poisoning as a result of feeding on poisoned voles in agricultural fields have been noted. They are also a major nuisance at some airports, where their size makes them a significant birdstrike hazard.

As a large raptorial bird, the black kite has few natural predators. However, they do have a single serious predator: the Eurasian eagle-owl (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;). The eagle-owl freely picks off kites of any age and eagle-owls were noted to precipitously decrease kite breeding success when nesting within kilometres of the kites in the Italian Alps. Like most bird species, they have parasites; several species of endoparasitic trematodes are known and some Digenea species that are transmitted via fishes.

Birds with abnormal development of a secondary upper mandible have been recorded in &quot;govinda&quot; and &quot;lineatus&quot; subspecies.

<doc id="200977" wikidata="Q1530195" url="?curid=200977" title="Sexual objectification">
<text>Sexual objectification is the act of treating a person solely as an object of sexual desire (a sex object). Objectification more broadly means treating a person as a commodity or an object without regard to their personality or dignity. Objectification is most commonly examined at the level of a society (sociology), but can also refer to the behavior of individuals (psychology), and is a type of dehumanization.

Although both men and women can be sexually objectified, the concept is mainly associated with the objectification of women, and is an important idea in many feminist theories, and psychological theories derived from them. Many feminists argue that sexual objectification of girls and women contributes to gender inequality, and many psychologists associate objectification with a range of physical and mental health risks in women. Research suggests that the psychological effects of objectification of men are similar to those of women, leading to negative body image among men. The concept of sexual objectification is controversial, and some feminists and psychologists have argued that at least some degree of objectification is a normal part of human sexuality.
==Sexual objectification of women==
===General===
The sexual objectification of women involves them being viewed primarily as an object of heteronormative male sexual desire, rather than as a whole person. Although opinions differ as to which situations are objectionable, many see the objectification of women taking place in the sexually oriented depictions of women in advertising, art and media, pornography, the occupations of stripping and prostitution, and women being brazenly evaluated or judged sexually or aesthetically in public spaces and events, such as beauty contests.

Some feminists and psychologists argue that sexual objectification can lead to negative psychological effects including eating disorders, depression and sexual dysfunction, and can give women negative self-images because of the belief that their intelligence and competence are currently not being, nor will ever be, acknowledged by society. Sexual objectification of women has also been found to negatively affect women&#x27;s performance, confidence, and level of position in the workplace. How objectification has affected women and society in general is a topic of academic debate, with some saying girls&#x27; understanding of the importance of appearance in society may contribute to feelings of fear, shame, and disgust during the transition to womanhood, and others saying that young women are especially susceptible to objectification, as they are often taught that power, respect, and wealth can be derived from one&#x27;s outward appearance.

==Sexual objectification of men==
===General===
&quot;Male sexual objectification&quot; involves a man being in public in a sexual context.

Instances where men may be viewed as sexualized can be in advertisements, music videos, films, television shows, beefcake calendars, women&#x27;s magazines, male strip shows, and clothed female/nude male (CFNM) events. Women also purchase and consume pornography.

In her 1992 book, &quot;Sexual Reality: A Virtual Sex World Reader&quot;, feminist Susie Bright dedicated a chapter to a salon gathering she co-hosted with fellow feminists Laura Miller, Amy Wallace, and Lisa Palac at Wallace&#x27;s Berkeley Hills mansion, attended by 16 women writers and served by fully nude men they called &quot;slaveboys&quot;. The hosts had advertised for &quot;slaveboys&quot; in the &quot;San Francisco Weekly&quot;, stating, &quot;Genteel and Bohemian gathering of women writers requires comely slaveboys to serve at our tea party. You will serve nude and will not speak unless spoken to. [...]&quot;. The ad received about 100 responses, from which six were selected after &quot;nude auditions&quot;. The &quot;slaveboys&quot; served tea and meals, provided foot massages, polished nails, brushed hair, tended the fire, and posed for photographs with the guests. Bright also addresses criticism from unattended friends who called the setup &quot;reverse sexism&quot;, to which she responded unapologetically, adding a note of regret for not having sex with them.

Within gay male communities, men are often objectified. In 2007 a study found discussing negative effects of objectification was met with considerable resistance in the community. The sexual objectification of men of color may force them to play specific roles in sexual encounters that are not necessarily of their own choosing.

Research suggests that the psychological effects of objectification on men are similar to those of women, leading to negative body image among men.

=== Media ===
Men&#x27;s bodies have become more objectified than they previously were, though because of society&#x27;s established gaze on the objectification of women, the newfound objectification of men is not as widespread. Even with this increase of male objectification, men are still seen as the dominant figures and so the focus is still primarily on women.

Male sexual objectification has been found in 37% of advertisements featuring men&#x27;s body parts to showcase a product. Similar to the issues of sexual objectification in women, it is common for said objectification to lead men to body shaming, eating disorders, and a drive for perfection. The continued exposure of these &quot;ideal&quot; men subject society to expect all men to fit this role.

Male actors featured in TV shows and movies are oftentimes in excellent shape and have the &quot;ideal&quot; bodies. These men often fill the leading roles. When society is subjected to men who do not have ideal bodies, we typically see them as the comic relief. It is rare to see an out of shape man have a leading role. Leanne Dawson writes that &quot;There are temporal, cultural and geographical &quot;norms&quot; of gender and other aspects of identity, which are often incorrectly considered to be inherent or natural.&quot;

In the media, the ideal version of a man is seen as a strong, toned man. The idealized version of a woman is thin. Body evaluation is more commonly used to criticize women than men, and it can take different forms for men. For example, body evaluation is often directed at men&#x27;s nonverbal cues. By contrast, women more often are subject to body evaluation in the form of sexual, sometimes offensive, verbal remarks. Men tend to experience this from other men, whereas women experience it from both sexes. The Interpersonal Sexual Objectification Scale (ISOS) is a scale that shows sexual objectification of respondents, both men and women. While experiencing sexual objectification it creates the need to constantly maintain and critique one&#x27;s physical appearance. This leads to other things like eating disorders, body shaming, and anxiety. The ISOS scale can be related to objectification theory and sexism. Self-objectification, which is the way in which people evaluate themselves, is concentrated more on women. Men typically experience it through media display. To the extent that men do experience self-objectification, studies have shown that men typically do not experience its negative effects to the extent that women do.

In the media, sexual objectification has been used as a way to sell products to the general public. Sexual objectification has been used as a marketing strategy for many decades according to the Journal of Advertising. This specific strategy targets the public in selling products that will make them look and feel desirable and attractive. It is stated that this strategy sells well by grabbing the attention of the public. The journal states that explicit advertisements do better in marketing than other non-explicit ads.

==Views on sexual objectification==

While the concept of sexual objectification is important within feminist theory, ideas vary widely on what constitutes sexual objectification and what are the ethical implications of such objectification. Some feminists such as Naomi Wolf find the concept of physical attractiveness itself to be problematic, with some radical feminists being opposed to any evaluation of another person&#x27;s sexual attractiveness based on physical characteristics. John Stoltenberg goes so far as to condemn as wrongfully objectifying any sexual fantasy that involves the visualization of a woman.

Radical feminists view objectification as playing a central role in reducing women to what they refer to as the &quot;oppressed sex class&quot;. While some feminists view mass media in societies that they argue are patriarchal as objectifying, they often focus on pornography as playing an egregious role in habituating men to objectify women.

Cultural critics such as Robert Jensen and Sut Jhally accuse mass media and advertising of promoting the objectification of women to help promote goods and services, and the television and film industries are commonly accused of normalizing the sexual objectification of women.

The objection to the objectification of women is not a recent phenomenon. In the French Enlightenment, for example, there was a debate as to whether a woman&#x27;s breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift. In Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy&#x27;s 1771 play &quot;The True Mother&quot; (&quot;La Vraie Mère&quot;), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: &quot;Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts – the respectable treasures of nature – as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?&quot;

The issues concerning sexual objectification became first problemized during the 1970s by feminist groups. Since then, it has been argued that the phenomenon of female sexual objectification has increased drastically since its problematization in all levels of life, and has resulted in negative consequences for women, especially in the political sphere. However, a rising form of new third-waver feminist groups have also taken the increased objectification of women as an opportunity to use the female body as a mode of power.

Some social conservatives have taken up aspects of the feminist critique of sexual objectification. In their view, however, the increase in the sexual objectification of both sexes in Western culture is one of the negative legacies of the sexual revolution. These critics, notably Wendy Shalit, advocate a return to pre-sexual revolution standards of sexual morality, which Shalit refers to as a &quot;return to modesty&quot;, as an antidote to sexual objectification. Some social conservatives have argued that the feminist movement itself has contributed to the problem of the sexual objectification of women by promoting &quot;free&quot; love (i.e. men and women choosing to have non-reproductive sex outside of marriage and for their own pleasure).

Others such as civil libertarians and sex-positive feminists contest feminist claims about the objectification of women. Camille Paglia holds that &quot;[t]urning people into sex objects is one of the specialties of our species.&quot; In her view, objectification is closely tied to (and may even be identical with) the highest human faculties toward conceptualization and aesthetics. Feminist author Wendy Kaminer criticized feminist support for anti-pornography laws, arguing that pornography does not cause sexual violence, and bans on such material infantilize women. She has noted that radical feminists have often allied themselves with the Christian right in supporting these laws and denouncing the depiction of sex in popular culture although the two groups strongly disagree on virtually everything else. Her ACLU colleagues Nadine Strossen and Nan D. Hunter have made similar criticisms. Strossen has argued that objectification is not in and of itself dehumanizing, and may fulfill women&#x27;s own fantasies. Psychologist Nigel Barber argues that men, and to a lesser extent, women, are naturally inclined to focus on the physical attractiveness of the opposite sex (or the same sex in the case of gays and lesbians), and that this has been widely misinterpreted as sexism.

===Female self-objectification===
Ariel Levy contends that Western women who exploit their sexuality by, for example, wearing revealing clothing and engaging in lewd behavior, engage in female self-objectification, meaning they objectify themselves. While some women see such behaviour as a form of empowerment, Levy contends that it has led to greater emphasis on a physical criterion or sexualization for women&#x27;s perceived self-worth, which Levy calls &quot;raunch culture&quot;. In a study conducted by the State University of New York, it is found that women self-objectify when trying to fit the &quot;perfect&quot; female standard according to the male gaze.

Levy discusses this phenomenon in &quot;Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture&quot;. Levy followed the camera crew from the &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot; video series, and argues that contemporary America&#x27;s sexualized culture not only objectifies women, it encourages women to objectify themselves. In today&#x27;s culture, Levy writes, the idea of a woman participating in a wet T-shirt contest or being comfortable watching explicit pornography has become a symbol of feminist strength.

Jordan Peterson has asked why women need to wear make-up or high-heels in the workplace, that a double standard exists for sexual harassment and females who self-objectify themselves in society.

Social media has made a major impact on the self-objectification of women. Through social media, women self-objectify by posting provocative images they know will be objectified by their viewers as a form of seeking validation of posting images that fits the mold of society.

=== Latina women ===
Latina women face a particular form of sexual objectification based on stereotypes relating to Latina women. American media often portrays Latina women as being sexually promiscuous and curvaceous, having large breasts and buttocks, being melodramatic, or having a feisty attitude. Keller identifies three main stereotypes that contribute to the objectification of Latinas. (Cantina Girl, Suffering Senorita, and Vamp). The “Cantina Girl” is characterized as being an alluring sexual presence. The “Suffering Senorita” is the Latina who goes “bad” due to her love of the (usually Anglo) love interest. Lastly, the “Vamp” is seen as beautiful but devious, and a psychological threat for her wit or charm. All three of these categorizations stem from the sexual objectification of Latina women&#x27;s bodies and identities.

Such sexual objectifications hold real-world consequences for Latina women. For instance, the prevalence of negative Latina stereotypes (such as hypersexualization) has led to a decrease in positive in-group attitudes among the Latina community.

=== Black women ===
Black women have been fetishized and objectified throughout history. They may be portrayed as having a more animalistic nature than their non-black counterparts. People who fetishize black women are sometimes pejoratively said to have &quot;jungle fever&quot;.

Black women are widely objectified in the media and in pornography, and are scrutinized more closely for doing the same things as their non-black counterparts. They are also stereotyped in the media as having more curvaceous bodies and bigger lips.

==Objectification theory==

Objectification theory is a framework for understanding the experiences of women in cultures that sexually objectify them, proposed by Barbara Fredrickson and Tomi-Ann Roberts in 1997. Within this framework, Fredrickson and Roberts draw conclusions about women&#x27;s experiences. This theory states that, because of sexual objectification, women learn to internalize an outsider&#x27;s view of their bodies as the primary view of themselves. Women, they explain, begin to view their bodies as objects separate from their person. This internalization has been termed self-objectification. This theory does not seek to prove the existence of sexual objectification; the theory assumes its existence in culture. This self-objectification then, according to objectification theory, leads to increased habitual body monitoring. With this framework in mind, Fredrickson and Roberts suggest explanations for consequences they believe are the result of sexual objectification. The consequences suggested are: increased feelings of shame, increased feelings of anxiety, decreased peak motivational state, and decreased awareness of internal bodily states.

Sexual objectification has been studied based on the proposition that girls and women develop their primary view of their physical selves from observing others. These observations can take place in the media or through personal experience. Through a blend of expected and actual exposure, women are socialized to objectify their own physical characteristics from a third-person perception, which is identified as self-objectification. Women and girls develop an expected physical appearance for themselves, based on observations of others; and are aware that others are likely to observe as well. The sexual objectification and self-objectification of women is believed to influence social gender roles and inequalities between the sexes.

===Self-objectification===

Self-objectification can increase in situations which heighten the awareness of an individual&#x27;s physical appearance. Here, the presence of a third-person observer is enhanced. Therefore, when individuals know others are looking at them, or will be looking at them, they are more likely to care about their physical appearance. Examples of the enhanced presence of an observer include the presence of an audience, camera, or other known observer.

===Women, girls, and self-objectification===
Primarily, objectification theory describes how women and girls are influenced as a result of expected social and gender roles. Research indicates not all women are influenced equally, due to the anatomical, hormonal, and genetic differences of the female body; however, women&#x27;s bodies are often objectified and evaluated more frequently. Self-objectification in girls tends to stem from two main causes: the internalization of traditional beauty standards as translated through media as well as any instances of sexual objectification that they might encounter in their daily lives. It is not uncommon for women to translate their anxieties over their constant sense of objectification into obsessive self-surveillance. This, in turn, can lead to many serious problems in women and girls, including &quot;body shame, anxiety, negative attitudes toward menstruation, a disrupted flow of consciousness, diminished awareness of internal bodily states, depression, sexual dysfunction, and disordered eating.&quot;

Sexual objectification occurs when a person is identified by their sexual body parts or sexual function. In essence, an individual loses their identity, and is recognized solely by the physical characteristics of their body. The purpose of this recognition is to bring enjoyment to others, or to serve as a sexual object for society. Sexual objectification can occur as a social construct among individuals.

Sexual objectification has been around and present in society for many but has increased with the introduction of social media according to “Objectification, Sexualization, and Misrepresentation: Social Media and the College Experience - Stefanie E Davis, 2018” This journal shows a clear explanation for how young girls are influenced by social media to be sexually objectified. The platform is meant to share a glimpse into a person&#x27;s life through photos to share with friends, family and mutuals. For many individuals, social media applications like Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) are used to glamorize and romanticize certain lifestyles. Examples of this can be young women using their platform (however big it may be) to pose as an older age by uploading provocative photos. This behavior promotes sexual objectification of young girls that participate on social media.

===Psychological consequences===
Objectification theory suggests both direct and indirect consequences of objectification to women. Indirect consequences include self consciousness in terms that a woman is consistently checking or rearranging her clothes or appearance to ensure that she is presentable. More direct consequences are related to sexual victimization. Rape and sexual harassment are examples of this. Doob (2012) states that sexual harassment is one of the challenges faced by women in workplace. This may constitute sexual jokes or comments, most of which are degrading. Research indicates that objectification theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in the media are socialized and translated into mental health problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal level. These include increased self-consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental health threats (depression, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and sexual dysfunction), and increased body shame. Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including disordered eating, mental health, depression, motor performance, body image, idealized body type, stereotype formation, sexual perception and sexual typing. Body shame is a byproduct of the concept of an idealized body type adopted by most Western cultures that depicts a thin, model-type figure. Thus, women will engage in actions meant to change their body such as dieting, exercise, eating disorders, cosmetic surgery, etc. Effects of objectification theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels.

===Causes of depression===
Learned helplessness theory posits that because human bodies are only alterable to a certain point, people develop a sense of body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of helplessness in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness in being able to control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression. In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment because they have to depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another&#x27;s evaluation limits a woman&#x27;s ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression. Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes this results in a state of depression.

== Alternatives and critique ==
Ann J. Cahill uses the concept of &quot;derivitization&quot; as an alternative to objectification when trying to address sexual objectification&#x27;s seeming judgment of all physical interactions (termed somatophobia by Cahill). Cahill criticizes the notion of objectification as marginalizing the role of the body in one&#x27;s subjective experience and therefore making it impossible to understand how being viewed as a sexually appealing body can enhance an individual&#x27;s notion of self. 

Instead, Cahill uses the concept of subjectivity from the study of intersubjectivity. A subject is an individual with their unique experience of reality. Derivitization is then defined as limiting another person&#x27;s subjective behaviour and experience to align with or serve your own subjective experience. In this framing, the objectification exists in sex work is viewed instead as the derivitization of having another act for only one&#x27;s own subjective experience and ignoring the sex worker&#x27;s experience. Drawing comparisons to the doctor–patient relationship, Cahill argues that a recognition of what both people bring to a relationship and their subjective goals is what makes a relationship ethical.

=== Free use ===
&quot;Free use&quot; describes a sexual fetish involving being consensually &quot;used&quot; as a sex object at any time and anywhere by a sexual partner when they are aroused, including while doing chores or while sleeping. It became popular online in the mid-2020s, including in gay pornography, on Reddit—where one subreddit dedicated to the fetish had over 1.4 million members by 2023—and on TikTok.

<text>The Greek War of Independence, also known as the Greek Revolution or the Greek Revolution of 1821, was a successful war of independence by Greek revolutionaries against the Ottoman Empire between 1821 and 1829. In 1826, the Greeks were assisted by the British Empire, Kingdom of France, and the Russian Empire, while the Ottomans were aided by their vassals, especially by the Eyalet of Egypt. The war led to the formation of modern Greece, which would be expanded to its modern size in later years. The revolution is celebrated by Greeks around the world as independence day on 25 March.

All Greek territory, except the Ionian Islands, the Mani Peninsula, and mountainous regions in Epirus, came under Ottoman rule in the 15th century. During the following centuries, there were Greek uprisings against Ottoman rule. Most uprisings began in the independent Greek realm of the Mani Peninsula, which was never conquered by the Ottomans. In 1814, a secret organization called the Filiki Eteria (Society of Friends) was founded with the aim of liberating Greece. It planned to launch revolts in the Peloponnese, the Danubian Principalities, and Constantinople. The insurrection was planned for 25 March 1821, the Orthodox Christian Feast of the Annunciation. However, the plans were discovered by the Ottoman authorities, forcing it to start earlier.

The first revolt began on 21 February 1821 in the Danubian Principalities, but it was soon put down by the Ottomans. These events urged Greeks in the Peloponnese into action and on 17 March 1821, the Maniots were first to declare war. In September 1821, the Greeks, under the leadership of Theodoros Kolokotronis, captured Tripolitsa. Revolts in Crete, Macedonia, and Central Greece broke out, but were suppressed. Greek fleets achieved success against the Ottoman navy in the Aegean Sea and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea. Tensions developed among Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars. The Ottoman Sultan called in Muhammad Ali of Egypt, who agreed to send his son, Ibrahim Pasha, to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gains. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and brought most of the peninsula under Egyptian control by the end of that year. Despite a failed invasion of Mani, Athens also fell and revolutionary morale decreased.

The three great powers—Russia, Britain, and France—decided to intervene, sending their naval squadrons to Greece in 1827. They destroyed the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet at the Battle of Navarino, and turned the tide in favor of the revolutionaries. In 1828, the Egyptian army withdrew under pressure from a French expeditionary force. The Ottoman garrisons in the Peloponnese surrendered and the Greek revolutionaries retook central Greece. The Ottoman Empire declared war on Russia allowing for the Russian army to move into the Balkans. This forced the Ottomans to accept Greek autonomy in the Treaty of Adrianople and semi-autonomy for Serbia and the Romanian principalities. After nine years of war, Greece was recognized as an independent state under the London Protocol of February 1830. Further negotiations in 1832 led to the London Conference and the Treaty of Constantinople, which defined the final borders of the new state and established Prince Otto of Bavaria as the first king of Greece.

==Background==
===Ottoman rule over Greece===

The Fall of Constantinople on 29 May 1453 and the subsequent fall of the successor states of the Byzantine Empire marked the end of Byzantine sovereignty. After that, the Ottoman Empire ruled the Balkans and Anatolia (Asia Minor), with some exceptions. Orthodox Christians were granted some political rights under Ottoman rule, but they were considered inferior subjects. The majority of Greeks were called Rayah by the Turks, a name that referred to the large mass of non-Muslim subjects under the Ottoman ruling class.

Meanwhile, Greek intellectuals and humanists, who had migrated west before or during the Ottoman invasions, such as Demetrios Chalkokondyles and Leonardos Philaras, began to call for the liberation of their homeland. Demetrius Chalcondyles called on Venice and &quot;all of the Latins&quot; to aid the Greeks against &quot;the abominable, monstrous, and impious barbarian Turks&quot;. However, Greece was to remain under Ottoman rule for several more centuries.

The Greek Revolution was not an isolated event; numerous failed attempts at regaining independence took place throughout the Ottoman era. Throughout the 17th century, there was great resistance to the Ottomans in the Morea and elsewhere, as evidenced by revolts led by Dionysius the Philosopher. After the Morean War, the Peloponnese came under Venetian rule for 30 years, and remained in turmoil from then on and throughout the 17th century, as bands of klephts multiplied.

The first great uprising was the Russian-sponsored Orlov Revolt of the 1770s, which was crushed by the Ottomans after having limited success. After the suppression of the uprising, Muslim Albanians ravaged many regions of mainland Greece. However, the Maniots continually resisted Ottoman rule and defeated several Ottoman incursions into their region, the most famous of which was the invasion of 1770. During the Second Russo-Turkish War, the Greek community of Trieste financed a small fleet under Lambros Katsonis, which was a nuisance for the Ottoman navy; during the war klephts and &quot;armatoloi&quot; (guerilla fighters in mountainous areas) rose once again.

At the same time, a number of Greeks enjoyed a privileged position in the Ottoman state as members of the Ottoman bureaucracy. Greeks controlled the affairs of the Orthodox Church through the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, as the higher clergy of the Orthodox Church was mostly of Greek origin. Thus, as a result of the Ottoman millet system, the predominantly Greek hierarchy of the Patriarchate enjoyed control over the Empire&#x27;s Orthodox subjects (the &quot;Rum milleti&quot;).

The Greek Orthodox Church played a pivotal role in the preservation of national identity, the development of Greek society and the resurgence of Greek nationalism. From the early 18th century and onwards, members of prominent Greek families in Constantinople, known as Phanariotes (after the Phanar district of the city), gained considerable control over Ottoman foreign policy and eventually over the bureaucracy as a whole.

====Klephts and armatoloi====
In times of militarily weak central authority, the Balkan countryside became infested by groups of bandits called &quot;klephts&quot; () (the Greek equivalent of the hajduks) that struck at Muslims and Christians alike. Defying Ottoman rule, the klephts were highly admired and held a significant place in popular lore.

Responding to the klephts&#x27; attacks, the Ottomans recruited the ablest amongst these groups, contracting Christian militias, known as &quot;armatoloi&quot; (), to secure endangered areas, especially mountain passes. The area under their control was called an &quot;armatolik&quot;, the oldest known being established in Agrafa during the reign of Murad II (r. 1421–1451). The distinction between klephts and &quot;armatoloi&quot; was not clear, as the latter would often turn into klephts to extort more benefits from the authorities, while, conversely, another klepht group would be appointed to the &quot;armatolik&quot; to confront their predecessors.

Nevertheless, klephts and &quot;armatoloi&quot; formed a provincial elite, though not a social class, whose members would muster under a common goal. As the &quot;armatoloi&quot;&#x27;s position gradually turned into a hereditary one, some captains took care of their &quot;armatolik&quot; as their personal property. A great deal of power was placed in their hands and they integrated in the network of clientelist relationships that formed the Ottoman administration. Some managed to establish exclusive control in their &quot;armatolik&quot;, forcing the Porte to try repeatedly, though unsuccessfully, to eliminate them.

By the time of the War of Independence, powerful &quot;armatoloi&quot; could be traced in Rumeli, Thessaly, Epirus and southern Macedonia. To the revolutionary leader and writer Yannis Makriyannis, klephts and &quot;armatoloi&quot;—being the only available major military force on the side of the Greeks—played such a crucial role in the Greek revolution that he referred to them as the &quot;yeast of liberty&quot;. Contrary to conventional Greek history, many of the klephts and armatoles participated at the Greek War of Independence according to their own militaristic patron-client terms. They saw the war as an economic and political opportunity to expand their areas of operation. Balkan bandits such as the klephts and armatoles glorified in nationalist historiography as national heroes—were actually driven by economic interests, were not aware of national projects, made alliances with the Ottomans and robbed Christians as much as Muslims. Nevertheless, they seldom robbed common folk, from whose ranks they came, and more often raided Turks, with whom they were separated by religion, nationality, and social class. They enjoyed the support of the generally oppressed common folk, as they were in opposition to established authority. A vast oral tradition of folk poetry attests to the sympathy they evoked and their reputation for patriotism. Some famous armatoles leaders were Odysseas Androutsos, Georgios Karaiskakis, Athanasios Diakos, Markos Botsaris and Giannis Stathas.

===Enlightenment and the Greek national movement===

Due to economic developments within and outside the Ottoman Empire in the 18th century, Greek merchants and sailors became affluent and generated the wealth necessary to found schools and libraries, and to pay for young Greeks to study at the universities of Western Europe. There they came into contact with the radical ideas of the European Enlightenment, the French Revolution and romantic nationalism. Educated and influential members of the large Greek diaspora, such as Adamantios Korais and Anthimos Gazis, tried to transmit these ideas back to the Greeks, with the double aim of raising their educational level and simultaneously strengthening their national identity. This was achieved through the dissemination of books, pamphlets and other writings in Greek, in a process that has been described as the modern Greek Enlightenment ().
Crucial for the development of the Greek national idea were the Russo-Turkish Wars of the 18th century. Peter the Great had envisaged a disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and the re-institution of a new Byzantine Empire with an Orthodox emperor. His Pruth River Campaign of 1711 set a precedent for the Greeks, when Peter appealed to Orthodox Christians to join the Russians and rise against the Turks to fight for &quot;faith and homeland&quot;. The Russo-Turkish wars of Catherine II (1762–1796) made the Greeks consider their emancipation with the aid of Russia. An independence movement in Peloponnesus (Morea) was incited by Russian agents in 1769, and a Greek flotilla under Lambros Katsonis assisted the Russian fleet in the war of 1788–1792. The Greek revolts of the 18th century were unsuccessful but far larger than the revolts of previous centuries, and they laid the foundation for a national revolution.

Revolutionary nationalism grew across Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries (including in the Balkans), due to the influence of the French Revolution. As the power of the Ottoman Empire declined, Greek nationalism began to assert itself. The most influential of the Greek writers and intellectuals was Rigas Feraios. Deeply influenced by the French Revolution, Rigas was the first to conceive and organize a comprehensive national movement aiming at the liberation of all Balkan nations—including the Turks of the region—and the creation of a &quot;Balkan Republic&quot;. Arrested by Austrian officials in Trieste in 1797, he was handed over to Ottoman officials and transported to Belgrade along with his co-conspirators. All of them were strangled to death in June 1798 and their bodies were dumped in the Danube. The death of Rigas fanned the flames of Greek nationalism; his nationalist poem, the &quot;Thourios&quot; (war-song), was translated into a number of Western European and later Balkan languages and served as a rallying cry for Greeks against Ottoman rule.

Another influential Greek writer and intellectual was Adamantios Korais who witnessed the French Revolution. Korais&#x27; primary intellectual inspiration was from the Enlightenment, and he borrowed ideas from Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. When Korais was a young adult he moved to Paris to continue his studies. He eventually graduated from the Montpellier School of Medicine and spent the remainder of his life in Paris. He would often have political and philosophical debates with Thomas Jefferson. While in Paris he was a witness to the French Revolution and saw the democracy that came out of it. He spent a lot of his time convincing wealthy Greeks to build schools and libraries to further the education of Greeks. He believed that a furthering in education would be necessary for the general welfare and prosperity of the people of Greece, as well as the country. Korais&#x27; ultimate goal was a democratic Greece much like the Golden Age of Pericles.

The Greek cause began to draw support not only from the large Greek merchant diaspora in both Western Europe and Russia, but also from Western European Philhellenes. This Greek movement for independence was not only the first movement of national character in Eastern Europe, but also the first one in a non-Christian environment, like the Ottoman Empire.

===Filiki Eteria===

Feraios&#x27; martyrdom was to inspire three young Greek merchants: Nikolaos Skoufas, Emmanuil Xanthos, and Athanasios Tsakalov. Influenced by the Italian Carbonari and profiting from their own experience as members of Freemasonic organizations, they founded in 1814 the secret Filiki Eteria (&quot;Friendly Society&quot;) in Odessa, an important center of the Greek mercantile diaspora in Russia. With the support of wealthy Greek exile communities in Britain and the United States and with the aid of sympathizers in Western Europe, they planned the rebellion.

The society&#x27;s basic objective was a revival of the Byzantine Empire, with Constantinople as the capital, not the formation of a national state. In early 1820, Ioannis Kapodistrias, an official from the Ionian Islands who had become the joint foreign minister of Tsar Alexander I, was approached by the Society in order to be named leader but declined the offer; the &quot;Filikoi&quot; (members of Filiki Eteria) then turned to Alexander Ypsilantis, a Phanariote serving in the Russian army as general and adjutant to Alexander, who accepted.

The Filiki Eteria expanded rapidly and was soon able to recruit members in all areas of the Greek world and among all elements of the Greek society. In 1821, the Ottoman Empire mainly faced war against Persia and more particularly the revolt by Ali Pasha in Epirus, which had forced the &quot;vali&quot; (governor) of the Morea, Hursid Pasha, and other local pashas to leave their provinces and campaign against the rebel force. At the same time, the Great Powers, allied in the &quot;Concert of Europe&quot; in opposition to revolutions in the aftermath of Napoleon I of France, were preoccupied with revolts in Italy and Spain. It was in this context that the Greeks judged the time ripe for their own revolt. The plan originally involved uprisings in three places, the Peloponnese, the Danubian Principalities and Constantinople.

==Philhellenism==
Because of the Greek origin of so much of the West&#x27;s classical heritage, there was tremendous sympathy for the Greek cause throughout Europe. Some wealthy Americans and Western European aristocrats, such as the renowned poet Lord Byron and later the American physician Samuel Howe, took up arms to join the Greek revolutionaries. In Britain there was strong support led by the Philosophical Radicals, the Whigs, and the Evangelicals. Many helped to finance the revolution. The London Philhellenic Committee helped insurgent Greece to float two loans in 1824 (£800,000) and 1825 (£2,000,000). The Scottish philhellene Thomas Gordon took part in the revolutionary struggle and later documented some of the first histories of the Greek Revolution in English.

In Europe, the Greek revolt aroused widespread sympathy among the public, although at first it was met with lukewarm and negative reception from the Great Powers. Some historians argue that Ottoman atrocities were given wide coverage in Europe, while Greek atrocities tended to be suppressed or played down. The Ottoman massacres at Chios in 1822 inspired Eugène Delacroix&#x27;s famous painting &quot;Massacre of Chios&quot;; other philhellenic works by Delacroix were inspired by Byron&#x27;s poems. Byron, the most celebrated philhellene of all, lent his name, prestige and wealth to the cause.

Byron organized funds and supplies (including the provision of several ships), but died from fever at Missolonghi in 1824. Byron&#x27;s death strengthened European sympathy for the Greek cause. His poetry, along with Delacroix&#x27;s art, helped arouse European public opinion in favor of the Greek revolutionaries to the point of no return, and led Western powers to intervene directly.

Philhellenism made a notable contribution to romanticism, enabling the younger generation of artistic and literary intellectuals to expand the classical repertoire by treating modern Greek history as an extension of ancient history; the idea of a regeneration of the spirit of ancient Greece permeated the rhetoric of the Greek cause&#x27;s supporters. Classicists and romantics of that period envisioned the casting out of the Turks as the prelude to the revival of the Golden Age.

==History==
===Outbreak of the revolution===
====Danubian principalities====

Alexander Ypsilantis was elected as the head of the Filiki Eteria in April 1820 and took upon himself the task of planning the insurrection. His intention was to raise all the Christians of the Balkans in rebellion and perhaps force Russia to intervene on their behalf. On 22 February , he crossed the river Prut with his followers, entering the Danubian Principalities. In order to encourage the local Romanian Christians to join him, he announced that he had &quot;the support of a Great Power&quot;, implying Russia. Two days after crossing the Prut, at Three Holy Hierarchs Monastery in Iași (Jassy), the capital of Moldavia, Ypsilantis issued a proclamation calling all Greeks and Christians to rise up against the Ottomans:
Michael Soutzos, then Prince of Moldavia and a member of Filiki Etaireia, set his guard at Ypsilantis&#x27; disposal. In the meanwhile, Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople and the Synod had anathematized and excommunicated both Ypsilantis and Soutzos issuing many encyclicals, an explicit denunciation of the Revolution in line with the Orthodox Church&#x27;s policy.

Instead of directly advancing on Brăila, where he arguably could have prevented Ottoman armies from entering the Principalities, and where he might have forced Russia to accept a fait accompli, Ypsilantis remained in Iaşi and ordered the executions of several pro-Ottoman Moldavians. In Bucharest, where he arrived in early April after some weeks delay, he decided that he could not rely on the Wallachian Pandurs to continue their Oltenian-based revolt and assist the Greek cause. The Pandur leader was Tudor Vladimirescu, who had already reached the outskirts of Bucharest on 16 March . In Bucharest, the relations of the two men deteriorated dramatically; Vladimirescu&#x27;s first priority was to assert his authority against the newly appointed prince Scarlat Callimachi, trying to maintain relations with both Russia and the Ottomans.

At that point, Kapodistrias, the foreign minister of Russia, was ordered by Alexander I to send Ypsilantis a letter upbraiding him for misusing the mandate received from the Tsar; Kapodistrias announced to Ypsilantis that his name had been struck off the army list and that he was commanded to lay down arms. Ypsilantis tried to ignore the letter, but Vladimirescu took this as the end of his alliance with the Eteria. A conflict erupted inside the camp and Vladimirescu was tried and put to death by the Eteria on 26 May . The loss of their Romanian allies, followed by an Ottoman intervention on Wallachian soil, sealed defeat for the Greek exiles and culminated in the disastrous Battle of Dragashani and the destruction of the Sacred Band on 7 June .
Alexander Ypsilantis, accompanied by his brother Nicholas and a remnant of his followers, retreated to Râmnicu Vâlcea, where he spent some days negotiating with the Austrian authorities for permission to cross the frontier. Fearing that his followers might surrender him to the Turks, he gave out that Austria had declared war on Turkey, caused a Te Deum to be sung in Cozia Monastery, and on pretext of arranging measures with the Austrian commander-in-chief, he crossed the frontier. However, the reactionary policies of the Holy Alliance were enforced by Francis II and the country refused to give asylum for leaders of revolts in neighboring countries. Ypsilantis was kept in close confinement for seven years. In Moldavia, the struggle continued for a while, under Giorgakis Olympios and Yiannis Pharmakis, but by the end of the year the provinces had been pacified by the Ottomans.

The outbreak of the war was met by mass executions, pogrom-style attacks, the destruction of churches, and looting of Greek properties throughout the Empire. The most severe atrocities occurred in Constantinople, in what became known as the Constantinople Massacre of 1821. The Orthodox Patriarch Gregory V was executed on 22 April 1821 on the orders of the Sultan despite his opposition to the revolt, which caused outrage throughout Europe and resulted in increased support for the Greek rebels.

====Peloponnese====

The Peloponnese, with its long tradition of resistance to the Ottomans, was to become the heartland of the revolt. In the early months of 1821, with the absence of the Ottoman governor of the Morea (&quot;Mora valesi&quot;) Hursid Pasha and many of his troops, the situation was favourable for the Greeks to rise against Ottoman occupation. The crucial meeting was held at Vostitsa (modern Aigion), where chieftains and prelates from all over the Peloponnese assembled on 26 January. There, Papaflessas, a pro-revolution priest who presented himself as representative of Filiki Eteria, clashed with most of the civil leaders and members of the senior clergy, such as Metropolitan Germanos of Patras, who were sceptical and demanded guarantees about a Russian intervention.
As news came of Ypsilantis&#x27; march into the Danubian Principalities, the atmosphere in the Peloponnese was tense, and by mid-March, sporadic incidents against Muslims occurred, heralding the start of the uprising. According to oral tradition, the Revolution was declared on 25 March 1821 (N.S. 6 April) by Metropolitan Germanos of Patras, who raised the banner with the cross in the Monastery of Agia Lavra (near Kalavryta, Achaea) although some historians question the historicity of the event. Some claim that the story first appears in 1824 in a book written by a French diplomat François Pouqueville, whose book is full of inventions. Historian David Brewer noted that Pouqueville was an Anglophobe, and in his account of the speech by Germanos in his book, Pouqueville has the Metropolitan express Anglophobic sentiments similar to those commonly expressed in France, and has him praise France as Greece&#x27;s one true friend in the world, which led Brewer to conclude that Pouqueville had made the entire story up. However, a study on the archive of Hugues Pouqueville (François Pouqueville&#x27;s brother) claims that François&#x27; account was accurate, without making any reference to the purported Anglophobia or Francophilia of Germanos. Also, some European newspapers of June and July 1821 published the news of declaration of revolution by Germanos either in Patras on 6 April/25 March 1821 or in the &quot;Monastery of Velia Mountain&quot; (Agia Lavra) on a non-specified date.

On 17 March 1821, war was declared on the Turks by the Maniots in Areopoli. The same day, a force of 2,000 Maniots under the command of Petros Mavromichalis advanced on the Messenian town of Kalamata, where they united with troops under Theodoros Kolokotronis, Nikitaras and Papaflessas; Kalamata fell to the Greeks on 23 March. In Achaia, the town of Kalavryta was besieged on 21 March, and in Patras conflicts lasted for many days. The Ottomans launched sporadic attacks towards the city while the revolutionaries, led by Panagiotis Karatzas, drove them back to the fortress.

By the end of March, the Greeks effectively controlled the countryside, while the Turks were confined to the fortresses, most notably those of Patras (recaptured by the Turks on 3 April by Yussuf Pasha), Rio, Acrocorinth, Monemvasia, Nafplion and the provincial capital, Tripolitsa, where many Muslims had fled with their families at the beginning of the uprising. All these were loosely besieged by local irregular forces under their own captains, since the Greeks lacked artillery. With the exception of Tripolitsa, all cities had access to the sea and could be resupplied and reinforced by the Ottoman fleet. Since May, Kolokotronis organized the siege of Tripolitsa, and, in the meantime, Greek forces twice defeated the Turks, who unsuccessfully tried to repulse the besiegers. Finally, Tripolitsa was seized by the Greeks on 23 September , and the city was given over to the mob for two days. After lengthy negotiations, the Turkish forces surrendered Acrocorinth on 14 January 1822.

====Central Greece====
The first regions to revolt in Central Greece were Phocis (24 March) and Salona (27 March). In Boeotia, Livadeia was captured by Athanasios Diakos on 31 March, followed by Thebes two days later. When the revolution began, most of the Christian population of Athens fled to Salamis. Missolonghi revolted on 25 May, and the revolution soon spread to other cities of western Central Greece. The Ottoman commander in the Roumeli was the Albanian general Omer Vrioni who become infamous for his &quot;Greek hunts&quot; in Attica, which was described thus: &quot;One of his favourite amusements was a &#x27;Greek hunt&#x27; as the Turks called it. They would go out in parties of fifty to a hundred, mounted on fleet horses, and scour the open country in search of Greek peasantry, who might from necessity or hardihood have ventured down upon the plains. After capturing some, they would give the poor creatures a certain distance to start ahead, hoping to escape, and then try the speed of their horses in overtaking them, the accuracy of their pistols in firing at them as they ran, or the keenness of their sabres&#x27; edge in cutting off their heads&quot;. Those not cut down or shot down during the &quot;Greek hunts&quot; were impaled afterwards when captured.

The initial Greek successes were soon put in peril after two subsequent defeats at the battles of Alamana and Eleftherohori against the army of Omer Vrioni. Another significant loss for the Greeks was the death of Diakos, a promising military leader, who was captured in Alamana and executed by the Turks when he refused to declare allegiance to the Sultan. The Greeks managed to halt the Turkish advance at the Battle of Gravia under the leadership of Odysseas Androutsos, who, with a handful of men, inflicted heavy casualties upon the Turkish army. After his defeat and the successful retreat of Androutsos&#x27; force, Omer Vrioni postponed his advance towards Peloponnese awaiting reinforcements; instead, he invaded Livadeia, which he captured on 10 June, and Athens, where he lifted the siege of the Acropolis. After a Greek force of 2,000 men managed to destroy at Vassilika a Turkish relief army on its way to Vrioni, the latter abandoned Attica in September and retreated to Ioannina. By the end of 1821, the revolutionaries had managed to temporarily secure their positions in Central Greece.

====The Ottoman reaction====
The news that the Greeks had revolted sparked murderous fury all over the Ottoman Empire. In Constantinople, on Easter Sunday, the Patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Church, Gregory V, was publicly hanged although he had condemned the revolution and preached obedience to the Sultan in his sermons. Since the revolution began in March, the Sublime Porte had executed at random various prominent Greeks living in Constantinople, such as the serving Dragoman of the Porte and two retired dragomans, a number of wealthy bankers and merchants, including a member of the ultra-rich Mavrocordatos family, three monks and a priest of the Orthodox church, and three ordinary Greeks accused of planning to poison the city&#x27;s water supply. In the city of Smyrna (modern İzmir, Turkey), which until 1922 was a mostly Greek city, Ottoman soldiers drawn from the interior of Anatolia on their way to fight in either Greece or Moldavia/Wallachia, staged a pogrom in June 1821 against the Greeks, leading Gordon to write: &quot;3,000 ruffians assailed the Greek quarter, plundered the houses and slaughtered the people; Smyrna resembled a place taken by assault, neither age or sex being respected&quot;. When a local mullah was asked to give a &quot;fatwa&quot; justifying the murder of Christians by Muslims and refused, he too was promptly killed.

====International reaction====
The news of the revolution was greeted with dismay by the conservative leaders of Europe, committed to upholding the system established at the Congress of Vienna, but was greeted with enthusiasm by many ordinary people across Europe. After the execution of the Patriarch Gregory V, the Russian Emperor Alexander I broke off diplomatic relations with the Sublime Porte after his foreign minister Count Ioannis Kapodistrias sent an ultimatum demanding promises from the Ottomans to stop executing Orthodox priests, which the Porte did not see fit to answer. In the summer of 1821, various young men from all over Europe began to gather in the French port of Marseille to book a passage to Greece and join the revolution. The French philhellene Jean-François-Maxime Raybaud wrote when he heard of the revolution in March 1821, &quot;I learnt with a thrill that Greece was shaking off her chains&quot; and in July 1821 boarded a ship going to Greece. Between the summer of 1821 and end of 1822, when the French started to inspect ships leaving Marseille for philhellenes, some 360 volunteers travelled to Greece. From the United States came the doctor Samuel Gridley Howe and the soldier George Jarvis to fight with the Greeks. The largest contingents came from the German states, France and the Italian states.

In Nafplio, a monument to honor the philhellenes who died fighting in the war listed 274 names, of which 100 are from Germany, forty each from France and Italy, and the rest from Britain, Spain, Hungary, Sweden, Portugal and Denmark.
In Germany, Italy and France many clergymen and university professors gave speeches saying all of Europe owed a huge debt to ancient Greece, that the modern Greeks were entitled to call upon the classical heritage as a reason for support, and that Greece would only achieve progress with freedom from the Ottoman Empire. A young medical student in Mannheim wrote that hearing his professor lecture on the need for Greek freedom went through him like an electric shock, inspiring him to drop his studies and head to Greece, while a Danish student wrote: &quot;How could a man inclined to fight for freedom and justice find a better place than next to the oppressed Greeks?&quot;. In France, Britain, Spain, Russia, the United States, and many other places &quot;Greek committees&quot; were established to raise funds and supplies for the revolution.

Citizens of the United States, from elite as well as modest socioeconomic backgrounds, supported the Greek cause, donating money and supplies to numerous philhellenic groups in both the northern and southern United States. The classicist Edward Everett, a professor of Ancient Greek literature at Harvard University, was active in championing the Greek cause in the United States and in November 1821 published an appeal from Adamantios Korais reading &quot;To the Citizens of the United States, it is your land that Liberty has fixed her abode, so you will not assuredly imitate the culpable indifference or rather the long ingratitude of the Europeans&quot;, going on to call for American intervention, in several American newspapers. In 1821, the Greek committee in Charleston, South Carolina sent the Greeks 50 barrels of salted meat while the Greek Committee in Springfield, Massachusetts sent supplies of salted meat, sugar, fish and flour. Newspapers in the United States gave the war much coverage and were overwhelmingly pro-Greek in their stance, which explains why American public opinion was so supportive. In New York City, one ball put on by the Greek committee raised $8,000 (~$180,000 in 2021). In Russia, the St. Petersburg Greek committee under Prince Alexander Golitsyn had raised 973,500 roubles by August 1822. By the end of the war, millions of roubles had been raised in Russia for the relief of refugees and to buy enslaved Greeks freedom (though the government forbade buying arms for the Greeks), but no Russian is known to have gone to fight with the Greeks.

The first independent state to recognise Greek independence was Haiti. Jean-Pierre Boyer, President of Haiti, wrote a letter on 15 January 1822 to four Greek expatriates living in France who had assembled themselves into a committee to seek international support for the Greek revolution. Boyer expressed sympathy for the Greek cause, though said that he was unable to provide financial or military support.

====First administrative and political institutions====

After the fall of Kalamata, the Messenian Senate, the first of the Greeks&#x27; local governing councils, held its inaugural session. At almost the same time, the Achean Directorate was summoned in Patras, but its members were soon forced to flee to Kalavryta. With the initiative of the Messenian Senate, a Peloponnesian assembly convened, and elected a Senate on 26 May. Most of the members of the Peloponnesian Senate were local notables (lay and ecclesiastical) or persons controlled by them.

The three major social groups that provided the leadership of the revolution were the primates (wealthy landowners who controlled about a third of the arable land in the Peloponnese), the captains drawn from the &quot;klephts&quot; and/or &quot;armatolos&quot; (&quot;klepts&quot; and &quot;armatolos&quot; tended to alternate), and the wealthy merchants, who were the most Westernised elements in Greek society. One of the more prominent leaders of the merchants and a &quot;Westerniser&quot; was the Phanariot Alexandros Mavrokordatos who was living with the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and his wife Mary Shelley in Pisa when the revolution began, and upon hearing of the revolution, purchased supplies and a ship in Marseille and then set sail for Greece. Mavrokordhatos&#x27;s wealth, education (he was fluent in seven languages) and his experience as an Ottoman official ruling Wallachia led many to look towards him as a leader.

When Demetrios Ypsilantis arrived in Peloponnese as official representative of Filiki Eteria, he tried to assume control of the Revolution&#x27;s affairs, and he thus proposed a new system of electing the members of the Senate, which was supported by the military leaders, but opposed by the notables. Assemblies convened also in Central Greece (November 1821) under the leadership of two Phanariots: Alexandros Mavrokordatos in the western part, and Theodoros Negris in the eastern part. These assemblies adopted two local statutes, the Charter of Western Continental Greece and the Legal Order of Eastern Continental Greece, drafted mainly by Mavrokordatos and Negris respectively. The statutes provided for the creation of two local administrative organs in Central Greece, an Areopagus in the east, and a Senate in the west. The three local statutes were recognized by the First National Assembly, but the respective administrative institutions were turned into administrative branches of the central government. They were later dissolved by the Second National Assembly.

====Revolutionary activity in Crete, Macedonia and Cyprus====

=====Crete=====
Cretan participation in the revolution was extensive, but it failed to achieve liberation from Turkish rule because of Egyptian intervention. Crete had a long history of resisting Turkish rule, exemplified by the folk hero Daskalogiannis, who was killed while fighting the Turks. In 1821, an uprising by Christians was met with a fierce response from the Ottoman authorities and the execution of several bishops, regarded as ringleaders.

Despite the Turkish reaction the rebellion persisted, and thus Sultan Mahmud II (r. 1808–1839) was forced to seek the aid of Muhammad Ali of Egypt, trying to lure him with the &quot;pashalik&quot; of Crete. On 28 May 1822, an Egyptian fleet of 30 warships and 84 transports arrived at Souda Bay led by Hasan Pasha, Muhammad Ali&#x27;s son-in-law; he was tasked with ending the rebellion and did not waste any time in the burning of villages throughout Crete.

After Hasan&#x27;s accidental death in February 1823, another son-in-law of Muhammad Ali of Egypt, Hussein Bey, led a well-organised and well-armed joint Turkish-Egyptian force of 12,000 soldiers with the support of artillery and cavalry. On 22 June 1823, Emmanouil Tombazis, appointed Commissioner of Crete by the Greek revolutionary government, held the Convention of Arcoudaina in an attempt to reconcile the factions of local captains and unite them against the common threat. He then gathered 3,000 men in Gergeri to face Hussein, but the Cretans were defeated by the much larger and better-organised force, and lost 300 men at the battle of Amourgelles on 20 August 1823. By the spring of 1824, Hussein had managed to limit the Cretan resistance to just a few mountain enclaves.
Towards the summer of 1825, a body of three to four hundred Cretans, who had fought with other Greeks in the Peloponnese, arrived in Crete and revitalized the Cretan insurgency (the so-called &quot;Gramvousa period&quot;). On 9 August 1825, led by Dimitrios Kallergis and Emmanouil Antoniadis, this group of Cretans captured the fort at Gramvousa and other insurgents captured the fort at Kissamos, and attempted to spread the insurgency further afield.

Although the Ottomans did not manage to retake the forts, they were successful in blocking the spread of the insurgency to the island&#x27;s western provinces. The insurgents were besieged in Gramvousa for more than two years and they had to resort to piracy to survive. Gramvousa became a hive of piratical activity that greatly affected Turkish–Egyptian and European shipping in the region. During that period the population of Gramvousa became organised and built a school and a church dedicated to the &quot;Panagia i Kleftrina&quot; (&quot;Our Lady the piratess&quot;)—St Mary as the patron of the klephts.

In January 1828, the Epirote Hatzimichalis Dalianis landed in Crete with 700 men and in the following March took possession of Frangokastello, a castle in the Sfakia region. Soon the local Ottoman ruler, Mustafa Naili Pasha, attacked Frangokastello with an army of 8,000 men. The castle&#x27;s defence was doomed after a seven-day siege and Dalianis perished along with 385 men. During 1828, Kapodistrias sent Mavrocordatos with British and French fleets to Crete to deal with the klephts and the pirates. This expedition resulted in the destruction of all pirate ships at Gramvousa and the fort came under British command.

=====Macedonia=====
The economic ascent of Thessaloniki and of the other urban centres of Macedonia coincided with the cultural and political renaissance of the Greeks. The ideals and patriotic songs of Rigas Feraios and others had made a profound impression upon the Thessalonians. Α few years later, the revolutionary fervour of the southern Greeks was to spread to these parts, and the seeds of Filiki Eteria were speedily to take root. The leader and coordinator of the revolution in Macedonia was Emmanouel Pappas from the village of Dobista, Serres, who was initiated into the Filiki Eteria in 1819. Pappas had considerable influence over the local Ottoman authorities, especially the local governor, Ismail Bey, and offered much of his personal wealth for the cause.

Following the instructions of Alexander Ypsilantis, that is to prepare the ground and to rouse the inhabitants of Macedonia to rebellion, Pappas loaded arms and munitions from Constantinople on a ship on 23 March and proceeded to Mount Athos, considering that this would be the most suitable spring-board for starting the insurrection. As Vacalopoulos notes, however, &quot;adequate preparations for rebellion had not been made, nor were revolutionary ideals to be reconciled with the ideological world of the monks within the Athonite regime&quot;. On 8 May, the Turks, infuriated by the landing of sailors from Psara at Tsayezi, by the capture of Turkish merchants and the seizure of their goods, rampaged through the streets of Serres, searched the houses of the notables for arms, imprisoned the Metropolitan and 150 merchants, and seized their goods as a reprisal for the plundering by the Psarians.

In Thessaloniki, governor Yusuf Bey (the son of Ismail Bey) imprisoned in his headquarters more than 400 hostages, of whom more than 100 were monks from the monastic estates. He also wished to seize the powerful notables of Polygyros, who got wind of his intentions and fled. On 17 May, the Greeks of Polygyros took up arms, killed the local governor and 14 of his men, and wounded three others; they also repulsed two Turkish detachments. On 18 May, when Yusuf learned of the incidents at Polygyros and the spreading of the insurrection to the villages of Chalkidiki, he ordered half of his hostages to be slaughtered before his eyes. The Mulla of Thessalonica, Hayrıülah, gives the following description of Yusuf&#x27;s retaliations:


It would take until the end of the century for the city&#x27;s Greek community to recover. The revolt, however, gained momentum in Mount Athos and Kassandra, and the island of Thasos joined it. Meanwhile, the revolt in Chalkidiki was progressing slowly and unsystematically. In June 1821 the insurgents tried to cut communications between Thrace and the south, attempting to prevent the &quot;serasker&quot; Haji Muhammad Bayram Pasha from transferring forces from Asia Minor to southern Greece. Even though the rebels delayed him, they were ultimately defeated at the pass of Rentina.

The insurrection in Chalkidiki was, from then on, confined to the peninsulas of Mount Athos and Kassandra. On 30 October 1821, an offensive led by the new Pasha of Thessaloniki, Muhammad Emin Abulubud, resulted in a decisive Ottoman victory at Kassandra. The survivors, among them Pappas, were rescued by the Psarian fleet, which took them mainly to Skiathos, Skopelos and Skyros. However, Pappas died en route to join the revolution at Hydra. Sithonia, Mount Athos and Thasos subsequently surrendered on terms.

Nevertheless, the revolt spread from Central to Western Macedonia, from Olympus to Pieria and Vermion. In the autumn of 1821, Nikolaos Kasomoulis was sent to southern Greece as the &quot;representative of South-East Macedonia&quot;, and met Demetrius Ypsilantis. He then wrote to Papas from Hydra, asking him to visit Olympus to meet the captains there and to &quot;fire them with the required patriotic enthusiasm&quot;. At the beginning of 1822, Anastasios Karatasos and Aggelis Gatsos arranged a meeting with other &quot;armatoloi&quot;; they decided that the insurrection should be based on three towns: Naoussa, Kastania, and Siatista.

In March 1822, Mehmed Emin secured decisive victories at Kolindros and Kastania. Further north, in the vicinity of Naousa, Zafeirakis Theodosiou, Karatasos and Gatsos organized the city&#x27;s defense, and the first clashes resulted in a victory for the Greeks. Mehmed Emin then appeared before the town with 10,000 regular troops and 10,600 irregulars. Failing to get the insurgents to surrender, Mehmed Emin launched a number of attacks pushing them further back and finally captured Naousa in April, helped by the enemies of Zafeirakis, who had revealed an unguarded spot, the &quot;Alonia&quot;. Reprisals and executions ensued, and women are reported to have flung themselves over the Arapitsa waterfall to avoid dishonor and being sold in slavery. Those who broke through the siege of Naousa fell back in Kozani, Siatista and Aspropotamos River, or were carried by the Psarian fleet to the northern Aegean islands.

=====Cyprus=====

On 9 June 1821, 3 ships sailed to Cyprus with Konstantinos Kanaris. They landed at Asprovrisi of Lapithou. Kanaris brought with him papers from the Filiki Etaireia and the ships were welcomed with rapturous applause and patriotic cries from the local Greeks of the area, who helped Kanaris and the soldiers from Cyprus as much as they could.

Kanaris brought with him to mainland Greece, Cypriots who created the &quot;Column of Cypriots&quot; («Φάλαγγα των Κυπρίων»), led by General Chatzipetros, which fought with extraordinary heroism in Greece. In total, over 1000 Cypriots fought in the War of Independence, many of whom died. At Missolonghi many were killed, and at the Battle of Athens in 1827, around 130 were killed. General Chatzipetros, showing military decorations declared &quot;These were given to me by the heroism and braveness of the Column of Cypriots&quot;. In the National Library, there is a list of 580 names of Cypriots who fought in the War between 1821 and 1829.

The Cypriot battalion brought with them their own distinctive war banner, consisting of a white flag with a large blue cross, and the words &quot;GREEK FLAG OF THE MOTHERLAND CYPRUS&quot; emblazoned in the top left corner. The flag was hoisted on a wooden mast, carved and pointed at the end to act as a lance in battle. The legendary battle flag is currently stored at the National Historical Museum of Athens.

Throughout the War of Independence, supplies were brought from Cyprus by the Filiki Etairia to aid the Greek struggle. The Greeks of Cyprus underwent great risk to provide these supplies, and secretly load them onto boats arriving at intervals from Greece, as the Ottoman rulers in Cyprus at the time were very wary of Cypriot insurgency and sentenced to death any Greek Cypriots found aiding the Greek cause. Incidences of these secret loading trips from Cyprus were recorded by the French consul to Cyprus, Mechain.

Back in Cyprus during the war, the local population suffered greatly at the hands of the Ottoman rulers of the islands, who were quick to act with great severity at any act of patriotism and sympathy of the Greeks of Cyprus to the Revolution, fearing a similar uprising in Cyprus. The religious leader of the Greeks of the island at the time, Archbishop Kyprianos was initiated into the Filiki Etairia in 1818 and had promised to aid the cause of the Greek Helladites with food and money.

In early July 1821, the Cypriot Archimandrite Theofylaktos Thiseas arrived in Larnaca as a messenger of the Filiki Etairia, bringing orders to Kyprianos, while proclamations were distributed in every corner of the island. However, the local pasha, Küçük Pasha, intercepted these messages and reacted with fury, calling in reinforcements, confiscating weapons and arresting several prominent Cypriots. Archbishop Kyprianos was urged (by his friends) to leave the island as the situation worsened, but refused to do so.

On 9 July 1821, Pasha had the gates to the walled city of Nicosia closed and executed, by beheading or hanging, 470 important Cypriots amongst them Chrysanthos (bishop of Paphos), Meletios (bishop of Kition) and Lavrentios (bishop of Kyrenia). The next day, all abbots and monks of monasteries in Cyprus were executed. In addition, the Ottomans arrested all the Greek leaders of the villages and imprisoned them before executing them, as they were suspected of inspiring patriotism in their local population.

In total, it is estimated that over 2,000 Greeks of Cyprus were slaughtered as an act of revenge for participating in the revolution. This was a very significant proportion of the total population of the island at the time. Küçük pasha had declared &quot;I have in my mind to slaughter the Greeks in Cyprus, to hang them, to not leave a soul...&quot; before undertaking these massacres. From 9 to 14 July, the Ottomans killed all prisoners on the list of the pasha, and in the next 30 days, looting and massacres spread throughout Cyprus as 4,000 Turkish soldiers from Syria arrived on the island.

Archbishop Kyprianos was defiant in his death. He was aware of his fate and impending death, yet stood by the Greek cause. He is revered throughout Cyprus as a noble patriot and defender of the Orthodox faith and Hellenic cause. An English explorer by the name of Carne spoke to the Archbishop before the events of 9 July, who was quoted as saying: &quot;My death is not far away. I know they [the Ottoman] are waiting for an opportunity to kill me&quot;. Kyprianos chose to stay, despite these fears, and provide protection and counsel for the people of Cyprus as their leader.

He was publicly hanged from a tree opposite the former palace of the Lusignan Kings of Cyprus on 19 July 1821. The events leading up to his execution were documented in an epic poem written in the Cypriot dialect by Vassilis Michaelides.

====War at sea====
From the early stages of the revolution, success at sea was vital for the Greeks. When they failed to counter the Ottoman Navy, it was able to resupply the isolated Ottoman garrisons and land reinforcements from the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s provinces, threatening to crush the rebellion; likewise the failure of the Greek fleet to break the naval blockade of Messolonghi (as it did several times earlier) in 1826 led to the fall of the city.

The Greek fleet was primarily outfitted by prosperous Aegean islanders, principally from the islands of Hydra and Spetses, as well as from Psara. The Albanian-speaking seamen of Hydra and Spetses provided the core of the Greek fleet and leading members of the Greek government, among them a one wartime president. They in some cases used Albanian with each other to prevent others on their side from reading their correspondence. Each island equipped, manned and maintained its own squadron, under its own admiral. Although they were manned by experienced crews, the Greek ships were not designed for warfare, being armed merchantmen equipped with only light guns. Against them stood the Ottoman fleet, which enjoyed several advantages: its ships and supporting craft were built for war; it was supported by the resources of the vast Ottoman Empire; command was centralized and disciplined under the Kapudan Pasha. The total Ottoman fleet size consisted of 20 three-masted ships of the line, each with about 80 guns and 7 or 8 frigates with 50 guns, 5 corvettes with about 30 guns and around 40 brigs with 20 or fewer guns, complemented by squadrons from the Maghrebi vassal states (Algiers, Tripoli and Tunis) and Egypt.
In the face of this situation, the Greeks decided to use fire ships (), which had proven themselves effective for the Psarians during the Orlov Revolt in 1770. The first test was made at Eresos on 27 May 1821, when an Ottoman frigate was successfully destroyed by a fire ship under Dimitrios Papanikolis. In the fire ships, the Greeks found an effective weapon against the Ottoman vessels. In subsequent years, the successes of the Greek fire ships would increase their reputation, with acts such as the destruction of the Ottoman flagship by Konstantinos Kanaris at Chios, after the massacre of the island&#x27;s population in June 1822, acquiring international fame.

At the same time, conventional naval actions were also fought, at which naval commanders like Andreas Miaoulis distinguished themselves. The early successes of the Greek fleet in direct confrontations with the Ottomans at Patras and Spetses gave the crews confidence and contributed greatly to the survival and success of the uprising in the Peloponnese.

Later, however, as Greece became embroiled in a civil war, the Sultan called upon his strongest subject, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, for aid. Plagued by internal strife and financial difficulties in keeping the fleet in constant readiness, the Greeks failed to prevent the capture and destruction of Kasos and Psara in 1824, or the landing of the Egyptian army at Methoni. Despite victories at Samos and Gerontas, the Revolution was threatened with collapse until the intervention of the Great Powers in the Battle of Navarino in 1827.

===1822–1824===

Revolutionary activity was fragmented because of the lack of strong central leadership and guidance. However, the Greek side withstood the Turkish attacks because the Ottoman military campaigns were periodic and the Ottoman presence in the rebel areas was uncoordinated due to logistical problems. The cash-strapped Ottoman state&#x27;s relations with Russia, always difficult, had been made worse by the hanging of Patriarch Grigorios, and the Sublime Porte needed to concentrate substantial forces on the Russian border in case war broke out.

From October 1820 to July 1823, the Ottomans were at war with Persia, and in March 1823 a huge fire at the Tophana military arsenal in Constantinople destroyed much of the Ottoman state&#x27;s supplies of ammunition and its main cannon foundry. Short of men and money, the Ottoman state turned to hiring Albanian tribesmen to fight the Greeks, and by 1823, the bulk of the Ottoman forces in Greece were Albanian mercenaries hired for a campaigning season rather than the Ottoman Army. The Albanian tribesmen, whose style of war was very similar to the Greeks, fought only for money and were liable to go home when not paid or able to plunder in lieu of pay. The Greek military leaders preferred battlefields where they could annihilate the numerical superiority of the opponent, and, at the same time, the lack of artillery hampered Ottoman military efforts.

On 11 April 1822, the Ottoman fleet, under the Kapitan Pasha, Kara Ali, arrived on the island of Chios. The Ottoman sailors and soldiers promptly went on a rampage, killing and raping without mercy, as one contemporary recalled: &quot;Mercy was out of the question, the victors butchering indiscriminately all who came in their way; shrieks rent the air, and the streets were strewn with the dead bodies of old men, women, and children; even the inmates of the hospital, the madhouse and deaf and dumb institution, were inhumanely slaughtered&quot;. Before Kara Ali&#x27;s fleet had arrived, Chios had between 100,000 and 120,000 Greeks living there, of which some 25,000 were killed in the massacre, with another 45,000 (mostly women and children) sold into slavery.

The Chios massacre shocked all of Europe and further increased public sympathy for the Greek cause. The Greeks avenged the massacre on the night of 18 June 1822, when the Ottoman fleet were busy celebrating the end of the sacred Muslim holiday of Ramadan, which the Greek fleet under Admiral Konstantinos Kanaris and Andreas Pipinos took advantage of to launch a fire ship attack. As Kara Ali&#x27;s ship was brightly lit as befitting the Kapitan Pasha, a fire ship under Kanaris was able to strike his ship, causing the Ottoman flagship to blow up. Of the 2,286 or so aboard the flagship, only 180 survived, but many of the dead were Chians enslaved by Kara Ali, who was planning on selling them on the slave markets when he reached Constantinople.

In July 1822, the Greeks and philhellenes at the Battle of Peta under Alexandros Mavrokordatos inflicted much punishment on an Ottoman army commanded by Omer Vrioni, but reflecting the chronic factionalism and disunity that characterized the Greek war effort, were undone when one of the Greek captains, Gogos Bakolas betrayed his own side to the Ottomans, allowing Albanian infantry to advance up the ridge. The battle ended in an Ottoman victory, and with most of the philhellenes killed. The successive military campaigns of the Ottomans in Western and Eastern Greece were repulsed: in 1822, Ottoman Albanian Mahmud Dramali Pasha crossed Roumeli and invaded Morea, but suffered a serious defeat in the Dervenakia. Theodoros Kolokotronis, who annihilated Dramali Pasha&#x27;s army at Dervenakia, became the hero of the hour, attracting much praise all over Greece.

The Greek government had been desperately short of money since the start of the revolution, and in February 1823, the banker Andréas Louriótis arrived in London, seeking a loan from the city. Assisted by the London Greek Committee, which included several MPs and intellectuals, Louriótis began to lobby the city for a loan. British philhellene Edward Blaquiere issued a report in September 1823 which grossly exaggerated Greece&#x27;s economic prosperity and claimed that once independent, Greece would easily become &quot;one of the most opulent nations of Europe&quot;. Blaquiere further assisted the campaign by publishing two books in 1824, in which he claimed: &quot;I should have no hesitation whatever in estimating the physical strength of regenerated Greece to be fully equal to the whole South American continent&quot;, concluding there was &quot;no part of the world...with a more productive soil or happier climate than Greece...Of all the countries or governments who have borrowed money in London within the last ten years...Greece possesses the surest and most ample means of re-payment&quot;.

The 1823 campaign in Western Greece was led by Northern Albanian forces under Mustafa Reshit Pasha from the Pashalik of Scutari, and Southern Albanian forces under Omer Vrioni from the former Pashalik of Yanina. During the summer the Souliot Markos Botsaris was shot dead at the Battle of Karpenisi in his attempt to stop the advance of Ottoman Albanian forces; the announcement of his death in Europe generated a wave of sympathy for the Greek cause. The campaign ended after the Second Siege of Missolonghi in December 1823. In February 1824, the loan for Greece was floated in the city, attracting some £472, 000 pounds sterling (~$17.4 million in 2021), which was money that the Greeks badly needed.

===Revolution in peril and infighting===

The First National Assembly was formed at Epidaurus in late December 1821, consisting almost exclusively of Peloponnesian notables. The Assembly drafted the first Greek Constitution and appointed the members of an executive and a legislative body that were to govern the liberated territories. Mavrokordatos saved the office of president of the executive for himself, while Ypsilantis, who had called for the Assembly, was elected president of the legislative body, a place of limited significance.

Military leaders and representatives of Filiki Eteria were marginalized, but gradually Kolokotronis&#x27; political influence grew, and he soon managed to control, along with the captains he influenced, the Peloponnesian Senate. The central administration tried to marginalize Kolokotronis, who also had under his control the fort of Nafplion. In November 1822, the central administration decided that the new National Assembly would take place in Nafplion, and asked Kolokotronis to return the fort to the government. Kolokotronis refused, and the Assembly was finally gathered in March 1823 in Astros. Central governance was strengthened at the expense of regional bodies, a new constitution was voted, and new members were elected for the executive and the legislative bodies.

Trying to coax the military leaders, the central administration proposed to Kolokotronis that he participate in the executive body as vice-president. Kolokotronis accepted, but he caused a serious crisis when he prevented Mavrokordatos, who had been elected president of the legislative body, from assuming his position. His attitude towards Mavrokordatos caused outrage amongst the members of the legislative body.

The crisis culminated when the legislature, which was controlled by the Roumeliotes and the Hydriots, overturned the executive, and fired its president, Petros Mavromichalis. Kolokotronis and most of the Peloponnesian notables and captains supported Mavromichalis, who remained president of his executive in Tripolitsa. However, a second executive, supported by the islanders, the Roumeliotes, and some Achaean notables—Andreas Zaimis and Andreas Londos were the most prominent—was formed at Kranidi with Kountouriotis as president.

In March 1824, the forces of the new executive besieged Nafplion and Tripolitsa. After one month of fighting and negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kolokotronis, from one side, and Londos and Zaimis, from the other side. On 22 May, the first phase of the civil war officially ended, but most of the members of the new executive were displeased by the moderate terms of the agreement that Londos and Zaimis brokered.

During this period, the two first installments of the English loan had arrived, and the position of the government was strengthened; but the infighting was not yet over. Zaimis and the other Peloponnesians who supported Kountouriotis came into conflict with the executive body, and allied with Kolokotronis, who roused the residents of Tripolitsa against the local tax collectors of the government. Papaflessas and Makriyannis failed to suppress the rebellion, but Kolokotronis remained inactive for some period, overwhelmed by the death of his son, Panos.

The government regrouped its armies, which now consisted mainly of Roumeliotes and Orthodox Christian Albanian Souliotes, led by Ioannis Kolettis, who wanted a complete victory. Under Kolettis&#x27; orders, two bodies of Roumeliotes and Souliotes invaded the Peloponnese: the first under Gouras occupied Corinth and raided the province; the second under Karaiskakis, Kitsos Tzavelas and others, attacked in Achaea, Lindos and &quot;Zaimis&quot;. In January 1825, a Roumeliote force, led by Kolettis himself, arrested Kolokotronis, Deligiannis&#x27; family and others. In May 1825, under the pressure of the Egyptian intervention, those imprisoned were released and granted amnesty.

===Egyptian intervention===


On 19 July 1824, the largest fleet seen in the Mediterranean since Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798 set sail from Alexandria, consisting of 54 warships and 400 transports carrying 14,000 French-trained infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 500 artillerymen, with some 150 cannons. Egyptian intervention was initially limited to Crete and Cyprus. However, the success of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s troops in both places settled the Turks on the horns of a very difficult dilemma, since they were afraid of their wāli&#x27;s expansionist ambitions. Muhammad Ali finally agreed to send his son Ibrahim Pasha to Greece in exchange not only for Crete and Cyprus, but for the Peloponnese and Syria as well.

On 7 February 1825, a second loan to Greece was floated in the City of London. Although the Greek government had squandered the money from the first loan, the second loan was oversubscribed and raised some £1.1 million (~$404 million in 2021). Unlike the first loan, the second loan from the city was to be managed by a Board of Control in London, consisting of the banker Samson Ricardo, two MPs, Edward Ellice and Sir Francis Burdett and John Cam Hobhouse of the London Greek Committee, who were to use the money to buy warships and other supplies, which would then be handed over to the Greeks. After the Greek government had wasted most of the money from the first loan, the City did not trust them to spend the money from the second loan wisely. The Board of Control used the money to hire the naval hero, Lord Cochrane, to command the Greek Navy and to buy steamships. One of the British philhellenes, Frank Abney Hastings believed that the use of mechanised warships powered by steam and using red-hot shot would allow the Greeks to overpower the Ottoman navy, powered as it was by sail. Hastings persuaded the Board of Control to invest in the revolutionary technology of the steamship, making the first use of a mechanised warship in a war. The two loans from the City caused significant financial difficulties for the young nation, and in 1878 a deal was struck between the creditors and the Greek government to reduce the loans, now worth £10 million, with unpaid interest down to 1.5 million pounds sterling.

Ibrahim Pasha landed at Methoni on 24 February 1825, and a month later he was joined by his army of 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry. The Greeks had not expected Ibrahim Pasha to land during the stormy winter weather, and were taken by surprise. The Greeks initially laughed at the Egyptian soldiers, who were short, skinny &quot;fallāḥīn&quot; (peasant) conscripts, many of them blind in one eye owing to the prevalence of parasitic worms that attacked the eye in the Nile, wearing cheap red uniforms comprising a jacket, trousers and a skull-cap. However, the Greeks soon learned that the Egyptians, who were trained by French officers recruited by Mohammed Ali, were tough and hardy soldiers who, unlike the Turkish and Albanian units that the Greeks had been fighting until then, stood their ground in combat. Ibrahim proceeded to defeat the Greek garrison on the small island of Sphacteria off the coast of Messenia. With the Greeks in disarray, Ibrahim ravaged the Western Peloponnese and killed Papaflessas at the Battle of Maniaki. To try to stop Ibrahim, Kanaris led the raid on Alexandria, an attempt to destroy the Egyptian fleet that failed due to a sudden change of the wind. The British traveller and Church of England minister, Reverend Charles Swan, reported Ibrahim Pasha as saying to him that he &quot;would burn and destroy the whole Morea&quot;. Popular opinion in both Greece and the rest of Europe, soon credited Ibrahim Pasha with the so-called &quot;barbarisation project&quot;, where it was alleged that Ibrahim planned to deport the entire Christian Greek population to Egypt as slaves and replace them with Egyptian peasants. It is not clear even today if the &quot;barbarisation project&quot; was a real plan or not, but the possibility that it was created strong demands for humanitarian intervention in Europe. The Porte and Mohammed Ali both denied having plans for the &quot;barbarisation project&quot;, but pointedly refused to put their denials into writing. Russia warned that if the &quot;barbarisation project&quot; was a real plan, then such an egregious violation of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, under which Russia had a vague claim to be the protector of all the Orthodox peoples of the Ottoman Empire, would lead to Russia going to war against the Ottomans. In turn, the British Foreign Secretary George Canning wrote, rather than run the risk of Russia defeating the Ottomans alone, Britain would have to intervene to stop the &quot;barbarisation project&quot; as the British did not wish to see the Russians conquer the Ottoman Empire. While diplomats and statesmen debated what to do in London and St. Petersburg, the Egyptian advance continued in Greece. The Greek government, in an attempt to stop the Egyptians, released Kolokotronis from captivity, but he too was unsuccessful. By the end of June, Ibrahim had captured the city of Argos and was within striking distance of Nafplion. The city was saved by Makriyannis and Dimitrios Ypsilantis who successfully defended Miloi at the outskirts of Nafplion, making the mills outside the town a fortress causing damage to Ibrahim&#x27;s far superior forces who were unable to take the position and eventually left for Tripolitsa. Makriyannis was wounded and was taken aboard by Europeans who were overseeing the battle. Among them was De Rigny, who had an argument with Makriyannis and advised him to quit his weak position but Makriyannis ignored him. Commodore Gawen Hamilton of the Royal Navy, placed his ships in a position which looked like he would assist in the defence of the city.
At the same time, the Turkish armies in Central Greece were besieging the city of Missolonghi for the third time. The siege had begun on 15 April 1825, the day on which Navarino had fallen to Ibrahim. In early autumn, the Greek navy, under the command of Miaoulis forced the Turkish fleet in the Gulf of Corinth to retreat, after attacking it with fire ships. The Turks were joined by Ibrahim in mid-winter, but his army had no more luck in penetrating Missolonghi&#x27;s defences.

In the spring of 1826, Ibrahim managed to capture the marshes around the city, although not without heavy losses. He thus cut the Greeks off from the sea and blocked off their supply route. Although the Egyptians and the Turks offered them terms to stop the attacks, the Greeks refused, and continued to fight. On 22 April, the Greeks decided to sail from the city during the night, with 3,000 men, to cut a path through the Egyptian lines and allow 6,000 women, children and non-combatants to follow. However, a Bulgarian deserter informed Ibrahim of the Greeks&#x27; intention, and he had his entire army deployed; only 1,800 Greeks managed to cut their way through the Egyptian lines. Between 3,000 and 4,000 women and children were enslaved and many of the people who remained behind decided to blow themselves up with gunpowder rather than be enslaved. The news that the Third Siege of Missolonghi had ended in an Ottoman victory sparked horror all over Greece; at the National Assembly, Kolokotronis was giving a speech when the news of Missolonghi&#x27;s fall reached him, leaving him to remember: &quot;the news came to us that Missolonghi was lost. We were all plunged into great grief; for half an hour there was so complete a silence that no one would have thought there was a living soul present; each of us was revolving in his mind how great was our misfortune&quot;. The American philhellene Samuel Gridley Howe, serving as a doctor with the Greeks, wrote back to America: &quot;I write you with an almost breaking heart. Missolonghi has fallen!&quot;, which he called &quot;damning proof of the selfish indifference of the Christian world. You may talk to me of national policy and the necessity of neutrality, but I say, a curse upon such a policy!&quot;. The news of Missolonghi&#x27;s fall had a huge impact on the rest of Europe, sparking a vast outpouring of songs, poems, essays, sermons and plays in Britain, France, Germany and Switzerland, with the recurring image of Missolonghi&#x27;s fall being the murder of a sweet and innocent young Greek woman at the hands of the Turks as a symbol of the unwillingness of the Christian powers of the world to do anything for the Greeks. In May 1826, Hastings arrived in Greece with a British-built steamship, the &quot;Karteria&quot; (Perseverance), which astonished the Greeks to see a ship powered by steam and did not move either via sail or oars. The &quot;Karteria&quot; suffered from constant engine breakdowns, but Hastings was able to use the ship successfully twice over the course of the next two years, at Volos and in the Gulf of Corinth.

Ibrahim sent an envoy to the Maniots demanding that they surrender or else he would ravage their land as he had done to the rest of the Peloponnese. Instead of surrendering, the Maniots simply replied:

Ibrahim tried to enter Mani from the north-east near Almiro on 21 June 1826, but he was forced to stop at the fortifications at Vergas in northern Mani. His army of 7,000 men was held off by an army of 2,000 Maniots and 500 refugees from other parts of Greece until Kolokotronis attacked the Egyptians from the rear and forced them to retreat. The Maniots pursued the Egyptians all the way to Kalamata before returning to Vergas. Simultaneously, Ibrahim sent his fleet further down the Maniot coast in order to outflank the Greek defenders and attack them from the rear. However, when his force landed at Pyrgos Dirou, they were confronted by a group of Maniot women and repelled. Ibrahim again attempted to enter Mani from central Laconia, but again the Maniots defeated the Turkish and Egyptian forces at Polytsaravo. The Maniot victory dealt the death blow to Ibrahim&#x27;s hope of occupying Mani.
The losses Ibrahim Pasha had taken at Missolonghi had greatly reduced his army, and he spent the rest of 1826 chasing the Greek guerillas up and down the mountains. In late June 1826, Reshid Pasha had arrived outside of Athens and laid siege to the city, marking the beginning of the siege of the Acropolis. By the middle of August, only the Acropolis still held out under Yannis Gouras. To break the siege, an attack was launched on Reshid Pasha on 18 August 1826 led by the guerrilla leader Georgios Karaiskakis and the French philhellene Colonel Charles Nicolas Fabvier but were driven off with the loss of some 300 dead. On 13 October 1826, Gouras was killed by an Ottoman sniper and a week later, Yannis Makriyannis was wounded three times in a single day. In December, Febvier was able to infiltrate a force of some 500 men into the Akropolis, bringing in much needed supplies of gunpowder, through he was much offended when the garrison started firing to wake up the Turks, trapping him and his men. In the summer of 1826, the Greek government gave command of its army to the British General Sir Richard Church. The British historian George Finlay wrote: &quot;Church was of a small, well-made, active frame, and of a healthy constitution. His manner was agreeable and easy, with the polish of a great social experience, and the goodness of his disposition was admitted by his enemies, but the strength of his mind was not the quality of which his friends boasted...Both Church and the Greeks misunderstood one another. The Greeks expected Church to prove a Wellington, with a military chest well supplied from the British treasury. Church expected the irregulars of Greece to execute his strategy like regiments of guards&quot;. Church landed in Greece in March 1827, and was welcomed by his old friend Kolokotronis. A week later, Lord Cochrane arrived to take command of the Greek Navy and refused to leave his yacht until the Greeks agreed to form a united government. On 31 March 1827 the Trizina Assembly began its work, drafting a new constitution and offered the presidency of Greece to the former Russian foreign minister, Count Ioannis Kapodistrias. In the meantime, the siege of Athens continued. On 5 February 1827, a force of 2,300 Greeks under the command of Colonel Thomas Gordon landed at Piraeus, and laid siege to the monastery of Ayios Spiridhon, held by Turkish and Albanian troops. In April 1827, Church and Cochrane arrived at Athens and immediately clashed over strategy. When the Ottoman garrison at Ayios Spiridhon surrendered, they were promised safe conduct, but as they were marching out, a shot went off and most of the Ottoman soldiers were killed. Cochrane insisted on a bold but risky plan to stage a night attack across the open plains to break the siege. An operation which launched on 5 May 1827 ended in disaster, as the Greek forces got lost and scattered as the captains quarrelled with one another. This led to a devastating Ottoman cavalry charge in the morning, with Ottomans hunting the scattered Greek forces almost at leisure. On 5 June 1827, the Acropolis surrendered in the last Ottoman victory of the war.

Kapodistrias arrived in Greece to become the Governor on 28 January 1828. The first task of Greece&#x27;s new leader was to create a state and a civil society, which the workaholic Kapodistrias toiled at mightily, working from 5 am until 10 pm every night. Kapodistrias alienated many with his haughty, high-handed manner and his open contempt for most of the Greek elite, but he attracted support from several of the captains, such as Theodoros Kolokotronis and Yannis Makriyannis who provided the necessary military force to back up Kapodistrias&#x27;s decisions. As a former Russian foreign minister, Kapodistrias was well connected to the European elite and he attempted to use his connections to secure loans for the new Greek state and to achieve the most favorable borders for Greece, which was being debated by Russian, French and British diplomats.

===Foreign intervention against the Ottomans===
====Initial hostility====
When the news of the Greek Revolution was first received, the reaction of the European powers was uniformly hostile. They recognized the degeneration of the Ottoman Empire, but they did not know how to handle this situation (a problem known as the &quot;Eastern Question&quot;). Afraid of the complications the partition of the empire might raise, the British foreign minister Viscount Castlereagh, Austrian foreign minister Prince Metternich, and the Tsar of Russia Alexander I shared the same view concerning the necessity of preserving the &quot;status quo&quot; and the peace of Europe. They also pleaded that they maintain the Concert of Europe.

Metternich also tried to undermine the Russian foreign minister, Ioannis Kapodistrias, who was of Greek origin. Kapodistrias demanded that Alexander declare war on the Ottomans in order to liberate Greece and increase the greatness of Russia. Metternich persuaded Alexander that Kapodistrias was in league with the Italian Carbonari (an Italian revolutionary group), leading Alexander to disavow him. As a result of the Russian reaction to Alexander Ypsilantis, Kapodistrias resigned as foreign minister and moved to Switzerland.

Nevertheless, Alexander&#x27;s position was ambivalent, since he regarded himself as the protector of the Orthodox Church, and his subjects were deeply moved by the hanging of the Patriarch. These factors explain why, after denouncing the Greek Revolution, Alexander dispatched an ultimatum to Constantinople on 27 July 1821, after the Greek massacres in the city and the hanging of the Patriarch.

However, the danger of war passed temporarily, after Metternich and Castlereagh persuaded the Sultan to make some concessions to the Tsar. On 14 December 1822, the Holy Alliance denounced the Greek Revolution, considering it audacious.

====Change of stance====
In August 1822, George Canning was appointed by the British government as Foreign Secretary, succeeding Castlereagh. Canning was influenced by the mounting popular agitation against the Ottomans, and believed that a settlement could no longer be postponed. He also feared that Russia might undertake unilateral action against the Ottoman Empire.

In March 1823, Canning declared that &quot;when a whole nation revolts against its conqueror, the nation cannot be considered as piratical but as a nation in a state of war&quot;. In February 1823 he notified the Ottoman Empire that Britain would maintain friendly relations with the Turks only under the condition that the latter respected the Christian subjects of the Empire. The Commissioner of the Ionian Islands, which were a British colony, was ordered to consider the Greeks in a state of war and give them the right to cut off certain areas from which the Turks could get provisions.

These measures led to the increase of British influence. This influence was reinforced by the issuing of two loans that the Greeks managed to conclude with British fund-holders in 1824 and 1825. These loans, which, in effect, made the City of London the financier of the revolution, inspired the creation of the &quot;British&quot; political party in Greece, whose opinion was that the revolution could only end in success with the help of Britain. At the same time, parties affiliated to Russia and France made their appearance. These parties would later strive for power during king Otto&#x27;s reign.

When Tsar Nicholas I succeeded Alexander in December 1825, Canning decided to act immediately: he sent the Duke of Wellington to Russia, and the outcome was the Protocol of St Petersburg of 4 April 1826. According to the protocol, the two powers agreed to mediate between the Ottomans and the Greeks on the basis of complete autonomy of Greece under Turkish sovereignty. The Anglo-Russian protocol that Wellington negotiated with Nicholas in St. Petersburg attracted much scorn from Metternich, who was consistently the most pro-Ottoman and anti-Greek European statesmen. Metternich dismissively wrote, &quot;If the Irish were to revolt against the British Crown, and the King of France were to offer to mediate,&quot; leading him to ask: &quot;Is England then ready to regard as a Power equal to rights to that of the [British] King the first Irish Club which declares itself the Insurgent Government of Ireland? To regard as justified the French Power which would accept the office of mediator, by reason of the sole fact that the invitation had been addressed to it by the Irish Government?...Whither does this absurdity not lead us?&quot;. Prussia, whose king Frederich Wilhelm was close to Metternich, chose to follow the Austrian lead. Before he met with Wellington, the Tsar had already sent an ultimatum to the Porte, demanding that the principalities be evacuated immediately, and that plenipotentiaries be sent to Russia to settle outstanding issues. The Sultan agreed to send the plenipotentiaries, and on 7 October 1826 signed the Akkerman Convention, in which Russian demands concerning Serbia and the principalities were accepted.

The Greeks formally applied for the mediation provided in the Petersburg Protocol, while the Turks and the Egyptians showed no willingness to stop fighting. France, which initially backed its client Muhammad Ali the Great with weapons and officers to train his army, changed its stance, partly because of the pro-Greek feelings of the French people, and partly because King Charles X saw the offer to impose mediation as a way of assuring French influence in Greece. Since Britain and Russia were going ahead with their plans to impose mediation with or without France, if the French declined the offer to impose mediation, Greece would be in the Anglo-Russian sphere of influence, while if the French did take part, then Greece would also be in the French sphere of influence. Canning therefore prepared for action by negotiating the Treaty of London (6 July 1827) with France and Russia. This provided that the Allies should again offer negotiations, and if the Sultan rejected it, they would exert all the means which circumstances would allow to force the cessation of hostilities. Meanwhile, news reached Greece in late July 1827 that Muhammad Ali&#x27;s new fleet was completed in Alexandria and sailing towards Navarino to join the rest of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet. The aim of this fleet was to attack Hydra and knock the island&#x27;s fleet out of the war. On 29 August, the Porte formally rejected the Treaty of London&#x27;s stipulations, and, subsequently, the commanders-in-chief of the British and French Mediterranean fleets, Admiral Edward Codrington and Admiral Henri de Rigny, sailed into the Gulf of Argos and requested to meet with Greek representatives on board .

====Battle of Navarino (1827)====

After the Greek delegation, led by Mavrocordatos, accepted the terms of the treaty, the Allies prepared to insist upon the armistice, and their fleets were instructed to intercept supplies destined for Ibrahim&#x27;s forces. When Muhammad Ali&#x27;s fleet, which had been warned by the British and French to stay away from Greece, left Alexandria and joined other Ottoman/Egyptian units at Navarino on 8 September, Codrington arrived with his squadron off Navarino on 12 September. On 13 October, Codrington was joined, off Navarino, by his allied support, a French squadron under De Rigny and a Russian squadron under Login Geiden.

Upon their arrival at Navarino, Codgrinton and de Rigny tried to negotiate with Ibrahim, but Ibrahim insisted that by the Sultan&#x27;s order he must destroy Hydra. Codrington responded by saying that if Ibrahim&#x27;s fleets attempted to go anywhere but home, he would have to destroy them. Ibrahim agreed to write to the Sultan to see if he would change his orders, but he also complained about the Greeks being able to continue their attacks. Codrington promised that he would stop the Greeks and Philhellenes from attacking the Turks and Egyptians. After doing this, he disbanded most of his fleet, which returned to Malta, while the French went to the Aegean.

However, when Frank Hastings, a Philhellene, destroyed a Turkish naval squadron during a raid off Itea, Ibrahim sent a detachment of his fleet out of Navarino in order to defeat Hastings. Codrington had not heard of Hastings&#x27;s actions and thought that Ibrahim was breaking his agreement. Codrington intercepted the force and made them retreat and did so again on the following day when Ibrahim led the fleet in person. Codrington assembled his fleet once more, with the British returning from Malta and the French from the Aegean. They were also joined by the Russian contingent led by Count Login Geiden. Ibrahim now began a campaign to annihilate the Greeks of the Peloponnese as he thought the Allies had reneged on their agreement.

On 20 October 1827, as the weather got worse, the British, Russian and French fleets entered the Bay of Navarino in peaceful formation to shelter themselves and to make sure that the Egyptian-Turkish fleet did not slip off and attack Hydra. When a British frigate sent a boat to request the Egyptians to move their fire ships, the officer on board was shot by the Egyptians. The frigate responded with musket fire in retaliation and an Egyptian ship fired a cannon shot at the French flagship, the Sirene, which returned fire. A full engagement was begun which ended in a complete victory for the Allies and in the annihilation of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet. Of the 89 Egyptian-Turkish ships that took part in the battle, only 14 made it back to Alexandria and their dead amounted to over 8,000. The Allies did not lose a ship and suffered only 181 deaths. The Porte demanded compensation from the Allies for the ships, but his demand was refused on the grounds that the Turks had acted as the aggressors. The three countries&#x27; ambassadors also left Constantinople.

In Britain, the battle received a mixed reception. The British public, many of them Philhellenes, were overjoyed at the outcome of the battle which all but confirmed the independence of Greece. But in Whitehall, senior naval and diplomatic echelons were appalled by the outcome of his campaign. It was considered that Codrington had grossly exceeded his instructions by provoking a showdown with the Ottoman fleet, and that his actions had gravely compromised the Ottoman ability to resist Russian encroachment. At a social event, King George IV was reported as referring to the battle as &quot;this untoward event&quot;. In France, the news of the battle was greeted with great enthusiasm and the government had an unexpected surge in popularity. Russia formally took the opportunity to declare war on the Turks (April 1828).
In October 1828, the Greeks regrouped and formed a new government under Kapodistrias. Kapodistrias took advantage of the Russo-Turkish war and sent troops of the reorganised Hellenic Army to Central Greece. They advanced to seize as much territory as possible, including Athens and Thebes, before the Western powers imposed a ceasefire. These Greek victories were proved decisive for the including of more territories in the future State. As far as the Peloponnese was concerned, Britain and Russia accepted the offer of France to send an army to expel Ibrahim&#x27;s forces. Nicolas Joseph Maison, who was given command of a French expeditionary Corps of 15,000 men, landed on 30 August 1828 at Petalidi and helped the Greeks evacuate the Peloponnese from all the hostile troops by 30 October. Maison thus implemented the convention Codrington had negotiated and signed in Alexandria with Muhammad Ali, which provided for the withdrawal of all Egyptian troops from the Peloponnese. The French troops, whose military engineers also helped rebuild the Peloponnese, were accompanied by seventeen distinguished scientists of the scientific expedition of Morea (botany, zoology, geology, geography, archaeology, architecture and sculpture), whose work was of major importance for the building of the new independent State. The French troops definitely left Greece after five years, in 1833.

The final major engagement of the war was the Battle of Petra, which occurred north of Attica. Greek forces under Demetrius Ypsilantis, for the first time trained to fight as a regular European army rather than as guerrilla bands, advanced against Aslan Bey&#x27;s forces and defeated them. The Turks surrendered all lands from Livadeia to the Spercheios River in exchange for safe passage out of Central Greece. As George Finlay stresses: &quot;Thus Prince Demetrios Ypsilantis had the honor of terminating the war which his brother had commenced on the banks of the Pruth.&quot;

====Autonomy to independence====
In September 1828, the Conference of Poros opened to discuss what should be the borders of Greece. On 21 December 1828, the ambassadors of Britain, Russia, and France met on the island of Poros and prepared a protocol, which provided for the creation of an autonomous state ruled by a monarch, whose authority should be confirmed by a firman of the Sultan. The proposed borderline ran from Arta to Volos, and, despite Kapodistrias&#x27; efforts, the new state would include only the islands of the Cyclades, the Sporades, Samos, and maybe Crete. The Sublime Porte, which had rejected the call for an armistice in 1827, now rejected the conclusions of the Poros conference, with the Sultan Mahmud II saying he would never grant Greece independence, and the war would go on until he reconquered all of Greece. Based on the Protocol of Poros, the London Conference agreed on the protocol of 22 March 1829, which accepted most of the ambassadors&#x27; proposals but drew the borders farther south than the initial proposal and did not include Samos and Crete in the new state.

Under pressure from Russia, the Porte finally agreed on the terms of the Treaty of London of 6 July 1827 and of the Protocol of 22 March 1829. Soon afterward, Britain and France conceived the idea of an independent Greek state, trying to limit the influence of Russia on the new state. Russia disliked the idea but could not reject it, and consequently the three powers finally agreed to create an independent Greek state under their joint protection, concluding the protocols of 3 February 1830.

By one of the protocols, the Greek throne was initially offered to Leopold, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the future King of Belgium. Discouraged by the gloomy picture painted by Kapodistrias, and unsatisfied with the Aspropotamos-Zitouni borderline, which replaced the more favorable line running from Arta to Volos considered by the Great Powers earlier, he refused. Negotiations temporarily stalled after Kapodistrias was assassinated in 1831 in Nafplion by the Mavromichalis clan, after having demanded that they unconditionally submit to his authority. When they refused, Kapodistrias put Petrobey in jail, sparking vows of vengeance from his clan.

The withdrawal of Leopold as a candidate for the throne of Greece and the July Revolution in France further delayed the final settlement of the new kingdom&#x27;s frontiers until a new government was formed in Britain. Lord Palmerston, who took over as British Foreign Secretary, agreed to the Arta–Volos borderline. However, the secret note on Crete, which the Bavarian plenipotentiary communicated to Britain, France and Russia, bore no fruit.

In May 1832, Palmerston convened the London Conference. The three Great Powers, Britain, France and Russia, offered the throne to the Bavarian prince, Otto of Wittelsbach; meanwhile, the Fifth National Assembly at Nafplion had approved the choice of Otto, and passed the Constitution of 1832 (which would come to be known as the &quot;Hegemonic Constitution&quot;). As co-guarantors of the monarchy, the Great Powers also agreed to guarantee a loan of 60 million francs to the new king, empowering their ambassadors in the Ottoman capital to secure the end of the war. Under the protocol signed on 7 May 1832 between Bavaria and the protecting powers, Greece was defined as a &quot;monarchical and independent state&quot; but was to pay an indemnity to the Porte. The protocol outlined the way in which the Regency was to be managed until Otto reached his majority, while also concluding the second Greek loan for a sum of £2.4 million.

On 21 July 1832, British Ambassador to the Sublime Porte Sir Stratford Canning and the other representatives of the Great Powers signed the Treaty of Constantinople, which defined the boundaries of the new Greek Kingdom at the Arta–Volos line. The borders of the kingdom were reiterated in the London Protocol of 30 August 1832, also signed by the Great Powers, which ratified the terms of the Constantinople arrangement.

===Massacres===

Almost as soon as the revolution began, there were large scale massacres of civilians by both Greek revolutionaries and Ottoman authorities. Greek revolutionaries massacred Jews, Muslims, and Christians suspected of Ottoman sympathies alike, mainly in the Peloponnese and Attica where Greek forces were dominant. The Turks massacred Greeks identified with the revolution, especially in Anatolia, Crete, Constantinople, Cyprus, Macedonia and the Aegean islands. They also massacred unarmed Greeks in places which did not revolt, as in Smyrna and in Constantinople.

Some of the more infamous atrocities include the Chios Massacre, the Constantinople Massacre, the Destruction of Psara, Massacre of Samothrace (1821), Kasos Massacre, Naousa massacre, Third siege of Missolonghi, the massacres following the Tripolitsa Massacre, and the Navarino Massacre. There is debate among scholars over whether the massacres committed by the Greeks should be regarded as a response to prior events (such as the massacre of the Greeks of Tripoli, after the failed Orlov Revolt of 1770 and the destruction of the Sacred Band) or as separate atrocities, which started simultaneously with the outbreak of the revolt.

During the war, tens of thousands of Greek civilians were killed, left to die or taken into slavery. Most of the Greeks in the Greek quarter of Constantinople were massacred. A large number of Christian clergymen were also killed, including the Ecumenical Patriarch Gregory V.

Sometimes marked as allies of the Turks in the Peloponnese, Jewish settlements were also massacred by Greek revolutionaries; Steve Bowman argues that the tragedy may have been more a side-effect of the butchering of the Turks of Tripolis, the last Ottoman stronghold in the South, where the Jews had taken refuge from the fighting, than a specific action against Jews as such. Many Jews around Greece and throughout Europe were supporters of the Greek revolt, using their resources to loan substantial amounts to the newly formed Greek government. In turn, the success of the Greek Revolution was to stimulate the incipient stirrings of Jewish nationalism, later called Zionism.

==Aftermath==
The consequences of the Greek revolution were somewhat ambiguous in the immediate aftermath. An independent Greek state had been established, but Britain, Russia and France still had significant influence in Greek politics, selecting an imported Bavarian prince as ruler. The country had been ravaged by ten years of fighting and was full of displaced refugees and empty Turkish estates, necessitating a series of land reforms over several decades.

The population of the new state numbered 800,000, representing less than one-third of the 2.5 million Greek inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire. During a great part of the next century, the Greek state sought the liberation of the &quot;unredeemed&quot; Greeks of the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the Megali Idea, i.e., the goal of uniting all Greeks in one country.

As a people, the Greeks no longer provided the princes for the Danubian Principalities, and were regarded within the Ottoman Empire, especially by the Muslim population, as traitors. Phanariotes, who had until then held high office within the Ottoman Empire, were thenceforth regarded as suspect, and lost their special, privileged status. In Constantinople and the rest of the Ottoman Empire where Greek banking and merchant presence had been dominant, Armenians mostly replaced Greeks in banking, and Jewish merchants gained importance.

The war would prove a seminal event in the history of the Ottoman Empire, despite the small size and the impoverishment of the new Greek state. For the first time, a Christian subject people had achieved independence from Ottoman rule and established a fully independent state, recognized by Europe. Whereas previously only large nations (such as the Prussians or Austrians) had been judged worthy of national self-determination by the great powers, the Greek revolt legitimized the concept of small nation-states, and emboldened nationalist movements among other subject peoples of the Ottoman Empire.

Shortly after the war ended, the people of the Russian-dependent Poland, encouraged by the Greek victory, started the November Uprising, hoping to regain their independence. This uprising failed however, and Polish independence would not be restored until 1918 at Versailles.

The newly established Greek state would pursue further expansion and, over the course of a century, parts of Macedonia, Crete, parts of Epirus, many Aegean Islands, the Ionian Islands and other Greek-speaking territories would unite with the new Greek state.

===Music inspired by the Greek War of Independence===
In 1971, the Municipality of Thessaloniki commissioned a symphonic work for the 150th anniversary of the Greek Revolution. Nicolas Astrinidis&#x27; choral &quot;Symphony &quot;1821&quot;&quot; was premiered on 27 October 1971 at the 6th &quot;Demetria&quot;.


After nearly four hundred years of foreign rule, Greeks often used music and poetry as a means of empowerment in the war. Rigas Feraios (1757–1798) was a very prominent poet and intellectual of the Greek independence movement. Many of his poems urged the people of Greece to leave the cities, head to the mountains where they would have more freedom, and unite to gain their independence.

Dionysios Solomos (1798–1857) was another national poet inspired by the Greek War of Independence. Solomos wrote the &quot;Hymn to Liberty&quot;, now the national anthem, in 1823, two years after the Greeks started the war against the Ottoman Empire. The poem itself is 158 stanzas, but officially only the first two are the anthem. It is the national anthem not only of Greece but also of Cyprus, which adopted it in 1966.

To this day, many songs are sung by Greeks worldwide on 25 March to celebrate their liberation and showcase their respect for the lives that were lost during the four hundred years of Ottoman rule.

<text>Checkpoint Charlie (or &quot;Checkpoint C&quot;) was the Western Allies&#x27; name for the best-known Berlin Wall crossing point between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War (1947–1991), becoming a symbol of the Cold War, representing the separation of East and West.

East German leader Walter Ulbricht agitated and manoeuvred to get the Soviet Union&#x27;s permission to construct the Berlin Wall in 1961 to prevent emigration and defection from East Berlin and the wider German Democratic Republic into West Berlin. 

Soviet and American tanks briefly faced each other at the location during the Berlin Crisis of 1961. On 26 June 1963, U.S. President John F. Kennedy visited Checkpoint Charlie and looked from a platform onto the Berlin Wall and into East Berlin, the same day he gave his famous Ich bin ein Berliner speech.

After the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc and the reunification of Germany, the American guard house at Checkpoint Charlie became a tourist attraction. It is now located in the Allied Museum in the Dahlem neighborhood of Berlin.

==Background==
===Emigration restrictions, the Inner German border and Berlin===

Between 1949 and 1961, over 2½ million East Germans fled to the West. The numbers increased during the three years before the Berlin Wall was erected, with 144,000 in 1959, 199,000 in 1960 and 207,000 in the first seven months of 1961 alone. The 3.5 million East Germans who had left by 1961 totaled approximately 20% of the entire East German population.

The emigrants tended to be young and well educated, including many professionals — engineers, technicians, physicians, teachers, lawyers and skilled workers.The brain drain became damaging to the political credibility and economic viability of East Germany. 

By the early 1950s, the Soviet method of restricting emigration was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc, including East Germany. However, in occupied Germany, until 1952, the lines between East Germany and the western occupied zones remained easily crossed in most places. Subsequently, the inner German border between the two German states was closed and a barbed-wire fence erected.

Even after closing of the inner German border officially in 1952, the city sector border in between East Berlin and West Berlin remained considerably more accessible than the rest of the border because it was administered by all four occupying powers, so Berlin became the main route by which East Germans left for the West.

===Berlin Wall constructed===

On 13 August 1961, a barbed-wire barrier that would become the Berlin Wall separating East and West Berlin was erected by the East Germans. Two days later, police and army engineers began to construct a more permanent concrete wall. Along with the wall, the 830-mile (1336 km) zonal border became 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide on its East German side in some parts of Germany with a tall steel-mesh fence running along a &quot;death strip&quot; bordered by mines, as well as channels of ploughed earth, to slow escapees and more easily reveal their footprints.

==Checkpoint==

Checkpoint Charlie was a crossing point in the Berlin Wall located at the junction of with and (which for older historical reasons coincidentally means &quot;Wall Street&quot;). It is in the Friedrichstadt neighborhood. Checkpoint Charlie was designated as the single foot or car crossing point for foreigners and members of the Allied forces, who were not allowed to use the other sector crossing point designated for use by foreigners, the Friedrichstraße railway station.

The name &quot;Charlie&quot; came from the letter C in the NATO phonetic alphabet; similarly for other Allied checkpoints on the &quot;Autobahn&quot; from the West: Checkpoint Alpha at Helmstedt and its counterpart Checkpoint Bravo at Dreilinden, Wannsee in the south-west corner of Berlin. The Soviets simply called it the &quot; Crossing Point&quot; (, ). The East Germans referred officially to Checkpoint Charlie as the (&quot;Border Crossing Point&quot;) .

As the most visible Berlin Wall checkpoint, Checkpoint Charlie was featured in movies and books. A famous cafe and viewing place for Allied officials, armed forces and visitors alike, (&quot;Eagle Café&quot;), was situated right on the checkpoint.

The development of the infrastructure around the checkpoint was largely asymmetrical, reflecting the contrary priorities of East German and Western border authorities. During its 28-year active life, the infrastructure on the Eastern side was expanded to include not only the wall, watchtower and zig-zag barriers, but a multi-lane shed where cars and their occupants were checked. However, the Allied authority never erected any permanent buildings. A wooden shed used as the guard house was replaced during the 1980s by a larger metal structure, now displayed at the Allied Museum in western Berlin. Their reasoning was that they did not consider the inner Berlin sector boundary an international border and did not treat it as such.

===Stand-off between Soviet and U.S. tanks in October 1961===
Soon after the construction of the Berlin Wall in August 1961, a stand-off occurred between US and Soviet tanks on either side of Checkpoint Charlie. It began on 22 October as a dispute over whether East German border guards were authorized to examine the travel documents of a US diplomat based in West Berlin named Allan Lightner heading to East Berlin to watch an opera show.

According to the agreement between all four Allied powers occupying Germany, there was to be free movement for Allied forces in all of Berlin, and no German military forces from either West Germany or East Germany were to be based in the city. The Western Allies also did not initially recognise the East German state and its right to remain in its self-declared capital of East Berlin, and only recognised the authority of the Soviets over East Berlin.

By 27 October, ten Soviet and an equal number of American tanks stood 100 yards apart on either side of the checkpoint. This stand-off ended peacefully on 28 October following a US-Soviet understanding to withdraw tanks and reduce tensions. Discussions between US Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and Soviet intelligence officer Georgi Bolshakov played a vital role in realizing this tacit agreement.

===Early escapes===
The Berlin Wall was erected with great speed by the East German government in 1961, but there were initially many means of escape that had not been anticipated. For example, Checkpoint Charlie was initially blocked only by a gate, and a citizen of the GDR (East Germany) smashed a car through it to escape, so a strong pole was erected. Another escapee approached the barrier in a convertible, the windscreen removed prior to the event, and slipped under the barrier. This was repeated two weeks later, so the East Germans duly lowered the barrier and added uprights.

===Death of Peter Fechter===
On 17 August 1962, a teenaged East German, Peter Fechter, was shot in the pelvis by East German guards while trying to escape from East Berlin. His body lay tangled in a barbed wire fence as he bled to death in full view of the world&#x27;s media. He could not be rescued from West Berlin because he was a few metres inside the Soviet sector. East German border guards were reluctant to approach him for fear of provoking Western soldiers, one of whom had shot an East German border guard just days earlier. More than an hour later, Fechter&#x27;s body was removed by the East German guards. A spontaneous demonstration formed on the American side of the checkpoint, protesting against the action of the East and the inaction of the West.

A few days later, a crowd threw stones at Soviet buses driving towards the Soviet War Memorial, located in the Tiergarten in the British sector; the Soviets tried to escort the buses with armoured personnel carriers (APCs). Thereafter, the Soviets were only allowed to cross via the Sandkrug Bridge crossing (which was the nearest to Tiergarten) and were prohibited from bringing APCs. Western units were deployed in the middle of the night in early September with live armaments and vehicles, in order to enforce the ban.

==Today: Tourist and memorial site==

Although the wall was opened in November 1989 and the checkpoint booth removed on 22 June 1990, the checkpoint remained an official crossing for foreigners and diplomats until German reunification in October 1990.

Checkpoint Charlie has since become one of Berlin&#x27;s primary tourist attractions, where some original remnants of the border crossing blend with reconstructed parts, memorial and tourist facilities.

The guard house on the American side was removed in 1990; it is now on display in the open-air museum of the Allied Museum in Berlin-Zehlendorf. A copy of the guard house and the sign that once marked the border crossing was reconstructed later on roughly the same site. It resembles the first guard house erected during 1961, behind a sandbag barrier toward the border. Over the years this was replaced several times by guard houses of different sizes and layouts. The one removed in 1990 was considerably larger than the first one and did not have sandbags.

Tourists used to be able to have their photographs taken for a fee with actors dressed somewhat as Allied military police standing in front of the guard house but Berlin authorities banned the practice in November 2019 stating the actors had been exploiting tourists by demanding money for photos at the attraction.

The course of the former wall and border is now marked in the street with a line of cobblestones. An open-air exhibition was opened during the summer of 2006. Gallery walls along Friedrichstraße and Zimmerstraße give information about escape attempts, how the checkpoint was expanded, and its significance during the Cold War, including the confrontation of Soviet and American tanks in 1961, and an overview of other important memorial sites and museums about the division of Germany and the wall.

Developers demolished the last surviving major original Checkpoint Charlie structure, the East German watchtower, in 2000, to make way for offices and shops. The city tried to save the tower but failed, as it was not classified as a historic landmark, but the development was never realised.

New plans since 2017 for a hotel on the site stirred a professional and political debate about appropriate development of the area. After the final listing of the site as a protected heritage area in 2018, plans were changed towards a more heritage-friendly approach, but the area between Zimmerstraße and Mauerstraße/Schützenstraße remains vacant, providing space for a number of temporary tourist and memorial uses.

===BlackBox Cold War Exhibition===
The &quot;BlackBox Cold War&quot; exhibition has illuminated the division of Germany and Berlin since 2012. The free open-air exhibition offers original Berlin Wall segments and information about the historic site. However, the indoor exhibition (entrance fee required) illustrates Berlin&#x27;s contemporary history with 16 media stations, a movie theatre and original objects and documents. It is run by the NGO &quot;Berliner Forum fuer Geschichte und Gegenwart e.V..&quot;

===Checkpoint Charlie Museum===

Near the location of the guard house is the &quot;Haus am Checkpoint Charlie&quot;. The &quot;Mauermuseum - Museum Haus am Checkpoint Charlie&quot; was opened on 14 June 1963 in the immediate vicinity of the Berlin Wall. It shows photographs and fragments related to the separation of Germany. The border fortifications and the &quot;assistance of the protecting powers&quot; are illustrated. In addition to photos and documentation of successful escape attempts, the exhibition also showcases escape devices including a hot-air balloon, escape cars, chair lifts, and a mini-submarine.

From October 2004 until July 2005, the Freedom Memorial, consisting of original wall segments and 1,067 commemorative crosses, stood on a leased site.

The museum is operated by the &quot;Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August e. V.&quot;, a registered association founded by Dr. Rainer Hildebrandt. The director is Alexandra Hildebrandt, the founder&#x27;s widow. The museum is housed in part in the &quot;House at Checkpoint Charlie&quot; building by architect Peter Eisenman.

With 850,000 visitors in 2007, the Checkpoint Charlie Museum is one of the most visited museums in Berlin and in Germany.

==In popular culture==
Checkpoint Charlie figures in numerous Cold War-era espionage and political novels and films.

===Film===
Checkpoint Charlie is featured in the opening scene of the 1965 film &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; (starring Richard Burton and Claire Bloom), based on the John le Carré novel of the same name, which does not use the checkpoint.

James Bond (played by Roger Moore) passed through Checkpoint Charlie in the film &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983) from West to East.

The 1985 film &quot;Gotcha!&quot; includes a scene where the protagonist (Anthony Edwards) transits through Checkpoint Charlie into West Berlin.

In the feature film &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot;, imprisoned American student Frederic Pryor is released at Checkpoint Charlie as part of a deal to trade Pryor and U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers for convicted Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. Pryor&#x27;s release happens offscreen while the trade of Powers for Abel takes place at the Glienicke Bridge.

It was depicted in the opening scene of the film &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E&quot; (2015).

===Music===
Elvis Costello mentions Checkpoint Charlie in his hit song &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot;.

The song &quot;Checkpoint Charlie&quot; from Steven Van Zandt&#x27;s 1984 album Voice of America makes a plea for the wall to be torn down.

The 69 Eyes mentions Checkpoint Charlie in their song &quot;Feel Berlin&quot;, from the album &quot;Devils&quot;.

== Trivia ==
At the border crossing from Hyder in Alaska, USA to Stewart in British Columbia, Canada, there is a humorous imitation of the Checkpoint Charlie sign with the inscription &quot;You are leaving the American Sector&quot; in English, French, and German, as well as a sign reading &quot;Eastern Sektor&quot;, as Stewart is located east of Hyder. Hyder is the only place in the USA that can be legally entered without any border control. The sign was erected in 2015 as a protest after the Canadian administration announced plans to close the border control at night.

<doc id="200992" wikidata="Q3316326" url="?curid=200992" title="Asynchronous serial communication">
<text>Asynchronous serial communication is a form of serial communication in which the communicating endpoints&#x27; interfaces are not continuously synchronized by a common clock signal. Instead of a common synchronization signal, the data stream contains synchronization information in form of start and stop signals, before and after each unit of transmission, respectively. The start signal prepares the receiver for arrival of data and the stop signal resets its state to enable triggering of a new sequence.

A common kind of start-stop transmission is ASCII over RS-232, for example for use in teletypewriter operation.

== Origin ==
Mechanical teleprinters using 5-bit codes (see Baudot code) typically used a stop period of 1.5 bit times. Very early electromechanical teletypewriters (pre-1930) could require 2 stop bits to allow mechanical impression without buffering. Hardware which does not support fractional stop bits can communicate with a device that uses 1.5 bit times if it is configured to send 2 stop bits when transmitting and requiring 1 stop bit when receiving.

The format is derived directly from the design of the teletypewriter, which was designed this way because the electromechanical technology of its day was not precise enough for synchronous operation: thus the systems needed to be re-synchronized at the start of each character. Having been re-synchronized, the technology of the day was good enough to preserve bit-sync for the remainder of the character. The stop bits gave the system time to recover before the next start bit. Early teleprinter systems used five data bits, typically with some variant of the Baudot code.

Very early experimental printing telegraph devices used only a start bit and required manual adjustment of the receiver mechanism speed to reliably decode characters. Automatic synchronization was required to keep the transmitting and receiving units &quot;in step&quot;. This was finally achieved by Howard Krum, who patented the start-stop method of synchronization (, granted September 19, 1916, then , granted December 3, 1918). Shortly afterward a practical teleprinter was patented (, granted July 3, 1917).

== Operation ==
Before signaling will work, the sender and receiver must agree on the signaling parameters:

* Full or half-duplex operation
* The number of bits per character -- currently almost always 8-bit characters, but historically some transmitters have used a five-bit character code, six-bit character code, or a 7-bit ASCII.
* Endianness: the order in which the bits are sent
* The speed or bits per second of the line (equal to the Baud rate when each symbol represents one bit). Some systems use automatic speed detection, also called automatic baud rate detection.
* Whether to use or not use parity
* Odd or even parity, if used
* The number of stop bits sent must be chosen (the number sent must be at least what the receiver needs)
* Mark and space symbols (current directions in early telegraphy, later voltage polarities in EIA RS-232 and so on, frequency-shift polarities in frequency-shift keying and so on)

Asynchronous start-stop signaling was widely used for dial-up modem access to time-sharing computers and BBS systems. These systems used either seven or eight data bits, transmitted least-significant bit first, in accordance with the ASCII standard.

Between computers, the most common configuration used was &quot;8N1&quot;: eight-bit characters, with one start bit, one stop bit, and no parity bit. Thus 10 Baud times are used to send a single character, and so dividing the signaling bit-rate by ten results in the overall transmission speed in characters per second.

Asynchronous start-stop is the lower data-link layer used to connect computers to modems for many dial-up Internet access applications, using a second (encapsulating) data link framing protocol such as PPP to create packets made up out of asynchronous serial characters. The most common physical layer interface used is RS-232D. The performance loss relative to synchronous access is negligible, as most modern modems will use a private synchronous protocol to send the data between themselves, and the asynchronous links at each end are operated faster than this data link, with flow control being used to throttle the data rate to prevent overrun.

<text>Cisterna di Latina is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Latina in Lazio, of central Italy. It was the scene of the Battle of Cisterna in January 1944.

The Garden of Ninfa is located in the commune&#x27;s territory.

The town, then known as &quot;Tres Tabernae&quot; (&quot;The Three Taverns&quot;) is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles as one of the towns where Saint Paul stopped on his way to Rome.

==History==
At Finocchione, in the territory of Cisterna, traces of prehistoric human presence have been discovered. In historic times, the Volsci founded here their still unidentified centre called &quot;Ulubrae&quot;, although the lost city of Suessa Pometia could also have been located nearby. &quot;Ulubrae&quot; is mentioned by Horace, Pliny the Elder, Suetonius, Cicero and Juvenal, referring to the numerous patrician villas built here. According to Suetonius, Augustus lived here in his family villa until the age of eighteen.

A village, called &quot;Tres Tabernae&quot;, originated starting from 312 BC as a post station on the Via Appia, its name stemming from the presence of three taverns. The site is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles as the place where St. Paul stopped during his journey to Rome, and was housed by the local Christian community. Around the 3rd century AD, the area was invaded by marshes, and the inhabitants of &quot;Ulubrae&quot; likely moved to &quot;Tres Tabernae&quot;, which grew in importance and became a Christian bishopric site with a Palaeo-Christian cathedral dedicated to St. Paul. In 307, emperor Flavius Severus was assassinated here by Heraclius, by order of rival usurper Maxentius. The barbarian invasions in Italy caused further expansions of the marshes, and Tres Tabernae declined until, in 592, pope Gregory I united its diocese to that of Velletri. Later in the high Middle Ages, Tres Tabernae was ravaged several times by the Saracens, until it was completely destroyed in 868.

The inhabitants moved to a small hill nearby, which is mentioned for the first time around 1000 AD as &quot;Terra di Cisterna&quot;, which, according to tradition, stemmed from &quot;Cisterna Neronis&quot; (&quot;Nero&#x27;s Cistern). An ancient cistern still exits today under the Palazzo Caetani at the top of the hill. Cisterna housed a Benedictine abbey dedicated to St. Eleutherius (later abandoned) and was a fief of the Counts of Tusculum, who ceded it to the Frangipani in 1146. The latter reinforced it with a line of walls and a &quot;rocca&quot; (castle). In 1159 Pope Alexander III fled here to escape emperor Frederick Barbarossa who, in retaliation, destroyed the borough, which was later rebuilt by the Frangipani. In 1328 it was again besieged and ravaged by emperor Louis IV.

In 1504 Pope Julius II assigned Cisterna to the Caetani. Their member Bonifacio Caetani renewed the city and, after demolishing it, rebuilt the castle as a patrician palace which still exists.

In the early 19th century, a land reclamation project for the area was launched by Pope Pius VI, but this was halted by the arrival of French troops in the course of the French Revolutionary Wars. Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen stopped here in 1840. The town, after a plebiscite, changed its name into Cisterna di Roma. A new reclamation project started under the Fascist Government in 1929, at a time in which swamps and marshes occupied much of the communal territory; this led to the creation of the nearby major center of Littoria (modern Latina); the town was re-christened Cisterna di Littoria as part of the newly created province of Latina.

During World War II, Cisterna was the site of a battle between the Germans and the Allies in 1944. 96% of the city&#x27;s buildings was destroyed until the area was conquered by the Allies on March 25, 1944. The city was later rebuilt, in particular in the 1970s, after numerous industries were founded in the area with the support of the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno: Cisterna&#x27;s inhabitants grew from some 7,000 in the 1940s to c. 30,000 in the 1980s. In the 1970s it became a major production center of kiwifruits. After the abolition of the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno, the industrial sector gradually lost importance and unemployement increased substantially in the territory.

==Main sights==
*Gardens of Ninfa
*Palazzo Caetani, built in 1560-1574 by cardinal Bonifazio Caetani under design of Francesco da Volterra, above the remains of the Frangipani castle. Damaged during World War II by allied bombings, it houses frescoes by Girolamo Siciolante da Sermoneta, Federico Zuccari and Taddeo Zuccari. A museum in the interior is dedicated to the horse and its shepherding in the area, with works by Aligi Sassu and others. The grottoes beneath it, traditionally the cisterns whence the city&#x27;s name came though more likely ancient quarries of tuff and pozzolan later used as catacombs, are still partially unexplored.
*Church of Santa Maria Assunta in Cielo
*Convent of Convento di Sant&#x27;Antonio Abate, now abandoned. It also houses frescoes by Girolamo and by the Zuccari brothers. The cloister has frescoes with episodes of St. Francis&#x27; life.
*Archaeological area of Tres Tabernae (closed) 
*Volscian archaeological area of Caprifico di Torrecchia, including a temple of Minerva
*Natural monument of Tenuta di Torrecchia Vecchia, a private garden and residential area designed by Gae Aulenti and others

<doc id="201000" wikidata="Q1359415" url="?curid=201000" title="Northumberland Strait">
<text>The Northumberland Strait (French: &quot;détroit de Northumberland&quot;) is a strait in the southern part of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in eastern Canada. The strait is formed by Prince Edward Island and the gulf&#x27;s eastern, southern, and western shores.

==Boundaries==
The western boundary of the strait is delineated by a line running between North Cape, Prince Edward Island and Point Escuminac, New Brunswick while the eastern boundary is delineated by a line running between East Point, Prince Edward Island and Inverness, Nova Scotia.
==Hydrography==
The Northumberland Strait varies in depth between 17 and 65 metres, with the deepest waters at either end. The tidal patterns are complex; the eastern end has the usual two tides per day, with a tidal range of 1.2 to 1.8 metres, while the western end effectively has only one tide per day.

The strait&#x27;s shallow depths lend to warm water temperatures in summer months, with some areas reaching 25°C, or 77°F. Consequently, the strait is reportedly home to the warmest ocean water temperatures in Canada, and some of the warmest ocean water temperatures on the Atlantic coast north of Virginia.

There are many sandy beaches along both the northern and southern coasts of the strait. These beaches, found in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia, are very popular with tourists.

During the winter months between December and April, sea ice covers the entire strait and Gulf of St. Lawrence.

==Geomorphology==
While the western shores of Cape Breton Island and northeastern shores of the Nova Scotia peninsula are dominated by granite, sedimentary rocks along the central and western parts of the strait, as well as the entire south shore of Prince Edward Island, consist of sandstone, lending to beautiful sandy beaches with minimal coastal development. The largest island in the strait is Pictou Island.

==Settlements==
Major communities on the strait include the cities of Charlottetown and Summerside, Prince Edward Island as well as the towns of Souris, Prince Edward Island, Pictou, Nova Scotia, and Shediac, New Brunswick.

==Transportation==
===Shipping===
The Northumberland Strait is a minor shipping route, with ports such as Pugwash shipping salt, Summerside, Charlottetown, Georgetown and Souris shipping agricultural products and receiving petroleum and aggregate, and Pictou shipping forestry products and general cargo. Shipping has declined in recent decades with the decline of rail service to ports and the increased capacity of highways to larger ports outside the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which freezes in the winter.

Cruise ships regularly visit Charlottetown during summer and fall, and since 2012 a few smaller cruise ships have been visiting Pictou, NS.

===Confederation Bridge===
The narrowest part of the strait, the 13-kilometre (7–nautical mile) wide Abegweit Passage in the western part of the strait between Borden-Carleton, Prince Edward Island and Cape Jourimain, New Brunswick, is now spanned by the Confederation Bridge.

===Ferries===
The strait hosts three seasonal ferry services:

* Northumberland Ferries Limited operates a passenger/vehicle service between Caribou, Nova Scotia and Wood Islands, Prince Edward Island.
* A passenger-only ferry service operates from Caribou, Nova Scotia to Pictou Island.
* Groupe CTMA operates a passenger/vehicle service between Souris, Prince Edward Island and Cap-aux-Meules, Quebec.

All three ferry services are located in the eastern end of the strait and operate during the ice-free months from May - December.

There was a year-round ferry service that operated in the central/western part of the strait across Abegweit Passage between Port Borden, Prince Edward Island and Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick. This service operated from October 1917 until May 1997. Owned by the Government of Canada, it was one of Canada&#x27;s busiest ferry services and was operated by various federal Crown corporations (Canadian National Railways, CN Marine, Marine Atlantic). The ferry service was replaced by the Confederation Bridge when it opened on 31 May 1997.

===Undersea cables===

;Electrical

Maritime Electric supplies electricity to customers in Prince Edward Island. Although the utility does have some electrical generation facilities, since the mid-1970s the majority of Prince Edward Island&#x27;s electricity has been purchased from NB Power and supplied via an interprovincial electrical interconnection. This interconnection consisted of two 138 kilovolt oil-filled submarine transmission cables installed 1975-78 under the Northumberland Strait at the western end of the Abegweit Passage between Murray Corner, New Brunswick and Fernwood, Prince Edward Island. Since the Northumberland Strait freezes in winter, the cables were designed to be protected from ice scouring and were copied from a Swedish design that was originally used to supply the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. They were replaced in 2017 by two new cables providing a capacity of 300 MW.

Pictou Island, in Nova Scotia receives no electricity from that province&#x27;s utility, Nova Scotia Power. Residents must generate their own electricity from off-grid sources.

;Telecommunications
Bell Aliant has two fibre optic telecommunications cables spanning Northumberland Strait to serve Prince Edward Island. The first is a submarine cable running from Caribou, Nova Scotia to Wood Islands, Prince Edward Island. The other runs through the Confederation Bridge; this cable replaced a submarine cable that used to run from Borden-Carleton, Prince Edward Island to Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick.

Eastlink has a fibre optic telecommunications cable connecting Gaspereau, Prince Edward Island with Port Hood, Nova Scotia.

===Swim crossings===
Swim-related details about crossings, tides, currents, marine life, and navigation can be found at OpenWaterPedia&#x27;s Northumberland Strait page.

There have been several documented unassisted swim crossings of the strait, although there is no official body to verify these claims. All documented single and double crossings except one have been at the western end of the strait across the Abegweit Passage.

The first documented single crossing of Abegweit Passage (approximately ) with assistance was made by Evelyn Henry of Keppoch, PEI on July 15, 1951, when she swam from Cape Tormentine, NB to Borden, PEI in 8 hours, 47 minutes.

There have been two documented single-day double crossings of Abegweit Passage (approximately ) with assistance to date:
* Jennifer Alexander of Halifax, NS, swam a double-crossing on July 26, 2007, in 19 hours, 17 minutes from Cape Jourimain, NB to Borden, PEI.
* Kristin Roe of Halifax, NS, swam a double-crossing on July 26, 2008, in 15 hours, 40 minutes from Cape Jourimain, NB to Borden, PEI.

The first and to date only, documented single crossing with assistance across the eastern end of the strait (approximately was made by Jill Leon of Charlottetown, PEI on July 31, 2013, when she swam from Caribou, NS to Wood Islands, PEI in 9 hours, 48 minutes.

==Cultural significance==
The strait is famous in folklore circles for regular sightings of the Ghost Ship of Northumberland Strait, a flaming vessel which appears in the middle of the strait. The strait is also notable for the ice boats, small oared boats which made regular dangerous crossings of the strait in winter carrying mail and passengers before the era of ice breaking ferries.

<doc id="201002" wikidata="Q840970" url="?curid=201002" title="Magnetostriction">
<text>Magnetostriction is a property of magnetic materials that causes them to change their shape or dimensions during the process of magnetization. The variation of materials&#x27; magnetization due to the applied magnetic field changes the magnetostrictive strain until reaching its saturation value, λ. The effect was first identified in 1842 by James Joule when observing a sample of iron.

Magnetostriction applies to magnetic fields, while electrostriction applies to electric fields.

Magnetostriction causes energy loss due to frictional heating in susceptible ferromagnetic cores, and is also responsible for the low-pitched humming sound that can be heard coming from transformers, where alternating currents produce a changing magnetic field.

== Explanation ==
Internally, ferromagnetic materials have a structure that is divided into &quot;domains&quot;, each of which is a region of uniform magnetization. When a magnetic field is applied, the boundaries between the domains shift and the domains rotate; both of these effects cause a change in the material&#x27;s dimensions. The reason that a change in the magnetic domains of a material results in a change in the material&#x27;s dimensions is a consequence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy; it takes more energy to magnetize a crystalline material in one direction than in another. If a magnetic field is applied to the material at an angle to an easy axis of magnetization, the material will tend to rearrange its structure so that an easy axis is aligned with the field to minimize the free energy of the system. Since different crystal directions are associated with different lengths, this effect induces a strain in the material.

The reciprocal effect, the change of the magnetic susceptibility (response to an applied field) of a material when subjected to a mechanical stress, is called the Villari effect. Two other effects are related to magnetostriction: the Matteucci effect is the creation of a helical anisotropy of the susceptibility of a magnetostrictive material when subjected to a torque and the Wiedemann effect is the twisting of these materials when a helical magnetic field is applied to them.

The Villari reversal is the change in sign of the magnetostriction of iron from positive to negative when exposed to magnetic fields of approximately 40 kA/m.

On magnetization, a magnetic material undergoes changes in volume which are small: of the order 10−6.

== Magnetostrictive hysteresis loop ==

Like flux density, the magnetostriction also exhibits hysteresis versus the strength of the magnetizing field. The shape of this hysteresis loop (called &quot;dragonfly loop&quot;) can be reproduced using the Jiles-Atherton model.

== Magnetostrictive materials ==
Magnetostrictive materials can convert magnetic energy into kinetic energy, or the reverse, and are used to build actuators and sensors. The property can be quantified by the magnetostrictive coefficient, λ, which may be positive or negative and is defined as the fractional change in length as the magnetization of the material increases from zero to the saturation value. The effect is responsible for the familiar &quot;electric hum&quot; () which can be heard near transformers and high power electrical devices.

Cobalt exhibits the largest room-temperature magnetostriction of a pure element at 60 s. Among alloys, the highest known magnetostriction is exhibited by Terfenol-D, (Ter for terbium, Fe for iron, NOL for Naval Ordnance Laboratory, and D for dysprosium). Terfenol-D, , exhibits about 2,000 microstrains in a field of 160 kA/m (2 kOe) at room temperature and is the most commonly used engineering magnetostrictive material. Galfenol, , and Alfer, , are newer alloys that exhibit 200-400 microstrains at lower applied fields (~200 Oe) and have enhanced mechanical properties from the brittle Terfenol-D. Both of these alloys have &lt;100&gt; easy axes for magnetostriction and demonstrate sufficient ductility for sensor and actuator applications.

Another very common magnetostrictive composite is the amorphous alloy with its trade name Metglas 2605SC. Favourable properties of this material are its high saturation-magnetostriction constant, λ, of about 20 s and more, coupled with a low magnetic-anisotropy field strength, HA, of less than 1 kA/m (to reach magnetic saturation). Metglas 2605SC also exhibits a very strong ΔE-effect with reductions in the effective Young&#x27;s modulus up to about 80% in bulk. This helps build energy-efficient magnetic MEMS.

Cobalt ferrite, (CoO·Fe2O3), is also mainly used for its magnetostrictive applications like sensors and actuators, thanks to its high saturation magnetostriction (~200 parts per million). In the absence of rare-earth elements, it is a good substitute for Terfenol-D. Moreover, its magnetostrictive properties can be tuned by inducing a magnetic uniaxial anisotropy. This can be done by magnetic annealing, magnetic field assisted compaction, or reaction under uniaxial pressure. This last solution has the advantage of being ultrafast (20 min), thanks to the use of spark plasma sintering.

In early sonar transducers during World War II, nickel was used as a magnetostrictive material. To alleviate the shortage of nickel, the Japanese navy used an iron-aluminium alloy from the Alperm family.

===Mechanical behaviors of magnetostrictive alloys===

====Effect of microstructure on elastic strain alloys==== 
Single-crystal alloys exhibit superior microstrain, but are vulnerable to yielding due to the anisotropic mechanical properties of most metals. It has been observed that for polycrystalline alloys with a high area coverage of preferential grains for microstrain, the mechanical properties (ductility) of magnetostrictive alloys can be significantly improved. Targeted metallurgical processing steps promote abnormal grain growth of {011} grains in galfenol and alfenol thin sheets, which contain two easy axes for magnetic domain alignment during magnetostriction. This can be accomplished by adding particles such as boride species and niobium carbide () during initial chill casting of the ingot.

For a polycrystalline alloy, an established formula for the magnetostriction, λ, from known directional microstrain measurements is:

λs = 1/5(2λ100+3λ111)

During subsequent hot rolling and recrystallization steps, particle strengthening occurs in which the particles introduce a “pinning” force at grain boundaries that hinders normal (stochastic) grain growth in an annealing step assisted by a atmosphere. Thus, single-crystal-like texture (~90% {011} grain coverage) is attainable, reducing the interference with magnetic domain alignment and increasing microstrain attainable for polycrystalline alloys as measured by semiconducting strain gauges. These surface textures can be visualized using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) or related diffraction techniques.

====Compressive stress to induce domain alignment====
For actuator applications, maximum rotation of magnetic moments leads to the highest possible magnetostriction output. This can be achieved by processing techniques such as stress annealing and field annealing. However, mechanical pre-stresses can also be applied to thin sheets to induce alignment perpendicular to actuation as long as the stress is below the buckling limit. For example, it has been demonstrated that applied compressive pre-stress of up to ~50 MPa can result in an increase of magnetostriction by ~90%. This is hypothesized to be due to a &quot;jump&quot; in initial alignment of domains perpendicular to applied stress and improved final alignment parallel to applied stress.

===Constitutive behavior of magnetostrictive materials===
These materials generally show non-linear behavior with a change in applied magnetic field or stress. For small magnetic fields, linear piezomagnetic constitutive behavior is enough. Non-linear magnetic behavior is captured using a classical macroscopic model such as the Preisach model and Jiles-Atherton model. For capturing magneto-mechanical behavior, Armstrong proposed an &quot;energy average&quot; approach. More recently, Wahi &quot;et al.&quot; have proposed a computationally efficient constitutive model wherein constitutive behavior is captured using a &quot;locally linearizing&quot; scheme.

<doc id="201008" wikidata="Q865076" url="?curid=201008" title="Confederation Bridge">
<text>The Confederation Bridge () is a box girder bridge carrying the Trans-Canada Highway across the Abegweit Passage of the Northumberland Strait, linking the province of Prince Edward Island with the mainland province of New Brunswick. Opened on May 31, 1997, the bridge is Canada&#x27;s longest bridge and the world&#x27;s longest bridge over ice-covered water.

Construction took place from 1 November 1993 until May 1997 and cost C$1.3 billion. Before its official naming, Prince Edward Islanders often referred to the bridge as the &quot;Fixed Link&quot;. It officially opened to traffic on May 31, 1997.

==Structure==
The bridge is a two-lane toll bridge that carries the Trans-Canada Highway between Borden-Carleton, Prince Edward Island (at Route 1) and Cape Jourimain, New Brunswick (at Route 16).

It is a multi-span balanced cantilever bridge with a post-tensioned concrete box girder structure. Most of the curved bridge is above water with a navigation span for ship traffic. The bridge rests on 62 piers, of which the 44 main piers are apart. The bridge is wide.

The speed limit on the bridge is but can vary with wind and weather conditions. When travelling at the speed limit, it takes about 12 minutes to cross the bridge.

==Tolls==
Tolls apply only when leaving Prince Edward Island (when travelling westbound). The toll rates are $50.25 for a two-axle automobile and $8.50 for each additional axle. Motorcycles are charged $20.00. 
While pedestrians and cyclists are not permitted to cross the bridge, a shuttle service is available. Before 2006, the shuttle was free and since January 1, 2022, the service has charged $4.75 per pedestrian or $9.50 per cyclist when leaving Prince Edward Island. Baggage is charged at a rate of $4.25 per bag after the first bag.

The other major Northumberland Strait crossing, Wood Islands Ferry from Wood Islands, Prince Edward Island to Caribou, Nova Scotia, charges when leaving Prince Edward Island. Other ferry fares include $20.00 per adult pedestrian, $40.00 per motorcycle, and $20.00 per bicycle. Travellers, whether entering the island by bridge and leaving by ferry or &quot;vice versa&quot; pay for leaving the island only.

==History==
Various proposals for a fixed link across the Northumberland Strait can be traced as far back as the 1870s when the provinces&#x27; railway systems were developed. Subsequent proposals arose during federal elections in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The ebb and flow of public support for a fixed link was indirectly tied to the varying levels of federal investment in ferry and steamship connections to the province over the years, finally culminating in a proposal in the mid-1980s which resulted in the construction of the current bridge.

===Water transportation links===
As a part of Prince Edward Island&#x27;s admission into the Dominion of Canada in 1873, the Canadian government was obligated to provide:

Following Confederation, early steamship services across Northumberland Strait connected the Island ports of Charlottetown and Georgetown with railway facilities at Pictou, Nova Scotia. Similar services operated from Summerside connected with railway facilities at Shediac, New Brunswick.

The most direct route across the Northumberland Strait, however, was at the wide Abegweit Passage. Infrequent winter service provided by underpowered steamships incapable of breaking sea ice ensured the survival of a passenger and mail service across Abegweit Passage using iceboats until a permanent ferry service was established in the 1910s.

The unsatisfactory winter steamship service and reliance upon primitive iceboats provoked complaints from the Island government until the federal government decided to implement a railcar ferry service across Abegweit Passage between new ports at Port Borden and Cape Tormentine.

In 1912, the federal government promised to open a car ferry between the &quot;Capes&quot; (Cape Traverse, PEI to Cape Tormentine, NB). The privately owned New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island Railway from Sackville, New Brunswick to Cape Tormentine was purchased by the federal government and an order was made with a shipyard in England for an icebreaking railcar ferry, to be called the &quot;Prince Edward Island&quot;. Ports were developed at Carleton Point, several kilometres west of Cape Traverse, and the existing harbour at Cape Tormentine; the new port at Carleton Point would be named Borden in honour of Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden.

The new ferry entered service in 1915 and operated on the former steamship routes until port facilities were opened in October 1917. Automobile service was added in 1938 and other vessels followed as the ferry service expanded in the post-war years.

This ferry service was initially the responsibility of Canadian Government Railways (1917–1918) and later Canadian National Railway (1918–1983), then a CNR subsidiary CN Marine (1977–1986). In 1986, CN Marine was renamed when all federal government ferry services in Atlantic Canada were transferred to the new Crown corporation Marine Atlantic.

===Early proposals===

Discussion of a fixed link can be traced to George Howlan, who called for construction of a railway tunnel beneath Abegweit Passage at the same time as the Prince Edward Island Railway was being built across the province in the 1870s. Howlan also raised the issue as a member of the provincial Legislative Assembly, and in 1891, as a Senator and member of a delegation to meetings on the subject, conducted at the British Parliament. The idea lost favour following his death in 1901.

Talk of a fixed link was revived in the 1950s and 1960s, coinciding with federal election campaigns. The topic was raised in 1957, only two years following the opening of the Canso Causeway, and at the same time as another mega-project, the St. Lawrence Seaway was being constructed. A rockfill causeway was proposed to cross Abegweit Passage, with a bridge/tunnel to accommodate shipping. This plan was rejected for navigational reasons but was raised again in 1962, and in 1965, the federal government, ignoring concerns of the shipping industry, called for tenders for a $148 million fixed link featuring a tunnel/causeway/bridge. Approach roads and railway lines were constructed at Borden and Jourimain Island but the project was formally abandoned in 1969 upon scientific recommendation in favour of improved ferry services.

Due to the extremely complex tidal regime in the Northumberland Strait consisting of diurnal and semi-diurnal cycles, any attempt to close Abegweit Passage would be next to impossible since the tidal cycles on each side of a causeway would be placed at opposites to each other. It is estimated by tidal experts at the Canadian Hydrographic Service, that tidal currents through a gap in such a causeway would be in excess of , powerful enough to counter most commercial ships and to sweep away boulders the size of houses.

===1988 plebiscite===
Consideration of a fixed link was renewed in the 1980s by an unsolicited proposal from a Nova Scotia businessman. The federal government favoured the construction of a fixed link chiefly because of the rising costs of providing ferry service (a constitutional requirement dating from PEI&#x27;s accession to Confederation) and the increasing deficits being incurred by the railway system on PEI (run as part of Canadian National, then a Crown corporation). The federal government proposed to provide a fixed subsidy for the construction and operation of a fixed link, in return for the province agreeing to the abandonment of the ferry service and the railway system.

Following the election of the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney, with its agenda for regional development through so-called &quot;mega-projects,&quot; Public Works Canada called for formal proposals in 1987 and received three offers. These proposals included a tunnel, a bridge, and a combined tunnel-causeway-bridge.

These developments sparked an extremely divisive debate on the Island, and Premier Joe Ghiz promised a plebiscite to gauge public support, which was held on January 18, 1988.

During the plebiscite debate, the anti-link group &quot;Friends of the Island&quot; cited potential ecological damage from the construction, as well as concerns about the impact on Prince Edward Island&#x27;s lifestyle in general, and noted that the &quot;mega-project&quot; model has had limited success in other areas of the world, and rarely enriched the local population. The &quot;Friends of the Island&quot; believed that a fixed link was being pressured by a federal government not willing to shoulder the cost of constitutional obligations for funding an efficient ferry service, and that a link would be built largely for the benefit of mainland tourists and businesses waiting to exploit the Island.

The pro-link group &quot;Islanders for a Better Tomorrow&quot; noted transportation reliability would result in improvements for exporters and the tourism industry.

The result was 59.4% (in total percentage) in favour of the fixed link.

==Bridge development==
The debate did not end with the 1988 plebiscite and the federal government faced numerous legal challenges and a lengthy environmental impact assessment for the project. The developer of the single bridge proposal, Strait Crossing Development Inc., was selected and an announcement that the Northumberland Strait Crossing Project would be built was finally made on December 2, 1992; the developer being required to privately finance all construction through bond markets.

Shareholders of Strait Crossing Development Inc. include:
* OMERS, an Ontario public servant pension fund (under the OMERS subsidiary BPC Maritime Corporation)
* VINCI Concessions Canada Inc., Montreal, Quebec
* Strait Crossing Inc., Calgary, Alberta (at one time part of the W. A. Stephenson / Stephenson Construction International (SCI) Engineers &amp; Constructors Group of Companies)

===Constitutional amendment===
As mentioned, the in the Constitution of Canada required steamship service to connect the Island&#x27;s railway system with that of mainland North America. A dedicated ferry service replaced the steamships in 1917, but no changes were made to the constitution. The fixed crossing, however, required a constitutional amendment (see Amendments to the Constitution of Canada).

The (Prince Edward Island) dealt with this issue, as well as the issue of tolls on the crossing. It made clear that the government (or a private body) could charge a toll (an essential part of the government&#x27;s financing plans) for the crossing without violating the terms of union:

:&quot;That a fixed crossing joining the Island to the mainland may be substituted for the steam service referred to in this Schedule... That, for greater certainty, nothing in this Schedule prevents the imposition of tolls for the use of such a fixed crossing between the Island and the mainland, or the private operation of such a crossing;&quot;

===Construction===

The construction, which was carried out by a construction joint venture of Ballast Nedam, GTMI (Canada), Northern Construction and Strait Crossing Inc., started in the fall of 1993, beginning with preparation of staging facilities. Bridge components were built year-round from 1994 to the summer of 1996, and placement of components began in the fall of 1994 until the fall of 1996. Approach roads, toll plazas, and final work on the structure continued until the spring of 1997, at an estimated total cost of $1 billion.

All bridge components were constructed on land, in purpose-built staging yards located on the shoreline at Amherst Head, fronting on Borden Harbour just east of the town and ferry docks, and an inland facility located at Bayfield, New Brunswick, about west of Cape Tormentine. The Amherst Head staging facility was where all large components were built, including the pier bases, ice shields, main spans, and drop-in spans. The Bayfield facility was used to construct components for the near-shore bridges which were linked using a launching truss extending over shallow waters almost from the New Brunswick shore, and from the Prince Edward Island shore.
Extremely durable high-grade concrete and reinforcing steel were used throughout construction of the pre-cast components, with the estimated lifespan of the bridge being in excess of 100 years. The reinforced concrete structure was also designed to withstand iceberg impacts, as a deflection cone encircles each pillar at the point when it meets the water surface that would cause an iceberg to bounce off. Their sheer size and weight required strengthening of the soil base during the design and preparation work for the Amherst Head staging facility, as well as the use of a crawler transport system to move pieces from fabrication to storage, and onto a nearby pier. These crawler transports, using specially designed teflon-coated concrete rails, earned the nickname &quot;lobsters&quot; from workers.

All major components were lifted from the Amherst Head staging facility, transported, and placed in Abegweit Passage using the HLV &quot;Svanen&quot;, a Dutch-built heavy lift catamaran, which during the construction of the fixed link was reportedly the tallest man-made structure in the province. HLV &quot;Svanen&quot; was custom-built for use on the Great Belt Bridge in the early 1990s, Denmark&#x27;s largest construction project, and was modified at a French shipyard before working on the Northumberland Strait Crossing Project. Following the placement of the final major component and completion of the bridge structure in Abegweit Passage on November 19, 1996, HLV &quot;Svanen&quot; returned to Denmark for use in construction of the Øresund Bridge.

Construction of the fixed link required over 5,000 workers ranging from labourers and specialty trades, to engineers, surveyors, and managers. The economic impact of construction on Prince Edward Island was substantial, with the provincial GDP rising over 5% during the construction, providing a short-term economic boom for the Island.

It neared completion in April 1997.

===Naming===
Throughout construction, the federal government received suggestions for names. A committee was formed on May 1, 1996, chaired by former PEI Premier Alex Campbell, to choose the new name from the submissions. The committee chose the name &quot;Abegweit Crossing&quot;, which would pay homage to the Abegweit Passage which the bridge crosses, the vessel M/V &quot;Abegweit&quot; which the bridge would replace, and to the Mi&#x27;kmaq traditional name for the island.

However, the Canadian government overruled the committee, and on September 27, 1996, the Minister of Public Works and Government Services Diane Marleau announced that the bridge&#x27;s name would be &quot;Confederation Bridge&quot;. This name is not without controversy as many Islanders feel the word &quot;Confederation&quot; is overused throughout the province, finding use in the name of a Northumberland Ferries Limited vessel (M/V &quot;Confederation&quot;), a performing arts centre and art gallery (Confederation Centre of the Arts), a shopping centre (Confederation Court Mall), and the province-wide rails to trails system (Confederation Trail), as well as in tourism promotions (e.g., &quot;Birthplace of Confederation&quot;).

The President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, during a state visit to Canada in 1998, referred to the bridge as the &quot;Span of Green Gables&quot;.

In April 2022, the PEI legislature voted unanimously in favour of renaming the bridge to &quot;Epekwitk Crossing&quot;, whereas Epekwitk ( ) is the traditional Mi&#x27;kmaq name for Prince Edward Island. The name change would need to be approved by the Canadian federal government in order to take effect.

=== Finishing ===
After completing the structure on November 19, 1996, SCI worked throughout the winter, paving the bridge deck, placing bridge concrete barrier guardrails which also act as wind barriers, placing bridge deck and navigational lighting, constructing the Borden-Carleton toll plaza, and finishing the New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island approach roads. In separate construction, the federal and provincial governments built a new commercial and tourist development on the abandoned CN rail yards in Borden-Carleton, with phase I of this facility opening in spring 1997 as &quot;Gateway Village&quot;. New Brunswick has never received similar federal support to improve the economy of Cape Tormentine, which has become a shadow of its former role in PEI transportation history, although in recent years a new eco-tourist and visitor centre was opened on Jourimain Island near the western end of the bridge.

===Official opening===
The official opening for the bridge took place on May 31, 1997, with the first vehicle traffic crossing at approximately 5:00 p.m. ADT following a nationally televised ceremony which aired on CBC and included a sailpast of the schooner &quot;Bluenose II&quot; and several Canadian Coast Guard ships, a flyover by the &quot;Snowbirds&quot;, and an emotional farewell to the beloved ferries which made their final crossings that evening. It is estimated that almost 75,000 people participated in a &quot;Bridge Walk&quot; and &quot;Bridge Run&quot; during the hours immediately prior to the opening for traffic.

BridgeFest &#x27;97 began on Friday, May 30th, starting with the run in the morning, and then the walk continuing for the rest of the day. Thousands of people walked across the bridge on Friday.

In the days following the opening of the bridge, ferry operator Marine Atlantic disposed of its four vessels. The ferry terminals and docks in both ports were removed over the summer of 1997.

===Operation===
The bridge is operated by Strait Crossing Bridge Limited (SCBL), a subsidiary of the Strait Crossing Development Inc. consortium which built the structure. SCBL will privately manage, maintain, and operate the bridge until 2032, when these operations will transfer to the Government of Canada.

The Government of Canada agreed to pay about $44 million a year for 33 years to Strait Crossing Development Inc., this being the subsidy which was formerly paid to Marine Atlantic to cover operating losses of the ferry system. These payments are in effect a mortgage and are being used by the developer to pay off construction costs. In 2032, the bridge&#x27;s ownership will revert to the federal government.

All tolls charged by SCBL are revenue for the consortium. Toll increases are indexed to inflation and regulated by the federal government. The consortium has rarely commented upon the profitability of the bridge, but during the structure&#x27;s 10th anniversary, it was revealed that there had been a 30% cost overrun in construction ($330 million). The consortium is forced to cover this out of toll revenue since the federal government ferry subsidy is used to pay for the original tendered price ($1 billion). Operating costs for the bridge have also proven expensive, with warranty repairs for asphalt adherence and the complete replacement of all bridge deck lighting cutting into profits. Toll revenues have fallen over 30% since the bridge opened, largely because of declining tourism traffic and domestic travel and currently range from $25 to $30 million annually. After expenses in 2003, the consortium received a year-end dividend of $2.6 million.

==Effect==

The number of tourists visiting Prince Edward Island increased from 740,000 in 1996 (the year before the bridge opened) to 1,200,000 in 1997, but this dropped back to about 900,000 visitors annually.

As a way of further promoting the island&#x27;s new accessibility, the province issued vehicle licence plates from 1999 to 2006 that featured a likeness of the Confederation Bridge amid the serial number. These plates, along with four other designs, started being replaced by a single design in 2013.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance was a Grammy Award presented to male recording artists for works (songs or albums) containing quality vocal performances in the rock music genre. Originally called the Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male, the award was first presented to Bob Dylan in 1980. Beginning with the 1995 ceremony, the name of the award was changed to Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. However, in 1988, 1992, 1994, and since 2005, this category was combined with the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and presented in a genderless category known as Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo. The solo category was later renamed to Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance beginning in 2005. This fusion has been criticized, especially when females are not nominated under the solo category. The Academy has cited a lack of eligible recordings in the female rock category as the reason for the mergers. While the award has not been presented since the category merge in 2005, an official confirmation of its retirement has not been announced.

Lenny Kravitz holds the record for the most wins in this category, with a total of four consecutive wins from 1999 to 2002. Bruce Springsteen has been presented the award three times, and two-time winners include Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Don Henley, and Robert Palmer. Since its inception, American artists have been presented with the award more than any other nationality, though it has been presented to musicians from the United Kingdom four times, from Australia once, and from South Africa once.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance was an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for works (songs or albums) containing quality vocal performances in the rock music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Originally called the Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo, the award was first presented to Bruce Springsteen in 1988 for the album &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;. Since then, the award was presented in 1992 and 1994, and has been awarded each year since 2005. Beginning with the 2005 ceremony, the name of the award was changed to Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. For these years, the award combined and replaced the gender-specific awards for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. This fusion has been criticized, especially when females are not nominated under the solo category. The Academy has cited a lack of eligible recordings in the female rock category as the reason for the mergers.

The award was discontinued in 2012 in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. All solo or duo/group performances in the rock category are now honored in the Best Rock Performance category. Springsteen holds the record for the most wins in this category, with five (he has also received three awards for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance). No other performing artists had received the award more than once. Neil Young holds the record for the most nominations without a win, with four.

<text>Lord British, or Lord Cantabrigian British, is the fictional ruler of Britannia, a kingdom in the fictional world of Sosaria, created by Richard Garriott for his video game series &quot;Ultima&quot;.

==Concept and creation==

&quot;Ultima&quot; series creator Richard Garriott acquired the nickname &quot;British&quot; as a teenager from friends at computer camp who claimed his greeting to them, &quot;Hello&quot;, was distinct from the usual American &quot;Hi&quot;. The Lord title was later added when he played as dungeon master in his &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; games. When his first published game &quot;Akalabeth&quot; was released, the president of the publishing company suggested he use the name in the game, since it was more memorable than his real name. Garriott released &quot;&quot; and all other Ultima games under the pseudonym, and occasionally appeared in &quot;Ultima Online&quot; playing as Lord British and meting out justice to his players. He is still known as Lord British. Garriott retained the trademark rights to the name Lord British with its associated symbols, and the character appears in his game &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot; as General British.

==Appearances==
Lord British appears in various entries in the &quot;Ultima&quot; series. Neither the Avatar nor Lord British are born in Sosaria, but come from Earth via the moongates. Numerous plotlines and side quests in the &quot;Ultima&quot; games revolve around Lord British&#x27;s adventures or public works projects. In the games, he has a key role in founding the Museum, Conservatory, and other institutions of the Britannian society. He rarely leaves his castle.
===Assassination===

One of the most famous attributes of Lord British is that he is almost invincible. In every Ultima game in which he has appeared, he is designed to be &quot;almost&quot; impervious to a player&#x27;s character predations. However, there are ways for a player thinking outside the box to assassinate him.

This phenomenon is the origin of the &quot;Lord British Postulate&quot; which states: &quot;If it exists as a living creature in an MMORPG, someone, somewhere, will try to kill it.&quot;

Lord British was first killed during an in-game appearance on &quot;Ultima Online&quot;&#x27;s beta test on August 9, 1997. A royal visit was conducted as a part of server population stress test. A player character known as Rainz cast a spell called &quot;fire field&quot; on Lord British that killed him. According to Starr Long, it was just a human error: Lord British&#x27;s character, like others, had been made invulnerable, but by design the invulnerability did not persist over several game sessions. Shortly before the incident, the server crashed, and Richard Garriott forgot to turn his invulnerability flag on when logging on again. Shortly afterwards, Rainz&#x27;s account was banned from the beta test, though according to Origin, he was not banned for the assassination but for previous complaints against his account. After Lord British was killed, fellow &quot;Ultima Online&quot; developer Starr Long (also known in-game as Lord Blackthorn) summoned some demons, who attacked innocent bystanders. This led to beta testers protesting both the indiscriminate killing and the banning of the assassin.

He has since been included in other &quot;Ultima&quot; games, where he is often assassinated despite the developers&#x27; best efforts, though some deaths are included as Easter eggs. According to interviewer Shay Addams, &quot;Garriott was less than pleased&quot; that some players had found a way to kill Lord British in &quot;Ultima III: Exodus&quot;, having taken steps to avoid it. In &quot;Ultima VII&quot;, an Easter egg allows British to be killed. If the player double-clicks the gold plaque above the castle gate when British is standing directly underneath (which he invariably does at exactly noon each day), the plaque will fall on his head. The player can arrange several chairs or crates around him in such a way as to trap him underneath the plaque. This was inspired by an incident at the Origin building: a metal bar, attached to the door by a magnet, fell on Garriott&#x27;s head, warranting a visit to the hospital. One of the characters says &quot;Yancey-Hausman will pay!&quot;, which is a reference to the owner and landlord of the building.

==Reception==

In a 2021 list published by &quot;PC Gamer&quot; staff, Lord British is ranked among the most iconic characters in PC gaming. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; staff called it an iconic moment in MMOs, and &quot;Wired magazine&quot; writer Anne-Marie Ostler felt it was an &quot;event reverberated through the gaming world.&quot; Professor Megan Winget of the University of Texas, coordinator of a project to study the best way to preserve video game history, stated in a BBC interview that the death of Lord British in the &quot;Ultima&quot; games is something people remember and are affected by.

<text>The budgerigar ( ; Melopsittacus undulatus), also known as the common [[parakeet]], shell parakeet or budgie ( ), is a small, long-tailed, seed-eating parrot native to Australia. Naturally the species is green and yellow with black, scalloped markings on the nape, back, and wings. Budgies are bred in captivity with colouring of blues, whites, yellows, greys, and even with small crests. Juveniles and chicks are monomorphic (the sexes are visually indistinguishable), while adults are told apart by their cere colouring and their behaviour.

The species is monotypic, meaning it is the only member of the genus Melopsittacus, which is the only genus in the Melopsittacini tribe. 
The budgerigar is closely related to lories and the fig parrots.

The origin of the budgerigar&#x27;s name is unclear. First recorded in 1805, budgerigars are popular pets around the world due to their small size, low cost, and ability to mimic human speech. They are likely the third most popular pet in the world, after the domesticated dog and cat. Budgies are nomadic flock parakeets that have been bred in captivity since the 19th century. In both captivity and the wild, budgerigars breed opportunistically and in pairs.

They are found wild throughout the drier parts of Australia, where they have survived harsh inland conditions for over five million years. Their success can be attributed to a nomadic lifestyle and their ability to breed while on the move.

== Etymology ==
Several possible origins for the name &quot;budgerigar&quot; have been proposed.
One origin could be that &quot;budgerigar&quot; may be a mispronunciation or alteration of the Gamilaraay word &quot;gidjirrigaa&quot; () or &quot;gijirragaa&quot; from the Yuwaalaraay.
Another possible origin is that &quot;budgerigar&quot; might be a modified form of &quot;budgery&quot; or &quot;boojery&quot; (Australian English slang for &quot;good&quot;) and &quot;gar&quot; (&quot;cockatoo&quot;).
While many references mention &quot;good&quot; as part of the meaning, and a few specify &quot;good bird&quot;, it is quite possible that reports by those local to the region are more accurate in specifying the direct translation as &quot;good food&quot;.

Alternative spellings include &quot;budgerygah&quot; and &quot;betcherrygah&quot;, the latter used by Indigenous people of the Liverpool Plains in New South Wales.

Alternative names for the budgerigar include the &quot;shell parrot&quot; or &quot;shell parakeet&quot;, the &quot;warbling grass parakeet&quot;, the &quot;canary parrot&quot;, the &quot;zebra parrot&quot;, the &quot;flight bird&quot;, and the &quot;scallop parrot&quot;. Although more often used as a common name for small parrots in the genus &quot;Agapornis&quot;, the name &quot;lovebird&quot; has been used for budgerigars, because of their habit of close perching, mutual preening, and their long term pair-bonds.

== Taxonomy ==
The budgerigar was first described by George Shaw in 1805, and given its current binomial name by John Gould in 1840. The genus name &quot;Melopsittacus&quot;, from Ancient Greek, means &quot;melodious parrot&quot;. The species name &quot;undulatus&quot; is Latin for &quot;undulated&quot; or &quot;wave-patterned&quot;.

The budgerigar was once proposed to be a link between the genera &quot;Neophema&quot; and &quot;Pezoporus&quot;, based on the barred plumage. However, recent phylogenetic studies using DNA sequences place the budgerigar very close to the lories (tribe Loriini) and the fig parrots (tribe Cyclopsittini).

== Description ==
Wild budgerigars average long, weigh , in wingspan, and display a light green body colour, while their mantles display pitch-black mantle markings (blackish in fledglings and immatures) edged in clear yellow undulations. The forehead and face is yellow in adults.

Prior to their adult plumage, young individuals have blackish stripes down to the cere in young individuals until around 3–4 months of age. They display small, iridescent blue-violet cheek patches and a series of three black spots across each side of their throat. The two outermost throat spots are situated at the base of each cheek patch. The tail is cobalt, and outside tail feathers display central yellow flashes. Their wings have greenish-black flight feathers and black coverts with yellow fringes along with central yellow flashes, which only become visible in flight or when the wings are outstretched. Bills are olive grey and legs blueish-grey, with zygodactyl toes.

In their natural Australian habitat, budgerigars are noticeably smaller than those in captivity. This particular parrot species has been bred in many other colours and shades in captivity (e.g. blue, grey, grey-green, pieds, violet, white, yellow-blue). Pet store individuals will commonly be blue, green, or yellow. Like most parrot species, budgerigar plumage fluoresces under ultraviolet light – a phenomenon possibly related to courtship and mate selection.

The colour of the cere (the area containing the nostrils) differs between the sexes, being a lavender/baby blue in males, pale brownish/white (non breeding) to brown (breeding) in females, and pink in immature birds of both sexes (usually of a more even purplish-pink colour in young males). Some female budgerigars develop brown cere only during breeding time, which later returns to the normal colour. Young females can often be identified by a subtle, chalky whiteness that starts around the nostrils. Males that are either albino, lutino, dark-eyed clear or recessive pied (Danish pied or harlequin) retain the immature purplish-pink cere colour for their entire lives.
Mature males usually have a cere of light to dark blue, but in some particular colour mutations it can be periwinkle, lavender, purplish or pink – including dark-eyed clears, Danish pieds (recessive pieds) and inos, which usually display much rounder heads. Female budgerigars display more dominant behaviour compared to males of the species and may act aggressively towards them.

Budgerigars have tetrachromatic colour vision, although all four classes of cone cells will not operate simultaneously unless under sunlight or a UV lamp. The ultraviolet spectrum brightens their feathers to attract mates. The throat spots in budgerigars reflect UV and can be used to distinguish individual birds. While ultraviolet light is essential to the good health of caged and pet birds, inadequate darkness or rest results in overstimulation.

=== Colour mutations ===

All captive budgerigars are divided into two basic series of colours; namely, white-based (blue, grey and white) and yellow-based (green, grey-green and yellow). Presently, at least 32 primary mutations (including violet) occur, enabling hundreds of possible secondary mutations (stable combined primary mutations) and colour varieties (unstable combined mutations).

== Ecology ==

Budgerigars are nomadic and flocks move on from sites as environmental conditions change. Budgerigars are found in open habitats, primarily in scrublands, open woodlands, and grasslands of Australia. The birds are normally found in small flocks, but can form very large flocks under favourable conditions. The nomadic movement of the flocks is tied to the availability of food and water. Budgerigars have two distinct flight speeds which they are capable of switching between depending on the circumstance. Budgerigars sometimes swarm together in groups containing thousands of individuals.

Drought can drive flocks into more wooded habitat or coastal areas. They feed on the seeds of spinifex and grass, and sometimes ripening wheat. Budgerigars feed primarily on grass seeds. The species also opportunistically depredates growing cereal crops and lawn grass seeds. Due to the low water content of the seeds they rely on the availability of freshwater.

Outside of Australia, the only long-term establishment of naturalised feral budgerigars is a large population near St. Petersburg, Florida. Increased competition for nesting sites from European starlings and house sparrows is thought to be a primary cause of the Florida population declining from the 1980s. The more consistent, year-round conditions in Florida significantly reduced their nomadic behaviour. The species has been introduced to various locations in Puerto Rico and the United States.

== Behaviour ==
=== Breeding ===
Breeding in the wild generally takes place between June and September in northern Australia and between August and January in the south, although budgerigars are opportunistic breeders and respond to rains when grass seeds become most abundant. Budgerigars are monogamous and breed in large colonies throughout their range. They show signs of affection to their flockmates by preening or feeding one another. Budgerigars feed one another by eating the seeds themselves, and then regurgitating it into their flockmate&#x27;s mouth. Populations in some areas have increased as a result of increased water availability at farms. Nests are made in holes in trees, fence posts or logs lying on the ground; the four to six eggs are incubated for 18–21 days, with the young fledging about 30 days after hatching. In the wild, virtually all parrot species require a hollow tree or a hollow log as a nest site. Budgerigars will typically breed in captivity when provided with a nest box.

The eggs are typically one to two centimetres long and are pearl white without any colouration if fertile. Female budgerigars can lay eggs without a male partner, but these unfertilised eggs will not hatch. Females normally have a whitish tan cere; however, when the female is laying eggs, her cere turns a crusty brown colour. Certain female budgies may always keep a whitish tan cere or always keep a crusty brown cere regardless of breeding condition. A female budgerigar will lay her eggs on alternating days. After the first one, there is usually a two-day gap until the next. She will usually lay between four and eight eggs, which she will incubate (usually starting after laying her second or third) for about 21 days each. Females only leave their nests for very quick defecations, stretches and quick meals once they have begun incubating and are by then almost exclusively fed by their mate (usually at the nest&#x27;s entrance). Females will not allow a male to enter the nest, unless he forces his way inside. Clutch size ranges from 6 to 8 chicks.

There is evidence of same-sex sexual behaviour amongst male budgerigars. It was originally hypothesised that they did this as a form of &quot;courtship practice&quot; so they were better breeding partners for females; however, an inverse relationship exists between participation in same-sex behaviour and pairing success.

=== Chick health ===

Breeding difficulties arise for various reasons. Some chicks may die from diseases and attacks from adults. Other budgerigars (virtually always females) may fight over the nest box, attacking each other or a brood. Another problem may be the birds&#x27; beaks being under-lapped, where the lower mandible is above the upper mandible.

Most health issues and physical abnormalities in budgerigars are genetic. Care should be taken that birds used for breeding are active, healthy and unrelated. Budgerigars that are related or have fatty tumours or other potential genetic health problems should not be allowed to breed. Parasites (lice, mites, worms) and pathogens (bacteria, fungi and viruses), are contagious and thus transmitted between individuals through either direct or indirect contact.

In some cases, chicks will experience splay leg. This medical condition may be congenital or acquired through malnutrition. Chicks can be treated with splints although this method is not always successful in curing the affected bird. Preventative measures include using proper nesting box materials such as pine shavings and cleaning the nest box between uses.

=== Development ===

Eggs take about 18–20 days before they start hatching. The hatchlings are altricial – blind, naked, unable to lift their head and totally helpless, and their mother feeds them and keeps them warm constantly. Around 10 days of age, the chicks&#x27; eyes will open, and they will start to develop feather down. The appearance of down occurs at the age for closed banding of the chicks.

They develop feathers around three weeks of age. (One can often easily note the colour mutation of the individual birds at this point.) At this stage of the chicks&#x27; development, the male usually has begun to enter the nest to help his female in caring and feeding the chicks. Some budgerigar females, however, totally forbid the male from entering the nest and thus take the full responsibility of rearing the chicks until they fledge.

Depending on the size of the clutch and most particularly in the case of single mothers, it may then be wise to transfer a portion of the hatchlings (or best of the fertile eggs) to another pair. The foster pair must already be in breeding mode and thus either at the laying or incubating stages, or already rearing hatchlings.

As the chicks develop and grow feathers, they are able to be left on their own for longer periods of time. By the fifth week, the chicks are strong enough that both parents will be comfortable in staying out of the nest more. The youngsters will stretch their wings to gain strength before they attempt to fly. They will also help defend the box from enemies, mostly with their loud screeching. Young budgerigars typically fledge (leave the nest) around their fifth week of age and are usually completely weaned between six and eight weeks old. However, the age for fledging, as well as weaning, can vary slightly depending on the age and the number of surviving chicks. Generally speaking, the oldest chick is the first to be weaned. Although it is logically the last one to be weaned, the youngest chick is often weaned at a younger age than its older sibling(s). This can be a result of mimicking the actions of older siblings. Lone surviving chicks are often weaned at the youngest possible age as a result of having their parents&#x27; full attention and care.

Hand-reared budgies may take slightly longer to wean than parent-raised chicks. Hand feeding is not routinely done with budgerigars, due to their small size and because young parent raised birds can be readily tamed.

== Relationship with humans ==
=== Aviculture ===

The budgerigar has been bred in captivity since the 1850s. Breeders have worked to produce a variety of colour, pattern and feather mutations, including albino, blue, cinnamon-ino (lacewing), clearwing, crested, dark, greywing, opaline, pieds, spangled, dilute (suffused) and violet.

&quot;English budgerigars&quot;, more correctly called &quot;show&quot; or &quot;exhibition budgerigars&quot;, are about twice as large as their wild counterparts and have puffier head feathers, giving them a boldly exaggerated look. The eyes and beak can be almost totally obscured by these fluffy head feathers. English budgerigars are typically more expensive than wild-type birds, and have a shorter life span of about seven to nine years. Breeders of English budgerigars show their birds at animal shows. Most captive budgerigars in the pet trade are more similar in size and body conformation to wild budgerigars.

Budgerigars are social animals and require stimulation in the shape of toys and interaction with humans or with other budgerigars. Budgerigars, and especially females, will chew material such as wood. When a budgerigar feels threatened, it will try to perch as high as possible and to bring its feathers close against its body in order to appear thinner.

Tame budgerigars can be taught to speak, whistle and play with humans. Both males and females sing and can learn to mimic sounds and words and do simple tricks, but singing and mimicry are more pronounced and better perfected in males. Females rarely learn to mimic more than a dozen words. Males can easily acquire vocabularies ranging from a few dozen to a hundred words. Pet males, especially those kept alone, are generally the best speakers.

Budgerigars will chew on anything they can find to keep their beaks trimmed. Mineral blocks (ideally enriched with iodine), cuttlebone and soft wooden pieces are suitable for this activity. Cuttlebones also supply calcium, essential for the proper forming of eggs and bone solidity. In captivity, budgerigars live an average of five to eight years, but life spans of 15–20 years have been reported. The life span depends on breed, lineage, and health, being highly influenced by exercise and diet. Budgerigars have been known to cause &quot;bird fancier&#x27;s lung&quot; in sensitive people, a type of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Apart from a handful of illnesses, diseases of the species are not transmittable to humans.

=== Mimicry ===

Budgerigars, like many other species of parrot, are able to mimic human speech. Puck, a male budgerigar owned by American Camille Jordan, holds the world record for the largest vocabulary of any bird, at 1,728 words. Puck died in 1994, with the record first appearing in the 1995 edition of Guinness World Records. The budgerigar &quot;Disco&quot; became Internet famous in 2013. Some of Disco&#x27;s most repeated phrases included, &quot;I am not a crook&quot; and &quot;Nobody puts baby bird in a corner!&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Small bathing suits for men, commonly referred to as togs or &quot;Speedos&quot;, are informally called &quot;budgie smugglers&quot; in Australia. The phrase is humorously based on the appearance of the tight-fitting cloth around the male&#x27;s genitals looking like a small budgie. The phrase was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2016.

<text>Populus&quot; section &quot;Aigeiros is a section of three species in the genus &quot;Populus&quot;, the poplars. Like some other species in the genus &quot;Populus&quot;, they are commonly known as cottonwoods. The species are native to North America, Europe, and western Asia. In the past, as many as six species were recognized, but recent trends have been to accept just three species, treating the others as subspecies of &quot;P. deltoides&quot;.

They are large, deciduous trees that are tall and diameters of , distinguished by thick, deeply fissured bark and triangular-based to diamond-shaped leaves that are green on both sides (without the whitish wax on the undersides) and without any obvious balsam scent in spring. An important feature of the leaves is the petiole, which is flattened sideways so that the leaves have a particular type of movement in the wind.

Male and female flowers are in separate catkins, appearing before the leaves in spring. The seeds are borne on cottony structures that allow them to be blown long distances in the air before settling to ground.

The cottonwoods are exceptionally tolerant of flooding, erosion, and flood deposits filling around the trunk.

Although each of the three cottonwood species has a different leaf pattern, they all have the same general diamond leaf shape.

==Species==
===&quot;Populus deltoides&quot;===

Eastern cottonwood (&quot;Populus deltoides&quot;) is one of the largest North American hardwood trees, although the wood is rather soft. It is a riparian zone tree. It occurs throughout the eastern United States, parts of southern Canada, and northern Mexico. The leaves are alternate and simple, with coarsely toothed (crenate/serrate) edges, and subcordate at the base. The leaf shape is roughly triangular, hence the species name, &quot;deltoides&quot;. Their winter buds are enrobed in a protective, fragrant resin that coats young leaves when they unfurl from the bud.

In the typical subspecies &quot;P. d. deltoides&quot; (Vermont south to northern Florida and west to about Michigan), the leaves are broad and triangular, 7–15 cm across at the base. Further west (Minnesota south to eastern Texas), the subspecies &quot;P. d. monilifera&quot; (plains cottonwood; syn. &quot;P. sargentii&quot;) has somewhat narrower leaves, 5–10 cm wide at the base. This is also the state tree of Nebraska, Wyoming, and Kansas. In West Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado, the subspecies &quot;P. d. wislizeni&quot; (Rio Grande cottonwood; syn. &quot;P. wislizeni&quot;) occurs.
===&quot;Populus fremontii&quot;===
Fremont&#x27;s cottonwood (&quot;P. fremontii&quot;) is native to the southwestern United States and western Mexico. In the United States, the species can be found in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah. In Mexico, it can be found in the states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, Mexico State, and Puebla. It differs from the eastern cottonwood mainly in the leaves having fewer, larger serrations on the edge, and small differences in the flower and seed pod structure. Some taxonomists formerly considered &quot;P. fremontii&quot; to be a subspecies of &quot;P. deltoides&quot;.

===&quot;Populus nigra&quot;===
Black poplar (&quot;P. nigra&quot;) is native to Europe and Western Asia, is distinct in its much smaller leaves, across, with a more rhombic (diamond) shape.

==Cultivation and uses==
Cottonwoods are widely grown for timber production along wet river banks, where their exceptional growth rate provides a large crop of wood within just 10–30 years. The wood is coarse and of fairly low value, used for pallet boxes, shipping crates, and similar purposes where a cheap but strong enough wood is suitable. They are also widely grown as screens and shelterbelts. Many of the cottonwoods grown commercially are the hybrid of eastern cottonwood and black poplar, &quot;Populus × canadensis&quot; (hybrid black poplar or Carolina poplar).

Cottonwood bark is often a favorite medium for artisans. The bark, which is usually harvested in the fall after a tree&#x27;s death, is generally very soft and easy to carve.

Cottonwood is one of the poorest wood fuels; it does not dry well, and rots quickly. It splits poorly, because it is very fibrous. It produces a low level of energy per unit of volume of wood.

Cottonwoods serve as food for the caterpillars of several Lepidoptera.

<doc id="201022" wikidata="Q816063" url="?curid=201022" title="Bell number">
<text>In combinatorial mathematics, the Bell numbers count the possible partitions of a set. These numbers have been studied by mathematicians since the 19th century, and their roots go back to medieval Japan. In an example of Stigler&#x27;s law of eponymy, they are named after Eric Temple Bell, who wrote about them in the 1930s.

The Bell numbers are denoted formula_1, where formula_2 is an integer greater than or equal to zero. Starting with formula_3, the first few Bell numbers are
:formula_4 .
The Bell number formula_1 counts the different ways to partition a set that has exactly formula_2 elements, or equivalently, the equivalence relations on it. formula_1 also counts the different rhyme schemes for formula_8-line poems.

As well as appearing in counting problems, these numbers have a different interpretation, as moments of probability distributions. In particular, formula_1 is the formula_8-th moment of a Poisson distribution with mean 1.

==Counting==

===Set partitions===

In general, formula_1 is the number of partitions of a set of size formula_2. A partition of a set formula_13 is defined as a family of nonempty, pairwise disjoint subsets of formula_13 whose union is formula_13. For example, formula_16 because the 3-element set formula_17 can be partitioned in 5 distinct ways:

:formula_18
:formula_19
:formula_20
:formula_21
:formula_22

As suggested by the set notation above, the ordering of subsets within the family is not considered; ordered partitions are counted by a different sequence of numbers, the ordered Bell numbers. formula_23 is 1 because there is exactly one partition of the empty set. This partition is itself the empty set; it can be interpreted as a family of subsets of the empty set, consisting of zero subsets. It is vacuously true that all of the subsets in this family are non-empty subsets of the empty set and that they are pairwise disjoint subsets of the empty set, because there are no subsets to have these unlikely properties.

The partitions of a set correspond one-to-one with its equivalence relations. These are binary relations that are reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. The equivalence relation corresponding to a partition defines two elements as being equivalent when they belong to the same partition subset as each other. Conversely, every equivalence relation corresponds to a partition into equivalence classes. Therefore, the Bell numbers also count the equivalence relations.

===Factorizations===
If a number formula_24 is a squarefree positive integer, meaning that it is the product of some number formula_2 of distinct prime numbers, then formula_1 gives the number of different multiplicative partitions of formula_24. These are factorizations of formula_24 into numbers greater than one, treating two factorizations as the same if they have the same factors in a different order. For instance, 30 is the product of the three primes 2, 3, and 5, and has formula_29 = 5 factorizations:
:formula_30

===Rhyme schemes===
The Bell numbers also count the rhyme schemes of an &quot;n&quot;-line poem or stanza. A rhyme scheme describes which lines rhyme with each other, and so may be interpreted as a partition of the set of lines into rhyming subsets. Rhyme schemes are usually written as a sequence of Roman letters, one per line, with rhyming lines given the same letter as each other, and with the first lines in each rhyming set labeled in alphabetical order. Thus, the 15 possible four-line rhyme schemes are AAAA, AAAB, AABA, AABB, AABC, ABAA, ABAB, ABAC, ABBA, ABBB, ABBC, ABCA, ABCB, ABCC, and ABCD.

===Permutations===
The Bell numbers come up in a card shuffling problem mentioned in the addendum to . If a deck of &quot;n&quot; cards is shuffled by repeatedly removing the top card and reinserting it anywhere in the deck (including its original position at the top of the deck), with exactly &quot;n&quot; repetitions of this operation, then there are &quot;n&quot;&quot;n&quot; different shuffles that can be performed. Of these, the number that return the deck to its original sorted order is exactly &quot;Bn&quot;. Thus, the probability that the deck is in its original order after shuffling it in this way is &quot;Bn&quot;/&quot;n&quot;&quot;n&quot;, which is significantly larger than the 1/&quot;n&quot;! probability that would describe a uniformly random permutation of the deck.

Related to card shuffling are several other problems of counting special kinds of permutations that are also answered by the Bell numbers. For instance, the &quot;n&quot;th Bell number equals the number of permutations on &quot;n&quot; items in which no three values that are in sorted order have the last two of these three consecutive. In a notation for generalized permutation patterns where values that must be consecutive are written adjacent to each other, and values that can appear non-consecutively are separated by a dash, these permutations can be described as the permutations that avoid the pattern 1-23. The permutations that avoid the generalized patterns 12-3, 32-1, 3-21, 1-32, 3-12, 21-3, and 23-1 are also counted by the Bell numbers. The permutations in which every 321 pattern (without restriction on consecutive values) can be extended to a 3241 pattern are also counted by the Bell numbers. However, the Bell numbers grow too quickly to count the permutations that avoid a pattern that has not been generalized in this way: by the (now proven) Stanley–Wilf conjecture, the number of such permutations is singly exponential, and the Bell numbers have a higher asymptotic growth rate than that.

==Triangle scheme for calculations==
The Bell numbers can easily be calculated by creating the so-called Bell triangle, also called Aitken&#x27;s array or the Peirce triangle after Alexander Aitken and Charles Sanders Peirce.

# Start with the number one. Put this on a row by itself. (formula_31)
# Start a new row with the rightmost element from the previous row as the leftmost number (formula_32 where &quot;r&quot; is the last element of (&quot;i&quot;-1)-th row)
# Determine the numbers not on the left column by taking the sum of the number to the left and the number above the number to the left, that is, the number diagonally up and left of the number we are calculating formula_33 
# Repeat step three until there is a new row with one more number than the previous row (do step 3 until formula_34)
# The number on the left hand side of a given row is the &quot;Bell number&quot; for that row. (formula_35)

Here are the first five rows of the triangle constructed by these rules:

formula_36

The Bell numbers appear on both the left and right sides of the triangle.

==Properties==

===Summation formulas===
The Bell numbers satisfy a recurrence relation involving binomial coefficients:
:formula_37
It can be explained by observing that, from an arbitrary partition of &quot;n&quot; + 1 items, removing the set containing the first item leaves a partition of a smaller set of &quot;k&quot; items for some number &quot;k&quot; that may range from 0 to &quot;n&quot;. There are formula_38 choices for the &quot;k&quot; items that remain after one set is removed, and &quot;Bk&quot; choices of how to partition them.

A different summation formula represents each Bell number as a sum of Stirling numbers of the second kind
:formula_39
The Bell numbers can also be approximated using the Lambert W function, a function with the same growth rate as the logarithm, as 
:formula_40

 established the expansion
:formula_41
uniformly for formula_42 as formula_43, where formula_44 and each formula_45 and formula_46 are known expressions in formula_47.

The asymptotic expression

:formula_48

was established by .

==Bell primes==
 raised the question of whether infinitely many Bell numbers are also prime numbers. These are called Bell primes. The first few Bell primes are:
:2, 5, 877, 27644437, 35742549198872617291353508656626642567, 359334085968622831041960188598043661065388726959079837 
corresponding to the indices 2, 3, 7, 13, 42 and 55 . The next Bell prime is &quot;B&quot;2841, which is approximately 9.30740105 × 106538.

==History==

The Bell numbers are named after Eric Temple Bell, who wrote about them in 1938, following up a 1934 paper in which he studied the Bell polynomials. Bell did not claim to have discovered these numbers; in his 1938 paper, he wrote that the Bell numbers &quot;have been frequently investigated&quot; and &quot;have been rediscovered many times&quot;. Bell cites several earlier publications on these numbers, beginning with which gives Dobiński&#x27;s formula for the Bell numbers. Bell called these numbers &quot;exponential numbers&quot;; the name &quot;Bell numbers&quot; and the notation &quot;Bn&quot; for these numbers was given to them by .

The first exhaustive enumeration of set partitions appears to have occurred in medieval Japan, where (inspired by the popularity of the book &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;) a parlor game called &quot;genjikō&quot; sprang up, in which guests were given five packets of incense to smell and were asked to guess which ones were the same as each other and which were different. The 52 possible solutions, counted by the Bell number &quot;B&quot;5, were recorded by 52 different diagrams, which were printed above the chapter headings in some editions of &quot;The Tale of Genji.&quot;

In Srinivasa Ramanujan&#x27;s second notebook, he investigated both Bell polynomials and Bell numbers.

<text>Tukums (; ; ) is a town in Latvia and serves as the administrative center of Tukums Municipality. It is located in the eastern part of the historical region of Courland, and with more than 16,000 inhabitants Tukums is the 13th largest settlement in Latvia. It is also an important railroad junction, connecting the town with Riga, Jelgava and Ventspils. It has two railway stations — Tukums I and Tukums II.

== History ==
The historical center of Tukums developed between trade routes leading from the mouth of the Daugava River to Prussia. The oldest part is today&#x27;s Talsi Street that originated at the river named Zvirgzdupite where there used to be a castle mound with a wooden castle. From 1253 Tukums was ruled by the Livonian Order.

A masonry castle was built on the bank of the Slocene river at the end of the 13th century. The castle was surrounded by settlements of German tradesmen and craftsmen. A marketplace was formed in front of the castle and some new streets appeared later running in various directions from the marketplace.

With the development of trade in the 16th century a new straighter trade route to Prussia was built along a new street that is called Liela (large) Street today which had an important role in the life of the settlement. As a result, public buildings, major businesses, workshops and small shops were built around the street making it the unofficial high street of the area.

After the disintegration of the Livonian Order a new state, the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was established. Like many other settlements Tukums had suffered greatly the numerous feudal wars. Under the rule of Duke Jacob (1642–1682) Tukums experienced a rapid economic boom.
At the time, a new trade route was built from Tukums to Jelgava, the capital of Duchy of Courland and Semigallia. It was opened along today&#x27;s Jelgavas Street and another route towards today&#x27;s Raudas Street.

Inhabited by only 800 people at that time, the first dam was built and a lake made near the road to Jelgava which was followed by a flour mill and copper-making furnace which was then exported to foreign countries.

The new adornment of Tukums were the lake and the church spire which were added to the skyline in 1687.

After 1795, Courland was incorporated into the Russian Empire. In November of the same year the Russian Tsaritsa Katherine signed a document to divide Courland into regions and to grant regional center rights to several urban settlements, Tukums being one of them. The town borders were marked in 1800 and the first urban map was made two years later.

The town continued growing as it became home to 6 pubs and 131 private houses with around 690 male and 832 female inhabitants.

In 1806, the first school was opened while the street pavement was introduced in 1860. In 1875, street lighting were started with more rapid developments of the town being observed after the opening of the Riga-Tukums railway line in 1877. It is one of the lines connecting Tukums with neighboring town Ventspils.

There were 24 known enterprises functioning in Tukums in 1897 including tanneries, wood-carding mills, glue plants, potteries, food production facilities and the two windmills which are thought to have brought out the uniqueness of the townscape. The town eventually grew along with the rapid growth and development of these industries.

The rich are known to have built their houses in the eastern part around Elizabetes, Pils and Baznicas Streets, but the workers settled more to the West, forming an area of small houses surrounded by gardens. These areas of Tukums were further developed during the year in 1935.

In the beginning of the 1930s, there were 8000 inhabitants and 73 functioning industrial enterprises in Tukums.

In 2019, the town becomes home to the second largest tire recycling plant in Latvia.

== Places near Tukums ==
The Engure parish by the city was host to the Soviet Navy Tukums air base. It was converted into a civilian airport.

Jaunpils Castle is the only fortified castle of the Order of Livonia that remains in Latvia. It was built in 1301. An exhibition hall and museum are located there on the history of the district. Jaunpils Lutheran Church which was built in 1592 is located near the castle.

Jaunmoku Palace (1901), from Tukums, surrounded by the Courlands hills, hosts an exhibition on forestry. Jaunmoku Palace is a combination of Art Nouveau elements and Neo-Gothic forms and was built as the country residence of George Armitstead, mayor of Riga (1901–12).

Durbe manor house, () rebuilt in 1820, is a classical style palace, surrounded by a landscaped park. A stone bridge across the ravine and a rotunda are located near the manor house.

The Schlokenbeck estate ensemble in Milzkalne, dating from the 15th century, is the only fortified manor house in Latvia. A museum on the history of broad building techniques and an exposition of horse gear is set up there.

In Zante region there is the highest peak of Tukums district – Smiltinkalns (153m), in the center of Zante there is a Red Army tank, evidence of the battles in &quot;Courland Pocket&quot; in 1944–1945.

The country of Zentene and Seme has the northern landscape of Courland – hills, curved roads, objects of nature and places of culture history.

The seashore of Tukums district has a length of , where old fishermen&#x27;s huts alternate with modern villas, and sandy beaches interchange with rocky shores and meadows.

Kandava was the capital of the ancient Couronian state of Vanema. In the beginning of the 13th century, German knights built their castle there, though not much has been preserved from that time. In the Middle Ages, Kandava underwent numerous wars, fires and plague epidemics.

The Kandava hills are covered with dense forests and the Abava Rapids of the Abava River. Kandava marks the beginning of the run of the Abava Valley, which is often locally referred to as &quot;Switzerland of Courland&quot; in as early as the 19th century. Since January 2011, the valley has been on Latvia&#x27;s Tentative World Heritage List, according to World Monuments Fund.

<text>Bad Tölz-Wolfratshausen (Bavarian: &quot;Bad Däiz-Woifradshausn&quot;) is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the south and clockwise) Austria and the districts of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Weilheim-Schongau, Starnberg, Munich and Miesbach.

== History ==

The district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Bad Tölz and Wolfratshausen. Bad Tölz-Wolfratshausen has two castles, Castle Hohenburg and Seeburg (Münsing).

== Geography ==

Bad Tölz-Wolfratshausen is one of the alpine districts on the German-Austrian borders. The valley of the Upper Isar River separates the Bavarian Alps from the Karwendel, a portion of the Alps mainly located in Austria. The highest peak of the district is the Schafreuter (2,100 m).

The Isar River enters the district in the southwest and runs northwards, passing the two main towns of the district, Bad Tölz and Wolfratshausen. In the high alpine south there are several mountain lakes: Walchensee (16 km2), Kochelsee (6 km2) and Sylvensteinsee (an artificial lake in the course of the Isar River). In the northwest the district borders on Lake Starnberg (&quot;Starnberger See&quot;).

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays:
* the heraldic lion of the medieval county of Wolfratshausen
* the blue and white checkered pattern of Bavaria
* the staffs symbolising the famous Benediktbeuern Abbey

== Towns and municipalities ==

== Museums ==

* Erinnerungsort Badehaus (Remebrance Place Badehaus)

<doc id="201043" wikidata="Q5641800" url="?curid=201043" title="Half farthing">
<text>The half farthing was a British coin worth of a pound, of a shilling, or of a penny. The coins were minted in copper for use in British Ceylon in various years between 1828 and 1856, and as a bronze proof coin in 1868. In 1842, they were also declared legal tender in the United Kingdom. Half farthings were demonetised along with all other British copper coins on 31 December 1869.

==History==
The Royal Mint first produced half farthings in 1828 for use in British Ceylon, using dies by William Wyon. The obverse of the coin bore a left-facing portrait of George IV, with the legend and the date, while the reverse showed a seated Britannia with shield, facing right and holding a trident, with the inscription . The coins were made of copper, weighed 2.4 grammes, and had a diameter of 18 millimetres. The mint produced a second issue of George IV half farthings in 1830.

The mint produced one issue of half farthings during the reign of William IV in 1837. The obverse bore a right-facing portrait of William IV by Wyon with the legend and the date. The coins used the same reverse dies as the issues of George IV, and were struck with the same size and weight standards.

Wyon redesigned the half farthing for Queen Victoria&#x27;s first issue in 1839. The obverse used the same dies as Wyon&#x27;s Maundy fourpence, bearing a left-facing portrait of Queen Victoria and the legend . The mint completely redesigned the reverse to avoid any resemblance between half farthings and the fourpence coins introduced in 1836 and issued for Ceylon in 1839. The new reverse featured a royal crown above the words and the date. Below the date, the coins featured a heraldic rose with three leaves on either side. The mint produced additional issues in 1842, 1843, 1844, 1847, 1851, 1852, 1853, 1854, and 1856, all to the same size and weight standards as the issues of George IV and William IV, but with the rose emblem changed to a joint rose, thistle, and shamrock. The mint produced proof half farthings in bronze and copper-nickel in 1868, but no 1868 half farthings were issued for circulation.

Half farthings were made legal tender in the United Kingdom on 13 June 1842. Several letters to the editor in &quot;The Times&quot; criticised the proclamation. All British copper coins, including half farthings, were demonetised and taken out of circulation on 31 December 1869.

<text>Boris Franz Becker (; born 22 November 1967) is a German former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). Becker won 49 career singles and 15 doubles titles, including six singles majors: three Wimbledon Championships, two Australian Opens and one US Open. He also won 13 Masters titles, three year-end championships, an Olympic gold medal in men&#x27;s doubles in 1992, and led Germany to two Davis Cup titles in 1988 and 1989. Becker is the youngest-ever winner of the men&#x27;s singles Wimbledon title, a feat he accomplished aged 17 in 1985.

Becker is often credited as the pioneer of power tennis with his fast serve and all-court game. He is among the top ten players with the best win percentages in the Open Era. In 1989, he was voted the Player of the Year by both the ATP and the ITF. He holds a win percentage of 92.70% in Davis Cup singles rubbers, a win loss record of 38–3 and two championships for Germany. In his autobiography, Andre Agassi described Becker as the world&#x27;s most popular tennis star in the late 1980s. Becker was featured at number 18 in the list of &quot;Tennis&quot; magazine&#x27;s 40 greatest players of all time in 2006.
After his playing career ended, Becker became a tennis commentator and media personality, and his personal relationships were discussed in news outlets. He has engaged in numerous ventures, including coaching Novak Djokovic for three years, playing poker professionally, and working for an online poker company. In October 2002, the Munich District Court gave Becker a suspended two-year prison sentence for tax evasion. He declared bankruptcy in the UK in 2017. In April 2022, he was sentenced by UK courts to two and a half years in prison for hiding assets and loans that the court required him to disclose to creditors and the bankruptcy trustee. On 15 December 2022, he was released from prison early, having served eight months, and was deported to Germany by UK authorities.

==Early life==
Boris Becker was born in 1967 in Leimen, a town in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, the son of Elvira and Karl-Heinz Becker. Named after the Russian poet and novelist Boris Pasternak, young Becker was raised Catholic. His father Karl-Heinz, an architect, founded a tennis centre in Leimen, where Becker learned to play tennis. He received his secondary education at Helmholtz-Gymnasium in Heidelberg. His Sudeten German mother Elvira Becker, née Pisch was from the Moravian village of Kunewald (Kunín).

==Tennis career==
In 1974, Becker joined TC Blau-Weiß Leimen tennis club and began training under Boris Breskvar. By 1977, he was a member of the junior team of the Baden Tennis Association. He went on to win the South German championship and the first German Youth Tennis Tournament.

In 1977, he was chosen for the German Tennis Federation&#x27;s top junior team by Richard Schönborn. According to Schönborn, the funding for Becker&#x27;s training was put up by the German Tennis Federation at an expense of over 1.3 million DM. In 1981, he was included in the Federation&#x27;s first men&#x27;s team. In 1982, he won the doubles at the Orange Bowl International Tennis Championships.

Becker turned professional in 1984, under the guidance of Romanian-born coach Günther Bosch and Romanian manager Ion Ţiriac, and won his first professional doubles title that year in Munich. As a teenager, Becker won the Tennis World Young Masters at the NEC in Birmingham in 1985, before taking his first top-level singles title in June that year at Queen&#x27;s Club. Two weeks later, on 7 July, he became the first unseeded player and the first German to win the Wimbledon singles title, defeating Kevin Curren in four sets. Becker was at that time ranked 20th in ATP ranking, and was unseeded, as at that time Wimbledon did not seed players beyond the top 16. He was the youngest ever male Grand Slam singles champion at (a record later broken by Michael Chang in 1989, who won the French Open when he was ). Two months after his triumph, Becker became the youngest winner of the Cincinnati Open. Becker has since said that &quot;the plan from my parents for me was to finish school, go to university, get a proper degree and learn something respectful. The last thing on everyone&#x27;s mind was me becoming a tennis professional.&quot;

In 1986, Becker successfully defended his Wimbledon title, defeating No. 1 Ivan Lendl in straight sets in the final. In 1987 Becker, then ranked 2, lost in the second round of Wimbledon to Peter Doohan, ranked 70. In the Davis Cup that year, Becker and John McEnroe played one of the longest matches in tennis history. Becker won 4–6, 15–13, 8–10, 6–2, 6–2 (at that time, there were no tiebreaks in the Davis Cup). The match lasted 6 hours and 22 minutes.

Becker contested the Wimbledon final in 1988, where he lost in four sets to Stefan Edberg in a match that marked the start of one of Wimbledon&#x27;s great rivalries. Becker also helped West Germany win its first Davis Cup in 1988. He won the year-end Masters title in New York City, defeating five-time champion Lendl in the final. The same year he also won season ending WCT Finals for the rival World Championship Tennis tour, defeating Edberg in four sets.

In 1989, Becker won two Grand Slam singles titles, the only year he won more than one. After losing to Edberg in the French Open semifinals, he defeated Edberg in the Wimbledon final, and then beat Lendl in the US Open final. He also helped West Germany retain the Davis Cup, defeating Andre Agassi in the semifinal round after dropping the first two sets, in an epic spread over two days. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ranked it as among the best matches ever played, alongside the 1972 WCT Finals final between Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall, and the 1980 Wimbledon final between Björn Borg and John McEnroe. As a result, Becker was named Player of The Year by the ATP Tour.

In 1990, Becker met Edberg for the third consecutive year in the Wimbledon final, but this time lost in a long five-set match. He failed to successfully defend his US Open title, losing to Agassi in the semifinals. Becker reached the final of the Australian Open for the first time in his career in 1991, where he defeated Lendl to claim the No. 1 ranking. Another loss to Agassi in the French Open semifinals kept him from winning the first two Grand Slam tournaments of the year. He was ranked No. 1 for 12 weeks during 1991 and reached his fourth consecutive Wimbledon final. However, he lost in straight sets to fellow German and No. 7 Michael Stich. Becker and Stich developed a fierce rivalry, but teamed up in 1992 to win the men&#x27;s doubles gold medal at the Olympic Games in Barcelona.

In 1992, Becker won seven tour titles including his second ATP Tour World Championships defeating Jim Courier in four sets.

By 1993, issues back home over his courtship of and marriage to Barbara Feltus, whose mother was German and father was African-American, and tax problems with the German government, had caused Becker to slide into a mid-career decline.

By 1995 Becker had been in continual decline for half a decade due to losing interest in tennis and off-court reasons. That year he reached the Wimbledon final for the seventh time, defeating Agassi in the semifinals. In the final, however, Becker, further fatigued after gruelling baseline contests with Cédric Pioline and then with Agassi, lost in four sets to Pete Sampras. He won the year-end ATP Tour World Championships for the third and last time in Frankfurt with a straight-set win over Michael Chang in the final. Becker&#x27;s sixth and final Grand Slam title came in 1996 when he defeated Chang in the final of the Australian Open. After winning the Queen&#x27;s Club Championships for the fourth time, Becker was widely expected to mount a serious challenge for the Wimbledon title in 1996, but his bid ended abruptly when he damaged his right wrist during a third-round match against Neville Godwin and was forced to withdraw.
Becker defeated Sampras in October 1996 in a five-set final in Stuttgart Masters. &quot;Becker is the best indoor player I&#x27;ve ever played&quot;, said Sampras after the match. Becker lost to Sampras in the final of the 1996 ATP Tour World Championships in Hanover. Becker saved two match points in the fourth set and held serve 27 consecutive times until he was broken in the penultimate game. Later that year he won the Grand Slam Cup defeating Goran Ivanišević in the final. In 1997, Becker lost to Sampras in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. After that match, he vowed that he would never play at Wimbledon again. However, Becker played Wimbledon one more time in 1999, this time losing in the fourth round to Patrick Rafter.

Becker was most comfortable playing on fast-playing surfaces, particularly grass courts and indoor carpet (on which he won 26 titles). He reached a few finals playing on clay courts, but never won a single&#x27;s final there. Becker won an Olympic Gold Medal on clay court in doubles competition alongside compatriot Michael Stich at the 1992 Barcelona Games. Becker was close to winning a single&#x27;s clay-court tournament in his last final on the surface, when he led Thomas Muster by two sets to love in the 1995 Monte Carlo Open final, and double-faulted on set point in the fourth-set tiebreaker.

Over the course of his career, Becker won 49 singles titles and 15 doubles titles. Besides his six Grand Slam titles, he was also a singles winner in the year-end Masters / ATP Tour World Championships in 1988, 1992, and 1995, the WCT Finals in 1988 and at the Grand Slam Cup in 1996. He won a record-equalling four singles titles at London&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Club. In Davis Cup, his career win–loss record was 54–12, including 38–3 in singles. He also won the other two major international team titles playing for Germany, the Hopman Cup (in 1995) and the World Team Cup (in 1989 and 1998). He is the first male player to appear in 7 Wimbledon finals in the Modern Era, tied with Sampras and Djokovic, and behind the record 12 Wimbledon finals appearances by Federer.

Becker won singles titles in 14 countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Qatar, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States. In 2003, he was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. He occasionally plays on the senior tour and in World Team Tennis. After his career, he also took part in exhibition matches as Michael Stich and in 2005 they answered questions from the journalist and radio presenter Marc Engelhard about the state of tennis.
He has also worked as a commentator at Wimbledon for the BBC.

===Playing style===

Becker&#x27;s game was based on a fast and well-placed serve, that earned him the nicknames &quot;Boom Boom&quot;, &quot;Der Bomber&quot; and &quot;Baron von Slam&quot;, and great volleying skills at the net. He could supplement his pure serve-and-volley game with brilliant athleticism at the net, which included the diving volley that was considered a trademark of the young German, and which endeared him to his fans. The signature dives and rolls were never seen before Becker came to the scene, and the &#x27;Becker dive&#x27; and &#x27;Becker roll&#x27; became crowd pullers wherever Becker played. His heavy forehand and return of serve were also very significant factors in his game.

Becker occasionally deviated from his serve-and-volley style to try to out-hit, from the baseline, opponents who normally were at their best while remaining near the baseline. Even though Becker possessed powerful shots from both wings, this strategy was often criticized by commentators.

Becker had frequent emotional outbursts on court. Whenever he considered himself to be playing badly, he often swore at himself and occasionally smashed his rackets. In 1987, he was fined $2000 following a series of outbursts during the Australian Open in Melbourne, including breaking three rackets, &quot;twice throwing the ball in an offensive manner at the umpire, hitting the umpire&#x27;s chair on one occasion, spitting water in the direction of the umpire, and hitting three balls out of the court.&quot; Becker&#x27;s highly dramatic play spawned new expressions such as the &quot;Becker Blocker&quot; (his trademark early return shot), the &quot;Becker Hecht&quot; (a flying lunge), the &quot;Becker Faust&quot; (&quot;Becker Fist&quot;), the &quot;Becker Shuffle&quot; (the dance he sometimes performed after making important points), and &quot;Becker Säge&quot; (&quot;Becker Saw&quot; – referring to the way in which he pumped his fists in a sawing motion).

Becker, one of the most effective players in his era on grass courts and carpet courts, had less success on clay. He never won a top-level singles title on clay, coming closest when holding two match points against Thomas Muster in the final of the 1995 Monte Carlo Open. Becker did, however, team up with Michael Stich to win the 1992 men&#x27;s doubles Olympic gold medal on clay.

==Post-retirement==

In 2012, Becker described his approach to retirement. &quot;I had won so much by 22, a number of Wimbledon titles, US Open, Davis Cup, World number one. You look for the next big thing and that isn&#x27;t in tennis.&quot;

===Tax evasion conviction===
Becker was found guilty by the Munich District Court of deliberately making false statements regarding his place of residence on his personal income tax filings in order to save DM3.3 million.

A criminal investigation into his tax affairs began in December 1996 while he was still an active professional tennis player. By the time German prosecutors filed charges of tax evasion against the tennis star in July 2002, Becker had already retired from the sport. The retired tennis player, who had earned over US$25 million in prize money plus millions in endorsements, was originally charged with withholding taxes of DM10.4 million (US$5 million), however, the trial ended up being for the considerably lower sum of DM3.3 million (€1.6 million) for which prosecutors believed they had evidence. Throughout late summer and early fall 2002, leading up to the publicized trial that was to focus on where Becker lived between 1991 and 1993 (his tax filings claimed Monaco while the prosecution had evidence of the player in fact spending the majority of that time in the Munich area), most observers predicted the star would make a deal with the Munich public prosecutor&#x27;s office—admitting guilt in exchange for a lighter sentence.

As predicted, at his day in court on 23 October 2002, 34-year-old Becker admitted to living in Munich between 1991 and 1993 despite being officially registered in Monaco, however, maintaining he could not be accused of withholding income or engaging in criminal machinations. At the same time, as part of his defence, Becker emphasized that his property where he stayed in Munich was not a standard apartment but a &quot;spartan flat with just a bed and no refrigerator&quot; being part of his sister&#x27;s property where he stayed when visiting her. It also came out that he had been warned against purchasing the Munich apartment, but ignored the warnings. The player also told the court that the financial investigations that had begun in December 1996 played a role in his decision to retire from tennis due to &quot;countless raids of [his] house and office&quot; and that he &quot;hasn&#x27;t won any tournaments since then and ended [his] career&quot;.

Simultaneously with Becker&#x27;s testimony, his lawyer presented the court with evidence that a week prior to his court date, Becker had paid around €3 million in back taxes, far exceeding the DM3.3 million (€1.6 million) amount he was in the dock for. Despite the admission, as well as the payment, both seen as part of an attempt to settle the six-year process with a lighter sentence, the prosecution still asked the court for a sentence of three years and six months in jail.

One day later, on 24 October 2002, in a courtroom with public gallery packed with Becker&#x27;s fans, the Munich District Court judge Huberta Knöringer gave Becker a two-year prison sentence, the execution of which was suspended. Additionally, his sentence included a fine of €300,000 and another €200,000 to various charitable institutions.

===Investments===
Since 2000, Becker has been the principal owner of the tennis division of Völkl Inc., a tennis racket and clothing manufacturer.

Also in 2000, Becker partnered up with the German IT company Pixelpark AG for a joint dot-com investment: Sportgate.de, a German-language website covering local, regional and national sporting scene in Germany. The venture shut down during summer 2001, less than a year into its operation, amid reports of Becker&#x27;s business partner, Pixelpark&#x27;s CEO Paulus Neef who owned a 35% stake in Sportgate, failing to come up with a promised £1m cash injection. Paulus countered with a lawsuit against Becker in the Munich regional court for feeling &quot;conned&quot;.

Becker&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Augenblick, verweile doch...&quot; (en: &quot;The Player&quot;) was published in 2003. Its release made global headlines due to the tennis star&#x27;s divulgence of details surrounding his publicized divorce from Barbara Feltus, including an account of his 1999 sexual encounter with the Russian waitress Angela Ermakova that triggered the eventual end of his marriage to Feltus. Other personal disclosures in the book include revelations of addiction to painkillers and sleeping pills early into his tennis playing career as well as admission about promiscuity and excessive alcoholic intake as a way of coping with loneliness while on the road. The book made &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; bestseller list.

In May 2009, Becker announced the launch of online media platform &quot;Boris Becker TV&quot;. The website, in English and German, features clips from his career and footage of his daily life.

In June 2015, prior to the Wimbledon Championship that was the 30th anniversary of his first Wimbledon win, another Becker autobiography, &quot;Boris Becker&#x27;s Wimbledon: My Life and Career at the All England Club&quot;, was published with a foreword by the world&#x27;s number 1 player and reigning Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic whom Becker coached at the time.

===Tennis pundit and media personality===
====BBC====
In 2002, Becker became a commentator for the BBC at Wimbledon—a job he continued doing for the following two decades (apart from the 2014, 2015, and 2016 seasons when he coached Novak Djokovic). He moved to the United Kingdom from his native Germany in 2012, making London his primary residence.

During BBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2022 Wimbledon, which the German was absent from due to his incarceration over financial transgressions, imprisoned Becker received on-air messages of support from former broadcasting colleagues Andrew Castle, John McEnroe, and Sue Barker.

From October 2005 to June 2006, the German was a team captain on the British TV sports quiz show &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot; on BBC One. He furthermore appeared on the second episode of series 16 of the BBC&#x27;s car show &quot;Top Gear&quot; as the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car.

====Eurosport====
From 2017, as Becker was getting back into tennis punditry on television following a 3-year stint coaching Djokovic, the German began appearing on Eurosport regularly as part of its English-language Grand Slam coverage, often alongside the network&#x27;s other retired-tennis-players-turned-TV-personalities such as Mats Wilander and Barbara Schett or on his own German-language commentary show &quot;Matchball Becker&quot; alongside commentator .

In May 2022, shortly after Becker&#x27;s sentencing to 30 months in jail and initial detention at HM Prison Wandsworth, Eurosport reportedly explored the possibility of setting up a home studio in his prison thus potentially allowing him to participate on the network&#x27;s French Open coverage. Nothing came of it, however, and Eurosport eventually replaced Becker with Mischa Zverev while simultaneously renaming the &quot;Matchball Becker&quot; programme to &quot;Matchball&quot;.

Weeks after Becker&#x27;s mid December 2022 release from UK jail and deportation to Germany, Eurosport announced his re-hiring ahead of their 2023 Australian Open coverage.

===Administrative work===
After retiring from playing tennis, Becker has been on the economic advisory board of Bayern Munich for ten years.

On 23 August 2017, Becker was named the head of men&#x27;s tennis of the German Tennis Federation (DTB).

Becker is a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.

===Poker===
Becker is a noted poker player and has appeared in the European Poker Tour and the World Poker Tour; by 2013 he had won more than €90,000 in career earnings from poker. From November 2007 to mid-May 2013, Becker was a member of the celebrity team for the online poker platform PokerStars, where he participated in professional poker tournaments. Becker made his first appearance as a poker amateur at a tournament in Monte Carlo in April 2008. In mid-April, he entered the Main Event of the World Poker Tour at the Bellagio and finished the tournament in 40th place, winning more than $40,000 in prize money.

In August 2011, he came 97th at the European Poker Tour in Barcelona, winning €8,000. In April 2013 he again took part in the EPT Main Event, this time in Berlin, coming 49th with a win of €15,000. As of August 2018, Becker has made tournament earnings of over $100,000 and was ranked 132,133rd in the Global Poker Index. He has become an ambassador for the partypoker online poker platform, playing under the nickname Boris__Becker.

===Coaching Novak Djokovic===
In December 2013, Novak Djokovic announced on his website that Boris Becker would become his head coach for the 2014 season. As a result, Becker gave up his commentating job with the BBC. In December 2016, Djokovic and Becker parted ways. Over the three seasons they worked together, Becker contributed to Djokovic&#x27;s six Grand Slam titles and 14 Masters 1000 titles. Djokovic also won the French Open in 2016 – the only Grand Slam singles title which Becker never won himself.

===Bankruptcy===
On 21 June 2017, Becker was declared bankrupt by the Bankruptcy and Companies Court in London. The order arose when a 2015 debt—centered around an unpaid loan on Becker&#x27;s estate in Mallorca, Spain—owed to private bank Arbuthnot Latham for nearly $14 million was not paid in full before an assigned deadline, and there was no realistic expectation that it would be paid. Becker denied to the &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot; that he was &quot;broke&quot; or that he owed former business adviser Hans-Dieter Cleven any money; Cleven filed suit in a Swiss court claiming he was owed $41 million.

In June 2018, Becker&#x27;s lawyers claimed their client had diplomatic immunity in the bankruptcy case owing to his appointment as the Central African Republic&#x27;s (CAR) &quot;Attaché for Sports/Humanitarian/Cultural Affairs in the European Union&quot;. Charles-Armel Doubane, the CAR&#x27;s Foreign Minister, countered that Becker was &quot;not an official diplomat for the Central African Republic&quot;, that the role of attaché for sports &quot;does not exist&quot;, and that the CAR passport produced by Becker was one of a batch that had been stolen in 2014. In September 2019, the German businessman Stephan Welk who provided the passport was detained for possible fraud.

On 21 May 2019, Smith &amp; Williamson announced that it had instructed its agent Wyles Hardy to auction Becker&#x27;s trophies and memorabilia on 11 July 2019. On 24 June 2019, it was reported that Becker was forced to auction off 82 collectables from his personal collection, including a &quot;Goldene Kamera&quot; award and his trophy from the 1989 US Open, in order to pay creditors. On 11 July 2019, an online auction of Becker&#x27;s memorabilia was held, raising £687,000, according to the company dealing with his bankruptcy.

On 5 November 2019, the bankruptcy restrictions were extended for an additional 12 years, until 16 October 2031, after Becker was judged to have been hiding assets and transactions worth over £4.5 million.

===Imprisonment===
Becker was charged with illegally failing to hand over assets and trophies with a value of £2.5 million to repay debt during his bankruptcy, and on 21 March 2022, his trial began at Southwark Crown Court, London. On 8 April 2022, Becker was found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act. On 29 April 2022, he was sentenced to 30 months&#x27; imprisonment for the offences. His incarceration commenced at HM Prison Wandsworth in South London, before he was transferred to HM Prison Huntercombe, a facility used to detain foreign criminals. Becker was released from prison on 15 December 2022 having served 8 months. The same day he was understood to have been deported to Germany; he was eligible for automatic deportation having received a custodial sentence of more than 12 months. There are conflicting reports about his future eligibility to enter the UK, with some saying that he would be able to return to the UK in October 2024 at the earliest, and others that he is barred from entering the country for ten years.

===Documentary===
Becker is the subject of a two-part 2023 Alex Gibney documentary &quot;Boom! Boom! The World vs. Boris Becker&quot;, the first part of which premiered at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival.

==Personal life==
&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in 2009 that in addition to properties in Munich, Monaco, and Schwyz, Becker had an apartment in Wimbledon, and possibly still maintained a residence in Miami, to be near his children. As of 2017, Becker lived in Wimbledon, within walking distance of the championship grounds.

===Relationships===

After a relationship from 1988 to 1991 with Karen Schultz, and from 1991 to 1992 with Cassandra Hepburn, he began a relationship with Barbara Feltus, whom he married on 17 December 1993, when she was eight months pregnant, at the registry office of his hometown of Leimen. Before the marriage, they shocked some in Germany by posing nude for the cover of &quot;Stern&quot; in a picture taken by her father.

In January 1994 their son was born. Their second child was born in September 1999.

After Becker asked Barbara for a separation in December 2000, she flew to Miami, Florida, U.S.A., with Noah and Elias and filed a divorce petition in Miami-Dade County Court, sidestepping their prenuptial agreement which had entitled her to a single $2.5 million payoff. Barbara left for Florida after being contacted by a woman claiming to be pregnant with Becker&#x27;s child. In his autobiography, Becker stated that he admitted to his wife that he had had a one-night stand with another woman while Barbara was pregnant with their second child. He wrote that Barbara struck him during an argument after he flew to Florida to meet her and discuss the break up of their marriage. The pretrial hearing in January 2001 was broadcast live to Germany. The couple had dinner together every night during the hearing. Becker was granted a divorce on 15 January 2001: Barbara received a $14.4 million settlement, their condominium on Fisher Island, Florida, and custody of their children.

In February 2001, Becker acknowledged paternity of a daughter, , with a Russian waitress at London&#x27;s Nobu restaurant, Angela Ermakova, after media reported that he had a child as a result of a sexual encounter in 1999. Becker initially denied paternity, claiming he only had oral sex with Ermakova. His lawyers made allegations that Ermakova had stolen his sperm and used it to inseminate herself after the encounter. Subsequently, he reversed his stance and accepted fatherhood. Some time after that, a DNA test confirmed he was the father. In November 2007, he obtained joint custody of Anna after expressing concerns over how Ermakova was raising her.

Becker was briefly engaged to in 2008. Her father, Axel Meyer-Wölden, was Becker&#x27;s former adviser and manager. The couple broke up in November 2008.
In February 2009, Becker announced on the German TV show &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;, that he and Dutch model Sharlely &quot;Lilly&quot; Kerssenberg were to be married. The wedding took place on 12 June 2009 in St. Moritz, Switzerland. In August, they announced that they were expecting a child. Their son, Amadeus Benedict Edley Luis Becker, was born in London on 10 February 2010.

In May 2018, Kerssenberg and Becker announced that they had separated after nine years of marriage. The announcement was followed by multiple divorce and family court hearings throughout the remainder of 2018 amid the separated spouses each accusing the other of &quot;unreasonable behaviour&quot; and both issuing divorce petitions. As of Becker&#x27;s 2022 prison sentencing over financial transgressions, over four years since their separation, the estranged couple were still not legally divorced. Following Becker&#x27;s release from prison, in a February 2023 interview for the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper, Becker&#x27;s estranged wife Kerssenberg accused the retired tennis player of not paying child support for their 13-year-old son.

In July 2019, reports appeared that Becker was dating British model Layla Powell. At the time of his 2022 conviction, he was in a relationship with Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro. Eventually the couple married on 14 September 2024.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance was an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to female recording artists for works (songs or albums) containing quality vocal performances in the rock music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Originally called the Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female, the award was first presented to Donna Summer in 1980. Beginning with the 1995 ceremony, the name of the award was changed to Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. However, in 1988, 1992, 1994, and since 2005, this category was combined with the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance and presented in a genderless category known as Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo. The solo category was later renamed to Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance beginning in 2005. This fusion has been criticized, especially when female performers are not nominated under the solo category. The Academy has cited a lack of eligible recordings in the female rock category as the reason for the mergers. While the award has not been presented since the category merge in 2005, an official confirmation of its retirement has not been announced.

Pat Benatar, Sheryl Crow, and Tina Turner hold the record for the most wins in this category, with four wins each. Melissa Etheridge and Alanis Morissette have been presented the award two times each. Crow&#x27;s song &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood&quot; was nominated twice; one version from the album &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot; was nominated in 1999 (but lost to Morissette&#x27;s song &quot;Uninvited&quot;), and a live version from the album &quot;Sheryl Crow and Friends: Live from Central Park&quot; was nominated and won in 2001. Since its inception, American artists have been presented with the award more than any other nationality, though it has been presented to vocalists from Canada three times. Stevie Nicks holds the record for the most nominations without a win, with five.

<text>An ideograph or virtue word is a word frequently used in political discourse that uses an abstract concept to develop support for political positions. Such words are usually terms that do not have a clear definition but are used to give the impression of a clear meaning. An ideograph in rhetoric often exists as a building block or simply one term or short phrase that summarizes the orientation or attitude of an ideology. Such examples notably include &lt;liberty&gt;, &lt;freedom&gt;, &lt;democracy&gt; and &lt;rights&gt;. Rhetorical critics use chevrons or angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) to mark off ideographs.

The term ideograph was coined by rhetorical scholar and critic Michael Calvin McGee (1980) describing the use of particular words and phrases as political language in a way that captures (as well as creates or reinforces) particular ideological positions. McGee sees the ideograph as a way of understanding of how specific, concrete instances of political discourse relate to the more abstract idea of political ideology. Robertson defines ideographs as &quot;political slogans or labels that encapsulate ideology in political discourse.&quot; Meanwhile, Celeste Condit and John Lucaites, influenced by McGee, explain, &quot;Ideographs represent in condensed form the normative, collective commitments of the members of a public, and they typically appear in public argumentation as the necessary motivations or justifications for action performed in the name of the public.&quot; Ideographs are common in advertising and political discourse.

==Definition==
McGee uses the term in his seminal article &quot;The &#x27;Ideograph&#x27;: A Link Between Rhetoric and Ideology&quot; which appeared in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Speech&quot; in 1980. He begins his essay by defining the practice of ideology as practice of political language in specific contexts—actual discursive acts by individual speakers and writers. The question this raises is how does this practice of ideology create social control.

McGee&#x27;s answer to this is to say that &quot;political language which manifests ideology seems characterized by slogans, a vocabulary of &#x27;ideographs&#x27; easily mistaken for the technical terminology of political philosophy.&quot; He goes on to offer his definition of &quot;ideograph&quot;: &quot;an ideograph is an ordinary-language term found in political discourse. It is a high order abstraction representing commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal.&quot;

An ideograph, then, is not just any particular word or phrase used in political discourse, but one of a particular subset of terms that are often invoked in political discourse but which does not have a clear, univocal definition. Despite this, in their use, ideographs are often invoked precisely to give the sense of a clearly understood and shared meaning. This potency makes them the primary tools for shaping public decisions. It is in this role as the vocabulary for public values and decision-making that they are linked to ideology.

== Examples ==
There is no absolute litmus test for what terms are or are not ideographs. Rather, this is a judgment that must be made through the study of specific examples of discourse. However, McGee (and others who have followed him) have identified several examples of ideographs or virtue words in Western liberal political discourse, such as &lt;liberty&gt;, &lt;property&gt;, &lt;freedom of speech&gt;, &lt;religion&gt;, and &lt;equality&gt;. In each case, the term does not have a specific referent. Rather, each term refers to an abstraction which may have many different meanings depending on its context. It is in their mutability between circumstances that give the terms such rhetorical power. If the definition of a term such as &lt;equality&gt; can be stretched to include a particular act or condition, then public support for that act or condition is likely to be stronger than it was previously.

By encapsulating values which are perceived to be widely shared by the community, but which are in fact highly abstract and defined in very different ways by individuals, ideographs provide a potent persuasive tool for the political speaker. McGee offers the example of Richard Nixon&#x27;s attempt to defend his decision not to turn over documents to Congress during the Watergate scandal by invoking &quot;the principle of confidentiality.&quot; Recognizing that his refusal to submit to Congress could be seen as a violation of the &quot;rule of law&quot;, Nixon pitted &quot;the principle of confidentiality&quot; against the &quot;rule of law,&quot; despite the fact that these two ideographs would, in the abstract, not likely be seen as in conflict with one another. Nixon, in an attempt to expand the understanding of &quot;the principle of confidentiality&quot; to cover his own specific refusal to cooperate with Congress, used the abstractness of the term to his benefit, claiming that right to confidentiality was the more central term.

While the term has remained mostly in this sphere of academic rhetorical criticism, some political consultants and practitioners are becoming savvy to this art.

Ideographs appear in advertising and political campaigns regularly, and are crucial to helping the public understand what is really being asked of them. For example, &quot;equality&quot; is a term commonly used in political discourse and rarely defined. It can refer to a situation in which all people have the same opportunities, or a condition in which social resources are distributed uniformly to different individuals and groups. The former is the more commonly used definition in US history, according to Condit &amp; Lucaites, although in a socialist or left-leaning political state, the term may refer foremost to the distribution of social resources. Condit and Lucaites depict the racial facet of equality as the dominant meaning in an American context of political discourse, since 1865.

Another important ideograph used specifically by U.S. presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush after the 9/11 attacks is &lt;terrorism&gt;. The term does not have a clear or specific definition, but when applied to the context in the fear-stricken country after the devastating attacks in 2001, this term held significant weight and meaning to Americans all across the country. Kelly Long explores Obama&#x27;s discourse on the &lt;War on Terror&gt; and states that &quot;by developing an ideological justification for the conflicts that the United States was involved in at the time, Obama remedied much of the damage done by the Bush administration&quot;. Obama justified the &lt;War on Terror&gt; by addressing the nation and saying that in order to protect the &lt;rule of law&gt; and &lt;democratic values&gt;, we must fight against &lt;terrorism&gt;. Obama used this term to his advantage and made &lt;terrorism&gt; appear to be a common enemy and fighting back was the common cause. This use of the ideograph unified the country creating a sense of identity for American citizens, &quot;defining what the nation stands for and against. The term divides those who are civilized from those who are uncivilized, those who defend economic freedom from those who would attack America’s way of life and those who support democracy from those who would disrupt it&quot;.

Marouf Hasian discusses how key ideographs representative of a society&#x27;s commitments change over time, particularly in the name of &lt;liberty&gt;, &lt;equality&gt;, or &lt;privacy&gt; epitomized in eugenics. From the 1900s-1930s, Americans justified the restriction of reproductive rights based on medical, social, economic, and political considerations, but were appalled when the Nazis used some of the same arguments in their creation of the &quot;perfect race&quot;.

While rhetorical critics identify these terms as ideographs, political leaders viewed each other&#x27;s terms as &quot;glittering generalities,&quot; as Lincoln first identified his opponent&#x27;s words.

In addition to practitioners, corporate marketing and political consulting use key terms in this way, concentrating on the image and branding of terms. For example, Frank Luntz tests audience reaction to certain words or phrases using dial technology, a mechanism which instantaneously shows moment by moment reactions to speeches or presentations. This research has been extremely beneficial to his clients, as they can use ideographs as &quot;trigger words&quot; in an advertising campaign.

==Importance==
There are three primary ways in which the concept of the ideograph is important to rhetorical critics. First, it suggests a way of studying political ideology using concrete instances of language use. By showing how looking at specific uses of key words and phrases in political language reveal underlying ideological commitments, McGee offers a concrete method for understanding the highly abstract concept of ideology.

Second, the definition of the ideograph makes clear that the rhetorical study of a term is different from a legal, historical, or etymological study of a term. Unlike other perspectives that focus on how a term has changed over time, a rhetorical study of a term focuses on the forces involved in the creation of these meanings. In short, a rhetorical study of a term is the study of the use of that term in practice.

This leads to a third key aspect of what the concept of the ideograph offers to rhetorical critics. McGee notes that the study of a term must not, and should not, be limited to its use in &quot;formal discourse.&quot; Instead, the critic is much more likely to gain a better understanding of an ideograph by looking at how it is used and depicted in movies, plays, and songs, as well as how it is presented in educational texts aimed at children. This moves the study of ideology beyond the limits of social philosophy or even political discourse as traditionally conceived (i.e., &quot;great speeches by great men&quot;).

==Cultural variability==

&quot;An ideograph is a culturally biased, abstract word or phrase drawn from ordinary language, which serves a constitutional value for a historically situated collectivity.&quot;
There exists a culturally-specific understanding in each culture about what an ideograph means. Ideographs in rhetoric are culturally specific but recur inter-culturally; meaning the understanding of one ideograph can be used and interpreted differently across cultures. The idea may be different from culture to culture, but this doesn&#x27;t mean some aspects won&#x27;t be the same in one or more cultures. For example, the concept of femininity that exists cross-culturally to define ideas about women, yet one can expect these ideas to vary from culture to culture.

==Critical use==
At the end of his essay defining the ideograph, McGee says that
“A complete description of an ideology . . . will consist of (1) the isolation of a society’s ideographs, (2) the exposure and analysis of the diachronic structure of every ideography, and (3) characterization of synchronic relationships among all the ideographs in a particular context.”
Such an exhaustive study of any ideology has yet to materialize, but many scholars have made use of the ideograph as a tool of understanding both specific rhetorical situations as well as a broader scope of ideological history. As a teacher, McGee himself made use of the ideograph as a tool for structuring the study of the rise of liberalism in British public address, focusing on ideographs such as &lt;property&gt;, &lt;patriarchy&gt;, &lt;religion&gt;, &lt;liberty&gt;. Other scholars have made a study of specific uses of ideographs such as &lt;family values&gt; and &lt;equality&gt;. Some critics have gone beyond the idea that an ideograph must be a verbal symbol and have expanded the notion to include photographs. and objects represented in mass media.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal was awarded between 1980 and 2011.

The award was discontinued after the 2011 award season in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. Beginning in 2012, all solo or duo/group performances (including instrumental performance) in the rock category were shifted to the newly formed Best Rock Performance category.

U2 holds the record for most awards with a total of seven, followed by Aerosmith with a total of four.

<doc id="201063" wikidata="Q7785056" url="?curid=201063" title="Third farthing">
<text>The third farthing was a British coin worth of a pound, of a shilling, or of a penny. It was minted in copper in 1827, 1835, and 1844, and in bronze in various years between 1866 and 1913. While exclusively authorised for use in the Crown Colony of Malta, third farthings are catalogued as British coinage because they are fractions of British currency, and Malta otherwise used standard coins of the pound sterling.

==History==
When Malta became a British protectorate in 1800, the local monetary standard was the Maltese scudo issued by the Knights Hospitaller in the 18th century, though foreign currencies also circulated. One could be divided into 240 , which were small bronze coins. Colloquially, Maltese speakers referred to a (and later a third farthing) as a , the Maltese word for a &#x27;grain&#x27;. The lowest denomination of British coinage, the farthing, was equivalent to three grani.

In 1825, the British authorities made British coinage the monetary standard of Malta. On 3 November 1827, a proclamation declared British copper coins the colony&#x27;s sole legal copper currency and ordered that &quot;a copper coin of less value than the British farthing should be provided for the accommodation of the population&quot;. The Royal Mint issued 1,440,000 third farthings, or &quot;British grains&quot;, to replace the older . Although the third farthing corresponded to the British monetary standard, the coins were exclusively used in Malta and were not legal tender in the United Kingdom.

The Governor of Malta had requested that the coins bear the legend &quot;&quot;, but instead mint officials used the designs as William Wyon&#x27;s obverse and reverse for the British farthing. The obverse bore a portrait of George IV and the date, while the reverse depicted a seated Britannia with a shield and trident, surrounded by the legend . The 1827 coins were struck in copper and weighed between 1.5 and 1.6 grammes and had a 16-millimetre diameter. Subsequent issues were authorised in copper to the same size and weight standard in 1835 and 1844, bearing William Wyon&#x27;s obverse portraits of William IV and Queen Victoria, respectively.

In 1866, third farthings were issued in bronze instead of copper. They had a 16-millimetre diameter and weighed between 0.9 and 1.0 gramme. The obverse bore a portrait of a laureate Queen Victoria, while the reverse was redesigned to include the denomination and date surrounded by a wreath of oak leaves and a royal crown. Both sides were designed by Leonard Charles Wyon, and appeared on subsequent Victoria coins in 1868, 1876, 1878, 1881, 1884, and 1885.

In 1902, the British authorities issued £100 or 288,000 Edward VII third farthings, using an obverse by George William de Saulles and an updated version L. C. Wyon&#x27;s crown-and-oak-wreath reverse with an imperial crown. A final issue of £100 or 288,000 third farthings were struck in 1913 under George V. The obverse was by Bertram Mackennal, while the reverse reused the design of the 1902 issue with the imperial crown.

Although pre-decimal British coinage remained the Maltese monetary standard until May 1972, the third farthing appears to have gone out of circulation by the 1930s.

In 2015, the Central Bank of Malta issued 2,500 €5 gold bullion commemorative coins in honour of the third farthing. The obverse showed the date and emblem of Malta. The reverse was inspired by William Wyon&#x27;s seated-Brittania design of the 1827, 1835, and 1844 issues.

<text>The quarter farthing was a British coin worth of a pound, of a shilling, or of a penny. The Royal Mint issued the coins in copper for exclusive use in British Ceylon in 1839, 1851, 1852, and 1853. The mint also produced bronze proofs in 1868.

The obverse of the coins used William Wyon&#x27;s obverse die for the Maundy twopence, bearing a left-facing portrait of Queen Victoria and the legend . Wyon designed the reverse to feature a royal crown above the words and the date. Below the date, the coins featured a heraldic rose with three leaves on either side. The coins were made of copper, weighed 1.2 gramme, and had a diameter of 13.5 millimetres. The mint struck proof quarter farthings in bronze and copper-nickel in 1868, but did not issue any quarter farthings for circulation that year.

While quarter farthings were never legal tender in the United Kingdom, they are fractions of the British farthing, which was currency in Ceylon, and traditionally have been catalogued as British coinage.

<text>Symphony No. 22 in E major, Hoboken I/22, is a symphony written by Joseph Haydn in 1764, under the auspices of the benign Prince Nikolaus Esterházy. Its nickname is &quot;The Philosopher&quot; (German &quot;Der Philosoph&quot;).

==Composition and premiere==
The composition date of 1764 appears on the autograph manuscript, which survives. Haydn composed the work during his tenure as Vice-Kapellmeister at the court of Prince Nicolaus Esterházy. As Vice-Kapellmeister Haydn was in charge of all but religious music in the Esterházy household; in particular he was the leader of the orchestra and was expected to compose symphonies for it to perform. This ensemble numbered about fifteen players. The intended audience (except on special occasions such as the Prince&#x27;s name day) consisted only of the Prince and his guests; thus &quot;very often Haydn&#x27;s orchestra would have outnumbered the listeners.&quot; (Jones 1990:18).

Jones suggests that the first performance venue may have been what is today called the &quot;Haydnsaal&quot;, a large hall at the family palace in Eisenstadt &quot;having a very resonant acoustic&quot;. Other candidates were somewhat smaller halls in the other primary Esterházy palaces, at Vienna and Kittsee.

===The nickname &quot;The Philosopher&quot;===
The name (&quot;the Philosopher&quot;) is not on the original manuscript and is unlikely to have come from Haydn himself. &quot;Le Philosoph&quot; appears on a manuscript copy of the symphony found in Modena dated 1790; thus the nickname dates from the composer&#x27;s own lifetime. The title is thought to derive from the melody and counterpoint of the first movement (between the horns and cor anglais), which musically allude to a question followed by an answer and paralleling the disputatio system of debate. The piece&#x27;s use of a muted tick-tock effect also evokes the image of a philosopher deep in thought while time passes by. As Jones notes, the nickname &quot;becomes less appropriate as the symphony proceeds and earnestness gives way to high spirits.&quot;

==Scoring==
The work is scored for two cors anglais (English horns), two horns, and strings. The use of the cor anglais in place of the (related, but higher-pitched) oboe is more than unusual; indeed McVeigh (2009:386) suggests that it is &quot;the only symphony in the entire history of the genre to use this scoring&quot;. The horns play a prominent role in all but the second movement, and Haydn&#x27;s choice of E major may have been dictated by the fact that the valveless horns of the time sounded best when played as E instruments (that is, with E crooks inserted).

==Form==
The symphony is in four movements:

#Adagio, 
#Presto, 
#Menuet e Trio, 
#Finale: Presto, 

This slow-fast-slow-fast sequence of tempos corresponds to the sonata da chiesa of the Baroque era, although the musical language of the piece is classical. As with other early Haydn symphonies that use this tempo scheme, all of the movements are in the same key. The first, second, and fourth movements are in sonata form and the third is the customary minuet and trio in ternary form.

The first movement is the highlight of the symphony and features horns answered by cors anglais over a walking bass line. The violins play with mutes. H. C. Robbins Landon calls it &quot;surely one of the &quot;settecento&quot;&#x27;s supremely original concepts&quot;. Played with all the indicated repeats, it lasts about 10 minutes, almost half the duration of the symphony as a whole.

The second movement is extroverted, in very fast tempo, and features virtuosic playing from the string section. As commentators have pointed out, this movement would be too fast and light to begin a classical symphony on its own, but fits well after a slow opening movement. Later in Haydn&#x27;s symphonic career, the same effect would be achieved by placing a light opening theme after a slow introduction.

As McVeigh notes, the opening theme of the third movement echoes that of the first, resembling an extended rendition of it in minuet tempo. The trio section features writing in the high register for the two horns.

The last movement is one of the earliest examples of a &quot;hunting finale&quot; that would later be used in symphonies such as No. 65 and No. 73 &quot;La Chasse&quot;.

==Second version==
Another version of the piece, well known in Haydn&#x27;s time, was published by the Venier firm in Paris. This version has three movements with the second movement of the original version coming first, followed by a different movement that is marked &quot;andante grazioso&quot; in and concluding with the same finale as in the original version. The second movement (catalogued as H. I:22bis) is thought to be spurious, and arrangement as a whole not Haydn&#x27;s own. H. C. Robbins Landon suggests that this arrangement was likely made to the original composition due to the &quot;strangely original&quot; adagio and the existence of cors anglais, which were not available in many areas. It is precisely these elements that make this symphony so popular, so this version is seldom performed in modern times.

<doc id="201077" wikidata="Q1987958" url="?curid=201077" title="StarLAN">
<text>StarLAN was the first IEEE 802.3 standard for Ethernet over twisted pair wiring. It was standardized by the IEEE Standards Association as 802.3e in 1986, as the 1BASE5 version of Ethernet. The StarLAN Task Force was chaired by Bob Galin.

==Description==
An early version of StarLAN was developed by Tim Rock and Bill Aranguren at AT&amp;T Information Systems as an experimental system in 1983.
The name StarLAN was coined by the IEEE task force based on the fact that it used a star topology from a central hub in contrast to the bus network of the shared cable 10BASE5 and 10BASE2 networks that had been based on ALOHAnet.

The standard known as 1BASE5 was adopted as 802.3e in 1986 by members of the IEEE 802.3 standards committee as the Twisted Pair Medium Access Control sublayer and Physical Signalling sublayer specification in section 12.
The original StarLAN ran at a speed of 1 Mbit/s.

A major design goal in StarLAN was reduction in Ethernet installation costs by the reuse of existing telephone on-premises wiring and compatibility with analog and digital telephone signals in the same cable bundle. The signal modulation and wire pairing used by StarLAN were carefully chosen so that they would not affect or be affected by either the analog signal of a normal call, on hook and off hook transients, or the 20 Hz high-voltage analog ring signal. Reuse of existing wires was critical in many buildings where rewiring was cost prohibitive, where running new wire would disturb asbestos within the building infrastructure, and where the bus topology of coaxial bus Ethernet was not installable.

The wire positioning called &quot;T568B&quot; in the standard TIA/EIA-568 (later called &quot;ANSI/TIA-568&quot;) was originally devised for StarLAN, and pair 1 (blue) was left unused to accommodate an analog phone pair. Pairs 2 and 3 (orange and green respectively) carry the StarLAN signals. This greatly simplified the installation of combined voice and data wiring in countries that used registered jack connectors and American wiring practices for their phone service (connecting both to the same cable was a simple matter of using a pin–pin RJ45 splitter or punching down the same wires to two ports). This arrangement prevented harm to private branch exchange (PBX) equipment in the event that a StarLAN cable was plugged into the wrong device.

Since 1BASE5 reused existing wiring, maximum link distance was only approximated at 250 m; depending on cable performance up to 500 m was possible. Up to five chained hubs were allowed.

Parts of the StarLAN technology were patented by AT&amp;T and were initially part of a wider vision from AT&amp;T to link their UNIX-based AT&amp;T 3B2 minicomputers to a network of MS-DOS PCs. A StarLAN card was also offered for the AT&amp;T UNIX PC.

===StarLAN 10===

In 1988, AT&amp;T released StarLAN 10 operating at 10 Mbit/s. The original StarLAN was renamed StarLAN 1, reflecting its 1 Mbit/s speed.

It was adopted by other networking vendors such as Hewlett-Packard and Ungermann-Bass.
Integrated circuits were introduced starting in 1986 that reduced the cost of the interfaces.

StarLAN 10 and SynOptics LattisNet provided the basis for the later 10 megabit per second standard 10BASE-T. The 10BASE-T task force was chaired by Pat Thaler, a member of the StarLAN task force. 10BASE-T used the basic signalling of StarLAN 10 and added link beat. Some network interface cards such as the 3Com 3C-523 could be used with either StarLAN 10 or 10BASE-T, by switching link beat on or off.

<text>Matteucci effect is one of the magnetomechanical effects, which is thermodynamically inverse to Wiedemann effect. This effect was described by Carlo Matteucci in 1858. It is observable in amorphous wires with helical domain structure, which can be obtained by twisting the wire, or annealing under twist. The effect is most distinct in the so-called &#x27;dwarven alloys&#x27; (called so because of the historical cobalt element etymology), with cobalt as main substituent.

<text>The twisting of a ferromagnetic rod through which an electric current is flowing when the rod is placed in a longitudinal magnetic field. It was discovered by the German physicist Gustav Wiedemann in 1858
. The Wiedemann effect is one of the manifestations of magnetostriction in a field formed by the combination of a longitudinal magnetic field and a circular magnetic field that is created by an electric current. If the electric current (or the magnetic field) is alternating, the rod will begin torsional oscillation.

In linear approach angle of rod torsion &quot;α&quot; does not depend on its cross-section form and is defined only by current density and magnetoelastic properties of the rod:

:formula_1,

where
* formula_2 is current density;
* formula_3 is magnetoelastic parameter, proportional to longitudinal magnetic field value;
* formula_4 is the shear modulus.

== Applications ==
Magnetostrictive position sensors use the Wiedemann effect to excite an ultrasonic pulse. Typically a small magnet is used to mark a position along a magnetostrictive wire. The magnetic field from a short current pulse in the wire combined with that from the position magnet excites the ultrasonic pulse. The time required for this pulse to travel from the point of excitation to a pickup at the end of the wire gives the position. Reflections from the other end of the wire could lead to disturbances. In order to avoid this the wire is connected to a mechanical damper that end.
