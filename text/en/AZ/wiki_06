<text>The fourth USS &quot;Baltimore&quot; (C-3) (later CM-1) was a United States Navy cruiser, the fifth protected cruiser to be built by an American yard. Like the previous one, , the design was commissioned from the British company of W. Armstrong, Mitchell, and Company of Newcastle. &quot;Baltimore&quot; was an all-around improvement on &quot;Charleston&quot;, somewhat larger with more guns, thicker armor, and better machinery.

==Design ==

&quot;Baltimore&quot; was built to plans purchased from Armstrong, a British manufacturer, which were similar to an unsuccessful Armstrong bid for the Spanish cruiser &quot;Reina Regente&quot;. Unlike the preceding &quot;Charleston&quot;, these plans included a modern triple expansion engine designed by Humphrys, Tennant &amp; Co. &quot;Baltimore&quot;″s initial cost for hull and machinery was $1,546,172.13.

&quot;Baltimore&quot; was armed with four /35 caliber Mark 4 guns in sponsons on either side of the bow and stern, and six /30 caliber Mark 3 guns in sponsons along the sides. Secondary armament was four 6-pounder () guns, two 3-pounder () Hotchkiss revolving cannon, two 1-pounder () Hotchkiss revolving cannon, and two .45 caliber (11.4 mm) Gatling guns. Four 14-inch (356 mm) torpedo tubes were included in the design but never mounted.

&quot;Baltimore&quot; had gun shields and a thick armored conning tower. The armored deck was up to on its sloped sides and elsewhere.

The as-built engineering plant included four coal-fired cylindrical boilers producing steam for two horizontal triple expansion engines totaling for a designed speed of , although was achieved on trials. &quot;Baltimore&quot; was among the first US Navy ships with the more powerful and efficient triple expansion engines. Unlike some contemporary designs, no sails were fitted. &quot;Baltimore&quot; carried 400 tons of coal for a range of at ; this could be increased to 850 tons for .

&quot;Baltimore&quot; also was a testbed for a new kind of stockless anchor designed by Herbert O. Dunn. The anchor showed itself in the best sight and was later adopted as the US Navy standard.

===Refits===
&quot;Baltimore&quot; was rebuilt between 1900 and 1903 with the armament replaced by 12 /40 caliber Mark 7 guns, the 8-inch guns being removed. The secondary armament was replaced (or augmented) by six /50 caliber guns. The boilers were replaced with eight Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. In 1913 and 1914 she was converted into a minelayer at the Charleston Navy Yard with four 6&quot;/40 guns and a capacity of 180 mines. In an armament upgrade for World War I, between 1917 and 1918, her guns were replaced with four /51 caliber guns and two 3-inch (76 mm)/50 caliber anti-aircraft guns.

==Construction and Service history==

She was launched on 6 October 1888 by William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship and Engine Building Company, in Philadelphia, sponsored by Mrs. Theodore D. Wilson, wife of Chief Constructor Theodore D. Wilson; and commissioned on 7 January 1890, with Captain W. S. Schley in command.

===Pre-Spanish–American War===
&quot;Baltimore&quot; became the flagship of the North Atlantic Squadron on 24 May 1890, and, from 15 to 23 August, conveyed the remains of the late Captain John Ericsson from New York City to Filipstad in Värmland, Sweden.

After cruising in European and Mediterranean waters with the European Squadron, she arrived at Valparaíso, Chile on 7 April 1891 to join the Pacific Squadron. She protected American citizens during the Chile revolution and landing men at Valparaíso on 28 August. Her activities in Chile around this time became known as the &quot;Baltimore&quot; Crisis where two United States Navy sailors from its crew were stabbed in front of the True Blue Saloon on 16 October 1891. Arriving at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 5 January 1892, she cruised on the west coast of the U.S. until 7 October and then returned to the Atlantic. She took part in the naval rendezvous and review in Hampton Roads during March and April 1893, prior to the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. Proceeding via the Suez Canal, she cruised as flagship of the Asiatic Station from 22 December 1893 to 3 December 1895, protecting American interests. Returning to Mare Island on 21 January 1896, she went out of commission on 17 February.

===Spanish–American War===
Recommissioned on 12 October 1897, &quot;Baltimore&quot; sailed on 20 October for the Hawaiian Islands and remained there from 7 November 1897 to 25 March 1898. She then joined Commodore George Dewey&#x27;s squadron at Hong Kong on 22 April. The squadron sailed from Mirs Bay, China on 27 April for the Philippines, and on the morning of 1 May entered Manila Bay and destroyed the Spanish fleet stationed there. &quot;Baltimore&quot; was second in line behind . In the Battle of Manila Bay, &quot;Baltimore&quot; was commanded by future Rear Admiral Nehemiah Dyer, who had served with Farragut at Mobile Bay.

&quot;Baltimore&quot; remained in the Philippines on the Asiatic Station as the Spanish–American War transitioned into the Philippine–American War, convoying transports and protecting American interests until 23 May 1900, when she sailed for the United States, via the Suez Canal, arriving at New York on 8 September. In one instance, just before the outbreak of the Philippine–American War, the &quot;Baltimore&quot; sailed for Iloilo City accompanying troops whose mission was to occupy the city before General Martin Delgado&#x27;s forces, loosely part of Emilio Aquinaldo&#x27;s Philippine Revolutionary Army, could do so. When the American forces arrived, General Delgado already occupied the city in the name of the Federal State of the Visayas. After several weeks of a tense but peaceful stand-off, American troops and ships, including the &quot;Baltimore&quot; withdrew to Manila without landing on either Panay or Guimaras islands.

===Pre-World War I===
Between 27 September 1900 and 6 May 1903, &quot;Baltimore&quot; was out of commission at New York Navy Yard. From 5 August to 23 December, she served with the Caribbean Squadron, North Atlantic Fleet, taking part in summer maneuvers off the coast of Maine, in the Presidential Review at Oyster Bay, New York (15–17 August), and in Santo Domingo waters. From 28 May to 26 August 1904, she was attached to the European Squadron and cruised in the Mediterranean. On 26 September, she sailed from Genoa, Italy, for the Asiatic Station and spent the next two years cruising in Asiatic, Philippine, and Australian waters.

&quot;Baltimore&quot; returned to New York on 24 April 1907 and went out of commission at New York Navy Yard on 15 May. On 20 January 1911, she was placed in commission in reserve and served as a receiving ship at Charleston Navy Yard (30 January 1911 – 20 September 1912). From 1913 to 1914, she was converted to a minelayer at the Charleston Navy Yard and recommissioned on 8 March 1915. From 1915 to 1918, she carried out mining experiments and operations in the Chesapeake Bay and along the Atlantic coast.

===World War I===
At the time of the American entry into World War I, &quot;Baltimore&quot; was training personnel. Early in March 1918, she was detailed to assist in laying a deep minefield off the north coast of Ireland in the North Channel. She arrived at the Clyde on 8 March, and, from 13 April to 2 May, laid approximately 900 mines in the North Channel. On 2 June, she joined Mine Squadron 1 at Inverness, Scotland, and for four months participated in laying the North Sea Mine Barrage between the Orkney Islands and Norway by laying a total of 1,260 mines:
* planting 180 mines during the 1st minelaying excursion on 7 June,
* planting 180 mines during the 3rd minelaying excursion on 14 July,
* planting 180 mines during the 4th minelaying excursion on 29 July,
* planting 180 mines during the 5th minelaying excursion on 8 August,
* planting 180 mines during the 6th minelaying excursion on 18 August,
* planting 180 mines during the 7th minelaying excursion on 26 August, and
* planting 180 mines during the 9th minelaying excursion on 20 September.
On 28 September, &quot;Baltimore&quot; sailed from Scapa Flow, Orkney Islands back to the U.S. She carried out mining experiments in the vicinity of the Virgin Islands until the end of the year.

===Inter-war period===
In September 1919, she joined the Pacific Fleet, received the designation CM-1 (cruiser minelayer), and remained on the West Coast until January 1921. She then proceeded to Pearl Harbor, where she was subsequently placed out of commission on 15 September 1922. She then served as a receiving ship at Pearl Harbor, and was present during the Japanese attack there on 7 December 1941. She was sold for scrapping on 16 February 1942, but she was eventually towed out to sea and scuttled by Seabee demolition men on 22 September 1944. In August 2017, the wreck was discovered by Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory (HURL) off the south shore of Oahu. In September 2017, &quot;Baltimore&quot; was revisited by the Okeanos Explorer and surveyed in detail for photogrammetry.

&quot;Baltimore&quot; was laid down on 26 May 1941 at Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. She was launched on 28 July 1942, sponsored by the wife of the mayor of Baltimore, Howard W. Jackson, and commissioned on 15 April 1943.

==Operational history==
===World War II===

Following fitting-out, &quot;Baltimore&quot; departed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 17 June 1943, briefly visited the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, on 20 June, then conducted exercises off the Virginia Capes on 22 June. She went to Naval Station Norfolk at Norfolk, Virginia, for upkeep between 24 June and 1 July, when she departed for shakedown off Trinidad. Operating from Port of Spain, she conducted gunnery training before returning to Hampton Roads on 24 July. On 28 July, she departed for Boston, Massachusetts, to visit the Boston Navy Yard for post-shakedown availability i.e., (repairs to correct deficiencies found during shakedown) and to correct a leak in the main battery hydraulic piping. Returning to Norfolk in early September 1943 after the completion of the repairs, &quot;Baltimore&quot; and the destroyer departed for the United States West Coast. They transited the Panama Canal on 25 September 1943 and arrived at the San Diego Naval Base in San Diego, California, on 4 October 1943, after which she trained off the U.S. West Coast from 9 to 13 October. Departing San Diego on 16 October, she called briefly at San Francisco, California, then arrived at Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, independently on 29 October 1943.

Between November 1943 and June 1944 &quot;Baltimore&quot; was a unit of the fire support and covering forces in the invasion of Butaritari, known to the Americans during World War II as &quot;Makin Island&quot; or &quot;Makin Atoll&quot; (20 November–4 December 1943); the invasion of Kwajalein Atoll (29 January–8 February 1944); Operation Hailstone, a major raid on and the Truk Atoll (16–17 February 1944); and the seizure of Eniwetok Atoll (17 February–2 March 1944). On 17 February 1944, Lieutenant (junior grade) Denver M. Baxter, USNR, flying one of &quot;Baltimore&quot;′s Vought OS2U Kingfisher floatplanes, covered by two Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters, rescued Lieutenant (junior grade) George M. Blair, USNR, of Fighting Squadron 9 (VF-9) less than from Japanese-held Dublon Island inside Truk Lagoon, where Blair had ditched his Hellcat.

&quot;Baltimore&quot; continued to provide fire support in the Marianas attacks (21–22 February), the Palau-Yap-Ulithi-Woleai raid (30 March–1 April 1944), the invasion of Hollandia (21–24 April 1944); the Truk-Satawan-Ponape raid (29 April–1 May 1944); air strikes against Marcus Island (19–20 May 1944) and Wake Island (23 May 1944); the invasion of Saipan (11–24 June 1944); and the Battle of the Philippine Sea (19–20 June 1944).

Returning to the United States in July 1944, &quot;Baltimore&quot; embarked President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his party and steamed to Pearl Harbor. After Roosevelt met with Admiral Chester Nimitz and General Douglas MacArthur, &quot;Baltimore&quot; transported him to the Territory of Alaska. where he disembarked on 3 August 1944. He would arrive at the Washington Ship Yards on 9 August.

Returning to the war zone in November 1944, &quot;Baltimore&quot; was assigned to the United States Third Fleet and participated in the attacks on Luzon (14–16 December 1944 and 6–7 January 1945); Taiwan (3–4, 9, 15, and 21 January 1945), the China coast (12 and 16 January 1945), and Okinawa (22 January 1945). On 26 January 1945 she joined the United States Fifth Fleet for her final operations of the war: Honshū attacks (16–17 February 1945), the invasion of Iwo Jima (19 February–5 March 1945), and the Fifth Fleet raids in support of the invasion of Okinawa (18 March–10 June 1945).

== Post-World War II==
After World War II concluded in August 1945, &quot;Baltimore&quot; took part in Operation Magic Carpet, then was part of the naval occupation force in Japan from 29 November 1945 to 17 February 1946). Departing the Far East on 17 February 1946, she returned to the United States and was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 8 July 1946 at Bremerton, Washington.

&quot;Baltimore&quot; was recommissioned 28 November 1951 and assigned to the United States Atlantic Fleet. She deployed with the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean during the summers of 1952, 1953, and 1954. In June 1953 she represented the United States Navy in the British Fleet Review at Spithead. On 5 January 1955 she was transferred to the United States Pacific Fleet. She deployed with the United States Seventh Fleet in the Far East between February and August 1955.

&quot;Baltimore&quot; commenced pre-inactivation overhaul on her return from the Far East and went out of commission in reserve at Bremerton on 31 May 1956 after just years of active service. She was struck from the Navy List 15 February 1971, sold 10 April 1972 to Zidell Ship Dismantling Company Portland, Oregon, and scrapped in September 1972.

== Awards ==
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with nine battle stars 
* World War II Victory Medal
* Navy Occupation Service Medal with &quot;EUROPE&quot; and &quot;ASIA&quot; clasps
* National Defense Service Medal

==Alleged sinking by North Korea==
The Victorious War Museum in Pyongyang, North Korea, has several exhibits that claim the &quot;Baltimore&quot; was sunk by motor torpedo boats belonging to the Korean People&#x27;s Navy in the Korean War during the Battle of Chumonchin Chan on 2 July 1950. Exhibits include a poster and the &quot;actual&quot; boat which supposedly sank &quot;Baltimore&quot;. However, the ship was in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s decommissioned reserve from 1946 to 1951 before being recommissioned and assigned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Baltimore&quot; did not return to the Far East until 1955, when she was transferred to the U.S. Pacific Fleet two years after the end of the Korean War.

The actual battle involved the U.S. Navy light cruiser , the Royal Navy sloop and light cruiser . Together they destroyed several North Korean motor torpedo boats without loss or damage to themselves. Nonetheless, in 2023 North Korea named a North Korean People&#x27;s Navy &quot;Sinpo&quot;-C class submarine &quot;Hero Kim Kun Ok&quot; after the North Korean naval leader who claimed to have sunk &quot;Baltimore&quot; on 2 July 1950.

<text>A movie camera (also known as a film camera and cine-camera) is a type of photographic camera that rapidly takes a sequence of photographs, either onto film stock or an image sensor, in order to produce a moving image to display on a screen. In contrast to the still camera, which captures a single image at a time, the movie camera takes a series of images by way of an intermittent mechanism or by electronic means; each image is a &quot;frame&quot; of film or video. The frames are projected through a movie projector or a video projector at a specific frame rate (number of frames per second) to show the moving picture. When projected at a high enough frame rate (24 frames per second or more), the persistence of vision allows the eyes and brain of the viewer to merge the separate frames into a continuous moving picture.

== History ==
A forerunner to the movie camera was the machine invented by Francis Ronalds at the Kew Observatory in 1845. A photosensitive surface was drawn slowly past the aperture diaphragm of the camera by a clockwork mechanism to enable continuous recording over a 12- or 24-hour period. Ronalds applied his cameras to trace the ongoing variations of scientific instruments and they were used in observatories around the world for over a century.

The chronophotographic gun was invented in 1882 by Étienne-Jules Marey, a French scientist and chronophotographer. It could shoot 12 images per second and was the first invention to capture moving images on the same chronomatographic plate using a metal shutter.

In 1876, Wordsworth Donisthorpe proposed a camera to take a series of pictures on glass plates, to be printed on a roll of paper film. In 1889, he would patent a moving picture camera in which the film moved continuously. Another film camera was designed in England by Frenchman Louis Le Prince in 1888. He had built a 16 lens camera in 1887 at his workshop in Leeds. The first 8 lenses would be triggered in rapid succession by an electromagnetic shutter on the sensitive film; the film would then be moved forward allowing the other 8 lenses to operate on the film. After much trial and error, he was finally able to develop a single-lens camera in 1888, which he used to shoot sequences of moving pictures on paper film, including the &quot;Roundhay Garden Scene&quot; and &quot;Leeds Bridge&quot;.

In June 1878, Eadweard Muybridge created sequential series of photographs with a battery of 12 cameras along the race track at Stanford&#x27;s Palo Alto Stock Farm (now the campus of Stanford University). The shutters were automatically triggered when the wheel of a cart or the breast or legs of a horse tripped wires connected to an electromagnetic circuit.

Another early pioneer was the British inventor William Friese-Greene. In 1887, he began to experiment with the use of paper film, made transparent through oiling, to record motion pictures. He also said he attempted using experimental celluloid, made with the help of Alexander Parkes. In 1889, Friese-Greene took out a patent for a moving picture camera that was capable of taking up to ten photographs per second. Another model, built in 1890, used rolls of the new Eastman celluloid film, which he had perforated. A full report on the patented camera was published in the British &quot;Photographic News&quot; on February 28, 1890. He showed his cameras and film shot with them on many occasions, but never projected his films in public. He also sent details of his invention to the American inventor Thomas Edison in February 1890, which was also seen by Dickson (see below).


William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, a Scottish inventor and employee of Edison, designed the Kinetograph Camera in 1891. The camera was powered by an electric motor and was capable of shooting with the new sprocketed film. To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the sprocket wheel that engaged the strip was driven by an escapement disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement that would be the foundation for the next century of cinematography.

The Lumière Domitor camera, owned by brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière, was created by Charles Moisson, the chief mechanic at the Lumière works in Lyon in 1894. The camera used paper film 35 millimeters wide, but in 1895, the Lumière brothers shifted to celluloid film, which they bought from New-York&#x27;s Celluloid Manufacturing Co. This they covered with their own Etiquette-bleue emulsion, had it cut into strips and perforated.

In 1894, the Polish inventor Kazimierz Prószyński constructed a projector and camera in one, an invention he called the Pleograph.

=== Mass-market ===
Due to the work of Le Prince, Friese-Greene, Edison, and the Lumière brothers, the movie camera had become a practical reality by the mid-1890s. The first firms were soon established for the manufacture of movie camera, including Birt Acres, Eugene Augustin Lauste, Dickson, Pathé frères, Prestwich, Newman &amp; Guardia, de Bedts, Gaumont-Démény, Schneider, Schimpf, Akeley, Debrie, Bell &amp; Howell, Leonard-Mitchell, Ertel, Ernemann, Eclair, Stachow, Universal, Institute, Wall, Lytax, and many others.

The Aeroscope was built and patented in England in the period 1909–1911 by Polish inventor Kazimierz Prószyński. Aeroscope was the first successful hand-held operated film camera. The cameraman did not have to turn the crank to advance the film, as in all cameras of that time, so he could operate the camera with both hands, holding the camera and controlling the focus. This made it possible to film with the Aeroscope in difficult circumstances including from the air and for military purposes.

The first all-metal cine camera was the Bell &amp; Howell Standard of 1911-12. One of the most complicated models was the Mitchell-Technicolor Beam Splitting Three-Strip Camera of 1932. With it, three colour separation originals are obtained behind a purple, a green, and a red light filter, the latter being part of one of the three different raw materials in use.

In 1923, Eastman Kodak introduced a 16mm film stock, principally as a lower-cost alternative to 35 mm and several camera makers launched models to take advantage of the new market of amateur movie-makers. Thought initially to be of inferior quality to 35 mm, 16 mm cameras continued to be manufactured until the 2000s by the likes of Bolex, Arri, and Aaton.
=== Digital movie cameras ===


Digital movie cameras do not use analog film stock to capture images, as had been the standard since the 1890s. Rather, an electronic image sensor is employed and the images are typically recorded on hard drives or flash memoryusing a variety of acquisition formats. Digital SLR cameras (DSLR) designed for consumer use have also been used for some low-budget independent productions.

Since the 2010s, digital movie cameras have become the dominant type of camera in the motion picture industry, being employed in film, television productions and even (to a lesser extent) video games. In response to this, movie director Martin Scorsese started the non-profit organisation The Film Foundation to preserve the use of film in movie makingas many filmmakers feel digital cameras do not convey the depth or emotion that motion-picture film does. Other major directors involved in the organisation include Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan and many more.

== Technical details ==
Most of the optical and mechanical elements of a movie camera are also present in the movie projector. The requirements for film tensioning, take-up, intermittent motion, loops, and rack positioning are almost identical. The camera will not have an illumination source and will maintain its film stock in a light-tight enclosure. A camera will also have exposure control via an iris aperture located on the lens. The righthand side of the camera is often referred to by camera assistants as &quot;the dumb side&quot; because it usually lacks indicators or readouts and access to the film threading, as well as lens markings on many lens models. Later equipment often had done much to minimize these shortcomings, although access to the film movement block by both sides is precluded by basic motor and electronic design necessities. Advent of digital cameras reduced the above mechanism to a minimum removing much of the shortcomings.
The standardized frame rate for commercial sound film is 24 frames per second. The standard commercial (i.e., movie-theater film) width is 35 millimeters, while many other film formats exist. The standard aspect ratios are 1.66:1, 1.85:1, and 2.39:1 (anamorphic). NTSC video (common in North America and Japan) plays at 29.97 frame/s; PAL (common in most other countries) plays at 25 frames. These two television and video systems also have different resolutions and color encodings. Many of the technical difficulties involving film and video concern translation between the different formats. Video aspect ratios are 4:3 (1.33:1) for full screen and 16:9 (1.78:1) for widescreen.

=== Multiple cameras ===
Multiple cameras may be placed side-by-side to record a single angle of a scene and repeated throughout the runtime. The film is then later projected simultaneously, either on a single three-image screen (Cinerama) or upon multiple screens forming a complete circle, with gaps between screens through which the projectors illuminate an opposite screen. (See Circle-Vision 360°) Convex and concave mirrors are used in cameras as well as mirrors.

=== Sound synchronization ===

One of the problems in film is synchronizing a sound recording with the film. Most film cameras do not record sound internally; instead, the sound is captured separately by a precision audio device (see double-system recording). The exceptions to this are the single-system news film cameras, which had either an optical—or later—magnetic recording head inside the camera. For optical recording, the film only had a single perforation and the area where the other set of perforations would have been was exposed to a controlled bright light that would burn a waveform image that would later regulate the passage of light and playback the sound. For magnetic recording, that same area of the single perf 16 mm film that was prestriped with a magnetic stripe. A smaller balance stripe existed between the perforations and the edge to compensate the thickness of the recording stripe to keep the film wound evenly.

Double-system cameras are generally categorized as either &quot;sync&quot; or &quot;non-sync.&quot; Sync cameras use crystal-controlled motors that ensure that film is advanced through the camera at a precise speed. In addition, they&#x27;re designed to be quiet enough to not hamper sound recording of the scene being shot. Non-sync or &quot;MOS&quot; cameras do not offer these features; any attempt to match location sound to these cameras&#x27; footage will eventually result in &quot;sync drift&quot;, and the noise they emit typically renders location sound recording useless.

To synchronize double-system footage, the clapper board which typically starts a take is used as a reference point for the editor to match the picture to the sound (provided the scene and take are also called out so that the editor knows which picture take goes with any given sound take). It also permits scene and take numbers and other essential information to be seen on the film itself. Aaton cameras have a system called AatonCode that can &quot;jam sync&quot; with a timecode-based audio recorder and prints a digital timecode directly on the edge of the film itself. However, the most commonly used system at the moment is unique identifier numbers exposed on the edge of the film by the film stock manufacturer (KeyKode is the name for Kodak&#x27;s system). These are then logged (usually by a computer editing system, but sometimes by hand) and recorded along with audio timecode during editing. In the case of no better alternative, a handclap can work if done clearly and properly, but often a quick tap on the microphone (provided it is in the frame for this gesture) is preferred.

One of the most common uses of non-sync cameras is the spring-wound cameras used in hazardous special effects, known as &quot;crash cams&quot;. Scenes shot with these have to be kept short or resynchronized manually with the sound. MOS cameras are also often used for second unit work or anything involving slow or fast-motion filming.

With the advent of digital cameras, synchronization became a redundant term, as both visual and audio is simultaneously captured electronically.

==Home movie cameras==

Movie cameras were available before World War II often using the 9.5 mm film format or 16 mm format. The use of movie cameras had an upsurge in popularity in the immediate post-war period giving rise to the creation of home movies. Compared to the pre-war models, these cameras were small, light, fairly sophisticated and affordable.

An extremely compact 35 mm movie camera &quot;Kinamo&quot; was designed by Emanuel Goldberg for amateur and semi-professional movies in 1921. A spring motor attachment was added in 1923 to allow flexible handheld filming. The Kinamo was used by Joris Ivens and other avant-garde and documentary filmmakers in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

While a basic model might have a single fixed aperture/focus lens, a better version might have three or four lenses of differing apertures and focal lengths on a rotating turret. A good quality camera might come with a variety of interchangeable, focusable lenses or possibly a single zoom lens. The viewfinder was normally a parallel sight within or on top of the camera body. In the 1950s and for much of the 1960s these cameras were powered by clockwork motors, again with variations of quality. A simple mechanism might only power the camera for some 30 seconds, while a geared drive camera might work for as long as 75 – 90 seconds (at standard speeds).

The common film used for these cameras was termed Standard 8, which was a strip of 16-millimetre wide film which was only exposed down one half during shooting. The film had twice the number of perforations as film for 16 mm cameras and so the frames were half as high and half as wide as 16 mm frames. The film was removed and placed back in the camera to expose the frames on the other side once the first half had been exposed. Once the film was developed it was sliced down the middle and the ends attached, giving of Standard 8 film from a spool of of 16 mm film. 16 mm cameras, mechanically similar to the smaller format models, were also used in home movie making but were more usually the tools of semi professional film and news film makers.

In the 1960s a new film format, Super8, coincided with the advent of battery-operated electric movie cameras. The new film, with a larger frame print on the same width of film stock, came in a cassette that simplified changeover and developing. Another advantage of the new system is that they had the capacity to record sound, albeit of indifferent quality. Camera bodies, and sometimes lenses, were increasingly made in plastic rather than the metals of the earlier types. As the costs of mass production came down, so did the price and these cameras became very popular.

This type of format and camera was more quickly superseded for amateurs by the advent of digital video cameras in the 2000s. Since the 2010s, amateurs increasingly started preferring smartphone cameras.

<doc id="199548" wikidata="Q134870" url="?curid=199548" title="Panarthropoda">
<text>Panarthropoda is a proposed animal clade containing the extant phyla Arthropoda, Tardigrada (water bears) and Onychophora (velvet worms). Panarthropods also include extinct marine legged worms known as lobopodians (&quot;Lobopodia&quot;), a paraphyletic group where the last common ancestor and basal members (stem-group) of each extant panarthropod phylum are thought to have risen. However the term &quot;Lobopodia&quot; is sometimes expanded to include tardigrades and onychophorans as well.

Common characteristics of the Panarthropoda include a segmented body, paired ladder-like ventral nervous system, and the presence of paired appendages correlated with body segments.

== Taxonomy ==
Not all studies support the monophyly of Panarthropoda, but most do, including neuroanatomical, phylogenomic and palaeontological studies. At least a close relationship between onychophorans and arthropods is widely agreed upon, but the position of tardigrades is more controversial. Some phylogenomic studies have found tardigrades to be more closely related to nematodes. Traditionally, panarthropods were considered to be closely related to the annelids, grouped together as the Articulata (animals with body segments), but subsequent phylogenomic studies consistently place them closer to cycloneuralians (nematodes, nematomorphs, loriciferans, kinorhynchas and priapulids), grouped together as Ecdysozoa. While annelids are placed among the Spiralia (making them more closely related to mollusks, flatworms and such), having evolved their segmented bodies convergently.

=== Interrelationships ===

There are three competing hyphotheses for the interrelationship between the extant panarthropod phyla, each known as Tactopoda (Arthropoda+Tardigrada), Antennopoda (Arthropoda+Onychophora), and the sister relationship between Onychophora and Tardigrada (Lobopodia &quot;sensu&quot; Smith &amp; Goldstein 2017).



Tactopoda had been supported by mitochondrial gene arrangements, palaeontological and neuroanatomical evidences, specifically the presence of segmented ganglia shared by arthropods and tardigrades. Antennopodia united by the presence of specialized head appendages and deutocerebrum (additional second section of the brain), but subsequent anatomical studies suggest these features were convergently evolved between onychophoran and arthropod lineages. Onychophorans and tardigrades shared some lobopodian traits (e.g. soft cuticle, lobopodous appendages and peripheral nerve roots), but these were generally considered to be plesiomorphies traced back to the last common ancestor of Panarthropoda or Ecdysozoa. While most phylogenomic analyses support the monophyly of Panarthropoda, the results of interrelationship between the three phyla are less correlated - some of them inconsistently placing Tardigrada within Arthropoda, while the others mostly recovering either Antennopoda or Onychophora+Tardigrada.

The &quot;Lobopodia&quot; are paraphyletic; they include the last common ancestor of arthropods, onychophorans and tardigrades.

&quot;Sialomorpha&quot;, a genus of microinvertebrate discovered in Dominican amber in 2019, is also considered to be a panarthropod. However, due to the unusual combination of tardigrade and mite-like characteristics, its exact placement is uncertain.

<doc id="199550" wikidata="Q1248773" url="?curid=199550" title="Jude the Obscure">
<text>Jude the Obscure is a novel by Thomas Hardy, which began as a magazine serial in December 1894 and was first published in book form in 1895 (though the title page says 1896). It is Hardy&#x27;s last completed novel. The protagonist, Jude Fawley, is a working-class young man; he is a stonemason who dreams of becoming a scholar. The other main character is his cousin, Sue Bridehead, who is also his central love interest. The novel is concerned in particular with issues of class, education, religion, morality and marriage. It was Hardy&#x27;s fourteenth and last published novel.

==Plot summary==
The novel tells the story of Jude Fawley, who lives in a village in southern England (part of Hardy&#x27;s fictional county of Wessex). He yearns to be a scholar at &quot;Christminster&quot;, a city modelled on Oxford. As a youth, Jude teaches himself Classical Greek and Latin in his spare time, while working first in his great-aunt&#x27;s bakery, with the hope of entering university. But before he can try to do this the naïve Jude is seduced by Arabella Donn, a rather coarse, morally lax, and superficial local girl who traps him into marriage by pretending to be pregnant. The marriage is a failure, and Arabella leaves Jude and later emigrates to Australia, where she enters into a bigamous marriage. By this time, Jude has abandoned his classical studies.

After Arabella leaves him, Jude moves to Christminster and supports himself as a mason while studying alone, hoping to be able to enter the university later. There, he meets and falls in love with his free-spirited cousin, Sue Bridehead. But, shortly after this, Jude introduces Sue to his former school teacher, Mr. Phillotson, whom she eventually is persuaded to marry, despite the fact that he is some twenty years her senior. She soon regrets this, because, in addition to being in love with Jude, she is horrified by the notion of sex with her husband. Sue soon asks Phillotson for permission to leave him for Jude, which he grants, once he realizes how unwilling she is to fulfill what he believes are her marital duties to him. Because of this scandal—the fact that Phillotson willingly allows his wife to leave for another man—Phillotson has to give up his career as a schoolmaster.
Sue and Jude spend some time living together without any sexual relationship. This is because of Sue&#x27;s dislike both of sex and the institution of marriage. Soon after, Arabella reappears having fled her Australian husband, who managed a hotel in Sydney, and this complicates matters. Arabella and Jude divorce and she legally marries her bigamous husband, and Sue also is divorced. However, following this, Arabella reveals that she had a child of Jude&#x27;s, eight months after they separated, and subsequently sends this child to his father. He is named Jude and nicknamed &quot;Little Father Time&quot; because of his intense seriousness and lack of humor.

Jude eventually convinces Sue to sleep with him and, over the years, they have two children together and expect a third. But Jude and Sue are socially ostracised for living together unmarried, especially after the children are born. Jude&#x27;s employers dismiss him because of the illicit relationship, and the family is forced into a nomadic lifestyle, moving from town to town across Wessex seeking employment and housing before eventually returning to Christminster. Their socially troubled boy, &quot;Little Father Time&quot;, comes to believe that he and his half-siblings are the source of the family&#x27;s woes. The morning after their arrival in Christminster, he kills Sue&#x27;s two children and himself by hanging. He leaves behind a note that simply reads, &quot;Done because we are too menny [&quot;sic&quot;].&quot; Shortly thereafter, Sue has a miscarriage.

Overwhelmed with grief and blaming herself for &quot;Little Father Time&quot;&#x27;s actions, Sue turns to the church, against which she has rebelled. She comes to believe that the children&#x27;s deaths were divine retribution for her relationship with Jude. Although horrified at the thought of resuming her marriage with Phillotson, she becomes convinced that, for religious reasons, she should never have left him. Arabella discovers Sue&#x27;s feelings and informs Phillotson, who soon proposes they remarry. This results in Sue leaving Jude once again for Phillotson, and she punishes herself by allowing her husband sex. Jude is devastated and remarries Arabella, whose husband has died, after she plies him with alcohol to once again trick him into marriage.

After one final, desperate visit to Sue in freezing weather, Jude becomes seriously ill and dies within the year in Christminster, thwarted in his ambitions both in love and in achieving fame in scholarship. It is revealed that Sue has grown &quot;staid and worn&quot; with Phillotson. Arabella does not mourn Jude&#x27;s passing, instead setting the stage to ensnare her next husband.

==Themes==
The novel explores several social problems in Victorian England, especially those relating to the institutions of marriage, the Church, and education. These themes are developed in particular through Hardy&#x27;s use of contrast. For example, at the beginning of their relationship, Jude&#x27;s Christian faith contrasts with Sue&#x27;s religious scepticism, a contrast which is heightened even further by their later role-reversal. Although the central characters represent both perspectives, the novel as a whole is firmly critical of Christianity and social institutions in general.

Jude&#x27;s trajectory through the story sheds light on the ambivalent and conflicting roles of organized religion in his life. Jude, from his origins in Marygreen, always found religion to be the endgame of an otherwise troublesome and uninteresting life. But, as seen through his systematic exclusion from the University of Christminster, Jude&#x27;s dream of entering the church would prove to be unattainable, leaving him to pursue other, less fulfilling interests. A similar track can be seen in Hardy&#x27;s treatment of the traditional institution of marriage. From the original pairing of Arabella and Jude to their eventual reunion, Hardy depicts marriage as an oppressive social necessity, propelling the characters into a downward spiral of unhappiness.

Although Hardy claimed that &quot;no book he had ever written contained less of his own life&quot;, contemporary reviewers found several parallels between the themes of the novel and Hardy&#x27;s life as a working-class man of letters. The unhappy marriages, the religious and philosophical questioning, and the social problems dealt with in &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; appear in many other Hardy novels, as well as in Hardy&#x27;s life. The struggle against fixed class boundaries is an important link between the novel and Hardy&#x27;s life, especially concerning higher education and the working class. Although Jude wishes to attend the university at Christminster, he cannot afford the costs involved in studying for a degree, and he lacks the rigorous training necessary to qualify for a fellowship. He is therefore prevented from gaining economic mobility and getting out of the working class. This theme of unattainable education was personal for Hardy since he, like Jude, had been unable to afford to study for a degree at Oxford or Cambridge, in spite of his early interest in scholarship and the classics. Several specific details about Jude&#x27;s self-directed studies actually appear in Hardy&#x27;s autobiography, including late-night Latin readings while working full-time as a stonemason and then as an architect. However, unlike Jude&#x27;s relatives, Hardy&#x27;s mother was well-read, and she educated Thomas until he went to his first school at Bockhampton at the age of eight, and he attended school in Dorchester, where he learned Latin and demonstrated academic potential, until he became an apprentice at 16.

Another parallel between the book&#x27;s characters and themes and Hardy&#x27;s actual life experience occurs when Sue becomes obsessed with religion after previously having been indifferent and even hostile towards it. Like Sue Bridehead, Hardy&#x27;s first wife, Emma, went from being free-spirited and fairly indifferent to religion in her youth to becoming obsessively religious as she got older. Since Hardy was always highly critical of organised religion, as Emma became more and more religious, their differing views led to a great deal of tension in their marriage, and this tension was a major factor leading to their increased alienation from one another.

Emma Hardy was also very disapproving of &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;, in part because of the book&#x27;s criticisms of religion, but also because she worried that the reading public would believe that the relationship between Jude and Sue directly paralleled her strained relationship with Hardy (which, in a figurative sense, it did).

==Writing==
Around 1887, Hardy began making notes for a story about a working man&#x27;s frustrated attempts to attend the university, perhaps inspired in part by the scholastic failure and suicide of his friend Horace Moule. From December 1894 to November 1895, a bowdlerised version of the novel ran in instalments in &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot;, originally under the title &quot;The Simpletons&quot;, then &quot;Hearts Insurgent&quot;. In 1895, the book was published in London under its present title, &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; (dated 1896). In his Preface to the first edition, Hardy provides details of the conception and writing history of the novel, claiming that certain details were inspired by the death of a woman (most likely his cousin, Tryphena Sparks) in 1890.

==Reviews==
Called &quot;Jude the Obscene&quot; by at least one reviewer, &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; received a harsh reception from some scandalized critics. Among the critics was Walsham How, Bishop of Wakefield; Hardy later claimed that the bishop had burned a copy. It has been suggested that negative criticism was the reason that Hardy stopped writing novels after &quot;Jude&quot;, but poet C. H. Sisson describes this &quot;hypothesis&quot; as &quot;superficial and absurd&quot;.

The novel is No. 23 on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The 100 greatest British novels&quot; and No. 20 on The Guardian&#x27;s &quot;The 100 best novels written in English&quot;

D. H. Lawrence, an admirer of Hardy, was puzzled by the character of Sue Bridehead, and attempted to analyse her conflicted sexuality in his &quot;A Study of Thomas Hardy&quot; (1914).

At least one recent scholar has postulated that &quot;Jude&quot; borrowed heavily from an earlier novel, &quot;The Wages of Sin&quot; by Lucas Malet.

Marxist critic Terry Eagleton, in his introduction to a 1974 edition of the text, refutes the conventional reading of the novel as &quot;the tragedy of an oversexed peasant boy&quot;, instead examining the social background of the text and proposing it as a conflict between ideal and reality.

==Adaptations==
The novel has been adapted into:

* A six-part television serial, &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; (1971), directed by Hugh David, starring Robert Powell and Fiona Walker
* A feature film, &quot;Jude&quot; (1996), directed by Michael Winterbottom, starring Christopher Eccleston and Kate Winslet
* A two-part musical stage adaptation of &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; by Ian Finley (book), Bruce Benedict (music), Jonathan Fitts (music), and Jerome Davis (lyrics), premiered at Burning Coal Theatre Company in Raleigh, NC in April 2012
* The British playwright Howard Brenton wrote an updated adaptation of the novel, simply titled &quot;Jude&quot;, which premiered at The Hampstead Theatre in North London in May 2019. In this version, Jude is a free-spirited female Syrian refugee who works as a cleaner, her cousin is a male relative who becomes a radical Muslim, and she is regularly visited by a figure representing the Greek poet Euripides.
* The BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Hardy&#x27;s Women&quot; (2020) featured a three-part adaptation of &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;.

<text>In biology, a taxon (back-formation from &quot;taxonomy&quot;; : taxa) is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is very common, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion, especially in the context of rank-based (&quot;Linnaean&quot;) nomenclature (much less so under phylogenetic nomenclature). If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping.

Initial attempts at classifying and ordering organisms (plants and animals) were presumably set forth in prehistoric times by hunter-gatherers, as suggested by the fairly sophisticated folk taxonomies. Much later, Aristotle, and later still, European scientists, like Magnol, Tournefort and Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s system in &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, 10th edition (1758), as well as an unpublished work by Bernard and Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, contributed to this field. The idea of a unit-based system of biological classification was first made widely available in 1805 in the introduction of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck&#x27;s &quot;Flore françoise&quot;, and Augustin Pyramus de Candolle&#x27;s &quot;Principes élémentaires de botanique&quot;. Lamarck set out a system for the &quot;natural classification&quot; of plants. Since then, systematists continue to construct accurate classifications encompassing the diversity of life; today, a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;useful&quot; taxon is commonly taken to be one that reflects evolutionary relationships.

Many modern systematists, such as advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature, use cladistic methods that require taxa to be monophyletic (all descendants of some ancestor). Therefore, their basic unit, the clade, is equivalent to the taxon, assuming that taxa should reflect evolutionary relationships. Similarly, among those contemporary taxonomists working with the traditional Linnean (binomial) nomenclature, few propose taxa they know to be paraphyletic. An example of a long-established taxon that is not also a clade is the class Reptilia, the reptiles; birds and mammals are the descendants of animals traditionally classed as reptiles, but neither is included in the Reptilia (birds are traditionally placed in the class Aves, and mammals in the class Mammalia).

== History ==
The term &quot;taxon&quot; was first used in 1926 by Adolf Meyer-Abich for animal groups, as a back-formation from the word &quot;taxonomy&quot;; the word &quot;taxonomy&quot; had been coined a century before from the Greek components (), meaning &quot;arrangement&quot;, and (), meaning &quot;method&quot;. For plants, it was proposed by Herman Johannes Lam in 1948, and it was adopted at the VII International Botanical Congress, held in 1950.

== Definition ==
The glossary of the &quot;International Code of Zoological Nomenclature&quot; (1999) defines a
*&quot;taxon, (pl. taxa), n.

::A taxonomic unit, whether named or not: i.e. a population, or group of populations of organisms which are usually inferred to be phylogenetically related and which have characters in common which differentiate (q.v.) the unit (e.g. a geographic population, a genus, a family, an order) from other such units. A taxon encompasses all included taxa of lower rank (q.v.) and individual organisms. [...]&quot;

== Ranks ==

A taxon can be assigned a taxonomic rank, usually (but not necessarily) when it is given a formal name.

&quot;Phylum&quot; applies formally to any biological domain, but traditionally it was always used for animals, whereas &quot;division&quot; was traditionally often used for plants, fungi, etc.

A prefix is used to indicate a ranking of lesser importance. The prefix &quot;super-&quot; indicates a rank above, the prefix &quot;sub-&quot; indicates a rank below. In zoology, the prefix &quot;infra-&quot; indicates a rank below &quot;sub-&quot;. For instance, among the additional ranks of class are superclass, subclass and infraclass.

Rank is relative, and restricted to a particular systematic schema. For example, liverworts have been grouped, in various systems of classification, as a family, order, class, or division (phylum). The use of a narrow set of ranks is challenged by users of cladistics; for example, the mere 10 ranks traditionally used between animal families (governed by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN)) and animal phyla (usually the highest relevant rank in taxonomic work) often cannot adequately represent the evolutionary history as more about a lineage&#x27;s phylogeny becomes known.

In addition, the class rank is quite often not an evolutionary but a phenetic or paraphyletic group and as opposed to those ranks governed by the ICZN (family-level, genus-level and species-level taxa), can usually not be made monophyletic by exchanging the taxa contained therein. This has given rise to phylogenetic taxonomy and the ongoing development of the &quot;PhyloCode&quot;, which has been proposed as a new alternative to replace Linnean classification and govern the application of names to clades. Many cladists do not see any need to depart from traditional nomenclature as governed by the ICZN, International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, etc.

<doc id="199558" wikidata="Q539021" url="?curid=199558" title="John Abizaid">
<text>John Philip Abizaid (born 1 April 1951) is a retired United States Army general and former United States Central Command (CENTCOM) commander who served as the United States Ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 2019 to 2021.

In 2007, Abizaid retired after 34 years of service. As of 2007, Abizaid is employed as a fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. He assumed the Distinguished Chair of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point in December 2007. Abizaid was appointed to the board of directors of RPM International on 24 January 2008, and also sits on the board of directors of the Defense Ventures Group. In 2008, he was selected as a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.

On 13 November 2018, he was nominated as the United States Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. He was confirmed by the United States Senate as ambassador on 10 April 2019, and sworn in on 30 April 2019. Abizaid formally presented his credentials to King Salman on 16 June 2019. He resigned on 20 January 2021. He now serves as senior advisor at Albright Stonebridge Group.

==Early life and education==
Abizaid was born in Redwood City, California, to a family of Lebanese Roman Catholic Christians; his grandparents had immigrated from Lebanon in the 19th century. He was raised in Coleville, California, where he graduated from high school in 1969. His father, who served in the United States Navy as a machinist during World War II, raised him after Abizaid&#x27;s mother died of cancer.

Abizaid&#x27;s military education includes the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York (Class of 1973); Infantry Officer Basic and Advanced courses, Armed Forces Staff College, and a U.S. Army War College Senior Fellowship at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.

In his civilian studies, he earned a Master of Arts degree in Middle Eastern studies at Harvard University, and was an Olmsted Scholar at the University of Jordan in Amman, Jordan. Abizaid greatly impressed his teachers at Harvard University. Nadav Safran, the director of the Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies kept Abizaid&#x27;s 100-page paper on defense policy for Saudi Arabia, the only paper of a master&#x27;s student he has kept, saying, &quot;It was absolutely the best seminar paper I ever got in my 30-plus years at Harvard.&quot;

==Career==


Abizaid was commissioned a second lieutenant of infantry upon graduation from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, Class of June 1973. He started his career with the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he served as a rifle and scout platoon leader. He commanded companies in the 2nd and 1st Ranger Battalions, leading a Ranger Rifle Company during the invasion of Grenada. In 1983, he jumped from an MC-130 onto a landing strip in Grenada and ordered one of his Rangers to drive a bulldozer like a tank toward Cuban troops as he advanced behind it—a move highlighted in the 1986 Clint Eastwood film, &quot;Heartbreak Ridge&quot;.

Abizaid commanded the 3rd Battalion, 325th Airborne Regiment combat Team in Vicenza, Italy, during the Persian Gulf War and deployed with the battalion in Northern Iraq to provide a safe haven for the Kurds.

His brigade command was the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division. He served as the Assistant Division Commander, 1st Armored Division, in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Following that tour, he served as the 66th Commandant at the United States Military Academy at West Point. At West Point, he reined in hazing rituals and revamped the curriculum. Later, he took command of the 1st Infantry Division, the &quot;Big Red One,&quot; in Würzburg, Germany, from David L. Grange, which provided the first U.S. ground forces into Kosovo. He served as the Deputy Commander (Forward), Combined Forces Command, U.S. Central Command during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Staff assignments include a tour with the United Nations as Operations Officer (G-3) for Observer Group Lebanon and a tour in the Office of the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. European staff tours include assignments in both the Southern European Task Force and Headquarters, U.S. Army Europe. Abizaid also served as Executive Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Director of Strategic Plans and Policy (J-5) on the Joint Staff and Director of the Joint Staff.

Following the Iraq War and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Abizaid assumed command of Central Command from General Tommy Franks. He was under consideration to become the chief of staff of the Army in 2003, but declined the appointment.

On 20 December 2006, it was announced that Abizaid would step down from his position and retire in March 2007. He had planned to retire earlier, but stayed at the urging of Donald Rumsfeld. On 16 March 2007, Abizaid transferred command to Admiral William J. Fallon, after serving longer as commander of U.S. Central Command than any of his predecessors.

On 8 September 2016, Abizaid was appointed advisor to Ukrainian Defense Minister Stepan Poltorak by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.

On 13 November 2018, he was nominated as the U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. He was confirmed by the United States Senate as ambassador on 10 April 2019, and sworn in on 30 April 2019. Abizaid formally presented his credentials to King Salman on 16 June 2019.

==Personal life==
Abizaid is married and has three children, including Christine Abizaid. He learned Arabic in the military.

===Global War on Terrorism speech===
In November 2005, Abizaid gave a speech on the Global War on Terrorism at the Naval War College.

===2006–2007 comments on Iraq===

On 3 August 2006, Abizaid, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the following about the situation on the ground in Iraq: &quot;I believe that the sectarian violence is probably as bad as I&#x27;ve seen it, in Baghdad in particular, and that if not stopped, it is possible that Iraq could move towards civil war.&quot; He also testified, &quot;I&#x27;m optimistic that that slide [toward civil war] can be prevented&quot;.

===Bob Woodward on Abizaid and Murtha===

In &quot;State of Denial: Bush at War, Part III&quot; (as excerpted in &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine), Bob Woodward of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that on 16 March 2006, Abizaid was in Washington to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee. &quot;He painted a careful but upbeat picture of the situation in Iraq.&quot; Subsequently, &quot;he went over to see Congressman John Murtha (D-Pa), the 73-year old veteran Marine who had introduced a resolution the previous November calling for the redeployment of troops from Iraq as soon as practicable.&quot; Abizaid said he wanted to speak frankly, and &quot;according to Murtha, Abizaid raised his hand for emphasis and held his thumb and forefinger a quarter of an inch from each other and said, &quot;We&#x27;re that far apart.&quot;

On 1 October 2006, an interview of Woodward by CBS reporter Mike Wallace was broadcast on the television show &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. Wallace mentioned the Murtha-Abizaid conversation. Wallace asked Woodward to confirm that Murtha had told him of this tale of meeting with Abizaid; Woodward nodded his head in assent and said yes.

===Iran&#x27;s nuclear program===
In remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported on 17 September 2007, Abizaid stated, &quot;We need to press the international community as hard as we possibly can, and the Iranians, to cease and desist on the development of a nuclear weapon and we should not preclude any option that we may have to deal with it.&quot; He also said, &quot;I believe that we have the power to deter Iran, should it become nuclear.&quot;

&quot;There are ways to live with a nuclear Iran,&quot; Abizaid said, &quot;Let&#x27;s face it, we lived with a nuclear Soviet Union, we&#x27;ve lived with a nuclear China, and we&#x27;re living with (other) nuclear powers as well.&quot;

==Awards and decorations==
Abizaid has been decorated for service, to include:


===International decorations===
* Honorary Officer of the Order of Australia
* Gold Cross of Honour of the Bundeswehr (&quot;Ehrenkreuz der Bundeswehr in Gold&quot;)

<doc id="199559" wikidata="Q2562598" url="?curid=199559" title="Haemophilia B">
<text>Haemophilia B, also spelled hemophilia B, is a blood clotting disorder causing easy bruising and bleeding due to an inherited mutation of the gene for factor IX, and resulting in a deficiency of factor IX. It is less common than factor VIII deficiency (haemophilia A).

Haemophilia B was first recognized as a distinct disease entity in 1952. It is also known by the eponym &quot;Christmas disease&quot;, named after Stephen Christmas, the first patient described with haemophilia B. In addition, the first report of its identification was published in the Christmas edition of the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;.

Most individuals who have Hemophilia B and experience symptoms are men. The prevalence of Hemophilia B in the population is about one in 40,000; Hemophilia B represents about 15% of patients with hemophilia. Many female carriers of the disease have no symptoms. However, an estimated 10-25% of female carriers have mild symptoms; in rare cases, female carriers may have moderate or severe symptoms.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms include easy bruising, urinary tract bleeding (haematuria), nosebleeds (epistaxis), and bleeding into joints (haemarthrosis).

===Complications===
Patients with bleeding disorders show a higher incidence of periodontal disease as well as dental caries, concerning the fear of bleeding which leads to a lack of oral hygiene and oral health care. The most prominent oral manifestation of a mild haemophilia B would be gingival bleeding during exfoliation of primary dentition, or prolonged bleeding after an invasive procedure/tooth extraction; In severe haemophilia, there may be spontaneous bleeding from the oral tissues (e.g. soft palate, tongue, buccal mucosa), lips and gingiva, with ecchymoses. In rare cases, haemarthrosis (bleeding into joint space) of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) may be observed.

Patients with haemophilia will experience many episodes of oral bleeding over their lifetime. Average 29.1 bleeding events per year are serious enough to require factor replacement in F VIII-deficient patients which 9% involved oral structures. Children with severe haemophilia have significant lower prevalence of dental caries and lower plaque scores compared with matched, healthy controls.

==Genetics==

The factor IX gene is located on the X chromosome (Xq27.1-q27.2). It is an X-linked recessive trait, which explains why males are affected in greater numbers. A change in the F9 gene, which makes blood clotting factor IX (9), causes haemophilia B.

In 1990, George Brownlee and Merlin Crossley showed that two sets of genetic mutations were preventing two key proteins from attaching to the DNA of people with a rare and unusual form of haemophilia B – &quot;haemophilia B Leyden&quot; – where patients experience episodes of excessive bleeding in childhood but have few bleeding problems after puberty.

This lack of protein attachment to the DNA was thereby turning off the gene that produces clotting factor IX, which prevents excessive bleeding.

In about one third of people born with haemophilia, there is no history of the disorder in the family. This happens when a genetic change in the F8 or F9 gene occurs randomly during reproduction and is passed on at conception. And once haemophilia appears in a family the genetic change is then passed on from parents to children following the usual pattern for haemophilia.

==Pathophysiology==
Factor IX deficiency leads to an increased propensity for haemorrhage, which can be either spontaneously or in response to mild trauma.

Factor IX deficiency can cause interference of the coagulation cascade, thereby causing spontaneous haemorrhage when there is trauma. Factor IX when activated activates factor X which helps fibrinogen to fibrin conversion.

Factor IX becomes active eventually in coagulation by cofactor factor VIII (specifically IXa). Platelets provide a binding site for both cofactors. This complex (in the coagulation pathway) will eventually activate factor X.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis for haemophilia B can be done via the following tests/methods:
* Coagulation screening test
* Bleeding scores
* Coagulation factor assays

===Differential diagnosis===
The differential diagnosis for this inherited condition is the following: haemophilia A, factor XI deficiency, von Willebrand disease, fibrinogen disorders and Bernard–Soulier syndrome

==Treatment==
Treatment is given intermittently, when there is significant bleeding. It includes intravenous infusion of factor IX and/or blood transfusions. NSAIDS should be avoided once the diagnosis is made since they can exacerbate a bleeding episode. Any surgical procedure should be done with concomitant tranexamic acid.

Etranacogene dezaparvovec (Hemgenix) was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2022. It is the first gene therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat Hemophilia B.

=== Dental considerations ===
Surgical treatment, including a simple dental extraction, must be planned to minimize the risk of bleeding, excessive bruising, or haematoma formation. Soft vacuum-formed splints can be used to provide local protection following a dental extraction or prolonged post-extraction bleed.

== Research ==
In July 2022 results of a gene therapy candidate for haemophilia B called FLT180 were announced, it works using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) to restore the clotting factor IX (FIX) protein, normal levels of the protein were observed with low doses of the therapy but immunosuppression was necessitated to decrease the risk of vector-related immune responses.

A group of products called hemostasis rebalancing agents, that alter the balance of hemostasis, is currently undergoing a study. The alteration of hemostasis would affect individuals with defective hemostasis (which could cause haemophilia B), have a normal hemostatic response.

Additional studies of gene therapy products and approaches are under way in preclinical studies and later-phase clinical trials.

== History ==

Stephen Christmas (12 February 1947 – 20 December 1993) was the first patient described to have Christmas disease (or Haemophilia B) in 1952 by a group of British doctors. Christmas was born to a British family in London. He was the son of film and television actor Eric Christmas. He emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with his family, and was there at the age of two years that hemophilia was diagnosed at the Hospital for Sick Children. The family returned to London in 1952 to visit their relatives, and during the trip Stephen was admitted to hospital. A sample of his blood was sent to the Oxford Haemophilia Centre in Oxford, where Rosemary Biggs and Robert Gwyn Macfarlane discovered that he was not deficient in Factor VIII, which is normally decreased in classic hemophilia, but a different protein, which received the name Christmas factor in his honour (and later Factor IX). Stephen was dependent on blood and plasma transfusions, and was infected with HIV in the period during which blood was not routinely screened for this virus. He became an active worker for the Canadian Hemophilia Society and campaigned for transfusion safety ever since getting infected, but developed AIDS and died from it in 1993.

In the 1950s and 1960s, with newfound technology and gradual advances in medicine, pharmaceutical scientists found a way to take the factor IX from fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and give it to those with haemophilia B. Though they found a way to treat the disease, the FFP contained only a small amount of factor IX, requiring large amounts of FFP to treat an actual bleeding episode, which resulted in the person requiring hospitalization. By the mid-1960s scientists found a way to get a larger amount of factor IX from FFP. By the late 1960s, pharmaceutical scientists found methods to separate the factor IX from plasma, which allows for neatly packaged bottles of factor IX concentrates. With the rise of factor IX concentrates it became easier for people to get treatment at home. Although these advances in medicine had a significant positive impact on the treatment of haemophilia, there were many complications that came with it. By the early 1980s, scientists discovered that the medicines they had created were transferring blood-borne viruses, such as hepatitis, and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. With the rise of these deadly viruses, scientists had to find improved methods for screening the blood products they received from donors. In 1982, scientists made a breakthrough in medicine and were able to clone factor IX gene. With this new development it decreased the risk of the many viruses. Although the new factor was created, it was not available for haemophilia B patients until 1997.

In 2009, an analysis of genetic markers revealed that haemophilia B was the blood disease affecting many European royal families of the United Kingdom, Germany, Russia and Spain: so-called &quot;Royal Disease&quot;.

== Society and culture ==
Haemophilia B became known as &quot;Royal Disease&quot; due to its presence in European families. Queen Victoria was a carrier of haemophilia B who later passed these onto other ruling families from Russia, Spain and Germany.

<text>Ink is a ghost town in Shannon County, Missouri, United States. It is located at the intersection of Missouri Route N and county road 328. It is located on the north side of Spring Valley Creek just south of the Sunklands Conservation Area.

==History==
A post office called Ink was established in 1885, and remained in operation until 1954. According to folklorist Margot Ford McMillen, the unusual name of the village came about literally by accident. After several attempts at a name were rejected, a community meeting was held. Wanting a name short and memorable, a children&#x27;s spelling book with three-letter words such as cat, bat, dog, and the like was consulted. The meeting grew lengthy, and finally, someone accidentally spilled an ink well onto the book and table. Another citizen suggested, &quot;why not call the town Ink?&quot; The U.S. postal authorities found it acceptable, thus the village was officially so named. In spite of the tradition, Ink may have been named simply on account of the name&#x27;s brevity.

<text>Esther Zaied, better known by her married name Esther Ofarim (; born June 13, 1941), is an Israeli singer. She came second in the 1963 Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;T&#x27;en va pas&quot;, representing Switzerland. After marrying Abi Ofarim in 1958, she was half of the husband-and-wife folk duo Esther &amp; Abi Ofarim in the 1960s. After the couple divorced, she undertook a successful solo career.

==Life and career==

===Beginnings===
Esther Zaied was born in Safed to a Syrian Jewish family. She began performing as a child, singing Hebrew and international folk songs. In 1958, Esther met Abi Ofarim, a guitarist and dancer, who she later married. She was a student in his dance studio in Haifa. Esther served four months in the Israeli Army before she was discharged owing to her marriage to Abi.

American director Otto Preminger cast Esther for a small role in the film &quot;Exodus&quot; (1960). In 1960, Esther landed the role of Katzia in the play &quot;The Legend of Three and Four&quot; at the Habima Theatre. In 1961, she won first at Israel&#x27;s first pop song festival in Tel Aviv, where she sang &quot;Saëni Imchá Bemachol&quot; (Take Me with You When You Dance) and &quot;Naamah&quot;, written by Pnina and Tsvi Avni, accompanied by Kol Yisrael orchestra under Gary Bertini.

In 1962, Esther released her self-titled debut solo album and was invited to join Frank Sinatra in his performances in Israel. Kol Yisrael radio then sent her to the Sopot International Song Festival in Poland. She came in second place for singing &quot;Stav&quot;, written by Moshe Wilensky and Shimshon Halfi.

===Eurovision 1963===
Esther and Abi settled in Geneva, Switzerland, where she took part in the 1963 Eurovision Song Contest representing Switzerland with the song &quot;T&#x27;en va pas&quot;. In a very close and controversial competition with the Danish duo Grethe and Jørgen Ingmann, her song placed second. Initially it appeared Switzerland had won the contest with 42 points to Denmark&#x27;s 40, but after an apparent change to the Norwegian scores, Ofarim ended up with 40 points, as opposed to 42 points for &quot;Dansevise&quot;, a reversal of the initial result.

&quot;T&#x27;en va pas&quot; was released as single on Philips Records in 1963, reaching No. 39 in Germany.

In 1963, Esther had a starring role in the German film &quot;Es war mir ein Vergnügen&quot;.

===Esther &amp; Abi Ofarim===
In 1963 and 1964, Esther and Abi had success on the charts in Europe. In the fall of 1964, Esther embarked on a tour of the United States with the Smothers Brothers. Speaking about a performance at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon, Jim Albright, campus correspondent, stated: Everyone expected the Smother Brothers to be great, but Ester [&quot;sic&quot;] turned out to be fabulous...people were amazed with her singing and her looks.&quot;

By 1965, Esther was well known throughout Europe. She headlined in the major concert halls and theaters. She starred in German films and had her own television specials on BBC and Eurovision. 

In 1966, Abi and Ofarim had their first hit with &quot;Noch einen Tanz&quot;, an English version of which, &quot;One More Dance&quot;, was a hit in the UK two years later, peaking at No. 13. Their greatest success in Germany was in 1967 with &quot;Morning of My Life&quot;, which was written by the Bee Gees. In 1968 &quot;Cinderella Rockefella&quot; hit the top of the charts in a number of countries including the UK. They performed live concerts in New York City and London, and they toured Europe before separating in 1969.

===Solo career===
Esther began recording as a solo artist in the early 1960s. She often sang in different languages. In 1967, she recorded, Esther im Kinderland, in which she sang 20 children&#x27;s songs from eight countries in six different languages. After her divorce from Abi, she continued performing and released several albums.

On 25 February 1970, she co-starred in her own BBC television special &quot;The Young Generation Meet Esther Ofarim&quot; broadcast on BBC1. Later that year, she sang &quot;Long About Now&quot; on Scott Walker&#x27;s album &quot;&#x27;Til the Band Comes In.&quot;

In 1982, she released the album &quot;Complicated Ladies&quot; on Mercury Records with Eberhard Schoener, Wolf Wondratschek, and Ulf Miehe.

In 1984, she played in Joshua Sobol&#x27;s play &quot;Ghetto&quot;, produced by Peter Zadek in Berlin. There she sang songs including &quot;Frühling&quot; and &quot;Unter deinen weissen Sternen&quot;. Her songs were featured in the 2004 Israeli film, &quot;Walk on Water&quot;.

== Personal life ==
At the age of 17, Esther married Abi Ofarim on December 11, 1958. They separated in 1969, and their divorce was finalized in Germany in November 1970.

Esther later married assistant television director Philipp von Sell, who is 18 years her junior. They had a son, David von Sell, born in New York in 1983. Esther and Philipp divorced when David was nine. David is a musician, he attended Berklee College of Music in Boston.

== Accolades ==
In 1965, Esther won an Edison Award at the Grand Gala du Disque in Holland. One year later, she was voted Germany&#x27;s best female singer.

<doc id="199564" wikidata="Q178549" url="?curid=199564" title="Counting Crows">
<text>Counting Crows is an American rock band from the San Francisco Bay Area, California. Formed in 1991, the band consists of guitarist David Bryson, drummer Jim Bogios, vocalist Adam Duritz, keyboardist Charlie Gillingham, David Immerglück, bass guitarist Millard Powers, and guitarist Dan Vickrey. Past members include the drummers Steve Bowman (1991–1994) and Ben Mize (1994–2002), and bass guitarist Matt Malley (1991–2005).

Counting Crows gained popularity following the release of its first album, &quot;August and Everything After&quot; (1993). With the breakthrough hit single &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; (1993), the album sold more than 7 million copies in the United States. The band received two Grammy Awards nominations in 1994, one for &quot;Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal&quot; (for &quot;Round Here&quot;) and one for &quot;Best New Artist&quot;. The follow-up album, &quot;Recovering the Satellites&quot;, reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and reached number one in several other countries. All but one of their subsequent albums reached the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 list.

Their hit singles include the aforementioned &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; as well as &quot;Rain King&quot;, &quot;A Long December&quot;, &quot;Hanginaround&quot;, and a cover version of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;. Counting Crows received a 2004 Academy Award nomination for the single &quot;Accidentally in Love&quot;, which was included in the film &quot;Shrek 2&quot;. The band has sold more than 20 million albums and is known for its dynamic live performances. &quot;Billboard&quot; has also ranked the band as the 8th greatest Adult Alternative Artist of all time.

The band&#x27;s most recent full album, &quot;Somewhere Under Wonderland&quot;, was released in 2014. They released a four-song EP in 2021 titled &quot;Butter Miracle, Suite One&quot;, which is expected to be expanded to a full album.

== Origin of band name ==
The band name is derived from &quot;One for Sorrow&quot;, a British divination nursery rhyme about the superstitious counting of magpies, which are members of the crow family. Singer Adam Duritz heard the rhyme in the film &quot;Signs of Life&quot;, which starred his close friend, actress Mary-Louise Parker.

Here is one modern version of the rhyme:
The rhyme is featured in the song &quot;A Murder of One&quot; on the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;August and Everything After&quot;.

== History ==

=== 1990s ===

==== 1991–1992: Formation and early years ====
Adam Duritz, former member of the San Francisco Bay Area band the Himalayans, and producer/guitarist David Bryson formed Counting Crows in San Francisco in 1991. They began as an acoustic duo, playing gigs in and around Berkeley and San Francisco. Another friend, guitarist David Immerglück, played with them from time to time, though he was not an official member of the group, and experimented with other musicians in the area. As the emerging band recorded some demos, and as other musicians joined the duo to make a full band, Immerglück recorded with the band on some of the songs for its first album. He declined to join the band at the time, because of his membership in two other locally popular bands, Monks of Doom and Camper Van Beethoven. By 1993, the band had grown to a stable lineup of Duritz as vocalist, occasional pianist, and primary songwriter, Bryson on guitar, Matt Malley playing bass guitar, Charlie Gillingham on keyboards, and Steve Bowman as drummer, and the band was a regular in the Bay Area scene.

When Gary Gersh of Geffen Records heard the band&#x27;s demo tape, he was &quot;blown away&quot;. A bidding war between nine different record labels broke out in February 1992. In April, the band—which, by that time, included other members—&quot;signed a deal with Gersh and Geffen believed to be so lucrative that industry wags dubbed them Accounting Crows&quot;. On January 16, 1993, the band, still relatively unknown, filled in for Van Morrison at the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame ceremony, and was introduced by an enthusiastic Robbie Robertson. At the ceremony, they played a cover of Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Caravan&quot;.
Before signing to Geffen, the band recorded demo versions of a number of songs, known as the &#x27;Flying Demos&#x27;. These later surfaced among the Counting Crows fanbase. Tracks include &quot;Rain King&quot;, &quot;Omaha&quot;, &quot;Anna Begins&quot;, &quot;Einstein on the Beach (For an Eggman)&quot;, &quot;Shallow Days&quot;, &quot;Love and Addiction&quot;, &quot;Mr. Jones&quot;, &quot;Round Here&quot;, &quot;40 Years&quot;, &quot;Margery Dreams of Horses&quot;, &quot;Bulldog&quot;, &quot;Lightning&quot;, and &quot;We&#x27;re Only Love&quot;.

==== 1993–1994: &quot;August and Everything After&quot; and popular success ====

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;August and Everything After&quot;, was released in September 1993. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Mr. Jones&quot;, refers to Marty Jones (Himalayans bassist, and Duritz&#x27;s childhood friend) and Kenney Dale Johnson (the drummer of Silvertone, Chris Isaak&#x27;s band). It describes the desire of working musicians to make it big and the fantasies they entertain about what fame might bring. Duritz sang the song in fun, enjoying the fantasy; he did not realize that just months later, in December 1993, MTV would begin playing the video for the song. &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; was a breakthrough hit, drawing massive radio play and launching the band into stardom. In 2018, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described &quot;August and Everything After&quot; as follows: &quot;August And Everything After&quot; [launched] the Bay Area septet with its hippie-inspired, roots-rock-infiltrating hits &quot;Mr. Jones&quot;, &quot;Round Here&quot;, and &quot;Rain King&quot;, (ironically, at a time when grunge dominated the charts). Counting Crows eschewed the trend, happily wearing their time-stamped influences like Van Morrison and The Band on their patchwork sleeves, and found an audience who agreed with them. That first album went on to become a seven-times-platinum success in the U.S. alone, at the time the fastest-selling record since Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot;.

With &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; propelling the band forward, and with positive reviews from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and other publications, it was decided that the band could use a second guitarist, and Dan Vickrey, another Bay Area musician was offered the role as lead guitarist, singing backing vocals. The band toured extensively in 1993 and 1994, both as headliners and in supporting roles with other artists, including the Rolling Stones, Cracker, the Cranberries, Suede, Bob Dylan, Los Lobos, Jellyfish, and Midnight Oil. In 1994, the band appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. The album sold seven million copies in the U.S. The band received two Grammy nominations in 1994; one for Best Rock Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal (for &quot;Round Here&quot;) and one for Best New Artist.

Success took a toll on Counting Crows; Duritz suffered a widely reported nervous breakdown, which was not his first.

==== 1995–1998: &quot;Recovering the Satellites&quot; and double live album ====

The band played only two gigs in 1995. This allowed Duritz to write a set of songs that became the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Recovering the Satellites&quot;. Released October 15, 1996, it was heavier than &quot;August and Everything After&quot;. A response to the sudden fame that &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; had brought, it contains lyrics such as &quot;These days I feel like I&#x27;m fading away / Like sometimes when I hear myself on the radio&quot; (from &quot;Have You Seen Me Lately?&quot;) and &quot;Gonna get back to basics / Guess I&#x27;ll start it up again&quot; (from &quot;Recovering the Satellites&quot;). Dealing with the theme of Duritz&#x27;s unease with his newfound fame, the album was described as &quot;a concept album of sorts about trying to pick up the pieces of a family, a social life and a psyche shattered by fame&quot;. This album contained the single &quot;A Long December&quot;, which was a number one hit in Canada and a Top 10 hit in the United States.

On July 2, 1997, Counting Crows started off a co-headlining tour with the Wallflowers that continued to September. The tour included opening acts by Bettie Serveert, Engine 88, Gigolo Aunts and That Dog, with each opening band touring for three-weeks. After nine months of near-constant touring in support of the album, Duritz developed nodules on his vocal cords in July 1997, leading to the cancellation of a number of gigs. After taking time off to recover, the band toured for the rest of 1997, concluding with a MTV show at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City. This concert was released as half of a double live album, &quot;Across a Wire: Live in New York City&quot;. The other disc was a recording of a predominantly acoustic set from the band&#x27;s appearance on the &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot; show.

==== 1999–2001: &quot;This Desert Life&quot; and extensive touring ====
In 1999, Counting Crows performed at Woodstock 99. Later that same year, the band released &quot;This Desert Life&quot;, sales of which were propelled by the success of &quot;Hanginaround&quot; and &quot;Colorblind&quot;, which was also featured in the movie &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;. Supporting the album, the band embarked on a co-headlining tour with alternative rock band Live. Counting Crows closed nearly every show. Before this album and subsequent tour, the band invited session player and long-time friend David Immerglück to join the band as a permanent member. Immerglück had played on every Counting Crows album as a sideman, but early on had declined a permanent position. This time, however, Immerglück agreed. He plays a variety of instruments with the band, including acoustic, electric and pedal steel guitars, slide guitar and mandolin, as well as backing vocals.

=== 2000s ===
==== 2002–2003: &quot;Hard Candy&quot; and greatest hits album ====
On July 9, 2002, the band released its fourth studio album, &quot;Hard Candy&quot;. The album included a cover of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s song &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;. Vanessa Carlton contributed backing vocals to the single edit of the track, which appeared on the soundtrack for &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; and was re-released on future &quot;Hard Candy&quot; albums. The original version, without vocals by Carlton, appeared on the first album release as a hidden track. &quot;Hard Candy&quot; received better reviews than the previous efforts, with &quot;radio friendly&quot; songs, like &quot;American Girls&quot; (which featured Sheryl Crow on backing vocals), and contains a more upbeat feel and tempo. The band toured with the Dutch band, Bløf. A song, &quot;Holiday in Spain&quot;, came together as a result of the camaraderie between the two groups: it is sung partly as a dual language duet, and partly as a musical &quot;round&quot;, with both lead singers singing in differing languages at the end of the song.

Midway through the Hard Candy tour, drummer Ben Mize (born February 2, 1971, Durham, North Carolina) amicably left the band to spend more time with his family and pursue his own musical interests. After Mize completed the American leg of the tour, he was replaced by Jim Bogios, formerly a drummer with Ben Folds and Sheryl Crow. Jim attributes leaving Sheryl Crow for Counting Crows to becoming a band member and having more creative input. Following the Hard Candy tour, longtime bassist Matt Malley left the band after growing weary of touring, and to attend to his duties as a new father. He was replaced by Millard Powers.

Counting Crows released the greatest hits album &quot;Films About Ghosts&quot; in November 2003.

==== 2004–2006: Oscars and &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; ====
In 2004, the band&#x27;s &quot;Accidentally in Love&quot; song appeared on the soundtrack of the animated film &quot;Shrek 2&quot;. At the 77th Academy Awards, the song was nominated for Best Original Song, but lost to &quot;Al otro lado del río&quot; from &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot;.
In June 2006, the band released &quot;New Amsterdam: Live at Heineken Music Hall&quot; album.

==== 2007–2008: &quot;Saturday Nights &amp; Sunday Mornings&quot; ====
Duritz hinted in a 2006 interview that Counting Crows&#x27; next studio record would be released in late 2007. He indicated that the band had spent three weeks working in a recording studio with Gil Norton, the producer behind &quot;Recovering the Satellites&quot;, and revealed the working title of the album to be &quot;Saturday Nights &amp; Sunday Mornings&quot;. Duritz explained that, &quot;Saturday night is when you sin and Sunday is when you regret. Sinning is often done very loudly, angrily, bitterly, violently.&quot; Vickrey stated that &quot;the idea at the moment is to have kind of a rocking side and then an acoustic-y, maybe country-ish side. We got the first half done in May in New York, so half of it is pretty strong and done. And now we&#x27;re going to work on the second half, the country tunes, during the tour.&quot;

Amidst touring in the summer of 2007, the band performed live before the Home Run Derby at the 2007 MLB All-Star Game on July 9, 2007. On July 22 they previewed two new songs at Daniel S. Frawley Stadium in Wilmington, Delaware, a new ballad titled &quot;Washington Square&quot; and a hard rocking track called &quot;Cowboys&quot;. On August 8, 2007, VH1 filmed a live performance of &quot;Mr. Jones&quot;, clips of which were shown on the miniseries &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the 90s&quot;. The song ranked No. 27 on the list.

In September 2007, Counting Crows played a unique show at Town Hall in New York City, during which it performed all the tracks from &quot;August and Everything After&quot; in album order. The show was recorded for a planned DVD release, and also featured several songs from the new album. On September 27, Duritz announced on his blog that the band had asked its record label to postpone the album&#x27;s release until early 2008, citing the time pressures involved in preparing both the new album and an &quot;August and Everything After&quot; deluxe edition for release.

On January 16, 2008, the band released a digital single on its official website as a free download. It featured &quot;1492&quot; from the &quot;Saturday Nights&quot; half of the new album, and &quot;When I Dream Of Michelangelo&quot; from the &quot;Sunday Mornings&quot; half as its B-side. The album was released on March 25, 2008.

==== Departure from Geffen ====
On March 22, 2009, Duritz announced on the band&#x27;s website that they would be leaving Geffen Records, with whom they had worked for 18 years. He ended the post with a free download of the band&#x27;s cover of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Borderline&quot;, recorded live at the Royal Albert Hall in 2003.

Following the departure from Geffen, the band has continued to tour. During the summer of 2009, they launched the ambitious &quot;Saturday Night Rebel Rockers Traveling Circus and Medicine Show&quot; tour with longtime Bay Area friend Michael Franti, his band Spearhead, and the band Augustana. Instead of the traditional concert format of a short set by an opening act, followed by a longer set from a main supporting act, and then a long set by the headlining band, the shows featured members of all of the bands joining each other for songs from each bands&#x27; catalogs at various points throughout the evening. As Duritz explained in a welcoming message on the official website for the tour, each show &quot;is going to start with EVERYONE onstage together and we&#x27;re going to all be running on &amp; off stage all night playing one each other&#x27;s songs all together and basically just playing whenever we feel like playing.&quot;

=== 2010s ===
==== 2010–2013: Independent releases and individual projects ====
The album &quot;August and Everything After: Live at Town Hall&quot; was released on August 29, 2011. The release marked the band&#x27;s third professionally produced live album, and the first concert video of its career. The album used footage from the Town Hall concert, recorded in September 2007.

The band released a covers album entitled &quot;Underwater Sunshine (Or What We Did On Our Summer Vacation)&quot; on April 10, 2012, with a cover design by a fan chosen in a promotional contest. After touring extensively in 2012 and 2013 in support of the album (including headlining &quot;The Outlaw Roadshow&quot;, a traveling festival tour presented in conjunction with Ryan Spaulding of the music blog Ryan&#x27;s Smashing Life, and touring North America in the summer of 2013 with the Wallflowers), the band began working on material for a new album. Duritz also took time in the summer of 2012 to begin co-writing a play called &quot;Black Sun&quot;, which will also feature some music written by Duritz, including well-known rarity songs &quot;Good Luck&quot; and &quot;Chelsea&quot;.

A live album, &quot;Echoes of the Outlaw Roadshow&quot;, was released in North America in November 2013.

==== 2014–2019: &quot;Somewhere Under Wonderland&quot;, podcast and wine ====
The writing of material for a new album, &quot;Somewhere Under Wonderland&quot;, began early in 2013 and continued during that year&#x27;s summer tour. The album was released on September 2, 2014.

In 2018, Duritz became an investor in three wineries based in Napa Valley, California—Elyse Winery, Institution Winery, and Addax Winery—managed by winemaker Russell Bevan.

Starting in February 2018, Duritz began recording the Underwater Sunshine Podcast, a weekly music podcast with author and music journalist James Campion. Having parted ways with Spaulding, Duritz and friends began putting on their own twice-annual music festival in New York called the Underwater Sunshine Fest to showcase independent music. The first festival, held at the Bowery Electric in October 2018, featured 17 bands over two nights. A second in April 2019 showcased 18 bands, and a third held at Rockwood Music Hall in November 2019 expanded the lineup to 26. Acts as diverse as Yellow House Orchestra, Seán Barna, Mikaela Davis, Marcy Playground, Matt Sucich, Stephen Kellogg, Stew and the Negro Problem, and Fairhazel have appeared. More bands recorded acoustic sessions at Duritz&#x27;s loft the weekends of each of the festivals.

In January 2019, Counting Crows released a newly recorded version of &quot;August and Everything After&quot; performed with the London Symphony Orchestra at AIR Studios. The song was cut from the band&#x27;s first album, which had been named after it. Duritz then revealed in late 2019 that he had begun writing new music that past August.

===2020s===

==== 2020–present: &quot;Butter Miracle&quot;, cooking and more ====
In early February 2020, Duritz described the band&#x27;s next project as suites of music that may be released on various EPs. The band began studio sessions in late February and early March on four songs that complete the first suite: &quot;The Tall Grass&quot;, &quot;Elevator Boots&quot;, &quot;The Angel of 14th Street&quot;, and &quot;Bobby and the Rat Kings&quot;. Mott the Hoople, Thin Lizzy, and Seán Barna&#x27;s album &quot;CISSY&quot; were cited as influences on demos of the songs as Duritz was writing, though the final recordings would likely not sound similar.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, without touring, without being able to work on music in the studio, and taking a hiatus from his podcast, Duritz began hosting cooking videos through his Instagram stories. Speaking with chef Tyler Florence, Duritz said the type of research he would do regarding music for the podcast he turned into exploring more about food and cooking to share with others. Duritz and Campion would return to producing the Underwater Sunshine Podcast in May 2021.

&quot;Elevator Boots&quot; was released as the first single for the four-track EP in April 2021, described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;a melodic, wistful ode to life on tour, with a sound that somehow manages to bridge the gap between the Band and Mott the Hoople.&quot; The EP, titled &quot;Butter Miracle, Suite One&quot;, was released on May 21, 2021. 

At the time, Duritz told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that a second EP, &quot;Butter Miracle, Suite Two&quot;, would be released and together with the first form a full album. He was writing songs for the second EP, and the band planned to resume touring in the fall of 2021. In February 2022, Duritz appeared as a guest vocalist on two tracks on Gang of Youths&#x27; third studio album &quot;Angel in Realtime&quot;. Later that year, he confirmed that he had completed writing for &quot;Suite Two&quot;, but that he believed that the initial songwriting was not strong enough. He decided to rewrite the songs and add an additional composition, and that recording for the follow-up could only happen once the band was done with touring.

During the 2022 Butter Miracle Tour, Counting Crows performed live in Israel for the first time, playing in an amphitheater in the city of Ra&#x27;anana. In April 2023, the band returned to Australia and New Zealand for a series of headlining shows, with English musician Frank Turner supporting them. The following year, the Oneness Tour saw them travel with Santana.

On February 21, 2025, the band put out a new single, &quot;Spaceman in Tulsa&quot;, to announce the release date for the upcoming album &quot;Butter Miracle, The Complete Sweets!&quot;. Forgoing a second EP, the new album, with the four songs from the &quot;Suite One&quot; EP plus additional songs, will be released on May 9, 2025.

== Influences, live performances and covers ==

Counting Crows, and Duritz in particular, have become renowned for energetic, passionate live performances. The band&#x27;s influences include Van Morrison, R.E.M., and Bob Dylan.

Several Counting Crows songs have been altered during the band&#x27;s live performances, such as &quot;Round Here&quot;, &quot;Goodnight Elisabeth&quot;, &quot;Rain King&quot;, and &quot;A Murder of One&quot;. This can be heard on the &quot;Across a Wire: Live in New York City&quot; album on the first disc (on which &quot;Round Here&quot; contains lyrics from &quot;Have You Seen Me Lately?&quot;) and the second disc (&quot;Anna Begins&quot; has an extended midsection with new lyrics, and the introduction to &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; includes lyrics from &quot;Miller&#x27;s Angels&quot; and from the Byrds&#x27; &quot;So You Wanna Be A Rock &amp; Roll Star&quot;).

In February 2011, Duritz released an indie album of cover songs he had recorded entitled &quot;All My Bloody Valentines&quot;. He allowed Facebook followers to help name and design the cover art for the album.

The band has sold more than 20 million albums worldwide.

<text>Ink is an unincorporated community in Polk County, Arkansas, United States. The elevation of Ink is 1,033 feet.

A popular and apocryphal story of how the town got its name in 1887 is one based on a misunderstanding. When the townsfolk were completing the government application to establish a post office, they interpreted the instruction &quot;Please write in ink&quot; literally and entered the name &quot;Ink&quot; as the proposed town name. This was accepted as the official name.

The true story is that many towns were trying to register at the same time, and the United States Postal Service was trying very hard to limit the number of duplicate place names. Postmasters of the various post offices trying to register their towns were required to give several name alternatives. Most towns did not get their first, second, or even third choices. Ink was actually the second choice, the first being &quot;Melon.&quot;

<doc id="199584" wikidata="Q907869" url="?curid=199584" title="Fermat's spiral">
<text>A Fermat&#x27;s spiral or parabolic spiral is a plane curve with the property that the area between any two consecutive full turns around the spiral is invariant. As a result, the distance between turns grows in inverse proportion to their distance from the spiral center, contrasting with the Archimedean spiral (for which this distance is invariant) and the logarithmic spiral (for which the distance between turns is proportional to the distance from the center). Fermat spirals are named after Pierre de Fermat. 

Their applications include curvature continuous blending of curves, modeling plant growth and the shapes of certain spiral galaxies, and the design of variable capacitors, solar power reflector arrays, and cyclotrons.

==Coordinate representation==
===Polar===
The representation of the Fermat spiral in polar coordinates is given by the equation
formula_1
for . 

The parameter formula_2 is a scaling factor affecting the size of the spiral but not its shape.

The two choices of sign give the two branches of the spiral, which meet smoothly at the origin. If the same variables were reinterpreted as Cartesian coordinates, this would be the equation of a parabola with horizontal axis, which again has two branches above and below the axis, meeting at the origin.

===Cartesian===
The Fermat spiral with polar equation
formula_1
can be converted to the Cartesian coordinates by using the standard conversion formulas and . Using the polar equation for the spiral to eliminate from these conversions produces parametric equations for one branch of the curve:

: formula_4

and the second one

: formula_5

They generate the points of branches of the curve as the parameter ranges over the positive real numbers.

For any generated in this way, dividing by cancels the parts of the parametric equations, leaving the simpler equation . From this equation, substituting by (a rearranged form of the polar equation for the spiral) and then substituting by (the conversion from Cartesian to polar) leaves an equation for the Fermat spiral in terms of only and :
formula_6
Because the sign of is lost when it is squared, this equation covers both branches of the curve.

== Geometric properties ==
=== Division of the plane ===
A complete Fermat&#x27;s spiral (both branches) is a smooth double point free curve, in contrast with the Archimedean and hyperbolic spiral. Like a line or circle or parabola, it divides the plane into two connected regions.

=== Polar slope ===
From vector calculus in polar coordinates one gets the formula
:formula_7
for the &quot;polar slope&quot; and its angle between the tangent of a curve and the corresponding polar circle (see diagram).

For Fermat&#x27;s spiral one gets
: formula_8
Hence the slope angle is monotonely decreasing.

=== Curvature ===
From the formula

: formula_9

for the curvature of a curve with polar equation and its derivatives
:formula_10
one gets the &quot;curvature&quot; of a Fermat&#x27;s spiral:
formula_11

At the origin the curvature is 0. Hence the complete curve has at the origin an inflection point and the -axis is its tangent there.

=== Area between arcs ===
The area of a &quot;sector&quot; of Fermat&#x27;s spiral between two points and is
: formula_12
After raising both angles by one gets
: formula_13

Hence the area of the region &quot;between&quot; two neighboring arcs is formula_14
 only depends on the &quot;difference&quot; of the two angles, not on the angles themselves.

For the example shown in the diagram, all neighboring stripes have the same area: .

This property is used in electrical engineering for the construction of variable capacitors.

==== Special case due to Fermat ====
In 1636, Fermat wrote a letter to Marin Mersenne which contains the following special case:

Let ; then the area of the black region (see diagram) is , which is half of the area of the circle with radius . The regions between neighboring curves (white, blue, yellow) have the same area . Hence:
* The area between two arcs of the spiral after a full turn equals the area of the circle .

=== Arc length ===
The length of the arc of Fermat&#x27;s spiral between two points can be calculated by the integral:

formula_15

This integral leads to an elliptical integral, which can be solved numerically.

The arc length of the positive branch of the Fermat&#x27;s spiral from the origin can also be defined by hypergeometric functions and the incomplete beta function :

formula_16
=== Circle inversion ===
The inversion at the unit circle has in polar coordinates the simple description .

* The image of Fermat&#x27;s spiral under the inversion at the unit circle is a lituus spiral with polar equation formula_17 When , both curves intersect at a fixed point on the unit circle.
* The tangent (-axis) at the inflection point (origin) of Fermat&#x27;s spiral is mapped onto itself and is the asymptotic line of the lituus spiral.

==The golden ratio and the golden angle==
In disc phyllotaxis, as in the sunflower and daisy, the mesh of spirals occurs in Fibonacci numbers because divergence (angle of succession in a single spiral arrangement) approaches the golden ratio. The shape of the spirals depends on the growth of the elements generated sequentially. In mature-disc phyllotaxis, when all the elements are the same size, the shape of the spirals is that of Fermat spirals—ideally. That is because Fermat&#x27;s spiral traverses equal annuli in equal turns. The full model proposed by H. Vogel in 1979 is

formula_18

where is the angle, is the radius or distance from the center, and is the index number of the floret and is a constant scaling factor. The angle 137.508° is the golden angle which is approximated by ratios of Fibonacci numbers.
The resulting spiral pattern of unit disks should be distinguished from the Doyle spirals, patterns formed by tangent disks of geometrically increasing radii placed on logarithmic spirals.

==Solar plants==

Fermat&#x27;s spiral has also been found to be an efficient layout for the mirrors of concentrated solar power plants.

<text>It&#x27;s-It, released in October 1992, is a remix album by the Icelandic alternative rock band the Sugarcubes. After its release, the Sugarcubes disbanded and lead singer Björk went on to have a successful solo career. One single that was released from this compilation, the Tony Humphries remix of &quot;Leash Called Love&quot; reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot Dance Club Songs Chart in 1992.

A limited edition double-disc set was released in Britain but is now long out of print.

<doc id="199589" wikidata="Q838364" url="?curid=199589" title="Carpet bombing">
<text>Carpet bombing, also known as saturation bombing, is a large area bombardment done in a progressive manner to inflict damage in every part of a selected area of land. The phrase evokes the image of explosions completely covering an area, in the same way that a carpet covers a floor. Carpet bombing is usually achieved by dropping many unguided bombs.

Carpet bombing of cities, towns, villages, or other areas containing a concentration of protected civilians has been considered a war crime since 1977, through Article 51 of Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions.

The term obliteration bombing is sometimes used to describe especially intensified bombing with the intention of destroying a city or a large part of the city. The term area bombing refers to indiscriminate bombing of an area and also encompasses cases of carpet bombing, including obliteration bombing. It was used in that sense especially during World War II and the Korean War.

== Early history ==
One of the first attempts at carpet bombing was at the Battle of El Mazuco during the Spanish Civil War in 1937, against widely-dispersed infantry on rocky slopes, and the attacking Condor Legion learned that carpet bombing was not very effective in such terrain.

In March 1938, the Bombing of Barcelona saw Italian and German airstrikes killing up to 1,300 people and wounding 2,000. It is considered the first carpet bombing of a city, and set a precedent for several such bombings in World War II.

The Japanese bombing of China&#x27;s wartime capital Chongqing from 18 February 1938 to 23 August 1943 caused 23,600 deaths and over 30,000 wounded.

== During World War II ==
===Pre-war expectation===
In the inter-war years, a growing expectation developed that, on the outbreak of war, cities would be rapidly destroyed by bombing raids. The use of poison gas was expected and a high level of devastation was anticipated from high explosive bombs. This originated, in part, from the views of military experts such as Douhet, and was taken up by politicians and journalists, with, for example, Stanley Baldwin coining the phrase &quot;The bomber will always get through&quot;. The targeting of the civilian population would, some theories suggested, cause a breakdown in morale that would lead to civil unrest that would compel a government to surrender. The combatant powers could, according to Baldwin, be in a competition to break the morale of the other side&#x27;s civilian population first.

There were two results from this. Firstly, civil defence programs were set up, with gas masks being issued, plans for air raid shelters were set up and organisations to manage civilians before a raid and deal with damage and casualties after one were put in place. Secondly, agreements were sought to make the targeting of civilians illegal under international law. At the time that Douhet and others were publishing their ideas, no air force had planned their capabilities with the intent of making a &quot;knockout blow&quot; against civilian targets. The Hague Rules of Air Warfare were developed in 1922/23 to prevent deliberately attacking civilians, yet it was not ratified by any country. At the start of World War II, the Royal Air Force had an initial instruction to abide by the Hague Rules for as long as the enemy did. This restraint was followed by both Britain and Germany until 11 May 1940, when, with Winston Churchill now in the role of Prime Minister and the war in France going badly, the RAF attacked industrial and transport infrastructure targets in Mönchengladbach. This raid caused civilian casualties.

===Bombing by Germany===
In the European theatre, the first city to suffer heavily from aerial bombardment was Warsaw, on 25 September 1939 following the start of the German invasion of Poland. Continuing this trend in warfare, the Rotterdam Blitz was an aerial bombardment of Rotterdam by 90 bombers of the German air force on 14 May 1940, during the German invasion of the Netherlands. The objective was to support the German assault on the city, break Dutch resistance, and force the Dutch to surrender. Despite a ceasefire, the bombing destroyed almost the entire historic city centre, killing nearly nine hundred civilians and leaving 30,000 people homeless. The destructive success of the bombing led the &quot;Oberkommando der Luftwaffe&quot; (OKL, the Luftwaffe high command) to threaten to destroy the city of Utrecht if the Dutch Government did not surrender. The Dutch capitulated early the next morning.

As the war progressed, the Battle of Britain developed from a fight for air supremacy into the strategic and aerial bombing of London, Liverpool, Coventry and other British cities. 

===Bombing by the Western Allies===

At the beginning of war, RAF Bomber Command lacked both the navigation systems for finding a target and the numbers of bombers that were needed to make attacks of any scale in Germany. 

As heavy bombers were brought into service and technology and tactics were improved, the selection of targets was changed. The intention of avoiding civilian casualties as collateral damage disappeared. Instead, the civilian population which worked in war-related industriesand their housingbecame the target. 

Some of this change came from a wish to retaliate for the German attack on Coventry. 
It was also based on what was learnt from being the target in the Blitz. It had been found that factory buildings were more resistant to critical damage than the homes of their workers. Absenteeism of the workforce rose significantly if their housing was uninhabitable, so affecting industrial production. Whilst morale was still discussed, the meaning of the word changed from its pre-war usage. Now a reduction in morale was intended to reduce industrial production that supported the war effort. The area bombing directive was issued to RAF Bomber Command in 1942 

The Eighth Air Force of the USAAF arrived in Britain over the summer of 1942. Despite Roosevelt&#x27;s pleas to Hitler to avoid bombing civilians prior to the US joining the war, he was a supporter of bombing Germany. Both Churchill and Roosevelt were in the position that Stalin was pressing for the Western Allies to open a new front in Europesomething which they were not ready to do. Therefore a bombing campaign - the Combined Bomber Offensive - following the Casablanca directive to the Allied air forces was all they could offer to support the Soviet Union. 

Operation Gomorrah, carried out by Bomber Command against Hamburg, targeted a city with both high susceptibility to fire and a large number of factories making products for the German war effort. The raid caused substantial damage to the city, especially the housing of industrial workers. A carefully developed mix of high explosive bombs and incendiaries was used. High explosives broke windows and made fire-fighting dangerous, whilst the incendiaries set the buildings on fire. This methodology was used for further attacks on urban areas (though not with such major effect) throughout the war, with Dresden being one of the final targets.

Carpet bombing was also used as close air support (as &quot;flying artillery&quot;) for ground operations. The massive bombing was concentrated in a narrow and shallow area of the front (a few kilometers by a few hundred meters deep), closely coordinated with the advance of friendly troops. The first successful use of the technique was on 6 May 1943, at the end of the Tunisia Campaign. Carried out under Sir Arthur Tedder, it was hailed by the press as Tedder&#x27;s bomb-carpet (or Tedder&#x27;s carpet). The bombing was concentrated in a four by three-mile area, preparing the way for the First Army. This tactic was later used in many cases in the Normandy Campaign; for example, in the Battle for Caen.

===Pacific War===
In the Pacific War, carpet bombing was used extensively against Japanese cities such as Tokyo. On the night of 9–10 March 1945, 334 B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers were directed to attack the most heavily populated civilian sectors of Tokyo. In just one night, over 100,000 people burned to death from a heavy bombardment of incendiary bombs, comparable to the wartime number of U.S. casualties in the entire Pacific theater. Another 100,000 to one million Japanese were left homeless. These attacks were followed by similar ones against Kobe, Osaka, and Nagoya, as well as other sectors of Tokyo, where over 9,373 tons of incendiary bombs were dropped on civilian and military targets. By the time of the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, light and medium bombers were being directed to bomb targets of convenience, as most urban areas had already been destroyed. In the 9-month long bombing campaign, over 300,000 Japanese civilians died and 400,000 were wounded.

During the final months of the war in the Philippines, the United States military used carpet bombing against the Japanese forces in Manila and Baguio, reducing much of the cities to rubble. Manila became the second-most-destroyed city of World War II.

==Vietnam War==
During the Vietnam War, with the escalating situation in Southeast Asia, twenty-eight B-52Fs were fitted with external racks for twenty-four 750-pound (340 kg) bombs under project &quot;South Bay&quot; in June 1964; an additional forty-six aircraft received similar modifications under project &quot;Sun Bath&quot;. In March 1965, the United States commenced Operation Rolling Thunder. The first combat mission, Operation Arc Light, was flown by B-52Fs on 18 June 1965, when 30 bombers of the 9th and 441st Bombardment Squadrons struck a communist stronghold near the Bến Cát District in South Vietnam. The first wave of bombers arrived too early at a designated rendezvous point, and while maneuvering to maintain station, two B-52s collided, which resulted in the loss of both bombers and eight crewmen. The remaining bombers, minus one more that turned back for mechanical problems, continued toward the target. Twenty-seven Stratofortresses dropped on a one-mile by two-mile target box from between , a little more than 50% of the bombs falling within the target zone. The force returned to Andersen AFB except for one bomber with electrical problems that recovered to Clark AFB, the mission having lasted 13 hours. Post-strike assessment by teams of South Vietnamese troops with American advisors found evidence that the VC had departed the area before the raid, and it was suspected that infiltration of the south&#x27;s forces may have tipped off the north because of the ARVN troops involved in the post-strike inspection.

Beginning in late 1965, a number of B-52Ds underwent &quot;Big Belly&quot; modifications to increase bomb capacity for carpet bombings. While the external payload remained at twenty-four 500-pound (227 kg) or 750-pound (340 kg) bombs, the internal capacity increased from twenty-seven to eighty-four 500-pound bombs or from twenty-seven to forty-two 750-pound bombs. The modification created enough capacity for a total of 60,000 pounds (27,215 kg) in one hundred and eight bombs. Thus modified, B-52Ds could carry 22,000 pounds (9,980 kg) more than B-52Fs. Designed to replace B-52Fs, modified B-52Ds entered combat in April 1966 flying from Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. Each bombing mission lasted 10 to 12 hours with an aerial refueling by KC-135 Stratotankers. In spring 1967, the aircraft began flying from U Tapao Airfield in Thailand giving the aircraft the advantage of not requiring in-flight refueling.

The zenith of B-52 attacks in Vietnam was &quot;Operation Linebacker II&quot; (sometimes referred to as the Christmas Bombing) which consisted of waves of B-52s (mostly D models, but some Gs without jamming equipment and with a smaller bomb load). Over 12 days, B-52s flew 729 sorties and dropped 15,237 tons of bombs on Hanoi, Haiphong, and other targets. Originally 42 B-52s were committed to the war; however, numbers were frequently twice this figure.

<doc id="199593" wikidata="Q847672" url="?curid=199593" title="HMS Ark Royal (R07)">
<text>HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was a light aircraft carrier and former flagship of the Royal Navy. She was the third and final vessel of the . She was built by Swan Hunter on the River Tyne and launched by them in 1981. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was christened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. She followed sister ships and into service in 1985.

Affectionately known as &quot;The Mighty Ark&quot;, she is the fifth Royal Navy ship to have borne the name of the 1587 flagship that defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588. Originally intended to be named to match the rest of the class, this was changed due to the public reaction to the loss of the &quot;Ark Royal&quot; name after the scrapping of the previous &quot;Ark Royal&quot; in 1980, after 30 years&#x27; service.

Slightly larger than her sister ships, and with a steeper ski-jump ramp, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; carried the STOVL (short take off and vertical landing) Harrier jump jet aircraft, as well as various helicopters. With a crew complement of over 1,000 sailors and aviators, she saw active service in the 1990s Bosnian War and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.

Originally due to be retired in 2016, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was instead decommissioned on 11 March 2011, as part of the Navy restructuring portion of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. After &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s decommissioning, replaced her as the Royal Navy flagship. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was sold for scrap to the Turkish company Leyal Ship Recycling and left Portsmouth in May 2013.

==Construction==
The aircraft carrier&#x27;s keel was laid by Swan Hunter at Wallsend on 7 December 1978. She was launched on 2 June 1981 sponsored by The Queen Mother and commissioned on 1 November 1985. Originally intended as in line with her sister ships and , public resentment at the scrapping of the previous (the UK&#x27;s last large aircraft carrier up to that date) in 1980 led the Royal Navy to announce that the name would be revived on the new ship. The unfinished &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was reportedly offered for sale to the Royal Australian Navy in 1981. HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; was later offered for sale instead.

==Operational history==

===1990–1999===
&quot;Ark Royal&quot; was deployed in 1993 to the Adriatic Sea during the Bosnian War under the command of Captain Terry Loughran RN (later rear admiral). In May 1999, she was put into Rosyth for refitting, which included the removal of the Sea Dart surface-to-air missiles and covering over of the foredeck to allow for an enlarged deck park for aircraft.

===2000–2009===
She was recommissioned on 22 November 2001 by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. She sailed to the Persian Gulf for the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. She was commanded by Captain Alan Massey (later Vice Admiral and Second Sea Lord) and sailed with a complement consisting of helicopters alone rather than her usual mix of helicopters and Harrier aircraft. During one of the operations in the war, two Westland Sea King helicopters from 849 Naval Air Squadron collided with each other in mid-air, resulting in the loss of six British and one American. Her deployment to the gulf was filmed throughout by Shine TV for a Channel 5 documentary entitled &#x27;Ark Royal&#x27;.
In April 2004, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; entered into extended readiness, following which she entered refit with the &quot;Illustrious&quot; returning to service. Once her refit was completed, she received a new captain (Captain Mike Mansergh) in August 2006. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; then returned to Portsmouth to rejoin the fleet on 28 October 2006, where she underwent ten weeks of training and sea trials before being utilised as a landing platform helicopter, replacing while she underwent a refit. On 16 November 2006, a British Army WAH-64 Apache attack helicopter landed on &quot;Ark Royal&quot; for the first time marking an increase in the carrier&#x27;s capability.

On 22 March 2007, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was returned to the Royal Navy Fleet after a two-year refit worth £18 million. In May 2007, she once again became the Fleet Flagship, reclaiming the title from her sister ship, &quot;Illustrious&quot;, which had been flagship since the end of her refit in 2005. On 31 July 2008, Mansergh was relieved as captain by Captain John Clink. In October 2008, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was a participant in Exercise Joint Warrior 08-2. In January 2009, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; visited Liverpool and then the River Tyne, where she was built. Her voyage from Portsmouth to Liverpool was made with 108 Cadets from the Sea Cadet Corps and the Combined Cadet Force embarked.

===2010–2011===
During the air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption, the then Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, assigned &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and &quot;Ocean&quot; to rescue stranded travellers across the English Channel in Operation Cunningham. In June 2010, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to take part in the Royal Canadian Navy Centennial Celebrations, where she was visited by Prime Minister David Cameron on his way to the G20 summit in Toronto. During this time, an V-22 Osprey visited the ship, again increasing its capabilities.

On 19 October 2010, BBC News reported that the ship was to be decommissioned and scrapped earlier than expected, as part of the coalition government&#x27;s spending review, and that an 8% cut to the British defence budget was expected to be announced later that week, only to be replaced in the long run with . A campaign was begun in November 2010 to retain the name &quot;Ark Royal&quot; for one of the new carriers. On 3 December 2010, the amphibious warfare ship was announced as &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s successor as the Royal Navy&#x27;s flagship. In recognition of the ship&#x27;s decommissioning, Portsmouth F.C. added the ship&#x27;s motto to its 2011/12 season kit.

On the evening of 19 October, the ship arrived at Portsmouth ready to be decommissioned and laid up. On 5 November she was visited by Queen Elizabeth at Portsmouth before sailing to Loch Long for the removal of all her munitions. She then left the River Clyde on 17 November on her final voyage before decommissioning, visiting North Shields on 18–22 November and Hamburg for five days from 25 November. The latter was her last overseas visit, repeating a previous one in 2007. During the voyage, she launched four Harrier GR9s for the last time in the North Sea on 24 November.

The ship then sailed from Hamburg back into Portsmouth, arriving at 9.40 am on 3 December 2010 flying a decommissioning pennant. A Harrier flypast to mark the occasion was planned, but was postponed due to bad weather. A farewell parade by her captain and crew was held in Guildhall Square in Portsmouth on 22 January 2011 and another in Leeds, the latter being a Freedom of the City parade. Her formal decommissioning occurred at Portsmouth on 11 March 2011. She was then to have sailed to Rosyth or Govan, but was instead de-stored at Portsmouth in late March after her decommissioning, with her last crew members leaving her by 25 May.

==Disposal==

A Ministry of Defence spokesperson stated on 1 December 2010 that, &quot;All options are being considered in terms of what happens to the &quot;Ark Royal&quot; after it is decommissioned. We might also look at scrapping it, selling it or recycling it.&quot; Other options explored were to moor her as a hotel, casino, museum ship or visitor attraction at the Royal Docks in east London or at Mablethorpe in Lincolnshire, along the lines of or . The annual cost of running the ship as a museum was estimated at £1 million. Another option explored was to moor her as a floating helipad in London&#x27;s Royal Albert Dock, though that would have been against the London Plan to create no new helipads in London. Another option considered was to turn &quot;Ark Royal&quot; into a hospital ship with the ability to respond to humanitarian disasters. The possibility of scuttling &quot;Ark Royal&quot; off the Devonshire coast as an artificial reef was also discussed.

On 28 March 2011, the Ministry of Defence placed the decommissioned &quot;Ark Royal&quot; up for sale by auction, with 6 July as the final date for tenders. In June 2012, the MoD confirmed it had not reached a decision on the sale of the ship, following the submission of bids nearly a year previously. In September 2012, the announcement was made that the ship had been sold to Leyal Ship Recycling in Turkey for scrapping, for the sum of £2.9m. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; left Portsmouth on 20 May 2013 to be taken to Leyal Ship Recycling. The ship was towed to scrapyard on 10 June 2013 in Aliağa.

<doc id="199596" wikidata="Q3735453" url="?curid=199596" title="FAO soil classification">
<text>The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) developed a supra-national classification, which offers useful generalizations about pedogenesis in relation to the interactions between the main soil-forming factors. It was first published in form of the UNESCO Soil Map of the World (1974) (scale 1 : 5 M.). Many of the names offered in that classification are known in many countries and do have similar meanings.

Originally developed as a legend to the Soil Map of the World, the classification was applied by United Nations sponsored projects. Many countries modified this system to fit their particular needs.

The Soil Units (106) were mapped as Soil Associations, designated by the dominant soil unit:

* with soil phases (soil properties, such as saline, lithic, stony),
* with three textural classes (coarse, medium, and fine)
* three slopes classes superimposed (level to gently undulating, rolling to hilly, and steeply dissected to mountainous)

The 106 Soil Units form 26 Soil Groups. The FAO soil map was a very simple classification system with units very broad, but was the first truly international system, and most soils could be accommodated on the basis of their field descriptions. The FAO soil map was intended for mapping soils at a continental scale but not at local scale.

In 1988 the FAO published a &quot;Revised Legend&quot; with 153 Soil Units forming 28 Major Soil Groupings. It serves as basis for the &quot;Harmonized World Soil Database&quot;. 

In 1998 this system was replaced by the World Reference Base for Soil Resources.

<doc id="199598" wikidata="Q5298368" url="?curid=199598" title="Dorothy Cross">
<text>Dorothy Cross (born 1956) is an Irish artist. Working with differing media, including sculpture, photography, video and installation, she represented Ireland at the 1993 Venice Biennale. Central to her work as a whole are themes of sexual and cultural identity, personal history, memory, and the gaps between the conscious and subconscious. In a 2009 speech by the president of UCC, Cross was described as &quot;one of Ireland’s leading artists&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Cross was born in 1956 in Cork, Ireland, one of three children of Fergus and Dorothy Cross. Her older brother Tom went on to become a zoologist and professor at University College, Cork, while her older sister Jane was a swimmer who was on a team that set a world relay record at the 1985 World Masters Championships. Cross herself was a competitive swimmer in her teens, becoming All-Ireland champion in the 100-meter breaststroke at the age of 15 and going on to win other medals over the next few years.

Cross attended the Crawford Municipal School of Art in Cork before undertaking degree studies at Leicester Polytechnic, England, from 1974 to 1977. She also studied at the San Francisco Art Institute, California, from 1978 to 1979 and from 1980 to 1982, where she completed an MFA Degree in printmaking.

==Career==

Exhibiting regularly since the mid-1980s, Cross came to mainstream public attention with her first major solo installation, &#x27;Ebb&#x27;, at the Douglas Hyde Gallery in Dublin, Ireland. This was followed, in 1991, by &#x27;Powerhouse&#x27;, at the ICA in Philadelphia, the Hyde Gallery and Camden Arts Centre in London and Kerlin Gallery in Dublin. Like &#x27;Ebb&#x27;, several of the component parts that made up &#x27;Powerhouse&#x27; were &#x27;found&#x27; objects - many of which had been in her family&#x27;s possession for years or were located in different environments. These were then incorporated into mixed media pieces for exhibit. Cross&#x27;s general approach of creating works using found objects has been referred to as &quot;poetic amalgamation&quot;.
During the early 1990s, Cross witnessed a traditional sieve created from a stretched cow&#x27;s udder at a local museum in Norway and stated, &quot;Seeing that a cow could be used for something other than producing milk was a total revelation.&quot; In response, she began producing sculptural works, utilising cured cowhide, cow udders and stuffed snakes, which explored the cultural and symbolic significance of sexuality and subjectivity across cultures. For Cross, the use of udders generated a strange mixture of disgust, hilarity, and excitement. &quot;Virgin Shroud&quot; (1993), for example, is a veil made from cow skin, with the udders forming a crown for the concealed figure; it references both the Virgin Mary and Meret Oppenheim&#x27;s fur-lined teacup that was a partial inspiration for the piece. &quot;Saddle&quot; (also 1993) incorporates an upturned udder into the seat of a horse&#x27;s saddle.

Cross is perhaps best known for her public installation &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; (1998) in which a disused light ship was illuminated through the use of luminous paint, in Scotman&#x27;s Bay, off Dublin&#x27;s Dún Laoghaire Harbour. A recent series, &quot;Medusae&quot;, includes images of Chironex fleckeri, a type of jellyfish and was made in collaboration with her brother Tom.

The Irish Museum of Modern Art held a major retrospective of her work in 2005.

An exhibition, &#x27;View&#x27;, that took place between September and November 2014 at the Kerlin Gallery in Dublin, Ireland, included a series of new sculptures and photographs. The works, which are exemplary of the artist&#x27;s complex exploration of the connection between humans and the natural world, and that play with material, relationship and time, capture the artist&#x27;s ongoing compulsion to agitate possibilities for new perspectives and points of view.

Cross was selected to be part of the curated &#x27;Indra&#x27;s Net&#x27; programme at the 2022 Frieze Art Fair in London.

<doc id="199602" wikidata="Q4768582" url="?curid=199602" title="Anne Madden (artist)">
<text>Anne Madden (born 1932) is an English-born painter, who is well known in both Ireland and France where she has divided her time since her marriage to Louis le Brocquy in 1958.

==Early life==
Anne M. Madden was born in London in 1932 to an Irish father and an Anglo-Chilean mother. Madden spent her first years in Chile, where her father owned a farm. Madden&#x27;s family moved to Corrofin, Ireland when she was ten years old. She subsequently moved to London and attended the Chelsea School of Arts and Crafts.

Her father died in a car crash when she was a teenager. She also lost her sister and brother-in-law in a plane crash, which left Madden as guardian to three young children. Her brother died at a young age of injuries sustained by falling down the stairs. Her work was then interrupted for three years in the 1950s by a series of operations on her spine following a riding accident. During that time she met the painter Louis le Brocquy who was then working in London. They married in Chartres Cathedral in 1958 and set up a house and studio in Carros in the south of France, where they remained until 2000.

== 1950s ==
Madden began exhibiting in group shows in London when she was eighteen. One of her earliest exhibitions was with the New English Art Club. The Burren and her love of lonely places informed these early paintings.

In 1956 Madden visited the groundbreaking &quot;Modern Art in the United States&quot; exhibition at the Tate Gallery which began the assimilation of post-war American art, and in particular the influence of abstract expressionism, into her own works. In the late 1950s Madden was impressed by the works of Sam Francis and Jean-Paul Riopelle after viewing their works at the Royal Academy. She later met these artists in Paris along with Joan Mitchell and others with whom she exchanged works. The techniques employed included palette knife and paint flows and soon involved the use of multiple canvases as a means of creating pictorial interactions.

From 1954 Madden regularly contributed works to the Irish Exhibition of Living Art. At the 21st anniversary show, in 1964, she was awarded the painting prize of £150 for &quot;Promontory&quot;.

==1960s==
In 1960 Madden had a solo exhibition in the Dawson Gallery, Dublin which was a resounding success. The &quot;Irish Times&quot; reviewer commented,&quot;Anne Madden paints landscape with a quite remarkable power to dredge away the soft clothing which covers the land. She reveals the bones, the skeleton, not in the sense that such forms conote decay but rather to recall the simple grandeur which remains in winter snows or when wind has ripped away the foliage.&quot;In the mid 1960s on, their comparatively reclusive life in Carros village was changed by the opening of the Fondation Maeght in Saint-Paul, where over the years they were constantly meeting painters, sculptors, writers, poets, and musicians forming friendships resumed in Paris and elsewhere. Madden was the first recipient of the Carroll Prize in 1964. Madden also had a solo exhibition at the New Gallery in Belfast in the autumn of 1964.

In 1965 Anne Madden represented Ireland at the Paris Biennale, before regularly exhibiting in that city. From the 1960s she began to paint a series of abstract landscapes influenced by her time as a young girl in the west of Ireland, near the Burren in County Clare. In 1966 Madden was one of four invited artists to show at the 9th annual exhibition of the Ulster Society of Women Artists in Belfast.

== 1970s ==
Between 1970 and 1979 Madden painted a large series of vertical works, their size determined by her height and reach. The works derived from megaliths and other prehistoric monuments were reflections on life and death. These works tended to be hard-edged and dark in tone. Madden stated that they were an overt reflection of The Troubles in Northern Ireland,&quot;They tended to be dark tonally, reflections of grief, of the Irish landscape, of an instinctive search to find or extract light from darkness; elegies of personal grief but also to the terrible and tragic events in Northern Ireland.&quot;Madden showed work at the Oireachtas Exhibition in 1971 and had three solo exhibitions in 1974 - at the Ulster Museum, Belfast, the New Art Centre, London, and at the Dawson Gallery in Dublin. Madden held a further one-man show, at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland Gallery in 1979.

== 1980s onwards ==
In the 1980s Madden stopped painting for a time and devoted herself to drawing. This resulted in a series of large works in graphite and oil paint on paper entitled &quot;Openings&quot;. These works formed the core of an exhibition at the Fondation Maeght in 1983. Three of those works were then displayed as part of ROSC &#x27;84 when Madden was one of nine Irish artists invited to show. A self-portrait of Madden was amongst 15 new exhibits inaugurated to the National Self Portrait Collection of Ireland in a show at the Kneafsey Gallery, Limerick, in spring 1987. Madden held a one-woman show of new works at the Taylor Gallery in Dublin in 1987.

In 1990 Madden held a solo show at the Kerlin Gallery in Dublin, where she was to return with &quot;Drawings of Masters&quot; in 1992. Madden returned to painting on canvas. She continued to develop and produce a large body of work which was presented in an Arts Council of Ireland retrospective in 1991, at the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin.

In 1994 Madden received a commission from Ronald Tallon, architect of the O&#x27;Reilly Hall at University College Dublin, to paint one of ten large paintings displayed within the Aula Maxima. In 1999 the French village of Carros commissioned Madden to paint a large vaulted ceiling painting measuring 54m² for its medieval castle which opened as an international contemporary art centre. The artist produced &quot;Empyrius&quot; in her nearby studio before it was mounted in situ as a permanent installation. The venue also has a permanent room dedicated to Madden&#x27;s work.

In 2000, Madden returned to live and work in Dublin, taking over a property which was once Sarah Purser&#x27;s studio. Madden who was a naturalist had grown vines and olives in France, which led her to present a collection entitled &quot;The Garden of Love&quot; at the Taylor Galleries in 2002. Madden showed once more with the Hugh Lane Gallery in 2017 in &quot;Colours of the Wind&quot;, a series of new works referencing Ariadne&#x27;s golden thread, which the mythic figure gave to Theseus when he went into the Minotaur&#x27;s labyrinth.

Madden has been a member of Aosdána since 1986. In 1994, she published a biography about her husband entitled &quot;Louis le Brocquy: Seeing His Way&quot;. The couple had two sons, Pierre and Alexis, born in 1961 and 1963 respectively. In 2004 she was conferred with an honorary degree by University College Dublin and was made an Officier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government the same year.

<text>Patrick Pye RHA (1929 – 8 February 2018) was a sculptor, painter and stained glass artist, resident in County Dublin.

Pye was born in Winchester, England. He died in Dublin, Ireland.

==Career==
Major commissions can be seen across Ireland. In 1999 a retrospective of his work was exhibited by the Royal Hibernian Academy. He is a founding member of Aosdána.

He has been described as &quot;the most important creative artist in the sphere of religious thought in Ireland in our time&quot;.

The poet Michael Longley described the way Pye was treated in the last year of his life as &quot;crass, unforgivably crass&quot;.

<text>The Presidential Commission () is a body which performs the functions of the president of Ireland in the case of a vacancy or temporary absence.

==Membership==
Three members serve on the Presidential Commission.

The President of the High Court acts as a member in place of the Chief Justice if that office is vacant. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle acts as a member in place of the Ceann Comhairle if that office is vacant. The Leas-Chathaoirleach acts as a member in place of the Cathaoirleach if that office is vacant. The Commission may act with at least two members.

A proposal to abolish the Seanad, which was rejected at referendum in 2013, would have seen the Leas-Cheann Comhairle take the place of the Cathaoirleach on the Commission.

==Powers==
The Presidential Commission fulfills all functions and duties of the office of President of Ireland when the office of President is vacant, or when the President is unavailable.

Vacancy may occur:
* on the death of the incumbent, as in 1974;
* on the resignation of the incumbent, as in 1976 and 1997;
* by impeachment of the incumbent, which has never happened.
* in the short interval between the conclusion of one president&#x27;s term of office and the inauguration of a successor the next day — although the Presidential Commission has never been required to act in this time.

The Presidential Commission has often acted when the president is abroad, typically while making a state visit. When the 22nd government of Ireland collapsed in November 1992, president Mary Robinson was abroad. The resignation of the Progressive Democrats ministers, the appointment by Taoiseach Albert Reynolds of caretaker Fianna Fáil replacement ministers, and Reynolds&#x27; request for a dissolution of the Dáil, were all effected by the Presidential Commission. Temporary illness may also indispose the President. No President has ever refused to fulfil any of the duties of office.

Bills have occasionally been signed into law by the presidential commission while the president is out of the country; for example, the presidential commission signed the Marriage Act 2015 legislating for same-sex marriage as Michael D. Higgins was in the United States.

==Origins==

The Presidential Commission was created in the 1937 Constitution of Ireland. It was first used between 29 December 1937, when the Constitution came into force, and 25 June 1938, when the first president was inaugurated. During this period, under the Transitory Provisions of the Constitution, the commission consisted of Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, and the Ceann Comhairle. Its composition differed from later commissions, as Seanad Éireann had not been constituted and elected.

==Members of the Presidential Commission as acting President of Ireland==

<doc id="199608" wikidata="Q1750628" url="?curid=199608" title="Merrie Melodies">
<text>Merrie Melodies is an American animated comedy short film series distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It was part of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; franchise and featured many of the same characters. It originally ran from August 1931, to September 20, 1969, during the golden age of American animation, though it was revived in 1979, with new shorts sporadically released until June 13, 1997. Originally, &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; placed emphasis on one-shot color films in comparison to the black-and-white &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; films. After Bugs Bunny became the breakout character of &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; transitioned to color production in the early 1940s, the two series gradually lost their distinctions and shorts were assigned to each series randomly.

&quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; was originally produced by Harman–Ising Pictures from 1931 to 1933 and Leon Schlesinger Productions from 1933 to 1944. Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros. in 1944, and the newly renamed Warner Bros. Cartoons continued production until 1963. It was outsourced to DePatie–Freleng Enterprises and Format Productions from 1964 to 1967, and Warner Bros.-Seven Arts Animation resumed production for its final two years of the golden age era. When the series was revived in 1979, DePatie–Freleng produced new shorts briefly, but they were replaced by Chuck Jones Productions the following year. During its final years, the series was produced by Warner Bros. Animation.

The films &quot;Tweetie Pie&quot;, &quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot; and &quot;Birds Anonymous&quot; each won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film and another three (&quot;Duck Amuck&quot;, &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot;) have been inducted into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress.

In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked the Warner Bros. Cartoons (ranked as &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;) the third Greatest Cartoon of All Time (out of 60), one of only six film series to make the list (the other five being the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; series, &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot;, &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot;, &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; and &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;).

== Background ==
Producer Leon Schlesinger had already produced the music-based &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series, and its success prompted him to try to sell a sister series to Warner Bros. His selling point was that the new cartoons would feature music from the soundtracks of Warner Bros. films and would thus serve as advertisements for Warner Bros. recordings and sheet music. The studio agreed, and Schlesinger dubbed the series &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;. Walt Disney Productions had already scored with their &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;. Since cartoon production usually began with a soundtrack, animating a piece of music made it easier to devise plot elements and even characters.

The origins of the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series begin with the failure of a live action series of musical shorts called &quot;Spooney Melodies,&quot; which featured popular songs of the day. These shorts included segments with a popular artist singing along with appropriate background sequences. Warner Bros. wanted to promote this music because they had recently acquired (in 1930) the ownership of Brunswick Records along with four music publishers for US $28 million. Because of the success of their &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series, Warner Bros. decided to develop a new series of animated musical shorts called &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;. Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising led the development. It was meant to be a series of musical cartoons that featured hit songs of the day, especially those then owned by Warner Bros. and featured in their musical films. In 1931, many of the shorts featured the orchestra of Abe Lyman.

The first cartoon of the new &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series was &quot;Lady, Play Your Mandolin!&quot;, released in 1931. Ising attempted to introduce several characters in his &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; films, such as Piggy, Foxy, and Goopy Geer. Eventually however, the series continued without any recurring characters. The shorts proved to be enormously popular with the public. In 1932, a &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon, entitled &quot;It&#x27;s Got Me Again!&quot;, was nominated for the first Academy Award to be given for animation.

When Harman and Ising left Warner Bros., in 1933, they took with them all rights to the characters they had created. Leon Schlesinger had to negotiate with them to keep the rights to the name &quot;Merrie Melodies,&quot; as well as for the right to use the slogan, &quot;So Long Folks,&quot; at the end of the cartoons. In 1934, Schlesinger produced his first color &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts, &quot;Honeymoon Hotel&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, which were produced in two-strip Cinecolor (Disney then had exclusive animation rights to the richer three-strip Technicolor process). Their success convinced Schlesinger to produce all future &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts in color, using two-strip Technicolor. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; continued in black and white until 1943. In 1936, the cartoons began to end with the slogan &quot;That&#x27;s all Folks!&quot; which had previously only been used on the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series. The old slogan &quot;So Long, Folks!&quot; was completely abandoned at this time. The same year, &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; began using the &quot;bulls-eye&quot; opening and closing title sequences (beginning in 1942, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; used the same titles, usually in thicker rings). Also by 1936, Disney&#x27;s exclusivity on the three-color Technicolor process was lifted, allowing &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; a full color palette for the first time, hence the use of the blue concentric rings (as a technical test) for the rest of the 1935–36 season and the 1936–37 season. The Warner Bros. shield was later that year changed to cyan before definitely changing back to red in 1938.

Contractually, &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons were obligated to include at least one full chorus from a Warner Bros. song. Warner Bros. requested that these songs be performed by name bands whenever possible, but this lasted only through the first few shorts. The policy annoyed the animators of &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, since the songs often interrupted the cartoons&#x27; momentum and pacing (the 1938 Merrie Melodie &quot;A Feud There Was&quot;, for example, sarcastically uses the obligatory musical number as a shift in the action, with the lead characters singing the number into a KFWB microphone and ceding the mike to an announcer who reads a commercial). By 1940, the animators had been released from this obligation, and the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts came to resemble more closely the black-and-white &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series. In addition, several new characters were created to (initially) appear exclusively in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series, such as Egghead, Elmer Fudd, Inki, Sniffles, and even Warner Bros.&#x27; most popular cartoon star, Bugs Bunny.

In 1943, Schlesinger began producing &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; in color as well, and the two series became virtually indistinguishable except by their theme music and opening titles – in addition, characters once exclusive to one series began regularly appearing in the other as well. In 1944, the studio went to an all-color schedule; though for the first year of this, Bugs still appeared mainly in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series (not appearing in a &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon until the end of August), whereas Daffy Duck and Porky Pig (who each appeared in a few &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; prior to mid-1942) appeared mainly in &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; that year. It was not until 1945 that the two series appeared completely indistinguishable, and that Bugs appeared in more &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; than &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;.

By 1937, the theme music for &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; was &quot;The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down&quot; by Cliff Friend and Dave Franklin, and the theme music for &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; was an adaptation of &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; by Charles Tobias, Murray Mencher and Eddie Cantor (the original theme was &quot;Get Happy&quot; by Harold Arlen, played at a faster tempo). This continued until 1964, when the WB cartoon logos were modernized, and &quot;The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down&quot; became the theme for the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; as well. When the studio went to full color, even the animators themselves did not make any creative distinction between the two series, as evidenced in an interview quote from director Friz Freleng, &quot;I never knew if a film I was making would be &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; or &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, and what the hell difference would it make, anyway?&quot;. The last &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon was &quot;Injun Trouble&quot;, released in 1969. The &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; theatrical cartoons didn&#x27;t start up again until 1988 with only two cartoons made, &quot;The Night of the Living Duck&quot; (1988) and &quot;(Blooper) Bunny&quot; (1991). &quot;The Night of the Living Duck&quot; got a theatrical release through the compilation film &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Quackbusters&quot; (1988), while &quot;(Blooper) Bunny&quot; was shelved from its intended 1991 release until it premiered on Cartoon Network on June 13, 1997.

== Blue Ribbon reissues ==

Beginning in late 1943, WB, in a cost-conserving effort, began to reissue its backlog of color cartoons under a new program that they called &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; classics. For the reissue, the original front-and-end title sequences were altered. The revised main title card began with the zooming WB logo, followed by the title logo set against a background featuring a &quot;blue ribbon&quot; (hence the re-release program&#x27;s title) and a Grand Shorts Award trophy, followed by the name of the cartoon. This revised title sequence eliminated the opening technical credits. The ending title card was also revised, replacing the original versions. Also, sometimes the title of the short was slightly altered for the rerelease; the &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; version of the Bugs Bunny short &quot;A Wild Hare&quot; was retitled &quot;The Wild Hare&quot; for reissue, for example. Many of these &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; prints were the versions used for television broadcasts for many years until Warner Bros. began a restoration program in the early 2000s as part of the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection&quot; DVD releases.

TVLine lists the theme song from the series among the best animated series themes of all time.

=== Inducted into the National Film Registry ===
* &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; (1957), inducted in the 1992 list. &quot;In this animation classic, Elmer Fudd&#x27;s pursuit of Bugs Bunny is set to opera music and plays out on a Wagnerian scale. The film features such now-classic lines as &quot;Kill the wabbit!&quot; and is one of only three cartoons in which Elmer Fudd bests his rival Bugs. Directed by renowned animator Chuck Jones and his team at Warner Bros., this seven-minute short film is often considered to be Jones&#x27; cinematic masterpiece. It also holds the distinction of being the first cartoon selected for inclusion on the National Film Registry.&quot;
* &quot;Duck Amuck&quot; (1953), inducted in the 1999 list. The description reads: &quot;One of the defining examples of Chuck Jones&#x27; irreverent creativity, &quot;Duck Amuck&quot; (a Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; animation) stars Daffy Duck, as brought to life by master voice artist Mel Blanc. Jones&#x27; gives the audience a convincingly fleshed-out character with true personality, regardless of plot or setting. Daffy begins the film as a Musketeer before his animators get the best of him by forgetting to draw in his backgrounds or supply him his voice. Extraordinarily self-reflexive, &quot;Duck Amuck&quot; does more than pierce film&#x27;s fourth wall, it demolishes it, full send Daffy on a series of surreal misadventures.&quot;
* &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot; (1955), inducted in the 2003 list. The description reads: &quot;A cartoon on every short list of the greatest animation, this classic Chuck Jones creation features crooning amphibian Michigan J. Frog, who drives his owner insane by singing only in private, but never in public.&quot;

<text>Camille Souter (born Betty Pamela Holmes; 22 October 1929 – 3 March 2023) was a British-born Irish abstract and landscape artist. She lived and worked on Achill Island and was a Saoi of Aosdána.

== Early life ==
Souter was born Betty Pamela Holmes in Northampton, England, on 22 October 1929, but she was raised in Ireland. Souter received a general education at Glengara Park School in Dun Laoghaire. She originally trained as a nurse at Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London. Souter began painting, after attending art classes as part of occupational therapy whilst she recovered from tuberculosis on the Isle of Wight. Although largely self-taught, Souter took up sculpture in 1950 as her convalescence continued in Dublin. She was trained there by Yann Renard-Goulet. Souter returned to London and completed her nursing studies in 1952, before abandoning the profession in favour of painting. In 1953 she began to explore the medium of paint after visiting Italy. Early patrons of her work included Basil Goulding, Gordon Lambert and the architect, Michael Scott.

== Personal life ==
Her name &#x27;&quot;Camille&quot; was a nickname given to her by her first husband, the actor Gordon Souter, after the heroine of Alexandre Dumas&#x27; &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot;. The couple were married in 1953 and separated in 1955. They had a daughter together, before Camille left for Italy with the artist Ralph Rumney. Souter married the sculptor Frank Morris in 1960 and moved to Enniskerry, County Wicklow before settling at Calary Bog. The couple had four children together before Morris died of sepsis in 1970.

Souter died at the Dublin residence of her daughter, Natasha, on 3 March 2023. She was 93.

== Career ==
Souter&#x27;s first solo show was at El Habano restaurant on Grafton Street in Dublin in 1956. The Clog Gallery in Dublin staged a solo exhibition of Souter&#x27;s work, a mix of oils, gouache, and monotypes, in the following year. The New Vision Gallery in London showed her works in 1958. Souter won a scholarship that took her back to Italy for a year in 1958. In 1961 she represented Ireland at the Paris Biennal. Souter had works simultaneously in a two-person exhibition with Barrie Cooke at the Ulster Museum in 1965, whilst also showing eight works at the New Gallery on Belfast&#x27;s Grosvenor Road, including &quot;Northern Plains (Winter)&quot;, &quot;Town Creeping Out&quot;, and &quot;Trains and All That&quot;. In 1971 four of Souter&#x27;s works were included in &quot;The Irish Imagination 1959-1971&quot; in the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery, which later in the same year travelled to Washington to promote Irish Culture abroad. In 1975 she received the Irish American Cultural Institute&#x27;s Gainey Award. This was followed in 1977 by the Grand Prix International de l&#x27;Art Contemporain de Monte Carlo.

Souter&#x27;s subject matter has included landscapes, still lifes and slaughterhouses. In a review of Camille Souter&#x27;s joint show with Nano Reid in 1999, Vona Groarke wrote &quot;Camille Souter&#x27;s paintings have a statuesque elegance to them, even when the subject is something as banal as silage bags. She is an artist who avoids prettiness while seeking beauty.&quot;

Souter exhibited frequently with the Irish Exhibition of Living Art since 1953, the Independent Artists since 1960, and with the Oireachtas since 1970, where she won the 1973 Landscape Prize. The Bank of Ireland held her painting &quot;Over the Bog&quot;, created in 1962. This painting was donated by the bank in 2008 to the Irish Museum of Modern Art. The Douglas Hyde Gallery held a retrospective of her work in 1980, as did the Royal Hibernian Academy in 2001.

Souter won many awards including the Tony O&#x27;Malley award in 1998, and the Irish Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s Distinguished Career Award in 2000. In 2015, Trinity College Dublin awarded her an honorary doctorate. She was elected Saoi of Aosdána in 2008, where she was first elected a member in 1981. Souter lived and worked on Achill Island. Her works can be seen in many public and private collections including the National Gallery of Ireland, the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery, Ulster Museum, Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Arts Council of Ireland collection.

<text>Imogen Stuart (née Werner; 1927 – 24 March 2024) was a German-Irish sculptor, influenced by 19th-century Expressionism and early Irish Christian art. She mainly produced wood and stone for settings for churches but also created many secular works, and was exhibited internationally.

Born and raised in pre-war Berlin as the daughter of the internationally known art critic Bruno E. Werner, she was exposed to modern developments in the visual arts from an early age and a significant influence on her later work. She studied in Bavaria under the sculptor and professor Otto Hitzberger, who became an early mentor. She met her fellow Hitzberger student and later important Irish sculptor Ian Stuart while in Bavaria in 1948. The couple moved to Ireland in 1961, at first living at his parents&#x27; house in Glendalough, Co. Wicklow, before moving to Sandycove, Co. Dublin. Ian Stuart was the grandson of the Irish republican revolutionary Maud Gonne. They had three daughters but divorced in 1973.

During her long career, she became one of Ireland&#x27;s best-known sculptors, with her work placed in both public spaces and private collections throughout Europe and the U.S.

==Life==
===Early life===
Born Imogen Werner in Berlin in 1927, she was the daughter of Katharina (née Klug), a former art history student originally from Upper Silesia (now part of Poland), and the influential and internationally known art critic and writer Bruno E. Werner (1896–1964), Germany&#x27;s leading art critic and an editor for the &quot;Deutsche Allgemeine&quot; newspaper, who had championed the Bauhaus movement. Imogen and her only sibling, Sybil, spent their childhoods in pre-war 1920s Berlin. Encouraged by their father, the two developed an interest in drawing and sculpting at a young age. Both were taught the techniques of arts and crafts and sculpture by friends of their father.
By early 1945, when the Russian army was advancing towards Berlin, Imogen&#x27;s &quot;golden childhood came to an end&quot; and both daughters were moved to a convent in Bavaria, while their father went into hiding from the Nazis. He was in Dresden, where he had grown up, during the February 1945 bombing of the city. He recounted the experience in his best-selling 1949 book &quot;Die Galeere&quot;.

In Munich, she studied under the sculptor and professor Otto Hitzberger, a retired professor for the Berlin University of the Arts, who taught her modelling, carving and relief techniques across a variety of materials. He became her mentor and she later described him as her most important influence.

There, in 1948 she met her future husband, the Irishman Ian Stuart (1926–2013). He had also studied under Hitzberger and is often referred to as the &quot;finest Irish sculptor&quot; of his generation.

===Move to Ireland===
They became inseparable during their early time together, when Stuart would sing Irish rebel songs to her. The couple first visited Ireland in 1949 and moved permanently there that year, at first living in with his parents at Laragh Castle near Glendalough, County Wicklow, into what the writer Kate Robinson described as a family containing a &quot;notable mixture of politics and literature&quot;. Ian&#x27;s mother Iseult Gonne was married to the writer Francis Stuart and was the daughter of Maud Gonne, the Irish revolutionary and feminist, known internationally as the muse for the poet W. B. Yeats. She was not intimidated by his family, being a highly educated and skilled artist in her own right. By coincidence, Iseult was a friend of the German diplomat Eduard Hempel, a former German Minister to Ireland who was a friend of Imogen&#x27;s father.

Imogen said of her relocation to Ireland: &quot;It is very hard to describe how different this country was from the country from which I had come. It was a totally different world, on a different planet. The Catholicism, the nationalism, the magical countryside, made it all seem like going back a hundred years.&quot; They had three daughters: Aoibheann, Siobhan and Aisling. Siobhan died in a car crash in September 1998 and is buried in Glendalough. 

Both were preoccupied with religious sculpture in wood and stone throughout their careers. They held a number of joint exhibitions, notably in 1959 at the Dawson gallery, Dublin, while they both exhibited at the 1962 Biennale in Salzburg, Austria. Although she became somewhat overshadowed by her husband during this early period, during which she held only a few one-woman shows.

===Commissions===
In the 1970s the Church began to seek a revival of religious art, led by a number of progressive leaders who recognised that the Church had under-invested in this aspect for centuries, with Imogen becoming a favourite of many church leaders; notably, she was given the newly created title &quot;Artist in Charge&quot; of the redesign of a number of churches, meaning she was given responsibility for hiring other artists, as well as architects, craftsmen and masons. This led to the careers of a number of notable Irish visual artists, of whom one of the best known is the stained glass designer Harry Clarke (b. 1889).

===Later life===
Stuart spent most of her life in Ireland. She died aged 96 on 24 March 2024, having been actively working until near the end of her life.

==Style and material==

Stuart&#x27;s work is informed by 19th century German expressionist sculptors such as Ernst Barlach, but in a sensibility also influenced by the later Romanesque and Gothic art periods. She primarily carved wood, but also worked from bronze, stone, steel, clay and terracotta.

Her first impression of Ireland in the late 1950s was of a country lackeing a distinct visual culture, which then sought to lay foundations for. Her work often combines modern European trends in modern art with styles and motifs from early medieval Irish illuminated manuscripts and Insular metalwork. It has been described as having a deep foundation in Christian spirituality, but in &quot;its deceptive simplicity&quot; is both modern and devotional.

She also produced collections of silver, gold and bronze jewellery and a series of drawings.

==Work==

She became a prolific sculptor for both Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland church interiors. Well-known examples include the altarpieces and baptismal font in the Honan Chapel, in Cork City.

Her work also includes public art and monuments and portrait heads, including a bust of ex-president Mary Robinson now in Áras an Uachtaráin (the presidential residence in Dublin), and a Bust of the art critic Brian Fallon. Her public sculptures include the monumental sculpture of Pope John Paul II in St. Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth, the 2005 &quot;Flame Of Human Dignity&quot; at the Centre Culturel Irlandais, Paris,

Her 1969 &quot;Statue of Saint Brendan&quot; was created with Ian Stuart and is positioned in the town square in Bantry, County Cork.

The stations of the Cross in Ballintubber Abbey, Co. Mayo. by Imogen Stuart are were commissioned in the early 1970&#x27;s, Imogen repainted all the stations of the Cross for the Abbey&#x27;s Octo Centenery in 2016, the station of the cross are displayed with pride on the walls of the Nave of the Historic Abbey.

She worked with architects, designers and metalsmiths throughout her career, including with Vicki Donovan, Phil O&#x27;Neill and Ciaran Byrne. With Donovan she produced the silver tabernacle in St. Mel&#x27;s Cathedral, Longford.

==Legacy==
A professor of sculpture at the Royal Hibernian Academy, Dublin, she was also a member of Aosdána, and received honorary doctorates from Trinity College Dublin (2002), University College Dublin (2004), and NUI Maynooth (2005). She was elected Saoi (&quot;wise one&quot;) by Aosdána in 2015 as the highest honour that can be bestowed by the state-supported association of Irish creative artists.

In 2010 she was awarded the McAuley medal (named after Catherine McAuley, founder of the Sisters of Mercy in 1831) by the Irish president Mary McAleese, who paid tribute to her &quot;genius&quot;, crafting &quot;a canon of work that synthesises our complex past, present images and possible futures...as an intrinsic part of the narrative of modern Irish art&quot;. The biography &quot;Imogen Stuart, Sculptor&quot; on her work and life was published in 2002 by the art critic and writer Brian Fallon, and included a foreword by the archaeologist and historian Peter Harbison.

<doc id="199614" wikidata="Q445203" url="?curid=199614" title="Frenulum">
<text>A frenulum or frenum (: frenula or frena, from the Latin &quot;frēnulum&quot;, &quot;little bridle&quot;, the diminutive of &quot;frēnum&quot;) is a small fold of tissue that secures the motion of a mobile organ in the body.

== In human anatomy ==

Frenula on the human body include several in the mouth, some in the digestive tract, and some connected to the external genitalia.
*Brain: &quot;Frenulum of superior medullary velum&quot; or &quot;frenulum veli&quot;
*Digestive tract: &quot;frenulum valvae ileocaecalis&quot;
*Oral tissue: Frenula of the mouth include the frenulum of the tongue or &quot;frenulum linguae&quot; under the tongue, the &quot;frenulum labii superioris&quot; inside the upper lip, the &quot;frenulum labii inferioris&quot; inside the lower lip, and the buccal frena which connect the cheeks to the gum. These can easily be torn by violent blows to the face or mouth, thus a torn frenulum is sometimes a warning sign of physical abuse. 
*Penile tissue: The word &quot;frenulum&quot; on its own is often used for the penile frenulum or &quot;frenulum preputii penis&quot;, which is an elastic band of tissue under the glans penis that connects to the foreskin to the ventral mucosa, and helps contract the prepuce over the glans.
*Vulvar tissue: In females, genital frenula include the &quot;frenulum clitoridis&quot; of the clitoris and the &quot;frenulum labiorum pudendi&quot; (&quot;fourchette&quot;) where the labia minora meet at the back.

An overly short oral or genital frenulum may require a frenulectomy or frenuloplasty to achieve normal mobility.

==In insects==
The word frenulum also refers to a bristle present at the root of the hindwing of most moths which engages with a small hook or tuft on the forewing (the retinaculum) to join the wings together.

==See also==
* Frenectomy – surgical removal of frenula
* Frenuloplasty – surgical alterations of frenula
* Frenulum breve
* Frenulum veli

<doc id="199615" wikidata="Q7240620" url="?curid=199615" title="Preparations for the 2003 invasion of Iraq">
<text>The 2003 invasion of Iraq began on March 20. On March 18, US President George W. Bush had set a deadline for the ruler of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, and his two sons, Uday and Qusay, to leave the country or face military action. By the time of the ultimatum, political and military preparations for the invasion were well advanced. 

Plans for securing Iraqi cities following the invasion, infrastructure reconstruction, and transitioning the country into a post-war government – plans to &quot;win the peace&quot; — were either nonexistent or woefully inadequate. The lack of a post-invasion security plan allowed widespread looting and the violent insurgency that immediately followed the invasion. The looting &quot;caused far more damage to Iraq&#x27;s infrastructure than the bombing campaign&quot; and suggested to the insurgents that the US military was vulnerable. The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction wrote, &quot;There was insufficient systematic planning for human capital management in Iraq before and during the U.S.-directed stabilization and reconstruction operations.&quot;

Former UK Minister of Defence Geoff Hoon commented on this issue in 2007 and said, &quot;There was an enormous amount of post-war planning. It&#x27;s one of the things that the newspapers have never troubled to look at. I accept, and I&#x27;ve said so publicly, that we perhaps did not anticipate quite the kinds of trouble that we would have. I think we thought that because the population of Iraq hated Saddam Hussein, they would simply come out on the streets and everything would be fine... I don&#x27;t think we quite estimated the degree of control that Saddam&#x27;s people had in Iraqi society... So the kind of things we were planning for, with the benefit of hindsight, perhaps weren&#x27;t quite the right things. But they were the right things in terms of the problems that we anticipated, which was the lack of food, water. We probably didn&#x27;t quite appreciate, as I say, the ruthlessness of some of Saddam&#x27;s [followers].&quot;

== Political preparations ==

Political preparation for war began in earnest during the period of weapons inspections in Iraq over the winter of 2002–2003, carried out by a team led by Hans Blix with the authority of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441. The U.S. and its principal allies, the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal, maintained a skeptical position on the results of the inspections procedure. Under pressure from his Secretary of State, Colin Powell, and his main ally, the UK, President Bush decided to try to obtain UN backing for an invasion. The so-called &quot;second resolution&quot; (the first being 1441) was eventually drafted and presented to the UN Security Council. It was a tough resolution, calling for immediate compliance with the previous resolutions requiring disarmament, and setting a 10-day deadline for compliance. Critics saw it as an unrealistic ultimatum designed to provide the U.S. with a cause for war, and it met considerable opposition in the security council, with opponents including the permanent members France, China, and Germany. After a period of intense diplomacy, President Bush met with his British, Spanish and Portuguese counterparts, Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prime Minister José María Aznar and Prime Minister José Manuel Barroso in the Azores, Portugal on March 15 and 16. Declaring that &quot;diplomacy had failed,&quot; he announced the intention to drop the proposed resolution. Subsequently, both the U.S. and the UK accused France of effectively blocking the negotiations by threatening to veto the proposed resolution &quot;whatever the circumstances&quot;, but France maintained that its position had been intentionally misconstrued. Lacking the &quot;second resolution&quot;, the U.S. announced its intention to attack Iraq regardless if Saddam Hussein did not abdicate.

The U.S.&#x27;s rationale for war depended on several contentions. First, it contended that Iraq was in possession of weapons of mass destruction, which it claimed he might be willing to supply to terrorists. Second, it accused Iraq of supporting terrorism, notably through payments to families of Palestinian suicide bombers. In this way, the U.S. contended, Iraq presented a threat that it would be justified in removing, placing this as a new interpretation of the doctrine of self-defense. Third, it stated that the U.S. was legally justified in taking military action by previous UN resolutions, most notably 1441, which stated that &quot;serious consequences&quot; would result from a failure to disarm on Iraq&#x27;s part.

<doc id="199617" wikidata="Q111074" url="?curid=199617" title="John Barry (composer)">
<text>John Barry Prendergast (3 November 1933 – 30 January 2011) was an English composer and conductor of film music. Born in York, Barry spent his early years working in cinemas owned by his father. During his national service with the British Army in Cyprus, Barry began performing as a musician after learning to play the trumpet. Upon completing his national service, he formed a band in 1957, the John Barry Seven. He later developed an interest in composing and arranging music, making his début for television in 1958. He came to the notice of the filmmakers of the first James Bond film &quot;Dr. No&quot;, who were dissatisfied with a theme for James Bond given to them by Monty Norman. Noel Rogers, the head of music at United Artists, approached Barry. This started a successful association between Barry and the Bond series that lasted for 25 years.

He composed the scores for eleven of the &quot;James Bond&quot; films between 1963 and 1987, as well as arranging and performing the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; for the first film in the series, 1962&#x27;s &quot;Dr. No&quot;. He wrote the Grammy- and Academy Award-winning scores to the films &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; (1990) and &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1985), as well as the scores of &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (1995), &quot;Chaplin&quot; (1992), &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984), &quot;Game of Death&quot; (1972), &quot;The Tamarind Seed&quot; (1974), &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971) and the theme for the television series &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;, in a career spanning over 50 years. In 1999, he was appointed with an OBE for services to music.

Barry received awards including five Academy Awards: two for &quot;Born Free&quot; and one each for &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (for which he also won the first BAFTA Award for Best Film Music), &quot;Out of Africa&quot; and &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; (both of which also won him Grammy Awards). He also received ten Golden Globe Award nominations, winning once for Best Original Score for &quot;Out of Africa&quot; in 1986. Barry completed his last film score, &quot;Enigma&quot;, in 2001 and recorded the successful album &quot;Eternal Echoes&quot; the same year. He then concentrated chiefly on live performances and co-wrote the music to the musical &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; in 2004 alongside Don Black.

In 2001, Barry became a Fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, and, in 2005, he was made a Fellow of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Barry was married four times and had four children. He moved to the United States in 1975 and lived there until his death in 2011.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Barry was born John Barry Prendergast in York, the youngest of four children. His mother, a classical pianist, was English; his Irish father, John Xavier &quot;Jack&quot; Prendergast from Cork, was a projectionist during the silent film era and later owned a chain of cinemas across northern England. As a result of his father&#x27;s work, Barry was raised in and around cinemas in northern England and he later stated that this childhood background influenced his musical tastes and interests. He had two older brothers and one older sister. Barry was educated at St Peter&#x27;s School, York, and received composition lessons from Francis Jackson, Organist of York Minster.

===Career===
Barry spent his national service in the British Army playing the trumpet, working from a correspondence course with jazz composer Bill Russo. After national service he worked as an arranger for the orchestras of Jack Parnell and Ted Heath, forming his own band, the John Barry Seven, in 1957. The John Barry Seven recorded hit records on EMI&#x27;s Columbia label including &quot;Hit and Miss&quot;, the theme tune he composed for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; programme; a cover of the Johnny Smith song &quot;Walk Don&#x27;t Run&quot;; and a cover of the theme for the United Artists western &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;.

By 1959 Barry was gaining commissions to arrange music for other acts, starting with a young trio on Decca, coincidentally called the Three Barry Sisters, though unrelated both to Barry and American duo The Barry Sisters. The career breakthrough for Barry was the BBC television series &quot;Drumbeat&quot;, when he appeared with the John Barry Seven. He was employed by EMI from 1959 until 1962 arranging orchestral accompaniments for the company&#x27;s singers, including Adam Faith. He also composed songs (along with Les Vandyke) and scores for films in which Faith was featured. When Faith made his first film, &quot;Beat Girl&quot; (1960), Barry composed, arranged and conducted the film score, his first. His music was later released as the UK&#x27;s first soundtrack album.

Barry also composed the music for another Faith film, &quot;Never Let Go&quot; (also 1960), orchestrated the score for &quot;Mix Me a Person&quot; (1962), and composed, arranged and conducted the score for &quot;The Amorous Prawn&quot; (also 1962). In 1962, Barry transferred to Ember Records, where he produced and arranged albums.

These achievements caught the attention of the producers of a new film called &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962) who were dissatisfied with a theme for James Bond given to them by Monty Norman. Barry was hired and his arrangement of Norman&#x27;s composition created the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;. When the producers of the Bond series sought to hire Lionel Bart to score the next James Bond film &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963), they learned that Bart could not read or write music. Though Bart wrote a title song for the film, the producers remembered Barry&#x27;s arrangement of the James Bond Theme and his composing and arranging for several films with Adam Faith. Bart also recommended Barry to producer Stanley Baker for his 1964 film &quot;Zulu&quot;. That same year Bart and Barry collaborated on the film &quot;Man in the Middle&quot;; and then, in 1965, Barry worked with director Bryan Forbes in scoring the World War II prison-camp drama &quot;King Rat&quot;.

This was the turning point for Barry, and he subsequently won five Academy Awards and four Grammy Awards, with scores for, among others, &quot;Born Free&quot; (1966), &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (1968), &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969) for which he did not receive an on-screen credit, and &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (1980).

Barry was often cited as having had a distinct style which concentrated on lush strings and extensive use of brass. He was one of the first to employ synthesizers in a film score (&quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, also 1969), and to make wide use of pop artists and songs in &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;. Because Barry provided not just the main title theme but the complete soundtrack score, his music often enhanced the critical reception of a film, notably in &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, &quot;The Tamarind Seed&quot;, the first remake of &quot;King Kong&quot; (1976), &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1985), and &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; (1990). Barry would often watch films and would note down with pen and paper what worked or what did not.

Barry composed the theme for the TV series &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; (1971), also known as &quot;The Unlucky Heroes&quot;, in which Tony Curtis and Roger Moore were paired as rich playboys solving crimes. The instrumental recording features the cimbalom (which Barry also used for &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; (1965) and other themes) and Moog synthesizers. The theme was a hit single in many European countries (including France, Germany, and the Benelux states), contributing to the cult status of the series in Europe, and the record featured Barry&#x27;s &quot;The Girl with the Sun in Her Hair&quot; on the B side, an instrumental piece featured in a long running TV advert for Sunsilk shampoo. Barry also wrote the scores to a number of musicals, including the 1965 &quot;Passion Flower Hotel&quot; (lyrics by Trevor Peacock), the successful 1974 West End show &quot;Billy&quot; (lyrics by Don Black), and two intended Broadway musicals that never opened on Broadway, &quot;Lolita, My Love&quot; (1971), with Alan Jay Lerner as lyricist, and &quot;The Little Prince and the Aviator&quot; (1981), again with lyricist Don Black. Barry also composed the soundtrack for the Bruce Lee film &quot;Game of Death&quot; (1978).

In 2001, the University of York conferred an honorary degree on Barry, and in 2002 he was named an Honorary Freeman of the City of York.

During 2006, Barry was the executive producer on an album entitled &quot;Here&#x27;s to the Heroes&quot; by the Australian ensemble The Ten Tenors. The album features a number of songs Barry wrote in collaboration with his lyricist friend, Don Black. Barry and Black also composed one of the songs on Shirley Bassey&#x27;s 2009 album, &quot;The Performance&quot;. The song, entitled &quot;Our Time Is Now&quot;, is the first written by the duo for Bassey since &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;.

===James Bond===
After the success of &quot;Dr. No&quot;, Barry was hired to compose and perform eleven of the next fourteen James Bond films.

In his tenure with the film series, Barry&#x27;s music, variously brassy and moody, achieved very wide appeal. For &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; he composed &quot;007&quot;, an alternative James Bond signature theme, which is featured in four other Bond films (&quot;Thunderball&quot;, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, and &quot;Moonraker&quot;. The theme &quot;Stalking&quot;, for the teaser sequence of &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, was covered by colleague Marvin Hamlisch for &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977). Barry also contributed indirectly to the soundtrack of the spoof version of &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967): his &quot;Born Free&quot; theme appears briefly in the opening sequence.

In &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), he perfected the &quot;Bond sound&quot;, a heady mixture of brass, jazz elements and sensuous melodies. There is even an element of Barry&#x27;s jazz roots in the big-band track &quot;Into Miami&quot;, which follows the title credits and accompanies the film&#x27;s iconic image of the camera lens zooming toward the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach. 

Barry&#x27;s love for the Russian romantic composers is often reflected in his music; in his Bond scores he unites this with brass-heavy jazz writing. His use of strings, lyricism, half-diminished chords and complex key shifting provides melancholy contrast; in his scores this is often heard in variations of the title songs that are used to underscore plot development.

As Barry matured, the Bond scores became more lushly melodic (along with other scores of his such as &quot;The Tamarind Seed&quot; and &quot;Out of Africa&quot;) as in &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979) and &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983). Barry&#x27;s score for &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; was traditional, but his collaboration with Duran Duran for the title song was contemporary and reached number one in the United States and number two in the UK Singles Chart. Both &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; and &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; theme by A-ha blended the pop music style of the bands with Barry&#x27;s orchestration. 
In 2006, A-ha&#x27;s Pal Waaktaar complimented Barry&#x27;s contributions: &quot;I loved the stuff he added to the track, I mean it gave it this really cool string arrangement. That&#x27;s when for me it started to sound like a Bond thing.&quot;

Barry&#x27;s last score for the Bond series was &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987), Timothy Dalton&#x27;s first film in the series, with Barry making a cameo appearance as a conductor in the film. Barry was intended to score &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; (1989) but was recovering from throat surgery at the time, and it was considered unsafe to fly him to London to complete the score. The score was completed by Michael Kamen.

David Arnold, a British composer, saw the result of two years&#x27; work in 1997 with the release of &quot;Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project&quot;, an album of new versions of the themes from various James Bond films. Arnold thanks Barry in the sleeve notes, referring to him as &quot;the Guvnor&quot;. Almost all of the tracks were Barry compositions, and the revision of his work met with his approval – he contacted Barbara Broccoli, producer of the then upcoming &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, to recommend Arnold as the film&#x27;s composer. Arnold also went on to score four subsequent Bond films: &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;.

Monty Norman, who was contracted as composer for &quot;Dr. No&quot;, received sole compositional credit for the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;. Nearly 40 years later, in 2001, the disputed authorship of the theme was examined legally in the High Court in London after Norman sued &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; for libel for publishing an article in 1997 in which Barry was named as the true composer; Barry testified for the defence.

In court, Barry testified that he had been handed a musical manuscript of a work by Norman (meant to become the theme) and that he was to arrange it musically, and that he composed additional music and arranged the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;. He also claimed that Norman received sole credit because of his prior contract with the producers. Barry said that a deal was struck whereby he would receive a flat fee of £250 and Norman would receive the songwriting credit. Barry said that he had accepted the deal with United Artists Head of Music Noel Rogers because it would help his career. Despite these claims, the jury ruled unanimously in favour of Norman.

On 7 September 2006, Barry reiterated his claim of authorship of the theme on the Steve Wright show on BBC Radio 2.

==Personal life and death==
Barry was married four times. His first three marriages, to Barbara Pickard (1959–63), Jane Birkin (1965–68) and Jane Sidey (1969–78) all ended in divorce. He was married to his fourth wife, Laurie, from January 1978 until his death. The couple had a son, Jonpatrick. Barry had three daughters: Suzanne with his first wife, Barbara; Kate with his second wife, Jane; and Sian, from a relationship with Ulla Larson between the first two marriages.

In 1975, Barry moved to the US. A British judge later accused him of emigrating to avoid paying £134,000 due the Inland Revenue. The matter was resolved in the late 1980s, and Barry was able to return to the UK. He subsequently lived for many years in the United States, mainly in Oyster Bay, New York, in Centre Island on Long Island, from 1980.

Barry suffered a rupture of the esophagus in 1988, following a toxic reaction to a health tonic he had consumed. The incident rendered him unable to work for two years and left him vulnerable to pneumonia.

Barry died of a heart attack on 30 January 2011 at his Oyster Bay home, aged 77. John is buried in Locust Valley Cemetery, Locust Valley, New York.

A memorial concert took place on 20 June 2011 at the Royal Albert Hall in London, where the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Shirley Bassey, Rumer, David Arnold, Wynne Evans and others performed Barry&#x27;s music. Sir George Martin, Sir Michael Parkinson, Don Black, Timothy Dalton and others also contributed to the celebration of his life and work. The event was sponsored by the Royal College of Music through a grant by the Broccoli Foundation.

==Awards and nominations==
In 1999, Barry was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to music. He received the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award in 2005.

<text>Hippety Hopper is a young kangaroo character in the Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series of cartoons. Robert McKimson introduced Hippety Hopper in &quot;Hop, Look and Listen&quot; (1948), which established the pattern for future Hippety Hopper cartoons. The character appeared in 14 theatrical cartoons between 1948 and 1964.

==History==
Hippety Hopper cartoons have a typical formula: Hopper escapes from a zoo, circus, etc., and is mistaken for a giant mouse by Sylvester the Cat. Frequently, Hopper changes places with an actual mouse, generally when it is most embarrassing for Sylvester. Sylvester tries to capture and eat his &quot;prey&quot;, but the innocent and infantile Hippety mistakes Sylvester&#x27;s predations for a game of rough-housing. Sylvester is repeatedly kicked, punched and spun around, but each failure only strengthens his desire to have the &quot;giant mouse&quot; for lunch. 

Hippety Hopper returns in McKimson&#x27;s &quot;Pop &#x27;Im Pop!&quot; (1950), in which proud father Sylvester boasts of his mousing skills to his son, Sylvester Jr. In &quot;Cats A-Weigh!&quot; (1953), Sylvester accepts a position as mouse-catcher on a ship. He encounters Hippety Hopper being shipped from Australia. Sylvester mistakes Hippety Hopper once again for a giant mouse and the baby kangaroo promptly beats the cat soundly. Junior is mortified, but the true victim is Sylvester, humiliated by a mere &quot;mouse&quot; in front of his own son.

McKimson would continue the Sylvester/Hippety Hopper series for 16 years, varying it slightly from cartoon to cartoon. In &quot;Bell Hoppy&quot; (1954), for example, in a twist on &quot;belling the cat&quot;, Sylvester must hang a bell around the neck of the biggest mouse that he can find in order to join the &quot;Loyal Order of Alley Cats Mouse and Chowder Club&quot;. Surprisingly, he actually &quot;succeeds&quot; this one time and gets to join the club, even becoming its Grand High Exalted Poobah, &quot;being the only active member&quot; (the other members were hit by the city zoo truck taking Hippety away to the zoo when they tried to catch him after Sylvester belled him).

In &quot;Lighthouse Mouse&quot;, Sylvester must guard a lighthouse from the baby kangaroo and a mouse who wants nothing more than to turn the lighthouse&#x27;s light off just so that he can get some sleep.

&quot;Hoppy Go Lucky&quot; (1952) was a parody of &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, with Sylvester accompanied by the giant, simple-minded cat &quot;Bennie&quot;, who wants a mouse &quot;to hug him and pet him&quot;. The central theme is always the same: Sylvester is shamed for his failure to capture what seems to be a simple &quot;mouse&quot;.

Hippety Hopper also appeared on records produced by Capitol Records and Golden Records. Unlike in the cartoons, Hippety actually spoke frequently on these, voiced by Mel Blanc using an Australian accent.

The Hippety Hopper/Sylvester/Sylvester Jr. cartoons ended in 1964 when the Warner Bros. studio closed its animation unit.

Originally Hippety Hopper intended to appear as a cameo in the film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988) in the deleted scene &quot;Acme&#x27;s Funeral&quot;.

<doc id="199624" wikidata="Q951726" url="?curid=199624" title="David Essex">
<text>David Essex (born David Albert Cook; 23 July 1947) is an English singer-songwriter and actor. From 1973 to 1994, he attained 19 Top 40 singles in the UK (including two number ones) and 16 Top 40 albums. Internationally, Essex had the most success with his 1973 single &quot;Rock On&quot;. 

He has also had an extensive career as an actor, which includes a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles for the film &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; (1973) and a nomination for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Musical for &quot;Evita&quot; in 1978.

==Early life==
Essex was born in Plaistow, Essex (now an area in the London Borough of Newham, included within Greater London) on 23 July 1947. His father, Albert, was an East End docker and his mother, Olive (née Kemp), was a self-taught pianist and an Irish Traveller. His grandfather, Thomas Kemp, was nicknamed &quot;Philimore&quot;, which was the anglicised version of &quot;Philly Mor&quot; – being Irish for &quot;Big Philly&quot;. Essex was two years old when his parents moved out of the overcrowded home the family was sharing with relatives, to Canning Town where he grew up.

Essex attended Star Lane Primary School. He loved playing football and did not answer any of the questions in the Eleven plus exam for entry into a grammar school, so that he could ensure he attended Shipman County Secondary School where he knew they played the game. He later attended The Warren secondary modern in Whalebone Lane, Chadwell Heath, when his parents moved to Marks Gate Estate. He was also a member of West Ham United Juniors for a while, and dreamed of one day being a professional player. He then also became interested in music and played drums with a local band (China Plates), before becoming a singer.

==Career==
===Early career===
Essex made his first record, titled &quot;And the Tears Came Tumbling Down&quot;, for the Fontana label in 1965. He then toured with a band called &#x27;David Essex and the Mood Indigo&#x27; for two years, and released a further seven singles in the 1960s. He also recorded two songs, &quot;A Rose&quot; and &quot;Leon and John and Billy and Me&quot; which remain unreleased, but exist as acetates. His first notable acting role, aside from small appearances in the films &quot;Assault&quot; and &quot;All Coppers Are...&quot;, was the lead in the stage musical &quot;Godspell&quot; in 1971 at the age of 23.

Two years later, he starred in the film &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; (1973) and recorded his international hit single, the self-penned &quot;Rock On&quot;, in the same year. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in March 1974. It was nominated for a Grammy and reached No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. A second single, &quot;Lamplight&quot;, also reached the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart.

In the 1970s, Essex emerged as a performer of some note. Contrary to a claim made in his own biography, his first concert was at the Granada in East Ham on Saturday 2 November 1974, and not at the Odeon. His biggest hits during this decade included two UK number one singles: &quot;Gonna Make You a Star&quot; (1974) and &quot;Hold Me Close&quot; (1975). He also appeared in &quot;Stardust&quot;, a 1974 sequel to &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;. The title song was another Top 10 hit. In 1976, Essex covered the Beatles song &quot;Yesterday&quot; for the musical documentary &quot;All This and World War II&quot;.

Essex&#x27;s pop idol looks gave him a strong female fan base, and his British tours created scenes of hysteria reminiscent of Beatlemania. According to &quot;The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles&quot;, he was voted the number one British male vocalist in 1974, and was a teen idol for more than a decade.

===Musical roles===
After a couple of years (from November 1971) playing the lead in &quot;Godspell&quot; in London, in December 1973 Essex appeared in the stage version of &quot;Tommy&quot; at London&#x27;s Rainbow Theatre.

In 1978, he appeared on Jeff Wayne&#x27;s musical version of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, as the Artilleryman. In the UK the two-record set remains a best-seller.

In the same year, Essex played the character Che in the original production of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical &quot;Evita&quot;, and his recording of the show&#x27;s &quot;Oh What a Circus&quot; reached number 3. As the best known of the principal performers, Essex actually received top billing, above Elaine Paige whose stardom seemingly arrived overnight with her casting in the show. His contract required him to remain with the show for just months during which, unusually and as Essex had predicted, his understudy, Nigel Planer, was never required to perform.

Two years later, he starred in the motorcycle racing film &quot;Silver Dream Racer&quot;; and the soundtrack song &quot;Silver Dream Machine&quot; was a top 5 hit in the UK Singles Chart. Essex, a keen motorcyclist, waived his fee for the then-new 1980 electric-start Triumph Bonneville he had contracted to advertise on behalf of the struggling Triumph motorcycle workers&#x27; co-operative.

In 1981, he starred in &quot;Childe Byron&quot;, a play staged at the Young Vic theatre.

In 1985, he co-wrote and starred as Fletcher Christian in the West End musical &quot;Mutiny!&quot;, based on the novel &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. The score produced two more hit singles, including &quot;Tahiti&quot;, his tenth Top 10 success.

In February 2016, Essex performed in &quot;The War Of The Worlds&quot; at London&#x27;s Dominion Theatre.

===Later career===
Essex continued to perform in all areas of show business. A 1988 sitcom, &quot;The River&quot;, achieved good ratings. In 1991, a music compilation entitled &quot;His Greatest Hits&quot; reached number 13; a 1993 album, &quot;Cover Shot&quot;, featuring a cover version of the Buzz Cason/Mac Gayden song &quot;Everlasting Love&quot;, peaked at number 3. His autobiography, &quot;A Charmed Life&quot;, was published in 2002, and became a best-seller.

In the 1999 New Year Honours, Essex was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) &quot;for charitable services, especially to Voluntary Service Overseas.&quot; He still tours the UK every year and releases albums through his website. Despite his long and successful British career, he remains largely unknown in the United States. &quot;Rock On&quot; reached Number 3 in 1974, and was his only US &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 40 hit single.

Essex, who comes from a family of Irish Travellers, played a kind-hearted nomad in one episode of ITV1&#x27;s 1960s Yorkshire-based drama &quot;Heartbeat&quot; in 2000. He played a character called Johnny Lee. Essex told Jake Bowers of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Rokker Radio&quot;, a programme for Gypsies and Travellers, on 30 July 2006, that he has always been openly proud of his Traveller family history. He was Patron of Britain&#x27;s National Gypsy Council, which works for equal rights, education, and services for Romany and Irish Travellers.

In 2005, he appeared as a guest vocalist on, and wrote songs for, Saint Etienne&#x27;s album &quot;Tales from Turnpike House&quot;. Also that year, he appeared in the Channel 4 documentary &quot;Bring Back...The Christmas Number One&quot;.

Essex was due to join the cast of soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, in early 2006, as new character Jack Edwards. However, the role was expanded beyond the three weeks planned, and Essex was unable to commit the time. The role instead went to Nicky Henson.

A model and recording of Essex is featured in the museum of West Ham United Football Club. In the recording, he explains his reasons for supporting West Ham and his love of the team.

Essex spent six years as an ambassador for Voluntary Service Overseas, which earned him an OBE in 1999.

===Recent years===
Essex used to record and release records on his own record label, Lamplight. He has since changed the name of his company to Joseph Webster Ltd, named after his first grandchild. He tours regularly and continues to act, appearing in &quot;Boogie Nights 2&quot;, &quot;Footloose&quot; and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical &quot;Aspects of Love&quot;. From September 2008 to the summer of 2009 he took his own musical, &quot;All the Fun of the Fair&quot;, on a tour of the United Kingdom. He followed this in the autumn with a sell-out solo tour of the UK, named the Secret Tour. Essex has released a DVD on his website of the last night of the tour, filmed in Bournemouth. He returned to London&#x27;s West End with &quot;All the Fun of the Fair&quot; but with a different ending from that performed in the provinces.

In January 2011, it was announced that Essex had finally joined the cast of &quot;EastEnders&quot; as Eddie Moon, five years after he was initially supposed to appear in the show. His first on-screen appearance was on 3 June 2011. Eddie left the square on 6 October 2011. He then wrote the music score for the film &quot;Traveller&quot; (2013), in which he co-starred with his son Billy Cook who played the main role as a half-gypsy trying to find his identity.

==Personal life==
On 20 September 2010, Essex married Welsh actress Susan Hallam-Wright (born 1973) his third wife, at St Cross Church, Talybont, near Bangor, North Wales. He first met her at the end of 2008 when she was auditioning for a role in &quot;All the Fun of the Fair&quot;. She got the part of Sally, then got promoted to the role of Mary, Jack&#x27;s girlfriend, for the West End version at the Garrick Theatre in London in April 2010. Essex had previously been married to Maureen Neal (in 1971) and Carlotta Christy (in 1997).

Essex has five children: two with his first wife, Maureen Neal; twins with his second wife, Carlotta Christy; and a fourth son with his third wife, Susan Hallam-Wright.

<doc id="199625" wikidata="Q308902" url="?curid=199625" title="Victoria (mythology)">
<text>In ancient Roman religion Victoria was the deified personification of victory. She first appeared during the first Punic War, seemingly as a Romanised re-naming of Nike, the goddess of victory associated with Rome&#x27;s Greek allies in the Greek mainland and in Magna Graecia. Thereafter she comes to symbolise Rome&#x27;s eventual hegemony and right to rule. She is a deified abstraction, entitled to a cult. But unlike Nike, she has virtually no mythology of her own.
== History and iconography ==
Victoria first appears during the first Punic War, as a translation or renaming of Nike, the Greek goddess of victory in peace or war. Nike would have become familiar to the Roman military as a goddess of Rome&#x27;s Greek allies in the Punic Wars. She was worshipped in Magna Graecia and mainland Greece, and was a subject of Greek myth. Around this time, various Roman war-deities begin to receive the epithet &quot;victor&quot; (conqueror) or &quot;invictus&quot; (unconquered). By the late republican and early imperial eras, Victoria had become a popular civilian and military goddess, both in association with other deities and in her own right. In 294 BC she was given a temple on the Palatine Hill. It was used to store war-booty, and it hosted the Magna Mater&#x27;s statue while her own temple was under construction. Victoria had several other shrines throughout Rome. In Imperial-era Timgad, &quot;victoria victrix&quot; (conquering victory) was given credit for Imperial successes.

Victoria&#x27;s coin images and cult images are probably based on an original cult image used in her temple. Her cult images show her in the attitude of a winged woman who steps forwards, supported on a globe, and holds aloft (or offers) a wreath or a palm-branch, not symbols of war but of triumph, and a peace that was consequent to victory. Other images show her as human-sized, driving a triumphal war-chariot, or in free-standing statuary, standing on the right-hand palm of a much larger figure, typically Rome&#x27;s supreme god, Jupiter, or war-god Mars, or Roma, divine personification of the Roman state.

The goddess Vica Pota is sometimes identified with Victoria, but is almost certainly too ancient for her iconography to have been influenced by Greek Nike, so is treated as a separate deity. Victoria is one of many Roman deities associated with the Sabine goddess Vacuna. 

With the ascendancy of Christianity, Rome&#x27;s religious affairs and institutions remained under the authority of the ruling emperor as &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, whether he was Christian or pagan. On the whole, Senates still respected, or at least allowed the performance of pagan sacrificial rites deemed essential to Rome&#x27;s well-being, including the sacrifice to Victoria at her Senate-house altar before every meeting. This had been an essential procedure ever since the altar had been given by Octavian, in 29 BC. In 379 the Christian emperor Gratian refused the post of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, and abolished state support of Rome&#x27;s traditional deities and rites. In 382 he had Victoria&#x27;s altar removed from her temple at the Curia Julia. They had been removed before, by Constantius II, and had been returned after protest. This time, despite widespread anger and anxietie, shared by officials at the highest level, they were not restored.

=== &quot;Winged Victories&quot; ===

Winged figures, very often in pairs, representing victory and referred to as winged victories, are common in Roman official iconography, typically hovering high in a composition, and often filling spaces in spandrels or other gaps in architecture. These represent the &quot;spirit of victory&quot; rather than a full-blown deity. Pairs of winged victories continued to appear after the Christianization of the Roman Empire and gradually evolved into depictions of Christian angels. A pair, facing inwards, fitted very conveniently into the spandrels of arches, and have been very common in Triumphal arches and similar designs where a circular element is framed by a rectangle.

<doc id="199627" wikidata="Q5492094" url="?curid=199627" title="Olin College">
<text>Olin College of Engineering, officially Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, is a private college focused on engineering and located in Needham, Massachusetts. Its endowment had been funded primarily by the defunct F. W. Olin Foundation. The college covers half of each admitted student&#x27;s tuition through the Olin Scholarship.

==History==

Olin College was founded by the F. W. Olin Foundation in 1997. The trustees were concerned about perpetuating Franklin W. Olin&#x27;s donor intent indefinitely, so the foundation&#x27;s president, Lawrence W. Milas, proposed creating a college. “We always had a bias toward supporting science and engineering schools because Mr. Olin was an engineer,” Milas said. “I was concerned with whether or not this would be consistent with what Mr. Olin had ever considered. I went back and read minutes of board meetings. And sure enough, in the late 1940s, at two or three board meetings shortly before his death, he expressed the idea of starting a new institution.”

By 2005, the foundation had donated most of its financial resources to the college, providing Olin with an endowment of about $460 million. Richard Miller was inaugurated as the college&#x27;s first president on May 3, 2003. Miller was also the first employee of Olin College, and had been working as its president for several years before he was officially inaugurated.

In a program known as Invention 2000, Olin College hired its first faculty members and invited 30 students, known as Olin Partners, to help it form a curriculum. The students lived in temporary housing and spent their first year after high school investigating assessment and grading methods, jump-starting the student culture, and experimenting with forms of engineering education.

Olin admitted its first full class of 75 students in 2002. This class included the Olin Partners, a group of deferred students known as the Virtual Olin Partners, and recent high school graduates. After admitting three more classes, the college reached its full size of approximately 300 students in fall 2005. It currently has about 390 students.

Olin&#x27;s campus was designed by the architecture firm Perry Dean Rogers Architects in the postmodern style. The first phase, comprising four buildings, was completed in 2002. The construction of a second dormitory, East Hall, was finished in fall 2005. Future plans include an academic building that would contain additional machine shops and project space. Olin shares many campus services, including health, public safety, and athletic facilities, with Babson College.

== Academics ==

===Teaching and learning===
Olin College offers degrees in electrical and computer engineering, mechanical engineering and engineering. Within the engineering program, students may concentrate in computing, design, biological engineering, materials science, or systems design, or they may design their own concentrations with the administration&#x27;s approval.

Unlike many institutions, Olin College does not have separate academic departments. All faculty members hold five-year renewable contracts without offering tenure.

Classes emphasize context and interdisciplinary connections. Freshmen take integrated course blocks that teach engineering, calculus, and physics by exploring the relationships among the three subjects. Arts, humanities, social sciences, and entrepreneurship courses take an interdisciplinary approach to subjects such as the self (&quot;What Is I?&quot;), history (&quot;History of Technology&quot;), and art (&quot;Wired Ensemble&quot; and &quot;Seeing and Hearing&quot;).

Olin also emphasizes practically grounded education, connecting concepts to real-world challenges and projects. Beginning in their first year, students receive training in Olin&#x27;s machine shop for project-based work. First-year students are required to take &quot;Design Nature&quot;, in which they design and build mechanical toys based on biological systems (such as the click beetle&#x27;s jumping mechanism). Classes often take a &quot;do-learn&quot; format, with the application of concepts being taught before the formal introduction of the underlying theory.

As part of its mission to redefine engineering education, Olin is continually undergoing curriculum reviews. The goal of these reviews is to ensure that the college maintains a culture of change and continuous improvement. Significant aspects of the curriculum—such as student assessment, course offerings, and student workload—are considered for detailed review yearly.

Much of Olin College&#x27;s curriculum is built around hands-on engineering and design projects. This project-based teaching begins in a student&#x27;s first year and culminates in two senior &quot;capstone&quot; projects. In the engineering capstone, student teams are hired by corporations, non-profit organizations, or entrepreneurial ventures for real-world engineering projects. In the Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship (ADE) capstone, students work on self-designed projects.

===Accreditation===
Olin College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education and the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.

== Admissions and financial aid ==

===Admissions===
Admissions to Olin College are selective, with, as of Fall 2022, 19% of applicants being admitted and the interquartile (middle 50%) of admitted students submitting scores under Olin College’s test-optional policy having SAT scores between 1500 and 1550 or ACT score of 35.

Admissions Office considers a student&#x27;s GPA to be a very important academic factor, with a very high emphasis on an applicant&#x27;s letters of recommendation, application essays, the rigor of academic record, and high school rank. In terms of non-academic materials as of 2022, Olin ranks extracurricular activities, the interview, talent/ability, and character/personal qualities as &#x27;very important&#x27; in making first-time, first-year admission decisions while ranking whether the applicant is a first-generation college applicant, legacy preferences, state and geographical residence as &#x27;considered&#x27;. Volunteer work, racial/ethnic status, and work experience are marked as &#x27;important&#x27;. The level of an applicant&#x27;s interest is highly accounted for in the admission decisions.

Olin College&#x27;s admission process is non-conventional and follows a two-step process. Applicants first apply for admission through the Common App, and all applications are reviewed in January. A holistic review process then carefully evaluates each applicant’s academic and personal qualities to determine whether they will advance to the second phase of the admission process. About 225–250 applicants are invited to participate in the second phase, Candidates’ Weekends, for them to learn more about the Olin community, curriculum, and culture. All applicants who reach the second phase of the process are required to participate in Candidates’ Weekends, as the information gleaned provides the basis for final admission decisions.

===Financial aid===
All accepted students receive the merit-based Olin Tuition Scholarship, which pays for half of the tuition and covers cross-registration of courses with Babson College, Wellesley College, and Brandeis University. Olin also shares clubs and intramural sports with those colleges. In addition to the Olin Scholarship, Olin follows need-blind admissions and provides need-based grants to meet each student&#x27;s full demonstrated need. Olin also allows students to receive funding and non-degree credit for &quot;passionate pursuits,&quot; personal projects that the college recognizes as having academic value.

It used to provide full-tuition scholarships, but in 2009, responding to a significant decline in the college&#x27;s endowment caused by the Great Recession, the trustees decided to reduce the merit scholarships to half-tuition for all students since the 2010–11 academic year.

==Student life==

===Dormitories and student housing===
Olin College houses students in dorms and suites in either the West Hall or the East Hall. Olin students are required to live on campus unless an exception is made by the dean of student life due to personal circumstances (e.g., for married students or students with families nearby). In addition, the Office of Student Life picks student &quot;resident resources&quot; (R2s) to fill the role traditionally played by resident assistants (RAs) at other schools. Unlike most RAs, R2s are not directly responsible for enforcing dorm policies.

===Honor code===
The Olin Honor Code has five clauses, titled &quot;Integrity&quot;, &quot;Respect for Others&quot;, &quot;Passion for the Welfare of Olin College&quot;, &quot;Openness to Change&quot;, and &quot;Do Something&quot;.

===Extracurricular activities===
Students can participate in clubs, community service projects, co-curricular activities with faculty and staff (which are noted on transcripts), and &quot;passionate pursuits&quot; (independent projects eligible for funding and/or non-degree credit).

Olin does not compete alone in the NCAA, and the regional NCAA conference—the New England Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s Athletic Conference—has not given approval for students to compete with Babson&#x27;s varsity teams. Olin students are, however, allowed to participate in club teams and non-NCAA sports at Babson, and the Babson women&#x27;s rugby team includes several Olin members. Olin has two soccer teams that compete through a Boston athletic organization, as well as an Ultimate team that competes in the BUDA league and the Ultimate Players Association. Additionally, students participate in Sunday morning football games, intramural sports, pick-up Ultimate games, the Student Martial Arts Club, a fencing club, and other athletic organizations.

===Mascot===
In 2002, the Olin Partners and Virtual Olin Partners selected the phoenix as the school&#x27;s mascot. The mascot, sometimes unofficially called Frank, represents Olin&#x27;s willingness to reinvent itself, just as the phoenix is reborn from its ashes. In 2013, Olin underwent a rebranding, and the original school colors, blue and silver, are now seen together only in the school seal and on diplomas. Everywhere else, the school now uses gradients of bright colors.

==Reputation and rankings==
In the 2022–2023 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; college rankings, Olin was ranked second for the best undergraduate engineering programs among non-doctorate-granting institutions in the United States.

, &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; ranked Olin College second for classroom experience, third for dormitories, third for amount of studying, fourth for student opinion of professors, fifth for ease of getting around campus, eighth for LGBT friendliness, 11th for financial aid, 11th for quality of life, 12th for science laboratory facilities, 17th for career services, and 19th for student happiness.

In 2006, Olin was selected by Kaplan, Inc. and &quot;Newsweek&quot; as one of &quot;America&#x27;s 25 New Ivies&quot;.

&quot;Business Insider&quot; ranked Olin first on its &quot;Best 20 College Campuses in the US&quot; list in 2014. It was eighth on Forbes&#x27;s &quot;Top 25 Colleges Ranked By SAT Score&quot;, with an average combined critical reading and math score of 1489.

==Media coverage==

In 2014, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; published an article that criticized the school for poor management of its endowment. The &quot;Globe&quot; pointed out that despite the abandonment of full-tuition scholarships, Olin&#x27;s spending remained relatively constant, and payroll costs rose 16% between 2009 and 2011. It also noted that Olin&#x27;s administrators received &quot;significantly more than the median salaries of executives in comparable positions&quot;, and that Moody&#x27;s had downgraded the institution&#x27;s bond rating. In an open letter to the Olin community, President Richard Miller defended the decisions of the administration and rebutted several of the points made in the article. The college successfully petitioned the &quot;Globe&quot; to release an official clarification, which stated that the article had &quot;failed to include the most recent financial information available&quot;. The &quot;Boston Business Journal&quot; also challenged the &quot;Globe&quot;&#x27;s assessment of Olin&#x27;s finances, reporting that revenue and enrollment had &quot;rebounded smartly&quot; in 2013 from recession lows.

<text>Evita is a musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. It concentrates on the life of Argentine political leader, activist and actress Eva Perón, the second wife of Argentine president Juan Perón. The story follows Evita&#x27;s early life, rise to power, charity work, and death.

The musical began as a rock opera concept album released in 1976. Its success led to productions in London&#x27;s West End in 1978, winning the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical at the 1978 Laurence Olivier Awards, and on Broadway a year later, where, at the 34th Tony Awards, it was the first British musical to receive the Tony Award for Best Musical.

This has been followed by a string of professional tours and worldwide productions and numerous cast albums, as well as a 1996 film adaptation. The musical was revived in London in 2006, and on Broadway in 2012, and toured the UK again in 2013–14 before running for 55 West End performances at the Dominion Theatre in September–October 2014.
==Synopsis==

Act I

On 26 July 1952, a crowd in a Buenos Aires, Argentina theatre is watching a movie (&quot;A Cinema in Buenos Aires, 26 July 1952&quot;) that is interrupted when news breaks of the death of First Lady Eva Perón. Both the crowd and the nation go into a period of public mourning (&quot;Requiem for Evita&quot;) as Che, a member of the public, marvels at the spectacle and promises to show how Eva did &quot;nothing for years&quot; (&quot;Oh What a Circus&quot;).

In 1934, 15-year-old Eva Duarte lives in the city of Junín, and longs to seek a better life in Buenos Aires. Eva takes up with a tango singer-songwriter, Agustín Magaldi, after she meets him at one of his shows (&quot;On This Night of a Thousand Stars&quot;). Eva persuades Magaldi to take her with him to Buenos Aires, and though he is initially resistant, he eventually accepts (&quot;Eva, Beware of the City&quot;). Upon her arrival in the city, Eva sings about her hopes and ambitions of glory as an actress (&quot;Buenos Aires&quot;).

After her arrival, Eva is quick to leave Magaldi, and Che relates how Eva sleeps her way up the social ladder, becoming a model, radio star, and actress (&quot;Goodnight and Thank You&quot;). He then tells of both a right-wing coup in 1943 and Eva&#x27;s success, implying that Argentine politics and Eva&#x27;s career may soon coincide. Che also makes a point to introduce the figure of Colonel Juan Domingo Perón, an ambitious military colonel who was making his way up the Argentine political ladder (&quot;The Lady&#x27;s Got Potential&quot;). In a game of musical chairs that represents the rise of political figures, Perón and other military figures compete for power and exhibit their political strategy (&quot;The Art of the Possible&quot;).

After a massive earthquake hits the town of San Juan, Perón organizes a charity concert at Luna Park to provide aid to the earthquake&#x27;s victims. Eva attends and briefly reunites with Agustín Magaldi, who coldly shuns her for her past actions. Perón addresses the crowd with words of encouragement and leaps off the stage, meeting Eva as soon as he exits (&quot;Charity Concert&quot;). Eva and Perón share a secret rendezvous following the charity concert, where Eva hints that she could help Perón rise to power (&quot;I&#x27;d Be Surprisingly Good For You&quot;). Eva dismisses Perón&#x27;s Mistress (the character is known only by that title), who ponders the rejection (&quot;Another Suitcase in Another Hall&quot;).

Upon moving in with Perón, Eva is introduced to high society only to be met with disdain from the upper classes and the Argentine Army (&quot;Perón&#x27;s Latest Flame&quot;). In 1946, after launching his presidential bid, Perón discusses his chances of winning the election with Eva. After reassuring him of their chances of winning, Eva organizes rallies for the &quot;descamisados&quot; and gives them hope for a better future while Perón and his allies plot to dispose of anyone who stands in their way (&quot;A New Argentina&quot;).

During the period between Act I and Act II, Eva and Perón are married – a fact merely alluded to, in the &quot;Casa Rosada balcony&quot; scene, at the start of Act II.

Act II

Perón is elected President in a sweeping victory in 1946. He stands &quot;On The Balcony of the Casa Rosada&quot; addressing his &quot;descamisados&quot; (shirtless ones). Eva speaks from the balcony of the Presidential Palace to her adoring supporters, where she reveals that despite her initial goal of achieving fame and glory, she has found her true calling to be the people of her country (&quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot;). Che analyses the price of fame as Eva dances at the Inaugural Ball with Perón, now the president-elect (&quot;High Flying, Adored&quot;).

Eva insists on a glamorous image to impress the people of Argentina and promote Peronism. She prepares to tour Europe as she is dressed for success by her fashion consultants (&quot;Rainbow High&quot;). Her famous 1946 tour meets with mixed results (&quot;Rainbow Tour&quot;); Spaniards adore her, but the Italians liken her husband to Benito Mussolini. France is impressed, and the British snub her by inviting her to a country estate, rather than Buckingham Palace. Eva affirms her disdain for the upper class, while Che asks her to start helping those in need as she made a promise (&quot;The Actress Hasn&#x27;t Learned the Lines (You&#x27;d Like to Hear)&quot;). Eva begins the Eva Perón Foundation to direct her charity work. Che describes Eva&#x27;s controversial charitable work and possible money laundering (&quot;And the Money Kept Rolling In (And Out)&quot;).

Eva appears at a church to take the sacrament in front of her adoring supporters (&quot;Santa Evita&quot;), but passes out suddenly, and while unconscious, appears to have a dream that reflects upon the conflicting views of her life. In her dream, she and Che heatedly debate her actions; Che accuses Eva of using the Argentine people for her own ends, while Eva cynically replies that there is no glory in trying to solve the world&#x27;s problems from the sidelines (&quot;Waltz for Eva and Che&quot;). At the end of the argument, Eva finally admits to herself and Che that she is dying and can&#x27;t go on for much longer. Che points out the disastrous results of Perón&#x27;s policies on Argentina: its treasury is bankrupt, its once-thriving beef industry is under rationing, and the press and other critics of the regime are muzzled.

Perón&#x27;s generals finally get sick of Eva&#x27;s meddling and demand that Perón force her to leave politics. However, Perón objects and claims that if it weren&#x27;t for her, they would never have achieved as much as they have (&quot;She Is a Diamond&quot;). But he also concedes that she won&#x27;t be able to keep working for long as she will soon succumb to her cancer. Even so, Eva is determined to run for Vice President, and Perón fears that the military will stage a coup if she runs and that Eva&#x27;s health is too delicate for any stressful work, but Eva insists that she can continue, despite her failing health (&quot;Dice Are Rolling/Eva&#x27;s Sonnet&quot;).

Realizing she is about to die, Eva renounces her pursuit of the vice presidency and swears her eternal love to the people of Argentina (&quot;Eva&#x27;s Final Broadcast&quot;). Eva&#x27;s numerous achievements flash before her eyes before she dies (&quot;Montage&quot;), and she asks for forgiveness, contemplating her choice of fame instead of long reign (&quot;Lament&quot;). Evita dies, and embalmers preserve her body forever. Che notes a monument was set to be built for Evita but says &quot;only the pedestal was completed, and Evita&#x27;s body disappeared for 17 years.&quot;

==History==

In 1972, Robert Stigwood proposed that Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice develop a new musical version of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, but abandoned the project.

Travelling late to a meal one night in 1973, though, Rice heard the end of a radio show about Eva Perón which intrigued him. As a child stamp collector, he had been fascinated by her image on the Argentine stamps, but was unaware of her significance in Argentina&#x27;s history. He began research and was introduced by a Cinema International Corporation executive to the Argentine film director Carlos Pasini Hansen who had produced the TV film &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot;, which had aired in the UK on 24 October 1972. The executive also arranged for Rice to see the film at Thames Television which he did &quot;at least twenty times&quot; saying also that &quot;by that time I had seen Pasini&#x27;s superbly researched film, I was hooked.&quot; The more Rice investigated Eva Perón, going so far as to travel to Buenos Aires to research her life with many documents and contacts that Pasini had supplied, the more fascinated he became by the woman; he even named his first daughter after her.

Rice suggested the idea of a musical based on the subject to Lloyd Webber, but although the idea of writing a score including tangos, paso dobles, and similar Latin flavours intrigued him, Lloyd Webber ultimately rejected the idea. He decided instead to collaborate with Alan Ayckbourn on &quot;Jeeves&quot;, a traditional Rodgers and Hart-style musical based on the P. G. Wodehouse character, which proved to be a critical and commercial failure. After &quot;Jeeves&quot;, Lloyd Webber returned to Rice, and they began developing Rice&#x27;s proposed musical.

The authors of the 1996 book &quot;Evita: The Real Life of Eva Perón&quot; claim the musical was based on Mary Main&#x27;s biography &quot;The Woman with the Whip&quot;, which was extremely critical of Eva Perón. Rice created the character &quot;Che&quot; to serve as both narrator and represent the voice of the lower, working class, providing insight and criticism to Eva&#x27;s character. When Harold Prince later became involved with the project, he insisted that the actors portraying Che should use Che Guevara as a role model. In the 1996 film adaptation, the character returned to his more anonymous roots. This was also the case for the 2006 London revival.

Lloyd Webber and the conductor Anthony Bowles presented the musical at the second Sydmonton Fest before making the recording with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.

==Recording==
As they had previously done with &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, the songwriting team decided to record &quot;Evita&quot; as an album musical and selected actress and singer Julie Covington to sing the title role, after having caught an episode of &quot;Rock Follies&quot; and remembered her from the original London production of &quot;Godspell&quot;. The recording, which was released by MCA Records who had previously marketed &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, commenced in April 1976 and was produced by Lloyd Webber and Rice. The recording was engineered by David Hamilton Smith, whose work Rice later acknowledged was effectively that of a third producer. He also delivered the line, &quot;Statesmanship is more than entertaining peasants,&quot; a rebuttal to Eva&#x27;s balcony speech on the album.

Released in 1976, the two-record set included Paul Jones as Juan Perón, Colm Wilkinson as Che, Barbara Dickson as Perón&#x27;s mistress, and Tony Christie as Agustín Magaldi. The writers had originally considered Steve Marriott and John Fogerty but neither was interested. Murray Head, who had enormous success with the &quot;Superstar&quot; album, recorded some demos but Rice later admitted they &quot;didn&#x27;t really reproduce the magic that his portrayal of Judas had.&quot; Colm Wilkinson had recently played Judas in the London production of &quot;Superstar&quot; and agreed to audition: &quot;It only took a couple of verses to know he was our man.&quot;

Mike d&#x27;Abo, who had succeeded Paul Jones as lead singer of Manfred Mann, had a minor role on the album which was notable as the first one which both had appeared. Mike Smith, former lead vocalist with the Dave Clark Five and d&#x27;Abo&#x27;s then working partner, also appeared.

Pasini wrote the dialogue in Spanish of the first scene, &quot;A Cinema in Buenos Aires, 26 July 1952&quot;. On this recording, he played the part of the actor in the soundtrack of a movie that grinds to a halt and also read the official communique of Eva&#x27;s death. When the album was presented to the press at Lloyd Webber&#x27;s country home Sydmonton, Pasini organised a photographic presentation with his colleague Anton Furst to accompany it. His contribution to the development of the project was recognised as Rice and Lloyd Webber acknowledged him first in a thank you speech afterwards.

In Britain, Australia, South Africa, South America, and various parts of Europe, sales of the concept album exceeded those of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;; in the United States, however, it never achieved the same level of success. Covington&#x27;s recording of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; (originally titled &quot;It&#x27;s Only Your Lover Returning&quot;) was released in October 1976. It reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart and enjoyed similar success internationally. Dickson&#x27;s &quot;Another Suitcase in Another Hall&quot; also became a hit. In the US and UK, respectively, Karen Carpenter, Olivia Newton-John, and Petula Clark released cover versions of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot;.

==Musical analysis==
The musical employs an eclectic range of styles. Classical music in &quot;Evita&quot; includes the opening choral piece (&quot;Requiem for Evita&quot;) and a choral interlude in &quot;Oh What a Circus&quot;, as well as instrumental passages throughout the musical such as the orchestral version of the &quot;Lament&quot; and the introduction to &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot;. Rhythmic Latinate styles are heard in pieces such as &quot;Buenos Aires&quot;, &quot;And the Money Kept Rolling in (And Out)&quot; and &quot;On This Night of a Thousand Stars&quot;, while ballads include &quot;High Flying, Adored&quot; and &quot;Another Suitcase in Another Hall&quot;. Rock music includes &quot;Oh What a Circus&quot;, &quot;Perón&#x27;s Latest Flame&quot;, and a song cut from the original production called &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Got Potential&quot;. The song was reinstated for the 1996 film with revised lyrics by Rice, and has also been used in Japanese, Czech, and Danish stage productions to expand on Argentine history for audiences less familiar with the subject.

==Historical accuracy==
Tomas Eloy Martinez noted:

The lyrics and storyline of the musical are influenced on Mary Main&#x27;s biography, &quot;Evita: The Woman with the Whip&quot;, which drew heavily upon the accounts of anti-Perónist Argentines. Shortly after the musical appeared, Nicholas Fraser and Marysa Navarro published a more neutral account of Eva Perón&#x27;s life, &quot;Evita: The Real Lives of Eva Perón&quot;, in which they claim that many of Main&#x27;s assertions were false, such as the suggestion that Eva had first gone to Buenos Aires as the mistress of a married musician, Agustín Magaldi. Instead, they wrote, Eva&#x27;s mother Doña Juana had taken her there when she aspired to become a radio actress. Some critics also suggested that Rice&#x27;s lyrics disparaged Evita&#x27;s achievements unnecessarily, particularly her charity work. According to Navarro and Fraser,Although [&quot;Evita&quot;] was based for the most part on the earliest and seamiest versions of Evita&#x27;s life, something happened to the tale in its retelling and the Evita who emerged each evening, dressed first as a teenager, then a hooker, and finally, in tulle and silver foil, as First Lady, was far from being unsympathetic.

Following the success of the film version of &quot;Evita&quot;, in 1996, an Argentinean film biography of Eva Perón was released, &quot;Eva Perón: The True Story&quot;, asserting that it corrected distortions in the musical&#x27;s account.

==Resident productions==

===Original West End production===
When the recording was released, Lloyd Webber had sent a copy to the American director Harold Prince and invited him to become involved with the eventual staging. Prince agreed, commenting, &quot;Any opera that begins with a funeral can&#x27;t be all bad&quot;, but he advised them that he could not take on any new commitments for the next two years. In the meantime, Lloyd Webber and Rice reworked several elements of the show. Some songs were dropped and some shortened, while others were introduced and some lyrics rewritten. Prince eventually confirmed that he would be ready to start rehearsals in early 1978. When he began working on the project in May, he suggested few changes, other than for deleting Che&#x27;s rock number &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Got Potential&quot;. Prince requested a song he could stage to chart Perón&#x27;s rise to power, and Rice and Lloyd Webber responded with the musical chairs number &quot;The Art of the Possible&quot;, during which military officers are eliminated until only Perón remains.

&quot;Evita&quot; opened at the Prince Edward Theatre on 21 June 1978 and closed on 8 February 1986, after 3,176 performances. Elaine Paige played Eva with David Essex as Che, Joss Ackland as Perón, Mark Ryan (actor) as Magaldi and Siobhán McCarthy as Mistress. Paige was selected from among many hopefuls, after Julie Covington declined the role. The production was directed by Harold Prince, choreographed by Larry Fuller, and produced by Robert Stigwood. Paige was succeeded by Marti Webb, Stephanie Lawrence, Siobhán McCarthy (who had played The Mistress when the show opened), Jacquey Chappell and ultimately, Kathryn Evans with Maria Morgan.

Webb originally played the role during Paige&#x27;s holiday and was persuaded by Prince to remain in the cast as an alternate for two shows each week to aid the transition when she took over the role. This set the precedent until the show closed, with Lawrence becoming Webb&#x27;s alternate. Michele Breeze, Paige&#x27;s original understudy never inherited the role in London but later created it for the original New Zealand production. Susannah Fellows also understudied Eva.

Gary Bond replaced David Essex as Che, then Mark Ryan, who had first starred as Magaldi, later assumed the role, followed by Martin Smith and Jimmy Kean. Ackland&#x27;s replacements included John Turner, Oz Clarke and Daniel Benzali.

In his review in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Derek Jewell called the show &quot;quite marvellous&quot; and described Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;ambitious&quot; score &quot;an unparallelled fusion of 20th century musical experience&quot; and Rice&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;trenchant&quot; and &quot;witty&quot;. Bernard Levin of &quot;The Times&quot; disliked it, however, calling it as an &quot;odious artefact ... that calls itself an opera ... merely because the clichés between the songs are sung rather than spoken&quot; and &quot;one of the most disagreeable evenings I have ever spent in my life&quot;.

This production won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical, and Elaine Paige won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Musical at the 1978 Laurence Olivier Awards. Also receiving Olivier Award nominations were Harold Prince (Best Director) and David Essex (Best Performance in a Musical).

Timothy O&#x27;Brien and Tazeena Firth collaborated on the design of the show. The set was minimal, with a scaffolded balcony running along the back and sides of the stage and images projected onto a screen above. Madame Tussauds produced a wax figurine of Eva, based on Elaine Paige, for the coffin during the funeral scene at the beginning of the show. Inspired by the murals of Diego Rivera, Prince suggested the proscenium be flanked by artwork depicting the struggles of the Argentine peasants. He jettisoned the original monochromatic costumes designed for the chorus members and dancers; instead, he had them go to charity and secondhand clothing shops to purchase costumes. The now iconic balcony scene featured Eva in a broad, diamond encrusted white dress based on one actually owned by Eva Perón which had been designed by Christian Dior addressing a crowd from the rear balcony of the stage.

The &quot;Evita: Original London Cast Recording&quot; was recorded in 1978 and released by MCA Records. Some releases mistakenly refer to the concept album as the Original London Cast Recording.

The original London production transferred to the Opera House in Manchester for an extended run following its closure at the Prince Edward Theatre. Kathryn Evans and Jimmy Kean played Eva and Che with Ria Jones and John Barr being their alternates.

===Original Broadway production===

After debuting at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, with a subsequent engagement at the Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco, the Broadway production opened at the Broadway Theatre on 25 September 1979 and closed on 26 June 1983, after 1,567 performances and 17 previews. Patti LuPone starred as Eva, with Mandy Patinkin as Che, Bob Gunton as Perón, Mark Syers as Magaldi, and Jane Ohringer as Perón&#x27;s mistress. Harold Prince directed with choreography by Larry Fuller. During the run, six actresses alternated playing the title role, in addition to LuPone: Terri Klausner (matinees), Nancy Opel (matinees), Pamela Blake (matinees), Derin Altay, Loni Ackerman and Florence Lacey. Patinkin was replaced by James Stein and later by Anthony Crivello. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Frank Rich stated: &quot;Loni Ackerman, the current Eva Perón, has no discernible Latin blood, but she sings the role better than any of the American Evitas, as well as acting and dancing it with nonstop energy. Anthony Crivello, a performer new to me, is easily the best Che I&#x27;ve seen in New York or London: not only does he have a supple voice, but he also moves with such grace that he lightens the heavy, moralizing tone his character must bear. He&#x27;s so effective, in fact, that he almost convinces you that there&#x27;s a sound reason for Che Guevara to be dragged into the Peron saga.&quot; Tom Carter understudied Patinkin and performed as Che.

LuPone has stated about her time in the show: &quot;&quot;Evita&quot; was the worst experience of my life,&#x27; she said. &#x27;I was screaming my way through a part that could only have been written by a man who hates women. And I had no support from the producers, who wanted a star performance onstage but treated me as an unknown backstage. It was like Beirut, and I fought like a banshee.&#x27;&quot;

Elaine Paige was originally told she would re-create her role in the Broadway production, however the Actors&#x27; Equity Association refused permission for a non-American. Prince attempted to persuade the organisation for a second time when LuPone was suffering vocal problems before the production reached New York. LuPone stated in her memoir that this was nothing more than a rumour started by Prince himself to build publicity. She, however, had her own doubts about that being true.

=== Original Australian production ===
The original Australian production opened at the Adelaide Festival Theatre on 30 April 1980. It featured Jennifer Murphy as Eva, John O&#x27;May as Che, Peter Carroll as Perón, Tony Alvarez as Magaldi, and Laura Mitchell as Perón&#x27;s mistress. Patti LuPone took over the title role in mid-1981 during its Sydney run after Murphy left the production. LuPone&#x27;s experience in the Sydney production was a much more positive one than her time on Broadway because by that time she felt comfortable singing the score and enjoyed playing the part.

===Original Madrid production===
The first Spanish language version premiered at the Teatro Monumental in Madrid on 23 December 1980, directed by Jaime Azpilicueta and with Paloma San Basilio as Eva, Patxi Andión as Che, Julio Catania as Perón, Tony Landa as Magaldi and Montserrat Vega as Perón&#x27;s mistress. A double album recorded by the original cast was released and the song &quot;No llores por mí Argentina&quot; became a hit single. This production later played in Barcelona and in other cities in Latin America.

===Original Mexican production===
In Mexico City the show premiered at the Teatro Ferrocarrilero on 26 June 1981, with Valeria Lynch and Rocío Banquells alternating as Eva, Jaime Garza and Javier Díaz Dueñas alternating as Che, Jorge Pais as Perón, César Millán as Magaldi and Carmen Delgado as Perón&#x27;s mistress.

===Original Brazilian production===
Directed by Maurício Shermann and starring Cláudia as Evita, Mauro Mendonça as Péron, Carlos Augusto Strazzer as Che, Sílvia Massari as Perón&#x27;s mistress, and Hildon Prado as Magaldi, it premiered at Teatro João Caetano in Rio de Janeiro on 12 January 1983. It later moved to Teatro Palace in São Paulo in 1986. It opened to great success in Brazil, with the Brazilian singer Cláudia being considered by some critics as the best Evita of all the time. English producers Robert Stigwood and David Land, after watching the Brazilian production, said that Cláudia was the best Evita of all the singers who had played the role.

===2006 West End revival===
On 2 June 2006, the first major London production of &quot;Evita&quot; since the original had closed 20 years earlier opened in the West End at the Adelphi Theatre. Directed by Michael Grandage, Argentine actress Elena Roger debuted as Eva, while Philip Quast appeared as Perón with Matt Rawle as Che. Its libretto included &quot;You Must Love Me&quot;, written for the 1996 film, but which had not yet been included in an English-language stage production. The production opened to very positive reviews, but ticket sales were slow, which resulted in its closure on 26 May 2007 after a run of less than a year. Quast and Roger were nominated for Best Actor in a Musical and Best Actress in a Musical respectively for their performances at the 2007 Laurence Olivier Awards.

===2010 Stratford Shakespeare Festival===
The Stratford Shakespeare Festival produced &quot;Evita&quot; as its first rock musical from 28 to 6 May November 2010. The principal characters are played by Chilina Kennedy (Eva), Juan Chioran (Juan), and Josh Young (Che), with direction by Gary Griffin.

===2012 Broadway revival===
A Broadway revival of the show, based upon the 2006 West End production, ran at the Marquis Theatre, with Elena Roger in the title role, Ricky Martin as Che, Michael Cerveris as Perón, Max von Essen as Magaldi (he was also Ricky Martin&#x27;s understudy) and Rachel Potter as Mistress. Christina DeCicco alternated with Roger as Eva. Michael Grandage again directed the production with choreography by Rob Ashford, set and costume design by Christopher Oram and lighting design by Neil Austin. The revival was produced by Hal Luftig and Scott Sanders. Previews began on 12 March 2012 with the official opening on 5 April 2012. The production was nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical at the 66th Tony Awards. It closed on 26 January 2013 after 337 performances and 26 previews.

===2013 Italian production===
The first Italian production premiered in Sanremo (IM) 5 December 2013, directed by Susanna Tagliapietra, with Italian lyrics by Marco Savatteri. The original cast included Simona Angioloni as Eva Duarte, Edoardo Pallanca as Che, Agostino Marafioti as Juan Perón, Matteo Merli as Magaldi, Diletta Mangolini as Mistress, replaced by Simona Marrocco in the touring production.

=== 2017 Israeli production ===
Israeli singer and actress Shiri Maimon starred in a production of &quot;Evita&quot; at Habima Theatre in Tel Aviv in 2017. Broadway producers impressed by her performance later invited her to star in &quot;Chicago&quot; on Broadway. In 2024, Maimon recorded a Hebrew rendition of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; (אל נא תבכי ארגנטינה) accompanied by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.

===2025 West End Revival===
A West End revival is scheduled to run at the London Palladium from 14 June - 6 September 2025. Jamie Lloyd is expected to be the director. Casting is yet to be announced.

The production starred Samantha Pauly in her London debut as Eva, Ektor Rivera as Juan Peron, Trent Saunders as Che, Adam Pearce as Magaldi, and Frances Mayli McCann as the Mistress.

New York City Center also presented the musical in 2019, (directed by Sammi Cannold) from 13 – 24 November 2019. The musical opened to mixed reviews, and featured two actresses in the role of Eva. Maia Reficco as young Eva from 15–20, and Solea Pfeiffer from 20–33. Jason Gotay starred as Che, with Enrique Acevedo as Juan and Philip Hernández as Magaldi.

Cannold again directed the musical at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts from May-July 2023 with Shereen Pimentel in the title role with Omar Lopez-Cepero as Che, Caesar Samayoa as Juan, and Gabriel Burrafato as Magaldi.

An all-star West End concert was performed at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in July and August 2023, directed by Bill Deamer, starring Auli&#x27;i Cravalho as Eva, alongside Matt Rawle reprising his role of Che from the first West End revival and Jeremy Secomb reprising his role of Juan from the 2017 Europe tour. The concert featured a 30-piece orchestra and was produced by Fourth Wall Live and the London Musical Theatre Orchestra.

==Touring productions==
There have been numerous US and international touring productions of the show:

===Early 1980s US national tours===

The 1980–1983 1st US national tour opened at the Shubert Theatre in Los Angeles and starred Loni Ackerman as Eva, Scott Holmes as Che, Jon Cypher as Juan Perón, Sal Mistretta as Magaldi and Cynthia Hunt as Perón&#x27;s Mistress. The 1979-1983 2nd US national tour opened at the Shubert Theatre in Chicago and subsequently toured to major U.S. cities starring Valerie Perri as Eva, John Herrera as Che, Robb Alton as Juan Perón, Peter Marinos as Magaldi and Cynthia Simpson as Perón&#x27;s Mistress. The 2nd National went on to finish touring Scandinavia. The 1984 3rd US National Tour opened at the Masonic Temple Theatre in Detroit and starred Florence Lacey as Eva, Tim Bowman as Che, John Leslie Wolfe as Juan Perón, Vincent Pirillo as Magaldi and Patricia Ludd as Perón&#x27;s Mistress. In the 1983 and 1986 US tours, Florence Lacey played Eva.

===1987 UK and Irish Tour===

Rebecca Storm played Eva with Chris Corcoran as Che.

===1988 European Tour===
Rebecca (Becky) Norman played Eva with James Sbano as Che and David Wasson as Perón with performances in Italy, Holland and Germany.

===1989 World Tour===

Florence Lacey starred once more with James Sbano as Che and Robert Alton as Perón.

===1992-1994 US Tour===

A touring production was mounted in anticipation of the film version which lasted nearly two years and featured several actresses in the title role, including Valerie Perri, Donna Marie Asbury and Marla Schaffel. It was directed and choreographed by Larry Fuller and featured John Herrera and Daniel C. Cooney as Che.

===1995–1996 UK Tour===

Paul Nicholas and David Ian, with the original producers Robert Stigwood and David Land, mounted a version closely based on the original London production starring Marti Webb, one of the first performers to play Eva, with Chris Corcoran as Che, Duncan Smith as Perón, Leo Andrew as Magaldi and Poppy Tierney as the mistress. Despite some criticism over the casting of Webb at the age of 50, the success of the tour led to extensions throughout 1996.

===1998 US 20th Anniversary Tour===

A tour, based on the original Broadway production, which was originally scheduled to play on Broadway in the 1999–2000 season started in Detroit on 3 November 1998 and closed in Boston, Massachusetts, in the summer of 1999. It starred Natalie Toro as Eva, with Raul Esparza as Che and Raymond Jaramillo McLeod as Juan Perón. This production focused more on Latin themes. According to &quot;Playbill&quot;, &quot;The Latin casting is part of an effort to instill this production with a more culturally authentic feel.&quot; Toro received excellent reviews, along with her leading men.

===2004 US Tour===

A production opened in November 2004 with Kathy Voytko and Bradley Dean, directed by Harold Prince and Larry Fuller. This production closed in May 2007 but reopened later that year. It closed finally in June 2008.

===2008 UK Tour===

A tour, following the then recent London production, began in 2008 starring Louise Dearman and later Rachael Wooding as Eva, Seamus Cullen (a finalist in the BBC show &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot;) as Che, Mark Heenehan as Perón with James Waud as Magaldi who won the role in a competition, and Nikki Mae as Perón&#x27;s Mistress, later Carly Bowmen. The UK tour ended in late 2009 but was remounted in March 2010, touring throughout Europe until April 2011. It continued in the UK and Germany from May to September 2011 featuring Abigail Jaye as Eva, Mark Powell as Che, Mark Heenehan as Perón and Reuben Kaye as Magaldi. Earl Carpenter would later replace Heenehan.

===2013 US Tour===

A US national tour of the musical, based on the 2012 Broadway revival, began in September 2013. The cast for the tour included Caroline Bowman as Eva, Josh Young as Che, Sean McLaughlin as Perón, Christopher Johnstone as Magaldi, Krystina Alabado as Mistress and Desi Oakley as the alternate for Eva Perón.

===2013–2014 UK Tour===

A tour, announced after the success of the Broadway production of the show, which was produced by Bill Kenwright. It opened on 15 May 2013 at the New Wimbledon Theatre, before dates at the Glasgow Kings Theatre, Theatre Royal Norwich, and the Wolverhampton Grand. The production starred Marti Pellow, the lead singer of the band Wet Wet Wet, as Che, Andrew C Wadsworth as Juan Perón, and Madalena Alberto as Eva Perón. The tour concluded with 55 performances at the Dominion Theatre in the West End in September and October 2014. This production was directed by Bob Thompson, with choreography by Bill Deamer, and musical direction by David Steadman.

Led by Emma Hatton, with Gian Marco Schiaretti as Che; Jeremy Secomb as Juan Perón; Oscar Balmaseda as Magaldi and Sarah O’Connor as the Mistress; this production ran through to July. In the same way the previous tour had a limited London run, this production performed a limited 91 performance run (due to the failure of &quot;The Girls&quot;) at the Phoenix Theatre from July to October 2017. Hatton reprised her role along with all her previous cast members. The tour then continued into 2018.

===2017/2018 International Tour===

A revival of the original production (as directed by Hal Prince and choreographed by Larry Fuller) toured South Africa, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, featuring a cast from South Africa and led by Emma Kingston from the UK in the title role.

The Singapore season ran from 23 February 2018 to 18 March 2018 in the Marina Bay Sands Theatre. 18 young talents were selected to be cast in this &quot;Evita&quot; production. Three sets of six children alternate in ensemble roles. The young actors are: Federica Aramburu, Lilo Baier, Mika Barel, Charmaine Chan, Hindya Dickinson, Jasmine Huilian Ellis, Gabriel Frade, Sam Howie, Annabelle Jarvis, Jayden Alim Lai, Lia Marie Elaine Macdonell, Max Makatsaria, Nanako Masui, Faith Ong, Sofia Ella Poston, Sebastian Street, Damien Rocco Weber, Charisse Low Yu Xin.

===2018 Australian Tour===

A 2018 Australian revival of the stage musical, directed by Harold Prince, was announced on 21 August 2017, by Opera Australia, with Australian singer-songwriter, musician, musical theatre actress Tina Arena being confirmed as the lead actress. The stage tour production began at the Sydney Opera House, in the Joan Sutherland Theatre, with opening night on 13 September, running to 3 November 2018. The next venue on the national tour leg was the Arts Centre Melbourne, from 5–30 December 2018. Arena said she felt the time was right to tackle the role. &quot;I have been approached to do this role on a couple of occasions,&quot; Arena stated. &quot;I never felt emotionally ready for it. I felt I had a lot of living and learning before I could get up and take on the enormity of the story and the human spirit she possessed&quot;.

On 7 May 2018, Opera Australia Artistic Director Lyndon Terracini, along with producers John Frost and David Ian, announced the full cast for the upcoming Australian production of &quot;Evita&quot;. With Arena announced in the lead role as Eva Perón, the remainder of the cast was announced as: Paulo Szot, Brazilian operatic baritone in the role of Juan Perón; Kurt Kansley would take on the role of the revolutionary Che. Michael Falzon would portray tango singer Agustín Magaldi, while the role of Perón&#x27;s Mistress would be played by Alexis van Maanen. Jemma Rix was cast as the alternate Eva Perón and was scheduled to be appearing in the role at least once a week (the Wednesday 7:30 pm show) throughout the Sydney season, according to the &quot;Evita&quot;-Australia website.

On 21 July 2018, Opera Australia Artistic Director Lyndon Terracini, along with producers John Frost and David Ian, announced the 18 young performers who have been cast in the upcoming production of &quot;Evita&quot;, in season at the Sydney Opera House from September 2018. Three sets of six children alternated in ensemble roles.

==Film adaptation==

Plans for a film directed by Ken Russell developed soon after the West End and Broadway openings. Much speculation of potential leads included Barbra Streisand or Liza Minnelli as Eva, and Barry Gibb or Elton John as Che. These plans never came to fruition.

Russell has said that his own first choice for the film lead was Karla DeVito, who had come to fame in rock tours and on Broadway, where she had impressed the wife of Andrew Lloyd Webber. DeVito was screen tested for the role while in England shooting music videos for her solo album &quot;Is This A Cool World or What?&quot; DeVito&#x27;s performance of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry For Me Argentina&quot; in the screen test caused much positive buzz. Russell wrote that she brought viewers to tears (except Tim Rice – who wanted Elaine Paige, with whom he was romantically involved). Although Russell rejected the idea, Paige was screen tested twice.

Russell&#x27;s biography indicates that he met with Barbra Streisand, who dismissed the role immediately. He wrote that he then suggested Liza Minnelli. A year had passed between the first screen tests and Minnelli&#x27;s, which Russell reports was amazing. Russell approached Stigwood with Minnelli&#x27;s test, convinced she had the necessary talent and star quality, but he was soon told it was going to be Elaine Paige. Having already protested that idea, Russell quit the film. Years later when he saw Karla DeVito again, Russell addressed her as &quot;My Evita.&quot;

It was not until 1996 that &quot;Evita&quot; came to the big screen. Alan Parker directed the film, with Madonna in the title role, Antonio Banderas as Che and Jonathan Pryce as Perón. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning one for Best Original Song (&quot;You Must Love Me,&quot; composed especially for the film) at the 69th Academy Awards. Madonna received mixed reviews but won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her performance at the 54th Golden Globe Awards, where the film also won Best Picture–Musical or Comedy. The film was choreographed by Vincent Paterson.

==Cultural impact==
&quot;Evita&quot; came in sixth in a BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the UK&#x27;s &quot;Number One Essential Musicals&quot;.

One episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The President Wore Pearls&quot;, has a plot loosely based on the musical, with Lisa Simpson (Yeardley Smith) in Eva&#x27;s role. The episode includes parodies of songs such as &quot;A Vote for a Winner&quot; which includes the lyrics, &quot;don&#x27;t cry for me, kids of Springfield&quot;. At the end of the episode, a comical disclaimer is displayed stating, &quot;On the advice of our lawyers, we swear we have never heard of a musical based on the life of Eva Perón&quot;.

During the &quot;Glee&quot; episode &quot;Special Education&quot;, the characters Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) and Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) sing &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; when Kurt is auditioning for a solo in the Warblers for Sectionals. In the season three episode &quot;Hold On to Sixteen&quot;, a rival showchoir sings &quot;Buenos Aires&quot; as their competition piece.

In the short &quot;The Ballad of Magellan&quot; in the cartoon series &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, the country of Argentina is depicted with a sign reading, &quot;&quot;EVITA&quot; Coming Soon!&quot;.

==Recordings==

First recorded by a cast assembled specifically for the recording in 1976, the first stage cast recording of &quot;Evita&quot; was of the original London production in 1978. The original Broadway cast was recorded for an album released in 1979. Lloyd Webber and Rice produced these first three recordings.

At least 25 English language cast albums have been released, along with many foreign language recordings. There are currently four in Spanish, five German, three in Japanese, and two in Hebrew, with additional recordings in Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, Hungarian, Icelandic, Korean, Portuguese, and Swedish.

Soprano Kiri Te Kanawa recorded a complete operatic version of the score with Christopher Lee as Perón. This recording, however, has never been released. Marti Webb also recorded a highlights album of sorts for the Pickwick Records label that featured Dave Willetts and Carl Wayne. It was released to coincide with the 1995 UK Tour of the show in which Webb starred.

<text>Pop-punk (also punk-pop, alternatively spelled without the hyphen) is a rock music fusion genre that combines elements of punk rock with power pop or pop. It is defined by its fast-paced, energetic tempos, and emphasis on classic pop songcraft, as well as adolescent and anti-suburbia themes. It is distinguished from other punk-variant genres by drawing more heavily from 1960s bands such as the Beatles, the Kinks, and the Beach Boys. The genre has evolved throughout its history, absorbing elements from new wave, college rock, ska, hip hop, emo, boy band pop and even hardcore punk and metalcore. It is sometimes considered interchangeable with power pop and skate punk.

Pop-punk emerged in the late 1970s with groups such as the Ramones, the Undertones, and the Buzzcocks setting the genre&#x27;s groundwork. 1980s punk bands like Bad Religion, Descendents and the Misfits, while not necessarily pop-punk in and of themselves, were influential to pop-punk, and it expanded in the late 1980s and early 1990s by a host of bands signed to Lookout! Records, including Screeching Weasel, the Queers, and the Mr. T Experience. In the mid-1990s, the genre saw a widespread popularity increase and entered the mainstream with bands like Green Day and the Offspring. The genre experienced another wave popularized during the late 1990s and early 2000s led by Blink-182, and in their wake followed contemporary acts such as Sum 41, New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, and Avril Lavigne, while the Warped Tour played a crucial role in launching up-and-coming pop-punk artists.

Pop-punk&#x27;s mainstream popularity continued in the mid-to-late 2000s, with artists such as Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, and Paramore achieving high levels of commercial success. By this point, pop-punk acts were largely indistinguishable from artists tagged as &quot;emo&quot;, to the extent that emo crossover acts such as Fall Out Boy and Paramore popularized a pop-punk-influenced style dubbed emo pop. By the 2010s, pop-punk&#x27;s mainstream popularity had waned, with rock bands and guitar-centric music becoming rare on dance-focused pop radio. During this period, however, a wave of underground artists defined a rawer and more emotional take on the genre, namely the Story so Far, the Wonder Years and Neck Deep. In the early 2020s, a new crop of pop-punk music began experiencing mainstream resurgence with various new acts such as Machine Gun Kelly, KennyHoopla and Yungblud.

== Definition and characteristics ==
Pop-punk is variously described as a punk subgenre, a variation of punk, a form of pop music, and a genre antithetical to punk in a similar manner as post-punk. It has evolved stylistically throughout its history, absorbing elements from new wave, college rock, ska, rap, emo, and boy bands. Some variations of pop-punk are noted for their faithfulness to traditional punk rock, employing a &quot;raw, gritty, screamy, and not necessarily radio-friendly&quot; sound. Other variants are more polished and suitable for mainstream radio.

Writers at &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described pop-punk as a punk subgenre that has &quot;essentially been around as long as punk itself&quot; with roots in the &quot;classic pop of the Beatles, the Kinks, and the Beach Boys, often pitting sweet harmonies against bratty, rowdy riffs.&quot; According to Ryan Cooper of About.com, &quot;pop-punk is a style that owes more to The Beatles and &#x27;60s pop than other sub-genres of punk&quot;.

There is considerable overlap between power pop and pop-punk, and the two styles are often conflated. Web publication &quot;Revolver&quot; acknowledged that, while pop-punk and power pop are often presented interchangeably, &quot;the core concept is simple—melodic songs packaged with a punk slant.&quot; In Brian Cogan&#x27;s &quot;The Encyclopedia of Punk Music and Culture&quot; (2006) pop-punk is characterized as &quot;a catchy, faster version of power pop.&quot; AllMusic defines &quot;punk-pop&quot; as &quot;a post-grunge strand of alternative rock&quot; that combines the textures and fast tempos of punk rock with the &quot;melodies and chord changes&quot; of power pop. In the 1990s, there was overlap between pop-punk and skate punk. Music journalist Ben Myers wrote that the two terms were synonymous.

Rock writer Greg Shaw, who wrote extensively about power pop and took credit for codifying the genre in the 1970s, originally defined power pop itself as a hybrid style of punk and pop. Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong, who described power pop as &quot;the greatest music on Earth that no one likes&quot;, opined that the pop-punk term was an oxymoron: &quot;You&#x27;re either punk or you&#x27;re not.&quot; Writing in &quot;Shake Some Action: The Ultimate Guide to Power Pop&quot; (2007), actor Robbie Rist felt that much of the genre merely consisted of pop bands who &quot;add the &#x27;punk&#x27; moniker so the kids will think they are pissing off their parents.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, in an article about pop-punk, wrote that the term was a retroactive label for punk bands who had &quot;always championed great songwriting alongside their anti-authoritarian stance. And punk&#x27;s focus on speed, concision and three-chord simplicity is a natural fit with pop&#x27;s core values.&quot; &quot;Vice&quot;″s Jason Heller described &quot;an open respect for the tradition and craft of pop songwriting&quot; as a key characteristic of pop-punk. Bill Lamb, also from About.com, writes that pop-punk is a variant of punk music that features &quot;a hard and fast guitar and drums base but powered by pop melodies like much of &#x27;70s punk rock.&quot; &quot;Alter the Press!&quot; defines pop-punk as &quot;a genre that originates from mixing punk rock with pop sensibility&quot;.

Lyrically, pop-punk often addresses adolescent themes of lust, romantic relationships, heartbreak, drugs, suburbia, and rebellion. Some pop-punk lyrics make an emphasis on jokes and humor. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Amanda Petrush summarized that the &quot;rawness&quot; of pop-punk &quot;lies not in the music&quot; but by conveying the &quot;spectrum of human experience, all that longing and self-doubt.&quot;

== History ==
===Origins (1970s–1980s)===

The term pop punk was first used by John Rockwell in a New York Times in March 1977 article to describe Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.

Punk rock has long shared sensibilities with pop music, especially since the late 1970s. In his book &quot;Rock and Roll: A Social History&quot; (2018), author Paul Friedlander lists the following English artists as representative of the &quot;new wave of pop punk synthesis&quot; that occurred in the late 1970s: Elvis Costello and the Attractions, the Police, the Jam, Billy Idol, Joe Jackson, the Pretenders, UB40, Madness, the Specials, the English Beat. Likewise, among American acts, Friedlander references Talking Heads, Blondie, the B-52s, the Motels, and Pere Ubu.
Heller said that the Ramones crafted a blueprint for pop-punk with their 1976 debut album, but 1978 was the year that the genre &quot;came into its own&quot;. He noted that some bands &quot;were unmistakably pop punk bands by today&#x27;s definition of the term, but in 1978, the distinction wasn&#x27;t so clear. Plenty of punk groups of the era threw a token pop tune or two into their set—sometimes for ironic effect, other times earnestly.&quot; Heller also acknowledged that many &quot;burgeoning pop punk groups in 1978 bordered on power pop, a parallel genre on the rise at the time. But power pop began earlier, and it was a more American phenomenon&quot;. Among the influential pop-punk bands of the late 1970s were the Buzzcocks. An &quot;LA Weekly&quot; writer later referred to the band&#x27;s 1979 compilation album &quot;Singles Going Steady&quot; as &quot;the blueprint for punk rock bands preferring tuneful tales of lost love and longing to rage against the machine.&quot; Cooper similarly cited the album as one of punk&#x27;s most influential and added that Buzzcocks&#x27; &quot;pop overtones [led] them to be a primary influence on today&#x27;s pop punk bands.&quot;. Heller referred to the Undertones as &quot;the most subversive band&quot; of the genre during this period, particularly their 1978 single &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot;, &quot;one of the most striking and definitive pop punk classics.&quot;
Bad Religion, formed in 1979, helped to lay the groundwork for the pop-punk style that emerged in the 1990s. They and some of the other leading bands in Southern California&#x27;s hardcore punk scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to Myers, Bad Religion &quot;layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies&quot;. Myers added that another band, the Descendents, &quot;wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys-inspired songs about girls and food and being young(ish)&quot;. Their positive yet sarcastic approach began to separate them from the more serious hardcore scene. The Descendents&#x27; 1982 debut LP &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; provided the template for the United States&#x27; take on the more melodic strains of first wave punk. Many pop-punk bands, including Blink-182, cite the Descendents as a major influence. Descendents paved the way for future pop-punk bands with themes of hating parents, struggling to find a romantic partner, and social alienation. Horror punk band The Misfits also influenced pop-punk with their 1982 album &quot;Walk Among Us&quot;, which was a forerunner to later pop-punk music with the album&#x27;s vocal harmonies and pop-inspired melodies. The Misfits&#x27; gothic image inspired later pop-punk bands like Alkaline Trio and My Chemical Romance. Marginal Man was a Washington D.C. hardcore punk band who mixed hardcore punk with melodic chord progressions and clean, melodic singing, being influenced by power pop, jangle pop and new wave music.

===Underground expansion (late 1980s and early 1990s)===

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, pop-punk bands such as Green Day, the Queers, The Mr. T Experience and Screeching Weasel emerged from the record label Lookout! Records with a sound indebted to Buzzcocks, the Ramones, and the Undertones. In August 1992, early 1990s California punk rock and pop-punk was noticed by the magazine &quot;Spin&quot; when the magazine published a story called &quot;California Screamin, which is about the early 1990s underground punk rock scene in California, mentioning pop-punk bands like Screeching Weasel and Green Day. Screeching Weasel&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;My Brain Hurts&quot; influenced many subsequent pop-punk bands, with bands like Blink-182, Allister and Alkaline Trio citing them as an influence. Social Distortion, known for playing genres like traditional punk and cowpunk, achieved moderate success starting in the early 1990s prior to the 1994 mainstream explosion of pop punk. The band&#x27;s self-titled album (1990) and &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot; (1992) both eventually were certified gold in the United States.

===Mainstream popularity (mid-1990s to 2000s)===
====1994–1997: Mainstream breakthrough====

In the wake of Nirvana and grunge breaking through in the early 1990s, California&#x27;s Green Day and Bad Religion were both signed to major labels in 1993, and by 1994, pop-punk was quickly growing in mainstream popularity, soon before grunge&#x27;s popularity began to decline. Many punk rock and pop-punk bands originated from the California punk scene of the late 1980s, and several of those bands, especially Green Day and the Offspring, helped revive interest in punk rock in the 1990s. Green Day arose from the 924 Gilman Street punk scene in Berkeley, California. After building an underground following, the band signed to Reprise Records and released their major-label debut album, &quot;Dookie&quot;, in 1994. &quot;Dookie&quot; sold four million copies by the year&#x27;s end and spawned several radio singles that received extensive MTV rotation, three of which peaked at number one on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Green Day&#x27;s enormous commercial success paved the way for other North American pop-punk bands in the following decade. In 1999, &quot;Dookie&quot; was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The Offspring also achieved mainstream success in 1994 with their album &quot;Smash&quot; being certified 6× platinum by the RIAA.

MTV and radio stations such as Los Angeles&#x27; KROQ-FM played a major role in the genre&#x27;s mainstream success. The Warped Tour, started in 1995, brought punk even further into the United States mainstream. With punk rock&#x27;s renewed visibility came concerns among some in the punk subculture that the music was being co-opted by the mainstream. Some punk rock fans criticized Green Day for &quot;selling out&quot; and rejected their music as too soft, pop-oriented and not legitimate punk rock. They argued that by signing to major labels and appearing on MTV, bands like Green Day were buying into a system that punk was created to challenge.

====1997–2004: Second mainstream wave====

In 1997, Blink-182 released their breakthrough album, &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;, and the band performed at the Vans Warped Tour that year. &quot;Dammit&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, received frequent airplay on modern rock stations, and the album was certified gold by 1998. By 1999, Blink achieved further mainstream success with &quot;Enema of the State&quot;. In the description of journalist Matt Crane, the record initiated &quot;a new wave of pop punk&quot;. He added, &quot;At any given time in the late &#x27;90s/early 2000s, it was not uncommon to see Blink-182 and Sum 41 on MTV. You couldn&#x27;t escape it. Pop punk was &quot;in&quot;, and it became the undisputed mainstream choice.&quot; Lamb described second-wave pop-punk bands, led by Blink-182, as having &quot;a radio friendly sheen to their music, but still maintaining much of the speed and attitude of classic punk rock&quot;. &quot;Enema of the State&quot; was certified 5× platinum by the RIAA and its song &quot;All the Small Things&quot; peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Sum 41&#x27;s debut album &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot; was certified triple platinum in their home country of Canada. Its song &quot;Fat Lip&quot; peaked at number one on the US Billboard alternative airplay chart and number eight on the UK singles chart.

Around this time the genre saw the rise of the &quot;Drive-Thru Records Era&quot;, where a number of bands that were signed to independent record labels gained mainstream attention, namely those on Drive-Thru Records. This included bands such as New Found Glory, Allister, Fenix TX, the Early November, Something Corporate, the Starting Line, Midtown, Hellogoodbye, Rx Bandits and the Movielife. A 2017 article by Upset Magazine called New Found Glory &quot;pop punk&#x27;s most consistent and influential bands for 20 years&quot; and the Starting Line&#x27;s song &quot;Best of Me&quot; was cited by Alternative Press as one of the most influential songs in the genre.
Avril Lavigne&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Let Go&quot; set a precedent for the success of female-fronted pop-punk acts. Journalist Nick Laugher wrote that it was &quot;undeniable&quot; that the record launched pop-punk into the mainstream, &quot;blurring the lines with it and straight-up pop music, and making it more of a cultural movement than a genre.&quot; Other critics and publications noticed that because of Lavigne&#x27;s punk-driven-pop anthems, she has earned the reputation as the genre&#x27;s &quot;queen&quot;. For her part, Lavigne preferred to describe her music as &quot;heavy pop rock&quot;, rather than punk. Other pop-punk bands that achieved popularity include Good Charlotte, Simple Plan and MxPx. Good Charlotte&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; went triple platinum. Simple Plan&#x27;s 2002 debut album &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; was certified double platinum and its 2004 follow-up &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot; went platinum.

In the United Kingdom, Busted and McFly gained notability through merging pop-punk musicality with boy band aesthetics. Busted&#x27;s 2002 self-titled debut album was certified 4× platinum and their second album &quot;A Present for Everyone&quot; was certified 3× platinum. McFly&#x27;s 2004 debut album &quot;Room on the 3rd Floor&quot; peaked at number one on the UK albums chart and was certified 2× platinum.

====2004–2010: Emo pop and neon pop-punk era====
As emo pop&#x27;s merger of pop-punk emo coalesced, the record label Fueled by Ramen became a center of the movement, releasing platinum selling albums from bands like Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco and Paramore. Fall Out Boy&#x27;s 2005 song &quot;Sugar, We&#x27;re Goin Down&quot; received heavy airplay, climbing to number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 music charts. Plain White T&#x27;s was another Illinois emo pop band that received major mainstream success. Their album &quot;Every Second Counts&quot; (2006) went number 10 on the Billboard 200 charts and featured their number one single &quot;Hey There Delilah&quot;. New Jersey band My Chemical Romance was one of the faces of emo pop during the 2000s. MCR&#x27;s albums &quot;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Black Parade&quot; (2006) each sold more than 3 million copies in the US alone. The latter of the albums debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 charts. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Welcome to the Black Parade&quot; topped the US Alternative Songs chart and reached number 9 on the Billboard hot 100. Taking Back Sunday&#x27;s third album &quot;Louder Now&quot; (2006) debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 charts.

According to &quot;Brooklyn Vegan&quot;″s Andrew Sacher, after the success of &quot;hugely popular&quot; 2000s bands such as Fall Out Boy, Paramore, and My Chemical Romance, &quot;the line between pop punk and emo look[ed] close to nonexistent.&quot; Several pop-punk bands took different musical directions in the late 2000s, with Panic! at the Disco crafting the Beatles-inspired, baroque-styled record &quot;Pretty. Odd.&quot; (2008) and Fall Out Boy experimenting with glam rock, blues rock and R&amp;B on &quot;Folie a Deux&quot; (2008), both of which created fan confusion and backlash. &quot;Folie a Deux&quot; sold worse than their preceding albums, a representation of the backlash from their fanbase as the group experimented with a musical style differing from their established pop-punk sound.

The late-2000s also saw the pioneering of neon pop-punk, a style of pop-punk that embraced more elements of pop and electronic music than was traditional in the genre. Popular groups in the style at the time included All Time Low, the Maine, the Cab, Metro Station, Boys Like Girls, Cobra Starship and Forever the Sickest Kids. Metro Station&#x27;s 2007 single &quot;Shake It&quot; peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 6 on the UK Singles Chart. All Time Low&#x27;s 2008 single &quot;Dear Maria, Count Me In&quot; is certified double platinum in the United States, and their 2009 album &quot;Nothing Personal&quot; peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Digital Albums chart. The Maine&#x27;s 2008 debut album &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Won&#x27;t Stop&quot; peaked at number 9 on the Billboard digital albums chart. Cobra Starship&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Hot Mess&quot; reached number 4 on the Billboard 200. Boys Like Girls&#x27; 2009 second album &quot;Love Drunk&quot; peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200 chart.

===Decline in mainstream popularity (2010s)===
Pop-punk lost its mainstream popularity in the early 2010s, with rock bands and guitar-centric music becoming rare on dance-focused pop radio. Some acts, such as New Found Glory, have seen concert attendance numbers decrease steadily. Devon Maloney of MTV wrote that &quot;Pop punk and emo bands don&#x27;t headline Coachella or Bonnaroo; they rarely, if ever, are even billed on mainstream festival stages,&quot; and notes that it has similarly disappeared from the press. The only magazines that featured pop-punk bands were niche publications such as &quot;Alternative Press&quot; and the occasional teen magazine, while influential pop-punk magazine &quot;AMP&quot; ceased publication in 2013. The decline in mainstream popularity for the genre, coupled with the closure of many mid-size venues associated with it, resulted in many venues and labels returning to the DIY ethic that helped spawn the punk movement.

By 2012, pop-punk bands that had achieved minimal mainstream success had seen a return to grassroots form, considered &quot;the micro-operation style that yielded the results that caught the mainstream&#x27;s attention in the first place.&quot; Chad Gilbert of New Found Glory wrote in an op-ed for &quot;Alternative Press&quot; entitled &quot;Why Pop-Punk&#x27;s Not Dead—And Why It Still Matters Today&quot;: &quot;This isn&#x27;t a dead genre, and just because there isn&#x27;t a song on the radio to clarify that shouldn&#x27;t matter. ... Pop-punk means something to a lot of people and to me, having success as a band in our genre is about longevity, touring a lot and staying true to your fans.&quot;

By the 2010s, many pop-punk bands had folded; &quot;once essentially child stars, their members are now adult musicians hoping to move beyond the teen trappings that gave them careers.&quot; Fall Out Boy and Paramore, two groups that achieved mainstream success within the genre, had two number one albums—&quot;Save Rock and Roll&quot; and &quot;Paramore&quot;—side by side on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Fall Out Boy along with other pop-punk bands that peaked during the mid-2000s began experimenting with the more pop side of pop punk, in order to maintain their relevancy and keep the interest of their fanbase while gaining the appeal of the newer generations that may not like their traditional sound or relate as much to the punk themes of the 1970s. Their popularity provoked conversations about the state of the genre; Maloney opined that these records could not be viewed as pop-punk.

====2012–2016: Underground revival====

In the early 2010s, a new wave of pop-punk groups emerged, fronted by the Wonder Years, State Champs, Neck Deep, Real Friends and Knuckle Puck. Dave Beech of &quot;Clash&quot; noted that these groups were &quot;[d]arker and more mature&quot; than those previously, taking influence &quot;and occasional indifference&quot; from 1990s emo. Music commentator Finn McKenty also cited the influence from hardcore punk as being prominent during this period. On the Wonder Years&#x27; &quot;The Upsides&quot; (2010), vocalist Dan Campbell sung about &quot;His early twenties soul-searching and tales of strife&quot; which &quot;resonated with a [new] generation, inspiring countless imitators in the process.&quot; This pushed Campbell to &quot;the forefront of a new wave&quot;, and the album influenced a new wave of pop-punk bands. &quot;Rock Sound&quot; included The Wonder Years&#x27; &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; on their best albums of 2013 list, calling it &quot;the defining album of what may well have been the genre&#x27;s best year for a decade.&quot; &quot;Kerrang!&quot; said the album &quot;ripped up the pop punk blueprint&quot; pushing the genre to &quot;new peaks of invention, both lyrically and musically.&quot; The Story So Far&#x27;s &quot;What You Don&#x27;t See&quot; (2013) &quot;cemented their place at the top table of nu pop punk&quot;. In early 2014, Welsh band Neck Deep released their debut album &quot;Wishful Thinking&quot;, which &quot;Rock Sound&quot; later called it &quot;the greatest UK pop punk record of &quot;all time&quot;.&quot; During this period, Man Overboard&#x27;s &quot;Defend Pop Punk&quot; shirt design, which featured an AK-47, became a popular symbol of the scene, to the extent that a number of publication have posthumously described this period as the &quot;Defend Pop Punk Era&quot;.
Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer&#x27;s 2014 self titled album debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and in many other countries, and received what the Guardian journalist Harriet Gibsone described as &quot;the kind of mania only ever granted to a massive boyband&quot;. However, the band&#x27;s status as pop-punk was controversial. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; described the band as important to the marketing of the pop-punk scene, whereas in a Clash magazine interview with Terry Bezer, he described them as &quot;not pop-punk... [but] a valuable gateway for young kids to begin taking their first steps towards bands of... more substance.&quot; Around this time, a number of other pop-punk-influenced pop artists gained mainstream attention, including Charli XCX and Halsey.

Several pop-punk bands embarked on anniversary tours in the early to mid-2010s, playing some of their most popular albums in full. While some members of these bands have had mixed feelings about these performances, quite often these tours sell as well as or better than the first time around. Club promoters in the UK have created nights based around lasting appreciation of the genre. The Warped Tour still attracts hundreds of thousands of attendees each year; the 2012 tour attracted 556,000 festival-goers, its third-best attendance. Bobby Olivier of &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; wrote: &quot;The genre ... continues to reinvent itself and Warped is pop punk&#x27;s prom.&quot;

In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that pop-punk was &quot;still one of the most predominant and popular rock genres&quot;. The magazine conducted a reader&#x27;s poll for the &quot;10 Best Pop-Punk Albums of All Time&quot; that ultimately included Green Day (&quot;Dookie&quot;, &quot;American Idiot&quot;, &quot;Nimrod&quot;), Blink-182 (&quot;Enema of the State&quot;, &quot;Take Off Your Pants and Jacket&quot;, &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;), the Ramones (&quot;Ramones&quot;), the Offspring (&quot;Smash&quot;), Jimmy Eat World (&quot;Bleed American&quot;), and Generation X &quot;(Valley of the Dolls&quot;).

====2016–2019: Renewed mainstream interest====
In the late 2010s, the genre was influential in the development of emo rap. Many emo rappers gained mainstream attention during this period. In particular, Lil Peep, Lil Uzi Vert, Juice WRLD and XXXTentacion were all vocal about their love for and influence from pop-punk. Emo rapper Wicca Phase Springs Eternal was even a member of the influential 2010s pop-punk band Tigers Jaw. This brought about a revived interest in the genre in popular culture, leading to a number notable artists beginning to release po- punk songs towards the end of the decade. Emo rapper Lil Aaron and pop singer Kim Petras released the pop-punk song &quot;Anymore&quot; on September 5, 2018. On 13 February 2019, Yungblud and pop singer Halsey released the pop-punk song &quot;11 Minutes&quot; featuring Travis Barker. The song was certified gold in the United States, peaked at number one on the Billboard Bubbling under Top 100 chart and was performed at the 2019 iHeartRadio Music Awards. On June 7, 2019, Machine Gun Kelly, who had been established as a rapper for over a decade, released the pop-punk song &quot;I Think I&#x27;m Okay&quot; featuring Yungblud and Travis Barker. His first release in the genre, the song was nominated at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, and was certified platinum within a year. On July 12, 2019, Cold Hart and Yawns of the influential emo rap collective GothBoiClique, released the pop-punk album &quot;Good Morning Cruel World,&quot; and on September 18, 2019, emo rapper Lil Tracy released the pop-punk song &quot;Beautiful Nightmare&quot;.

An October 2019 article by Mic cited emo rap as bringing an interest to a new wave of pop-punk groups like Stand Atlantic, Doll Skin, Waterparks and rapper Vic Mensa&#x27;s band 93PUNX. Alternative Press also cited English bands Trash Boat, Boston Manor and As It Is as making &quot;significant contributions to the latest revival era&quot;.

===Mainstream resurgence (2020–present)===

In September 2020, Machine Gun Kelly released his fifth studio album &quot;Tickets to My Downfall&quot;, his first entirely pop-punk album. The album debuted at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; chart, becoming the first rock album to top the chart since Tool&#x27;s &quot;Fear Inoculum&quot; in September 2019. The Evening Standard credited the album as &quot;bridg[ing] the gap&quot; between the modern pop punk scene and the mainstream interest that developed from the emo rap scene. &quot;My Ex&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, a song from &quot;Tickets to My Downfall&quot;, has since peaked at number 21 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Because of this, a number of media outlets began crediting him with leading a pop-punk revival.

An article by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; credited Machine Gun Kelly as well as Yungblud as bringing the genre back to mainstream attention. In addition to this, the publication cited the app TikTok as one of the key factors, as videos tagged #poppunk had received 400 million views by January 21, 2021. On the app, viral trends took place using tracks from pop-punk bands like All Time Low, Simple Plan and Paramore. Some popular TikTok content creators even began releasing music in the genre around this time. Notably, TikToker Jxdn began releasing pop-punk music in February 2020, while Huddy (then LilHuddy) did the same thing the following year releasing his debut single &quot;21st Century Vampire&quot;. This led &quot;Polygon&quot; to term this new wave of artists &quot;TikTokcore&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; writer Al Shipley described pop-punk and its new association with hip hop as 2020&#x27;s &quot;commercial juggernaut&quot;.

&quot;Our Culture Mag&quot; cited KennyHoopla as a &quot;key player in the [return] of the genre&quot;, and &quot;Kerrang!&quot; called him the &quot;leader of pop punk&#x27;s new generation&quot;. Olivia Rodrigo&#x27;s 2021 pop-punk song &quot;Good 4 U&quot; peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart, which according to &quot;Slate&quot; magazine, made it &quot;rock&#x27;s first hot 100 number 1 in years&quot;. Publications such as &quot;the Face&quot;, &quot;the Independent&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot; cited this wave as having an increased diversity of sexuality, race and gender when compared to prior eras. A February 2021 article by Louder Sound cited artists like Meet Me at the Altar, Yours Truly, Noah Finnce and Jxdn as &quot;reinventing pop-punk for 2021&quot;.

In 2023, Cassadee Pope (from the defunct band Hey Monday) announced that she was stepping away from country music and going back to her roots in pop-punk, with the release of the singles &quot;People That I Love Leave&quot;, &quot;Almost There&quot;, and &quot;Coma&quot; (featuring Taylor Acorn). In August 2023, Rodrigo released the song &quot;Bad Idea Right?&quot;, which features pop-punk and indie rock influences, from her second studio album &quot;Guts&quot;. The song peaked at number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rock &amp; Alternative Songs Chart. On 18 October 2024, Bruno Mars and K-pop singer Rosé released the pop-punk single &quot;Apt.&quot;, which became one of the biggest streaming successes in both the United States and the world upon release, topping Spotify&#x27;s global and US daily streaming charts.

==Offshoots and subgenres==

===Emo pop===
Emo pop became popular in the mid-2000s, with record labels such as Fueled by Ramen releasing platinum albums from bands including My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus and Paramore. Maloney wrote: &quot;While many pop punk fans adamantly deny any association between their favorite acts and those labeled &quot;emo,&quot; crossover bands who melded the two have gradually put both genres in the same scene-boat.&quot;

===Easycore===

Easycore (less commonly known as popcore, dudecore, softcore, happy hardcore, and EZ) is a genre that merges pop-punk with elements of metalcore.
It often makes use of breakdowns, screamed vocals, major key progressions and riffs and synthesizers. The genre&#x27;s roots come from early 2000s pop-punk groups Sum 41 and New Found Glory. New Found Glory&#x27;s self-titled and &quot;Stick and Stones&quot; albums and Sum 41&#x27;s song &quot;Fat Lip&quot; were some of the earliest and most influential released in the genre. The style&#x27;s name originates from the 2008 &quot;Easycore tour&quot;, which featured A Day to Remember, Four Year Strong and headliners New Found Glory, which itself was a pun based on the name of &quot;hardcore punk&quot;.

===Neon pop-punk===

Neon pop-punk (also known as simply neon pop) is a form of pop-punk that emphasizes synthesizers. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; writer Tyler Sharp wrote that while this wasn&#x27;t the first instance that &quot;a band decided to put fuzzy keys over their chord progressions, but it was a time when that formula was perfected.&quot; Kika Chatterjee of &quot;Alternative Press&quot; added that the late 2000s &quot;brought in glowing synths and poppy melodies that shifted the entire definition of [pop punk]&quot;, giving it the &quot;neon&quot; moniker. Sharp cited Forever the Sickest Kids&#x27; debut album &quot;Underdog Alma Mater&quot; (2008) as &quot;a big moment&quot; for the genre.

==Criticism==
The punk rock music community often perceived pop-punk to be, according to Iain Ellis of &quot;PopMatters&quot;, &quot;too soft, too fake, too derivative, and too corporate&quot;. In a 2003 interview, Buzzcocks guitarist Steve Diggle would suggest that punk had become a &quot;huge umbrella&quot;, stating, &quot;And fair play to bands like Green Day and stuff, you know, they&#x27;ve been inspired when they were really young by us and the Clash and things, but it comes from a different well. When we started, punk to me was the Clash, the [Sex] Pistols, and the Buzzcocks over here [the United Kingdom], and in the [United] States it was the Dolls, Iggy, and the Ramones. We invented our style, just like the Clash did and the Ramones did. But the bands that have come later, some of them you see tend to just ape what went on before, where I&#x27;d rather them do their own thing a bit more with it.&quot;

Green Day were accused of selling out since the release of &quot;Dookie&quot; for signing to a major label and becoming mainstream. John Lydon of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols criticized Green Day and said that Green Day are not a punk band. Lydon said: &quot;Don&#x27;t try and tell me Green Day are punk. They&#x27;re not, they&#x27;re plonk and they&#x27;re bandwagoning on something they didn&#x27;t come up with themselves. I think they are phony.&quot; Green Day guitarist and lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong said: &quot;Sometimes I think we&#x27;ve become redundant because we&#x27;re this big band now; we&#x27;ve made a lot of money—we&#x27;re not punk rock anymore. But then I think about it and just say, &#x27;You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can&#x27;t take the punk rock out of us.

Blink-182 also received a lot of criticism from punk rock fans, being accused of selling out for their pop-music-inspired style of pop-punk. Lydon called Blink-182 &quot;bunch of silly boys ... an imitation of a comedy act.&quot; Blink-182 guitarist and singer Tom DeLonge responded to criticism, saying: &quot;I love all those criticisms, because fuck all those magazines! I hate with a passion &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; and all those zines that think they know what punk is supposed to be. I think it&#x27;s so much more punk to piss people off than to conform to all those veganistic views.&quot;

In a November 2004 interview, Sum 41 rhythm guitarist and lead singer Deryck Whibley said: &quot;We don&#x27;t even consider ourselves punk. We&#x27;re just a rock band. We want to do something different. We want to do our own thing. That&#x27;s how music has always been to us.&quot; Sum 41&#x27;s lead guitarist Dave Baksh reiterated Whibley&#x27;s claims, stating &quot;We just call ourselves rock... It&#x27;s easier to say than punk, especially around all these fuckin&#x27; kids that think they know what punk is. Something that was based on not having any rules has probably been one of the strictest fucking rule books in the world.&quot;

Music critic for Treblezine Jeff Terich argued that the debate regarded the ethics of &quot;pop-punk&quot; is redundant, saying that there is &quot;no discussion of the genre that doesn&#x27;t eventually devolve into the black-mold-like growth of Disney-approved mallrats, but the irony of it is that all punk is pop. The Ramones? Pop. The Clash? Pop. And The Buzzcocks? Damn right they&#x27;re pop.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;New Orleans&quot; (CL/CA-32) was the lead in service with the United States Navy. The &quot;New Orleans&quot;-class cruisers were the last U.S. cruisers built to the specifications and standards of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Such ships, with a limit of standard displacement and calibre main guns may be referred to as &quot;treaty cruisers.&quot; Originally classified a light cruiser, because of her thin armor, she was reclassified, soon after being laid down, a heavy cruiser, because of her 8-inch guns. The term &quot;heavy cruiser&quot; was not defined until the London Naval Treaty in 1930.

==Inter-war period==
&quot;New Orleans&quot; keel was laid on 14 March 1931, at the New York Navy Yard, commonly known as the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The ship was launched on 12 April 1933, sponsored by Cora S. Jahncke, a native of New Orleans, Louisiana, and daughter of Ernest L. Jahncke, a civil engineer and president of the Jahncke Shipbuilding Co. in New Orleans. Jahncke had served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in the administration of President Herbert Hoover, returning to private life in March 1933 with the inauguration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. &quot;New Orleans&quot; was commissioned at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 15 February 1934, with Captain Allen B. Reed as the first commander. Attending the commissioning ceremonies were Rear Admiral Yates Stirling Jr., Commandant of the New York Naval Yard and former Assistant Navy Secretary Jahncke. Among &quot;New Orleans&quot;″ junior officer plankowners in 1934, were Jahncke&#x27;s son, Ensign E.L. Jahncke Jr. and Ensign T.H. Moorer, who as Admiral Thomas H. Moorer was Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) from 1967 to 1970 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1970 to 1974.

Under Captain Reed&#x27;s command that ended on 30 August 1935, &quot;New Orleans&quot; made a shakedown Transatlantic crossing to Great Britain and Scandinavia in May and June 1934. &quot;New Orleans&quot; made ports of call and was greeted by thousands at Stockholm, Sweden, Copenhagen, Denmark, Amsterdam, Netherlands and Portsmouth, England, returning to New York on 28 June. On 5 July, &quot;New Orleans&quot; sailed to Balboa, Panama, the western entrance to the Panama Canal to rendez-vous with the heavy cruiser , carrying President Roosevelt, on a nearly . cruise to Hawaii and an exercise with the United States Airship and her aircraft off the California coast.

&quot;New Orleans&quot; reached Honolulu, Hawaii, on 26 July 1934, and Astoria, Oregon, on 2 August, where the cruise ended. &quot;New Orleans&quot; sailed at once for Panama and Cuba, stopping at San Pedro, Los Angeles, on 7 August 1934. She exercised off New England into 1935, then visited her namesake city at the end of March while en route to join United States Fleet Scouting Force Cruiser Division 6 (CruDiv 6) based out of San Pedro, and operating along the coast of California and the eastern Pacific. &quot;New Orleans&quot; was open for public viewing while visiting the &quot;Crescent City&quot; and thousands of citizens visited the ship during the time she was berthed there. Shortly after arriving at San Pedro, the cruiser participated in Fleet problem XVI from 29 April to 10 June. It was the largest mock battle ever staged and conducted in five separate stages over five million square miles of the North Central Pacific between Midway, Hawaii, and the Aleutian Islands, involving 321 vessels and 70,000 men. In June &quot;New Orleans&quot; visited San Diego for the first-ever Fleet Week, one of 114 American warships in the &quot;mightiest fleet ever assembled under the U.S. flag&quot; for the California Pacific International Exposition.

&quot;New Orleans&quot; returned to the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York where she was dry-docked for maintenance from 20 August to 7 December 1936. Early in 1937, she was once more in the Pacific. Aside from winter training in the Caribbean early in 1939, she served out of California ports until joining the Hawaiian Detachment on 12 October 1939, for exercises, training, and, as war drew close, vigilant patrol.

==World War II==

===Attack on Pearl Harbor===
Moored in Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, &quot;New Orleans&quot; was taking power and light from the dock, her engines under repair. With yard power out during the attack, &quot;New Orleans&quot;″ engineers began to raise steam, working by flashlight, while on deck men fired on the Japanese attackers with rifles and pistols. The crew was forced to break the locks on the ammunition ready boxes as the keys couldn&#x27;t be located, and because the ship was taking power from the dock, the 5&quot;/25 cal AA gun had to be aimed and fired manually. The gunners topside were ducking machine gun bullets and shrapnel, training their guns manually, as they had no ammunition other than the few shells in their ready boxes. The ammunition hoists did not have power, making it nearly impossible to get more ammunition topside to the gun crews. The shells had to be pulled up the powerless hoists by ropes attached to their metal cases. Every man with no specific job at the moment formed ammunition lines to get the shells to the guns. A number of her crew were injured when a fragmentation bomb exploded close aboard. &quot;New Orleans&quot; suffered no severe damage during the attack.

===1942===
Before having the engine work complete at Pearl Harbor, the cruiser convoyed troops to Palmyra Atoll and Johnston Atoll operating on only three of her four engines; she then returned to San Francisco on 13 January 1942 for engineering repairs and installation of new search radar and 20 mm guns. She sailed on 12 February, commanding the escort for a troop convoy to Brisbane; from Australia she screened a convoy to Nouméa, and returned to Pearl Harbor to join Task Force 11 (TF 11).

====Battle of Coral Sea====
TF 11 sortied on 15 April to join the task force southwest of the New Hebrides. It was this joint force, together with a cruiser-destroyer group, which won the Battle of the Coral Sea on 7–8 May, driving back a southward thrust of the Japanese which threatened Australia and New Zealand and their seaborne life lines. In this battle was sunk and &quot;New Orleans&quot; stood by, her men diving overboard to rescue survivors and her boat crews closing the burning carrier, saving 580 of &quot;Lexington&quot;″s crew who were subsequently landed at Nouméa. &quot;New Orleans&quot; then patrolled the eastern Solomons until sailing to replenish at Pearl Harbor.

====Battle of Midway====
&quot;New Orleans&quot; sailed on 28 May, screening , to surprise the Japanese in the Battle of Midway. On 2 June, she rendezvoused with the &quot;Yorktown&quot; force, and two days later joined battle. Three of the four Japanese carriers—&quot;Akagi,&quot; &quot;Kaga,&quot; and &quot;Soryu&quot;—were sunk by hits scored in dive bomber attacks. The fourth carrier, &quot;Hiryu,&quot; was found and wrecked later, but not before her dive bombers had damaged &quot;Yorktown&quot; so badly she had to be abandoned.

====Battle of the Eastern Solomons====
Again the &quot;New Orleans&quot; was replenished at Pearl Harbor, steaming out on 7 July to rendezvous off the Fiji Islands for the invasion of the Solomon Islands, during which she screened the . Fighting off enemy air attacks on 24–25 August, the &quot;New Orleans&quot; aided the U.S. Marine Corps beachhead on Guadalcanal, as a Japanese landing expedition was turned back in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. At this point, &quot;New Orleans&quot; had been in the Coral Sea for two full months, and food began to run low. The crew went on half rations and Spam became the main course of every meal; eventually they ran out of rice. When the &quot;Saratoga&quot; was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine on 31 August, the &quot;New Orleans&quot; escorted her to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 21 September.

====Battle of Tassafaronga====
With the repaired carrier, &quot;New Orleans&quot; sailed to Fiji early in November 1942, then proceeded to Espiritu Santo, arriving on 27 November to return to action in the Solomons. With four other cruisers and six destroyers, she fought in the Battle of Tassafaronga on the night of 30 November, engaging a Japanese destroyer-transport force. When the flagship &quot;Minneapolis&quot; was struck by two torpedoes, &quot;New Orleans&quot;, next astern, was forced to sheer away to avoid collision, and ran into the track of a torpedo, which detonated the ship&#x27;s forward magazines and gasoline tanks. This explosion severed of her bow just forward of turret No. 2. The severed bow, including Turret No. 1, swung around the port side and punched several holes in the length of &quot;New Orleans&quot;″ hull before sinking at the stern and damaging the port inboard propeller. With one quarter of her length gone, slowed to , and on fire. Everyone in turrets one and two perished, total of 183 men killed. Herbert Brown, a seaman in the ship&#x27;s plotting room, described the scene after the torpedo hit:

&quot;I had to see. I walked alongside the silent turret two and was stopped by a lifeline stretched from the outboard port lifeline to the side of the turret. Thank God it was there, for one more step and I would have pitched head first into the dark water thirty feet below. The bow was gone. One hundred and twenty five feet of ship and number one main battery turret with three 8 inch guns were gone. Eighteen hundred tons of ship were gone. Oh my God, all those guys I went through boot camp with – all gone&quot; 

Damage control parties managed to repair the ship enough to sail to Tulagi Harbor near daybreak on 1 December.

The crew camouflaged their ship from air attack, jury-rigged a bow of coconut logs, and worked clearing away wreckage. Eleven days later, &quot;New Orleans&quot; sailed stern first, to avoid sinking, to Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney, Australia, arriving on 24 December. At Cockatoo, the damaged propeller was replaced and other repairs were made including the installation of a temporary stub bow. On 7 March 1943, she left Sydney for Puget Sound Navy Yard, sailing backward the entire voyage, where a new bow was fitted with the use of &quot;Minneapolis&quot;″ No. 2 Turret. All battle damage was repaired and she was given a major refit involving the reducing of the forward superstructure along the lines of other pre-war cruisers, adding new air-search and surface search radars, as well as numerous 20mm and 40mm &quot;Bofors&quot; anti-aircraft guns. In addition, her boilers, machinery, and hull structures were overhauled to almost new condition. She continued to sail with the back portion (aft) riveted and the front portion (bow) welded.
===1943===
Returning to Pearl Harbor on 31 August for combat training, &quot;New Orleans&quot; next joined a cruiser-destroyer force to bombard Wake Island on 5–6 October, repulsing a Japanese torpedo-plane attack. Her next sortie from Pearl Harbor came on 10 November when she sailed to fire precision bombardment in the Gilberts on 20 November, then to screen carriers striking the eastern Marshalls on 4 December. In aerial attacks that day, the new , namesake of the carrier whose men &quot;New Orleans&quot; had pulled from the Coral Sea, was torpedoed, and &quot;New Orleans&quot; guarded her successful retirement to repairs at Pearl Harbor, arriving on 9 December.

===1944===
From 29 January 1944, &quot;New Orleans&quot; fired on targets in the Marshalls, hitting air installations and shipping as the Navy took Kwajalein. She fueled at Majuro, then sailed 11 February to join the fast carriers in a raid on Truk, Japanese bastion in the Carolines on 17–18 February. While air strikes were flown, &quot;New Orleans&quot;, with other warships circled the atoll to catch escaping ships; the task force&#x27;s combined gunfire sank a light cruiser, a destroyer, a trawler, and a submarine chaser. The force sailed on to hit the Marianas, then returned to Majuro and Pearl Harbor.

The carriers, with &quot;New Orleans&quot; in escort, attacked targets in the Carolines late in March, then in April, sailed south to support Allied landings at Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura), New Guinea. There on 22 April, a disabled plane flew into &quot;New Orleans&quot;″ mainmast, hitting gun mounts as it fell into the sea. The ship was sprayed with gas as the plane exploded on hitting the water, one crew member was lost, another badly injured, but &quot;New Orleans&quot; continued in action, patrolling and plane guarding off New Guinea, then joining in further raids on Truk and Satawan, which she bombarded on 30 April. She returned to Majuro on 4 May.

Preparations were made in the Marshalls for the invasion of the Marianas, for which &quot;New Orleans&quot; sortied from Kwajalein on 10 June. She bombarded Saipan on 15–16 June, then joined the screen protecting carriers as they prepared to meet the Japanese Mobile Fleet in the Battle of the Philippine Sea.

&quot;New Orleans&quot; made patrols and bombardments on Saipan and Tinian into August, returned to Eniwetok on the 13th, and sailed the 28th for carrier raids on the Bonins, bombardments of Iwo Jima on 1–2 September, and direct air support for the invasion of the Palaus. After re-provisioning at Manus, the task force assaulted Okinawa, Formosa, and Northern Luzon, destroying Japanese land-based aviation which otherwise would have threatened the landings on Leyte on 20 October.

&quot;New Orleans&quot; was present during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which started on 23 October. On 25 October, the Fast Carrier Strike Force had steamed north, to attack the Northern Force commanded by Jisaburō Ozawa. &quot;New Orleans&quot; again screened for the carriers, which sank or damaged several Japanese carriers. Task Force 34 was detached to finish off several of the crippled Japanese ships with gunfire; &quot;New Orleans&quot; and three other cruisers sank the light carrier and the destroyer .

===1945===
After replenishing at Ulithi, &quot;New Orleans&quot; guarded carriers during raids throughout the Philippines in preparation for the invasion of Mindoro, then late in December sailed for a Mare Island Navy Yard overhaul, followed by training in Hawaii. She returned to Ulithi on 18 April 1945, and two days later, departed to join Task Force 54 (TF 54), in the ongoing invasion of Okinawa, arriving at Okinawa on 23 April. Here, she engaged with shore batteries and fired directly against the enemy lines. After nearly two months on station, she sailed to replenish and repair in the Philippines, and was at Subic Bay when hostilities ceased in the Pacific War.

==Post-war==
&quot;New Orleans&quot; sailed on 28 August with a cruiser-destroyer force to ports of China and Korea. She covered the internment of Japanese ships at Tsingtao, the evacuation of liberated Allied prisoners-of-war, and the landing of troops in Korea and China. She sailed on 17 November from the mouth of the Peking River (Hai He), carrying veterans homeward bound. More returning troops came aboard at the Sasebo U.S. Fleet Activities base, and all were disembarked at San Francisco 8 December. After similar duty took her to Guam in January 1946, she sailed through the Panama Canal for a 10-day visit to her namesake city. She then steamed to Philadelphia Navy Yard, arriving on 12 March. There, she was decommissioned on 10 February 1947 and lay in reserve until struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959 and sold for scrapping on 22 September to Boston Metals Company, Baltimore, Maryland.

<text>John Taylor (1694–1761) was an English dissenting preacher, Hebrew scholar, and theologian.

==Early life==
The son of a timber merchant at Lancaster, he was born at Scotforth, Lancashire. His father, John was an Anglican, his mother, Susannah a dissenter. Taylor began his education for the dissenting ministry in 1709 under Thomas Dixon at Whitehaven, where he drew up for himself a Hebrew grammar (1712). From Whitehaven he went to study under the tutor Thomas Hill, son of the ejected minister Thomas Hill, near Derby. Leaving Hill on 25 March 1715, he took charge on 7 April of an extra-parochial chapel at Kirkstead, Lincolnshire, then used for nonconformist worship by the Disney family. He was ordained (11 April 1716) by dissenting ministers in Derbyshire. In 1726 he declined a call to Pudsey, Yorkshire.

==In Norwich==
In 1733 he moved to Norwich, as colleague to Peter Finch, son of Henry Finch.

So far Taylor had not deviated from dissenting orthodoxy, though hesitating about subscription. According to a family tradition, given by William Turner, on settling at Norwich he went through Samuel Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity&quot; (1712) with his congregation, adopted its view, and came forward (1737) in defence of a dissenting layman excommunicated for heterodoxy on this topic by James Sloss (1698–1772) of Nottingham, a pupil of John Simson. On 25 February 1754 Taylor laid the first stone of the Octagon Chapel, Norwich, opened 12 May 1756, and described by John Wesley (23 December 1757) as &#x27;perhaps the most elegant one in all Europe,&#x27; and too fine for &#x27;the old coarse gospel.&#x27; In his opening sermon, Taylor, who had received (6 April) the diploma (dated 20 January) of D.D. from the University of Glasgow, disowned all names such as Presbyterian and the like, claiming that of Christian only; a claim attacked by a local critic, probably Grantham Killingworth, writing as a Quaker, under the name of &#x27;M. Adamson.’

==Warrington Academy tutor==
Around the end of 1757 Taylor returned to Lancashire as divinity tutor (including moral philosophy) in Warrington Academy, opened 20 October 1757. The appointment was a tribute to his reputation, but at the age of sixty-three the change turned out unhappily for him. He had troubles in class teaching, on doctrinal matters with John Seddon, and was convinced that he was denied due deference. Rheumatism settled in his knees, and he could not walk without crutches. Rousing his powers, he wrote, but did not live to publish, a fervent tract on prayer.

==Death==
Taylor died in his sleep on 5 March 1761, and was buried in the chapel-yard at Chowbent, Lancashire. His funeral sermon was preached by Edward Harwood. A tablet to his memory is in Chowbent Chapel; another in the Octagon Chapel, Norwich, bearing a Latin inscription by Samuel Parr.

==Works and views==
===Scholar===
His classical knowledge, according to Edward Harwood, was &#x27;almost unrivalled,&#x27; but Samuel Parr found fault with his latinity. His &quot;Hebrew Concordance&quot; of 1754–7 was both a concordance (based on earlier works) and a lexicon of Hebrew, and was his unaided work. In 1751 he issued proposals for its publication, after more than thirteen years&#x27; work. The subscription list to the first volume (1754) contains the names of twenty-two English and fifteen Irish bishops, and the work is dedicated to the hierarchy. Based on Johann Buxtorf the Elder and Noldius (Christian Nolde), the concordance is arranged to serve the purposes of a Hebrew-English and English-Hebrew lexicon, and also attempt to fix the primitive meaning of Hebrew roots.

===Theologian===
In 1757 Wesley described Taylor&#x27;s views as ‘old deism in a new dress.’ Job Orton remarked (1778) that &#x27;he had to the last a great deal of the puritan in him.&#x27; Orton&#x27;s earlier guess (1771), adopted by Walter Wilson, that Taylor had become a Socinian, is dismissed as groundless by Alexander Gordon in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;.

Gordon in his &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; article also wrote that the ethical core interested Taylor more than speculative theology. His work on original sin (&quot;Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin&quot;, 1740, written 1735) was against the Calvinistic view of human nature, and was influential: witnessed in Scotland by Robert Burns (&quot;Epistle to John Goudie&quot;), and in New England, according to Jonathan Edwards. It was answered first by David Jennings in &quot;A Vindication of the Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin&quot; (anonymous, 1740). Isaac Watts replied to Taylor in &quot;The Ruin and Recovery of Man&quot; (1740). James Hervey&#x27;s &quot;Theron and Aspasio&quot; is partly aimed at Taylor, if not explicitly. John Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Doctrine of Original Sin&quot; (1757) is a detailed answer to Taylor, drawing on Jennings, Hervey and Watts. &quot;Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin&quot; laid a basis for the later Unitarian movement and the American Congregationalists.

His study of Pauline theology, partly on the lines of John Locke, produced (1745) a &#x27;Key&#x27; to the apostolic writings with an application of this &#x27;Key&#x27; to the interpretation of the &quot;Epistle to the Romans&quot;. Here, rather than in his treatise on the topic (1751), his view of atonement is clearly defined.

==Works==
Taylor published, besides single sermons and tracts:

*&quot;A Narrative of Mr. Joseph Rawson&#x27;s Case ... with a Prefatory Discourse in Defence of the Common Rights of Christians&quot;, 1737, anon.; the &quot;Narrative&quot; is by Rawson; Sloss replied in &quot;A True Narrative&quot;, 1737); 2nd edit. with author&#x27;s name, 1742.

He left in manuscript a paraphrase on &quot;Ephesians&quot;, and four volumes of an unfinished abridgment (1721–22) of Matthew Henry&#x27;s &quot;Exposition&quot; of the Old Testament, of which specimens are given in the &quot;Universal Theological Magazine&quot;, December 1804, pp. 314 sq. A selection from his works was published with title, &quot;The Principles and Pursuits of an English Presbyterian&quot;, 1843.

<doc id="199645" wikidata="Q944870" url="?curid=199645" title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">
<text>The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) developed by the European Space Agency and Eurocontrol on behalf of the European Commission. Currently, it supplements GPS by reporting on the reliability and accuracy of their positioning data and sending out corrections. The system will supplement Galileo in the future version 3.0.

EGNOS consists of 40 Ranging Integrity Monitoring Stations, 2 Mission Control Centres, 6 Navigation Land Earth Stations, the EGNOS Wide Area Network (EWAN), and 3 geostationary satellites. Ground stations determine the accuracy of the satellite navigation systems data and transfer it to the geostationary satellites; users may freely obtain this data from those satellites using an EGNOS-enabled receiver, or over the Internet. One main use of the system is in aviation.

According to specifications, horizontal position accuracy when using EGNOS-provided corrections should be better than seven metres. In practice, the horizontal position accuracy is at the metre level.

Similar service is provided in North America by the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), in Russia by the System for Differential Corrections and Monitoring (SDCM), and in Asia, by Japan&#x27;s Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS) and India&#x27;s GPS-aided GEO augmented navigation (GAGAN).

Galileo and EGNOS received a budget of €14.6 billion for its six-year, 2021–2027, research and development period.

==History and roadmap==
The system started its initial operations in July 2005, with accuracy better than two metres and availability above 99%. As of July 2005, EGNOS has been broadcasting a continuous signal, and at the end of July 2005, the system was again used to track cyclists in the Tour de France road race.

In 2009, the European Commission announced it had signed a contract with the company European Satellite Services Provider to run EGNOS. The official start of operations was announced by the European Commission on 1 October 2009. The system was certified for use in safety of life applications in March 2011. An EGNOS Data Access Service became available in July 2012.

Initial work to extend EGNOS coverage to the Southern Africa region is being done under a project called ESESA - EGNOS Service Extension to South Africa.

The European Commission is defining the roadmap for the evolution of the EGNOS mission. This roadmap should cope with legacy and new missions:
* 2011–2030: En-route / NPA / APV1 / LPV200 service based on augmentation of GPS L1 only. The Safety of Life (SoL) will be guaranteed up to 2030 in compliance with ICAO SBAS SARPS.
* 2020+: It is planned that EGNOS will experiment with a major evolution, EGNOS V3, including the fulfilment of the SBAS L1/L5 standard, expansion to dual-frequency, and evolution toward a multi-constellation concept.

In 2021, following Brexit, the United Kingdom withdrew regulatory approval for EGNOS, and aircraft pilots were no longer permitted to use the system.

== Satellites and SISNeT ==


Similar to WAAS, EGNOS is mostly designed for aviation users who enjoy unperturbed reception of direct signals from geostationary satellites up to very high latitudes. The use of EGNOS on the ground, especially in urban areas, is limited due to relatively low elevation of geostationary satellites: about 30° above horizon in central Europe and much less in the North of Europe. To address this problem, ESA released in 2002 SISNeT, an Internet service designed for continuous delivery of EGNOS signals to ground users. The first experimental SISNeT receiver was created by the Finnish Geodetic Institute. The commercial SISNeT receivers have been developed by Septentrio. PRN #136 was placed into the Operational Platform from 23/08/2018 at 10:00 UTC and PRN #120 was placed into Test Platform from 30/08/2018 at 13:00 UTC.

== Services ==

* Open Service (OS): It improves positioning accuracy by correcting error sources affecting GNSS signals intended for a wide range of applications in various domains. The corrections transmitted by EGNOS help mitigate the ranging error sources related to satellite clocks, satellite position and ionospheric effects. EGNOS can also detect distortions affecting the signals transmitted by GNSS and prevent users from tracking unhealthy or misleading signals that could lead to inaccurate positioning. The service is available free-of-charge in Europe to any user equipped with an appropriate GPS/SBAS compatible receiver for which no specific receiver certification is required. It has been available since 1 October 2009.
* Safety of Life (SoL) Service: The main objective of the EGNOS SoL service is to support civil aviation operations down to Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV) minima. However, the EGNOS SoL service might also be used in a wide range of other application domains (e.g. maritime, rail, road...) in the future. This service provides the most stringent level of signal-in-space performance to all Safety of Life user communities. The EGNOS system has been designed so that the EGNOS Signal-In-Space (SIS) is compliant with the ICAO SARPs for SBAS. It has been available since 2 March 2011.
* EGNOS Data Access Service (EDAS): EDAS is the terrestrial data service and offers ground-based access to EGNOS data in real time and also in a historical FTP archive to authorised users (e.g. added-value application providers). EDAS is the single point of access for the data collected and generated by the EGNOS ground infrastructure distributed over Europe and North Africa, it is aimed at users who require enhanced performance for commercial and professional use. It has been available since 26 July 2012.

==Architecture==
EGNOS is divided into four functional segments:

1. Ground segment: comprises a network of 40 Ranging Integrity Monitoring Stations (RIMS), 2 Mission Control Centres (MCC), 2 Navigation Land Earth Stations (NLES) per Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO), and the EGNOS Wide Area Network (EWAN), which provides the communication network for all the components of the ground segment.

* 40 RIMS: the main function of the RIMS is to collect measurements from GPS satellites and to transmit these raw data every second to the Central Processing Facilities (CPF) of each MCC. 
* 2 MCC: these receive the information from the RIMS and generate correction messages to improve satellite signal accuracy and information messages on the status of the satellites (integrity). It acts as the &quot;brain&quot; of the system.
* 6 NLES: the NLESs (two for each GEO for redundancy purposes) transmit the EGNOS message received from the central processing facility to the GEO satellites for broadcasting to users and to ensure the synchronisation with the GPS signal.

2. Support segment: In addition to the above-mentioned stations/centres, the system has other ground support installations involved in system operations planning and performance assessment, namely the Performance Assessment and Checkout Facility (PACF) and the Application Specific Qualification Facility (ASQF) which are operated by the EGNOS Service Provider (ESSP).

* PACF (Performance Assessment and Check-out Facility): provides support to EGNOS management in the form of performance analysis, troubleshooting, and operational procedures as well upgrading specifications and validations and providing maintenance support.
* ASQF (Application Specific Qualification Facility): provides civil aviation and aeronautical certification authorities with the tools to qualify, validate and certify the different EGNOS applications.

3. Space Segment: composed of at least three geostationary satellites broadcasting corrections and integrity information for GPS satellites in the L1 frequency band (1575.42 MHz). This space segment configuration provides a high level of redundancy over the whole service area in the event of a failure in the geostationary satellite link. EGNOS operations are handled in such a way that, at any point in time, at least two GEOs broadcast an operational signal.

4. User Segment: the EGNOS user segment consists of EGNOS receivers that enable their users to accurately compute their positions with integrity. To receive EGNOS signals, the end user must use an EGNOS-compatible receiver. Currently, EGNOS compatible receivers are available for such market segments as agriculture, aviation, maritime, rail, mapping/surveying, road and location based services (LBS).

==Aviation==

In March 2011, the EGNOS Safety-of-Life Service was deemed acceptable for use in aviation. This allows pilots throughout Europe to use the EGNOS system as a form of positioning during an approach, and allows pilots to land the aircraft in IMC using a GPS approach.

As of September 2018 LPV (Localizer performance with vertical guidance) landing procedures, which are EGNOS-enabled, were available at more than 180 airports across Europe.

<text>John Edward Taylor (11 September 1791 – 6 January 1844) was an English business tycoon, editor, publisher and member of The Portico Library, who was the founder of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; newspaper in 1821. It was renamed in 1959 &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

==Personal life==
Taylor was born at Ilminster, Somerset, England, to Mary Scott, the poet, and John Taylor, a Unitarian minister who moved after his wife&#x27;s death to Manchester with his son to run a school there. John Edward was educated at his father&#x27;s school and at Daventry Academy. He was apprenticed to a cotton manufacturer in Manchester and later became a successful merchant; Taylor &quot;derived much of his wealth from Manchester’s cotton industry, an industry that relied on firms such as Taylor’s trading with cotton plantations in the Americas that had enslaved millions of Black people&quot;.

His children by his first wife and first cousin Sophia Russell Taylor (née Scott) included a son named after himself and a daughter, Harriet Ann Taylor, who in 1867 married the economist and logician Stanley Jevons.

==Membership of the Little Circle==

A moderate supporter of reform, from 1815 Taylor was a member of a group of Nonconformist Liberals, meeting in the Manchester home of John Potter, termed the &quot;Little Circle&quot;. Other members of the group included: Joseph Brotherton (preacher); Archibald Prentice (later editor of the &quot;Manchester Times&quot;); John Shuttleworth (industrialist and municipal reformer); Absalom Watkin (parliamentary reformer and anti corn law campaigner); William Cowdray Jnr (editor of the &quot;Manchester Gazette&quot;); Thomas Potter (later first mayor of Manchester) and Richard Potter (later MP for Wigan).

After the death of John Potter, the Potter brothers formed a second Little Circle group, to begin a campaign for parliamentary reform. This called for the better proportional representation in the Houses of Parliament from the rotten boroughs towards the fast-growing industrialised towns of Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and Salford. After the petition raised on behalf of the group by Absalom Watkin, Parliament passed the Reform Act 1832.

==&quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;==

Taylor witnessed the Peterloo massacre in 1819, but was unimpressed by its leaders, writing:
However, the radical press in Manchester, particularly &quot;Manchester Observer&quot; supported the protests, and it was not until the &quot;Observer&quot; was closed by successive police prosecutions that the road was clear for a newspaper closer to Taylor&#x27;s liberal-minded mill-owning friends.

In 1821, the members of the &quot;Little Circle&quot; excluding Cowdroy backed John Edward Taylor in founding the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, published by law only once a week, which Taylor continued to edit until his death.

==Death==
John Edward Taylor is buried in the Rusholme Road Cemetery (also known as the Dissenters Burial Ground and now Gartside Gardens, in Chorlton-on-Medlock), alongside his first wife Sophia Russell Scott.

==Legacy==
His younger son, also John Edward Taylor (though usually known as Edward) (1830–1905) became a co-owner of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; in 1852 and sole owner four years later. He was also editor of the paper from 1861 to 1872. He bought the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; from its founder Mitchell Henry in 1868 and was owner, then co-owner, until his death. He had no children; after his death the &quot;Evening News&quot; passed into the hands of his nephews in the Allen family, while the &quot;Guardian&quot; was sold to its editor, his cousin C. P. Scott.

At least two grandsons, Charles Peter Allen and Arthur Acland Allen, became MPs.

<doc id="199653" wikidata="Q1645825" url="?curid=199653" title="Noble (English coin)">
<text>The noble was the first English gold coin produced in quantity, introduced during the second coinage (1344–1346) of King Edward III. It was preceded by the gold penny and the florin, minted during the reign of King Henry III and the beginning of the reign of King Edward III; these saw little circulation. The derivatives of the noble, the half noble and quarter noble, on the other hand, were produced in quantity and were very popular.

The value of the coin was six shillings and eight pence (written 6/8, or 6s.8d., vjs.viijd.), which was equivalent to eighty old pence or one-third of a pound sterling. The weight was changed from issue to issue to maintain this value until 1464 when the value was increased. Throughout the history of this denomination there are many variations of inscription, mintmark, and (to some extent) of design.

==Origin==
The coin was introduced during the second coinage (1344–1346) of King Edward III, when the coin weighed 138.5 grains (9.0 grams); during the king&#x27;s third coinage (1346–1351) the weight of the coin was reduced to 128.5 grains (8.3 grams), while in his fourth coinage (1351–1377) it became even lighter, at 120 grains (7.8 grams). The diameter of the noble was 33–35 mm, half noble 25–26 mm and quarter noble 19–21 mm.

Edward III Second Coinage obverse legend: (&quot;Edward by the grace of God King of England and France Lord of Ireland&quot;). Design: The king, holding a sword and shield in a ship. Reverse legend: (&quot;But Jesus passing through their midst went His way&quot;). Design: &#x27;L&#x27; in centre of a cross. The image of the ship and the Biblical text (from the Gospel of Luke 4:30) commemorate Edward&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Sluys in 1340.

The Third Coinage design is the same as the Second Coinage, except for having an &#x27;E&#x27; in the centre of the cross on the reverse.

During the Fourth Coinage, politics required changes in the inscriptions. Initially Edward retained his claim on the throne of France, but following the Treaty of Brétigny in 1360 this claim was dropped, and coins instead claim Aquitaine. In 1369 the treaty broke down and the claim on the throne of France was reinstated.

&quot;Pre-Treaty legend (obverse)&quot;: (&quot;Edward, by the grace of God King of England and France, Lord of Ireland&quot;). Reverse legend: (&quot;But Jesus passing through their midst went His way&quot;).

&quot;Transitional period (1361) and Treaty period (1361–1369) (obverse)&quot;: (Edward by the grace of God King of England Lord of Ireland and Aquitaine). Reverse legend: (&quot;But Jesus passing through their midst went His way&quot;) (many varieties exist and often whole words are missing).

&quot;Post-Treaty period (1369–1377) (obverse)&quot;: (Edward by the grace of God King of England and France Lord of Ireland and Aquitaine). Reverse legend: (&quot;But Jesus passing through their midst went His way&quot;) (many varieties exist and often whole words are missing).

==1377 onwards==
During the reign of King Richard II (1377–99), nobles were struck at both the London and Calais mints, but today they are difficult to obtain. Coins minted at Calais can be distinguished because the ship has a flag at the stern.

&quot;Obverse legend&quot;: (with minor variations in abbreviations) (&quot;Richard by the grace of God King of England and France Lord of Ireland and Aquitaine&quot;). Reverse legend: (many varieties exist) (&quot;But Jesus passing through their midst went His way&quot;).

There exists a variant obverse: – note the omission of the French title.

Nobles produced during the reign of King Henry IV (1399–1413) are divided into the &quot;Heavy Coinage&quot; of 120 grains (7.8 grams) produced until 1412, and the &quot;Light coinage&quot; of 108 grains (7.0 grams) produced in 1412–13. Henrician nobles are a little difficult to distinguish because King Henry V and King Henry VI also produced nobles and at first glance they look very similar, but variations particularly in mintmarks can tell them apart – interested readers are advised to consult a good coin catalogue.

During the Heavy Coinage period, nobles were minted in both London and Calais, the Calais coins again being distinguished by the flag on the stern of the ship. During the Light Coinage period, nobles were only minted in London.

&quot;Obverse legend&quot;: (with many variations in abbreviations) (&quot;Henry by the grace of God King of England and France Lord of Ireland and Aquitaine&quot;) . Reverse legend: (&quot;But Jesus passing through their midst went His way&quot;).

==1413 onwards==

Henry V&#x27;s (1413–22) coins are very similar to those of his father, but there are about seven different varieties of design and style of lettering. The omission of the &quot;and Aquitaine&quot; title is another difference between the coins of Henry IV and V.

&quot;Obverse legend&quot;: (often abbreviated) (&quot;Henry by the grace of God King of England and France Lord of the Irish&quot;). Reverse legend: (&quot;But Jesus passing through their midst went His way&quot;).

Nobles were struck throughout Henry VI&#x27;s first reign (1422–61), but a shortage of gold resulted in fewer coins being struck. There were a number of issues, from both the London and Calais mints, but towards the end of the period the coins were only struck in London. 

&quot;Obverse legend&quot;: (often abbreviated) (&quot;Henry by the grace of God King of England and France Lord of the Irish&quot;). Reverse legend: (&quot;But Jesus passing through their midst went His way&quot;).

In an episode of the British archaeological television series &quot;Time Team&quot;, a gold Noble was unearthed while excavating the drawbridge area of the moat of Codnor Castle. This helped to date the original castle construction and was believed to confirm the participation of the occupants in the Battle of Agincourt.

==1430 onwards==

The gold noble, which had hardly changed in style, value, or quality since the reign of Edward III, was minted for the last time during the first reign of King Edward IV (1461–1470). The price of gold rose from the 1430s onward, so gold coins were worth more in Europe than in England, which resulted in a gold shortage in England as coins were exported for profit. Only a small quantity of nobles were minted during Edward IV&#x27;s Heavy Coinage period (1461–64), at London. Finally, in 1464 in an attempt to stop the coins drifting over to the continent, the value of all gold nobles was raised from six shillings and eight pence (6/8 or 80 pence) to eight shillings and four pence (8/4 or 100 pence), and a new coin, the &quot;Rose Noble, or Royal&quot; worth ten shillings and weighing 120 grains (7.8 grams) was introduced – however, it was unpopular and was discontinued after 1470. In contrast, a new coin worth six shillings and eight pence (the same as the original noble), the angel was introduced in 1464 and soon became a popular and important coin.

&quot;Obverse legend&quot;: (&quot;Edward by the grace of God King of England and France Lord of Ireland&quot;). Reverse legend: (&quot;But Jesus passing through their midst went His way&quot;).

As a notional value, six shilling and eightpence, 6s.8d. or more commonly 6⧸8 (and read as &#x27;six and eight&#x27;) for was useful in certain aspects accounting in what by then was British currency, right up until Decimalisation-Day, Mon. 15 Feb. 1971.

== Shakespeare ==
The noble is present in Shakespeare&#x27;s theatre:

*Henry IV, Part 1
:Hostess: &quot;Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at door would speak with you: he says he comes from your father.&quot;
:Prince Henry: &quot;Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him back again to my mother.&quot;
:The royal refers to the new noble, or royal, worth 10 shillings.
*Henry VI, Part 1:
:Shepard:&quot;&#x27;Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The morn that I was wedded to her mother.&quot;
* Henry V:
:Nym: &quot;I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting?&quot;
:Pistol: &quot;A noble shalt thou have, and present pay;&quot;
* Richard III:
:Gloucester: ...
:&quot;That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble&quot;.
* &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;:
:Benedick: &quot;...noble, or not I for an angel;...&quot;

<doc id="199654" wikidata="Q5421194" url="?curid=199654" title="Experiments on Plant Hybridization">
<text>&quot;Experiments on Plant Hybridization&quot; () is a seminal paper written in 1865 and published in 1866 by Gregor Mendel, an Augustinian friar considered to be the founder of modern genetics. The paper was the result after years spent studying genetic traits in &quot;Pisum sativum&quot;, the pea plant. 

==Content==
In his paper, Mendel compared 7 pairs of discrete traits found in a pea plant:

Through experimentation, Mendel discovered that one inheritable trait would invariably be dominant to its recessive alternative. Mendel laid out the genetic model later known as Mendelian inheritance or Mendelian genetics. This model provided an alternative to blending inheritance, which was the prevailing theory at the time. 

==History==
Mendel read his paper to the Natural History Society of Brünn. It was published in the &quot;Proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn&quot; the following year.

Mendel&#x27;s work received little attention from the scientific community and was largely forgotten. It was not until the early 20th century that Mendel&#x27;s work was rediscovered and his ideas used to help form the modern synthesis.

==Analysis==
In 1936, the statistician Ronald Fisher used a Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test to analyze Mendel&#x27;s data and concluded that Mendel&#x27;s results with the predicted ratios were far too perfect, suggesting that adjustments (intentional or unconscious) had been made to the data to make the observations fit the hypothesis. 

Later authors have suggested Fisher&#x27;s analysis was flawed, proposing various statistical and botanical explanations for Mendel&#x27;s numbers. It is also possible that Mendel&#x27;s results are &quot;too good&quot; merely because he reported the best subset of his data—Mendel mentioned in his paper that the data were from a subset of his experiments.

Modern geneticists have inferred the 7 genes studied by Mendel. It is impossible to know for certain, but the identification is possible to a high degree of confidence based on Mendel&#x27;s description, and the pea varieties grown in central Europe in the 1850s. The table shows that the 7 genes appeared on 5 chromosomes. Of these, the only pair with significant linkage are &quot;V&quot; and &quot;LE&quot;, who are 12.6 map units apart. The other pair, &quot;R&quot; and &quot;GP&quot;, are very weakly linked. The effect is that Mendel was unlikely to have encountered genetic linkage. In any case, he did not report dihybrid experiments on either of these pairs, and only reported on the unlinked pairs, and he always found the ratio to be 9:3:3:1.

<text>An episcopal see is the area of a bishop&#x27;s ecclesiastical jurisdiction.

Phrases concerning actions occurring within or outside an episcopal see are indicative of the geographical significance of the term, making it synonymous with &quot;diocese&quot;.

The word &quot;see&quot; is derived from Latin , which in its original or proper sense denotes the seat or chair that, in the case of a bishop, is the earliest symbol of the bishop&#x27;s authority. This symbolic chair is also known as the bishop&#x27;s . The church in which it is placed is for that reason called the bishop&#x27;s cathedral, from Latin , meaning the &#x27;church of the &#x27;. The word &quot;throne&quot; is also used, especially in the Eastern Orthodox Church, both for the chair and for the area of ecclesiastical jurisdiction.

The term &quot;see&quot; is also used of the town where the cathedral or the bishop&#x27;s residence is located.

== Catholic Church ==
Within Catholicism, each diocese is considered to be a see unto itself with a certain allegiance to the See of Rome. The idea of a see as a sovereign entity is somewhat complicated due to the existence of the twenty-three Particular Eastern Catholic Churches. Both the Western Church and its Eastern Catholic counterparts reserve some level of autonomy, yet each also is subdivided into smaller sees (dioceses and archdioceses). The episcopal see of the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, is known as &quot;the Holy See&quot; or &quot;the Apostolic See&quot;, claiming papal supremacy.

== Eastern Orthodox Church ==
The Eastern Orthodox Church views all bishops as sacramentally equal, and in principle holding equal authority, each over his own see. Certain bishops may be granted additional administrative duties over wider regions (as in the idea of the Pentarchy), but these powers are limited and never extend over the entire Church. Thus, the Eastern Orthodox oppose the idea of papal supremacy or any similar supremacy by any one bishop.

==United Methodist Church==
The United Methodist Church is divided into Annual Conferences, each one of which is presided over by a resident bishop, who is bishop of a named Episcopal Area, or See city. This is usually the Annual Conference&#x27;s largest, or sometimes most centrally located, city. Annual Conferences are the regional bodies which are the fundamental basic bodies of which the United Methodist Global Connection is composed. Annual Conferences are responsible for many matters, including the approval, election and ordination of clergy, who then become members of the Annual Conference in which they are elected and ordained and – with some exceptions – serve within the bounds of for the tenure of their ministries. 

United Methodist Bishops are elected in larger regional conclaves every four years which are known as Jurisdictional Conferences. These super-regional Jurisdictional Conferences comprise an equal number of lay and clergy delegates from each Annual Conference, each delegation determined by the size of the Annual Conference, within the Jurisdiction, and new bishops are elected and consecrated from among the clergy of the Jurisdiction&#x27;s Annual Conferences. These bishops who are elected for life, are then sent to lead the various Annual Conferences of the Jurisdiction. Episcopal candidates are usually – although not always – the first clergy delegate elected from a particular Annual Conference. Each bishop is assigned to and leads for four year terms an Episcopal area, or see, of each Annual Conference. An Episcopal area can also comprise more than one Annual Conference when two smaller Annual Conferences agree to share a bishop.

<text>In geology, rock (or stone) is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloid matter. It is categorized by the minerals included, its chemical composition, and the way in which it is formed. Rocks form the Earth&#x27;s outer solid layer, the crust, and most of its interior, except for the liquid outer core and pockets of magma in the asthenosphere. The study of rocks involves multiple subdisciplines of geology, including petrology and mineralogy. It may be limited to rocks found on Earth, or it may include planetary geology that studies the rocks of other celestial objects.

Rocks are usually grouped into three main groups: igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks. Igneous rocks are formed when magma cools in the Earth&#x27;s crust, or lava cools on the ground surface or the seabed. Sedimentary rocks are formed by diagenesis and lithification of sediments, which in turn are formed by the weathering, transport, and deposition of existing rocks. Metamorphic rocks are formed when existing rocks are subjected to such high pressures and temperatures that they are transformed without significant melting.

Humanity has made use of rocks since the time the earliest humans lived. This early period, called the Stone Age, saw the development of many stone tools. Stone was then used as a major component in the construction of buildings and early infrastructure. Mining developed to extract rocks from the Earth and obtain the minerals within them, including metals. Modern technology has allowed the development of new human-made rocks and rock-like substances, such as concrete.

== Study ==

Geology is the study of Earth and its components, including the study of rock formations. Petrology is the study of the character and origin of rocks. Mineralogy is the study of the mineral components that create rocks. The study of rocks and their components has contributed to the geological understanding of Earth&#x27;s history, the archaeological understanding of human history, and the development of engineering and technology in human society.

While the history of geology includes many theories of rocks and their origins that have persisted throughout human history, the study of rocks was developed as a formal science during the 19th century. Plutonism was developed as a theory during this time, and the discovery of radioactive decay in 1896 allowed for the radiocarbon dating of rocks. Understanding of plate tectonics developed in the second half of the 20th century.

==Classification==

Rocks are composed primarily of grains of minerals, which are crystalline solids formed from atoms chemically bonded into an orderly structure. Some rocks also contain mineraloids, which are rigid, mineral-like substances, such as volcanic glass, that lack crystalline structure. The types and abundance of minerals in a rock are determined by the manner in which it was formed.

Most rocks contain silicate minerals, compounds that include silica tetrahedra in their crystal lattice, and account for about one-third of all known mineral species and about 95% of the earth&#x27;s crust. The proportion of silica in rocks and minerals is a major factor in determining their names and properties.
Rocks are classified according to characteristics such as mineral and chemical composition, permeability, texture of the constituent particles, and particle size. These physical properties are the result of the processes that formed the rocks. Over the course of time, rocks can be transformed from one type into another, as described by a geological model called the rock cycle. This transformation produces three general classes of rock: igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic.

These three classes are subdivided into many groups. There are, however, no hard-and-fast boundaries between allied rocks. By increase or decrease in the proportions of their minerals, they pass through gradations from one to the other; the distinctive structures of one kind of rock may thus be traced, gradually merging into those of another. Hence the definitions adopted in rock names simply correspond to selected points in a continuously graduated series.

===Igneous rock===
Igneous rock (derived from the Latin word &quot;igneus,&quot; meaning &quot;of fire,&quot; from &quot;ignis&quot; meaning &quot;fire)&quot; is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. This magma may be derived from partial melts of pre-existing rocks in either a planet&#x27;s mantle or crust. Typically, the melting of rocks is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition.

Igneous rocks are divided into two main categories:
* Plutonic or intrusive rocks result when magma cools and crystallizes slowly within the Earth&#x27;s crust. A common example of this type is granite.
* Volcanic or extrusive rocks result from magma reaching the surface either as lava or &quot;fragmental ejecta&quot;, forming minerals such as pumice or basalt.

Magmas tend to become richer in silica as they rise towards the Earth&#x27;s surface, a process called &quot;magma differentiation&quot;. This occurs both because minerals low in silica crystallize out of the magma as it begins to cool (Bowen&#x27;s reaction series) and because the magma assimilates some of the crustal rock through which it ascends (&quot;country rock&quot;), and crustal rock tends to be high in silica. Silica content is thus the most important chemical criterion for classifying igneous rock. The content of alkali metal oxides is next in importance.

About 65% of the Earth&#x27;s crust by volume consists of igneous rocks. Of these, 66% are basalt and gabbro, 16% are granite, and 17% granodiorite and diorite. Only 0.6% are syenite and 0.3% are ultramafic. The oceanic crust is 99% basalt, which is an igneous rock of mafic composition. Granite and similar rocks, known as granitoids, dominate the continental crust.

===Sedimentary rock===
Sedimentary rocks are formed at the earth&#x27;s surface by the accumulation and cementation of fragments of earlier rocks, minerals, and organisms or as chemical precipitates and organic growths in water (sedimentation). This process causes clastic sediments (pieces of rock) or organic particles (detritus) to settle and accumulate or for minerals to chemically precipitate (evaporite) from a solution. The particulate matter then undergoes compaction and cementation at moderate temperatures and pressures (diagenesis).

Before being deposited, sediments are formed by weathering of earlier rocks by erosion in a source area and then transported to the place of deposition by water, wind, ice, mass movement or glaciers (agents of denudation). About 7.9% of the crust by volume is composed of sedimentary rocks, with 82% of those being shales, while the remainder consists of 6% limestone and 12% sandstone and arkoses. Sedimentary rocks often contain fossils. Sedimentary rocks form under the influence of gravity and typically are deposited in horizontal or near horizontal layers or strata, and may be referred to as stratified rocks.

Sediment and the particles of clastic sedimentary rocks can be further classified by grain size. The smallest sediments are clay, followed by silt, sand, and gravel. Some systems include cobbles and boulders as measurements.

===Metamorphic rock===
Metamorphic rocks are formed by subjecting any rock type—sedimentary rock, igneous rock or another older metamorphic rock—to different temperature and pressure conditions than those in which the original rock was formed. This process is called metamorphism, meaning to &quot;change in form&quot;. The result is a profound change in physical properties and chemistry of the stone. The original rock, known as the protolith, transforms into other mineral types or other forms of the same minerals, by recrystallization. The temperatures and pressures required for this process are always higher than those found at the Earth&#x27;s surface: temperatures greater than 150 to 200 °C and pressures greater than 1500 bars. This occurs, for example, when continental plates collide. Metamorphic rocks compose 27.4% of the crust by volume.

The three major classes of metamorphic rock are based upon the formation mechanism. An intrusion of magma that heats the surrounding rock causes contact metamorphism—a temperature-dominated transformation. Pressure metamorphism occurs when sediments are buried deep under the ground; pressure is dominant, and temperature plays a smaller role. This is termed burial metamorphism, and it can result in rocks such as jade. Where both heat and pressure play a role, the mechanism is termed regional metamorphism. This is typically found in mountain-building regions.

Depending on the structure, metamorphic rocks are divided into two general categories. Those that possess a texture are referred to as foliated; the remainders are termed non-foliated. The name of the rock is then determined based on the types of minerals present. Schists are foliated rocks that are primarily composed of lamellar minerals such as micas. A gneiss has visible bands of differing lightness, with a common example being the granite gneiss. Other varieties of foliated rock include slates, phyllites, and mylonite. Familiar examples of non-foliated metamorphic rocks include marble, soapstone, and serpentine. This branch contains quartzite—a metamorphosed form of sandstone—and hornfels.

== Extraterrestrial rocks ==

Though most understanding of rocks comes from those of Earth, rocks make up many of the universe&#x27;s celestial bodies. In the Solar System, Mars, Venus, and Mercury are composed of rock, as are many natural satellites, asteroids, and meteoroids. Meteorites that fall to Earth provide evidence of extraterrestrial rocks and their composition. They are typically heavier than rocks on Earth. Asteroid rocks can also be brought to Earth through space missions, such as the &quot;Hayabusa&quot; mission. Lunar rocks and Martian rocks have also been studied.

==Human use==
The use of rock has had a huge impact on the cultural and technological development of the human race. Rock has been used by humans and other hominids for at least 2.5 million years. Lithic technology marks some of the oldest and continuously used technologies. The mining of rock for its metal content has been one of the most important factors of human advancement, and has progressed at different rates in different places, in part because of the kind of metals available from the rock of a region.

=== Anthropic rock ===

Anthropic rock is synthetic or restructured rock formed by human activity. Concrete is recognized as a human-made rock constituted of natural and processed rock and having been developed since Ancient Rome. Rock can also be modified with other substances to develop new forms, such as epoxy granite. Artificial stone has also been developed, such as Coade stone. Geologist James R. Underwood has proposed anthropic rock as a fourth class of rocks alongside igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.

===Building===

Rock varies greatly in strength, from quartzites having a tensile strength in excess of 300 MPa to sedimentary rock so soft it can be crumbled with bare fingers (that is, it is &quot;friable&quot;). (For comparison, structural steel has a tensile strength of around 350 MPa.) Relatively soft, easily worked sedimentary rock was quarried for construction as early as 4000 BCE in Egypt, and stone was used to build fortifications in Inner Mongolia as early as 2800 BCE. The soft rock, tuff, is common in Italy, and the Romans used it for many buildings and bridges. Limestone was widely used in construction in the Middle Ages in Europe and remained popular into the 20th century.

===Mining===
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth, from an ore body, vein or seam. The term also includes the removal of soil. Materials recovered by mining include base metals, precious metals, iron, uranium, coal, diamonds, limestone, oil shale, rock salt, potash, construction aggregate and dimension stone. Mining is required to obtain any material that cannot be grown through agricultural processes, or created artificially in a laboratory or factory. Mining in a wider sense comprises extraction of any resource (e.g. petroleum, natural gas, salt or even water) from the earth.

Mining of rock and metals has been done since prehistoric times. Modern mining processes involve prospecting for mineral deposits, analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine, extraction of the desired materials, and finally reclamation of the land to prepare it for other uses once mining ceases.

Mining processes may create negative impacts on the environment both during the mining operations and for years after mining has ceased. These potential impacts have led to most of the world&#x27;s nations adopting regulations to manage negative effects of mining operations.

=== Tools ===

Stone tools have been used for millions of years by humans and earlier hominids. The Stone Age was a period of widespread stone tool usage. Early Stone Age tools were simple implements, such as hammerstones and sharp flakes. Middle Stone Age tools featured sharpened points to be used as projectile points, awls, or scrapers. Late Stone Age tools were developed with craftsmanship and distinct cultural identities. Stone tools were largely superseded by copper and bronze tools following the development of metallurgy.

<text>Rock (often known by its place of origin, for instance Blackpool rock or Brighton rock) is a type of hard stick-shaped boiled sugar confectionery most usually flavoured with peppermint or spearmint. It is commonly sold at tourist (usually seaside) resorts in the United Kingdom (such as Brighton, Southend-on-Sea, Scarborough, Llandudno or Blackpool) and Ireland (e.g. Bray, Knock or Strandhill); in Gibraltar; in Denmark in towns such as Løkken and Ebeltoft; and in Sydney and Tasmania, Australia.

It usually takes the form of a cylindrical stick (&quot;a stick of rock&quot;), normally in diameter and long. Blackpool rock is usually at least in diameter, and can be as thick as across and up to long when made for special retail displays. These cylinders usually have a pattern embedded throughout the length, which is often the name of the resort where the rock is sold, so that the name can be read on both ends of the stick (reversed at one end) and remains legible even after pieces are bitten off. In the 1830s Morecambe became the first town to produce Rock with letters running through it. Rock is also manufactured as a promotional item, for example with a company name running through it.

It is sometimes found in the form of individual sweets, with writing or a pattern in the centre; these are, in effect, slices of rock.

==Making rock==

Traditional seaside rock is made using granulated sugar and glucose syrup. The mix is approximately 3:1, i.e. three parts sugar to one part glucose syrup. This is mixed together in a pan with enough water to dissolve the sugar (not enough water will result in burning the sugar or the end product being sugary and possibly &quot;graining off&quot;). This is then boiled to approximately or &quot;hard crack&quot; before being poured onto water-cooled steel plates. Once poured, food colourings for the casing and lettering are added and mixed in by hand using a spoon or small palette knife. Once the toffee mixture is poured onto a water-cooled plate, it begins to form a skin underneath; this makes it possible to cut out the colourings, using a pair of shears. The casings and lettering are constantly &quot;turned in&quot; to prevent &quot;chill&quot; (unsightly lumps in the finished product). The remainder of the toffee is stiffened up before going onto a &quot;pulling&quot; machine, a machine that has a fixed arm, and two moving arms, one rotating clockwise, the other anti-clockwise. The pulling machine aerates the toffee, turning it from a solid golden mass into the soft white that forms the centre of the stick of rock. Whilst on the pulling machine, flavourings are added by pouring in measured amounts. A small amount of now white toffee is taken from the pulling machine and used to keep the form of the letters which are made from the coloured toffee.

===Lettering===

Letters are formed by combining thin strips of multi-coloured and white toffee. When they are made, the face of each letter is approximately the size of a thumbprint, not the tiny size seen in the final, stretched product.

The letters are not made in order of appearance in the name (B, L, A, C, K, P, O, O, L) but by their shape; &quot;square&quot; letters, (B, E, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, T, W, X, Y and Z), are made first, as they will not lose their shape, while &quot;triangle&quot; (A and V) and &quot;round&quot; (C, D, G, O, Q, S, U) letters are made last to prevent them from losing their shape, as the toffee is still reasonably soft at this point. For example, the letters that make up &quot;BLACKPOOL ROCK&quot; may be made in this order: B, P, R, K(×2), L(×2), A, C(×2) and O(×3). The individual letters are placed between blocks or sticks at this point, to prevent them from losing shape and going flat. The letters are then placed in their correct spelling order with a &quot;strip&quot; of white, aerated toffee between each letter to make it readable.

Capital letters are the most common form of lettering as small case lettering is far more complicated, owing to their tails and high backs.

=== Finishing ===
The now aerated white toffee from the pulling machine is divided into three parts; one will form the centre and two will form the &quot;flaps&quot;. The flaps are kneaded and spread thinly and evenly before being placed directly onto the letters; these form the space between the casing and letters, and are then wrapped around the stiffened centre. The casing is then kneaded and evenly rolled out, using a rolling pin, and this is then wrapped around the assembled &quot;boiling&quot;, which is one very large bar of rock, usually too thick for a person to encircle in their hands, that is still pliable and warm. This is then placed into a &quot;batch roller&quot;, which has several tapered rollers and heaters. The rollers keep the boiling of rock round and the heaters keep it just soft enough to work.

A worker known as a &quot;sugar boiler&quot; then proceeds to &quot;spin out&quot;, or stretch, the boiling onto a long flat slab, where rollers make sure it is kept rolling until it has set hard enough to maintain its round shape. The process of spinning out is what turns the very thick boiling into the much longer and much thinner final size. Once set, the strings of toffee are cut to length and wrapped in clear paper with a label, known as a &quot;view&quot; as it usually has a view of a landmark.

The whole process of making lettered rock is done by hand by skilled workers. Smaller sticks of rock, without letters or a &quot;view&quot;, can be machine manufactured.

Rock is a different product from rock candy; it more closely resembles a harder candy cane.

===Regional varieties===
Edinburgh rock is another confection, based on sugar and cream of tartar, made into sticks. It is friable and flavoured, for example, with ginger or lemon.

Another distinctively Scottish form of rock is star rock (also sometimes known as starry rock), or &quot;starrie&quot;, which is made in Kirriemuir. It is sold in small bundles of pencil-sized sticks, and is less brittle than seaside rock.

A Dutch type of confection closely resembling rock is the so-called &quot;zuurstok&quot; (sour stick). Like rock with seaside resorts, the &quot;zuurstok&quot; is specifically associated with fairgrounds. Its composition is roughly the same as Edinburgh rock but it comes in a different range of flavours, basically with cream of tartar (thus rendering it more or less sour), but also aromatised with cherry, cinnamon or liquorice for example.

A Swedish variety of the candy is called polkagris.
Japanese &quot;&quot; is made by a similar process.

<doc id="199665" wikidata="Q180556" url="?curid=199665" title="Helicobacter pylori">
<text>Helicobacter pylori, previously known as Campylobacter pylori, is a gram-negative, flagellated, helical bacterium. Mutants can have a rod or curved rod shape that exhibits less virulence. Its helical body (from which the genus name &quot;Helicobacter&quot; derives) is thought to have evolved to penetrate the mucous lining of the stomach, helped by its flagella, and thereby establish infection. The bacterium was first identified as the causal agent of gastric ulcers in 1983 by Australian physician-scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren. In 2005, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery.

Infection of the stomach with &quot;H. pylori&quot; does not necessarily cause illness: over half of the global population is infected, but most individuals are asymptomatic. Persistent colonization with more virulent strains can induce a number of gastric and non-gastric disorders. Gastric disorders due to infection begin with gastritis, or inflammation of the stomach lining. When infection is persistent, the prolonged inflammation will become chronic gastritis. Initially, this will be non-atrophic gastritis, but the damage caused to the stomach lining can bring about the development of atrophic gastritis and ulcers within the stomach itself or the duodenum (the nearest part of the intestine). At this stage, the risk of developing gastric cancer is high. However, the development of a duodenal ulcer confers a comparatively lower risk of cancer. &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; are class 1 carcinogenic bacteria, and potential cancers include gastric MALT lymphoma and gastric cancer. Infection with &quot;H. pylori&quot; is responsible for an estimated 89% of all gastric cancers and is linked to the development of 5.5% of all cases cancers worldwide. &quot;H. pylori&quot; is the only bacterium known to cause cancer.

Extragastric complications that have been linked to &quot;H. pylori&quot; include anemia due either to iron deficiency or vitamin B12 deficiency, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular illness, and certain neurological disorders. An inverse association has also been claimed with &quot;H. pylori&quot; having a positive protective effect against asthma, esophageal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (including gastroesophageal reflux disease and Crohn&#x27;s disease), and others.

Some studies suggest that &quot;H. pylori&quot; plays an important role in the natural stomach ecology by influencing the type of bacteria that colonize the gastrointestinal tract. Other studies suggest that non-pathogenic strains of &quot;H. pylori&quot; may beneficially normalize stomach acid secretion, and regulate appetite.

In 2023, it was estimated that about two-thirds of the world&#x27;s population was infected with &quot;H. pylori&quot;, being more common in developing countries. The prevalence has declined in many countries due to eradication treatments with antibiotics and proton-pump inhibitors, and with increased standards of living.
==Microbiology==
&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; is a species of gram-negative bacteria in the &quot;Helicobacter&quot; genus.
About half the world&#x27;s population is infected with &quot;H. pylori&quot; but only a few strains are pathogenic. &quot;H pylori&quot; is a helical bacterium having a predominantly helical shape, also often described as having a spiral or &quot;S&quot; shape. Its helical shape is better suited for progressing through the viscous mucosa lining of the stomach, and is maintained by a number of enzymes in the cell wall&#x27;s peptidoglycan. The bacteria reach the less acidic mucosa by use of their flagella. Three strains studied showed a variation in length from 2.8–3.3 μm but a fairly constant diameter of 0.55–0.58 μm. &quot;H. pylori&quot; can convert from a helical to an inactive coccoid form that can evade the immune system, and that may possibly become viable, known as viable but nonculturable (VBNC).

&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; is microaerophilic – that is, it requires oxygen, but at lower concentration than in the atmosphere. It contains a hydrogenase that can produce energy by oxidizing molecular hydrogen (H2) made by intestinal bacteria.

&quot;H. pylori&quot; can be demonstrated in tissue by Gram stain, Giemsa stain, H&amp;E stain, Warthin-Starry silver stain, acridine orange stain, and phase-contrast microscopy. It is capable of forming biofilms. Biofilms help to hinder the action of antibiotics and can contribute to treatment failure.

To successfully colonize its host, &quot;H. pylori&quot; uses many different virulence factors including oxidase, catalase, and urease. Urease is the most abundant protein, its expression representing about 10% of the total protein weight.

&quot;H. pylori&quot; possesses five major outer membrane protein families. The largest family includes known and putative adhesins. The other four families are porins, iron transporters, flagellum-associated proteins, and proteins of unknown function. Like other typical gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane of &quot;H. pylori&quot; consists of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The O-antigen of LPS may be fucosylated and mimic Lewis blood group antigens found on the gastric epithelium.

===Genome===
&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; consists of a large diversity of strains, and hundreds of genomes have been completely sequenced. The genome of the strain &quot;26695&quot; consists of about 1.7 million base pairs, with some 1,576 genes. The pan-genome, that is the combined set of 30 sequenced strains, encodes 2,239 protein families (orthologous groups OGs). Among them, 1,248 OGs are conserved in all the 30 strains, and represent the universal core. The remaining 991 OGs correspond to the accessory genome in which 277 OGs are unique to one strain.

There are eleven restriction modification systems in the genome of &quot;H. pylori&quot;. This is an unusually high number providing a defence against bacteriophages.

===Transcriptome===
Single-cell transcriptomics using single-cell RNA-Seq gave the complete transcriptome of &quot;H. pylori&quot; which was published in 2010. This analysis of its transcription confirmed the known acid induction of major virulence loci, including the urease (ure) operon and the Cag pathogenicity island (PAI). A total of 1,907 transcription start sites 337 primary operons, and 126 additional suboperons, and 66 monocistrons were identified. Until 2010, only about 55 transcription start sites (TSSs) were known in this species. 27% of the primary TSSs are also antisense TSSs, indicating that – similar to &quot;E. coli&quot; – antisense transcription occurs across the entire &quot;H. pylori&quot; genome. At least one antisense TSS is associated with about 46% of all open reading frames, including many housekeeping genes. About 50% of the 5 UTRs (leader sequences) are 20–40 nucleotides (nt) in length and support the AAGGag motif located about 6 nt (median distance) upstream of start codons as the consensus Shine–Dalgarno sequence in &quot;H. pylori&quot;.

=== Proteome ===
The proteome of &quot;H. pylori&quot; has been systematically analyzed and more than 70% of its proteins have been detected by mass spectrometry, and other methods. About 50% of the proteome has been quantified, informing of the number of protein copies in a typical cell.

Studies of the interactome have identified more than 3000 protein-protein interactions. This has provided information of how proteins interact with each other, either in stable protein complexes or in more dynamic, transient interactions, which can help to identify the functions of the protein. This in turn helps researchers to find out what the function of uncharacterized proteins is, e.g. when an uncharacterized protein interacts with several proteins of the ribosome (that is, it is likely also involved in ribosome function). About a third of all ~1,500 proteins in &quot;H. pylori&quot; remain uncharacterized and their function is largely unknown.

==Infection==

An infection with &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; can either have no symptoms even when lasting a lifetime, or can harm the stomach and duodenal linings by inflammatory responses induced by several mechanisms associated with a number of virulence factors. Colonization can initially cause &quot;H. pylori induced gastritis&quot;, an inflammation of the stomach lining that became a listed disease in ICD11. This will progress to chronic gastritis if left untreated. Chronic gastritis may lead to atrophy of the stomach lining, and the development of peptic ulcers (gastric or duodenal). These changes may be seen as stages in the development of gastric cancer, known as &quot;Correa&#x27;s cascade&quot;. Extragastric complications that have been linked to &quot;H. pylori&quot; include anemia due either to iron-deficiency or vitamin B12 deficiency, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular, and certain neurological disorders.

Peptic ulcers are a consequence of inflammation that allows stomach acid and the digestive enzyme pepsin to overwhelm the protective mechanisms of the mucous membranes. The location of colonization of &quot;H. pylori&quot;, which affects the location of the ulcer, depends on the acidity of the stomach. In people producing large amounts of acid, &quot;H. pylori&quot; colonizes near the pyloric antrum (exit to the duodenum) to avoid the acid-secreting parietal cells at the fundus (near the entrance to the stomach). G cells express relatively high levels of PD-L1 that protects these cells from &quot;H. pylori&quot;-induced immune destruction. In people producing normal or reduced amounts of acid, &quot;H. pylori&quot; can also colonize the rest of the stomach.
The inflammatory response caused by bacteria colonizing near the pyloric antrum induces G cells in the antrum to secrete the hormone gastrin, which travels through the bloodstream to parietal cells in the fundus. Gastrin stimulates the parietal cells to secrete more acid into the stomach lumen, and over time increases the number of parietal cells, as well. The increased acid load damages the duodenum, which may eventually lead to the formation of ulcers.

&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; is a class I carcinogen, and potential cancers include gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas and gastric cancer. Less commonly, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the stomach is a risk. Infection with &quot;H. pylori&quot; is responsible for around 89 per cent of all gastric cancers, and is linked to the development of 5.5 per cent of all cases of cancer worldwide. Although the data varies between different countries, overall about 1% to 3% of people infected with &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; develop gastric cancer in their lifetime compared to 0.13% of individuals who have had no &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection. &quot;H. pylori&quot;-induced gastric cancer is the third highest cause of worldwide cancer mortality as of 2018. Because of the usual lack of symptoms, when gastric cancer is finally diagnosed it is often fairly advanced. More than half of gastric cancer patients have lymph node metastasis when they are initially diagnosed.

Chronic inflammation that is a feature of cancer development is characterized by infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages to the gastric epithelium, which favors the accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that cause DNA damage. The oxidative DNA damage and levels of oxidative stress can be indicated by a biomarker, 8-oxo-dG. Other damage to DNA includes double-strand breaks.

Small gastric and colorectal polyps are adenomas that are more commonly found in association with the mucosal damage induced by &quot;H. pylori&quot; gastritis. Larger polyps can in time become cancerous. A modest association of &quot;H. pylori&quot; has been made with the development of colorectal cancers, but as of 2020 causality had yet to be proved.

=== Signs and symptoms ===
Most people infected with &quot;H. pylori&quot; never experience any symptoms or complications, but will have a 10% to 20% risk of developing peptic ulcers or a 0.5% to 2% risk of stomach cancer. &quot;H. pylori induced gastritis&quot; may present as acute gastritis with stomach ache, nausea, and ongoing dyspepsia (indigestion) that is sometimes accompanied by depression and anxiety. Where the gastritis develops into chronic gastritis, or an ulcer, the symptoms are the same and can include indigestion, stomach or abdominal pains, nausea, bloating, belching, feeling hunger in the morning, feeling full too soon, and sometimes vomiting, heartburn, bad breath, and weight loss.

Complications of an ulcer can cause severe signs and symptoms such as black or tarry stool indicative of bleeding into the stomach or duodenum; blood - either red or coffee-ground colored in vomit; persistent sharp or severe abdominal pain; dizziness, and a fast heartbeat. Bleeding is the most common complication. In cases caused by &quot;H. pylori&quot; there was a greater need for hemostasis often requiring gastric resection. Prolonged bleeding may cause anemia leading to weakness and fatigue. Inflammation of the pyloric antrum, which connects the stomach to the duodenum, is more likely to lead to duodenal ulcers, while inflammation of the corpus may lead to a gastric ulcer.

Stomach cancer can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and unexplained weight loss. Gastric polyps are adenomas that are usually asymptomatic and benign, but may be the cause of dyspepsia, heartburn, bleeding from the stomach, and, rarely, gastric outlet obstruction. Larger polyps may have become cancerous.
Colorectal polyps may be the cause of rectal bleeding, anemia, constipation, diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain.

==Pathophysiology==
Virulence factors help a pathogen to evade the immune response of the host, and to successfully colonize. The many virulence factors of &quot;H. pylori&quot; include its flagella, the production of urease, adhesins, serine protease HtrA (high temperature requirement A), and the major exotoxins CagA and VacA. The presence of VacA and CagA are associated with more advanced outcomes. CagA is an oncoprotein associated with the development of gastric cancer.
&quot;H. pylori&quot; infection is associated with epigenetically reduced efficiency of the DNA repair machinery, which favors the accumulation of mutations and genomic instability as well as gastric carcinogenesis. It has been shown that expression of two DNA repair proteins, ERCC1 and PMS2, was severely reduced once &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection had progressed to cause dyspepsia. Dyspepsia occurs in about 20% of infected individuals. Epigenetically reduced protein expression of DNA repair proteins MLH1, MGMT and MRE11 are also evident. Reduced DNA repair in the presence of increased DNA damage increases carcinogenic mutations and is likely a significant cause of gastric carcinogenesis. These epigenetic alterations are due to &quot;H. pylori&quot;-induced methylation of CpG sites in promoters of genes and &quot;H. pylori&quot;-induced altered expression of multiple microRNAs.

Two related mechanisms by which &quot;H. pylori&quot; could promote cancer have been proposed. One mechanism involves the enhanced production of free radicals near &quot;H. pylori&quot; and an increased rate of host cell mutation. The other proposed mechanism has been called a &quot;perigenetic pathway&quot;, and involves enhancement of the transformed host cell phenotype by means of alterations in cell proteins, such as adhesion proteins. &quot;H. pylori&quot; has been proposed to induce inflammation and locally high levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), also known as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)), and/or interleukin 6 (IL-6). According to the proposed perigenetic mechanism, inflammation-associated signaling molecules, such as TNF, can alter gastric epithelial cell adhesion and lead to the dispersion and migration of mutated epithelial cells without the need for additional mutations in tumor suppressor genes, such as genes that code for cell adhesion proteins.

===Flagellum===
The first virulence factor of &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; that enables colonization is its flagellum. &quot;H. pylori&quot; has from two to seven flagella at the same polar location which gives it a high motility. The flagellar filaments are about 3 μm long, and composed of two copolymerized flagellins, FlaA and FlaB, coded by the genes &quot;flaA&quot;, and &quot;flaB&quot;. The minor flagellin FlaB is located in the proximal region and the major flagellin FlaA makes up the rest of the flagellum. The flagella are sheathed in a continuation of the bacterial outer membrane which gives protection against the gastric acidity. The sheath is also the location of the origin of the outer membrane vesicles that gives protection to the bacterium from bacteriophages.

Flagella motility is provided by the proton motive force provided by urease-driven hydrolysis allowing chemotactic movements towards the less acidic pH gradient in the mucosa. The mucus layer is about 300 μm thick, and the helical shape of &quot;H. pylori&quot; aided by its flagella helps it to burrow through this layer where it colonises a narrow region of about 25 μm closest to the epithelial cell layer, where the pH is near to neutral. They further colonise the gastric pits and live in the gastric glands. Occasionally the bacteria are found inside the epithelial cells themselves. The use of quorum sensing by the bacteria enables the formation of a biofilm which furthers persistent colonisation. In the layers of the biofilm, &quot;H. pylori&quot; can escape from the actions of antibiotics, and also be protected from host-immune responses. In the biofilm, &quot;H. pylori&quot; can change the flagella to become adhesive structures.

===Urease===

In addition to using chemotaxis to avoid areas of high acidity (low pH), &quot;H. pylori&quot; also produces large amounts of urease, an enzyme which breaks down the urea present in the stomach to produce ammonia and bicarbonate, which are released into the bacterial cytosol and the surrounding environment, creating a neutral area. The decreased acidity (higher pH) changes the mucus layer from a gel-like state to a more viscous state that makes it easier for the flagella to move the bacteria through the mucosa and attach to the gastric epithelial cells. &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; is one of the few known types of bacterium that has a urea cycle which is uniquely configured in the bacterium. 10% of the cell is of nitrogen, a balance that needs to be maintained. Any excess is stored in urea excreted in the urea cycle.

A final stage enzyme in the urea cycle is arginase, an enzyme that is crucial to the pathogenesis of &quot;H. pylori&quot;. Arginase produces ornithine and urea, which the enzyme urease breaks down into carbonic acid and ammonia. Urease is the bacterium’s most abundant protein, accounting for 10–15% of the bacterium&#x27;s total protein content. Its expression is not only required for establishing initial colonization in the breakdown of urea to carbonic acid and ammonia, but is also essential for maintaining chronic infection. Ammonia reduces stomach acidity, allowing the bacteria to become locally established. Arginase promotes the persistence of infection by consuming arginine; arginine is used by macrophages to produce nitric oxide, which has a strong antimicrobial effect. The ammonia produced to regulate pH is toxic to epithelial cells.

===Adhesins===
&quot;H. pylori&quot; must make attachment with the epithelial cells to prevent its being swept away with the constant movement and renewal of the mucus. To give them this adhesion, bacterial outer membrane proteins as virulence factors called adhesins are produced. BabA (blood group antigen binding adhesin) is most important during initial colonization, and SabA (sialic acid binding adhesin) is important in persistence. BabA attaches to glycans and mucins in the epithelium. BabA (coded for by the &quot;babA2&quot; gene) also binds to the Lewis b antigen displayed on the surface of the epithelial cells. Adherence via BabA is acid sensitive and can be fully reversed by a decreased pH. It has been proposed that BabA&#x27;s acid responsiveness enables adherence while also allowing an effective escape from an unfavorable environment such as a low pH that is harmful to the organism. SabA (coded for by the &quot;sabA&quot; gene) binds to increased levels of sialyl-Lewis X antigen expressed on gastric mucosa.

===Cholesterol glucoside===
The outer membrane contains &quot;cholesterol glucoside&quot;, a sterol glucoside that &quot;H. pylori&quot; glycosylates from the cholesterol in the gastric gland cells, and inserts it into its outer membrane. This cholesterol glucoside is important for membrane stability, morphology and immune evasion, and is rarely found in other bacteria.

The enzyme responsible for this is &quot;cholesteryl α-glucosyltransferase&quot; (αCgT or Cgt), encoded by the &quot;HP0421&quot; gene. A major effect of the depletion of host cholesterol by Cgt is to disrupt cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in the epithelial cells. Lipid rafts are involved in cell signalling and their disruption causes a reduction in the immune inflammatory response, particularly by reducing interferon gamma. Cgt is also secreted by the type IV secretion system, and is secreted in a selective way so that gastric niches where the pathogen can thrive are created. Its lack has been shown to give vulnerability from environmental stress to bacteria, and also to disrupt CagA-mediated interactions.

===Catalase===
Colonization induces an intense anti-inflammatory response as a first-line immune system defence. Phagocytic leukocytes and monocytes infiltrate the site of infection, and antibodies are produced. &quot;H. pylori&quot; is able to adhere to the surface of the phagocytes and impede their action. This is responded to by the phagocyte in the generation and release of oxygen metabolites into the surrounding space. &quot;H. pylori&quot; can survive this response by the activity of catalase at its attachment to the phagocytic cell surface. Catalase decomposes hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, protecting the bacteria from toxicity. Catalase has been shown to almost completely inhibit the phagocytic oxidative response. It is coded for by the gene &quot;katA&quot;.

===Tipα===
TNF-inducing protein alpha (Tipα) is a carcinogenic protein encoded by &quot;HP0596&quot; unique to &quot;H. pylori&quot; that induces the expression of tumor necrosis factor. Tipα enters gastric cancer cells where it binds to cell surface nucleolin, and induces the expression of vimentin. Vimentin is important in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition associated with the progression of tumors.

===CagA===
CagA (cytotoxin-associated antigen A) is a major virulence factor for &quot;H. pylori&quot;, an oncoprotein that is encoded by the &quot;cagA&quot; gene. Bacterial strains with the &quot;cagA&quot; gene are associated with the ability to cause ulcers, MALT lymphomas, and gastric cancer. The &quot;cagA&quot; gene codes for a relatively long (1186-amino acid) protein. The &quot;cag&quot; pathogenicity island (PAI) has about 30 genes, part of which code for a complex type IV secretion system (T4SS or TFSS). The low GC-content of the &quot;cag&quot; PAI relative to the rest of the &quot;Helicobacter&quot; genome suggests the island was acquired by horizontal transfer from another bacterial species. The serine protease HtrA also plays a major role in the pathogenesis of &quot;H. pylori&quot;. The HtrA protein enables the bacterium to transmigrate across the host cells&#x27; epithelium, and is also needed for the translocation of CagA.

The virulence of &quot;H. pylori&quot; may be increased by genes of the &quot;cag&quot; pathogenicity island; about 50–70% of &quot;H. pylori&quot; strains in Western countries carry it. Western people infected with strains carrying the &quot;cag&quot; PAI have a stronger inflammatory response in the stomach and are at a greater risk of developing peptic ulcers or stomach cancer than those infected with strains lacking the island. Following attachment of &quot;H. pylori&quot; to stomach epithelial cells, the type IV secretion system expressed by the &quot;cag&quot; PAI &quot;injects&quot; the inflammation-inducing agent, peptidoglycan, from their own cell walls into the epithelial cells. The injected peptidoglycan is recognized by the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor (immune sensor) Nod1, which then stimulates expression of cytokines that promote inflammation.

The type-IV secretion apparatus also injects the &quot;cag&quot; PAI-encoded protein CagA into the stomach&#x27;s epithelial cells, where it disrupts the cytoskeleton, adherence to adjacent cells, intracellular signaling, cell polarity, and other cellular activities. Once inside the cell, the CagA protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by a host cell membrane-associated tyrosine kinase (TK). CagA then allosterically activates protein tyrosine phosphatase/protooncogene Shp2.
These proteins are directly toxic to cells lining the stomach and signal strongly to the immune system that an invasion is under way. As a result of the bacterial presence, neutrophils and macrophages set up residence in the tissue to fight the bacteria assault. Pathogenic strains of &quot;H. pylori&quot; have been shown to activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a membrane protein with a TK domain. Activation of the EGFR by &quot;H. pylori&quot; is associated with altered signal transduction and gene expression in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis. A C-terminal region of the CagA protein (amino acids 873–1002) has also been suggested to be able to regulate host cell gene transcription, independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. A great deal of diversity exists between strains of &quot;H. pylori&quot;, and the strain that infects a person can predict the outcome.

===VacA===
VacA (vacuolating cytotoxin autotransporter) is another major virulence factor encoded by the &quot;vacA&quot; gene. All strains of &quot;H. pylori&quot; carry this gene but there is much diversity, and only 50% produce the encoded cytotoxin. The four main subtypes of &quot;vacA&quot; are &quot;s1/m1, s1/m2, s2/m1,&quot; and &quot;s2/m2&quot;. &quot;s1/m1&quot; and &quot;s1/m2&quot; are known to cause an increased risk of gastric cancer. VacA is an oligomeric protein complex that causes a progressive vacuolation in the epithelial cells leading to their death. The vacuolation has also been associated with promoting intracellular reservoirs of &quot;H. pylori&quot; by disrupting the calcium channel cell membrane TRPML1. VacA has been shown to increase the levels of COX2, an up-regulation that increases the production of a prostaglandin indicating a strong host cell inflammatory response.

===Outer membrane proteins and vesicles===
About 4% of the genome encodes for outer membrane proteins that can be grouped into five families. The largest family includes bacterial adhesins. The other four families are porins, iron transporters, flagellum-associated proteins, and proteins of unknown function. Like other typical gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane of &quot;H. pylori&quot; consists of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The O-antigen of LPS may be fucosylated and mimic Lewis blood group antigens found on the gastric epithelium.

&quot;H. pylori&quot; forms blebs from the outer membrane that pinch off as outer membrane vesicles to provide an alternative delivery system for virulence factors including CagA.

A &quot;Helicobacter&quot; cysteine-rich protein HcpA is known to trigger an immune response, causing inflammation. 
A &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; virulence factor &quot;DupA&quot; is associated with the development of duodenal ulcers.

===Mechanisms of tolerance===
The need for survival has led to the development of different mechanisms of tolerance that enable the persistence of &quot;H. pylori&quot;. These mechanisms can also help to overcome the effects of antibiotics. &quot;H. pylori&quot; has to not only survive the harsh gastric acidity but also the sweeping of mucus by continuous peristalsis, and phagocytic attack accompanied by the release of reactive oxygen species. All organisms encode genetic programs for response to stressful conditions including those that cause DNA damage. Stress conditions activate bacterial response mechanisms that are regulated by proteins expressed by regulator genes. The oxidative stress can induce potentially lethal mutagenic DNA adducts in its genome. Surviving this DNA damage is supported by transformation-mediated recombinational repair, that contributes to successful colonization. &quot;H. pylori&quot; is naturally competent for transformation. While many organisms are competent only under certain environmental conditions, such as starvation, &quot;H. pylori&quot; is competent throughout logarithmic growth.

Transformation (the transfer of DNA from one bacterial cell to another through the intervening medium) appears to be part of an adaptation for DNA repair. Homologous recombination is required for repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs). The AddAB helicase-nuclease complex resects DSBs and loads RecA onto single-strand DNA (ssDNA), which then mediates strand exchange, leading to homologous recombination and repair. The requirement of RecA plus AddAB for efficient gastric colonization suggests that &quot;H. pylori&quot; is either exposed to double-strand DNA damage that must be repaired or requires some other recombination-mediated event. In particular, natural transformation is increased by DNA damage in &quot;H. pylori&quot;, and a connection exists between the DNA damage response and DNA uptake in &quot;H. pylori&quot;. This natural competence contributes to the persistence of &quot;H. pylori&quot;. &quot;H. pylori&quot; has much greater rates of recombination and mutation than other bacteria. Genetically different strains can be found in the same host, and also in different regions of the stomach. An overall response to multiple stressors can result from an interaction of the mechanisms.

RuvABC proteins are essential to the process of recombinational repair, since they resolve intermediates in this process termed Holliday junctions. &quot;H. pylori&quot; mutants that are defective in RuvC have increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and to oxidative stress, exhibit reduced survival within macrophages, and are unable to establish successful infection in a mouse model. Similarly, RecN protein plays an important role in DSB repair. An &quot;H. pylori&quot; recN mutant displays an attenuated ability to colonize mouse stomachs, highlighting the importance of recombinational DNA repair in survival of &quot;H. pylori&quot; within its host.

====Biofilm====
An effective sustained colonization response is the formation of a biofilm.
Having first adhered to cellular surfaces, the bacteria produce and secrete extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). EPS consists largely of biopolymers and provides the framework for the biofilm structure. &quot;H. pylori&quot; helps the biofilm formation by altering its flagella into adhesive structures that provide adhesion between the cells. Layers of aggregated bacteria as microcolonies accumulate to thicken the biofilm.

The matrix of EPS prevents the entry of antibiotics and immune cells, and provides protection from heat and competition from other microorganisms. Channels form between the cells in the biofilm matrix allowing the transport of nutrients, enzymes, metabolites, and waste. Cells in the deep layers may be nutritionally deprived and enter into the coccoid dormant-like state. By changing the shape of the bacterium to a coccoid form, the exposure of LPS (targeted by antibiotics) becomes limited, and so evades detection by the immune system. It has also been shown that the &quot;cag&quot; pathogenicity island remains intact in the coccoid form. Some of these antibiotic resistant cells may remain in the host as persister cells. Following eradication, the persister cells can cause a recurrence of the infection. Bacteria can detach from the biofilm to relocate and colonize elsewhere in the stomach to form other biofilms.

==Diagnosis==

Colonization with &quot;H. pylori&quot; does not always lead to disease, but is associated with a number of stomach diseases. Testing is recommended in cases of peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma; after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer; for first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of indigestion. Other indications that prompt testing for &quot;H. pylori&quot; include long term aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory use, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, or in cases of immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Several methods of testing exist, both invasive and non-invasive.

Non-invasive tests for &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection include serological tests for antibodies, stool tests, and urea breath tests. Carbon urea breath tests include the use of carbon-13, or a radioactive carbon-14 producing a labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath. Carbon urea breath tests have a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of &quot;H. pylori&quot;.

Proton-pump inhibitors and antibiotics should be discontinued for at least 30 days prior to testing for &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection or eradication, as both agents inhibit &quot;H. pylori&quot; growth and may lead to false negative results. Testing to confirm eradication is recommended 30 days or more after completion of treatment for &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection. &quot;H. pylori&quot; breath testing or stool antigen testing are both reasonable tests to confirm eradication. &quot;H. pylori&quot; serologic testing, including IgG antibodies, are not recommended as a test of eradication as they may remain elevated for years after successful treatment of infection.

An endoscopic biopsy is an invasive means to test for &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection. Low-level infections can be missed by biopsy, so multiple samples are recommended. The most accurate method for detecting &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture. Generally, repeating endoscopy is not recommended to confirm &quot;H. pylori&quot; eradication, unless there are specific indications to repeat the procedure.

==Transmission==
&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; is contagious, and is transmitted through direct contact either with saliva (oral-oral) or feces (fecal–oral route), but mainly through the oral–oral route. Consistent with these transmission routes, the bacteria have been isolated from feces, saliva, and dental plaque. &quot;H. pylori&quot; may also be transmitted by consuming contaminated food or water. Transmission occurs mainly within families in developed nations, but also from the broader community in developing countries.

==Prevention==
To prevent the development of &quot;H. pylori&quot;-related diseases when infection is suspected, antibiotic-based therapy regimens are recommended to eradicate the bacteria. When successful the disease progression is halted. First line therapy is recommended if low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is diagnosed, regardless of evidence of &quot;H. pylori&quot;. However, if a severe condition of atrophic gastritis with gastric lesions is reached antibiotic-based treatment regimens are not advised since such lesions are often not reversible and will progress to gastric cancer. If the cancer is managed to be treated it is advised that an eradication program be followed to prevent a recurrence of infection, or reduce a recurrence of the cancer, known as metachronous.
Due to &quot;H. pylori&quot; role as a major cause of certain diseases (particularly cancers) and its consistently increasing resistance to antibiotic therapy, there is an obvious need for alternative treatments. A vaccine targeted towards the development of gastric cancer, including MALT lymphoma, would also prevent the development of gastric ulcers. A vaccine that would be prophylactic for use in children, and one that would be therapeutic later are the main goals. Challenges to this are the extreme genomic diversity shown by &quot;H. pylori&quot; and complex host-immune responses.

Previous studies in the Netherlands and in the US have shown that such a prophylactic vaccine programme would be ultimately cost-effective. However, as of late 2019 there have been no advanced vaccine candidates and only one vaccine in a Phase I clinical trial. Furthermore, development of a vaccine against &quot;H. pylori&quot; has not been a priority of major pharmaceutical companies. A key target for potential therapy is the proton-gated urea channel, since the secretion of urease enables the survival of the bacterium.

==Treatment==
The 2022 Maastricht Consensus Report recognised &quot;H. pylori&quot; gastritis as &quot;Helicobacter pylori induced gastritis&quot;, and has been included in ICD11. Initially the infection tends to be superficial, localised to the upper mucosal layers of the stomach. The intensity of chronic inflammation is related to the cytotoxicity of the &quot;H. pylori&quot; strain. A greater cytotoxicity will result in the change from a non-atrophic gastritis to an atrophic gastritis, with the loss of mucous glands. This condition is a prequel to the development of peptic ulcers and gastric adenocarcinoma.

Eradication of &quot;H. pylori&quot; is recommended to treat the infection, including when advanced to peptic ulcer disease. The recommendations for first-line treatment is a quadruple therapy consisting of a proton-pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole. Prior to treatment, testing is recommended to identify any pre-existing antibiotic resistances. A high rate of resistance to metronidazole has been observed. In areas of known clarithromycin resistance, the first-line therapy is changed to a bismuth based regimen including tetracycline and metronidazole for 14 days. If one of these courses of treatment fails, it is suggested to use the alternative.

Treatment failure may typically be attributed to antibiotic resistance, or inadequate acid suppression from proton-pump inhibitors. Following clinical trials, the use of the potassium-competitive acid blocker vonoprazan, which has a greater acid suppressive action, was approved for use in the US in 2022. Its recommended use is in combination with amoxicillin, with or without clarithromycin. It has been shown to have a faster action and can be used with or without food. Successful eradication regimens have revolutionised the treatment of peptic ulcers. Eradication of &quot;H. pylori&quot; is also associated with a subsequent decreased risk of duodenal or gastric ulcer recurrence.

Plant extracts and probiotic foods are being increasingly used as add-ons to usual treatments. Probiotic yogurts containing lactic acid bacteria &quot;Bifidobacteria&quot; and &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; exert a suppressive effect on &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection, and their use has been shown to improve the rates of eradication. Some commensal intestinal bacteria as part of the gut microbiota produce butyrate that acts as a prebiotic and enhances the mucosal immune barrier. Their use as probiotics may help balance the gut dysbiosis that accompanies antibiotic use. Some probiotic strains have been shown to have bactericidal and bacteriostatic activity against &quot;H. pylori&quot;, and also help to balance the gut dysbiosis. Antibiotics have a negative impact on gastrointestinal microbiota and cause nausea, diarrhea, and sickness for which probiotics can alleviate.

=== Antibiotic resistance ===
Increasing antibiotic resistance is the main cause of initial treatment failure. Factors linked to resistance include mutations, efflux pumps, and the formation of biofilms. One of the main antibiotics used in eradication therapies is clarithromycin, but clarithromycin-resistant strains have become well-established and the use of alternative antibiotics needs to be considered. Fortunately, non-invasive stool tests for clarithromycin have become available that allow selection of patients that are likely to respond to the therapy. Multidrug resistance has also increased. Additional rounds of antibiotics or other therapies may be used. Next generation sequencing is looked to for identifying initial specific antibiotic resistances that will help in targeting more effective treatment.

In 2018, the WHO listed &quot;H. pylori&quot; as a high priority pathogen for the research and discovery of new drugs and treatments. The increasing antibiotic resistance encountered has spurred interest in developing alternative therapies using a number of plant compounds. Plant compounds have fewer side effects than synthetic drugs. Most plant extracts contain a complex mix of components that may not act on their own as antimicrobials but can work together with antibiotics to enhance treatment and work towards overcoming resistance. Plant compounds have a different mechanism of action that has proved useful in fighting antimicrobial resistance. For example, various compounds can act by inhibiting enzymes such as urease, and weakening adhesions to the mucous membrane. Sulfur-containing compounds from plants with high concentrations of polysulfides, coumarins, and terpenes have all been shown to be effective against &quot;H. pylori&quot;.

&quot;H. pylori&quot; is found in saliva and dental plaque. Its transmission is known to include oral-oral, suggesting that the dental plaque biofilm may act as a reservoir for the bacteria. Periodontal therapy or scaling and root planing has therefore been suggested as an additional treatment to enhance eradication rates, but more research is needed.

=== Cancers ===

==== Stomach cancer ====

&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; is a risk factor for gastric adenocarcinomas. Treatment is highly aggressive, with even localized disease being treated sequentially with chemotherapy and radiotherapy before surgical resection. Since this cancer, once developed, is independent of &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection, eradication regimens are not used.

==== Gastric MALT lymphoma and DLBCL====

MALT lymphomas are malignancies of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Early gastric MALTomas due to &quot;H. pylori&quot; may be successfully treated (70–95% of cases) with one or more eradication programs. Some 50–80% of patients who experience eradication of the pathogen develop a remission and long-term clinical control of their lymphoma within 3–28 months. Radiation therapy to the stomach and surrounding (i.e. peri-gastric) lymph nodes has also been used to successfully treat these localized cases. Patients with non-localized (i.e. systemic Ann Arbor stage III and IV) disease who are free of symptoms have been treated with watchful waiting or, if symptomatic, with the immunotherapy drug rituximab (given for 4 weeks) combined with the chemotherapy drug chlorambucil for 6–12 months; 58% of these patients attain a 58% progression-free survival rate at 5 years. Frail stage III/IV patients have been successfully treated with rituximab or the chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide alone. Antibiotic-proton pump inhibitor eradication therapy and localized radiation therapy have been used successfully to treat H. pylori-positive MALT lymphomas of the rectum; however radiation therapy has given slightly better results and therefore been suggested to be the disease&#x27;s preferred treatment. However, the generally recognized treatment of choice for patients with systemic involvement uses various chemotherapy drugs often combined with rituximab.

A MALT lymphoma may rarely transform into a more aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Where this is associated with &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection, the DLBCL is less aggressive and more amenable to treatment. When limited to the stomach, they have sometimes been successfully treated with &quot;H. pylori&quot; eradication programs. If unresponsive or showing a deterioration, a more conventional chemotherapy (CHOP), immunotherapy, or local radiotherapy can be considered, and any of these or a combination have successfully treated these more advanced types.

==Prognosis==
&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; colonizes the stomach for decades in most people, and induces chronic gastritis, a long-lasting inflammation of the stomach. In most 
cases symptoms are never experienced but about 10–20% of those infected will ultimately develop gastric and duodenal ulcers, and have a possible 1–2% lifetime risk of gastric cancer.

&quot;H. pylori&quot; thrives in a high salt diet, which is seen as an environmental risk factor for its association with gastric cancer. A diet high in salt enhances colonization, increases inflammation, increases the expression of &quot;H. pylori&quot; virulence factors, and intensifies chronic gastritis. Paradoxically, extracts of kimchi, a salted probiotic food, has been found to have a preventive effect on &quot;H. pylori&quot;–associated gastric carcinogenesis.

In the absence of treatment, &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection usually persists for life. Infection may disappear in the elderly as the stomach&#x27;s mucosa becomes increasingly atrophic and inhospitable to colonization. Some studies in young children up to two years of age have shown that infection can be transient in this age group.

It is possible for &quot;H. pylori&quot; to re-establish in a person after eradication. This recurrence can be caused by the original strain (&quot;recrudescence&quot;), or be caused by a different strain (&quot;reinfection&quot;). A 2017 meta-analysis showed that the global per-person annual rates of recurrence, reinfection, and recrudescence is 4.3%, 3.1%, and 2.2% respectively. It is unclear what the main risk factors are.

Mounting evidence suggests &quot;H. pylori&quot; has an important role in protection from some diseases. The incidence of acid reflux disease, Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, and esophageal cancer have been rising dramatically at the same time as &quot;H. pylori&quot;″s presence decreases. In 1996, Martin J. Blaser advanced the hypothesis that &quot;H. pylori&quot; has a beneficial effect by regulating the acidity of the stomach contents. The hypothesis is not universally accepted, as several randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate worsening of acid reflux disease symptoms following eradication of &quot;H. pylori&quot;. Nevertheless, Blaser has reasserted his view that &quot;H. pylori&quot; is a member of the normal gastric microbiota. He postulates that the changes in gastric physiology caused by the loss of &quot;H. pylori&quot; account for the recent increase in incidence of several diseases, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and asthma. His group has recently shown that &quot;H. pylori&quot; colonization is associated with a lower incidence of childhood asthma.

==Epidemiology==
In 2023, it was estimated that about two-thirds of the world&#x27;s population were infected with &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection, being more common in developing countries. &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection is more prevalent in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East. The global prevalence declined markedly in the decade following 2010, with a particular reduction in Africa.

The age when someone acquires this bacterium seems to influence the pathologic outcome of the infection. People infected at an early age are likely to develop more intense inflammation that may be followed by atrophic gastritis with a higher subsequent risk of gastric ulcer, gastric cancer, or both. Acquisition at an older age brings different gastric changes more likely to lead to duodenal ulcer. Infections are usually acquired in early childhood in all countries. However, the infection rate of children in developing nations is higher than in industrialized nations, probably due to poor sanitary conditions, perhaps combined with lower antibiotics usage for unrelated pathologies. In developed nations, it is currently uncommon to find infected children, but the percentage of infected people increases with age. The higher prevalence among the elderly reflects higher infection rates incurred in childhood. In the United States, prevalence appears higher in African-American and Hispanic populations, most likely due to socioeconomic factors. The lower rate of infection in the West is largely attributed to higher hygiene standards and widespread use of antibiotics. Despite high rates of infection in certain areas of the world, the overall frequency of &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection is declining. However, antibiotic resistance is appearing in &quot;H. pylori&quot;; many metronidazole- and clarithromycin-resistant strains are found in most parts of the world.

==History==
&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; migrated out of Africa along with its human host around 60,000 years ago. Research has shown that genetic diversity in &quot;H. pylori&quot;, like that of its host, decreases with geographic distance from East Africa. Using the genetic diversity data, researchers have created simulations that indicate the bacteria seem to have spread from East Africa around 58,000 years ago. Their results indicate modern humans were already infected by &quot;H. pylori&quot; before their migrations out of Africa, and it has remained associated with human hosts since that time.

&quot;H. pylori&quot; was first discovered in the stomachs of patients with gastritis and ulcers in 1982 by Barry Marshall and Robin Warren of Perth, Western Australia. At the time, the conventional thinking was that no bacterium could live in the acid environment of the human stomach. In recognition of their discovery, Marshall and Warren were awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Before the research of Marshall and Warren, German scientists found spiral-shaped bacteria in the lining of the human stomach in 1875, but they were unable to culture them, and the results were eventually forgotten. The Italian researcher Giulio Bizzozero described similarly shaped bacteria living in the acidic environment of the stomach of dogs in 1893. Professor Walery Jaworski of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków investigated sediments of gastric washings obtained by lavage from humans in 1899. Among some rod-like bacteria, he also found bacteria with a characteristic spiral shape, which he called &quot;Vibrio rugula&quot;. He was the first to suggest a possible role of this organism in the pathogenesis of gastric diseases. His work was included in the &quot;Handbook of Gastric Diseases&quot;, but it had little impact, as it was published only in Polish. Several small studies conducted in the early 20th century demonstrated the presence of curved rods in the stomachs of many people with peptic ulcers and stomach cancers. Interest in the bacteria waned, however, when an American study published in 1954 failed to observe the bacteria in 1180 stomach biopsies.

Interest in understanding the role of bacteria in stomach diseases was rekindled in the 1970s, with the visualization of bacteria in the stomachs of people with gastric ulcers. The bacteria had also been observed in 1979, by Robin Warren, who researched it further with Barry Marshall from 1981. After unsuccessful attempts at culturing the bacteria from the stomach, they finally succeeded in visualizing colonies in 1982, when they unintentionally left their Petri dishes incubating for five days over the Easter weekend. In their original paper, Warren and Marshall contended that most stomach ulcers and gastritis were caused by bacterial infection and not by stress or spicy food, as had been assumed before.

Some skepticism was expressed initially, but within a few years multiple research groups had verified the association of &quot;H. pylori&quot; with gastritis and, to a lesser extent, ulcers. To demonstrate &quot;H. pylori&quot; caused gastritis and was not merely a bystander, Marshall drank a beaker of &quot;H. pylori&quot; culture. He became ill with nausea and vomiting several days later. An endoscopy 10 days after inoculation revealed signs of gastritis and the presence of &quot;H. pylori&quot;. These results suggested &quot;H. pylori&quot; was the causative agent. Marshall and Warren went on to demonstrate antibiotics are effective in the treatment of many cases of gastritis. In 1994, the National Institutes of Health stated most recurrent duodenal and gastric ulcers were caused by &quot;H. pylori&quot;, and recommended antibiotics be included in the treatment regimen.

The bacterium was initially named &quot;Campylobacter pyloridis&quot;, then renamed &quot;C. pylori&quot; in 1987 (&quot;pylori&quot; being the genitive of &quot;pylorus&quot;, the circular opening leading from the stomach into the duodenum, from the Ancient Greek word &quot;πυλωρός&quot;, which means gatekeeper). When 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and other research showed in 1989 that the bacterium did not belong in the genus &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, it was placed in its own genus, &quot;Helicobacter&quot; from the Ancient Greek &quot;έλιξ&quot; (&quot;hělix&quot;) &quot;spiral&quot; or &quot;coil&quot;.

In October 1987, a group of experts met in Copenhagen to found the European Helicobacter Study Group (EHSG), an international multidisciplinary research group and the only institution focused on &quot;H. pylori&quot;. The Group is involved with the Annual International Workshop on Helicobacter and Related Bacteria, (renamed as the European Helicobacter and Microbiota Study Group), the Maastricht Consensus Reports (European Consensus on the management of &quot;H. pylori&quot;), and other educational and research projects, including two international long-term projects:
* European Registry on &quot;H. pylori&quot; Management (Hp-EuReg) – a database systematically registering the routine clinical practice of European gastroenterologists.
* Optimal &quot;H. pylori&quot; management in primary care (OptiCare) – a long-term educational project aiming to disseminate the evidence based recommendations of the Maastricht IV Consensus to primary care physicians in Europe, funded by an educational grant from United European Gastroenterology.

== Research ==
Results from &quot;in vitro&quot; studies suggest that fatty acids, mainly polyunsaturated fatty acids, have a bactericidal effect against &quot;H. pylori&quot;, but their &quot;in vivo&quot; effects have not been proven.

The antibiotic resistance provided by biofilms has generated much research into targeting the mechanisms of quorum sensing used in the formation of biofilms.

A suitable vaccine for &quot;H. pylori&quot;, either prophylactic or therapeutic, is an ongoing research aim. The Murdoch Children&#x27;s Research Institute is working at developing a vaccine that instead of specifically targeting the bacteria, aims to inhibit the inflammation caused that leads to the associated diseases.

Gastric organoids can be used as models for the study of &quot;H. pylori&quot; pathogenesis.

<text>Centrino was a brand name of Intel Corporation which represented its Wi-Fi and WiMAX wireless computer networking adapters. The brand name was first used by the company as a platform-marketing initiative. The change of the meaning of the brand name occurred on January 7, 2010. The Centrino name for laptops was replaced by the Ultrabook.

The old platform-marketing brand name covered a particular combination of mainboard chipset, mobile CPU and wireless network interface in the design of a laptop. Intel claimed that systems equipped with these technologies delivered better performance, longer battery life and broader wireless network interoperability than non-Centrino systems.

The product line name for Intel wireless products became Intel Centrino Wireless in 2010. The Centrino brand was ultimately discontinued in 2013.

== Intel Centrino ==
==Notebook implementations==

===Carmel platform (2003)===
Intel used &quot;Carmel&quot; as the codename for the first-generation Centrino platform, introduced in March 2003.

Industry-watchers initially criticized the Carmel platform for its lack of support for IEEE 802.11g, because many independent Wi-Fi chip-makers like Broadcom and Atheros had already started shipping 802.11g products. Intel responded that the IEEE had not finalized the 802.11g standard at the time of Carmel&#x27;s announcement.
In early 2004, after the finalization of the 802.11g standard, Intel permitted an Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG to substitute for the 2100. At the same time, they permitted the new Dothan Pentium M to substitute for the Banias Pentium M. Initially, Intel permitted only the 855GM chipset, which did not support external graphics. Later, Intel allowed the 855GME and 855PM chips, which did support external graphics, in Centrino laptops.

Despite criticisms, the Carmel platform won quick acceptance among OEMs and consumers. Carmel could attain or exceed the performance of older Pentium 4-M platforms, while allowing for laptops to operate for 4 to 5 hours on a 48 W-h battery. Carmel also allowed laptop manufacturers to create thinner and lighter laptops because its components did not dissipate much heat, and thus did not require large cooling systems.

===Sonoma platform (2005)===
Intel used Sonoma as the codename for the second-generation Centrino platform, introduced in January 2005.

The Mobile 915 Express chipset, like its desktop version, supports many new features such as DDR2, PCI Express, Intel High Definition Audio, and SATA. Unfortunately, the introduction of PCI Express and faster Pentium M processors causes laptops built around the Sonoma platform to have a shorter battery-life than their Carmel counterparts; Sonoma laptops typically achieve between 3.5–4.6 hours of battery-life on a 53 W-h battery.

===Napa platform (2006)===
The codename Napa designates the third-generation Centrino platform, introduced in January 2006 at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show. The platform initially supported Intel Core Duo processors but the newer Core 2 Duo processors were launched and supported in this platform from July 27, 2006 onwards.
Intel uses Centrino Duo branding for laptops with dual-core Core Duo processors and retains the Centrino name for laptops with single core (Core Solo) processors. Some of the initial Core Duo laptops are still labeled as Intel Centrino rather than Centrino Duo.

===Santa Rosa platform (2007)===

The codename Santa Rosa refers to the fourth-generation Centrino platform, which was released on May 10, 2007.
The Santa Rosa platform comes with dynamic acceleration technology, allowing single threaded applications to execute faster. When a single threaded application is running, the CPU can turn off one of its cores and overclock the active core. In this way the CPU maintains the same Thermal Profile as it would when both cores are active. Santa Rosa performs well as a mobile gaming platform due to its ability to switch between single threaded and multithreaded tasks. Other power savings come from an Enhanced Sleep state where both the CPU cores and the chipset will power down.

The wireless chipset update was originally intended to include WWAN Internet access via HSDPA (3.5G), (codenamed Windigo) co-developed with Nokia. After announcing a working partnership, both later retracted the deal citing the lack of a clear business case for the technology. Support for WiMAX (802.16) was originally scheduled for inclusion in Santa Rosa but was later delayed until Montevina in 2008.

It is branded as &quot;Centrino Pro&quot; when combined with the enhanced security technologies Intel introduced with vPro and &quot;Centrino Duo&quot; when they are not used.

===Montevina platform (2008)===
The codename Montevina refers to the fifth-generation Centrino platform, now formally named Centrino 2 to avoid confusion with previous Centrino platforms. It was scheduled for release at Computex Taipei 2008, which took place on June 3–7, 2008, but was delayed until July 15, due to problems with integrated graphics and wireless certification.
It is branded as &quot;Centrino 2 vPro&quot; when combined with built-in security and manageability features technologies.

===Calpella platform (2009)===
The codename Calpella refers to the sixth-generation Centrino platform. Though originally scheduled to premiere in Q3 2009 with the second iteration of Nehalem processors, Intel had stated that due to pressure from computer manufacturers, they would delay the release of the platform until at least October 2009 (Q4 2009) to allow OEM partners to clear excess inventory of existing chips. This was believed to be spurred by the lowered demand due to unfavorable economic conditions throughout 2009.
===Huron River platform (2011)===
The codename Huron River refers to the seventh-generation Centrino platform.
===Chief River platform (2012)===
The codename Chief River refers to the eighth-generation Centrino platform.
===Shark Bay platform (2013)===
The codename Shark Bay refers to the ninth-generation Centrino platform.
Jon Worrel predicted in 2012 that Shark Bay would comprise a single Multi-Chip Module (MCM) package.

==Mobile Internet Device==
===Menlow platform (2008)===
On March 2, 2008, Intel introduced the Intel Atom processor brand for a new family of low-power processor platforms. The components have thin, small designs and work together to &quot;enable the best mobile computing and Internet experience&quot; on mobile and low-power devices.

Intel&#x27;s second generation MID platform (codenamed Menlow) contains a 45 nm Intel Atom processor (codenamed Silverthorne) which can run up to 2.0 GHz and a System Controller Hub (codenamed Poulsbo) which includes Intel HD Audio (codenamed Azalia).

This platform was initially branded as Centrino Atom but the logo was dropped in August 2008; the logo had caused confusion between laptop and MID with previous marketing of Centrino stating only Intel chipsets are being used. Hence MIDs will be branded as Atom to allow integration with other OEM chipsets for the low-end market.

===Intel Centrino Wireless===

Intel Centrino Wireless was the brand for Intel Wi-Fi and WiMAX adapters from 2010 to 2013. The product line included:
*Intel Centrino Wireless-N 1000
*Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6200
*Intel Centrino Ultimate-N 6300
*Intel Centrino Advanced-N + WiMAX 6250

==Centrino with Intel vPro technology==

Laptops with Intel vPro technology have hardware features that allow a system administrator to remotely access wired and wireless laptops for maintenance and servicing if the operating system is unresponsive or crashed and, when a laptop is connected to AC power (not on battery power), allow a sys-admin to remotely access the laptop when the system is asleep or laptop power is off. It is targeted more for businesses than consumers.
* Centrino laptop with Intel vPro technology (Santa Rosa platform)
* Centrino 2 laptop with Intel vPro technology (Montevina platform)

===Security technologies===
Laptops with vPro have the typical dual-core or quad-core processor and wireless features of the Centrino family.
* The vPro technology built into the chipset adds management, security, and remote-deployment features for: monitoring laptops (protected event logs, access to BIOS settings, out-of-band alerting, protected data storage), maintaining and updating systems (access to protected system information, remote power up, console redirection), repairing systems (remote boot, console redirection, preboot access to BIOS settings, protected events logs), and securing systems (remote power up, hardware filters for network traffic, agent presence checks/triggers, out-of-band alerting).
* The 45 nm Centrino 2 package is based on the Penryn microprocessor and Q47/Q45 chipset. It includes a better graphics engine (integrated) than Centrino, and three key additional features: Transport Layer Security (TLS) secured communications over an open local area network (LAN) for wired laptops outside the corporate firewall (not supported for wireless states), support for Microsoft Network Access Protection (NAP), and support for out-of-band management and security features in Sx (all sleep states) when the laptop is inside the corporate firewall.

<doc id="199672" wikidata="Q856732" url="?curid=199672" title="Pentium M">
<text>The Pentium M is a family of mobile 32-bit single-core x86 microprocessors (with the modified Intel P6 microarchitecture) introduced in March 2003 and forming a part of the Intel [[Centrino#Carmel platform (2003)|Carmel]] notebook platform under the then new Centrino brand. The &quot;Pentium M&quot; processors had a maximum thermal design power (TDP) of 5–27 W depending on the model, and were intended for use in laptops (thus the &quot;M&quot; suffix standing for &quot;mobile&quot;). They evolved from the core of the last Pentium III–branded CPU by adding the front-side bus (FSB) interface of Pentium 4, an improved instruction decoding and issuing front end, improved branch prediction, SSE2 support, and a much larger cache.

The Pentium M replaced the laptop version of the Pentium 4 (the &quot;Pentium 4-Mobile&quot;, or &quot;P4-M&quot;), which suffered from power consumption and heat problems. The first Pentium M–branded CPU, code-named Banias, was followed by Dothan. The Pentium M line was removed from the official price lists in July 2009, when the Pentium M-branded processors were succeeded by the Core-branded dual-core mobile Yonah CPU with a modified microarchitecture.

== Overview ==
The Pentium M represented a new and radical departure for Intel, as it was not a low-power version of the desktop-oriented Pentium 4, but instead a heavily modified version of the Pentium III Tualatin design (itself based on the Pentium II core design, which in turn had been a heavily improved evolution of the Pentium Pro). It is optimized for power efficiency, a vital characteristic for extending notebook computer battery life. Running with very low average power consumption and much lower heat output than desktop processors, the Pentium M runs at a lower clock speed than the laptop version of the Pentium 4 (the &quot;Pentium 4-Mobile&quot;, or &quot;P4-M&quot;), but with similar performance – a 1.6 GHz Pentium M can typically attain or even surpass the performance of a 2.4 GHz Pentium 4-M. The Pentium M 740 has been tested to perform up to approximately 7,400 MIPS and 3.9 GFLOPS (using SSE2).

The Pentium M coupled the execution core of the Pentium III with a Pentium 4 compatible bus interface, an improved instruction decoding/issuing front end, improved branch prediction, SSE2 support, and a much larger cache. The usually power-hungry secondary cache uses an access method which only switches on the portion being accessed. The main intention behind the large cache was to keep a decent-sized portion of it still available to the processor even when most of the L2 cache was switched off, but its size led to a welcome improvement in performance.

Other power saving methods include dynamically variable clock frequency and core voltage, allowing the Pentium M to throttle clock speed when the system is idle in order to conserve energy, using the SpeedStep 3 technology (which has more sleep stages than previous versions of SpeedStep). With this technology, a 1.6 GHz Pentium M can effectively throttle to clock speeds of 600 MHz, 800 MHz, 1000 MHz, 1200 MHz, 1400 MHz and 1600 MHz; these intermediate clock states allow the CPU to better throttle clock speed to suit conditions. The power requirements of the Pentium M varies from 5 watts when idle to 27 watts at full load. This is useful to notebook manufacturers as it allows them to include the Pentium M into smaller notebooks.

Although Intel marketed the Pentium M exclusively as a mobile product, motherboard manufacturers such as AOpen, DFI and MSI shipped Pentium M compatible boards designed to non-mobile enthusiasts, HTPC, workstation and server applications. An adapter, the CT-479, was developed by ASUS to allow the use of Pentium M processors in selected ASUS motherboards designed for Socket 478 Pentium 4 processors. Shuttle Inc. offered packaged Pentium M desktops, marketed for low energy consumption and minimal cooling system noise. Pentium M processors are also of interest to embedded systems&#x27; manufacturers because the low power consumption of the Pentium M allows the design of fanless and miniaturized embedded PCs. The Pentium M also responds very well to undervolting, which can be done with the program Notebook Hardware Control or RMClock.

== Banias ==

The Intel Haifa team had previously been working on the memory controller for Timna, which was based on earlier P6 memory controller designs giving them detailed knowledge of P6 architecture which they used when Intel gave them a crash project to create a backup mobile CPU. As the M line was originally designed in Israel, the first Pentium M was identified by the codename Banias, named after an ancient site in the Golan Heights. Given the product code 80535, it initially had no model number suffix, but was later identified as the Pentium M 705. It was manufactured on a 130 nm process, was released at frequencies from 900 MHz to 1.7 GHz using a 400 MT/s FSB, and had 1 megabyte (MB) of Level 2 cache. The core average TDP (Thermal Design Power) is 24.5 watts.

The Banias family processors internally support Physical Address Extension (PAE) but do not show the PAE support flag in their CPUID information; this causes some operating systems (primarily Linux distributions) to refuse to boot on such processors since PAE support is required in their kernels. Using the &#x27;forcepae&#x27; Linux boot option will allow Linux to boot using PAE in these cases. Windows 8 and later also refuses to boot on these processors for the same reason, as they specifically require PAE support to run properly. Attempting to boot Windows 8 and later with these processors installed (as well as on early Dothan family processors without PAE support flag enabled in their CPUID info) will result in a crash when attempting to load ntoskrnl.exe early on in the boot process, with error code 0xc0000260 (UNSUPPORTED_PROCESSOR).

== Dothan ==

On September 17, 2003, Intel unveiled plans for releasing its then next-generation of Pentium M processors, codenamed &quot;Dothan&quot; by them. It was named after another ancient town in Israel, and it launched formally on May 10, 2004. Dothan Pentium M processors (product code 80536, CPUID 0x6DX) are among the first Intel processors to be identified using a &quot;processor number&quot; rather than a clockspeed rating; this allowed for more precise distinctions between different kinds of processors. The initial Dothan versions with the 400MT/s Front-Side-Bus (FSB) are known as Pentium M 710 (1.4 GHz), 715 (1.5 GHz), 725 (1.6 GHz), 735 (1.7 GHz), 745 (1.8 GHz), 755 (2.0 GHz), and 765 (2.1 GHz). These initial Dothan models all have a TDP of 21 W and a 2 MB L2 cache.

These 700 series Dothan Pentium M processors retain the same basic design as the original Banias Pentium M, but are manufactured on a 90 nm process, with twice the secondary cache. Die size, at 87 mm2, remains in the same neighborhood as the original Pentium M, even though the 1000 series contains approximately 140 million transistors, most of which make up the 2 MB cache. TDP is also down to 21 watts with the 400 MT/s FSB (from 24.5 watts in Banias), though power use at lower clockspeeds has increased highly. However, tests conducted by third party hardware review sites show that Banias and Dothan equipped notebooks have roughly equivalent battery life.
Additionally third party hardware review sites have benchmarked the Dothan at approx 10-20% better performance than the Banias in most situations.

Revisions of the Dothan core were released in the first quarter of 2005 with the Sonoma chipsets and supported a 533 MT/s FSB and XD (Intel&#x27;s name for the NX bit); and the PAE support flag in the CPUID was enabled, unlike earlier Pentium Ms that showed PAE unavailable. This resolved boot errors in Linux distributions as well as with Windows 8 and later. These revised Dothan processors include the 730 (1.6 GHz), 740 (1.73 GHz), 750 (1.86 GHz), 760 (2.0 GHz), 770 (2.13 GHz) and 780 (2.26 GHz) and have a TDP of 27 W and a 2 MB L2 cache.

In July 2005, Intel released the 780 (2.26 GHz) and the low-voltage 778 (1.60 GHz).

The processor line had models running at clock speeds from 1.0 GHz to 2.26 GHz . The models with lower frequencies were either low voltage or ultra-low voltage CPUs designed for improved battery life and reduced heat output. The 718 (1.3 GHz), 738 (1.4 GHz), and 758 (1.5 GHz) models are low-voltage (1.116 V) with a TDP of 10 W, while the 723 (1.0 GHz), 733 (1.1 GHz), and 753 (1.2 GHz) models are ultra-low voltage (0.940 V) with a TDP of 5 W.

== Intel A100 series ==

An ultra low-power microprocessor based on the Dothan built on a 90 nm process with 512 KB L2 cache and 400 MT/s front side bus (FSB).

== Core Solo and Core Duo ==

The next generation of processors, codenamed Yonah, were based on the Enhanced Pentium M architecture, and released under the Intel Core brand, as Core Duo and Core Solo.

<text>The AN/USQ-17 or Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) computer referred to in Sperry Rand documents as the Univac M-460, was Seymour Cray&#x27;s last design for UNIVAC. UNIVAC later released a commercial version, the UNIVAC 490. That system was later upgraded to a multiprocessor configuration as the 494.

==Overview==
The machine was the size and shape of a refrigerator, about four feet high (roughly 1.20 meters), with a hinged lid for access. Shortly after completing the prototype design, Cray left to join Control Data Corporation. When the Navy awarded Sperry Rand a US$50 million contract to build the AN/USQ-17, Univac engineers redesigned the entire machine from scratch using silicon transistors. They retained the instruction set, so that programs developed for the original machine would still run on the new one.

As part of the redesign it was decided to improve access, and the second version was designed to stand upright, like an old fashioned double-door refrigerator, about six feet tall (roughly 1.80 m). This new design was designated the AN/USQ-20.

Instructions were represented as 30-bit words, in the following format:
 f 6 bits function code 
 j 3 bits jump condition designator 
 k 3 bits partial word designator 
 b 3 bits which index register to use 
 y 15 bits operand address in memory

Numbers were represented as 30-bit words, this allowed for five 6-bit alphanumeric characters per word.

The main memory was 32,768 = 32K words of core memory.

The available processor registers were:
*One 30-bit accumulator (A).
*One 30-bit Q register (combined with A to give a total of 60 bits for the result of multiplication or the dividend in division).
*Seven 15-bit index registers (B1–B7).

The instruction format defined for the AN/USQ-17 marked the beginning of an instruction set which would be carried on, with many changes along the way, into later UNIVAC computers including the UNIVAC 1100/2200 series, which is still in use .

<text>Althorp ( ) is a Grade I listed stately home and estate in the civil parish of Althorp, in West Northamptonshire, England of about . By road it is about northwest of the county town of Northampton and about northwest of central London, situated between the villages of Great Brington and Harlestone. It has been held by the Spencer family for more than 500 years, and has been owned by Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer since 1992. It was also the home of Lady Diana Spencer (later Princess of Wales) from her parents&#x27; divorce until her marriage to Charles, Prince of Wales (later King Charles III).

Althorp is mentioned as a small hamlet in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Olletorp&quot;, and by 1377 it had become a village with a population of more than fifty people. By 1505 there were no longer any tenants living there, and in 1508, John Spencer purchased Althorp estate with the funds generated from his family&#x27;s sheep-rearing business. Althorp became one of the prominent stately homes in England. The house dates to 1688, replacing an earlier house that was once visited by Charles I. The Spencer family amassed an extensive art collection and other valuable household items. During the 18th century, the house became a major cultural hub in England, and parties were regularly held, attracting many prominent members of Great Britain&#x27;s ruling class. George John, 2nd Earl Spencer, who owned Althorp between 1783 and his death in 1834, developed one of the largest private libraries in Europe at the palace, which grew to over 100,000 books by the 1830s. After falling on hard times, John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer, known as the Red Earl, in 1892 sold much of the collection to Enriqueta Rylands, who was building the University of Manchester Library. Many of Althorp&#x27;s furnishings were sold off during the twentieth century, and between 1975 and 1992 alone approximately 20% of the contents were auctioned.

The house at Althorp was a &quot;classically beautiful&quot; red brick Tudor building, but its appearance was radically altered, starting in 1788, when the architect Henry Holland was commissioned to make extensive changes. Mathematical tiles were added to the exterior, encasing the brick, and four Corinthian pilasters were added to the front. The grand hall entrance to the house, Wootton Hall, was cited by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as &quot;the noblest Georgian room in the county&quot;. The great dining room in the east wing extension of the house was added in 1877 to designs by John Macvicar Anderson, its walls hung with faded, red damask silk. Numerous fireplaces and furnishings were brought to Althorp from Spencer House in London during the Blitz for safekeeping and still remain. The Picture Gallery stretches for on the first floor of the west wing, and is one of the best remaining examples of the original Tudor oak woodwork and ambiance in the mansion. It has an extensive collection of portraits, including Anthony van Dyck&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;, a John de Critz portrait of James I, a Mary Beale portrait of Charles II, and many others. Some £2 million was spent on redecorating the palace in the 1980s, during which time most of the religious paintings of Althorp were sold off.

In total, the grounds of Althorp estate contain 28 listed buildings and structures, including nine planting stones. The former falconry, now a Grade I listed building, was built in 1613. Gardener&#x27;s House is listed as a Grade II* listed building in its own right, as are the Grade II listed West and East Lodges. The mustard-yellow Grade II* listed stable block, designed by architect Roger Morris with a Palladian influence, was ordered by Charles, 5th Earl of Sunderland in the early 1730s. The French landscape architect André Le Nôtre was commissioned to lay out the park and grounds in the 1660s, and further alterations were made during the late 18th century under Henry Holland. Following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, she was interred on a small island in the middle of the ornamental Round Oval lake. A Doric-style temple with Diana&#x27;s name inscribed on top, situated across from the lake, is a tourist attraction during July and August when the house and estate are open to the public, although the exhibition centre, situated in the old stable block, closed permanently in 2013.

==Etymology==

A manor existed at Althorp in medieval times. It was referred to in the Domesday Book as &quot;Olletorp&quot;, meaning Olla&#x27;s Thorp, believed to refer to a medieval lord named Olla. Thorp is a word of Scandinavian origin, which would have been pronounced as &quot;throop&quot; or &quot;thrupp&quot;, and in Danish probably meant &quot;daughter&#x27;s settlement&quot;. In the 13th and 15th centuries it was recorded as &quot;Holtropp&quot; and &quot;Aldrop&quot;, although when the estate was bought by John Spencer in 1508 it began to be referred to as &quot;Oldthorpe&quot;.

The name today is properly pronounced as &quot;Awltrupp&quot;, which is not officially recognised on paper and by the media. The current owner, Charles Spencer, noted that none of his family refer to it as Althorp, and that his father insisted on pronouncing it &quot;Awl-trupp&quot;. When he assumed ownership in 1992, the BBC Pronunciation Department contacted him and the current &quot;Awl-thorp&quot; was agreed upon.

==History==

===Early history===
A hamlet named Althorp existed here in medieval times, believed to have been situated on the southwest side of the park, east of West Lodge. It was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as having a population of ten at the time, and being part of the parish of Brington. It was officially designated as an &quot;extra parochial district&quot; for centuries under the New Bottle Grove Hundred of Brington, but by 1874 it was being cited as an independent civil parish. 21 residents were documented in 1327, and in 1377 fifty people were reported to have paid Poll Tax over the age of 14. During the 15th century the population of the village diminished, and in 1505 there were no longer any tenants living there. By 1577 most of the land was converted into four substantial sheep pastures.

In 1469 John Spencer&#x27;s uncle – also named John Spencer – had become feoffee (feudal lord) of Wormleighton in Warwickshire and a tenant at Althorp in Northamptonshire in 1486. The family&#x27;s administration of their Northamptonshire and Warwickshire estates gained them admiration and a following throughout England, and their sheep-rearing business earned large profits. After beginning construction of Wormleighton Manor the previous year with some 60 relatives, John Spencer bought Althorp in 1508 for £800 from the Catesby family. At the time Spencer was also lord of the manors of Fenny Compton, Stoneton, Nobottle, Great Brington, Little Brington, Harlestone, Glassthorpe, Flore, Wicken, Wyke Hamon, Upper Boddington, Lower Boddington and Hinton, and owned numerous other properties. The park took some four years to establish, with 300 acres of grassland, 100 acres of woodland and 40 acres of water.

When John Spencer died in 1522, he passed the estate to his youngest son, Sir William Spencer, High Sheriff of Northamptonshire, who held it until his death in 1532. Only a boy at the time of William&#x27;s death, his son John Spencer inherited Althorp and held it until his death in 1586, when he passed it to his son, also John, who died in 1600. John&#x27;s son, Robert, was created the 1st Baron Spencer of Wormleighton on 21 July 1603. Anne of Denmark and Prince Henry came to Althorp on 25 June 1603 from Dingley Hall on their way to Windsor from Edinburgh. She was welcomed by an entertainment scripted by Ben Jonson in which the Fairy Queen Mab gave her a jewel. Lady Anne Clifford described the &quot;infinite number of lords of ladies&quot; who came to see the new queen on Sunday. On Monday, she moved on to Easton Neston.

King Charles I is documented to have visited Althorp during his reign. The drawing room was built and the main hall enlarged for the occasion, with £1,300 spent on the banquet, an exorbitant sum for the period. Upon Robert Spencer&#x27;s death in 1627 Althorp devolved to William Spencer, 2nd Baron Spencer of Wormleighton who held it until his death in 1636. William&#x27;s eldest son, Henry Spencer, 1st Earl of Sunderland, known as The Lord Spencer between 1636 and June 1643, fought in the Battle of Edgehill in 1642 and was rewarded for his services on 8 June 1643 when the title of Earl of Sunderland was bestowed upon him, although the title cost him £3,000. He then fought in the siege of Gloucester in August 1643 and the First Battle of Newbury on 20 September 1643, where he was killed, aged 23, by a cannonball.

Following Henry&#x27;s death, the estate passed to his eldest son Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland, just two years of age at the time. Cosimo III visited Althorp in 1669, documenting it in his &quot;Travels of Cosmo III. Grand Duke of Tuscany, through England, in 1669&quot;. Robert built the current house in 1688 and made a series of changes to Althorp park. However, Robert&#x27;s bad temper and his reputation as a ruthless advocate of absolute monarchy made him numerous enemies, and he was forced to leave the country and flee to the Netherlands the same year. He later underwent a political rehabilitation, becoming Lord Chamberlain of the Household in April 1697 and Lord Justice for a short period before retiring from public life in December of that year, after which he lived a secluded life at Althorp until his death in 1702. Robert passed Althorp to his son, Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland, who held it for twenty years. Described by John Evelyn as &quot;a youth of extraordinary hopes,&quot; Charles inherited his father&#x27;s passion for intrigue and repellent manners, and from his early years he had a great love of books, spending his leisure and his wealth in expanding the library at Althorp. Charles&#x27;s second marriage to Anne Churchill, daughter of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough in 1700 was an important alliance for the Spencers and for his descendants; through it he was introduced to political life, and later the dukedom of Marlborough came to the Spencers. In 1722 he was implicated in what became known as the Atterbury Plot, to restore the House of Stuart, and his death was one of the factors which brought the Plot to light. Althorp was then occupied by his son Robert Spencer, 4th Earl of Sunderland, who died childless in 1729. As a result, his brother, Charles, became 5th Earl of Sunderland, and subsequently 3rd Duke of Marlborough after the death of his aunt, Henrietta Godolphin (&quot;née&quot; Churchill), 2nd Duchess of Marlborough. Charles later led the naval descent on the French coastal port of St Malo during the Seven Years&#x27; War, after passing Althorp to the 3rd Earl&#x27;s son, John Spencer, in January 1733. John Spencer, along with Charles and Thomas Coram, William Hogarth and others, was involved in the charter of the Foundling Hospital. Upon his death in 1746, John passed his estates to his son John, only 12 years of age at the time, beneficiary to the greatest inheritance in the kingdom at the time with an income of almost £30,000 a year.

===Social and cultural hub===

John served as Member of Parliament for Warwick from 1756 to 1761. He was renowned for his heavy spending on his political pursuits and campaigns, &quot;indulging in the fiercely competitive and heinously expensive business of fighting elections to Parliament – which effectively meant bribing people to vote for his candidate rather than that of another magnate&quot;. He spent £120,000 in one campaign alone and spent heavily on his estates, building Spencer House in London. He also wore expensive fashionable attire such as &quot;diamond-buckled shoes&quot;. Althorp frequently hosted parties attended by the political and cultural elite, and it became known as a place of indulgence and festivities. At dinners and picnics in the gardens, John hired musicians to play French horns and organised unusual spectacles to entertain guests, such as a &quot;Hooray Henry Olympics&quot;, as Charles Spencer calls it, with a donkey race for Lord Fordwick, dance competitions offering a guinea as the first prize, and sack races with the first prize of 30 shillings. The Christmas of 1755 was a grand affair. John celebrated his 21st birthday with a ball at the house on 20 December during which he secretly married 18-year-old Margaret Georgiana Poyntz; the couple did not inform anyone for several days. Around 5,000 guests were invited to a celebration party organised by the Spencers in a shed on the village green in the nearby village of Brington, consuming some 11,000 pints of beer. Althorp was &quot;buzzing with activity&quot;, and France&#x27;s top chefs were brought to Althorp to cater for the family and their guests during the week. He was created Baron Spencer of Althorp and Viscount Spencer by George III on 3 April 1761, and on 1 November 1765, he was given the title Viscount Althorp and made the first Earl Spencer. He was also High Steward of St Albans in 1772 and Mayor of St Albans in 1779. John&#x27;s daughter, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, was also known for her liberal spending, and although she became one of Britain&#x27;s most prominent socialites in the late 18th century, with many political and literary connections, she suffered from a gambling addiction and had an eating disorder.
John&#x27;s son George John, 2nd Earl Spencer inherited Althorp after his father&#x27;s death in 1783. He served as Whig MP for Northampton from 1780 to 1782 and for Surrey from 1782 to 1783 before accepting the title of 2nd Earl Spencer. He was later Home Secretary from 1806 to 1807 under Lord Grenville in the Ministry of All the Talents. Extremely interested in literary pursuits, he developed one of the largest private libraries in Europe at Althorp. He was the instigator and first President of the Roxburghe Club (an exclusive bibliophilic club), founded in 1812, President of the Royal Institution from 1813 to 1827, and Commissioner of the Public Records in 1831, among other literary pursuits. In later life, his collecting habit had become an obsession, and he attempted to collect every volume ever published in Britain. Such was his desire to obtain as complete a collection as possible, that when Napoleon instigated the secularisation of religious houses in south Germany, Spencer used the local British agent and Benedictine monk, Alexander Horn to acquire many of their rare books and manuscripts. Althorp became a major cultural hub of England during his time; at one Christmas, the actor David Garrick, the historian Edward Gibbon, the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan and the painter Joshua Reynolds, among other artistic figures attended a party there together. However, George John&#x27;s spending became problematic for the Spencers, especially as at the time they were feeling the impact of the agricultural depressions brought on by the Napoleonic Wars. By the time of his death in 1834 he had amassed a debt of £500,000, which he passed onto his son, John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer.

The 3rd Earl became an active statesman, serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne from 1830 to 1834. Along with Lord John Russell, he led the fight to pass the Reform Bill of 1832, making more than twenty speeches, and is generally considered the architect of its victory. Despite his debts, in respect for his father, John managed to retain the massive book collection, and also continue to run the other Spencer houses at Wimbledon and Spencer House in London, as well as his farm in Wiseton and shooting retreat in Norfolk. He achieved this mainly by far less extravagant living, spending much of the year at Wiseton where the running costs were £1,200 compared with the £5,000 needed to run Althorp and pay the staff of 40 in the house. As a result, Althorp was largely abandoned during the late 1830s and early 1840s. John also leased out his lands and gardens and sold land in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, repaying all the debt by the time of his death in 1845, and beginning to run his properties at a profit. His son Frederick Spencer, 4th Earl Spencer, who owned Althorp from 1845 until his death in 1857, also retained the collection.

John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer, known as the Red Earl, inherited Althorp in 1857. He served as a Liberal Party politician and was a close friend of British prime minister William Gladstone, who he served under in all four of his cabinets. Although politically successful, John fell into hard times financially and was forced to eventually sell much of the enormous library collection in 1892 to Enriqueta Rylands, who was building the University of Manchester Library. After dying childless in 1910, John passed Althorp to his half brother, Charles Spencer, 6th Earl Spencer, who served as Lord Chamberlain from 1905 to 1912 in the Liberal administrations headed by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith.

===Modern history===

Times became more difficult for the Spencers by the late 19th century, and many of their assets had to be sold off. Albert Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer inherited the estate after his father Charles&#x27; death in 1922. Albert became a well-known art connoisseur and was a trustee of the Wallace Collection, chairman of the Royal School of Needlework, a Fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries of London and the Royal Society of Arts, and from 1961 until 1969 he was Chair of the Advisory Council of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Despite his keen interest in art, he began selling off paintings and other items to pay off debts. In the 1930s he was forced to sell off a small but immaculate Hans Holbein portrait of Henry VIII (now at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid) for £10,000 to finance his son&#x27;s education. Although a large sum at the time, by 1998 it was reputed to be worth around £50 million. Unlike many country houses in Britain during the Second World War which were occupied by the military and converted into hospitals, training camps and barracks, Althorp Palace remained untouched, thanks to Albert who saw to it that they used the stables instead. A Wellington bomber crashed near the ice house during the war, killing all of its crew. Due to Spencer House being in a dangerous location in London during the Blitz, many of the pieces of furniture and items of the house were brought to Althorp for safekeeping, including numerous fireplaces and doors with curled &quot;S&quot; doorknobs, a signature of the Spencer family dating to the 18th century.

The estate was first opened to the public in 1953 by Albert, to mitigate against taxation, and Althorp had its own railway station called Althorp Park on the Northampton Loop Line until 1960. After his death in 1975, Albert passed Althorp to his son Edward John, 8th Earl Spencer, who had served as Equerry to King George VI (1950–52) and to Queen Elizabeth II (1952–54). Edward was a wine connoisseur and had an extensive wine cellar at Althorp. He made his own wine and attracted fellow connoisseurs from around the world to Althorp, although he did not sell much of it. During Edward&#x27;s ownership of Althorp approximately 20% of the furnishings of Althorp were sold off. The divestment included eleven Van Dykes and nearly every religious painting in the collection, as well as estate housing, and drew severe public criticism, including from the heir.

Edward left the estate to his son, the current owner Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, after his death in 1992. As a teenager, Charles served as a tour guide at the house and acquired a deep knowledge of Althorp. At the time he inherited the estate it was losing some £400,000 annually, and the staff of 14 had to be significantly reduced. Charles&#x27; older sister was Diana, Princess of Wales, who grew up with him at Althorp.
Since the 1990s Charles Spencer has done much to increase the revenue earned by the estate to keep it running. The annual Althorp Literary Festival was founded in 2003. The heir apparent is Charles&#x27; son Louis Frederick John Spencer (born 1994). Charles has expressed concerns about the future of the estate and whether Louis might be forced to sell it. In 2005 Charles endorsed a furniture collection of replicas from the house, known as the Althorp Living History Collection.

In 2009 a major restoration of the roof, stonework and the mathematical tiles that clad the building was undertaken. Approximately £10 million was spent on repairing the roof alone. In 2010 an auction of over 700 items from Althorp&#x27;s attics and cellars, as well as a Rubens and other notable works, achieved £21 million.

==Architecture and collections==

Althorp house is described as standing in a low situation, &quot;approached by a handsome avenue, beautifully shaded with trees&quot;. The house was originally a &quot;classically beautiful&quot; red brick Tudor building, and a Johannes Vorstermans painting dated to 1677 shows a smaller red house at Althorp and Holdenby House in the distance to the far right. Cosmo III noted that the interior of Althorp house was strongly influenced by Italian architecture, and remarked that it &quot;may be said to be the best planned, and best arranged country seat in the kingdom; for though there may be many which surpass it in size, none are superior to it in symmetrical elegance&quot;. The current building dates to 1688. Diarist John Evelyn described it that year: &quot;The house, or rather palace, at Althorpe is a noble uniform pile in form of a half H, built of brick and freestone &#x27;a la moderne&#x27;; the hall is well, the staircase excellent; the rooms of state, galleries, offices, and furniture, such as may become a great prince. It is situate in the midst of a garden, exquisitely planned and kept and all this in a park walled in with hewn stone, planted with rows and walks of trees, canals and fishponds and stored with game.&quot; Its appearance was radically altered in the 18th century when the architect Henry Holland was commissioned to make extensive changes starting in 1788. Mathematical tiles were added to the exterior, brought from Ipswich, encasing the old red brick, and four Corinthian pilasters, made from Roche Abbey stone in Yorkshire, were added to the front. The stone used to make the pilasters was reportedly intended by Christopher Wren to be used in the construction of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Sash windows with glazing bars and &quot;moulded stone
heads and surrounds&quot; were added.

===Interior===
The interior of the palace is generally considered its strongest asset as the Spencer family has assembled an impressive collection of portrait art, including several pieces painted by the Flemish master Anthony van Dyck including War and Peace, the favourite of the 9th Earl Spencer, as well as countless valuable pieces of porcelain and furniture. One of the rooms in the estate is called the Queen Mary bedroom, which was used by Queen Mary and George V during their visit to the estate in 1913. Some £2 million was spent on redecorating the house in the 1980s by Raine, Countess Spencer. This work has been reversed, and the interior returned to its original grand but understated appearance.

====Ground floor====

=====Wootton Hall and saloon=====
Wootton Hall is the grand hall entrance on the central south side of Althorp house. &quot;Perfectly proportioned&quot; with a two-storey high ceiling, it was cited by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as &quot;the noblest Georgian room in the county&quot;. It takes its name from the painter John Wootton who was commissioned by the family in 1733 to paint a number of massive paintings in his Marylebone studio to reflect the family&#x27;s love of equestrian pursuits, particularly fox hunting. At the time, Wootton was considered to be the finest painter of horses in the country. The paintings still hang on the walls. The hall has a substantial collection of artefacts collected over the years. Aside from the hall porter&#x27;s chair, there is a dozen or so lavish-looking hall chairs, one of which is a sedan chair, rediscovered in the stable block in 1911, which had once been in Spencer House.

A prominent feature of the Wootton Hall is its pair of Italian black and Beschia marble blackamoor torchères, originally given to the First Duke of Marlborough as a present from General Charles Churchill. In exceptionally good condition, they stand either side of the door into the saloon. These were discovered in the silt of the River Tiber and are depictions of slaves who once served in a Roman household. Several flags stand above them, including the White Ensign. The ceiling is intricately made, featuring flowers in the plaster, each one different, the work of Colen Campbell in the early 18th century. The black and white check marble floor is also a distinguishing feature of the room, but through most of its history this floor would have been left plain as horses and carriages would enter the hall inside. In the mid-19th century Frederick, the 4th Earl, had laid down brown and blue tiles, replaced by the marble floor which was added by his son Robert in around 1910. The floor gives significant depth to the hall and provides fine acoustics, so much that Diana would once practice her tap dancing in the hall as a teenager.

Beyond the Wootton Hall is the saloon, which was converted from an inner courtyard and roofed in 1650 by Dorothy Spencer, Countess of Sunderland. The saloon was the first room at Althorp to have electricity installed, and it contains an imposing oak staircase, added in the 1660s. Cosmo III noted Althorp&#x27;s &quot;spacious staircase of the wood of the walnut tree, stained, constructed with great magnificence; this staircase, dividing itself into two equal branches, leads to the grand saloon, from which is the passage into the chambers, all of them regularly disposed after the Italian manner, to which country the Earl was indented for a model of the design.&quot; Historically, the staircase was painted white. It is described as being &quot;surprisingly shallow and delightfully uneven – a physical manifestation of the long history of the house&quot;.

=====Sitting and drawing rooms=====
The south drawing room is at the front of the house on the West Wing. In earlier times the room had served as a dining room, despite it being about as far from the kitchen as possible. This section of the house was largely remodelled under Henry Holland, but it retains its Georgian elegance today, &quot;gilded to within an inch of its life&quot;, with walls painted in a duck egg blue colour with forest green drapery and peach-patterned sofas. A large mirror with an exquisite gold frame stands between the two windows. The fireplace was added by the Chelsea stonemason Lancelot Edward Wood in 1802, and the ceiling by master builder Benjamin Broadbent of Leicester in 1865. The ceiling in the yellow drawing room, also known as the Rubens room because of its four Rubens paintings, is also attributed to Broadbent. There are numerous paintings on the walls, including fifteen Joshua Reynolds portraits and a miniature portrait in one of the alcoves of Admiral Lord Nelson, an associate of George John, Second Earl Spencer. Although Higgerson, the night watchman, guarded the place from 8 pm to 8 am, in 1954 one of the lesser valuable paintings in the south drawing room was stolen in the night.

The grandmother&#x27;s sitting room is situated at the front of the eastern wing. It is noted for its deep blue hand-painted frescoes and formal furniture, and was the favourite room of Charles and Diana&#x27;s grandmother, Cynthia Spencer, Countess Spencer. Nearby was the Muniment room in which the Spencer family records were kept, described as a &quot;musty apartment&quot; which contained over 500 years of history, from medieval household accounts to letters from Jacobeans and accounts of Victorian house parties. The room was a favourite haunt of Spencer&#x27;s grandfather, Albert Spencer, who would spend thousands of hours in it perusing over the family history. So guarded was he of the collection that when Winston Churchill once spent time in the room looking for information on his ancestor, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650–1722), Albert immediately doused out his cigar in fear of creating a fire. The records were sold to the British Library in the 1980s, leaving the room empty, before it was converted to what is known as the &quot;Steward&#x27;s Room Flat&quot;. This part of the house once had an extensive collection of 1830s bull paintings by Richard Ansdell.

The Sutherland room lies at the rear east wing of the house and was once the bedroom of the Earl of Althorp in the first few centuries of the house when it was fashionable for the occupants to sleep on the ground floor and guests to sleep on the first floor. This was still the case during the Holland restoration, and as a result the room was ignored, so it retains many of the earlier mouldings not seen in many other parts of the house. It contains two fireplaces made by John Vardy and James Stuart which were originally situated in Spencer House, and the room has the original 17th-century cornice. The paintings in the room were selected by the current owner Charles Spencer to honour John, Third Earl Spencer and his passion for foxhunting. After it ceased usage as a bedroom, on special occasions the room would be full of life; on Christmas Day the room would be &quot;transformed into a Christmas fairyland, with clockwork Santas, snowmen and angels all spinning and chiming in the candlelight&quot;. The children would have their places marked by a small cake with their names written on it in icing.

The Marlborough room, which contains the great parlour, is named after Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, and is situated next to the Sunderland room and at left angles to the library. The Marlborough room served as an &quot;uncomfortable&quot; drawing room until the 1990s when a Victorian rosewood dining table accommodating for up to 42 people was added, with &#x27;squiggle-back&#x27; chairs attributed to George Seddon in 1800. The new room was created after alterations were made to the large drawing room by the 6th Earl Spencer in 1911, including the removal of a dividing partition from the old billiard room. Part of the restoration work attributed to the 7th Earl Spencer after 1957 includes a replacement of two Victorian chimney pieces in the Marlborough room with those from Spencer House, one which was crafted by Peter Scheemakers. Portraits by Thomas Gainsborough, Joshua Reynolds, and George Romney, mostly of family members, adorn the walls, and accessions from the Spencer House are placed throughout.
Examples of paintings at Althorp

=====Dining rooms=====
The great dining room is situated in the east wing extension of the house and was added in 1877 under J. MacVicar Anderson during the time of the Red Earl. The room was inspired by the ballroom of Buckingham Palace, with walls hung with faded, red damask silk. The Spencers ate their regular meals in the tapestry dining room, an inner room of the east side to the east of the Wooton Hall. Aside from the two fine vividly constructed tapestries, one of gypsies and one of farming, the room is fairly bleak in design compared to other rooms in the house; the dining table is relatively small, with a drab grey floor and open brick fireplace dated in large letters to 1683. The &quot;sombre&quot; oak panelling originally came from the family&#x27;s other property of Wormleighton Manor in Warwickshire. Charles Spencer recalled that three generations of Spencers would eat their lunch together and that dining conditions were &quot;silent, apart from the noises of my grandfather eating with great gusto, a napkin tucked in around his neck, hanging down over his popping-out tummy, and it was all very sad and tense&quot;.

=====Library=====
The ceiling of the original library at Althorp collapsed in 1773, and at the same time a new floor was put down in the Picture Gallery. Ionic columns and an Adam style ceiling were added. George John&#x27;s fascination in literature began at a young age and there is a Reynolds portrait in the house of him at Trinity College, Cambridge holding a book By his later life, George John&#x27;s collecting habit had become something of an obsession and he attempted to collect every volume ever published in Britain. 

The books were kept in five apartments in Althorp in the west wing, which, combined, formed the &quot;Long Library&quot; with books from the floor to the ceiling along much of its approximately length. He not only collected British works but imported Greek and Latin classics, and in 1790, he acquired the collection of Count Charles de Revicksky, paying an initial £1000, and then £500 annually until the count&#x27;s death, only three years later. George often paid great fees for rare books, including a woodcut of St Christopher dated to 1423, believed at that time to be the oldest work in ink with a date on it, the Papal Indulgence Letters of 1452, the Mazarin Bible of 1455, the Mentz Psalter of 1457, and some of the earliest works form the printing presses of Augsburg and Nuremberg such as &quot;Bonaventurae&quot; and &quot;Comestiorum Vitiorum&quot;. In 1812, George John was involved in an intense bidding war with his cousin, The Duke of Marlborough, for a copy of Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;The Decameron&quot; of 1471, one of only three known copies. Marlborough won the auction with a bid of £2,260 – an amount described by Charles Spencer as &quot;ludicrous&quot; for that time – but he later sold it to George for £750.

In 1802, George hired Reverend Thomas Frognall Dibdin as an official librarian to look after the collection and the library contains his many catalogues entitled &quot;Aedes Althorpianæ&quot;, documenting the books of the library. The collection became so enormous that the massive library became inadequate to hold the contents, and books began being stored along the long picture gallery on the first floor above it. By the time of George John&#x27;s death in 1834, he had amassed one of the largest private collections in Europe of some 110,000 volumes. Alcoves were added to the ends of the library during the Holland restoration, creating extra room for the growing collection.

=====Billiard room=====
The billiard room is situated between the south drawing room and the library, and overlooks the deer park. Once known as the &quot;Rubens room&quot;, the room was once described by Charles Spencer as a &quot;dead space; desperately uncomfortable furniture, and Rubens&#x27;s imposing portraits of several unattractive Habsburgs, against a tightly patterned silver silk, making it anything but welcoming&quot;. The room has now been &quot;brought to life&quot; with numerous horse and sporting paintings and portraits, including a dramatic portrait of Elisabeth, Empress of Austria hunting, and a full-sized billiard table moved from the stables in the 1990s. The chimney piece of the room was made by Derval under Holland, and the room also contains an 1893 bronze sculpture of Forager, the Red Earl&#x27;s favourite foxhound. The Broadbent ceiling is dated to 1865.

=====China museum and porcelain=====
The old &quot;painter&#x27;s passage&quot;, parallel to the south drawing room, was renovated after the Second World War when glass cases were installed along its length to showcase the Spencer crockery, with a range of porcelain including Meissen, Sèvres, Kangxi, Chelsea and Derby pieces. Charles Spencer remarked that his grandfather Albert was trying to say, &quot;This part of Althorp will never be lived in again; so we may as well use it to show off the treasures in an orderly way&quot;. Today, most of the collection has been moved to the China Museum which lies on the east side of the house, between the Sutherland room and the great dining room, and the passage now contains a series of busts and paintings in its place, including a self-portrait of Sofonisba Anguisciola, and portraits of the dramatist Molière and the actor David Garrick. Charles Spencer highlights a pair of late 17th-century blue and white tulipieres, special vases to hold tulips which were fashionable at the time, as his favourite in the museum.

The Garden Lobby of Althorp also contains a number of pieces of porcelain from reputable European manufacturers, but also several rare Oriental pieces. Of note in the Garden Lobby aside from its many plates is a Sèvres tobacco jar with double strap handles, believed to be painted by Louis Jean Thévenet in 1765, two Chelsea vases decorated with putti which metaphorically represent the four seasons, which the Red Earl had bought as a gift for his wife Charlotte, an extremely finely carved Meissen flower bowl with hundreds of tiny gilded blooms which dates to around 1745, a Meissen card box, and a blue and gold cherubic Meissen chocolate set-for-one which was believed to have been made for Marie Antoinette in 1781 as a present celebrating the birth of her son Dauphin.

=====The picture gallery and chapel=====
The picture gallery stretches for on the first floor of the west wing, wide and high. The room is one of the best remaining examples of the original Tudor woodwork and ambiance in the mansion, featuring oak panelling along its length. During the renovation of the 18th century, the oak panelling in the gallery was covered with white paint, and it was not until 1904 that it was restored to its former glory, the restoration funded by the sale of a Rubens painting in the housekeeper&#x27;s room. Due to its length, during Tudor times the ladies of the mansion used the gallery for exercise on rainy days to avoid dragging their long skirts and dresses through the mud in the grounds. It was also used as a dining hall, and in 1695 the county nobility and gentry all met together and dined in the gallery to pay their respects to William III.

The gallery has an extensive collection of about 60 portraits, including Van Dyck&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;, a John de Critz portrait of James I, a Frans Pourbus the Younger aristocratic portrait of Claude Lorraine, Duc de Chevreuse, a Mary Beale portrait of Charles II and others of him by court artist Sir Peter Lely, and portraits of George Digby, Second Earl of Bristol and William, First Duke of Bedford. Visiting the gallery in 1748, the Marchioness Grey described the gallery in a letter to a friend: &quot;Indeed there is a gracefulness and life in the figures beyond what I ever saw, they are quite animated and a strength of colouring that strikes you from one end of that gallery to the other. It is so beautiful that a picture which hangs by it is hurt by its situation.&quot; Horace Walpole once wrote: &quot;Althorp has several very fine pictures by the best Italian hands, and a gallery of all one&#x27;s acquaintances by Vandyke and Lely. In the gallery I found myself quite at home; and surprised the housekeeper by my familiarity with the portraits.&quot; The portraits in the Picture Gallery are set in extravagant baroque gilded frames, designed by Robert Spencer, the Second Earl, which feature as &quot;cartouche at the top and a stylised mask at the bottom, with a moulded inner edge, which softens the line between frame and painting&quot;. Albert Spencer was so protective of &quot;War and Peace&quot;, once the most valuable item in Althorp, that he had the nearest tall window in the gallery converted into a door with hinges, so in case of a fire it could safely be lifted outside. There is also a small hidden door between &quot;War and Peace&quot; and &quot;The Windsor Beauties&quot; cut into the oak which leads to a staircase and the Pink Suite, a guest bedroom. Lady Margaret Douglas-Home, sister of Albert Spencer, lived at Althorp from 1910, and the gallery was a favourite of hers. During the renovation of the 1980s, the old-fashioned celestial and terrestrial globes dating to the George II period were moved from the gallery back to the library.

The chapel on the upper floor became a store room in the early 1980s for pieces being sold off. The stained glass window of the chapel, with the Spencer crest, dates to 1588, and was brought to Althorp from Wormleigton. The organ on the other hand is far more recent, acquired from the parish of Meriden in the 1990s. A number of earlier occupants of Althorp, particularly George John and Frederick, were devout Christians and would preach in the chapel, and Robert, 6th Earl Spencer would hold a daily service here. It is still used for family christenings, and for services at Christmas, Easter and Harvest Thanksgiving.

=====Bedrooms=====
The oak bedroom is at the rear of the castle, on the western side between King William bedroom and the great room. The marriage of the first Earl Spencer and Margaret Georgiana took place in secret here on 20 December 1755, during a ball which was taking place at Althorp to celebrate John&#x27;s 21st birthday. Georgiana later recalled, &quot;We both behaved very well, spoke distinctly and loudly but I trembled so much I could hardly stand&quot;. As of 1998 it was furnished with deep red wall paper, rug and chairs, with oak floors, bed and chairs. There are several portraits on the wall, one of them very large above the fireplace. The Spencer &quot;S&quot; features on the blue velvet bed cover, and above the king-sized bed and by the fireplace.

The room to the east of the oak bedroom is known as the great room. The room was established in the mid-17th century as part of a reception suite, and was used by George John, the Second Earl for important political conferences during his period as First Lord of the Admiralty and Home Secretary. The great room, predominantly red and gold in design like many of the first floor rooms, contains a table and chairs with a large gilded mirror with three urns in front of it. The long mirror, designed by James Stuart, who was noted for his Athenian designs, features a tableaux at the top with the Spencer coat of arms and the pulling of chariots by cherubs, representing the love between John and Georgiana. The great room contains an extensive collection of miniature portraits, including a very rare Lucas de Heere portrait of Lady Jane Grey as a teenage girl at her family residence in Bradgate, Leicestershire. The &quot;Portrait of Isaak Abrahamsz. Massa&quot; is mentioned in the 1822 &quot;Bibliotheca Spenceriana&quot; as hanging in one of the bedrooms at Althorp. It was sold in 1924 to art merchant Joseph Duveen, who sold it the following year to Canadian businessman Frank P. Wood.

The Princess of Wales Bedroom is named after the wife of the future King Edward VII, Alexandra, Princess of Wales, who stayed at Althorp in 1863 on a visit to see the Red Earl. Although the fabric of the four-poster bed was designed in 1911, the room is largely Georgian, with deep red walls and furnishings, and contains a notable portrait of a young princess by the Spanish court painter, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. The Queen Mary Bedroom is named after Mary, the wife of King George V, who visited Althorp in 1913. It contains a bed with an extremely tall structure, dated to the 18th century, draped in pea green taffet. Of particular note in the Queen Mary Bedroom are two chairs covered with needlework created by Albert, who was once the chairman of the Royal School of Needlework.

The upper floor also contains the India silk bedroom and the ante room, which measures 23 ft 4 inches by 32 ft 6 inches. Formerly known as the patchwork bedroom, the ante room was established by Charlotte, Countess Spencer and her sister during the Victorian period, and today forms part of a suite of state chambers.

===Outer buildings===
In total, Althorp estate contains 28 listed buildings and structures, of which nine are planting stones, dotted around the park. Two are Grade I listed, including the main house; two are Grade II* listed, including the stable block and Gardener&#x27;s House, Althorp, and the remainder have a Grade II designation, mainly garden screens, gates and gateways aside from the planting stones.

The mustard-yellow Grade II* listed stable block, designed by architect Roger Morris with a Palladian influence, was ordered by Charles, Fifth Earl of Sutherland in the early 1730s. It replaced an earlier building which had long been in disrepair and could hold 30 to 40 horses. Morris designed the building with a clear Tuscan architectural design, drawing upon earlier inspiration from his stables at Inigo Jones&#x27;s St Paul&#x27;s Church in Covent Garden. A fountain was installed in the courtyard to provide the horse&#x27;s troughs with water, although this no longer survives. Several rooms were built within the stable block, including hot and cold baths for riders after hunting, a veterinarian&#x27;s room with medicines for horses, and what was once a smoking room. Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough remarked at how large the structure was when it was constructed, noting that it was rather an extravagance. It was converted into an exhibition centre to celebrate the life of Princess Diana between 1998 and 2013, and the space now houses a yearly exhibition picking on a theme of the estate. 2019&#x27;s was entitled &#x27;Animals of Althorp&#x27; and explored the estate&#x27;s relationship with animals throughout the centuries. .

The Grade I listed Falconry was built in 1613 using the same local ironstone as the stables and is of similar Palladian appearance, featuring a &quot;gabled roof with ashlar parapets, kneelers and obelisks&quot;. It is a two-storey structure, but a single storey red-brick extension was added in the 19th century. The hall of the falconry contains 2 arcaded openings with keystones, and to the left of the hall is a fireplace with Delft tiles, dated to the 19th century. Over the centuries at various times it has been the home of the park warden, the gamekeeper, and the kennelman who looked after the hounds, hosting puppy shows in the 20th century. Both the stable block and Falconry became listed buildings in November 1954. Nearby was the Lavender Cottage with a thatched roof and a wendy house which the Althorp children would play in, but was accidentally burned down by the son of the chauffeur of Albert, and never rebuilt.

The Fifth Earl also built the Grade II* listed Gardener&#x27;s House at the back of the park, in a similar Palladian style. The head gardener of Althorp resided at the villa in the 18th century. Princess Diana had been intent on living in the castle following her separation from Prince Charles, but due to security concerns it was considered unfeasible. Of particular note is its Victorian three-quarter life-sized marble sculpture, &quot;The Shipwrecked Mariner&quot;, depicting a sailor reaching desperately from a raft. Charles Spencer has since moved it from the main portico of Gardener&#x27;s House to the main house where it sits in the Painters Passage. 

Both of the North and South West Lodges of Althorp date to around 1730 under Roger Morris and are both built from lias ashlar with slate roofs. The North and South East Lodges date to around 1810 and are built from limestone ashlar with slate roofs. All four buildings became Grade II listed buildings in November 1954. The Grade II listed Dairy Cottage, to the northwest of the lake, dates to the late 18th century under Henry Holland, and was listed in December 1986. It is a two-storey building with an attic and hipped roof. It has a 19th-century central door and a surrounding porch &quot;flanked by casements under flat arch heads&quot;.

==Grounds==

The estate of Althorp covers an area of at least , and not only includes the house grounds but areas of woodland, cottages, farms, and surrounding hamlets. The soil in the area is of a rich, dark-coloured loam, and the estate is situated mainly on Jurassic Clay between and above sea level, with the highest area lying in the southeast of Althorp on Northampton Sand. Within the grounds, there are earthworks of the lost village of Althorp on which the estate was built. To the southwest of the house is High Wood, with the Dog Pond to the east of this. Bircham Spinney is immediately to east, to the south of the pond. Hopyard Spinney lies in the north-east corner of the estate bordering the A428, and Sir John&#x27;s Wood marks the northwest corner. Sir John&#x27;s Wood is named after John Spencer who was responsible for the planting of a number of woods on the grounds in the latter half of the 16th century. One tablet mentions he planted one of the woods in 1567–1568 and Sir John&#x27;s Wood in 1589, at a time when lords of manors around Britain grew increasingly anxious of their security following the Spanish Armada and planted woodlands around their properties. Between 1567 and 1901 at least seven stone date tablets were erected in the park commemorating the planting of trees. In the north and north-eastern part of Althorp is marshy ground which is natural feeding ground for herons, a prized delicacy historically at the house. They were harvested by the gamekeeper usually from early March, after being fattened up by meal and bullock&#x27;s liver. In 1842 one hundred nests were recorded at the estate but this had fallen to ten by 1889. The herons were moved to a pond about two miles away in 1993 and are no longer produced for domestic consumption at Althorp. Northampton Golf Club, established in July 1893, is situated immediately to the southeast of Althorp.

Robert Spencer hired the French landscape architect André Le Nôtre to lay out the park and grounds in the 1660s. A map by Jan Kip which appeared in &quot;Britannia Illustrata&quot; (1709) showed the result of the changes, depicting the house with a wide rectangular courtyard on the main south front, a formal walled garden structured by rectangular-shaped flower-beds and lawns to the east, and tree-lined avenues to the north and south. During the renovation under Holland in the 18th century, the lake was drained in the deer park, which the First Earl had used as a playground with full-sized Venetian gondolas, and remaining traces of the old moat were eradicated. From 1860 onwards the architect William Milford Teulon (1823–1900) updated the gardens at Althorp, and further additions and changes were made in the 1990s under Dan Pearson when the Diana memorial was established and many trees planted. After Teulon&#x27;s additions, the Spencers began growing its own fruit and vegetables and flowers. In 1901 a variety of sweet pea, now known &quot;Spencer type&quot;, with &quot;flowers of exceptional size and of an exquisite shade of pink&quot;, was cultivated at Althorp by Silas Cole, the chief gardener to the Fifth Earl Spencer, and exhibited at horticultural shows.

===Diana grave, memorial, and exhibition===
Diana, Princess of Wales, was interred on a small island in the middle of the ornamental Round Oval lake, which was created by Teulon in 1868. The island was decided as the best place to lay her to rest because the water would, according to Spencer, &quot;act as a buffer against the interventions of the insane and ghoulish, the thick mud presenting a further line of defence. We all agreed that, with its beauty and tranquillity, this was the place for Diana to be&quot;. The ground was consecrated by the Bishop of Peterborough prior to the burial. Her burial place is marked with a white memorial plinth and urn.

A Doric-style temple with Diana&#x27;s name inscribed on top is situated across from the lake, as a place where visitors can lay down their floral tributes to the princess. It contains a black silhouette of her in the middle, set in white marble, evocative of the Henry Holland&#x27;s material preference, with a tablet on either side. One tablet displays a quote from Diana about her love of charitable work, and the other holds Charles Spencer&#x27;s concluding tribute given at her funeral in Westminster Abbey. The temple was originally commissioned by George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer, to thank God for the British victory in the Battle of the Nile.
Following the death of Diana on 31 August 1997 and the subsequent decision to create a memorial and open the house and estate to the public, the garden designer Dan Pearson was commissioned to update the park and gardens, to accommodate for visitors. A series of 36 oak trees was planted along the access road, symbolic of the years of Diana&#x27;s life. Thousands of plants were planted, including 100 white rambling roses on the island and 1000 white water lilies, donated by Stowe School, in the water around it.

The estate stable block was converted into a public exhibition devoted to the memory of Diana, and open between 1998 and 2013, It was designed by Rasshied Ali Din, who had to seek approval from English Heritage due to it being a Grade II listed building. Din said of the result, &quot;You have a contrast of the modern and the new with the old and the established, which is basically a metaphor for Diana. She was a very modern woman within an established environment.&quot; He created six rooms out of the former carriage houses and stabling areas, and the old tea room was transformed into a restaurant, and toilets installed for visitors.

The first room was called &quot;Spencer Women&quot;, placing Diana in context to the women of her family, with paintings and jewellery of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, and portraits of Georgiana Spencer etc. The next room contained four minutes of edited video footage of Diana as a child to show to the world that she did not simply come into being in 1980 when she became the girlfriend of Prince Charles. It featured footage of Diana at her christening, her first winter, her first birthday, her first steps, and footage displaying her affection for animals, swimming, and leaving for boarding school. The room also contained her tuck-box, toy typewriter, ballet shoes, and a childhood photo album.

A third room documented the Royal Wedding and its &quot;glamour and excitement&quot;, with a display of the David Emanuel wedding dress she wore on 29 July 1981. A fourth room documented her extensive charitable and humanitarian work through video footage edited by Tim Ashton, and a fifth, known as the &quot;Tribute Room&quot;.

The sixth room was the Exhibition, which was a celebration of her life, and contained large glass cases at the sides with dummies of Diana wearing her notable suits and dresses, with the occasions documented on cards on the floor in front of them. A great glass case at the end underneath a stylish black and white photograph contained a selected few hundred of the thousands of condolence books the Spencers received from around the world, designed to give a &quot;final sense of scale to the impact of Diana&#x27;s life and of her death&quot;. A sleek, silk-bound copy of the address that her brother Charles delivered at Diana&#x27;s funeral was available for £25.

The estate and house are open to the public during the summer months (1 July to 30 August), although the exhibition centre in the stable block was closed in August 2013. It was believed to be due to concern about the commercial exploitation of Diana&#x27;s name, and the desire to &quot;squash the cult of Diana&quot;. The items on display have been packed up, with the intention to give them to her sons William and Harry. All profits made were donated to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, which closed in 2012.

==Haunting==
Although the current owner, Charles Spencer, professes to have never witnessed a ghost at Althorp or anywhere else, over the years numerous ghostly sightings have been reported in the mansion. In the mid-19th century the Dean of Lincoln was invited to stay at the property by Frederick, 4th Earl Spencer. He complained the following morning that during the night a figure dressed as a groom (believed to be the ghost of the deceased servant of the 3rd Earl) had entered his room holding candles and checking that they were snuffed out around the bed. Lady Margaret Douglas-Home professed to being aware of a ghost of a girl with grey slippers in the gallery.

<doc id="199686" wikidata="Q3772911" url="?curid=199686" title="Gold penny">
<text>The gold penny was a medieval English coin with a value of twenty pence (i.e. pound sterling), minted in 1257 during the reign of Henry III. The coin was short-lived as it quickly became undervalued, which led to its almost complete disappearance; only eight known coins exist.

== History ==

=== Need for higher value coins ===

Until the reign of King Henry III of England (1216–1272), any need in England for coins worth more than one penny, at the time a silver coin, was met by the use of Byzantine or Arabic gold and silver coins which circulated among merchants and traders. However, as commerce increased, so did the need for higher value coins. In 1257, Henry instructed his goldsmith, William of Gloucester, to produce a coinage of pure gold.

=== Introduction and use ===

The gold penny was introduced, with a value of twenty pence. The coin&#x27;s obverse showed the king enthroned, in his royal attire, with a scepter in his right hand and a &quot;globus cruciger&quot; in his left, with the legend (King Henry III). The reverse contained a long cross extending to the edge, with a flower in each quarter, and the moneyer&#x27;s name in the legend, thus (William of London). Some examples read or instead of .

The gold penny was not popular. Thomas Carte, in his &quot;A general history of England&quot;, says that the citizens of London made a representation against them on 24 November 1257, and that &quot;the King was so willing to oblige them, that he published a proclamation, declaring that nobody was obliged to take it [the gold penny], and whoever did, might bring it to his exchange, and receive there the value at which it had been made current, one halfpenny only being deducted from each, most probably for the expense of coinages&quot;.

=== Valuation and melting ===

Compared to its bullion weight, the coin was undervalued. By 1265, the gold in the coin was worth twenty-four pence rather than twenty, and it is believed that most of the coins were melted down for profit by individuals. Gold coins would not be minted again in England until the reign of King Edward III about seventy years later.

=== Disappearance ===

As all the coins were recalled and melted down, the gold penny completely disappeared from view, and all knowledge of its prior existence was forgotten. However, in the 1700s, documentation came to light indicating that it had been minted. Inevitably, a few coins escaped the melt—perhaps being lost.

== Surviving examples ==

Eight examples are now known to survive. The most recent was discovered in September 2021 by amateur detectorist Michael Leigh-Mallory in a field in Hemyock, Devon. It sold at auction for £648,000 in January 2022.

<text>The Canal Museum, formerly known as the &quot;National Waterways Museum Stoke Bruerne&quot; and &quot;The Canal Museum at Stoke Bruerne&quot;, is a canal museum located next to the Grand Union Canal just south of the Blisworth Tunnel, near the village of Stoke Bruerne in Northamptonshire. It is about north of Milton Keynes and south of Northampton near junction 15 of the M1 motorway.

==History==

The museum was established in 1963, as &quot;The Canal Museum&quot;. It was founded by two canal workers and enthusiasts, Charles N. Hadlow, the first curator, and Jack James, its first caretaker, whose personal collections formed the main part of its initial exhibits.

It was subsequently known as the &quot;National Waterways Museum Stoke Bruerne&quot;, one of three museums operated by The Waterways Trust that focused on the history of canals in Britain. After the creation of the Canal &amp; River Trust in 2010, the Stoke Bruerne museum was rebranded to its original name.

==Museum==

The museum is housed in a restored Grade II listed corn mill at the top of a flight of canal locks, and is one of several museums and attractions operated by the Canal &amp; River Trust, the successor to The Waterways Trust.

The museum tells the story of Britain&#x27;s inland waterways and the people who worked on them. It provides an insight into the transport system which was fundamental to the Industrial Revolution in Britain. There are working models and 3-D displays including a model of the short-lived inclined-plane mechanical lift at Foxton in Leicestershire. Exhibits include models of working boats including narrow boats, barges, butties and tugs, painted ware and canal crafts, traditional clothing, canal-side signs and specialist tools.

The museum has a shop and café, and a school/activity room available for educational visits.

<doc id="199689" wikidata="Q191423" url="?curid=199689" title="Domenico Ghirlandaio">
<text>Domenico di Tommaso Curradi di Doffo Bigordi (2 June 1448 – 11 January 1494), professionally known as Domenico Ghirlandaio (also spelt as Ghirlandajo), was an Italian Renaissance painter born in Florence. Ghirlandaio was part of the so-called &quot;third generation&quot; of the Florentine Renaissance, along with Verrocchio, the Pollaiolo brothers and Sandro Botticelli. 

Ghirlandaio led a large and efficient workshop that included his brothers Davide Ghirlandaio and Benedetto Ghirlandaio, his brother-in-law Bastiano Mainardi from San Gimignano, and later his son Ridolfo Ghirlandaio. Many apprentices passed through Ghirlandaio&#x27;s workshop, including Michelangelo. 

His particular talent lay in his ability to posit depictions of contemporary life and portraits of contemporary people within the context of religious narratives, bringing him great popularity and many large commissions.

==Life and works==

===Early years===
Ghirlandaio was born Domenico di Tommaso di Currado di Doffo Bigordi. He was the eldest of six children born to Tommaso Bigordi by his first wife Antonia di ser Paolo Paoli; of these, only Domenico and his brothers and collaborators Davide and Benedetto Ghirlandaio survived childhood. Tommaso had two more children by his second wife, also named Antonia, whom he married in 1464. Domenico&#x27;s half-sister Alessandra (b. 1475) married the painter Bastiano Mainardi in 1494. Both Ghirlandaio&#x27;s father and his uncle, Antonio, were &quot;setaiuolo a minuto&quot; (dealers of silks and related objects in small quantities).

Giorgio Vasari reported that Domenico was at first apprenticed to his father, who was a goldsmith. The nickname &quot;Il Ghirlandaio&quot; (garland-maker) came to Domenico from his father, who was famed for creating the metallic garland-like headdresses worn by Florentine women. According to Vasari, Domenico made portraits of the passers-by and visitors to the shop: &quot;when he painted the country people or anyone who passed through his studio he immediately captured their likeness&quot;. He was eventually apprenticed to Alesso Baldovinetti to study painting and mosaic. According to the art historian Günter Passavent, he was apprenticed in Florence to Andrea del Verrocchio. He maintained a close association with other Florentine painters including Botticelli and with the Umbrian painter Perugino.

===First works in Florence, Rome, and Tuscany===
Ghirlandaio excelled in the painting of frescos and it is for his fresco cycles that he is best known. An early commission came to him in the 1470s from the Commune of San Gimignano to decorate the Chapel of Santa Fina in the Collegiate Church of that city. The frescos, executed from 1477 to 1478, depict two miraculous events associated with the death of Saint Fina.

In 1480, Ghirlandaio painted &quot;St. Jerome in His Study&quot; as a companion piece to Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;Saint Augustine in His Study&quot; in the Church of Ognissanti, Florence. He also painted a life-sized &quot;Last Supper&quot; in its refectory. From 1481 to 1485, he was employed on frescoes at the Palazzo Vecchio, painting among other works an &quot;Apotheosis of St. Zenobius&quot; (1482) in the &quot;Sala del Giglio&quot;, an over-life-sized work with an elaborate architectural framework, figures of Roman heroes, and other secular details, striking in its perspective and compositional skill.

In 1481, Ghirlandaio was summoned to Rome by Pope Sixtus IV as one of a team of Florentine and Umbrian painters who he commissioned to create a series of frescos depicting popes and scenes from the Old and New Testaments on the walls of the Sistine Chapel. Ghirlandaio painted the &quot;Vocation of the Apostles&quot;. He also painted the now lost &quot;Resurrection of Christ&quot;. &quot;The Crossing of the Red Sea&quot; has also been attributed to him, but is consistent with the style of Cosimo Roselli who was also part of the commission. Ghirlandaio is known to have created other works in Rome, now lost. His future brother-in-law, Sebastiano Mainardi, assisted him with these commissions and in the early frescoes at San Gimignano where Mainardi is now thought to have painted an &quot;Annunciation&quot; sometimes attributed to Ghirlandaio.

In 1484, an agent of Ludovico il Moro wrote to his lord, describing the works of the individual artists whose works he had seen in Florence: &quot;Domenico Ghirlandaio [is] a good painter on panel and better in mural fresco; his style is very good; he is active and very creative.&quot;

===Later works in Tuscany===

Between 1482 and 1485, Ghirlandaio painted a fresco cycle in the Sassetti Chapel of Santa Trinita for the banker Francesco Sassetti, the powerful director of the Medici bank, whose Rome branch was headed by Giovanni Tornabuoni, Ghirlandaio&#x27;s future patron. The cycle was of six scenes from the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, including &quot;Saint Francis obtaining from Pope Honorius the Approval of the Rules of His Order&quot;, the saint&#x27;s &quot;Death and Obsequies&quot; and a &quot;Resuscitation&quot; of a child of the Spini family, who had died as a result of a fall from a window. The first of these paintings contains portraits of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, Sassetti and Lorenzo&#x27;s children with their tutor, Agnolo Poliziano. The &quot;Resuscitation&quot; shows the painter&#x27;s own likeness.

In 1483, there arrived in Florence a masterpiece of the Flemish painter Hugo van der Goes. Now known as the &quot;Portinari Altarpiece&quot;, it was an &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot;, commissioned by Tommaso Portinari, an employee of the Medici Bank. The painting was in oil paint, not the tempera employed in Florence, and demonstrated the flexibility of that medium in the painting of textures and intensity of light and shade. The aspect of the painting that had a profound effect on Ghirlandaio was the naturalism with which the shepherds were depicted.

Ghirlandaio painted the altarpiece of the Sassetti chapel, an &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot;, in 1485. It is in this painting that he particularly shows his indebtedness to the &quot;Portinari Altarpiece&quot;. The shepherds, among whom is a self-portrait of the artist, are portrayed with a realism that was an advance in Florentine painting at that time. The altarpiece is still in position in Santa Trinita, surrounded by the six frescoes depicting the &quot;Life of St. Francis&quot; of which it became the centrepiece. On either side are portraits of the kneeling donors, and although the figures are in fresco on the wall, they occupy the same position and relationship to the central scene of the Adoration that the donors do on the outer panels of the &quot;Portinari triptych.&quot;

Immediately after the commission for the Sassetti Chapel, Ghirlandaio was asked to renew the frescoes in the choir of the Santa Maria Novella, which formed the chapel of the Ricci family. The Tornabuoni and Tornaquinci families, who were much more prominent than the Ricci, undertook the cost of the restoration, with certain contractual conditions. The Tornabuoni Chapel frescoes were painted in four courses around the three walls between 1485 and 1490, the subjects being the lives of the Virgin Mary and St. John the Baptist.
In this cycle, there are no fewer than twenty-one portraits of the Tornabuoni and Tornaquinci families. In the &quot;Angel appearing to Zacharias&quot;, there are portraits of members of the Medici Academy: Agnolo Poliziano, Marsilio Ficino and others. The Tornabuoni Chapel was completed in 1490 with the altarpiece probably executed with the assistance of Domenico&#x27;s brothers, Davide and Benedetto; and a stained glass window to Ghirlandaio&#x27;s own design. Domenico painted an altarpiece for Giovanni Tornabuoni to commemorate his first wife who had died in childbirth, as had Giovanni&#x27;s mother. &quot;The Virgin with the Two Marys&quot; is now in the Louvre. It is the only time that the two Marys are seen without Mary Magdalen. They usually are depicted together as the Three Marys. However, Mary Magdalene was never pregnant so was not a fitting subject for this altarpiece.
Although mainly known for his fresco cycles Ghirlandaio painted a number of altarpieces including the &quot;Virgin Adored by Saints Zenobius, Justus and Others&quot;, painted for the church of Saint Justus, now in the Uffizi Gallery and the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; in the Florentine orphanage, the Ospedale degli Innocenti, in which he included a self-portrait. Other panel paintings include &quot;Christ in Glory with Romuald and Other Saints&quot;, in the Badia of Volterra and the &quot;Visitation&quot; now in the Louvre, which bears the last ascertained date (1491) of all his works. Ghirlandaio painted a number of panel portraits of known identities, such as his profile portrait of Giovanna Tornabuoni, commissioned in 1488. Perhaps his best known is the &quot;Portrait of an Old Man and his Grandson&quot;, remarkable for both the tenderness of expression and the realism with which the disfigured nose (rhinophyma) of the old man is depicted.

According to Vasari, Ghirlandaio also painted several scenes of Classical subjects with nude figures, including a &quot;Vulcan and his Assistants forging Thunderbolts&quot;, for Lorenzo II de&#x27; Medici, but which no longer exists. He also produced designs for a number of mosaics including the &quot;Annunciation&quot;, on a portal of the Florence Cathedral.

===Death===
Ghirlandaio died on 11 January 1494 of &quot;pestilential fever&quot; and was buried in Santa Maria Novella. The day and month of his birth remain undocumented, but he is recorded as having died in early January of his forty-fifth year. He had been married twice and left six children. One of his three sons, Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, also became a painter. Although he had a long line of descendants, the family name died out in the seventeenth century, when its last members entered monasteries.

==Critical assessment and legacy==
Ghirlandaio worked mainly in fresco, with a number of important works being executed in tempera. Vasari states that Ghirlandaio was the first to abandon, in great part, the use of gilding in his pictures, representing by painting any objects that were made of gold. This is not applicable to his entire oeuvre, as details in some paintings, for example, the altarpiece of the &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot; (now in Florence Academy) were rendered in gold leaf.

According to William Michael Rossetti, &quot;[Ghirlandaio&#x27;s] scheme of composition is grand and decorous; his chiaroscuro excellent, and especially his perspectives, which he would design on a very elaborate scale by the eye alone; his colour is more open to criticism, but this remark applies much less to the frescoes than the tempera-pictures, which are sometimes too broadly and crudely bright.&quot; According to Vasari, his sense of perspective was so acute that he made drawings of ancient Roman monuments such as the Colisseum in which he worked entirely by eye, that later proved to have mathematically accurate proportion and linear perspective when measured.

Ghirlandaio is credited as the teacher of Michelangelo. Francesco Granacci is another among his pupils. According to Vasari, these two were sent by Ghirlandaio to the Medici Academy, when Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici requested his two best pupils. Although Michelangelo regarded himself as primarily a sculptor, in the sixteenth century he was to follow his master as a painter of frescos, at the Sistine Chapel.

Ghirlandaio was highly praised by Vasari: &quot;[Ghirlandaio] who, from his talent and from the greatness and the vast number of his works, may be called one of the most important and most excellent masters of the age...&quot; In the nineteenth century Jacob Burckhardt and others praised him for his compositions, for his technical ability, and for the lifelike quality of his figures, seen by Archibald Joseph Crowe and Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle as being as innovative as those of Giotto had been. By the late nineteenth century the appreciation of his work had waned and it was not until 1994, the five-hundredth anniversary of the artist&#x27;s death, that interest in him was rekindled. At this time a symposium was held and subsequently in-depth monographs on the artist were published. Rosenauer comments on the usefulness of Ghirlandaio&#x27;s paintings as pictorial records for the historian.
