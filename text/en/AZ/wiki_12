<text>Dhrupad is a genre in Hindustani classical music from the Indian subcontinent. It is the oldest known style of major vocal styles associated with Hindustani classical music (for example in the Haveli Sangeet of Pushtimarg Sampradaya), and is also related to the South Indian Carnatic tradition. It is a term of Sanskrit origin, derived from &quot;dhruva&quot; (ध्रुव, immovable, permanent) and &quot;pada&quot; (पद, verse). The roots of Dhrupad are ancient. It is discussed in the Hindu Sanskrit text &quot;Natyashastra&quot; (~200 BCE – 200 CE), and other ancient and medieval Sanskrit texts, such as chapter 33 of Book 10 in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; (~800–1000 CE), where the theories of music and devotional songs for Krishna are summarized.

The term denotes both the verse form of the poetry and the style in which it is sung. It is spiritual, heroic, thoughtful, virtuous, embedding moral wisdom or solemn form of song-music combination. Thematic matter ranges from the religious and spiritual (mostly in praise of Hindu deities) to royal panegyrics, musicology and romance.

A Dhrupad has at least four stanza, called Sthayi (or Asthayi), Antara, Sanchari and Abhoga. The Sthayi part is a melody that uses the middle octave&#x27;s first tetrachord and the lower octave notes. The Antara part uses the middle octave&#x27;s second tetrachord and the higher octave notes. The Sanchari part is the development phase, which holistically builds using parts of Sthayi and Antara already played, and it uses melodic material built with all the three octave notes. The Abhoga is the concluding section, that brings the listener back to the familiar starting point of Sthayi, albeit with rhythmic variations, with diminished notes like a gentle goodbye, that are ideally mathematical fractions such as (half), (third) or (fourth). Sometimes a fifth stanza called Bhoga is included. Though usually related to philosophical or Bhakti (emotional devotion to a god or goddess) themes, some Dhrupads were composed to praise kings.

The tradition of Dhrupad is recorded back to saints of Braj (Mathura) namely Swami Haridas, Surdas, Govind Swami, Asht Sakha of Haveli Sangeet and followed by Tansen (Gwalior) and Baiju Bawara (Gwalior). When Dhrupad composition are based on Bhagwan Shri Vishnu or his incarnations thereof, is called Vishnupad.

==History==
Dhrupad probably obtained its name from &quot;dhruvapada&quot; mentioned in &quot;Natyashastra&quot; to denote structured songs. It is one of the core forms of classical music found all over the Indian subcontinent. The word comes from &quot;Dhruva&quot; which means immovable and permanent. It is spiritual, heroic, thoughtful, virtuous, embedding moral wisdom or solemn form of song-music combination. The &quot;Yugala Shataka&quot; of Shri Shribhatta in the &quot;Nimbarka Sampradaya&quot;, written in 1294 CE, contains Dhrupad lyrics.

The earliest source that mentions a musical genre called &quot;Dhrupad&quot; is Ain-i-Akbari of Abu Fazl (1593). Extensive works attribute much of the material to musicians in the court of Man Singh Tomar (fl. 1486–1516) of Gwalior. In these accounts from the Mughal court Dhrupad is portrayed as a musical form which is relatively new; and according to Sanyal, most sources agree that Drupad owes its origin to the court of Man Singh Tomar. Ravi Shankar states that the form appeared in the fifteenth century as a development from the &quot;prabandha&quot;, which it replaced. The 16th century Bhakti saint and poet-musician Swami Haridas (also in the &quot;Nimbarka Sampradaya&quot;), was a well known dhrupad singer with songs dedicated to Krishna. It became the court music in the Mughal court with Swami Haridas&#x27; pupil Tansen famous, among other things, for his Dhrupad compositions.

Dhrupad is ancient, and another genre of music called Khyal (Gwalior) (it has two parts Sthayi and Antara) evolved from it. Dhrupad is solemn music, uplifting and heroic, pure and spiritual. Khyal adds ornamental notes, shorter, moody and celebratory.

The ancient practice of dancing on Dhrupad has been reintroduced into recent times by Dr. Puru Dadheech. Dr Dadheech is India&#x27;s Kathak dancer to bring &#x27;Dhrupad&#x27; on the formal Kathak stage and this composition in 28 matra.

==Nature and practice==

Dhrupad as it is known today is performed by a solo singer or a small number of singers in unison to the beat of the &quot;pakhavaj&quot; rather than the tabla. The vocalist is usually accompanied by two tanpuras, the players sitting close behind, with the percussionist at the right of the vocalist. Traditionally the primary instrument used for dhrupad has been the Rudra Veena, but the surbahar and the sursringar have also long been used for this music. Preferably, any instrument used for Dhrupad should have a deep bass register and long sustain.

Like all Indian classical music, dhrupad is modal and monophonic, with a single melodic line and no chord progression. Each raga has a modal frame - a wealth of micro-tonal ornamentations (&quot;gamak&quot;) are typical.

The text is preceded by a wholly improvised section, the &quot;alap&quot;. The alap in dhrupad is sung using a set of syllables, popularly derived from a Vedic mantras and beejakshars, in a recurrent, set pattern: &quot;a re ne na, té te re ne na, ri re re ne na, te ne toom ne&quot; (this last group is used in the end of a long phrase). These syllables are also used widely in different permutations and combinations. Dhrupad styles have long elaborate &quot;alaps&quot;, their slow and deliberate melodic development gradually bringing an accelerating rhythmic pulse. In most styles of dhrupad singing it can easily last an hour, broadly subdivided into the &quot;alap&quot; proper (unmetered), the &quot;jor&quot; (with steady rhythm) and the &quot;jhala&quot; (accelerating strumming) or &quot;nomtom&quot;, when syllables are sung at a very rapid pace. Then the composition is sung to the rhythmic accompaniment: the four lines, in serial order, are termed &quot;sthayi&quot;, &quot;antara&quot;, &quot;sanchari&quot; and &quot;aabhog&quot;.

Compositions exist in the metres (&quot;tala&quot;) (7 beats), &quot;sul&quot; (10 beats) and &quot;chau&quot; (12 beats) - a composition set to the 10-beat &quot;jhap&quot; tala is called a sadra while one set to the 14-beat &quot;dhamar&quot; is called a &quot;dhamar&quot;. The latter is seen as a lighter musical form, associated with the Holi spring festival.

Alongside concert performance, the practice of singing dhrupad in temples continues, though only a small number of recordings have been made. It bears little resemblance to concert dhrupad: there is very little or no alap; percussion such as bells and finger cymbals, not used in the classical setting, are used here, and the drum used is a smaller, older variant called &quot;mrdang&quot;, quite similar to the mridangam.

==Gharanas and style==
&quot;Brihaddeshi&quot;, a circa eighth-century text attributed to Mataṅga, classifies songs into five stylistic categories (): , , , , and . Four styles ( or ) of dhrupad singing were popular in the late sixteenth century at Mughal Emperor Akbar&#x27;s court: , , , and . Tradition traces the origin of the four back to the five , but there is no solid evidence of a connection.

There are a number of dhrupad &quot;gharanas&quot;: &quot;houses&quot;, or family styles.

The best-known gharana is the Dagar family, who sing in the Dagar vani or Dagar gharana. The Dagar style puts great emphasis on alap and for several generations their singers have performed in pairs (often pairs of brothers). The Dagars are Muslims but sing Hindu texts of Gods and Goddesses.

The Bishnupur gharana features Manilal Nag, Mita Nag, and Madhuvanti Pal among others.

From the state of Bihar comes the Darbhanga gharana, Dumraon gharana (Buxar) and the Bettiah gharana. The Mallicks of the Darbhanga gharana are linked to the Khandar vani and Gauharvani. Ram Chatur Mallick, Vidur Mallick, Abhay Narayan Mallick, Pandit Sanjay Kumar Mallick, Laxman Bhatt Tailang and Siyaram Tiwari were well known personalities of Darbhanga gharana in the 20th century. Dhrupad of the Darbhanga gharana has a strong representation in Vrindaban owing to late Pandit Vidur Mallik, who lived and taught in Vrindaban during the 1980s and 1990s. Great female Dhrupad artists include Asgari Bai, Alaka Nandy, Ashoka Dhar, Madhu Bhatt Tailang, the Pakistani singer Aliya Rasheed, and the Italian singer Amelia Cuni.

Dumraon gharana - Dhrupad traditions of Bihar Dumraon gharana is an ancient tradition of dhrupad music nearly 500 years old. This gharana flourished under the patronage of the kings of Dumraon Raj when it was founded. The drupad style (vanis) of this gharana is &quot;Gauhar&quot;, &quot;Khandar&quot;, and &quot;Nauharvani&quot;. The founder of this gharana was Pt. Manikchand Dubey and Pt. Anup chand Dubey. Both artists were awarded by Mugal Emperor Shahjahan. The father of Bharat Ratna Ustad Bismillah Khan who also belonged to the Dumraon gharana tradition. He usually played Shahnai in Dhrupad style. Famous living singers of Dumraon gharana (Buxar) include Pt. Ramjee Mishra, a representative of Dumraon gharana.

Many books have been written by this gharana, like Shree Krishn Ramayan, by Pt. Ghana rang Dubey, Sur-prakash, Bhairav, Prakash, Rash-Prakash, written by Jay Prakash Dubey and Prakash Kavi. Abishek Sangit Pallav by Dr. Arvind Kumar.

The Mishras practised Gaurhar, Dagur, Nauhar and Khandar styles. This gharana flourished under the patronage of the kings of Bettiah Raj. Pandit Falguni Mitra is an exponent of this gharana in the present generation.

Some of the illustrious Dhrupad exponents and virtuosos are Pandit Gokulotsavji Maharaj, Uday Bhawalkar, Ritwik Sanyal, Nirmalya Dey, Pt. Kshitipall Mallick, Pt. Ram Chatur Mallick and the Gundecha Brothers.

==Seminars==
In an effort to link tradition and scientific methodologies, the ITC Sangeet Research Academy&#x27;s Scientific Research Department has been organizing symposia and workshops since 1987. The objective of these workshops/symposia is to create awareness of research in various fields of music. In 2013 the academy conducted a Dhrupad seminar in association with the National Centre for the Performing Arts (India) (NCPA, Mumbai) where Dr. Puru Dadheech participated as speaker to discuss the origin and predecessors of Dhrupad.

Prof. Richard Widdess (Head, Department of Music, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, UK) and Dr. Dadheech, (Indore, India) discussed the origin of Dhrupad at length. The latter established that Dhrupads are older than the times of Raja Mansingh Tomar.

==Documentaries==
The filmmaker Mani Kaul while under tutelage of Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar and Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar made one of the first documentaries on Dhrupad music in 1982 called &quot;Dhrupad&quot;. This Hindi language full-length documentary features both his gurus along with the young Bahauddin Dagar - the son of Zia Mohiuddin Dagar. The film produced by the Films Division of India was shot in locations associated with history of Dhrupad in – Fatehpur Sikri and Jaipur&#x27;s Jantar Mantar articulating the theory and the practice of the musical form.

<doc id="200333" wikidata="Q1046659" url="?curid=200333" title="Casablanca-class escort carrier">
<text>The &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier was a series of escort carriers constructed for the United States Navy during World War II. They are the most numerous class of aircraft carriers ever built. Fifty were laid down, launched and commissioned within the space of less than two years – 3 November 1942 through to 8 July 1944. Despite their numbers, and the preservation of more famous and larger carriers as museums, none of these modest ships survive today. Five were lost to enemy action during World War II and the remainder were scrapped.

&quot;Casablanca&quot; was the first class designed from keel up as an escort carrier. It had a larger and more useful hangar deck than previous conversions. It also had a larger flight deck than the . Unlike larger carriers which had extensive armor, protection was limited to splinter plating. Their small size made them useful for transporting assembled aircraft of various sizes, including ferrying many aircraft types that were unable to operate from their decks. However, aircraft that were operational on the ships were limited to smaller and lighter aircraft such as the Grumman F4F Wildcat. The hull numbers were assigned consecutively, from CVE-55 &quot;Casablanca&quot; to CVE-104 &quot;Munda&quot;.
&quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers were built by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company&#x27;s Vancouver Yard on the Columbia River in Vancouver, Washington. The Vancouver yard was expressly built in 1942 to construct Liberty ships, but exigencies of war soon saw the yard building LST landing craft and then escort carriers all before the end of the yard&#x27;s first year in operation. The yard had twelve building ways and a outfitting dock along with a unique additional building slip originally intended to add prefabricated superstructures to Liberty ships. Their relatively small size and mass-production origins led their crews to refer to them as &quot;jeep carriers&quot; or &quot;Kaiser Jeeps&quot; with varying degrees of affection.

==Naming==
The &quot;Casablanca&quot; class initially continued the US Navy&#x27;s policy of naming escort carriers after bays and sounds, in this case the numerous inlets of the Alexander Archipelago that form the southeast coastline of Alaska, though several were subsequently renamed to carry on the US Navy&#x27;s tradition of naming aircraft carriers after battles. Those ships that appear to be named after islands, seas, straits or cities actually commemorated battles fought at those locations. Several had their original &quot;Bay&quot; names changed to battle names while under construction, and two of them, &quot;Midway&quot; (CVE-63) and &quot;Coral Sea&quot; (CVE-57), lost their battle names mid-career to new s, becoming and respectively. Unlike the larger and s, none were named to commemorate historical naval vessels.

== Production time and Navy refusal ==

Although &quot;Essex&quot;-class aircraft carriers were completed in 20 months or less, 1941 projections on the basis of the 38-month average pre-war construction period estimated no new fleet carriers could be expected until 1944. Kaiser had reduced construction time of cargo ships (Liberty ships) from more than a year to less than 90 days, and proposed building a fleet of 50 small carriers in less than two years. The US naval authorities refused to approve construction of the Kaiser-built ships until Kaiser went directly to the President&#x27;s advisers. The Allies were in desperate need of carriers to replace early war losses. Kaiser produced the small carriers as rapidly as planned and resistance to their value quickly disappeared as they proved their usefulness defending convoys, providing air support for amphibious operations, and allowing fleet carriers to focus on offensive air-strike missions. Unlike most other large warships since , the &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class ships were equipped with uniflow reciprocating engines instead of steam turbines. This was done because of bottlenecks in the gear-cutting industry, but greatly limited their usefulness after the war.

==Service==


Although designated as convoy escort carriers, the &quot;Casablanca&quot; class was far more frequently used in large fleet amphibious operations, where speed was less important and their small airgroups could combine to provide the effectiveness of a much larger ship.

Their finest hour came in the Battle off Samar, when Taffy 3, a task unit composed of six of these ships and their screen of three destroyers and four destroyer escorts gave battle against the Japanese main battle force (&quot;Center Force&quot;). Their desperate defense not only preserved most of their own ships, but succeeded in turning back the massive force with only their aircraft joined by aircraft from Taffy 1 and 2 comprised additional &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers, machine guns, torpedoes, depth charges, high-explosive bombs, and their own 5-inch/38-caliber guns. Tasked with ground support and antisubmarine patrols, they lacked the torpedoes and armor-piercing bombs to tackle a surface fleet alone. Taffy 3 was to be protected by Admiral Halsey&#x27;s Third Fleet with carriers and battleships. But the Third Fleet had left the scene to pursue a decoy carrier fleet, inadvertently leaving Taffy 3 the only force between the massive Japanese fleet and undefended landing forces at Leyte Gulf. The lightly armed vessels each had only one 5-inch/38 cal gun mounted aft, yet two of their number, and , became the only US aircraft carriers to ever record a hit on an enemy warship by its own guns. &quot;St. Lo&quot; hit a Japanese destroyer with a single round and &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; damaged a with two hits. In addition, the gun crew on may have struck the cruiser &quot;Chōkai&quot;, with up to six 5-inch shells. One of these rounds may even have caused a large secondary explosion – probably from one of &quot;Chōkai&quot;″s own torpedoes – on the starboard side that proved fatal to the heavy cruiser. &quot;White Plains&quot;″s gun crew claimed to have put all six 5-inch rounds into &quot;Chōkai&quot; from a range of , near the maximum effective range for the 5-inch/38 gun. However, Japanese sources attributed the loss of &quot;Chōkai&quot; to bomb damage from an air attack.

Another noteworthy achievement of the &quot;Casablanca&quot; class was when , under command of Captain Daniel V. Gallery, participated in the first capture-at-sea of a foreign warship by the US Navy since the War of 1812 when a crew of volunteers from boarded after Gallery&#x27;s &quot;Guadalcanal&quot;-centered hunter-killer group forced it to the surface with depth charges. &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; also earned the distinction of being the only aircraft carrier in history to conduct flight operations with a captured enemy vessel in tow.

==Notable incidents==
Of the eleven United States aircraft carriers of all types lost during World War II, six were escort carriers, five of which were of the Kaiser-built &quot;Casablanca&quot; class:

* CVE-56 &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;
Sunk 24 November 1943. Submarine torpedo launched from IJN &quot;I-175&quot; SW off Butaritari (Makin).
* CVE-73 &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;
Sunk 25 October 1944. Concentrated surface gunfire from IJN Center Force during Battle off Samar.
* CVE-63 &quot;St. Lo&quot; (ex-&quot;Midway&quot; ex-&quot;Chapin Bay&quot;)
Sunk 25 October 1944. Kamikaze aerial attack during Battle of Leyte Gulf.
* CVE-79 &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot;
Sunk 4 January 1945. Kamikaze aerial attack in the Sulu Sea en route to Lingayen Gulf.
* CVE-95 &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot;
Sunk 21 February 1945. Kamikaze aerial attack off Iwo Jima.
*CVE-96 &quot;Anguilla Bay&quot; renamed USS &quot;Salamaua&quot; 
Damaged at Lingayen Gulf on 6 January 1945 after kamikaze with two 551-pound (250 kg) bombs hit her flight deck. She was repaired and put back in service.

==Post war==

Some ships were retained postwar as aircraft transports, where their lack of speed was not a major drawback. Some units were reactivated as helicopter escort carriers (CVHE and T-CVHE) or utility carriers (CVU and T-CVU) after the war, but most were deactivated and placed in reserve once the war ended, stricken in 1958-9 and scrapped in 1959–61. One ship, , was heavily modified into an amphibious assault ship (LPH-6), but was scrapped in 1966.

Originally, half of their number were to be transferred to the Royal Navy under Lend-Lease, but instead they were retained in the US Navy and the Batch II s were transferred instead as the (the RN&#x27;s Batch I &quot;Bogues&quot; were the &quot;Attacker&quot; class).

==Ships of the class==
All ships of the &quot;Casablanca&quot; class were built in Vancouver, Washington, by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company. The following ships of the class were constructed.

<text>The rondo is a musical form that contains a principal theme (sometimes called the &quot;refrain&quot;) which alternates with one or more contrasting themes, generally called &quot;episodes&quot;, but also occasionally referred to as &quot;digressions&quot; or &quot;couplets&quot;. Some possible patterns include: ABACA, ABACAB, ABACBA, or ABACABA.

The rondo form emerged in the Baroque period and became increasingly popular during the Classical period. The earliest examples of compositions employing rondo form are found within Italian opera arias and choruses of the first years of the 17th century. These examples use a multi-couplet rondo or chain rondo (ABACAD) known as the Italian rondo. 

Rondo form, also known in English by its French spelling rondeau, should not be confused with the unrelated and similarly named forme fixe rondeau; a 14th- and 15th-century French poetic and chanson form. While the origins of rondo form come from Italian opera, the French composer Jean-Baptiste Lully, who is sometimes referred to as the father of the rondo or rondeau form, and his contemporaries, Jacques Champion de Chambonnières and Louis Couperin popularized the rondo form in France in the 17th century. These composers were succeeded in the later Baroque period by French composers Jean-Marie Leclair, François Couperin, and most importantly Jean-Philippe Rameau who continued to be important exponents of music compositions utilizing rondo form. Lully was the first composer to utilize a two-couplet design to his rondo structure, a technique he did not consistently adopt but which was later adopted and standardized by Rameau whose construction of the rondo was codified by the 17th century music theorist Jean Du Breuil in what became known as the French rondeau.

These French composers employed rondo form in a wide range of media, including opera, ballet, choral music, art songs, orchestral music, chamber music, and works for solo instrument. The French spread the popularity of the form internationally, and the rondo was soon adopted in the late 17th century and early 18th century by composers in other nations such as Henry Purcell in England and Johann Sebastian Bach in Germany. While J.S. Bach&#x27;s rondos were written in the earlier French tradition of construction and were not particularly progressive, his son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach was a highly imaginative and unusually innovative composer in the rondo form; producing thirteen sophisticated and highly personal rondos which place him as a central figure in this form at the end of the Baroque period and early Classical period. 

By the beginning of the Classical period in 1750, the rondo form was already well established throughout Europe and the rondo form reached the height of its popularity in the late 18th century. During this period the rondo form was most frequently employed by composers as a single movement within a larger work; particularly concertos and serenades but also with less frequency in symphonies and chamber music. However, independent rondos were still written in this period, often as virtuoso pieces. Many European composers of this era used the rondo form, including the composers Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven who all produced a significant body of music employing rondo form. These three composers were also important exponents of the sonata rondo form; a musical form developed in the Classical period which blended the structures of the sonata form with the form of the rondo.

In the 19th century composers in the Romantic period continued to use the form with some regularity. Some Romantic era composers to produce music utilizing rondo form include Beethoven, Johannes Brahms, Antonín Dvořák, Felix Mendelssohn, Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Richard Strauss, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Rondo form has continued to be used by some 20th-century and 21st-century composers; most often by those with a Neoclassical aesthetic or by those composers referencing classical music composition in some fashion. Some 20th century composers to utilize rondo form include Alban Berg, Béla Bartók, Duke Ellington, Alberto Ginastera, Paul Hindemith, and Sergei Prokofiev.

==Etymology ==
The English word &quot;rondo&quot; comes from the Italian form of the French &quot;rondeau&quot;, which means &quot;a little round&quot;. Today the word rondo is widely used in the English language to refer to any musical work, vocal or instrumental, containing a principal theme which alternates with one or more contrasting themes. However, some English and German speaking composers have also adopted the term rondeau over the term rondo to refer to their compositions utilizing this form; particularly when writing in a French compositional style.

In France, the word &quot;rondeau&quot; was first used in the Medieval and Renaissance periods to refer to the &#x27;forme fixe &quot;rondeau&quot;&#x27;; a type of poetic and chanson form extant to France in the late 13th through 15th centuries. It originally developed as monophonic music (in the 13th century) and then as polyphonic music (in the 14th century). It disappeared from the repertoire by the beginning of the 16th century. Along with the formes fixes &quot;ballade&quot; and &quot;virelai&quot;, the forme fixe rondeau was limited to only vocal music due to its use within the specific context of French language poetry. 

The forme fixe &quot;rondeau&quot; is entirely unrelated to the later musical form &quot;rondeau&quot;, which emerged principally in mid 17th century France but had its origins in Italian opera of the late 16th and early 17th century. It is this later music form which is now known as rondo in English. In the 18th century the term Round O, an English corruption of the French word ‘rondeau’, was also sometimes used in the English language to refer to the musical form rondeau. The term Round O was used in several 18th century English publications, including Jeremiah Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Choice Lessons for the Harpsichord or Spinett&quot; (London, 1711) and John Hoyle&#x27;s &quot;A Complete Dictionary of Music&quot; (London, 1770). In James Grassineau &#x27;s &quot;A Musical Dictionary&quot; (1740) the term Round O was defined as an alternative spelling of rondeau.

==Definition and historical development==
In rondo form, a principal theme (sometimes called the &quot;refrain&quot;) alternates with one or more contrasting themes, generally called &quot;episodes&quot;, but also occasionally referred to as &quot;digressions&quot; or &quot;couplets&quot;. Possible patterns include: ABACA, ABACAB, ABACBA, or ABACABA. The &quot;ABACA&quot; is often referred as &quot;five-part rondo&quot;, the &quot;ABACAB&quot; and &quot;ABACBA&quot; are sometimes called &quot;six-part rondo&quot;, and the ABACABA is commonly known as &quot;seven-part rondo&quot;. The number of themes can vary from piece to piece, and the recurring element is sometimes embellished and/or shortened in order to provide for variation. Perhaps the best-known example of rondo form is Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Für Elise&quot;, an ABACA rondo.
===Origins in Italian opera===
Writers on the origin of the rondo form have made connections to the use and development of ritornello in early Italian opera at the very end of the 16th century and early 17th century. While rondo form is similar to ritornello form, it is different in that ritornello form typically brings back the subject or main theme in a paraphrase of that theme through the use of fragments from previous musical passages and in different keys; whereas the rondo brings back its theme complete and in the same key.

Ritornello, meaning &#x27;return&#x27; in Italian, has its origins in 15th century madrigals in which repetition or a return to particular stanza is a feature of the compositional structure. With the advent of opera in Italy in the very last years of the 16th century, ritornello form continued to develop specifically within the structure of the aria and opera chorus. Ritornello form was used in instrumental preludes, interludes or postludes (or any combination of these) within the aria and opera chorus; most frequently in the context of opera arias but also in 17th century sacred works such as vocal arias and choruses within oratorios and cantatas. Only 100 years later at the beginning of the 18th century was the ritornello technique transferred to the concerto; long after the rise of the rondo in France in the 17th century. 

The use and development of ritornello in the aria served a practical purpose; as the structure was used to clearly separate vocal sections of the aria from the instrumental preludes, interludes or postludes within the composition. Repeating or paraphrasing instrumental music in the structure of the aria provided a felicitous dramatic structure which could facilitate character entrances and exits, emphasize dramatic intent, or could provide music used with scene transformations or even accompaniments for dances. Ultimately, the use of ritornello in Italian opera led to the creation of some early Italian arias and opera choruses which follow a traditional rondo form in which the main theme is repeated in its entirety and in the same key. The earliest example of this is within Jacopo Peri&#x27;s &quot;Euridice&quot; (1600) in which the choruses &quot;Al canto al ballo&quot; and &quot;Sospirate aure celesti&quot; are arranged using a rondo structure. These early examples use a multi-couplet rondo or chain rondo (ABACAD) now known as the Italian rondo.

===Rondeau form in French Baroque music===
The rondo form, usually referred to in English using the French spelling rondeau when applied to French music, was a popular form in France from the mid to late 17th century and into the 18th century. The French composers of the Baroque period employed rondeau form in a wide range of media, including opera, ballet, choral music, art songs, orchestral music, chamber music, and works for solo instrument. The composer Jean-Baptiste Lully is sometime credited as the &#x27;father of the rondeau&#x27;, as he was allegedly the first composer to utilize a two-couplet design to his rondeau structure; a technique he did not consistently adopt but which was later adopted and standardized by Jean-Philippe Rameau whose construction of the rondeau was codified by the 17th century music theorist Jean Du Breuil in what became known as the French rondeau. Some examples of Lully&#x27;s use of the French rondeau include the &quot;Rondeau pour les basques&quot; from the ballet &quot;Intermède de Xerxes&quot; (1660), the &quot;Rondeau pour la gloire&quot; from the prologue of the opera &quot;Alceste&quot; (1674), and the chorus &quot;Suivons Armide&quot; from the opera &quot;Armide&quot; (1686).

Three other important early rondeau composers of the Baroque period included Jacques Champion de Chambonnières and the brothers Louis Couperin and François Couperin; all of whom wrote several rondeau for keyboard. Chambonnières composed a French rondeau for keyboard in F major simply titled &quot;Rondeau&quot;, and also composed many chaconnes-rondeaux; some of which follow the two-couplet design of the French rondeau but others displaying up to as many as five couplets. Louis Couperin was also experimental with the number of couplets he employed in his rondeau compositions; usually using three or four couplets in his rondeau construction. Louis&#x27;s &quot;Passacaille&quot; for harpsichord has a nine couplet rondeau form. François Couperin was the leading and most prolific French Baroque composer of rondeau composed for the harpsichord.

In the late part of the Baroque period, the composer Jean-Marie Leclair was a particularly innovative composer within the French rondeau form; especially within his aria movements for violin. Leclair was one of the earliest composers to change metre and tempo within a couplet such as in his op.1 no.9, &quot;Allegro ma non presto&quot;, and to contain a rondeau within a rondeau in the final couplet as in his opus 1 number 1, &quot;Aria&quot;.

===Spread of the rondeau form internationally===
The music of French Baroque composers like Lully and Rameau spread across Europe and influenced composers across the continent beginning in the late 17th century. Henry Purcell was one of the earliest composers in England to adopt the form; writing a &quot;Rondeau&quot; as the second movement of his music for the play &quot;Abdelazer&quot; by Aphra Behn which premiered at the Dorset Garden Theatre on July 3, 1676. In Germany, the composers Georg Muffat, Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer, and Johann Sebastian Bach all adopted French forms and techniques in some of their compositions; including utilization of the rondeau form. J.S. Bach&#x27;s utilization of rondeau includes the Passepied I from &quot;Suite No. 5 in E minor&quot; (c. 1725) in his &quot;English Suites&quot;, the fifth movement &#x27;Rondeaux&#x27; from &quot;Partita for keyboard No. 2, BWV 826&quot; (c. 1725–1727), the third movement &quot;Partita for Violin No. 3&quot; (1720), and the Rondeau from the &quot;Suite No. 2 in B minor&quot; (c. 1738–1739).

===Rondo and sonata form===
A common expansion of rondo form is to combine it with sonata form, to create the sonata rondo form. Here, the second theme acts in a similar way to the second theme group in sonata form by appearing first in a key other than the tonic and later being repeated in the tonic key. Unlike sonata form, thematic development does not need to occur except possibly in the coda.

===Examples of rondo form===
* Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Horn Concerto No. 4 in E-flat major, last movement
* Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Piano Sonata No. 11, last movement, nicknamed &quot;Rondo alla turca&quot;
* Ludwig van Beethoven: Rage Over a Lost Penny
* Ludwig van Beethoven: Rondo for piano and orchestra, WoO, 6
* Ludwig van Beethoven: Piano Sonata Op. 13, last movement
* Ludwig van Beethoven: Piano Concerto No. 5, last movement
* Antonín Dvořák: Cello Concerto in B minor, third movement
* Antonín Dvořák: Rondo for Cello and Orchestra
* Antonín Dvořák: Symphony No. 6, second movement
* Frédéric Chopin: Piano Concerto No. 1, third movement
* Aram Khachaturian: Violin Concerto, second movement
* Sergei Prokofiev: Symphony No. 5, fourth movement

==Character type==
Rondo as a character-type (as distinct from the form) refers to music that is fast and vivacious – normally &quot;Allegro&quot;. Many classical rondos feature music of a popular or folk character. Music that has been designated as &quot;rondo&quot; normally subscribes to both the form and character. On the other hand, there are many examples of slower, reflective works that are rondo in form but not in character; they include Mozart&#x27;s Rondo in A minor, K. 511 (marked &quot;Andante&quot;).

==Other usages==

A well-known operatic vocal genre of the late 18th century, referred to at that time by the same name but distinguished today in English and German writing by the differently accented term &quot;rondò&quot; is cast in two parts, slow-fast.

<text>A raga (, ; also raaga or ragam or raag; ) is a melodic framework for improvisation in Indian classical music akin to a melodic mode. &quot;Rāga&quot; is central to classical Indian music. Each &quot;rāga&quot; consists of an array of melodic structures with musical motifs; and, from the perspective of the Indian tradition, the resulting music has the ability to &quot;colour the mind&quot; as it engages the emotions of the audience.

Each &quot;rāga&quot; provides the musician with a musical framework within which to improvise. Improvisation by the musician involves creating sequences of notes allowed by the &quot;rāga&quot; in keeping with rules specific to the &quot;rāga&quot;. &quot;Rāga&quot;s range from small &quot;rāga&quot;s like Bahar and Shahana that are not much more than songs to big &quot;rāga&quot;s like Malkauns, Darbari and Yaman, which have great scope for improvisation and for which performances can last over an hour. &quot;Rāga&quot;s may change over time, with an example being Marwa, the primary development of which has been going down into the lower octave, in contrast with the traditional middle octave. Each &quot;rāga&quot; traditionally has an emotional significance and symbolic associations such as with season, time and mood. &quot;Rāgas&quot; are considered a means in the Indian musical tradition for evoking specific feelings in listeners. Hundreds of &quot;rāgas&quot; are recognized in the classical tradition, of which about 30 are common, and each &quot;rāga&quot; has its &quot;own unique melodic personality&quot;.

There are two main classical music traditions, &quot;Hindustani&quot; (North Indian) and &quot;Carnatic&quot; (South Indian), and the concept of &quot;rāga&quot; is shared by both. &quot;Rāga&quot; is also found in Sikh traditions such as in &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot;, the primary scripture of Sikhism. Similarly, it is a part of the &quot;qawwali&quot; tradition in Sufi Islamic communities of South Asia. Some popular Indian film songs and ghazals use &quot;rāgas&quot; in their composition.

Every raga has a svara (a note or named pitch) called shadja, or adhara sadja, whose pitch may be chosen arbitrarily by the performer. This is taken to mark the beginning and end of the &quot;saptak&quot; (loosely, octave). The raga also contains an adhista, which is either the svara Ma or the svara Pa. The adhista divides the octave into two parts or &quot;anga&quot; – the &quot;purvanga&quot;, which contains lower notes, and the &quot;uttaranga&quot;, which contains higher notes. Every raga has a &quot;vadi&quot; and a &quot;samvadi&quot;. The &quot;vadi&quot; is the most prominent svara, which means that an improvising musician emphasizes or pays more attention to the &quot;vadi&quot; than to other notes. The samvadi is consonant with the vadi (always from the &quot;anga&quot; that does not contain the vadi) and is the second most prominent svara in the raga.

==Terminology==
The Sanskrit word &quot;rāga&quot; (Sanskrit: ) has Indian roots, as &quot;*reg-&quot; which connotes &quot;to dye&quot;. Cognates are found in Greek, Persian, Khwarezmian and other languages, such as &quot;raxt&quot;, &quot;rang&quot;, &quot;rakt&quot; and others. The words &quot;red&quot; and &quot;rado&quot; are also related. According to Monier Monier-Williams, the term comes from a Sanskrit word for &quot;the act of colouring or dyeing&quot;, or simply a &quot;colour, hue, tint, dye&quot;. The term also connotes an emotional state referring to a &quot;feeling, affection, desire, interest, joy or delight&quot;, particularly related to passion, love, or sympathy for a subject or something. In the context of ancient Indian music, the term refers to a harmonious note, melody, formula, building block of music available to a musician to construct a state of experience in the audience.

The word appears in the ancient Principal Upanishads of Hinduism, as well as the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;. For example, verse 3.5 of the &quot;Maitri Upanishad&quot; and verse 2.2.9 of the &quot;Mundaka Upanishad&quot; contain the word &quot;rāga&quot;. The &quot;Mundaka Upanishad&quot; uses it in its discussion of soul (Atman-Brahman) and matter (Prakriti), with the sense that the soul does not &quot;colour, dye, stain, tint&quot; the matter. The &quot;Maitri Upanishad&quot; uses the term in the sense of &quot;passion, inner quality, psychological state&quot;. The term &quot;rāga&quot; is also found in ancient texts of Buddhism where it connotes &quot;passion, sensuality, lust, desire&quot; for pleasurable experiences as one of three impurities of a character. Alternatively, &quot;rāga&quot; is used in Buddhist texts in the sense of &quot;color, dye, hue&quot;.

The term &quot;rāga&quot; in the modern connotation of a melodic format occurs in the &quot;Brihaddeshi&quot; by Mataṅga Muni dated , or possibly 9th century. The &quot;Brihaddeshi&quot; describes &quot;rāga&quot; as &quot;a combination of tones which, with beautiful illuminating graces, pleases the people in general&quot;.

According to Emmie te Nijenhuis, a professor in Indian musicology, the &quot;Dattilam&quot; section of &quot;Brihaddeshi&quot; has survived into the modern times, but the details of ancient music scholars mentioned in the extant text suggest a more established tradition by the time this text was composed. The same essential idea and prototypical framework is found in ancient Hindu texts, such as the &quot;Naradiyasiksa&quot; and the classic Sanskrit work &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; by Bharata Muni, whose chronology has been estimated to sometime between 500 BCE and 500 CE, probably between 200 BCE and 200 CE.

Bharata describes a series of empirical experiments he did with the &quot;Veena&quot;, then compared what he heard, noting the relationship of fifth intervals as a function of intentionally induced change to the instrument&#x27;s tuning. Bharata states that certain combinations of notes are pleasant, and certain others are not so. His methods of experimenting with the instrument triggered further work by ancient Indian scholars, leading to the development of successive permutations, as well as theories of musical note inter-relationships, interlocking scales and how this makes the listener feel. Bharata discusses &quot;Bhairava&quot;, &quot;Kaushika&quot;, &quot;Hindola&quot;, &quot;Dipaka&quot;, &quot;SrI-rāga&quot;, and &quot;Megha&quot;. Bharata states that these can to trigger a certain affection and the ability to &quot;color the emotional state&quot; in the audience. His encyclopedic &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; links his studies on music to the performance arts, and it has been influential in Indian performance arts tradition.

The other ancient text, &quot;Naradiyasiksa&quot; dated to be from the 1st century BCE, discusses secular and religious music, compares the respective musical notes. This is earliest known text that reverentially names each musical note to be a deity, describing it in terms of &quot;varna&quot; (colours) and other motifs such as parts of fingers, an approach that is conceptually similar to the 12th century Guidonian hand in European music. The study that mathematically arranges rhythms and modes (&quot;rāga&quot;) has been called &quot;prastāra&quot; (matrix).

In the ancient texts of Hinduism, the term for the technical mode part of &quot;rāga&quot; was &quot;jati&quot;. Later, &quot;jati&quot; evolved to mean quantitative class of scales, while &quot;rāga&quot; evolved to become a more sophisticated concept that included the experience of the audience. A figurative sense of the word as &#x27;passion, love, desire, delight&#x27; is also found in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The specialized sense of &#x27;loveliness, beauty&#x27;, especially of voice or song, emerges in classical Sanskrit, used by Kalidasa and in the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;.

==History and significance==
Indian classical music has ancient roots, and developed for both spiritual (&quot;moksha&quot;) and entertainment (&quot;kama&quot;) purposes.

&quot;Rāga&quot;, along with performance arts such as dance and music, has been historically integral to Hinduism, with some Hindus believing that music is itself a spiritual pursuit and a means to moksha (liberation). &quot;Rāgas&quot;, in the Hindu tradition, are believed to have a natural existence. Artists do not invent them, they only discover them. Music appeals to human beings, according to Hinduism, because they are hidden harmonies of the ultimate creation. Some of its ancient texts such as the &quot;Sama Veda&quot; (~1000 BCE) are structured entirely to melodic themes, it is sections of &quot;Rigveda&quot; set to music. The &quot;rāgas&quot; were envisioned by the Hindus as manifestation of the divine, a musical note treated as god or goddess with complex personality.

During the Bhakti movement of Hinduism, dated to about the middle of 1st millennium CE, &quot;rāga&quot; became an integral part of a musical pursuit of spirituality. Bhajan and kirtan were composed and performed by the early South India pioneers. A &quot;bhajan&quot; has a free form devotional composition based on melodic &quot;rāgas&quot;. A &quot;Kirtan&quot; is a more structured team performance, typically with a call and response musical structure, similar to an intimate conversation. It includes two or more musical instruments, and incorporates various &quot;rāgas&quot; such as those associated with Hindu gods Shiva (&quot;Bhairav&quot;) or Krishna (&quot;Hindola&quot;).

The early 13th century Sanskrit text &quot;Sangitaratnakara&quot;, by Sarngadeva patronized by King Sighana of the Yadava dynasty in the North-Central Deccan region (today a part of Maharashtra), mentions and discusses 253 &quot;rāgas&quot;. This is one of the most complete historic treatises on the structure, technique and reasoning behind &quot;rāgas&quot; that has survived.

The tradition of incorporating &quot;rāga&quot; into spiritual music is also found in Jainism, and in Sikhism, an Indian religion founded by Guru Nanak in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent. In the Sikh scripture, the texts are attached to a &quot;rāga&quot; and are sung according to the rules of that &quot;rāga&quot;. According to Pashaura Singh – a professor of Sikh and Punjabi studies, the &quot;rāga&quot; and &quot;tala&quot; of ancient Indian traditions were carefully selected and integrated by the Sikh Gurus into their hymns. They also picked from the &quot;standard instruments used in Hindu musical traditions&quot; for singing &quot;kirtans&quot; in Sikhism.

During the Islamic rule period of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in and after the 15th century, the mystical Islamic tradition of Sufism developed devotional songs and music called &quot;qawwali&quot;. It incorporated elements of &quot;rāga&quot; and &quot;tāla&quot;.

The Buddha discouraged music aimed at entertainment to monks for higher spiritual attainment, but encouraged chanting of sacred hymns. The various canonical &quot;Tripitaka &quot; texts of Buddhism, for example, state &quot;Dasha-shila&quot; or ten precepts for those following the Buddhist monkhood. Among these is the precept recommending &quot;abstain from dancing, singing, music and worldly spectacles&quot;. Buddhism does not forbid music or dance to a Buddhist layperson, but its emphasis has been on chants, not on musical &quot;rāga&quot;.

==Description==
A &quot;rāga&quot; is sometimes explained as a melodic rule set that a musician works with, but according to Dorottya Fabian and others, this is now generally accepted among music scholars to be an explanation that is too simplistic. According to them, a &quot;rāga&quot; of the ancient Indian tradition can be compared to the concept of non-constructible set in language for human communication, in a manner described by Frederik Kortlandt and George van Driem; audiences familiar with raga recognize and evaluate performances of them intuitively.
The attempt to appreciate, understand and explain &quot;rāga&quot; among European scholars started in the early colonial period. In 1784, Jones translated it as &quot;mode&quot; of European music tradition, but Willard corrected him in 1834 with the statement that a &quot;rāga&quot; is both modet and tune. In 1933, states José Luiz Martinez – a professor of music, Stern refined this explanation to &quot;the &quot;rāga&quot; is more fixed than mode, less fixed than the melody, beyond the mode and short of melody, and richer both than a given mode or a given melody; it is mode with added multiple specialities&quot;.

A &quot;rāga&quot; is a central concept of Indian music, predominant in its expression, yet the concept has no direct Western translation. According to Walter Kaufmann, though a remarkable and prominent feature of Indian music, a definition of &quot;rāga&quot; cannot be offered in one or two sentences. &quot;rāga&quot; is a fusion of technical and ideational ideas found in music, and may be roughly described as a musical entity that includes note intonation, relative duration and order, in a manner similar to how words flexibly form phrases to create an atmosphere of expression. In some cases, certain rules are considered obligatory, in others optional. The &quot;rāga&quot; allows flexibility, where the artist may rely on simple expression, or may add ornamentations yet express the same essential message but evoke a different intensity of mood.

A &quot;rāga&quot; has a given set of notes, on a scale, ordered in melodies with musical motifs. A musician playing a &quot;rāga&quot;, states Bruno Nettl, may traditionally use just these notes but is free to emphasize or improvise certain degrees of the scale. The Indian tradition suggests a certain sequencing of how the musician moves from note to note for each &quot;rāga&quot;, in order for the performance to create a &quot;rasa&quot; (mood, atmosphere, essence, inner feeling) that is unique to each &quot;rāga&quot;. A &quot;rāga&quot; can be written on a scale. Theoretically, thousands of &quot;rāga&quot; are possible given 5 or more notes, but in practical use, the classical tradition has refined and typically relies on several hundred. For most artists, their basic perfected repertoire has some forty to fifty &quot;rāgas&quot;. &quot;Rāga&quot; in Indian classical music is intimately related to &quot;tala&quot; or guidance about &quot;division of time&quot;, with each unit called a &quot;matra&quot; (beat, and duration between beats).

A &quot;rāga&quot; is not a tune, because the same &quot;rāga&quot; can yield an infinite number of tunes. A &quot;rāga&quot; is not a scale, because many &quot;rāgas&quot; can be based on the same scale. A &quot;rāga&quot;, according to Bruno Nettl and other music scholars, is a concept similar to a mode, something between the domains of tune and scale, and it is best conceptualized as a &quot;unique array of melodic features, mapped to and organized for a unique aesthetic sentiment in the listener&quot;. The goal of a &quot;rāga&quot; and its artist is to create &quot;rasa&quot; (essence, feeling, atmosphere) with music, as classical Indian dance does with performance arts. In the Indian tradition, classical dances are performed with music set to various &quot;rāgas&quot;.

Joep Bor of the Rotterdam Conservatory of Music defined &quot;rāga&quot; as a &quot;tonal framework for composition and improvisation.&quot; Nazir Jairazbhoy, chairman of UCLA&#x27;s department of ethnomusicology, characterized rāgas as separated by scale, line of ascent and descent, , emphasized notes and register, and intonation and ornaments.

=== Rāga-Rāgini system ===
&quot;Rāginī&quot; (Devanagari: रागिनी) is a term for the &quot;feminine&quot; counterpart of a &quot;masculine&quot; rāga. These are envisioned to parallel the god-goddess themes in Hinduism, and described variously by different medieval Indian music scholars. For example, the &quot;Sangita-darpana&quot; text of 15th-century Damodara Misra proposes six &quot;rāgas&quot; with thirty &quot;ragini&quot;, creating a system of thirty six, a system that became popular in Rajasthan. In the north Himalayan regions such as Himachal Pradesh, the music scholars such as 16th century Mesakarna expanded this system to include eight descendants to each &quot;rāga&quot;, thereby creating a system of eighty four. After the 16th-century, the system expanded still further.

In &quot;Sangita-darpana&quot;, the Bhairava &quot;rāga&quot; is associated with the following raginis: Bhairavi, Punyaki, Bilawali, Aslekhi, Bangali. In the Meskarna system, the masculine and feminine musical notes are combined to produce &quot;putra rāgas&quot; called Harakh, Pancham, Disakh, Bangal, Madhu, Madhava, Lalit, Bilawal.

This system is no longer in use today because the &#x27;related&#x27; rāgas had very little or no similarity and the rāga-rāginī classification did not agree with various other schemes.

===Rāgas and their symbolism===
The North Indian &quot;rāga&quot; system is also called &quot;Hindustani&quot;, while the South Indian system is commonly referred to as &quot;Carnatic&quot;. The North Indian system suggests a particular time of a day or a season, in the belief that the human state of psyche and mind are affected by the seasons and by daily biological cycles and nature&#x27;s rhythms. The South Indian system is closer to the text, and places less emphasis on time or season.

The symbolic role of classical music through &quot;rāga&quot; has been both aesthetic indulgence and the spiritual purifying of one&#x27;s mind (yoga). The former is encouraged in Kama literature (such as &quot;Kamasutra&quot;), while the latter appears in Yoga literature with concepts such as &quot;Nada-Brahman&quot; (metaphysical Brahman of sound). &quot;Hindola rāga&quot;, for example, is considered a manifestation of Kama (god of love), typically through Krishna. &quot;Hindola&quot; is also linked to the festival of &quot;dola&quot;, which is more commonly known as &quot;spring festival of colors&quot; or Holi. This idea of aesthetic symbolism has also been expressed in Hindu temple reliefs and carvings, as well as painting collections such as the ragamala.

In ancient and medieval Indian literature, the &quot;rāga&quot; are described as manifestation and symbolism for gods and goddesses. Music is discussed as equivalent to the ritual &quot;yajna&quot; sacrifice, with pentatonic and hexatonic notes such as &quot;ni-dha-pa-ma-ga-ri&quot; as Agnistoma, &quot;&quot;ri-ni-dha-pa-ma-ga&quot; as Asvamedha, and so on.

In the Middle Ages, music scholars of India began associating each &quot;rāga&quot; with seasons. The 11th century Nanyadeva, for example, recommends that &quot;Hindola rāga&quot; is best in spring, &quot;Pancama&quot; in summer, &quot;Sadjagrama&quot; and &quot;Takka&quot; during the monsoons, &quot;Bhinnasadja&quot; is best in early winter, and &quot;Kaisika&quot; in late winter. In the 13th century, Sarngadeva went further and associated &quot;rāga&quot; with rhythms of each day and night. He associated pure and simple &quot;rāgas&quot; to early morning, mixed and more complex &quot;rāgas&quot; to late morning, skillful &quot;rāgas&quot; to noon, love-themed and passionate &quot;rāgas&quot; to evening, and universal &quot;rāgas&quot; to night.

=== Rāga and Yoga Sutras ===
In the Yoga Sutras II.7, &quot;rāga&quot; is defined as the desire for pleasure based on remembering past experiences of pleasure. Memory triggers the wish to repeat those experiences, leading to attachment. Ego is seen as the root of this attachment, and memory is necessary for attachment to form. Even when not consciously remembered, past impressions can unconsciously draw the mind toward objects of pleasure.

===Rāga and mathematics===
According to Cris Forster, mathematical studies on systematizing and analyzing South Indian &quot;rāga&quot; began in the 16th century. Computational studies of &quot;rāgas&quot; is an active area of musicology.

==Notations==
Although notes are an important part of rāga practice, they alone do not make the rāga. A rāga is more than a scale, and many rāgas share the same scale. The underlying scale may have four, five, six or seven tones, called &quot;svaras&quot;. The &quot;svara&quot; concept is found in the ancient &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; in Chapter 28. It calls the unit of tonal measurement or audible unit as &quot;Śruti&quot;, with verse 28.21 introducing the musical scale as follows,

These seven degrees are shared by both major &quot;rāga&quot; system, that is the North Indian (Hindustani) and South Indian (Carnatic). The solfege (&quot;sargam&quot;) is learnt in abbreviated form: &quot;sa, ri (Carnatic) or re (Hindustani), ga, ma, pa, dha, ni, sa&quot;. Of these, the first that is &quot;sa&quot;, and the fifth that is &quot;pa&quot;, are considered anchors that are unalterable, while the remaining have flavors that differs between the two major systems.

The music theory in the &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, states Maurice Winternitz, centers around three themes – sound, rhythm and prosody applied to musical texts. The text asserts that the octave has 22 &quot;srutis&quot; or micro-intervals of musical tones or 1200 cents. Ancient Greek system is also very close to it, states Emmie te Nijenhuis, with the difference that each &quot;sruti&quot; computes to 54.5 cents, while the Greek enharmonic quarter-tone system computes to 55 cents. The text discusses &quot;gramas&quot; (scales) and &quot;murchanas&quot; (modes), mentioning three scales of seven modes (21 total), some Greek modes are also like them . However, the Gandhara-grama is just mentioned in &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, while its discussion largely focuses on two scales, fourteen modes and eight four &quot;tanas&quot; (notes). The text also discusses which scales are best for different forms of performance arts.

These musical elements are organized into scales (&quot;mela&quot;), and the South Indian system of &quot;rāga&quot; works with 72 scales, as first discussed by &quot;Caturdandi prakashika&quot;. They are divided into two groups, &quot;purvanga&quot; and &quot;uttaranga&quot;, depending on the nature of the lower tetrachord. The &quot;anga&quot; itself has six cycles (&quot;cakra&quot;), where the &quot;purvanga&quot; or lower tetrachord is anchored, while there are six permutations of &quot;uttaranga&quot; suggested to the artist. After this system was developed, the Indian classical music scholars have developed additional &quot;rāgas&quot; for all the scales. The North Indian style is closer to the Western diatonic modes, and built upon the foundation developed by Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande using ten &quot;Thaat&quot;: &quot;kalyan, bilaval, khamaj, kafi, asavari, bhairavi, bhairav, purvi, marva and todi&quot;. Some &quot;rāgas&quot; are common to both systems and have same names, such as &quot;kalyan&quot; performed by either is recognizably the same. Some &quot;rāgas&quot; are common to both systems but have different names, such as &quot;malkos&quot; of Hindustani system is recognizably the same as &quot;hindolam&quot; of Carnatic system. However, some &quot;rāgas&quot; are named the same in the two systems, but they are different, such as &quot;todi&quot;.

Recently, a 32 thaat system was presented in a book Nai Vaigyanik Paddhati to correct the classification of ragas in North Indian style.

Rāgas that have four svaras are called &quot;&quot; (सुरतर) (tetra tonic) rāgas; those with five svaras are called &quot;audava&quot; (औडव) (pentatonic) rāgas; those with six are called &quot;shaadava&quot; (षाडव) (hex-tonic); and those with seven are called &quot;sampurna&quot; (संपूर्ण, Sanskrit for &#x27;complete&#x27;) (heptatonic). The number of svaras may differ in the ascending and descending like rāga Bhimpalasi which has five notes in the ascending and seven notes in descending or Khamaj with six notes in the ascending and seven in the descending. Rāgas differ in their ascending or descending movements. Those that do not follow the strict ascending or descending order of svaras are called &quot;vakra&quot; (वक्र) (&#x27;crooked&#x27;) rāgas.

==Carnatic rāga==

In Carnatic music, the principal rāgas are called &quot;Melakarthas&quot;, which literally means &quot;lord of the scale&quot;. It is also called &quot;Asraya rāga&quot; meaning &quot;shelter giving rāga&quot;, or &quot;Janaka rāga&quot; meaning &quot;father rāga&quot;.

A &quot;Thaata&quot; in the South Indian tradition are groups of derivative &quot;rāgas&quot;, which are called &quot;Janya rāgas&quot; meaning &quot;begotten rāgas&quot; or &quot;Asrita rāgas&quot; meaning &quot;sheltered rāgas&quot;. However, these terms are approximate and interim phrases during learning, as the relationships between the two layers are neither fixed nor has unique parent–child relationship.

Janaka rāgas are grouped together using a scheme called &quot;Katapayadi sutra&quot; and are organised as &quot;Melakarta&quot; rāgas. A Melakarta rāga is one which has all seven notes in both the ārōhanam (ascending scale) and avarōhanam (descending scale). Some &quot;Melakarta&quot; rāgas are &quot;Harikambhoji&quot;, &quot;Kalyani&quot;, &quot;Kharaharapriya&quot;, &quot;Mayamalavagowla&quot;, &quot;Sankarabharanam&quot; and &quot;Hanumatodi&quot;. Janya rāgas are derived from the Janaka rāgas using a combination of the swarams (usually a subset of swarams) from the parent rāga. Some janya rāgas are &quot;Abheri&quot;, &quot;Abhogi&quot;, &quot;Bhairavi&quot;, &quot;Hindolam&quot;, &quot;Mohanam&quot; and &quot;Kambhoji&quot;.

In this 21st century few composers have discovered new ragas. Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna who has created raga in three notes Ragas such as Mahathi, Lavangi, Sidhdhi, Sumukham that he created have only four notes,

A list of Janaka Ragas would include &quot;Kanakangi&quot;, &quot;Ratnangi&quot;, Ganamurthi, &quot;Vanaspathi&quot;, &quot;Manavathi&quot;, Thanarupi, Senavathi, &quot;Hanumatodi&quot;, &quot;Dhenuka&quot;, &quot;Natakapriya&quot;, &quot;Kokilapriya&quot;, &quot;Rupavati&quot;, &quot;Gayakapriya&quot;, &quot;Vakulabharanam&quot;, &quot;Mayamalavagowla&quot;, &quot;Chakravakam&quot;, &quot;Suryakantam&quot;, &quot;Hatakambari&quot;, &quot;Jhankaradhvani&quot;, &quot;Natabhairavi&quot;, &quot;Keeravani&quot;, &quot;Kharaharapriya&quot;, &quot;Gourimanohari&quot;, &quot;Varunapriya&quot;, &quot;Mararanjani&quot;, &quot;Charukesi&quot;, &quot;Sarasangi&quot;, &quot;Harikambhoji&quot;, &quot;Sankarabharanam&quot;, &quot;Naganandini&quot;, &quot;Yagapriya&quot;, &quot;Ragavardhini&quot;, &quot;Gangeyabhushani&quot;, &quot;Vagadheeswari&quot;, &quot;Shulini&quot;, &quot;Chalanata&quot;, &quot;Salagam&quot;, &quot;Jalarnavam&quot;, &quot;Jhalavarali&quot;, Navaneetam, &quot;Pavani&quot;.

==Training==
Classical music has been transmitted through music schools or through Guru–Shishya &quot;parampara&quot; (teacher–student tradition) through an oral tradition and practice. Some are known as &quot;gharana&quot; (houses), and their performances are staged through &quot;sabhas&quot; (music organizations). Each &quot;gharana&quot; has freely improvised over time, and differences in the rendering of each &quot;rāga&quot; is discernible. In the Indian musical schooling tradition, the small group of students lived near or with the teacher, the teacher treated them as family members providing food and boarding, and a student learnt various aspects of music thereby continuing the musical knowledge of their guru. The tradition survives in parts of India, and many musicians can trace their guru lineage.

==Persian &quot;rāk&quot;==
The music concept of &quot;rāk&quot; or &quot;rang&quot; (meaning “colour”) in Persian is probably a pronunciation of &quot;rāga&quot;. According to Hormoz Farhat, it is unclear how this term came to Persia, it has no meaning in modern Persian language, and the concept of &quot;rāga&quot; is unknown in Persia.

<text>The perennial philosophy (), also referred to as perennialism and perennial wisdom, is a school of thought in philosophy and spirituality that posits that the recurrence of common themes across world religions illuminates universal truths about the nature of reality, humanity, ethics, and consciousness. Some perennialists emphasize common themes in religious experiences and mystical traditions across time and cultures; others argue that religious traditions share a single metaphysical truth or origin from which all esoteric and exoteric knowledge and doctrine have developed.
Perennialism has its roots in the Renaissance era-interest in neo-Platonism and its idea of the One from which all existence emerges. Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) sought to integrate &quot;Hermeticism&quot; with Greek and Christian thought, discerning a &quot;prisca theologia&quot; found in all ages. Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494) suggested that truth could be found in many—rather than just two—traditions. He proposed a harmony between the thought of Plato and Aristotle and saw aspects of the &quot;prisca theologia&quot; in Averroes (Ibn Rushd), the Quran, Kabbalah, and other sources. Agostino Steuco (1497–1548) coined the term &quot;philosophia perennis&quot;.

Developments in the 19th and 20th centuries integrated Eastern religions and universalism—the idea that all religions, underneath apparent differences, point to the same Truth. In the early 19th century, the Transcendentalists propagated the idea of a metaphysical Truth and universalism—this inspired the Unitarians, who proselytized among Indian elites. Toward the end of the 19th century, the Theosophical Society further popularized universalism in the Western world and Western colonies. In the 20th century, this form of universalist perennialism was further popularized by Aldous Huxley and his book &quot;The Perennial Philosophy&quot;, which was inspired by Neo-Vedanta. Huxley and some other perennialists grounded their point of view in the commonalities of mystical experience and generally accepted religious syncretism.

Also, in the 20th century, the anti-modern Traditionalist School emerged in contrast to the universalist approach to perennialism. Inspired by Advaita Vedanta, Sufism and 20th-century works critical of modernity such as René Guénon&#x27;s &quot;The Crisis of the Modern World&quot;, Traditionalism emphasises a metaphysical unitary source of the major religions in their &quot;orthodox&quot; forms and rejects syncretism, scientism, and secularism as deviations from the truth contained in their concept of Tradition.

==Definition==
There is no universally agreed upon definition of the term &quot;perennial philosophy&quot;, and various thinkers have employed the term in different ways. For all perennialists, the term denotes a common wisdom at the heart of world religions, but exponents across time and place have differed on whether, or how, it can be defined. Some perennialists emphasise a sense of participation in an ineffable truth discovered in mystical experience, though ultimately beyond the scope of complete human understanding. Others seek a more well-developed metaphysics.

Drawing upon the same Renaissance foundations, in the 20th century the mystical universalist interpretation popularised by Aldous Huxley, and the metaphysical approach of the Traditionalist School became particularly influential.

===Renaissance===
The idea of a perennial philosophy originated with a number of Renaissance theologians who took inspiration from neo-Platonism and from the theory of Forms. Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) argued that there is an underlying unity to the world, the soul or love, which has a counterpart in the realm of ideas. According to Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494), a student of Ficino, truth could be found in many, rather than just two, traditions. According to Agostino Steuco (1497–1548) there is &quot;one principle of all things, of which there has always been one and the same knowledge among all peoples.&quot;

===Aldous Huxley and mystical universalism===
Aldous Huxley, author of the popular book &quot;The Perennial Philosophy&quot;, propagated a universalist interpretation of the world religions, inspired by Vivekananda&#x27;s neo-Vedanta and his own use of psychedelic drugs. According to Huxley:
Huxley&#x27;s approach to perennialism is grounded in ineffable mystical experience, which ego can obscure.:
In Huxley&#x27;s 1944 essay in &quot;Vedanta and the West&quot;, he proposes &quot;The Minimum Working Hypothesis&quot;, a basic outline which an individual can adopt to achieve the &quot;Godhead&quot;:

===Traditionalist School===
For the Traditionalist Seyyed Hossein Nasr, the perennial philosophy is rooted in the concept of Tradition, which he defines as:

==Origins==
The perennial philosophy originates from a blending of neo-Platonism and Christianity. Neo-Platonism itself has diverse origins in the syncretic culture of the Hellenistic period, and was an influential philosophy throughout the Middle Ages.

===Classical world===

====Hellenistic period: religious syncretism====
During the Hellenistic period, Alexander the Great&#x27;s campaigns brought about exchange of cultural ideas on its path throughout most of the known world of his era. The Greek Eleusinian Mysteries and Dionysian Mysteries mixed with such influences as the Cult of Isis, Mithraism and Hinduism, along with some Persian influences. Such cross-cultural exchange was not new to the Greeks; the Egyptian god Osiris and the Greek god Dionysus had been equated as Osiris-Dionysus by the historian Herodotus as early as the 5th century BCE (see ).

====Roman world: Philo of Alexandria====
Philo of Alexandria () attempted to reconcile Greek Rationalism with the Torah, which helped pave the way for Christianity with neoplatonism, and the adoption of the Old Testament with Christianity, as opposed to Gnostic roots of Christianity. Philo translated Judaism into terms of Stoic, Platonic and neopythagorean elements, and held that God is &quot;supra rational&quot; and can be reached only through &quot;ecstasy.&quot; He also held that the oracles of God supply the material of moral and religious knowledge.

====Neoplatonism====
Neoplatonism arose in the 3rd century CE and persisted until shortly after the closing of the Platonic Academy in Athens in 529 CE by Justinian I. Neoplatonists were heavily influenced by Plato, but also by the Platonic tradition that thrived during the six centuries which separated the first of the neoplatonists from Plato. The work of neoplatonic philosophy involved describing the derivation of the whole of reality from a single principle, &quot;the One.&quot; It was founded by Plotinus, and has been very influential throughout history. In the Middle Ages, neoplatonic ideas were integrated into the philosophical and theological works of many of the most important medieval Islamic, Christian, and Jewish thinkers.

===Renaissance===

====Ficino and Pico della Mirandola====
Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) believed that Hermes Trismegistos, the supposed author of the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot;, was a contemporary of Moses and the teacher of Pythagoras, and the source of both Greek and Christian thought. He argued that there is an underlying unity to the world, the soul or love, which has a counterpart in the realm of ideas. Platonic Philosophy and Christian theology both embody this truth. Ficino was influenced by a variety of philosophers including Aristotelian Scholasticism and various pseudonymous and mystical writings. Ficino saw his thought as part of a long development of philosophical truth, of ancient pre-Platonic philosophers (including Zoroaster, Hermes Trismegistus, Orpheus, Aglaophemus and Pythagoras) who reached their peak in Plato. The Prisca theologia, or venerable and ancient theology, which embodied the truth and could be found in all ages, was a vitally important idea for Ficino.

Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494), a student of Ficino, went further than his teacher by suggesting that truth could be found in many, rather than just two, traditions. This proposed a harmony between the thought of Plato and Aristotle, and saw aspects of the &quot;Prisca theologia&quot; in Averroes, the Koran and the Kabbalah among other sources. After the deaths of Pico and Ficino this line of thought expanded, and included Symphorien Champier, and Francesco Giorgio.

====Steuco====

=====De perenni philosophia libri X=====
The term &quot;perenni philosophia&quot; was first used by Agostino Steuco (1497–1548) who used it to title a treatise, &quot;De perenni philosophia libri X&quot;, published in 1540. &quot;De perenni philosophia&quot; was the most sustained attempt at philosophical synthesis and harmony. Steuco represents the renaissance humanist side of 16th-century Biblical scholarship and theology, although he rejected Luther and Calvin. &quot;De perenni philosophia&quot; is a complex work which only contains the term philosophia perennis twice. It states that there is &quot;one principle of all things, of which there has always been one and the same knowledge among all peoples.&quot; This single knowledge (or sapientia) is the key element in his philosophy. In that he emphasises continuity over progress, Steuco&#x27;s idea of philosophy is not one conventionally associated with the Renaissance. Indeed, he tends to believe that the truth is lost over time and is only preserved in the prisci theologica. Steuco preferred Plato to Aristotle and saw greater congruence between the former and Christianity than the latter philosopher. He held that philosophy works in harmony with religion and should lead to knowledge of God, and that truth flows from a single source, more ancient than the Greeks. Steuco was strongly influenced by Iamblichus&#x27;s statement that knowledge of God is innate in all, and also gave great importance to Hermes Trismegistus.

=====Influence=====
Steuco&#x27;s perennial philosophy was highly regarded by some scholars for the two centuries after its publication, then largely forgotten until it was rediscovered by Otto Willmann in the late part of the 19th century. Overall, &quot;De perenni philosophia&quot; was not particularly influential, and largely confined to those with a similar orientation to himself. The work was not put on the Index of works banned by the Roman Catholic Church, although his &quot;Cosmopoeia&quot; which expressed similar ideas was. Religious criticisms tended to the conservative view that held Christian teachings should be understood as unique, rather than seeing them as perfect expressions of truths that are found everywhere. More generally, this philosophical syncretism was set out at the expense of some of the doctrines included within it, and it is possible that Steuco&#x27;s critical faculties were not up to the task he had set himself. Further, placing so much confidence in the prisca theologia, turned out to be a shortcoming as many of the texts used in this school of thought later turned out to be bogus. In the following two centuries the most favourable responses were largely Protestant and often in England.

Gottfried Leibniz later picked up on Steuco&#x27;s term. The German philosopher stands in the tradition of this concordistic philosophy; his philosophy of harmony especially had affinity with Steuco&#x27;s ideas. Leibniz knew about Steuco&#x27;s work by 1687, but thought that by Huguenot philosopher Phillippe du Plessis-Mornay expressed the same truth better. Steuco&#x27;s influence can be found throughout Leibniz&#x27;s works, but the German was the first philosopher to refer to the perennial philosophy without mentioning the Italian.

==Popularisation and later developments==

===Transcendentalism and Unitarian Universalism===
Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) was a pioneer of the idea of spirituality as a distinct field. He was one of the major figures in Transcendentalism, which was rooted in English and German Romanticism, the Biblical criticism of Herder and Schleiermacher, and the skepticism of Hume. The Transcendentalists emphasised an intuitive, experiential approach of religion. Following Schleiermacher, an individual&#x27;s intuition of truth was taken as the criterion for truth. The Transcendentalists were largely inspired by Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881), whose &quot;Critical and Miscellaneous Essays&quot; popularised German Romanticism in English and whose &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; (1833–34) was a pioneer work of Western perennialism. They also read and were influenced by Hindu texts, the first translations of which appeared in the late 18th and early 19th century. They also endorsed universalist and Unitarian ideas, leading in the 20th century to Unitarian Universalism. Universalism holds the idea that there must be truth in other religions as well, since a loving God would redeem all living beings, not just Christians.

===Theosophical Society===
By the end of the 19th century, the idea of a perennial philosophy was popularized by leaders of the Theosophical Society such as H. P. Blavatsky and Annie Besant, under the name of &quot;Wisdom-Religion&quot; or &quot;Ancient Wisdom&quot;. The Theosophical Society took an active interest in Asian religions, subsequently not only bringing those religions under the attention of a western audience but also influencing Hinduism and Buddhism in Sri Lanka and Japan.

===Neo-Vedanta===
Many perennialist thinkers (including Armstrong, Gerald Heard, Aldous Huxley, Huston Smith and Joseph Campbell) are influenced by Hindu mystics Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda, who themselves have taken over western notions of universalism. They regarded Hinduism to be a token of this perennial philosophy. This notion has influenced thinkers who have proposed versions of the perennial philosophy in the 20th century.

The unity of all religions was a central impulse among Hindu reformers in the 19th century, who in turn influenced many 20th-century perennial philosophy-type thinkers. Key figures in this reforming movement included two Bengali Brahmins. Ram Mohan Roy, a philosopher and the founder of the modernising Brahmo Samaj religious organisation, reasoned that the divine was beyond description and thus that no religion could claim a monopoly in their understanding of it.

The mystic Ramakrishna&#x27;s spiritual ecstasies included experiencing his identity with Christ, Mohammed and his own Hindu deity. Ramakrishna&#x27;s most famous disciple, Swami Vivekananda, travelled to the United States in the 1890s where he formed the Vedanta Society.

Roy, Ramakrishna and Vivekananda were all influenced by the Hindu school of Advaita Vedanta, which they saw as the exemplification of a Universalist Hindu religiosity.

===Traditionalist School===
The Traditionalist School is a group of 20th- and 21st-century thinkers concerned with what they consider to be the demise of traditional forms of knowledge, both aesthetic and spiritual, within Western society. The early proponents of this school are René Guénon, Ananda Coomaraswamy and Frithjof Schuon. Other important thinkers in this tradition include Titus Burckhardt, Martin Lings, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Jean-Louis Michon, Marco Pallis, Huston Smith, Jean Borella, and Elémire Zolla. According to the Traditionalist School, orthodox religions are based on a singular metaphysical origin. According to the Traditionalist School, the &quot;philosophia perennis&quot; designates a worldview that is opposed to the scientism of modern secular societies and which promotes the rediscovery of the wisdom traditions of the pre-secular developed world. This view is exemplified by René Guénon in his 1945 book &quot;The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times&quot;, one of the founding works of the Traditionalist School.

According to Frithjof Schuon:
The Traditionalist School continues this metaphysical orientation. According to this school, the perennial philosophy is &quot;absolute Truth and infinite Presence&quot;. Absolute Truth is &quot;the perennial wisdom (&quot;sophia perennis&quot;) that stands as the transcendent source of all the intrinsically orthodox religions of humankind.&quot; Infinite Presence is &quot;the perennial religion (&quot;religio perennis&quot;) that lives within the heart of all intrinsically orthodox religions.&quot; The Traditionalist School discerns a transcendent and an immanent dimension, namely the discernment of the Real or Absolute, c.q. that which is permanent; and the intentional &quot;mystical concentration on the Real&quot;.

According to Soares de Azevedo, the perennialist philosophy states that the universal truth is the same within each of the world&#x27;s orthodox religious traditions, and is the foundation of their religious knowledge and doctrine. Each world religion is an interpretation of this universal truth, adapted to cater for the psychological, intellectual, and social needs of a given culture of a given period of history. This perennial truth has been rediscovered in each epoch by mystics of all kinds who have revived already existing religions, when they had fallen into empty platitudes and hollow ceremonialism.

Shipley further notes that the Traditionalist School is oriented on orthodox traditions, and rejects modern syncretism and universalism, which together create new religions from older religions and compromise the standing traditions.

===Aldous Huxley===
The term was popularized in the mid-twentieth century by Aldous Huxley, who was profoundly influenced by Vivekananda&#x27;s Neo-Vedanta and Universalism. In his 1945 book &quot;The Perennial Philosophy&quot; he defined the perennial philosophy as:
In contrast to the Traditionalist school, Huxley emphasized mystical experience over metaphysics:
According to Aldous Huxley, in order to apprehend the divine reality, one must choose to fulfill certain conditions: &quot;making themselves loving, pure in heart and poor in spirit.&quot; Huxley argues that very few people can achieve this state. Those who have fulfilled these conditions, grasped the universal truth and interpreted it have generally been given the name of saint, prophet, sage or enlightened one. Huxley argues that those who have, &quot;modified their merely human mode of being,&quot; and have thus been able to comprehend &quot;more than merely human kind and amount of knowledge&quot; have also achieved this enlightened state.

===New Age===
The idea of a perennial philosophy is influential in the New Age, a loosely defined Western spiritual movement that developed in the second half of the 20th century. Its central precepts have been described as &quot;drawing on both Eastern and Western spiritual and metaphysical traditions and infusing them with influences from self-help and motivational psychology, holistic health, parapsychology, consciousness research and quantum physics&quot;. The term &quot;New Age&quot; refers to the coming astrological Age of Aquarius.

The New Age aims to create &quot;a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas&quot; that is inclusive and pluralistic. It holds to &quot;a holistic worldview&quot;, emphasising that the Mind, Body and Spirit are interrelated and that there is a form of monism and unity throughout the universe. It attempts to create &quot;a worldview that includes both science and spirituality&quot; and embraces a number of forms of mainstream science as well as other forms of science that are considered fringe.

==Academic discussions==

===Mystical experience===
The idea of a perennial philosophy, sometimes called perennialism, is a key area of debate in the academic discussion of mystical experience. Huston Smith notes that the Traditionalist School&#x27;s vision of a perennial philosophy is not based on mystical experiences, but on metaphysical intuitions. The discussion of mystical experience has shifted the emphasis in the perennial philosophy from these metaphysical intuitions to religious experience and the notion of nonduality or altered state of consciousness.

William James popularized the use of the term &quot;religious experience&quot; in his 1902 book &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;. It has also influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge. Writers such as W.T. Stace, Huston Smith, and Robert Forman argue that there are core similarities to mystical experience across religions, cultures and eras. For Stace the universality of this core experience is a necessary, although not sufficient, condition for one to be able to trust the cognitive content of any religious experience.

Wayne Proudfoot traces the roots of the notion of &quot;religious experience&quot; further back to the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of &quot;religious experience&quot; was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.

Critics point out that the emphasis on &quot;experience&quot; favours the atomic individual, instead of the community. It also fails to distinguish between episodic experience, and mysticism as a process, embedded in a total religious matrix of liturgy, scripture, worship, virtues, theology, rituals and practices. Richard King also points to disjunction between &quot;mystical experience&quot; and social justice:

===Religious pluralism===
Religious pluralism holds that various world religions are limited by their distinctive historical and cultural contexts and thus there is no single, true religion. There are only many equally valid religions. Each religion is a direct result of humanity&#x27;s attempt to grasp and understand the incomprehensible divine reality. Therefore, each religion has an authentic but ultimately inadequate perception of divine reality, producing a partial understanding of the universal truth, which requires syncretism to achieve a complete understanding as well as a path towards salvation or spiritual enlightenment.

Although perennial philosophy also holds that there is no single true religion, it differs when discussing divine reality. Perennial philosophy states that a divine reality can be understood and that its existence is what allows the universal truth to be understood. Each religion provides its own interpretation of the universal truth, based on its historical and cultural context, potentially providing everything required to observe the divine reality and achieve a state in which one will be able to confirm the universal truth and achieve salvation or spiritual enlightenment.

=== Evidence for perennial philosophy ===
Cognitive archeology such as analysis of cave paintings and other pre-historic art and customs suggests that a form of perennial philosophy or Shamanic metaphysics may stretch back to the birth of behavioral modernity, all around the world. Similar beliefs are found in present-day &quot;stone age&quot; cultures such as Aboriginal Australians. Perennial philosophy postulates the existence of a spirit or concept world alongside the day-to-day world, and interactions between these worlds during dreaming and ritual, or on special days or at special places. It has been argued that perennial philosophy formed the basis for Platonism, with Plato articulating, rather than creating, much older widespread beliefs.

==Perennial trends in religions==
Perennialists often ground their position in what they call a &quot;common core&quot; of religious wisdom which is found across traditions. They argue that since many of these themes developed independent of contact between the cultures concerned, they are likely to point to deeper truths from anthropological, phenomenological and/or metaphysical perspectives. Perennialists generally make a distinction between the exoteric and esoteric dimensions of the various religions, arguing that the exoteric doctrinal differences are cultural in nature, but that the mystical traditions of these religious use the language of these doctrines and cultural forms to express identical or similar things. The perennialist rabbi Rami Shapiro expresses it from a Jewish perspective in this way:

Religions are like languages: no language is true or false; all languages are of human origin; each language reflects and shapes the civilization that speaks it; there are things you can say in one language that you cannot say or say as well in another; and the more languages you speak, the more nuanced your understanding of life becomes. Yet it is silence that reveals the ultimate Truth:

אֵ֥ין ע֖וד מִלְבַדֽו/ein od milvado

There is nothing other than God (Deut 4:35).
What follows is a summary of some of the perennialist currents which have emerged in various religions.

===Hinduism ===

Famous Hindu mystic Sri Ramakrishna stated that God can be realized through many different means and therefore all religions are true because each religion is nothing but different means towards the ultimate goal.

===Christianity===

Clement of Alexandria, who had both knowledge and admiration for Greek philosophy, thought that Greek wisdom did not contradict Christianity because it shared its source with it. According to him, philosophy is not secular knowledge but sacred knowledge derived from the reason revealed in Christ.

===Islam/Sufism===

In general, Muslims have shown a tendency towards religious exclusivism, as in other Abrahamic religions. However, there have been some exceptions to this in history. Hallaj was one of the leading Sufis with perennial perspective. Hallaj said the following about a co-religionist who insulted a Jew:

Sufi Inayat Khan, who lived in the 20th century, explained Sufism to the masses with its universal aspect and stated that it repeated the same common message with the mystical branches of other religions, and frequently made references to different religious/mystical traditions in his speeches and writings.

==Criticism==
Criticism of perennialism has come from academic and traditional religious circles. Academic critiques include the contention that perennialists make ontological claims about Divinity, God(s), and supernatural powers that cannot be verified in practice; and that they take an ahistorical or transhistorical view, overemphasizing similarities and downplaying differences between religions. Craig Martin argues that perennialism involves empirical claims, but that they circumvent those issues and make unfalsifiable claims that resemble the &quot;no true Scotsman&quot; fallacy.

Religious criticism has emerged from within various traditions, including Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. Tom Facchine argues that by prioritizing mystical experience over revelation and sacred texts, perennialists neglect, ignore, or reinterpret the truth claims found in the religious traditions they are engaged with, or that they interpret or distort the words of some religious historical figures to confirm their own views. Gary Stogsdill argues that perennialism can have negative social consequences, perceiving it as anthropocentric and individualistic, and arguing that concepts such as &quot;enlightenment&quot; can be abused by unethical gurus and teachers.

Some thinkers of the Traditionalist School have been criticised for their influence on far-right politics. Julius Evola, in particular, was active in Italian fascist politics during his lifetime and counted Benito Mussolini among his admirers. References to Evola are widespread in the alt-right movement. Steve Bannon has called him an influence.

Paul Furlong argues that &quot;Evola&#x27;s initial writings in the inter-war period were from an ideological position close to the Fascist regime in Italy, though not identical to it&quot;. Over his active years, Furlong writes, he &quot;synthesized&quot; spiritual bearings of writers like Guénon with his political concerns of the &quot;European authoritarian Right.&quot; Evola tried to develop a tradition different from that of Guénon and thus attempted to develop a &quot;strategy of active revolt as a counterpart to the spiritual withdrawal favoured by Guénon&quot;. Evola, as Furlong puts it, wanted to have political influence both in Fascist and Nazi regimes, something which he failed to achieve.

Renaud Fabbri, a Traditionalist scholar, argues that &quot;certain figures such as Mircea Eliade (1907–1986), Henry Corbin (1903–1978) and Julius Evola (1898–1974) cannot be considered as members of the Perennialist school, despite the fact that they have been influenced at some levels by Perennialism and may have used some of their ideas to support their own views.&quot; World Wisdom, a major publisher of Traditionalist literature, does not print or sell the works of these authors.

<text>The megapodes, also known as incubator birds or mound-builders, are stocky, medium-large, chicken-like birds with small heads and large feet in the family Megapodiidae. Their name literally means &quot;large foot&quot; and is a reference to the heavy legs and feet typical of these terrestrial birds. All are browsers, and all except the malleefowl occupy wooded habitats. Most are brown or black in color. Megapodes are superprecocial, hatching from their eggs in the most mature condition of any bird. They hatch with open eyes, bodily coordination and strength, full wing feathers, and downy body feathers, and are able to run, pursue prey and, in some species, fly on the day they hatch.

==Etymology==
From the Greek ( = &quot;great&quot;) and , ( = &quot;foot&quot;).

==Description==
Megapodes are medium-sized to large terrestrial birds with large legs and feet with sharp claws. Megapodes are of three kinds: scrub fowl, brush turkeys, and mallee fowl or lowan. The largest members of the clade are the species of &quot;Alectura&quot; and &quot;Talegalla&quot;. The smallest are the Micronesian scrubfowl (&quot;Megapodius laperouse&quot;) and the Moluccan scrubfowl (&quot;Eulipoa wallacei&quot;). They have small heads, short beaks, and rounded and large wings. Their flying abilities vary within the clade. They present the hallux at the same level of the other toes just like the species of the clade Cracidae. The other Galliformes have their halluces raised above the level of the front toes.

== Distribution and habitat==
Megapodes are found in the broader Australasian region, including islands in the western Pacific, Australia, New Guinea, and the islands of Indonesia east of the Wallace Line, but also the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. The distribution of the family has contracted in the Pacific with the arrival of humans, and a number of island groups such as Fiji, Tonga, and New Caledonia have lost many or all of their species. Raoul Island, a New Zealand territory and the main island of the Kermadec Islands, may also have once had a species of megapode, based on settler accounts.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Megapodes are mainly solitary birds that do not incubate their eggs with their body heat as other birds do, but bury them. Their eggs are unusual in having a large yolk, making up 50–70% of the egg weight. The birds are best known for building massive nest mounds of decaying vegetation, which the male attends, adding or removing litter to regulate the internal heat while the eggs develop. However, some bury their eggs in other ways; there are burrow-nesters which use geothermal heat, and others which simply rely on the heat of the sun warming the sand. Some species vary their incubation strategy depending on the local environment. 

Although the Australian brushturkey was thought to exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, this was later proven false; temperature does, however, affect embryo mortality and resulting offspring sex ratios. The nonsocial nature of their incubation raises questions as to how the hatchlings come to recognise other members of their species, which is due to imprinting in other members of the order Galliformes. Research suggests an instinctive visual recognition of specific movement patterns is made by the individual species of megapode.
Megapode chicks do not have an egg tooth; they use their powerful claws to break out of the egg, and then tunnel their way up to the surface of the mound, lying on their backs and scratching at the sand and vegetable matter. Similar to other superprecocial birds, they hatch fully feathered and active, already able to fly and live independently from their parents. In megapodes superprecociality apparently evolved secondarily from brooding and at least loose parental care as more typical in Galliformes.
Eggs previously assigned to &quot;Genyornis&quot; have been reassigned to giant megapode species. Some dietary and chronological data previously assigned to dromornithids may instead be assigned to the giant megapodes.

Megapodes share some similarities to the extinct enantiornithes in terms of their superprecocial life cycle, though also several differences.

==Species==
The more than 20 living species are placed in seven genera. Although the evolutionary relationships between the Megapodiidae are especially uncertain, the morphological groups are clear:

<text>Khama III (c. 1837 – 21 February, 1923), referred to by missionaries as Khama the Good also called Khama the Great, was the &quot;Kgosi&quot; (meaning king) of the Bangwato people.

==Ancestry and Youth==
Malope, a chief of the Bakwena, led his people from the Transvaal region of South Africa into the southeast territory of Botswana. Malope had three sons – Kwena, Ngwato, and Ngwaketse – each of whom would eventually break away from their father (as well as from each other) and form new communities in neighboring territories. This type of familial break between father and sons (and then between sons) was historically how ethnic communities proliferated throughout the southern African region.

In this particular instance, the break between Malope and sons was precipitated by a series of events – the death of Malope, Kwena&#x27;s subsequent assumption of the Bakwena chieftainship, and ultimately a dispute between Kwena and Ngwato over a lost cow. Shortly after the lost-cow incident, Ngwato and his followers secretly left Kwena&#x27;s village under the cover of darkness and established a new village to the north. Ngwaketse similarly moved south.

Kwena warriors attacked Ngwato&#x27;s village three times, each time pushing Ngwato and his followers (now known as the Bamangwato) further northward. Somehow (this episode is not explained by Bessie), they held on, and by the time of Chief Khama III&#x27;s reign (between the years 1875–1923), the Bamangwato had grown (both through natural population increase and the influx of refugees from South Africa and Rhodesia) to become the region&#x27;s largest ethnic community. 

==Baptism and conflict with Sekgoma==

Following the opening up of the Kalahari by David Livingstone in 1849, a large hunting-trading boom arose that lasted into the late 1870s. This trade was controlled by the Bakwena, Bangwato, Bangwaketse, and Batawana, who were all part of a loose alliance. All four of these Tswana-speaking groups organized private and regimental hunting groups using horses and guns, in addition to the forced labor of desert-dwellers whom they subjugated or forced to pay annual tribute in the form of hunting products. The young Khama was at the forefront of this transition to global commerce, and as a young man owned considerable numbers of horses, guns, and ox-wagons. He was well-travelled and spoke fluent Dutch, the lingua franca of the period. By all accounts he was popular with visiting hunters (who came from South Africa and across the globe), who needed permission to travel and hunt on Ngwato territory. Although he was often portrayed by his missionary patrons as being primarily motivated by religious concerns, Khama was at the center of not only reshaping the Ngwato economy, but also of extending its power over a host of subject peoples.

Despite his considerable influence as an economic actor, Khama is best known as the founder of a Christian state. In his early twenties, Khama was baptized into the Lutheran church in 1860 by the German missionary Heinrich Christoph Schulenberg along with five of his younger brothers. The brothers were some of the first members of the tribe to take this step; a step that would soon be joined by a fairly large percentage of Khama&#x27;s followers. It was no small step for Khama. By this time in his life he had already gone through bogwera (the tribe&#x27;s traditional initiation ceremony into manhood) with members of his mephato (age regiment). Historically, bogwera entailed rigorous endurance tests, which included circumcision.
Initially, Khama&#x27;s father, Chief Sekgoma I, grudgingly accepted his son&#x27;s affiliation with the church, although he did not embrace church doctrine himself, seeing it as an inherently colonial religion that stood against the values, beliefs, and practices of the Bangwato. Eventually their divergent beliefs and values brought Sekgoma and Khama into open conflict. At the time, the tribe was based in the village of Shoshong, which is located near present-day Mahalapye.

The conflict included its share of intrigue – an attempted assassination (of Khama by Sekgoma), Khama&#x27;s marriage in 1862 to a Christian woman named Mma Bessie and his subsequent refusal to take a second wife according to the custom of polygamy, Khama&#x27;s withstanding of Sekgoma&#x27;s sorcery, Khama&#x27;s forced exile with the tribe&#x27;s Christian followers into the hills surrounding the village of Shoshong, and finally Khama&#x27;s return to Shoshong after Sekgoma&#x27;s second botched assassination attempt and the concomitant installing of Sekgoma&#x27;s brother, Macheng, as the new chief of the beleaguered tribe (Sekgoma headed into exile).

It was not long before Macheng and Khama clashed as well, leading Macheng to attempt his own assassination of Khama, which likewise failed miserably. Khama then ousted Macheng and, in what was either a selfless gesture of goodwill or simply a dogged adherence to tribal custom, re-installed his father, Sekgoma, as Chief of the Bamangwato. Unfortunately, the truce between father and son would again falter after a few short months.

This time Khama and his followers, who now represented the majority of the tribe in Shoshong, relocated northward to the tiny village of Serowe and prepared for war with Sekgoma. The war lasted one month, culminating in Sekgoma&#x27;s defeat and Khama&#x27;s ascension of the Kingship. Khama was now free to leave his mark on the history of the tribe.

==Kingship==
Khama is probably best remembered for having made three crucial decisions during his tenure as King. First, although he abolished the bogwera ceremony itself, Khama retained the mephato regiments as a source of free labor for a variety of economic and religious purposes. The scope of a mephato&#x27;s work responsibilities would later expand considerably under the rule of Khama&#x27;s son Tshekedi into the building of primary schools, grain silos, water reticulation systems, and even a college named Moeng located on the outskirts of Serowe, which under Khama&#x27;s reign had become the Bamangwato capital. In concert with the mephato, Khama introduced a host of European technological improvements in Bamangwato territory, including the mogoma, or oxen-drawn moldboard plow (in place of the hand hoe) and wagons for transport (in place of sledges).

Bangwato men and women were required to participate in assigned work projects when their regiments were called to service. Such mephato were literally called upon: an appointed person from the village would climb to the top of Serowe Hill and literally yell out the name of the mephato that was scheduled to begin work. All members of the mephato would drop whatever they were doing and begin their six-month tour of duty, without any material support from the village (in particular without any organized contribution of food). The mephato was generally expected to fend for itself during its work assignment.

After Khama became kgosi (king) in 1875, after overthrowing his father Sekgoma and elbowing away his brother Kgamane his ascension came at a time of great dangers and opportunities. Ndebele incursions from the north (from what is now Zimbabwe), Boer and &quot;mixed&quot; trekkers from the south, and German forces from the West, all hoping to the seize his territory and its hinterlands. He answered these challenges by aligning his state with the administrative aims of the British, which provided him with cover and support, and, relatedly, by energetically expanding his own control over a much wider area than any kgosi before him. Converting to Christianity moved him to criminalize sectarianism and to deprecate the institutions favored by traditionalists. At Khama&#x27;s request stringent laws were passed against the importation of alcohol. To enforce the alcohol ban whites were banished from his kingdom.

The British government itself was of two minds as to what to do with the territory. One faction, supported by a local missionary named John Mackenzie, advocated the establishment of a protectorate, while another faction, headed by Cecil Rhodes, adopted a more assertive stance and demanded that the country be opened up to European settlement and economic exploitation. The resolution came in 1885, when the territory south of the Molopo River became the colony of British Bechuanaland, while the territory north of the river became the Bechuanaland Protectorate. The colony was eventually incorporated into Britain&#x27;s Cape Colony and is now part of South Africa.

Rhodes continued his campaign to pressure his government to annex what remained of Khama&#x27;s territory. In 1895, with two other chiefs from neighboring tribes, Bathoen I and Sebele I, Khama traveled to Britain to lobby the Queen for protection from the dual pressures of Cecil Rhodes&#x27; British South Africa Company – located in what was later to become Rhodesia to the north – and the Afrikaner settlers creeping up from the south. Because the trip was missionary-organized, Khama&#x27;s Christianity was made the centerpiece of the campaign. The Chiefs traveled widely across Britain speaking to large evangelical audiences. Not only was Khama&#x27;s biography written at this time, but he received large amounts of other press that cemented his legend as an African Christian. The journey to Britain by the three Tswana kings eventually proved successful following the ill-fated Jameson Raid of 1896, when Rhodes&#x27; reputation was ruined. Had Khama and his compatriots been unable to convince the British authorities of the need to protect the Bamangwato prior to the Jameson Raid fiasco, it is very likely that much of what is today Botswana would have been absorbed into Rhodesia and South Africa.

Khama III was steadfast in imposing his Christianized will on the tribe. He promoted schools and gave preference to hiring educated Christians. He banned alcohol from tribal lands (with varying success), put moratoriums on the sale of cattle outside the Bamangwato territory and tribal land as concessions to foreign mining and cattle interests, and abolished polygamy. The abolishment of polygamy was perhaps his most controversial move. Some argue that as Christianity later spread among the other tribes of the protectorate and polygamy was universally abolished, the societal &#x27;glue&#x27; that kept families together (extended as they were through polygamy) dried up.

==Legacy==

Khama&#x27;s eldest son from his marriage with Mma Bessie was named Sekgoma II, who became King of the Bamangwato upon Khama&#x27;s death in 1923. Sekgoma II&#x27;s eldest son was named Seretse. Throughout his life Khama took several wives (each after the death of the former one). One of his wives, Semane, gave birth to a son named Tshekedi.

Sekgoma II&#x27;s reign lasted only a year or so, leaving his son Seretse, who at the time was an infant, as the rightful heir to the chieftainship (Tshekedi was not in line to be chief since he did not descend from Khama&#x27;s oldest son Sekgoma II). So in keeping with tradition, Tshekedi acted as regent of the tribe until Seretse was old enough to assume the chieftainship. The transfer of responsibility from Tshekedi to Seretse was planned to occur after Seretse had returned from his law studies overseas in Britain.

Tshekedi Khama&#x27;s regency as acting chief of the Bamangwato is best remembered for his expansion of the mephato regiments for the building of primary schools, grain silos, and water reticulation systems; for his frequent interest in the administration of justice in Ngwato country; and for his efforts to deal with a major split in the tribe after Seretse married a white woman, Ruth Williams, while studying law in Britain.

Tshekedi opposed the marriage on the grounds that under Tswana custom a chief could not marry simply as he pleased. He was a servant of the people; the chieftaincy itself was at stake. Seretse would not budge in his desire to marry Ruth (which he did while exiled in Britain in 1948), and tribal opinion about the marriage basically split evenly along demographic lines – older people went with Tshekedi, the younger with Seretse. In the end, the decision was made by the colonial authorities to exile both men (Tshekedi from the Bamangwato territory, Seretse from the Protectorate altogether). Rioting broke out afterwards.

Eventually, once emotions had had enough time to subside, Seretse and Ruth were allowed to return to the Protectorate and Seretse and Tshekedi were able to patch things up a bit between themselves. By now though, Seretse saw his destiny not as chief of the Bamangwato tribe, but rather as leader of the Botswana Democratic Party and as President of the soon-to-be independent nation of Botswana in 1966. He would remain Botswana&#x27;s President until his death from pancreatic cancer in 1980.

The Three Dikgosi Monument features Khama III along with two other kgosi for their work in establishing Botswana&#x27;s independence.

==Current descendants==
The Bechuanaland Protectorate maintained its semi-independent status until 1966, when it gained full independence as the Republic of Botswana. The first president, Sir Seretse Khama, was the grandson and heir of Khama III and his first son from Ruth Khama, Seretse Khama Ian Khama, would succeed Seretse Khama as the paramount chief of the Bamangwato and go on to become the commander of the Botswana Defence Force, as a lieutenant general. On April 1, 2008, Seretse Khama Ian Khama, son of Sir Seretse Khama, and former Vice-President of Botswana, was sworn in as the fourth President of Botswana. Tshekedi Khama II, the brother of Seretse Khama Ian Khama, had also entered the political fray by taking over the parliamentary seat of his brother in Serowe. Ndelu Seretse, a cousin of President Seretse Khama Ian Khama, is a former Minister of Justice, Defense and Security in the Government of Botswana. Sheila Khama, a distant relative of Seretse Khama Ian Khama, is the former CEO of De Beers Botswana, the largest mining company in Botswana, and part of the largest mineral mining company in the world. President Seretse Khama Ian Khama was elected for a full term as President of Botswana on October 16, 2009 and stepped down in 2018. Hence, the &quot;House of Khama&quot; is still prominent in Botswana society. In the neighboring country of South Africa, Queen Semane Khama Molotlegi, Queen Mother of the Royal Bafokeng Nation, is the granddaughter of Khama III. The 36th kgosi of the Royal Bafokeng Nation, Kgosi (King) Leruo Molotlegi, is the eldest living son of Queen Mother Semane Molotlegi and is therefore a great-grandson of Khama III.

<text>Antoine-Léonard de Chézy (15 January 177331 August 1832) was a French orientalist and one of the first European scholars of Sanskrit. 
==Biography==
He was born at Neuilly. His father, Antoine de Chézy (1718–1798), was an engineer who finally became director of the École des Ponts et Chaussées. The son was intended for his father&#x27;s profession; but in 1799 he obtained a post in the oriental manuscripts department of the national library. In about 1803, he began studying Sanskrit, and although he possessed no grammar or dictionary, he succeeded in acquiring sufficient knowledge of the language to be able to compose poetry in it.

In Paris sometime between 1800 and 1805, Friedrich Schlegel&#x27;s wife Dorothea introduced him to the Wilhelmine Christiane von Klencke, called Hermina or Hermine, who, extremely unusually for the time, was a very young divorcée who had come to Paris to be a correspondent for German newspapers. In 1805 they married and Helmina subsequently gave birth to two sons: the author Wilhelm Theodor von Chézy (1806–1865) and Max von Chézy (1808–1846), who became a painter. However, the marriage was ultimately not a success, and the couple parted, although did not divorce, in 1810. De Chézy continued to make annual payments for her support until his death. 

He was the first professor of Sanskrit appointed in the Collège de France (1815), where his pupils included Alexandre Langlois, Auguste-Louis-Armand Loiseleur-Deslongchamps and especially Eugène Burnouf, who would become his successor at the Collège on his death in 1832. 

He was a chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, and a member of the Académie des Inscriptions. Among his works were:
*&quot;Medjnoun et Leïla&quot; (1807), from the Persian.
*&quot;Yadjnadatta-badha ou la mort d&#x27;Yadjnadatta&quot; (1814).
*&quot;La Reconnaissance de Sacountala&quot; (1830), from the Sanskrit.
*&quot;Anthologie érotique d&#x27;Amarou&quot; (1831), published under the pseudonym A. L. Apudy.

<doc id="200353" wikidata="Q62128" url="?curid=200353" title="Khyal">
<text>Khyal or Khayal (ख़याल / خیال) is a major form of Hindustani classical music in the Indian subcontinent. Its name comes from a Persian/Arabic word meaning &quot;imagination&quot;. Khyal is associated with romantic poetry, and allows the performer greater freedom of expression than dhrupad and is sung with the tabla instead of the pakhavaj. In khyal, ragas are extensively ornamented, and the style calls for more technical virtuosity.

== Etymology ==
 () is an Urdu word of Arabic origin which means &quot;imagination, thought, ideation, meditation, reflection&quot;. Hence khyal connotes the idea of a song that is imaginative and creative in either its nature or execution. The word entered India through the medium of the Persian language. Just as the word reflects ideas of imagination and imaginative composition, the musical form is imaginative in conception, artistic and decorative in execution and romantic in appeal.

== Characteristics ==
There are three main characteristics of khyal: various musical materials that can be employed, the selection of different types of improvisation, and the placement of various materials in order to produce a balanced and aesthetically pleasing performance.

=== Musical Materials ===

==== Raga ====
 is a melodic framework for improvisation based on the idea that certain characteristic patterns of notes () evoke a heightened state of emotion. These patterns of notes are a fusion of scalar and melodic elements, and each raga can be described in terms of its ascending lines () and descending lines (), as well in terms of its characteristic melodic figures in which certain intervals are emphasised and attention is focused on particular notes.

Khyal can be played in hundreds of ragas and there are few conceptual limitations when it comes to selection. Instead such decisions are made on the basis of artistic preference, vocal quality, the nature of the composition and time of the day of the performance. Some khyal singers maintain a large anthology of ragas while others prefer to focus their attention on a smaller selection. Those with high pitched voices often prefer ragas in the upper register while those with heavy vocal quality can choose ragas that are deep and ponderous in nature. Similarly artists that are adept in intonation can cultivate ragas which has melodic skips and those who enjoy intellectual and musical challenges might choose ragas of a complex nature.

==== Tala ====
The term , which is perhaps best translated as &#x27;time measure&#x27;, covers the whole subject of musical meter in Indian classical music. A tala is a metrical framework, or structure of beats (), within which musical compositions are composed and performed. They can be performed in different tempi - slow (), medium () and fast ().

Khyal is usually performed in seven talas, which are , , , , , &quot;Tintāl&quot; and &quot;Aḍacautāl&quot;. Tilwada, Jhumra and Rupak are generally used for vilambit performance although composers who use tilwada are relatively few. Ektal was traditionally used for vilambit and madhya performances, but it is also used for drut performances. Jhaptal is used for madhya performances. Adacautal is used for both slow and fast performances, but rarely encountered. Tintal was conventionally associated with drut performances, especially those that emphasize rhythmic play. It is now used for playing performances in all three tempi.

==== Bandish ====

Khyal bases itself on a repertoire of short songs (two to eight lines); a khyal song is called a . Every singer generally renders the same bandish differently, with only the text and the raga remaining the same. Khyal bandishes are typically composed in a variant of Hindi-Urdu or occasionally the Dari variant of the Persian language, Bhojpuri, Rajasthani, or Marathi. These compositions cover diverse topics, such as romantic or divine love, praise of kings or gods, the seasons, dawn and dusk, and the pranks of Krishna, and they can have symbolism and imagery. The Rajasthani or Marwari khyals were usually written down in the Dingal language.

A bandish is divided into two parts, the  and the  (if there are three sections, the third will be considered as an additional antara verse). These sections can be characterised in terms of three pitch registers, low middle and high. The sthayi section is composed in the low register and bottom of the middle half register, while the antara section is composed in the upper middle register and high registers. The sthayi section is considered more important because it shows the pitch selection and melodic contours of the raga, while antara section is more textually dense.

=== Types of Improvisation ===

==== Alap ====
 is a form of improvisation that is used to introduce the characteristics of a raga in a gradual and systematic fashion. It can be sung to vocables in free form, in which case it is known as . It can also be sung to the text of the bandish in metrical form, in which case it is called or ( is a Sanskrit word which means &#x27;composition&#x27;). The degree of rhythm that is introduced to the alap by the bandish also varies from singer to singer. There are various styles of presenting a raga, such as (combination of various pitches manner) and (pitch-by-pitch manner). The pacing and divisions of alap can also vary, some artists spend more time in a certain pitch register than others.

==== Tans ====
 are fast melodic figures of a virtuosic nature, sung to a vowel - usually &#x27;ā&#x27; (which is called ). They can vary in shape, range, presence of ornamentation, speed, etc. The concept of tans is elusive and difficult to define. Some singers are well known for singing tans, especially tans of shape such as &#x27;roller-coaster&#x27; and &#x27;plateau&#x27;, while others use only a few in their performances. Tans can be sung in different sections, or they can be ornamented to the point that the different pitches are indistinguishable.

When tans are sung to syllables of the bandish text they are known as boltans. They provide a textual element to improvisation in khyal. The bols in bolton are supposed to be spaced in a scattering of tans so that the meaning of the text can be properly understood. They can be described as being melismatic and contrasted with the long and stretched form of akars. They can be used to create rhythmic interest or they can be indistinguishable to akars.

==== Bolbant ====
 refers to the use of the bandish text (bols) for the purpose of rhythmic play. It is used by musicians who excel in the control of tala. Some artists create passages of bolbans with rhythmic placement of the straight lines of the bandish text while others recombine the text words and phrases for variety. Many artists use simple syncopation patterns while others use more audacious patterns such as layakari. The rhythmic variety in bolbant is essentially unlimited.

==== Sargam ====
 passages are those enunciating the syllables for the pitches (Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni) as they are sung. Most artists use them for speed, in the manner of tans, but with manifestation of mathematically proportioned rhythmic densities relative to the speed of the tala counts (double speed, quadruple speed, etc) than a &#x27;flowing&#x27; tan is likely to give. Another option is to use sargam in bolbant-like improvisation, and a few khyal singers bring the text syllables into play.

==== Nom-tom ====
 features rhythmic pulsations, achieved by pitch repetition, particular ornamentation, and enunciation of text syllables, vocables, or vowels. It is only used by a limited number of artists since it is associated more often with dhrupad than with khyal. In dhrupad, it is sung as part of the unmetered ragalap which is presented before the composition is performed, and it is sung to vocables. In khyal, it is sung before or after the composition is presented, and it can be sung to either vocables or syllables of the bandish text. Its features complement the rippling effects of tans and the lyrical element of alap while avoiding the rhythmic complexity of boltans.

=== Placement of various materials ===
A typical khyal performance uses two bandish compositions — the (great khyal) constitutes most of the performance, while the (small khyal) is used as a finale and is usually in the same raga but a different tala. The bada khyal covers a wide range of possibilities, ideally giving attention to all musical elements - melody, rhythm and speed. In the chota khyal, melody is accomplished through the bandish while rhythm and speed is emphasised through improvisation. Another difference is one of speed, the bada khyal begins at a slow speed (vilambit laya) or medium speed (madhya laya), while the chota khyal begins at a fast speed (drut laya). In each of these two songs, the rate of the tala counts gradually increases during the course of their performance. 

The main portion of the khyal performance is often preceded by some kind of melodic improvisation which widely varies due to artistic preference. Some artists begin their performance by singing to a small number of vocables, such as &#x27;de&#x27;, &#x27;ne&#x27;, or &#x27;na&#x27;, or to vowels (usually &#x27;a&#x27;), or to the words of the bandish text. For some, this section acts as a kind of vocal warm-up, taking up only a few seconds. Others use it in order to set the mood, singing for a minute or two, with the effect of beginning a ragalap, or singing a kind of &#x27;mini-ragalap&#x27;, or possibly foreshadowing the bandish that comes next. Meanwhile, some singers make it a major structural portion of their bada khyal and surround it ragalap before and rupakalapti after. 

The first phrase () of the sthayi is the most important component of the bandish because it provides material for most cadences in the performance. Some artists present the antara gradually by creating a cadence or two in the process while the first phrase of the antara (antara mukhda) provides material for the cadence. The mukhda can be performed as an element of rhythm, or it can be blended into the alap-oriented structure of the slow bada khyal. The melody of the mukhda generally undergoes a great deal of change during improvisation. The bandish is usually sung with its sections (sthayi and antara) separated in some way. In the bada khyal, especially at a slow speed, artists usually sing the sthayi only at the beginning, after which the sthayi text (or the vocables or the vowels) are augmented with new melody. Most artists begin singing the antara some point when the high pitch register is reached. Meanwhile, other artists prefer to skip the antara section, thereby reducing the textual density of the bada khyal, and instead sing the sthayi text in an antara-like melody. Some artists sing both the sthayi and the antara are the beginning of the bada khyal, this is particularly common in medium speed bada khyal performances. They often use some kind of improvisation to separate the sthayi from the antara, or they might use a different arrangement.

== Ensemble ==

The basic ensemble of a khyal performance consists of the featured soloist(s), an accompanist (or two) on a melody-producing instrument, a tabla player, and one or two accompanists on the tanpura, the drone-producing instrument. A possible addition to the basic ensemble is a supporting singer (or two). This is a traditional part of training for young aspiring artists whose task is to begin improvising when the soloist wishes to rest, or when the soloist asks the supporting singer to repeat a passage after him (for example, a tan repeated in sargam). The supporting singer can also be assigned to play the tanpura. 

Khyal is usually sung as a solo, but in some cases there are two soloists who perform together by dividing the improvisation between them so that there is still only one vocal part, this is known as jugalbandi. The jugalbandi form of khyal is cooperative, as opposed to competitive, and it requires a considerable amount of skill and intimacy to create a performance in which both soloists contribute equally. 

The melody producing instrument in a khyal performance can either be a sarangi (a bowed string instrument) or a harmonium (a portable organ). The role of the artist is to complement the vocal line of the soloist, by playing in heterophony a split second behind as the soloist improvises, by repeating ends of phrases for continuity when the soloist takes a short break, or by repeating earlier phrases during longer breaks. In some cases, the soloist and the sarangi player can form a partnership, in which case the sarangi player can be asked to improvise rather than just repeat during vocal breaks, or they can be asked to perform a challenging feat such repeating a phrase such as a tan. The other major instrument used in a khyal performance is the tabla, which is a percussion instrument. The tabla player is essentially the time keeper for the performance, and it is their task to play the various drum patterns associated with a particular tala.

== History ==

=== Development of Khyal ===

Music in the Indian subcontinent was traditionally divided into two categories, and . Gandharva was an ancient form of music which was traditionally handed down from master to pupil while Prabhanda, also known as or , consisted of regional songs or tunes. Prabhanda was a systematic and organised form of music that consisted of four sections, (later known as ), , and , and numerous musical elements such as , , , , and . There were several musical compositions such as , , , , and . Sadharani was an eclectic style of composition that incorporated elements of other styles, particularly bhinna, and incorporated sweet idioms and delicate nuances of emotion. Rupakalapti was a creative and imaginative style of composition which consisted of  (musical improvisation), raga and tala, incorporated inside of a prabhanda. 

The Ghaznavid conquest of northern India resulted in the introduction of the Persian language and culture into the Indian subcontinent. The Ghaznavids were Turks based in Ghazni (in present day Afghanistan) and they were the political heirs of the Persian Samanid dynasty based in Bukhara (in present day Uzbekistan). When Delhi became the capitol of the new rulers, it inherited many of the cultural institutions and literary practices of the Ghaznavids, causing a new literary florescence. The Mongol invasions caused many poets to seek refuge and find patronage at the royal court of Delhi. The first generation of Persian poets, such as Abu al-Faraj Runi and Mas&#x27;ud Sa&#x27;d Salman, continued the literary traditions of the Samanids. Amir Khusrau (1253 - 1325) was a poet and composer who lived during this period. He was born in North India but raised in a Turco-Iranian environment. He served in the courts of various sultans and princes belonging to the Mamluk, Khalji and Tughlaq dynasties, and remained attached to the Chisti suffis of Delhi. It has often been speculated that khyal was created by Amir Khusrau, but the evidence for this is insufficient. Most scholars agree that khyal was the outcome of a gradual process of evolution that occurred in the Delhi Sultanate. It developed upon the ancient structure of sadharani composition and its creative and imaginative style was based on the rupakalapti form of composition. The Sharqui rulers of Jaunpur were great patrons of fine art such as architecture, painting and music. They patronised khyal to a great extent in the 14th and 15th centuries.

Medieval India also witnessed the emergence of different schools of classical music known as gharanas. The term gharana carries multiple and diverse connotations, but the concept can be said to include a lineage of hereditary musicians, their disciples and the different musical style they represent. In the case of khyal, a gharana may consist of a single lineage or several lineages of hereditary musicians. In the case of the Gwalior gharana, the oldest of the khyal gharanas, the lineage of hereditary musicians who were the founding family of the khyal style is extinct; a different family of hereditary musicians who were trained into the tradition by the founding family carries on the tradition.

=== Mughal Period ===

During the reign of the Mughal emperor Akbar, khyal was nurtured by eminent musicians, and many master musicians, such as Suraj Khan, Chand Khan, Baz Bahadur and Rupamati, were interested in the culture of khyal, though it did not enjoy royal patronage like dhrupad. As a result, it remained outside the pale of royal courts and aristocratic societies of the time. A list of musicians at the court of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan included in Raga Darpan, a book written by Faqir Ullah, one-time governor of Kashmir, mention two khyal performers.

Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah was another great patron of music, poetry and painting, which he continued even after the invasion of India by Persian emperor Nadir Shah. One of his musicians, Niyamat Khan, who was adept in both dhrupad and veena, won the title Sadarang from the emperor for his talents and theoretical and practical knowledge in classical music. He created the elegant classical form of khyal in a majestic and colourful slow tempo (vilambita laya) like dhrupad. Sadarang heightened the classical form of khyal such that it was appreciated by the top-ranking musicians and royal sovereigns of the time. As a result, khyal attained a similar high position to that enjoyed by dhrupad, and gradually came to be developed with many modifications and changes in forms and styles and decorative elements.

=== Colonial period ===
The decline of the Mughal empire and the British colonisation of the Indian subcontinent had a detrimental effect on the quality and quantity of khyal music as it did not get any special patronage from the British colonial government in India. As a result, its patronage was more or less confined to the courts of certain maharajas, rajas and nawabs who provided employment for numerous artists. Meanwhile, others preferred (or could only afford) to maintain a few artists or to invite artists to visit on a temporary basis. Some patrons, such as the Gaekwads of Baroda, employed khyal players from more than one gharana; as a result, Baroda is associated with many different styles of performance. Others, such as the rulers of Gwalior and Rampur, preferred to patronize consistently and primarily musicians of one gharana, so that those courts are associated with a single style of performance. In the nineteenth century, a large number of wealthy urban citizens became patrons of Indian classical music. By the early twentieth century, some khyal players were leading efforts to introduce classical music to the general public, which helped in broadening the patronage base.

During this period, particularly the early twentieth, two major ideas emerged about the study and transmission of Indian classical music. The first had to do with the growing demand for institutional teaching, which led to a rising number of music schools being established though patronage by native princes and urban elites. The other was concerned with systematisation and generalisation of the Indian classical music. The Indian musicologist Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande played a major part in systematising the tradition while also opening it up for the general audience. He wrote the first modern treatise on Hindustani classical music, introduced the Thaat system for classifying ragas, published a series of textbooks, and initiated a number of conferences to provide a common platform for discussion between Hindustani and Carnatic classical musicians.

=== Post-Independence period ===

In 1947, British rule in the Indian subcontinent came to an end, and two new nations came into existence, India and Pakistan. The princely states that had been part of the British Raj were incorporated into the two new nation states. This led to a radical change as patronage shifted from the hundred of princely courts to the Government of India. As part of the post-independence project of nation building, the cultural domain was developed by the establishment of bodies such as Sangeet Natak Akademi (inaugurated in 1953), the state-owned All India Radio and, later, the national television broadcaster, Doordarshan. Such agencies have continued to support khayal music prominently, making it accessible to the public of the nation through concerts, recordings, music education, grants and fellowships, etc.

The second half of the twentieth century was also a period when khayal entered the global stage on several levels. On the one hand, beginning in the 1960s, instrumental artists such as Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan introduced Hindustani classical music genres to mainstream audiences in Europe and North America through concerts, collaborations with popular musicians and training of non-Indian disciples. On the other hand, the growing Indian diaspora implied transnational audiences, patrons and students for the classical form.

<text>Ibn ʿArabī (, ; full name: , ; 1165–1240) was an Andalusi Sunni scholar, Sufi mystic, poet, and philosopher who was extremely influential within Islamic thought. Out of the 850 works attributed to him, some 700 are authentic, while over 400 are still extant. His cosmological teachings became the dominant worldview in many parts of the Muslim world.

His traditional title was &quot;Muḥyiddīn&quot; (; &quot;The Reviver of Religion&quot;). After his death, practitioners of Sufism began referring to him by the honorific title &quot;Shaykh al-Akbar&quot;, () from which the name Akbarism is derived. Ibn ʿArabī is considered a saint by some scholars and Muslim communities.

Ibn &#x27;Arabi is known for being the first person to explicitly delineate the concept of &quot;wahdat al-wujud&quot; (&quot;Unity of Being&quot;), a monist doctrine which claimed that all things in the universe are manifestations of a singular &quot;reality&quot;. Ibn &#x27;Arabi equated this &quot;reality&quot; with the entity he described as &quot;the Absolute Being&quot; (&quot;al-wujud al-mutlaq&quot;).

==Early life==
Ibn ʿArabī was born in Murcia, Al-Andalus on the 17th of Ramaḍān 560 AH (28 July 1165 AD), although other sources suggest the 27th of Ramaḍān 560 AH (6 August 1165 AD) as an alternative birthdate. His first name is Muhammad, but later called &#x27;Abū &#x27;Abdullāh (mean: &quot;the father of Abdullāh&quot;)—according to classical Arabic tradition—after he had a son. In some of his works, Ibn ‘Arabî referred to himself with fuller versions of his name as &quot;Abû ‘Abdullâh Muhammad ibn ‘Alî ibn al-‘Arabî al-Tâ’î al-Hâtimî&quot;, where the last three names indicate his noble Arab lineage. Indeed, Hâtim al-Tây’î was well known as a poet of pre-Islamic Arabia from the South Arabian tribe of Tayyi (now Yemen).

===Family===
Ibn ʿArabī was of Arab descent. He came from a mixed background, whose father was an Arab descended from emigrants to Al-Andalus in the early years of the Arab conquest of Iberia, while his mother was presumably of Berber descent. In his &quot;Futūḥāt al-Makkīyah,&quot; he writes of a deceased maternal uncle, a prince of Tlemcen who abandoned wealth for an ascetic life after encountering a Sufi mystic. His paternal ancestry came from Yemen and belongs to one of the oldest Arab strains in Andalusia, they having probably migrated during the second waves of the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula.

His father, ‘Ali ibn Muḥammad, served in the Army of Ibn Mardanīsh, the ruler of Murcia. When Murcia fell to the Almohad Caliphate in 1172, Ibn Mardanīsh did not survive the defeat and was killed in battle, leading to his father pledging allegiance to the Almohad Caliph Abū Ya’qūb Yūsuf I. At that time Ibn ʿArabī was only 7 years old, and his family relocated from Murcia to Seville to serve the new ruler.

Ibn ʿArabī had three wives. He married Maryam, a woman from an influential family, when he was still a young adult and lived in Andalusia. Maryam also shared his aspiration to follow the Sufi path, as quoted by Austin in &quot;Sufis of Andalusia&quot;: &quot;My saintly wife, Maryam bint Muhammad binti Abdun, said, ‘I have seen in my sleep someone whom I have never seen in the flesh, but who appears to me in my moments of (spiritual) ecstasy. He ask me whether I was aspiring to the Way, to which I replied that I was, but that I did not know by what means to arrive at it. He then told me that I would come to it through five things: trust, certainty, patience, resolution and veracity.’ Thus she offered her vision to me (for my consideration) and I told her that was indeed the method of the Folk (Sufis). I myself have never seen one with that degree of mystical experience.&quot; When Ibn ʿArabī stayed in Anatolia for several years, according to various Arabic and Persian sources, he married the widow of Majduuddin and took charge of the education of his young son, Sadruddin al-Qunawi. Ibn ʿArabī also mentioned his third wife in his writings, the mother of his son Imāduddin, to whom he bequeathed the first copy of &quot;Futūḥāt al-Makkīyah&quot;.

===Teachers===

Ibn &#x27;Arabi studied under many scholars of his time, many of whom were mentioned in the ijaza (permission to teach and transmit) written to al-Muzaffar Baha&#x27; al-Din Ghazi (son of al-&#x27;Adil I the Ayyubid). Among the most prominent were:

He was a descendant of Zaki al-Din &#x27;Ali b. Muhammad b. al-Zaki (d. 564/1169), the Shafi&#x27;i chief qadi of Damascus, who formed a powerful political alliance with the &#x27;Asakir family (Banu &#x27;Asakir), whose members occupied prestigious positions as judges and scholars of the Shafi&#x27;i school of Sunni law in Damascus for close to three centuries (late eleventh to early fourteenth centuries).
* Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi (d. 672/1273)
* Baybars (d. 676/1277)

===First vision===

Ibn ʿArabī grew up at the ruling court and received military training. As he confessed in &quot;al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya&quot;, he preferred playing in a military camp with his friends rather than reading a book. However, it was when he was a teenager that he experienced his first vision (&quot;fanā&quot;); and later he wrote of this experience as &quot;the differentiation of the universal reality comprised by that look&quot;.

His father, on noticing a change in him, had mentioned this to philosopher and judge, Ibn Rushd (Averroes), who asked to meet Ibn Arabi. Ibn Arabi said that from this first meeting, he had learned to perceive a distinction between formal knowledge of rational thought and the unveiling of insights into the nature of things. He then adopted Sufism (Tasawwuf) and dedicated his life to the spiritual path.

===Pilgrimage to Mecca===
Ibn Arabi left Andalusia for the first time at age 28 and arrived at Tunis in 1193. After a year in Tunisia, he returned to Andalusia in 1194. His father died soon after Ibn Arabi arrived at Seville. When his mother died some months later he left Andalusia for the second time and traveled with his two sisters to Fez, Morocco in 1195. He returned to Córdoba, Andalusia in 1198, and left Andalusia crossing from Gibraltar for the last time in 1200. While there, he received a vision instructing him to journey east. He then visited various places in the Maghreb, including Fez in Morocco, where he accepted spiritual mentorship under Mohammed ibn Qasim al-Tamimi. In 1200, he took leave from one of his most important teachers, Shaykh Abu Ya&#x27;qub Yusuf ibn Yakhlaf al-Kumi, then living in the town of Salé. He left Tunisia in 1201 and arrived for the Hajj in 1202. He lived in Mecca for three years, and there began writing his work &quot;Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya&quot; (), &quot;The Meccan Illuminations&quot;—only part of which has been translated into English by various scholars such as Eric Winkel.

===Journey north===

After spending time in Mecca, he traveled throughout Syria, Palestine, Iraq, and Anatolia. In 1204, Ibn Arabi met Shaykh Majduddīn Isḥāq ibn Yūsuf (شيخ مجد الدين إسحاق بن يوسف), a native of Malatya and a man of great standing at the Seljuk court. This time Ibn Arabi was traveling north; first they visited Medina and in 1205 they entered Baghdad. This visit offered him a chance to meet the direct disciples of Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qādir Jīlānī. Ibn Arabi stayed there only for 12 days because he wanted to visit Mosul to see his friend ‘Alī ibn ‘Abdallāh ibn Jāmi’, a disciple of the mystic Qaḍīb al-Bān (471-573 AH/1079-1177 AD; قضيب البان). There he spent the month of Ramaḍan and composed &quot;Tanazzulāt al-Mawṣiliyya&quot; (تنزلات الموصلية), &quot;Kitāb al-Jalāl wa’l-Jamāl&quot; (كتاب الجلال والجمال, &quot;The Book of Majesty and Beauty&quot;) and &quot;Kunh mā lā Budda lil-MurīdMinhu&quot;.

===Return south===
In the year 1206, Ibn Arabi visited Jerusalem, Mecca, and Egypt. It was the first time that he had passed through Syria, visiting Aleppo and Damascus.

Later in 1207, he returned to Mecca where he continued to study and write, spending his time with his friend Abū Shujā bin Rustem and family, including Niẓām.

The next four to five years of Ibn Arabi&#x27;s life were spent in these lands and he also kept traveling and holding reading sessions of his works in his own presence.

=== Final years ===

After leaving Andalusia for the last time at the age of 33 (1198 AD) and wandering in the Islamic world for about 25 years, at the age of 58 (1223 AD) Ibn Arabi chose Damascus as his final home and dedicated his life for teaching and writing. In this city, he composed the &quot;Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam&quot; in 1229 and finalized two manuscripts of &quot;Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya&quot; in 1231 and 1238.

==Death==
Ibn Arabi died on 22 Rabī‘ al-Thānī 638 AH (16 November 1240) at the age of 75. He was buried in the Banu Zaki cemetery, family cemetery of the nobles of Damascus, on Qasiyun Hill, Salihiyya, Damascus.

==Legacy==
After his death, Ibn Arabi&#x27;s teachings quickly spread throughout the Islamic world. His writings were not limited to Muslim elites but made their way into other ranks of society through the widespread reach of the Sufi orders. Arabi&#x27;s work is also popularly spread through works in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu. Many popular poets were trained in the Sufi orders and were inspired by Arabi&#x27;s concepts. 

Others scholars in his time like al-Munawi, Ibn &#x27;Imad al-Hanbali and al-Fayruzabadi all praised Ibn Arabi as &quot;A righteous friend of Allah and faithful scholar of knowledge&quot;, &quot;the absolute mujtahid (independent thinker) without doubt&quot; and &quot;the imam of the people of shari&#x27;a both in knowledge and in legacy, the educator of the people of the way in practice and in knowledge, and the shaykh of the shaykhs of the people of truth though spiritual experience (&quot;dhawq&quot;) and understanding&quot;.

==Islamic law==
Although Ibn Arabi stated on more than one occasion that he did not blindly follow any one of the schools of Islamic jurisprudence, he was responsible for copying and preserving books of the Zahirite or literalist school, to which there is fierce debate over his adherence. Many prominent Ibn Arabi scholars, including Addas, Chodkiewicz, Gril, Winkel and Al-Gorab, contend that he did not follow any madhhab. Some scholars, such as Hamza Dudgeon and Ignaz Goldziher, reject this notion. Goldziher held that Ibn Arabi did belong to the Zahirite or Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence.

On an extant manuscript of Ibn Ḥazm, as transmitted by Ibn ʿArabī, Ibn ʿArabī gives an introduction to the work where he describes a vision he had:

Goldziher says, &quot;The period between the sixth (hijri) and the seventh century seems also to have been the prime of the Ẓāhirite school in Andalusia.&quot;

Ibn Arabi did delve into specific details at times and was known for his view that religiously binding consensus could only serve as a source of sacred law if it was the consensus of the first generation of Muslims who had witnessed revelation directly.

Ibn Arabi also expounded on Sufi allegories of the Sharia, building upon previous work by Al-Ghazali and al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi.

==Theoretical mysticism==

Ibn Arabi is counted as the founder of the great schools of mystical thought in Islamic history. The milieu he had lived in had a spiritual atmosphere of mystical and esoteric experiences. Many mystical currents and movements were prevalent in Islamic Andalusia. Some, such as those of Ibn Barrajan, Ibn Arif and Ibn Qasi, gave a dynamism to mysticism. The social and spiritual atmosphere of the Islamic East – such as Iran, Syria, and Iraq – also affected this milieu. Among these conditions are schools such as Avicennism, Suhrawardi and Illuminationism.

In his adolescent and youth period, there were many mystical currents in his production. He referred to nearly seventy teachers in one of his works.

Ibn Arabi believed in three kinds of knowledge. The first is rational knowledge, the conclusion of theoretical reason, which could be true and/or false. The second kind of knowledge is delight (dhawq), which is not acquired by rational reflection. In other words, it is impossible to bring them into any argument or proof for reason. The knowledge of love, pleasure or sexual intercourse are samples for second knowledge. The third knowledge is mysterious knowledge, which is beyond the boundaries of reason. This knowledge, which Ibn Arabi also called divine knowledge, is dedicated to divine prophets and his disciples. He believed that true knowledge, namely knowledge of something in itself, belonged only to God and that every definition of knowledge is useless. Knowledge has a divine nature. According to him, the real Being has eternal consciousness of its reality. This real Being has the One-many nature. In other words, God is named by many names whilst it is one singular reality.

===Imagination===
According to William Chittick, little attention has been paid to the importance of imagination in Ibn Arabi. Before Ibn Arabi, imagination counted as one faculty among senses but Ibn Arabi tried to develop it conceptually. He interpreted imagination as follows: all beings are images of real Being and non-being. In other words, all things have two dimensions being and non-being. The universe and all other things counted as imagination which has a middle nature between sheer reality and utter nothing. All things are considered as qualities and reflections of one thing in many ways. Iit refers to theory of the unity of existence.

===Al-Insān al-kāmil===
The doctrine of perfect man (&quot;Al-Insān al-Kāmil&quot;) is popularly considered an honorific title attributed to Muhammad having its origins in Islamic mysticism, although the concept&#x27;s origin is controversial and disputed. Arabi may have first coined this term in referring to Adam as found in his work &quot;Fusus al-hikam&quot;, explained as an individual who binds himself with the Divine and creation.

Taking an idea already common within Sufi culture, Ibn Arabi applied deep analysis and reflection on the concept of a perfect human and one&#x27;s pursuit in fulfilling this goal. In developing his explanation of the perfect being, Ibn Arabi first discusses the issue of oneness through the metaphor of the mirror.

In this philosophical metaphor, Ibn Arabi compares an object being reflected in countless mirrors to the relationship between God and his creatures. God&#x27;s essence is seen in the existent human being, as God is the object and human beings the mirrors. This means two things; that since humans are mere reflections of God there can be no distinction or separation between the two and, without God, the creatures would be non-existent. When an individual understands that there is no separation between human and God they begin on the path of ultimate oneness. The one who decides to walk in this oneness pursues the true reality and responds to God&#x27;s longing to be known. The search within for this reality of oneness causes one to be reunited with God, as well as, improve self-consciousness.

The perfect human, through this developed self-consciousness and self-realization, prompts divine self-manifestation. This causes the perfect human to be of both divine and earthly origin. Ibn Arabi metaphorically calls him an Isthmus. Being an Isthmus between heaven and Earth, the perfect human fulfills God&#x27;s desire to be known. God&#x27;s presence can be realized through him by others. Ibn Arabi expressed that through self manifestation one acquires divine knowledge, which he called the primordial spirit of Muhammad and all its perfection. Ibn Arabi details that the perfect human is of the cosmos to the divine and conveys the divine spirit to the cosmos.

Ibn Arabi further explained the perfect man concept using at least twenty-two different descriptions and various aspects when considering the Logos. He contemplated the Logos, or &quot;Universal Man&quot;, as a mediation between the individual human and the divine essence.

Ibn Arabi believed Muhammad to be the primary perfect man who exemplifies the morality of God. Ibn Arabi regarded the first entity brought into existence as the reality or essence of Muhammad (&quot;al-ḥaqīqa al-Muhammadiyya&quot;), master of all creatures, and a primary role model for human beings to emulate. Ibn Arabi believed that God&#x27;s attributes and names are manifested in this world, with the most complete and perfect display of these divine attributes and names seen in Muhammad. Ibn Arabi believed that one may see God in the mirror of Muhammad. He maintained that Muhammad was the best proof of God and, by knowing Muhammad, one knows God. 

Ibn Arabi also described Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and all other prophets and various &quot;Anbiya&#x27; Allah&quot; (Muslim messengers) as perfect men, but never tires of attributing lordship, inspirational source, and highest rank to Muhammad. Ibn Arabi compares his own status as a perfect man as being but a single dimension to the comprehensive nature of Muhammad. Ibn &#x27;Arabi makes extraordinary assertions regarding his own spiritual rank, but qualifying this rather audacious correlation by asserting his &quot;inherited&quot; perfection is only a single dimension of the comprehensive perfection of Muhammad.

==Reaction==

The reaction of Ibn &#x27;Abd as-Salam, a Muslim scholar respected by both Ibn Arabi&#x27;s supporters and detractors, has been of note due to disputes over whether he himself was a supporter or detractor. He was known by the title of Sultan al-&#x27;Ulama, the Sultan of scholars, was a famous mujtahid, Ash&#x27;ari theologian, jurist and the leading Shafi&#x27;i authority of his generation. As such, the figure of Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam was claimed by each faction of the Ibn-&#x27;Arabi controversy due to his impeccable record as a staunch champion of the shari&#x27;a.

Ibn Taymiyyah&#x27;s report was based on the authority of two reliable transmitters, Abu Bakr b. Salar and Ibn Daqiq al-&#x27;Id. According to it, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam declared Ibn &#x27;Arabi &quot;a master of evil&quot; and &quot;a disgusting man&quot;, who &quot;professed the eternity of the world and did not proscribe fornication.&quot; This severe verdict, whose authenticity Ibn Taymiyyah considered to be beyond doubt, was pronounced by Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam upon his arrival in Egypt in 639/1241- that is, one year after his death. The versions of the story furnished by al-Safadi, a cautious supporter of Ibn &#x27;Arabi, and al-Dhahabi, his bitter critic, and teacher of al-Safadi, are especially helpful in placing Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam&#x27;s censure into a meaningful historical framework. Both al-Safadi and al-Dhahabi insisted that they read the story recorded in Ibn Sayyid al-Nas&#x27;s own hand. And yet, their versions vary. Both variants describe Ibn Daqiq al-&#x27;Id&#x27;s astonishment at his teacher&#x27;s sharp critique of the acclaimed wali, which caused him to ask for proof of Ibn &#x27;Arabi&#x27;s lies. Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam obliged by the following reply (in al-Safadi&#x27;s recension): &quot;He used to deny [the possibility] of marriage between human beings and the jinn, since, according to him, the jinn are subtle spirits, whereas human beings are solid bodies, hence the two cannot unite. Later on, however, he claimed that he had married a woman from the jinnfolk, who stayed with him for a while, then hit him with a camel&#x27;s bone and injured him. He used to show us the scar on his face which, by that time, had closed.&quot; In al-Dhahabi&#x27;s rendition: &quot;He [Ibn &#x27;Arabi] said: I married a she-jinni, and she blessed me with three children. Then it so happened that I made her angry and she hit me with a bone that caused this scar, whereupon she departed and I have never seen her again since.&quot; The authenticity of Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam&#x27;s disparagement of Ibn &#x27;Arabi seems to find support in his &quot;Epistle on the [Saintly] Substitutes and the [Supreme] Succor&quot; (Risala fil-&#x27;abdal wal-ghawth)

On the other hand, another narration in praise of Ibn &#x27;Arabi by al-Izz is reported by &#x27;Abd al-Ghaffar al-Qusi, al-Fayruzabadi, al-Qari al-Baghdadi, al-Suyuti, al-Sha&#x27;rani, al-Maqqari, Ibn al-&#x27;Imad, and some other supporters. Despite minor variations in their accounts, all of them cite the same source: lbn &#x27;Abd al-Salam&#x27;s unnamed servant or student. In al-Qusi&#x27;s redaction, Ibn &#x27;Abd al Salam and his servant were passing by Ibn &#x27;Arabi, who instructed his disciples in the Great Umayyad Mosque of Damuscus. Suddenly, the servant recalled that Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam had promised to reveal to him the identity of the supreme saint of the epoch, the &quot;Pole of the Age&quot;. The question caught Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam off guard. He paused hesitantly for a moment, then pointed in the direction of Ibn &#x27;Arabi, saying: &quot;He is the Pole!&quot; &quot;And this in spite of what you have said against him?&quot; asked the servant. Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam ignored this remark and simply repeated his reply. In al-Fayruzabadi&#x27;s version of the story, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam is presented as a secret admirer of his who was fully aware of the latter&#x27;s exalted status in the Sufi hierarchy. However, as a public figure, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam was careful to conceal his genuine opinion of the controversial Sufi to &quot;preserve the outward aspect of the religious law&quot;. In so doing, he, according to al-Fayruzabadi, shrewdly avoided an inevitable confrontation with the &quot;jurists,&quot; who viewed Ibn &#x27;Arabi as a heretic.

The importance of Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam&#x27;s ambiguous evaluation of Ibn Arabi for the subsequent polemic is further attested by the detailed treatment of this story in al-Fasi&#x27;s massive biographical dictionary, &quot;The Precious Necklace&quot; (al-&#x27;lqd al-thamin). A bitter critic of Ibn &#x27;Arabi&#x27;s monistic views, al-Fasi rejected the Sufi version of the story as sheer fabrication. Yet, as a scrupulous muhaddith, he tried to justify his position through the methods current in hadith criticism: &quot;I have a strong suspicion that this story was invented by the extremist Sufis who were infatuated with Ibn &#x27;Arabi. Thereupon the story gained wide diffusion until it reached some trustworthy people, who accepted it in good faith ... My suspicion regarding the authenticity of this story has grown stronger because of the unfounded supposition that Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam&#x27;s praise of Ibn &#x27;Arabi had occurred simultaneously with his censure of him. Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam&#x27;s statement that he censured Ibn &#x27;Arabi out of concern for the shari&#x27;a inescapably implies that Ibn &#x27;Arabi enjoyed a high rank in the same moment as Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam was censuring him. Such a blunder could not have happened to any reliable religious scholar, let alone to someone as knowledgeable and righteous as Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam. Anyone who suspects him of this makes a mistake and sins [by holding him responsible for] mutually contradictory statements ... One may try to explain Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam&#x27;s praise of Ibn &#x27;Arabi, if it indeed took place, by the fact that [Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam] was hesitating between praise and censure, because at the time he spoke Ibn &#x27;Arabi&#x27;s state had changed for the better. If so, there is no contradiction in Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam&#x27;s words. Were we to admit that the praise occurred, it was nevertheless abrogated by Ibn Daqiq al-&#x27;Id&#x27;s report concerning lbn &#x27;Abd al-Salam&#x27;s [later] condemnation of lbn &#x27;Arabi. For Ibn Daqiq al-&#x27;Id could only hear Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam in Egypt, that is, a few years after Ibn &#x27;Arabi&#x27;s death. This cannot be otherwise because he ... was educated at Qus, where he had studied the Maliki madhhab, until he mastered it completely. Only then he come to Cairo to study the Shafi&#x27;i madhhab and other sciences under Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam&#x27;s guidance. ... His departure could only take place after 640, by which time Ibn &#x27;Arabi had already been dead. ... Now, Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam&#x27;s praise, as the story itself testifies, occurred when Ibn &#x27;Arabi was still alive. For did he not point to [Ibn &#x27;Arabi], when that individual [the servant] asked him about the Pole or the [greatest] saint of the age?&quot;

=== Creed ===
His best-known book, entitled &#x27;al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya&#x27; (The Meccan Victories or Illuminations) begins with a statement of doctrine (belief) about which al-Safadi (d. 764/1363) said: &quot;I saw (read) that (al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya) from beginning to end. It consists of the doctrine of Abu al-Hasan al-Ash&#x27;ari without any difference (deviation) whatsoever.&quot;

==Works==
Some 800 works are attributed to Ibn Arabi, although only some have been authenticated. Recent research suggests that over 100 of his works have survived in manuscript form, although most printed versions have not yet been critically edited and include many errors. A specialist of Ibn &#x27;Arabi, William Chittick, referring to Osman Yahya&#x27;s definitive bibliography of the Andalusian&#x27;s works, says that, out of the 850 works attributed to him, some 700 are authentic while over 400 are still extant.
* &quot;The Meccan Illuminations&quot; (&quot;Al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya&quot;), his largest work in 37 volumes originally and published in 4 or 8 volumes in modern times, discussing a wide range of topics from mystical philosophy to Sufi practices and records of his dreams/visions. It totals 560 chapters. In modern editions it amounts to some 15 000 pages.
* &quot;The Ringstones of Wisdom&quot; (also translated as &quot;The Bezels of Wisdom&quot;), or &quot;Fusus al-Hikam&quot;. Composed during the later period of Ibn &#x27;Arabi&#x27;s life, the work is sometimes considered his most important and can be characterized as a summary of his teachings and mystical beliefs. It deals with the role played by various prophets in divine revelation. The attribution of this work (Fusus al-Hikam) to Ibn Arabi is debated and in at least one source is described as a forgery and false attribution to him reasoning that there are 74 books in total attributed to Sheikh Ibn Arabi of which 56 have been mentioned in &quot;Al Futuhat al-Makkiyya&quot; and the rest mentioned in the other books cited therein. However many other scholars accept the work as genuine.
* The &quot;Dīwān&quot;, his collection of poetry spanning five volumes, mostly unedited. The printed versions available are based on only one volume of the original work.
* &quot;The Holy Spirit in the Counselling of the Soul&quot; (&quot;Rūḥ al-quds&quot;), a treatise on the soul which includes a summary of his experience from different spiritual masters in the Maghrib. Part of this has been translated as &quot;Sufis of Andalusia&quot;, reminiscences and spiritual anecdotes about many interesting people whom he met in al-Andalus.
* &quot;Contemplation of the Holy Mysteries&quot; (&quot;Mashāhid al-Asrār&quot;), probably his first major work, consisting of fourteen visions and dialogues with God.
* &quot;Divine Sayings&quot; (&quot;Mishkāt al-Anwār&quot;), an important collection made by Ibn &#x27;Arabī of 101 hadīth qudsī
* &quot;The Book of Annihilation in Contemplation&quot; (&quot;K. al-Fanā&#x27; fi&#x27;l-Mushāhada&quot;), a short treatise on the meaning of mystical annihilation (&quot;fana&quot;).
* &quot;Devotional Prayers&quot; (&quot;Awrād&quot;), a widely read collection of fourteen prayers for each day and night of the week.
* &quot;Journey to the Lord of Power&quot; (&quot;Risālat al-Anwār&quot;), a detailed technical manual and roadmap for the &quot;journey without distance&quot;.
* &quot;The Book of God&#x27;s Days&quot; (&quot;Ayyām al-Sha&#x27;n&quot;), a work on the nature of time and the different kinds of days experienced by gnostics
* &quot;The Astounding Phoenix regarding the Seal of Saints and the Sun of the West&quot; (, ), a book on the meaning of sainthood and its culmination in Jesus and the Mahdī
* &quot;The Universal Tree and the Four Birds&quot; (&quot;al-Ittihād al-Kawnī&quot;), a poetic book on the Complete Human and the four principles of existence
* &quot;Prayer for Spiritual Elevation and Protection&quot; (&quot;&#x27;al-Dawr al-A&#x27;lā&quot;), a short prayer which is still widely used in the Muslim world
* &quot;The Interpreter of Desires&quot; (&quot;Tarjumān al-Ashwāq&quot;), a collection of nasībs which, in response to critics, Ibn Arabi republished with a commentary explaining the meaning of the poetic symbols. (1215)
* &quot;Divine Governance of the Human Kingdom&quot; (&quot;At-Tadbidrat al-ilahiyyah fi islah al-mamlakat al-insaniyyah&quot;).
* &quot;The Four Pillars of Spiritual Transformation&quot; (&quot;Hilyat al-abdāl&quot;) a short work on the essentials of the spiritual Path

===The Meccan Illuminations (Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya)===

According to Claude Addas, Ibn Arabi began writing &quot;Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya&quot; after he arrived in Mecca in 1202. After almost thirty years, the first draft of &quot;Futūḥāt&quot; was completed in December 1231 (629 AH), and Ibn Arabi bequeathed it to his son. Two years before his death, Ibn ‘Arabī finished a second draft of the &quot;Futūḥāt&quot; in 1238 (636 AH), of which included several additions and deletions as compared with the previous draft, that contains 560 chapters. The second draft, the more widely circulated version, was bequeathed to his disciple, Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi. Many scholars have attempted to translate this book from Arabic into other languages, but there is no complete translation of &quot;Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya&quot; to this day.

===The Bezels of Wisdom (Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam)===
There have been many commentaries on Ibn &#x27;Arabī&#x27;s &quot;Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam&quot;: Osman Yahya named more than 100 while Michel Chodkiewicz precises that &quot;this list is far from exhaustive.&quot; The first one was &quot;Kitab al-Fukūk&quot; written by Ṣadr al-Dīn al-Qunawī who had studied the book with Ibn &#x27;Arabī; the second by Qunawī&#x27;s student, Mu&#x27;ayyad al-Dīn al-Jandi, which was the first line-by-line commentary; the third by Jandī&#x27;s student, Dawūd al-Qaysarī, which became very influential in the Persian-speaking world. A recent English translation of Ibn &#x27;Arabī&#x27;s own summary of the &quot;Fuṣūṣ, Naqsh al-Fuṣūṣ&quot; (The Imprint or Pattern of the Fusus) as well a commentary on this work by &#x27;Abd al-Raḥmān Jāmī, &quot;Naqd al-Nuṣūṣ fī Sharḥ Naqsh al-Fuṣūṣ&quot; (1459), by William Chittick was published in Volume 1 of the &quot;Journal of the Muhyiddin Ibn &#x27;Arabi Society&quot; (1982).

==== Critical editions and translations of Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam ====
The &quot;Fuṣūṣ&quot; was first critically edited in Arabic by &#x27;Afīfī (1946) that become the standard in scholarly works. Later in 2015, Ibn al-Arabi Foundation in Pakistan published the Urdu translation, including the new critical of Arabic edition. 

The first English translation was done in partial form by Angela Culme-Seymour from the French translation of Titus Burckhardt as &quot;Wisdom of the Prophets&quot; (1975), and the first full translation was by Ralph Austin as &quot;Bezels of Wisdom&quot; (1980). There is also a complete French translation by Charles-Andre Gilis, entitled &quot;Le livre des chatons des sagesses&quot; (1997). The only major commentary to have been translated into English so far is entitled &quot;Ismail Hakki Bursevi&#x27;s translation and commentary on Fusus al-hikam by Muhyiddin Ibn &#x27;Arabi&quot;, translated from Ottoman Turkish by Bulent Rauf in 4 volumes (1985–1991).

In Urdu, the most widespread and authentic translation was made by Shams Ul Mufasireen Bahr-ul-uloom Hazrat (Muhammad Abdul Qadeer Siddiqi Qadri -Hasrat), the former Dean and Professor of Theology of the Osmania University, Hyderabad. It is due to this reason that his translation is in the curriculum of Punjab University. Maulvi Abdul Qadeer Siddiqui has made an interpretive translation and explained the terms and grammar while clarifying the Shaikh&#x27;s opinions. A new edition of the translation was published in 2014 with brief annotations throughout the book for the benefit of contemporary Urdu reader.

==In fiction==

In the Turkish television series &quot;Diriliş: Ertuğrul&quot;, Ibn Arabi was portrayed by Ozman Sirgood. In 2017, Saudi Arabian novelist Mohammed Hasan Alwan won the International Prize for Arabic Fiction for his novel &quot;A Small Death&quot;, a fictionalized account of Ibn Arabi&#x27;s life.

<text>Field Marshal Henry Maitland Wilson, 1st Baron Wilson, (5 September 1881 – 31 December 1964), also known as Jumbo Wilson, was a senior British Army officer of the 20th century. He saw active service in the Second Boer War and then during the First World War on the Somme and at Passchendaele. During the Second World War he served as General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) British Troops in Egypt, in which role he launched Operation Compass, attacking Italian forces with considerable success, in December 1940. He went on to be Military Governor of Cyrenaica in February 1941, commanding a Commonwealth expeditionary force to Greece in April 1941 and General Officer Commanding (GOC) British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan in May 1941.

Wilson became GOC Ninth Army in Syria and Palestine in October 1941, GOC Persia and Iraq Command in August 1942 and GOC Middle East Command in February 1943. He was Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean from January 1944 and Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission in Washington D. C. from January 1945 until 1947.

==Early life and military service==
Born in London, England, the son of Captain Arthur Maitland Wilson and his wife Harriet Wilson (née Kingscote), Wilson was educated at Eton College and Sandhurst. He was commissioned into the Rifle Brigade as a 2nd lieutenant on 10 March 1900. He served with the 2nd Battalion in South Africa in the Second Boer War, and having taken part in operations there in August 1900, was promoted to lieutenant on 18 March 1901. He served in South Africa throughout the war. Following the end of hostilities, he left Port Natal on the SS &quot;Malta&quot; in late September 1902, together with other officers and men of the 2nd Battalion, Rifle Brigade who were transferred to Egypt. He was posted with his battalion to Egypt and then in 1907 to India. Promoted to captain on 2 April 1908 he served with the 3rd Battalion at Bordon in Hampshire and then in County Tipperary in Ireland, and in 1911 became Adjutant of the Oxford OTC.

Wilson served in the First World War, being appointed brigade major of the 48th Brigade on 15 October 1914; having been promoted to the rank of acting major in December 1914 and then to the substantive rank of major on 15 September 1915, he was sent to France to serve on the Western Front in December 1915. His capabilities as a staff officer led to him being moved to become General Staff Officer (GSO) 2 of the 41st Division on the Somme and of the XIX Corps at Passchendaele. In October 1917 he was appointed GSO 1 of the New Zealand Division with promotion to temporary lieutenant colonel on 28 October 1917. For his war service he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1917 and was thrice mentioned in despatches.

After being promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1919 and being hand-picked for the first post-war staff course at Camberley, Wilson was given command of a company of cadets at Sandhurst. He then became second-in-command of the 2nd Battalion, the Rifle Brigade at Aldershot in August 1923. Next he took command of his regiment&#x27;s 1st Battalion on the North-West Frontier in January 1927, receiving promotion to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel on 15 June 1927.

Returning to be an instructor at Camberley in June 1930, Wilson spent 9 months on half pay in 1933. Promoted to temporary brigadier, he became Commander of 6th Infantry Brigade in 1934 and having been promoted to major-general on 30 April 1935, he became General Officer Commanding 2nd Division in August 1937.

==Second World War==
===Egypt (1939–1941)===
On 15 June 1939, Wilson was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the British Troops in Egypt, with the rank of lieutenant-general, in which role he was also responsible for giving military advice for a range of countries from Abyssinia to the Persian Gulf. He made his HQ in Cairo and undertook successful negotiations with the Egyptian government at their summer quarters in Alexandria. The Treaty of 1936 called for the Egyptian army to fight under British command in the event of war and to supplement the limited force then at his disposal – an armoured division then being formed (later to be the 7th Armoured Division) and eight British battalions. He concentrated his defensive forces at Mersa Matruh some 100 miles from the border with Libya.

Early in August, Sir Archibald Wavell was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Command, and he sent reinforcements which had been sought by Wilson, initially the 4th Indian Infantry Division and advanced elements of 6th Australian Division and, as the buildup at Mersa Matruh continued, Richard O&#x27;Connor and his staff at 7th Infantry Division in Palestine were moved to Egypt to reinforce Wilson&#x27;s command structure there. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s HQ, initially designated British 6th Infantry Division, was activated in November and became responsible for the troops at Mersa Matruh. It was redesignated Western Desert Force in June 1940.

On 10 June 1940, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini declared war. Wilson&#x27;s forces immediately invaded Libya. However, their advance was reversed when on 17 June France sought an armistice and the Italians were able to move their forces from the Tunisian border in the West and reinforce with 4 divisions those that opposed Wilson in the East. The Italian forces invaded Egypt in September 1940, and advanced some to occupy Sidi Barrani. Wilson was facing very superior forces. He had 31,000 troops to the Italians&#x27; 80,000, 120 tanks against 275, and 120 artillery pieces against 250. He realised that the situation was one where the traditional text books would not provide a solution. As with other 1940s commanders he had been well-schooled in strategy, and in thorough secrecy; he planned to disrupt the advance of the superior forces by attacking their extended lines at the right spots. After a conference with Anthony Eden and Wavell in October and rejecting Wavell&#x27;s suggestion for a two-pronged attack, Wilson launched Operation Compass on 7 December 1940. The strategy was outstandingly successful and very quickly the Italian forces were cut in half.

While Operation Compass continued successfully in 1941 and resulted in the complete defeat of the Italian Army in North Africa, Wilson, who was already highly regarded by his First World War regimental colleague and now Secretary of State for War, Anthony Eden, had also won the confidence of Churchill himself. In a broadcast Churchill said, &quot;General Wilson, who actually commands the Army of the Nile, was reputed to be one of our finest tacticians, and few will now deny him that quality.&quot;

Wilson was recalled to Cairo in February 1941 where he was offered and accepted the position of Military Governor of Cyrenaica.

===Greece (April 1941)===
Wilson was appointed to lead a Commonwealth expeditionary force (&quot;W Force&quot;) of two infantry divisions and an armoured brigade to help Greece resist Italy and the subsequent German invasion in April 1941. Although the Allied forces were hopelessly inadequate Churchill&#x27;s War Cabinet had thought it important to provide support for the only country outside the Commonwealth which was resisting the Axis advance. Wilson completed the evacuation of British troops from Greece on 29 April 1941. He was appointed a GBE on 4 March 1941 and promoted to full general on 31 May 1941.

===Syria, Iraq and Palestine (1941–1943)===
In May 1941, on his return from Greece, Wilson was appointed GOC British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan and oversaw the successful Syria-Lebanon campaign, in which predominantly Australian, British, Indian, and Free French forces overcame Vichy French forces in fierce fighting. In July 1941 Churchill recommended Wilson to take command of the Western Desert Force to lead it in its upcoming offensive operation against the Afrika Korps, what would become Operation Crusader of November 1941, but General Sir Claude Auchinleck preferred instead Lieutenant-General Sir Alan Cunningham. In October 1941 Wilson took command of the Ninth Army in Syria and Palestine and was appointed to the honorary title of Aide-de-Camp General to the King.

Wilson enjoyed the confidence of Winston Churchill and he was Churchill&#x27;s choice to succeed Auchinleck as commander of the Eighth Army in August 1942; however at the urging of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Sir Alan Brooke, General Sir Bernard Montgomery was appointed to the post. Instead, Wilson was appointed to command the newly created independent Persia and Iraq Command on 21 August 1942. This command, which had been part of Middle East Command, was created when it appeared that Germany, following successes in southern Russia, might invade Persia (Iran).

===C-in-C Middle East (1943)===
In February 1943, after Montgomery&#x27;s success at Alamein and the expulsion of Axis forces from North Africa, Wilson was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East. The Middle East was by this time comparatively removed from the main centres of fighting. However, on orders from London to create a diversion during the fighting in Italy, in September 1943 he organised an unsuccessful attempt to occupy the small Greek islands of Kos, Leros and Samos. The British forces suffered large losses to German air attacks and subsequent landings.

===Supreme Allied Commander Mediterranean (1944)===

Wilson succeeded Dwight D. &quot;Ike&quot; Eisenhower at Allied Forces Headquarters (AFHQ) as the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean on 8 January 1944 based at Algiers. As such he exercised strategic control over the campaign in Italy. He strongly advocated the invasion of Germany via the Danube plain, but this did not take place when the armies in Italy were weakened to support other theatres of war. Jumbo Wilson was keen to follow through with the deception plan Undercut, when unexpectedly the Germans decided to withdraw from Greece altogether. Although advised by Dudley Clarke that it might backfire and was unnecessary, Wilson was aware of the strategic complexities of the political situation. The General Staff even employed an actor imitating Monty who arrived at Jumbo&#x27;s HQ in Algiers.

===Washington Mission (1945–1947)===

In December 1944, following the death of Field Marshal Sir John Dill, Wilson was relieved as Supreme Commander, promoted to field marshal on 29 December 1944, and sent to Washington to be Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission, a post he took up in January 1945. One of Wilson&#x27;s most secret duties was as the British military representative on the Combined Policy Committee which dealt with the development, production and testing of the atom bomb. Wilson continued to serve as head of the British Joint Staff Mission until 1947, to the satisfaction of Britain and the United States. President Truman awarded him the Distinguished Service Medal in November 1945.

==Post-war==
In January 1946 he was appointed aide-de-camp to George VI of the United Kingdom and was then created Baron Wilson, of Libya and of Stowlangtoft in the County of Suffolk. From 1955 to 1960 he was Constable of the Tower of London. Wilson had married Hester Wykeham (1890–1979) in 1914 and had one son and a daughter. The son, Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick Maitland Wilson, accompanied his father in the Middle East during the Second World War as an intelligence officer. The son&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;Where the Nazis Came&quot;, provide anecdotes and descriptions of important events in his father&#x27;s war service. Never a rich man, when Field Marshal Lord Wilson died on 31 December 1964 in Chilton, Buckinghamshire, his estate was proved at only £2,952 (roughly £100,000 in 2013). He was buried at St. George&#x27;s, Stowlangtoft, Suffolk and was succeeded in the barony by his only son Patrick.

<text>Field marshal (or field-marshal, abbreviated as FM) is the most senior military rank, senior to the general officer ranks. Usually, it is the highest rank in an army (in countries without the rank of Generalissimo), and as such, few persons are ever appointed to it. It is considered as a five-star rank (OF-10) in modern-day armed forces in many countries.

Promotion to the rank of field marshal in many countries historically required extraordinary military achievement by a general (a wartime victory). However, the rank has also been used as a divisional command rank and as a brigade command rank. Examples of the different uses of the rank include Afghanistan, Austria-Hungary, Pakistan, Prussia/Germany, India and Sri Lanka for an extraordinary achievement; Spain and Mexico for a divisional command (); and France, Portugal and Brazil for a brigade command (, ).

==Origins==
The origin of the term dates to the early Middle Ages, originally meaning the keeper of the king&#x27;s horses (from Old German &quot;Marh-scalc&quot;, ), from the time of the early Frankish kings; words originally meaning &quot;servant&quot; were sometimes used to mean &quot;subordinate official&quot; or similar. The German Holy Roman Empire and the kingdom of France had officers named &quot;Feldmarschall&quot; and &quot;Maréchal de camp&quot; respectively as far back as the 1600s. The exact wording of the titles used by field marshals varies: examples include &quot;marshal&quot; and &quot;field marshal general&quot;.

The air force equivalent in Commonwealth and many Middle Eastern air forces is marshal of the air force (not to be confused with air marshal). Navies, which usually do not use the nomenclature employed by armies or air forces, use titles such as &quot;fleet admiral,&quot; &quot;grand admiral&quot; or &quot;admiral of the fleet&quot; for the equivalent rank. The traditional attribute distinguishing a field marshal is a baton. The baton nowadays is purely ornamental, and as such may be richly decorated. That said, it is not necessary for the insignia to be a baton (Such is the case in Russia post-1991 and the former Soviet Union, which use a jewelled star referred to as a Marshal&#x27;s star).

==Field marshal ranks by country==

===Afghanistan===
&quot;Sardar&quot; Shah Wali Khan (died 1977), of the Musahiban and uncle of King Zahir and President &quot;Sardar&quot; Mohammed Daoud Khan, was a field marshal. Mohammed Fahim became an honorary marshal in 2004.
Abdul Rashid Dostum became an honorary marshal in 2020 (this position is now defunct). Ghulam Nabi Khan, is sometimes identified as a field marshal.

===Australia===
The first appointment to the rank was Sir William Birdwood, who received the honour in March 1925. Sir Thomas Blamey was the second appointment to the rank, and was the first and so far only Australian-born and Australian Army substantive (not honorary) field marshal. He was promoted to the rank on the insistence of Sir Robert Menzies, the Prime Minister of Australia, in June 1950. His field marshal&#x27;s baton is on display in the Second World War galleries at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. The third appointment was Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who was promoted to the rank on 1 April 1954. The fourth and latest appointment was to King Charles III in October 2024.

===Brazil===

When Brazil became independent from Portugal in 1822, the Portuguese system of ranks was maintained by the Brazilian Army, including the rank of &quot;marechal de campo&quot;. In the second half of the 19th century, the rank of &quot;marechal de campo&quot; was replaced, both in Portugal and Brazil, by the rank of &quot;general de brigada&quot; (brigade general). This last rank still exists today in the Brazilian Army, but corresponds to the present rank of &quot;major-general&quot; (major-general) in the Portuguese Army. 
Today, the rank of &quot;Marechal&quot; is the maximum rank available but only awarded during wartime. The Brazilian Air Force has the similar rank of air marshal.

===Chad===
On the 11 August 2020, Chadian president Idris Déby was promoted to the rank of Marshal for his efforts against terrorism in West Africa. He would die the following year.

===China===

During Imperial rule in China, different dynasties gave different titles to generals. A very similar title is &quot;司馬&quot; (sima) in the Eastern Han dynasty, which literally means &quot;master of horse&quot;, and later became a two-character surname too. &quot;司馬&quot; is one of the Three Excellencies in Eastern Han, who is in charge of the country&#x27;s military affairs. Later, a more common title for a field marshal or a commandant was (元帥 &quot;Yuan Shuai&quot;) or grand field marshal (大元帥 &quot;da yuan shuai&quot;). One of the most famous of these generals was Yue Fei from the Song dynasty. Since the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established in 1949, it has promoted 10 military commanders to the rank of marshal, all in 1955 and abolished in 1965. Since then, the rank has remained defunct. The last Chinese marshal, Nie Rongzhen, died in 1992.

===Ethiopia===
On 8 January 2022, General Birhanu Jula, the Chief of General Staff of the Ethiopian National Defence Force, was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal (or Field Marshal General, depending on source). The rank was introduced to the Ethiopian National Defence Force with this promotion. The rank of Field Marshal was last used in Ethiopia during the Ethiopian Empire in the 20th century, when Emperor Haile Selassie was head of the Imperial Ethiopian Army. The formal ceremonial uniform matched that of its British counterpart, with the exception of headgear, which was a Bicorne adorned with a golden lion&#x27;s mane.

===Finland===

Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim was promoted to Field Marshal in 1933. In 1942 he was promoted to Marshal of Finland, which is not a distinctive military rank but an honour.

===France===
In the French army of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;, the normal brigade command rank was field marshal (&quot;maréchal de camp&quot;). In 1793, during the French Revolution, the rank of field marshal was replaced by the rank of brigade general. The rank insignia of field marshal was two stars (one-star being used for a senior colonel rank). The French field marshal rank was below lieutenant-general, which in 1793 became divisional-general. In the title &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; and the English &quot;field marshal&quot;, there is an etymological confusion in the French &quot;camp&quot; between the English words &quot;camp&quot; and &quot;field&quot;. The French rank of field marshal should not be confused with the rank of Marshal of France, which has been the highest rank of the French Army since the higher dignity of Marshal General of France was abolished in 1848 (although in theory it is not an actual rank but a &quot;state dignity&quot;).

===German-speaking lands===

&quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (&#x27;general field marshal, field marshal general, or field marshal&#x27;, abbreviated to &quot;Feldmarschall&quot;) was the most senior general officer rank in the armies of several German states, including Saxony, Brandenburg-Prussia, Prussia, the German Empire, and lastly, Germany (from 1918). In the Habsburg monarchy, the Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary, the rank &quot;Feldmarschall&quot; was used. The rank was also given to generals in southern German States and Austria by the Holy Roman Emperor during the existence of the Holy Roman Empire up to 1806.

===Greece===

Stratarches (), meaning &quot;Ruler of the Army&quot; in Greek, is a title for senior military commanders dating back to classical antiquity, in the sense of &quot;commander-in-chief&quot;. In modern Greek usage, it has been used to translate the rank of field marshal. In this sense, the rank was borne by the kings of Greece since 1939, and has been awarded only once in modern Greek history to a professional officer: Alexandros Papagos in 1949 for his leadership in the Greek victory against Fascist Italy in World War II and against the Communist forces in the Greek Civil War. The rank is not retained by the current (since 1974) Third Hellenic Republic.

===India===
Field marshal is the highest attainable rank in the Indian Army. It is a ceremonial/war time rank. There have been two Indian field marshals to date. Sam Manekshaw was promoted to the rank in 1973 for his role in leading the Indian Army to aid in the final days of the Indian Army&#x27;s support for the Bangladesh Liberation War against Pakistan. K. M. Cariappa was promoted in 1986, long after he retired, in recognition of his services as the first Indian Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army.

===Libya===

Khalifa Haftar was the first to &quot;claim&quot; receive this rank in Libya from the House of Representatives in 2016 after the liberation of oil ports in the Operation Swift Lightning.

=== Malaysia ===
Field Marshal of Malaysia is equivalent to general of the army of the United States which is the highest rank in the Malaysian army and are reserved for His Majesty the King of Malaysia though there are several non-royals who hold this rank.

===New Zealand===
Charles, Prince of Wales, as he was at the time, was officially appointed a Field Marshal in the New Zealand Army in November 2015. As King Charles III, he remains the only living person to hold the ranks of Field Marshal in the New Zealand Army, Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) and Marshal of the RNZAF. The King&#x27;s late father, the Duke of Edinburgh (1921–2021), also held these three ranks during his lifetime.

===Pakistan===

Ayub Khan (1907–1974) was the only field marshal in the history of Pakistan. He was the second president of Pakistan and the first native commander in chief of the army.

===Philippines===

US Army General Douglas MacArthur was the first and only field marshal in the history of the Philippine Army, a position he held while also acting as the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines with a rank of major general. President Quezon conferred the rank of field marshal on 24 August 1936 and MacArthur&#x27;s duty included the supervision of the creation of the Philippines nation-state.

===Portugal===

In the Portuguese Army, the rank of &quot;marechal de campo&quot; was created in 1762, as the most junior general officer rank. Hierarchically, it was ranked between &quot;tenente-general&quot; (lieutenant-general) and &quot;brigadeiro&quot; (brigadier), this last one not being considered a general rank, but a kind of senior colonel.

In Portugal, the ranks of &quot;marechal-general&quot; (marshal-general) and &quot;marechal do Exército&quot; (marechal of the Army) or simply &quot;marechal&quot; also existed. Distinctively from the rank of &quot;marechal de campo&quot;, the ranks of &quot;marechal-general&quot; and &quot;marechal&quot; were the highest in the Portuguese Army, usually being reserved for the commanders-in-chief of the Army. Latter, the rank of &quot;marechal-general&quot; became reserved for the monarch, as a mere honorary dignity.

===Romania===

&quot;Mareșal&quot; is the highest rank in the Romanian Armed Forces. The rank of &quot;mareșal&quot; can only be bestowed to a general or admiral (), in time of war for exceptional military merits, by the President of Romania and confirmed by the Supreme Council of National Defense.

===Russia/Soviet Union===

Imperial Russia had for a long time maintained the rank of Field Marshal. It was active all the way until the Russian Revolutions of 1917. When the Bolsheviks took over, they briefly abandoned military ranks until 1935. When it was restored, an equivalent rank Marshal of the Soviet Union was introduced in place of the Imperial Russian Army Field Marshal. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the rank was replaced by the Marshal of the Russian Federation. However, as of 2025, there has only been one Marshal of the Russian Federation.

===Serbia and Yugoslavia===

In Serbian, field marshal can be literally translated as . The closest equivalent of a five-star general in Serbia was Vojvoda (Serbia and Yugoslavia), a military rank that has many similarities compared to Generalfeldmarschall, Marshal of France and Field marshal (United Kingdom) but also differs in way of promotion, duration and style. However, the name of this military is etymologically closer to the nobility title of duke. It was the highest rank in the army of the Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Yugoslavia until the Second World War. It was first created with the passing of the law on the &quot;Organization of the Army&quot; of the Kingdom of Serbia in 1901. The law was passed on the suggestion of Lieutenant Colonel (later Divisional General) Miloš Vasić, who was minister of defense at the time. The rank was awarded only during the war for particular military contributions of top generals. Only four Serbian generals have reached the rank of Vojvoda, most notably Radomir Putnik.

Later Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army had the rank of Marshal of Yugoslavia used only by Josip Broz Tito as the supreme commander. This would actually be one rank above the rank of Field marshal and the equivalent of a six-star general, but it was essentially an honorific title with political connotations that became Tito&#x27;s best-known nickname.

=== South Africa ===

South African statesman and prime minister Jan Smuts was appointed a field marshal of the British Army on 24 May 1941.

=== South Korea ===
During the 2010s, the South Korean government tried to promote Paik Sun-yup to the rank of field marshal. However, the attempt failed because of his past service in the Manchukuo Imperial Army.

===Sri Lanka===

Field Marshal is the highest rank in the Sri Lanka Army. It is a ceremonial rank. Sarath Fonseka is the first and only Sri Lankan officer to hold the rank. He was promoted to the position on 22 March 2015.

=== Sweden ===
In Sweden, a total of 75 field marshals have been appointed, from 1609 to 1824. Since 1972, the rank has not been used in Sweden, and it had long been decided to only be used in wartime.

The title denoted the commander of the mounted part of the army. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the field marshal was subordinate to the country&#x27;s lieutenant general. In the Swedish army, the field marshal had unlimited military and considerable political authority. However, the field marshal was subordinate to the Lord High Constable of Sweden (Riksmarsken) and his closest man was the .

Initially, the field marshal was the commander of the cavalry and first became the foremost military rank in Sweden during the early 17th century, especially after count Jakob Pontusson de la Gardie received the rank.

=== Syria ===
Field Marshal () is the highest rank within the Syrian Army which is a ceremonial and honorary military rank, the only holder to-date is former President Bashar al-Assad who was promoted from Colonel. Its insignia is unique amongst Arab states, as the majority of Arab militaries that has a Field Marshal rank, the insignias has the national coat of arms or a crown above two crossed batons or swords surrounded by yellow leaves below, Syria&#x27;s Marshal rank adds an extra star to its General insignia ergo three stars above crossed swords below the coat of arms.

===Thailand===

In the Royal Thai Army the rank of &quot;Chom Phon&quot; () was created in 1888, together with all other military ranks along western lines, by King Chulalongkorn. Today it is ceremonially held by members of the Thai royal family.

===Turkey===

In the Turkish Armed Forces, the corresponding rank is &quot;mareşal&quot;. Its origins can be traced to the Ottoman Empire and to the military of Persia, where it was called &quot;müşir&quot; and bestowed upon senior commanders upon order of the ruling sultan. The rank of &quot;mareşal&quot; can only be bestowed by the National Assembly, to generals or admirals who have displayed distinguished merit in wartime. Only two persons have been bestowed the rank in history of the Republic: Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey, and his Chief of Staff Fevzi Çakmak, both for their successes in the Turkish War of Independence.

===Uganda===

Field Marshal Idi Amin was the military dictator and third president of Uganda from 1971 to 1979. Amin joined the British colonial regiment, the King&#x27;s African Rifles in 1946, serving in Somalia and Kenya. Eventually, Amin held the rank of major general in the post-colonial Ugandan Army and became its commander before seizing power in the military coup of January 1971, deposing Milton Obote. He later promoted himself to field marshal while he was the head of state.

===United Kingdom===

Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, was promoted to the rank of a field marshal (of multiple armies) in 1813. Nine of his field marshal batons are on display in Apsley House (see Batons of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington).

=== United States ===
No branch of the United States Armed Forces has ever used the rank of field marshal. On 14 December 1944, Congress created the rank of &quot;general of the army&quot;, a five-star rank equivalent to that of field marshal in other countries. Two days later, George Marshall was promoted to this rank, becoming the first five-star general in American history. It has been suggested that the denomination of &quot;Marshal&quot; for a five-star officer was not adopted because, otherwise, George Marshall would be addressed as &quot;Marshal Marshall&quot;, which was considered undignified. Thus, Douglas MacArthur is the only US officer ever to have received the rank of Marshal, which was given to him by the government of the Philippines.

<text>Edward Backhouse Eastwick CB (181416 July 1883, Ventnor, Isle of Wight) was an English orientalist, diplomat and Conservative Member of Parliament. He wrote and edited a number of books on South Asian countries. These included a Sindhi vocabulary and a grammar of the Hindustani language.

==Life and works==
Born a member of an Anglo-Indian family, he was educated at Charterhouse and at Merton College, Oxford. A brother was Captain William Joseph Eastwick. He joined the Bombay infantry in 1836, but, owing to his talent for languages, was soon given a political post. In 1843 he translated the Persian &quot;Kessahi Sanjan&quot;, or &quot;History of the Arrival of the Parsees in India&quot;; and he wrote a &quot;Life&quot; of Zoroaster, a Sindhi vocabulary, and various papers in the transactions of the Bombay Asiatic Society. Compelled by ill-health to return to Europe, he went to Frankfurt, where he learned German and translated Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Revolt of the Netherlands&quot; and Bopp&#x27;s &quot;Comparative Grammar&quot;.

In 1845 he was appointed professor of Hindustani at Haileybury College. Two years later he published a Hindustani grammar, and in subsequent years a new edition of Saadi&#x27;s &quot;Gulistán&quot;, with a translation in prose and verse, also an edition with vocabulary of the Hindi translation of Chatur Chuj Misr&#x27;s &quot;Prem Sagar&quot;, and translations of the &quot;Bagh-o-Bahar&quot;, and of the &quot;Anwar-i Suhaili&quot; of Bidpai. In 1851 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

In 1857–1858 he edited &quot;The Autobiography of Latfullah, A Mohamedan Gentleman&quot;. He also edited for the Bible Society the &quot;Book of Genesis&quot; in the Dakhani language. From 4 May 1860 to 1863 he was in Persia as secretary to the British Legation, publishing on his return &quot;The Journal of a Diplomate&#x27;s Three Years&#x27; Residence in Persia&quot;. In 1866 he became private secretary to the secretary of state for India, Lord Cranborne (afterwards marquess of Salisbury), and in 1867 went, as in 1864, on a government mission to Venezuela. He had meanwhile resigned his commission as a major in the London Rifle Volunteer Brigade in June 1861.

On his return Eastwick wrote, at the request of Charles Dickens, for &quot;All the Year Round&quot;, &quot;Sketches of Life in a South American Republic&quot;. From 1868 to 1874 he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Penryn and Falmouth. In 1875, he received the degree of MA with the franchise from the University of Oxford, &quot;as a slight recognition of distinguished services&quot;. At various times he wrote several of Murray&#x27;s Indian handbooks. His last work was the &quot;Kaisarnamah-i-Hind&quot; (&quot;The Lay of the Empress&quot;), in two volumes (1878–1882).

Eastwick died at Ventnor, Isle of Wight, on 16 July 1883, and was survived by his wife, Rosina Jane, daughter of James Hunter of Hapton House, Argyll, whom he had married in 1847 and by whom he had at least two children, Robert William Egerton Eastwick and Beatrice Heron-Maxwell.

<text>During the Italian Campaign of World War II, the Barbara Line was a series of German military fortifications in Italy, some south of the Gustav Line, from Colli al Volturno to the Adriatic Coast in San Salvo and a similar distance north of the Volturno Line. Near the eastern coast, it ran along the line of the Trigno river. The line mostly consisted of fortified hilltop positions. The line was broken by the allied army in November 1943 following which the Axis forces withdrew to the defensible positions of the Winter Line.

==Western breakthrough (U.S. Fifth Army front)==
&quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (Field marshal) Albert Kesselring—German commander-in-chief Italy—ordered his forces to retreat to the Barbara Line on 12 October 1943 after the U.S. Fifth Army crossed the Volturno River, breaching the Volturno defensive line.

By early November the Barbara Line on the Tyrrhenian Sea side of the Apennine Mountains had been breached by the U.S. Fifth Army, and the German Forces fell back to the Bernhardt Line.

==Eastern breakthrough (British Eighth Army front)==
The Allied Armies in Italy under General Sir Harold Alexander were fighting their way northward in Italy against determined German opposition skillfully directed by Albert Kesselring whose forces had prepared a succession of defensive lines. On the Adriatic front east of the Apennine Mountain spine was the British Eighth Army under General Bernard Montgomery. In October Eighth Army had crossed the Biferno river and the British Eighth Army had broken the Viktor/Volturno Line defences on 6 October. However, they had had to pause at the Trigno to re-group and reorganise their logistics along the poor roads stretching back to Bari and Taranto and respectively to the rear of the front. Delayed by these logistical problems, the Allies were not able to attack the next line of defences (the Barbara Line) behind the Trigno river immediately. It therefore was not until the early hours of 2 November that the V Corps on the right of the front on the coast and XIII Corps on their left attacked across the Trigno river.

On the V Corps front, British 78th Infantry Division attacked along the coastal road while 8th Indian Infantry Division attacked some inland. Fighting was fierce, but on 3 November, British 78th Division reached San Salvo, some three miles beyond the Trigno, at which point &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Rudolf Sieckenius—commanding 16th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division—decided to make a fighting withdrawal to the Sangro river and the formidable Gustav defensive positions overlooking the river from the ridge tops on the far side. Forward elements of Eighth Army moved to make contact with the forward defenses of the German Winter Line on the high ground north of the Sangro River. The Allies were able to move forward without opposition and the Allied advance reached the Sangro on 9 November.

<doc id="200365" wikidata="Q287568" url="?curid=200365" title="Garigliano">
<text>The Garigliano () is a river in central Italy.

It forms at the confluence of the rivers Gari (also known as the Rapido) and Liri. Garigliano is actually a deformation of &quot;Gari-Lirano&quot; (which in Italian means something like &quot;Gari from the Liri&quot;). In ancient times the whole course of the Liri and Garigliano was known as the &quot;Liris&quot;.

For the most part of its length, the Garigliano River marks the border between the Italian regions of Lazio and Campania. In medieval times, the river (then known as the &quot;Verde&quot;) marked the southern border of the Papal States.

==Historical significance==

Western Roman Emperor Majorian engaged a Vandal raiding party in battle at Garigliano in 457.

In the 9th and early 10th centuries, a band of Saracens established themselves on the banks of the river, from where they launched frequent raids on Campania and central Italy. In 915 a coalition of Pope John X, the Byzantines, Franks, Lombards, and Naples defeated the Garigliano Arabs in the Battle of Garigliano.

In 1503, Spanish and French forces fought another battle of Garigliano, in which Piero II de&#x27; Medici was drowned, thus control of the Medici family passed to Giovanni de&#x27; Medici, later Pope Leo X. The bigger French Army was practically destroyed at little cost to the Spanish, with the remnants later surrendering at Gaeta.
During the Italian Campaign of World War II, the Liri-Gari-Garigliano rivers stood at the centre of a system of German defensive lines (the most famous of which is the Gustav Line) around which the battle of Monte Cassino took place in 1943–1944. Rumours tell that the waters of the river ran red in the Cassino area during the famous battle, because of the blood of the many corpses of soldiers.

== Nuclear power plant ==

From 1959 until 1982 there was a BWR nuclear power plant named &quot;Garigliano&quot; near the town Sessa Aurunca.

<doc id="200366" wikidata="Q1285" url="?curid=200366" title="Apennine Mountains">
<text>The Apennines or Apennine Mountains ( ; or Ἀπέννινον ὄρος; or – a singular with plural meaning; ) are a mountain range consisting of parallel smaller chains extending the length of peninsular Italy. In the northwest they join the Ligurian Alps at Altare. In the southwest they end at Reggio di Calabria, the coastal city at the tip of the peninsula. Since 2000 the Environment Ministry of Italy, following the recommendations of the Apennines Park of Europe Project, has defined the Apennines System to include the mountains of north Sicily, a total distance of . The system forms an arc enclosing the east of the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian seas.

The Apennines conserve some intact ecosystems that have survived human intervention. In these are some of the best-preserved forests and montane grasslands in Europe, now protected by national parks and, within them, a high diversity of flora and fauna. These mountains are one of the last refuges of the big European predators such as the Italian wolf and the Marsican brown bear, now extinct in the rest of Central Europe.

The mountains lend their name to the Apennine peninsula that forms the major part of Italy. They are mostly verdant, although one side of the highest peak, Corno Grande, is partially covered by Calderone glacier, the only glacier in the Apennines. The eastern slopes down to the Adriatic Sea are steep, whilst the western slopes form foothills on which most of the towns of peninsular Italy are located. The mountains tend to be named after the province or provinces in which they are located; for example the Ligurian Apennines are in Liguria.

== Etymology ==
The etymology most frequently repeated, because of its semantic appropriateness, is that it derives from the Celtic &quot;penn&quot;, &#x27;mountain&#x27;, &#x27;summit&#x27;: which could have been assigned during the Celtic domination of north Italy in the 4th century BC or before. The name originally applied to the north Apennines. However historical linguists have never found a derivation with which they all agree. Wilhelm Deecke said: is doubtful but some derive it from the Ligurian-Celtish &quot;Pen&quot; or &quot;Ben&quot;, which means mountain peak.&quot;

A large number of place names seem to reflect &quot;pen&quot;: Penarrig, Penbrynn, Pencoid, Penmon, Pentir, etc. or &quot;ben&quot;: Beanach, Benmore, Benabuird, Benan, Bencruachan, etc. In one derivation &quot;Pen/Ben&quot; is cognate with Old Irish &quot;cenn&quot;, &#x27;head&#x27;, but an original &quot;*kwen-&quot; would be required, which is typologically not found in languages that feature labio-velars. Windisch and Brugmann reconstructed Indo-European &quot;*kwi-&quot;, deriving also the Greek Pindus Mountains from the same root, but &quot;*kwen-&quot; &lt; &quot;*kwi-&quot; is not explained by any rule. By some, English &quot;pin&quot;, as well as &quot;pen&quot; and Latin &quot;pinna&quot; or &quot;penna&quot;, &#x27;feather&#x27; (in the sense of the horn of the quill), have been connected to the name. This view has the word originating in Latium inconsistently with the theory of the northern origin. None of these derivations is accepted unquestionably.

== History ==

The Apennine culture is a technology complex in central and southern Italy from the Italian Middle Bronze Age (15th–14th centuries BC). In the mid-20th century the Apennine was divided into Proto-, Early, Middle and Late , but now archaeologists prefer to consider as &quot;Apennine&quot; only the ornamental pottery style of the later phase of Middle Bronze Age (BM3).

This phase is preceded by the Grotta Nuova facies (central Italy) and by the Protoapennine B facies (southern Italy) and succeeded by the Subapennine facies of 13th-century (&quot;Bronzo Recente&quot;). Apennine pottery is a burnished ware incised with spirals, meanders and geometrical zones, filled with dots or transverse dashes. It has been found on Ischia island in association with LHII and LHIII pottery and on Lipari in association with LHIIIA pottery, which associations date it to the Late Bronze Age as it is defined in Greece and the Aegean.

The people of the Apennine culture were alpine cattle herdsmen grazing their animals over the meadows and groves of mountainous central Italy. They lived in small hamlets located in defensible places. On the move between summer pastures they built temporary camps or lived in caves and rock shelters. Their range was not necessarily confined to the hills; their pottery has been found on the Capitoline Hill in Rome as well as on the islands mentioned above.

== Geography ==

The Apennines are divided into three sectors: northern (), central (), and 

A number of long hiking trails wind through the Apennines. Of note is European walking route E1 coming from northern Europe and traversing the lengths of the northern and central Apennines. The Grand Italian Trail begins in Trieste and after winding through the Alpine arc traverses the entire Apennine system, Sicily and Sardinia.

=== Northern Apennines ===
The northern Apennines consist of three s: the Ligurian (), Tuscan-Emilian (), and Umbrian Apennines ().

==== Ligurian Apennines ====

The Ligurian Apennines border the Ligurian Sea in the Gulf of Genoa, from about Savona below the upper Bormida River valley to about La Spezia (La Cisa pass) below the upper Magra River valley. The range follows the Gulf of Genoa separating it from the upper Po Valley. The northwestern border follows the line of the Bormida River to Acqui Terme. There the river continues northeast to Alessandria in the Po Valley, but the mountains bend away to the southeast.

The upper Bormida can be reached by a number of roads proceeding inland at a right angle to the coast southwest of Savona, the chief one being the Autostrada Torino-Savona. They ascend to the Bocchetta di Altare, sometimes called Colle di Cadibona, , the border between the Ligurian Alps along the coast to the west and the Ligurian Apennines. A bronze plaque fixed to a stone marks the top of the pass. In the vicinity are fragments of the old road and three ruins of former fortifications.
At Carcare, the main roads connect with the upper Bormida valley (Bormida di Mallare) before turning west. The Scrivia, the Trebbia and the Taro, tributaries of the Po River, drain the northeast slopes. The range contains dozens of peaks. Toward the southern end the Aveto Natural Regional Park includes Monte Penna. Nearby is the highest point of Ligurian Apennines, Monte Maggiorasca at .

The main and only feasible overland route connecting the coastal plain of Liguria to the north Italian plain runs through Bocchetta di Altare. It has always been of strategic importance. Defenders of north Italy have had to control it since ancient times, as the various fortifications placed there testify. Trenitalia, the state railway system, highly developed on the coastal plain, now traverses the mountains routinely through a number of railway tunnels, such as the one at Giovi Pass.

The southeastern border of the Ligurian Apennines is the Fiume Magra, which projects into the Tyrrhenian Sea south of La Spezia, and the Fiume Taro, which runs in the opposite direction to join the Po. The divide between the two upper river valleys is the Cisa Pass. Under it (in two tunnels) runs the Autostrada della Cisa between Spezia and Parma.

==== Tuscan–Emilian Apennines ====

Starting at Cisa Pass, the mountain chain turns further to the southeast, to cross the peninsula along the border between the Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany regions. They are named the Tuscan–Emilian Apennines west of the Futa Pass and the Tuscan–Romagnol Apennines east of it, or just the Tuscan Apennines. They extend to the upper Tiber River. The highest point is Monte Cimone at .

A separate branch, the Apuan Alps, goes southwest, bordering the coast south of La Spezia. Whether they are to be considered part of the Apennines is a matter of opinion; certainly, they are part of the Apennine System. Topographically only the valley of the River Serchio, which running parallel to the coast turns and exits into the Tyrrhenian Sea north of Pisa, separates the Apuan Alps from the Apennines; geologically the rock is of a slightly different composition, marble. The Roman marble industry was centered at Luna, and is now active in Carrara.

As the Tuscan Apennines divide the peninsula between the Po Valley and the plains and hills of Tuscany and Lazio, transportation over them has been used to achieve political and economic unity. Historically the Romans used the Via Flaminia between Rome and Rimini. The montane distance between Florence in Tuscany and Bologna in Emilia-Romagna is shorter, but exploitation of it required the conquest of more rugged terrain, which was not feasible for the ancients. Railway lines were constructed over the mountains in the early 19th century but they were of low capacity and unimprovable.

Since 1856, a series of tunnels have been constructed to conduct &quot;the Bologna-Florence rail line&quot;, which is neither a single line nor a single tunnel. The Porrettana Line went into service in 1864, the Direttissima in 1934 and the High Speed in 1996. A few dozen tunnels support the three of them, the longest on the High-Speed Line being the Voglia Tunnel at . The longest is on the Direttissima, the Great Apennine Tunnel, which at is the longest entirely within Italy, although the Simplon Tunnel, which connects Italy and Switzerland, is longer. Automobile traffic is carried by the Autostrada del Sole, Route A1, which goes through numerous shorter tunnels, bypassing an old road, originally Roman, through Futa Pass. In December 2015, a new Route A1 called Variante di Valico was opened after many years of construction consisting of major tunnels (the longest being the new &#x27;Tunel Base&#x27;) and new overpasses, shortening the traveling time between Florence and Bologna by road. The Foreste Casentinesi, Monte Falterona, Campigna National Park is in the southern part of the Tuscan–Romagnol Apennines. The southern limit of the Tuscan–Romagnol Apennines is the Bocca Serriola Pass in northern Umbria, which links Fano and Città di Castello.

The Tiber River at Rome flows from Monte Fumaiolo in the Tuscan-Romagnol Apennine from northeast to southwest, projecting into the Tyrrhenian Sea at right angles to the shore. The upper Tiber, however, flows from northwest to southeast, gradually turning through one right angle clockwise. The northern Tiber Valley is deep and separates the Apennines on the left bank from a lesser range, the Tuscan Anti-Apennines (Sub-Apennines) on its right.

=== Central Apennines ===
The Apennine System forms an irregular arc with centers of curvature located in the Tyrrhenian Sea. The northern and southern segments comprise parallel chains that can be viewed as single overall mountain ridges, such as the Ligurian Mountains. The center, being thicker and more complex, is geologically divided into an inner and an outer arc with regard to the centers of curvature. The geologic definition, however, is not the same as the geographic.

Based on rock type and orogenic incidents, the northern segment of the arc is divided into the Outer Northern Apennines (ONA) and the Inner Northern Apennines (INA). The Central Apennines are divided into the Umbrian–Marchean () or Roman Apennines in the north and the Abruzzi Apennines () in the south. It extends from Bocca Serriola pass in the north to Forlì pass in the south.

==== Umbria-Marche Apennines ====
The west border of the Umbria-Marche Apennines (or )) runs through Cagli. They extend south to the Tronto River, the south border of the ONA.
The highest peak, Monte Vettore, at , is part of the Monti Sibillini, incorporated into Parco Nazionale dei Monti Sibillini. Further north is the , in which are the Gola della Rossa (&quot;Red Gorge&quot;) and Frasassi Caves. Still further north is Parco Sasso Simone e Simoncello. The Italian Park Service calls it the &quot;green heart&quot; of Italy. The region is heavily forested, such as the Riserva Naturale Statale Gola del Furlo, where Furlo Pass on the Via Flaminia is located. Both the Etruscans and the Romans constructed tunnels here.

==== Abruzzi Apennines ====

The Abruzzi Apennines, located in Abruzzo, Molise and southeastern Lazio, contain the highest peaks and most rugged terrain of the Apennines. They are known in history as the territory of the Italic peoples first defeated by the city of Rome. Coincidentally they exist in three parallel folds or chains surviving from the orogeny. These extend in a northwest–southeast direction from the River Tronto to the River Sangro, which drain into the Adriatic. The coastal hills of the east extend between San Benedetto del Tronto in the north and Torino di Sangro in the south.

The eastern chain consists mainly of the southern part of the Monti Sibillini, the Monti della Laga, the Gran Sasso d&#x27;Italia Massif and the Majella Massif. Among them are two national parks: Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park and Majella National Park; and the Regional Park of the Monti Simbruini. Gran Sasso contains Corno Grande, the highest peak of the Apennines (2912 m).

Other features between the western and central ranges are the plain of Rieti, the valley of the Salto, and the Lago Fucino; while between the central and eastern ranges are the valleys of Aquila and Sulmona. The chief rivers on the west are the Nera, with its tributaries the Velino and Salto, and the Aniene, both of which fall into the Tiber. On the east there is at first a succession of small rivers which flow into the Adriatic, from which the highest points of the chain are some 20km distant, such as the Tronto, Tordino, Vomano and others. The Pescara, which receives the Aterno from the north-west and the Gizio from the south-east, is more important; and so is the Sangro.

The central Apennines are crossed by the railway from Rome to Pescara via Avezzano and Sulmona: the railway from Orte to Terni (and thence to Foligno) follows the Nera valley; while from Terni a line ascends to the plain of Rieti, and thence crosses the central chain to Aquila, whence it follows the valley of the Aterno to Sulmona. In ancient times the Via Salaria, Via Caecilia and Via Tiburtina all ran from Rome to the Adriatic coast. The volcanic mountains of the province of Rome are separated from the Apennines by the Tiber valley, and the Monti Lepini, part of the Volscian chain, by the valleys of the Sacco and Liri.

=== Southern Apennines ===
==== Samnite and Campanian Apennines ====

In the southern Apennines, to the south of the Sangro valley, the three parallel chains are broken up into smaller groups; among them may be named the Matese, the highest point of which is the Monte Miletto . The chief rivers on the south-west are the Liri or Garigliano with its tributary the Sacco, the Volturno, Sebeto, Sarno, on the north the Trigno, Biferno and Fortore.

Daunian mountains, in Apulia, are connected with the Apennine range, and so are Cilento mounts on the west. On the converse the promontory of Mount Gargano, on the east, is completely isolated, and so are the Campanian volcanic arc near Naples. The district is traversed from north-west to south-east by the railway from Sulmona to Benevento and on to Avellino, and from south-west to northeast by the railways from Caianello via Isernia to Campobasso and Termoli, from Caserta to Benevento and Foggia, and from Nocera Inferiore and Avellino to Rocchetta Sant&#x27;Antonio, the junction for Foggia, Spinazzola (for Barletta, Bari, and Taranto) and Potenza. Roman roads followed the same lines as the railways: the Via Appia ran from Capua to Benevento, whence the older road went to Venosa and Taranto and so to Brindisi, while the Via Traiana ran nearly to Troia (near Foggia) and thence to Bari.

==== Lucan Apennines ====
The valley of the Ofanto, which runs into the Adriatic close to Barletta, marks the northern termination of the first range of the Lucanian Apennines (now Basilicata), which runs from east to west, while south of the valleys of the Sele (on the west) and Basento (on the east)—which form the line followed by the railway from Battipaglia via Potenza to Metaponto—the second range begins to run due north and south as far as the plain of Sibari. The highest point is the Monte Pollino . The chief rivers are the Sele—joined by the Negro and Calore—on the west, and the Bradano, Basento, Agri, Sinni on the east, which flow into the gulf of Taranto; to the south of the last-named river there are only unimportant streams flowing into the sea east and west, inasmuch as here the width of the peninsula diminishes to some . The Cilento mountain range is the western part of the Lucan Appennines, as the Alburni and Eremita-Marzano mounts, part of the province of Salerno; Mount Cervati (1899 m) is the highest of this area.

==== Calabrian and Sicilian Apennines ====

The railway running south from Sicignano to Lagonegro, ascending the valley of the Negro, is planned to extend to Cosenza, along the line followed by the ancient Via Popilia, which beyond Cosenza reached the west coast at Terina and thence followed it to Reggio. The , a branch of the Via Traiana, ran from Aequum Tuticum to the ancient Nerulum. At the narrowest point the plain of Sibari, through which the rivers Coscile and Crati flow to the sea, occurs on the east coast, extending halfway across the peninsula. Here the limestone Apennines proper cease and the granite mountains of Calabria begin.

The first group extends as far as the isthmus formed by the gulfs of South Eufemia and Squillace; it is known as the Sila, and the highest point reached is (the Botte Donato). The forests which covered it in ancient times supplied the Greeks and Sicilians with timber for shipbuilding. The railway from South Eufemia to Catanzaro and Catanzaro Marina crosses the isthmus, and an ancient road may have run from Squillace to Monteleone. The second group extends to the south end of the Italian Peninsula, culminating in the Aspromonte () to the east of Reggio di Calabria. In both groups the rivers are quite unimportant. Finally, the Calabrian southern Apennine Mountains extend along the northern coast of Sicily (the Sicilian Apennines, Italian &quot;Appennino siculo&quot;)—Pizzo Carbonara () being the highest peak.

== Environment ==
=== Vegetative zones ===
==== Ecoregions ====

* north and central: Apennine deciduous montane forests (temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome)
* north through south: Italian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests (Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome)
* south: South Apennine mixed montane forests (also a Mediterranean biome)

The number of vascular plant species in the Apennines has been estimated at 5,599. Of these, 728 (23.6%) are in the treeline ecotone. Hemicryptophytes predominate in the entire Apennine chain.

==== Alpine zone ====
The tree line ecotone is mainly grasslands of the Montane grasslands and shrublands biome; with Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, and Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub below it. The tree line in the Apennines can be found in the range to . About 5% of the map area covered by the Apennines is at or above the tree line—or in the treeline ecotone. The snow line is at about , leaving the Apennines below it, except for the one remaining glacier. Snow may fall from October to May. Rainfall increases with latitude. The range&#x27;s climates, depending on elevation and latitude, are the Oceanic climate and Mediterranean climate.

=== Fauna ===


The mammal fauna is mainly composed of Italian wolves (endemic), Corsican hare, badgers, weasels, foxes, marmots, Etruscan shrew, Crested porcupine, European snow vole and Apennine shrews (endemic), Marsican brown bears (endemic), the European fallow deer, the European mouflon and the Pyrenean chamois.

There are also numerous birds such as the golden eagle, the Bonelli&#x27;s eagle, the Eurasian goshawk, the hoopoe, the hawk, the European roller, the White-backed woodpecker, the European green woodpecker, the Alpine chough, the Egyptian vulture, the European nightjar, the Italian sparrow (endemic) and the Eurasian eagle-owl

There are also numerous amphibians such as the Apennine yellow-bellied toad (endemic), the Italian cave salamander (endemic), the Italian newt (endemic), the Italian stream frog (endemic) and the Spectacled salamander (endemic), the Italian tree frog (endemic), the Agile frog, the Italian edible frog (endemic), the Common toad, the Balearic green toad, the Northern spectacled salamander (endemic), the Fire salamander, the Smooth newt, the Alpine newt, and the Italian crested newt.

The reptile fauna is mainly composed of suc as the Italian Aesculapian snake (endemic), the Dice snake, the Green whip snake, the Aesculapian snake, the Smooth snake, the Vipera ursinii, the Vipera aspis, the Italian wall lizard (endemic), the Podarcis muralis, the European green lizard.

Notable Apennine freshwater fishes are the Brook lamprey (endemic), Lombardy lamprey, Italian bleak (endemic), Horse barbel (endemic), Eurasian carp, Scardola scardafa (endemic), European perch, Chubius Chub, Tench and Northern pike.

The Italian wolf is the national animal of Italy, while the national bird of the country is the Italian sparrow. The reasons for this choice are related to the fact that the Italian wolf, which inhabits the Apennine Mountains and the Western Alps, features prominently in Latin and Italian cultures, such as in the legend of the founding of Rome.

=== Transhumance ===
In Italy the transhumance took place mainly starting from the Abruzzi Apennines, moving both towards the Tuscan and Lazio Maremma and above all towards the Tavoliere delle Puglie. The Apennines are to some extent covered with forests, though these were probably more extensive in classical times (Pliny mentions especially pine, oak and beech woods, &quot;Hist. Nat&quot;. xvi. 177); they have indeed been greatly reduced in comparatively modern times by indiscriminate timber-felling, and though serious attempts at reforestation have been made by the government, much remains to be done.

They also furnish considerable summer pastures, especially in the Abruzzi: Pliny (&quot;Hist. Nat&quot;. xi. 240) praises the cheese of the Apennines. In the forests Italian wolves were frequent, and still are found, the flocks being protected against them by large sheep-dogs; Marsican brown bears, however, which were known in Roman times, have almost entirely disappeared. Nor are the wild goats called &quot;rotae&quot;, spoken of by Marcus Terentius Varro (&quot;Rerum rusticarum&quot; II. i. 5), which may have been either Pyrenean chamois or steinbock, to be found.

Brigandage appears to have been prevalent in Roman times in the more remote parts of the Apennines, as it was until recently. An inscription found near the Furlo pass was set up in AD 246 by an &quot;evocatus Augusti&quot; (a member of a picked corps) on special police duty with a detachment of twenty men from the Ravenna fleet.

Snow lies on the highest peaks of the Apennines for almost the whole year. The range produces no minerals, but there are a considerable number of good mineral springs, some of which are thermal (such as Bagni di Lucca, Montecatini, Monsummano, Porretta, Telese), while others are cool (such as Nocera, Sangemini, Cinciano), the water of which is both drunk on the spot and sold as table water elsewhere.

=== National parks ===
The Apennines are home to twelve Italian national parks: the Appennino Tosco-Emiliano National Park, the Foreste Casentinesi, Monte Falterona, Campigna National Park, the Monti Sibillini National Park, the Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park, the Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise National Park, the Maiella National Park, the Pollino National Park, the Vesuvius National Park, the Cilento, Vallo di Diano and Alburni National Park, the Appennino Lucano - Val d&#x27;Agri - Lagonegrese National Park, the Sila National Park, the Aspromonte National Park.

=== Hydrography ===
Important rivers originate from the Apennines are the Panaro, the Secchia, the Reno, the Marecchia, the Rubicon, the Metauro, the Arno, the Tiber, the Savio, the Nera, the Velino, the Tronto, the Aterno-Pescara, the Aniene, the Liri, the Sangro and the Volturno. Among the lakes of glacial origin of the Alpine type is Lago di Pilato.

== Geology ==
The Apennines were created in the Apennine orogeny beginning in the early Neogene (about 20 mya, the middle Miocene) and continuing today. Geographically they are partially (or appear to be) continuous with the Alpine system. Prior to the explosion of data on the topic from about the year 2000, many authors took the approach that the Apennines had the same origin as the Alps. Even today, some authors use the term Alpine-Apennine system. They are not, however, the same system and did not have the same origin. The Alps were millions of years old before the Apennines rose from the sea.

The northward movement of the African Plate and its collision with the European Plate then caused the Alpine Orogeny, beginning in the late Mesozoic. The band of mountains created extends from Spain to Turkey in a roughly east–west direction and includes the Alps. The Apennines are much younger, extend from northwest to southeast, and are not a displacement of the Alpine chain.

The key evidence of the difference is the geologic behavior of the Po Valley in northern Italy. Compressional forces have been acting from north to south in the Alps and from south to north in the Apennines, but instead of being squeezed into mountains the valley has been subsiding at 1 to per year since about 25 mya, before the Apennines It is now known to be not an erosional feature, but is a filled portion of the Adriatic Trench, called the Adriatic foredeep after its function as a subduction zone was discovered.

=== Apennine orogeny ===
The Apennine orogeny is a type of mountain-building in which two simpler types are combined in an apparently paradoxical configuration. Sometimes this is referred to as &quot;syn-orogenic extension&quot;, but the term implies that the two processes occur simultaneously during time.
Some scientists imagine that this is relatively rare but not unique in mountain building, whereas others imagine that this is fairly common in all mountain belts.

The RETREAT Project have this specific feature as one of their focus points
In essence the east side of Italy features a fold and thrust belt raised by compressional forces acting under the Adriatic Sea. This side has been called the &quot;Apennine-Adriatic Compressional Zone&quot; or the &quot;Apennines Convergence Zone.&quot; On the west side of Italy fault-block mountains prevail, created by a spreading or extension of the crust under the Tyrrhenian Sea. This side is called the &quot;Tyrrhenian Extensional Zone.&quot; The mountains of Italy are of paradoxical provenience, having to derive from both compression and extension:
&quot;The paradox of how contraction and extension can occur simultaneously in convergent mountain belts remains a fundamental and largely unresolved problem in continental dynamics.&quot;Both the folded and the fault-block systems include parallel mountain chains. In the folded system anticlines erode into the highest and longest massifs of the Apennines.

According to the older theories (originating from the 1930s to 1970s) of Dutch geologists, including Van Bemmelen, compression and extension can and should occur simultaneously at different depths in a mountain belt. In these theories, these different levels are called &quot;Stockwerke&quot;. More recent work in geotectonics and geodynamics of the same school of geoscientists (Utrecht and Amsterdam University) by Vlaar, Wortel, and Cloetingh, and their disciples, extended these concepts even further into a temporal realm. They demonstrated that internal and external forces acting upon the mountain belt (e.g., slab pull and intra-plate stress field modulations due to large scale reorganisations of the tectonic plates) result in both longer episodes and shorter phases of general extension and compression acting both upon and inside mountain belts and tectonic arches (See e.g. for extensive reviews, bibliography and discussions on the literature:
Van Dijk (1992),
Van Dijk and Okkes (1991),
Van Dijk &amp; Scheepers (1995),
and Van Dijk et al. (2000a)).

==== Compressional zone ====
The gradual subsidence of the Po Valley (including that of Venice) and the folding of the mountains of eastern Italy have been investigated using seismic wave analysis of the &quot;Apennine Subduction System.&quot; Along the Adriatic side of Italy the floor of the Adriatic Sea, referred to as the &quot;Adriatic lithosphere&quot; or the &quot;Adriatic plate,&quot; terms whose precise meaning is the subject of ongoing research, is dipping under the slab on which the Apennines have been folded by compressional forces.

Subduction occurs along a fault, along which a hanging wall, or overriding slab is thrust over an overridden slab, also called the subducting slab. In north Italy the dip of this interface is 30° to 40° at a depth of 80–90km.

The strike of the Apennine subduction zone forms a long, irregular arc with centers of curvature in the Tyrrhenian Sea following the hanging wall over which the mountains have been raised; i.e., the eastern wall of the mountains. It runs from near the base of the Ligurian Apennines in the Po Valley along the margin of the mountains to the Adriatic, along the coastal deeps of the Adriatic shore, strikes inland at Monte Gargano cutting off Apulia, out to sea again through the Gulf of Taranto, widely around the rest of Italy and Sicily and across inland north Africa. The upper mantle above deep is broken into the &quot;Northern Apennines Arc&quot; and the &quot;Calabrian Arc&quot;, with compressional forces acting in different directions radially toward the arcs&#x27; centers of curvature.

==== Extensional zone ====
The west side of Italy is given to a fault-block system, where the crust – extended by the lengthening mantle below – thinned, broke along roughly parallel fault lines, and the blocks alternatively sank into grabens or were raised by isostasy into horsts. This system prevails from Corsica eastward to the valley of the Tiber River, the last rift valley in that direction. It runs approximately across the direction of extension. In the fault-block system, the ridges are lower and are more steep-sided, since the walls are formed by faults. Geographically they are not considered part of the Apennines proper but are termed Sub-Apennines () or Anti-Apennines () or Pre-Apennines (). These mountains are found mainly in Tuscany, Lazio and Campania.

=== Stability of terrain ===
The terrain of the Apennines (as well as that of the Alps) is to a large degree unstable due to various types of landslides, including falls and slides of rocks and debris, flows of earth and mud, and sink holes. The Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (), a government agency founded in 2008 by combining three older agencies, published in that year a special report, &quot;Landslides in Italy&quot;, summarizing the results of the IFFI Project (), the Italian Landslide Inventory (), an extensive survey of historical landslides in Italy undertaken by the government starting in 1997. By December 31, 2007, it had studied and mapped 482,272 landslides over . Its major statistics are the Landslide Index (LI here), the ratio of the landslide area to the total area of a region, the Landslide Index in Mountainous-Hilly Areas (here LIMH) and the Density of Landslides, which is the number per .

Italy as a whole has a LI of 6.8, a LIMH of 9.1 and a density of 160. Lombardia (LI of 13.9), Emilia-Romagna (11.4), Marches (19.4), Molise (14.0), Valle d&#x27;Aosta (16.0) and Piemonte (9.1) are significantly higher. The most unstable terrain in the Apennines when the landslide sites are plotted on the map are in order from most unstable the eastern flanks of the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines, the Central Apennines and the eastern flank of the southern Apennines. Instability there is comparable to the Alps bordering the Po Valley. The most stable terrain is on the western side: Liguria, Tuscany, Umbria and Lazio. The Apennines are slumping away to the northeast into the Po Valley and the Adriatic foredeep; that is, the zone where the Adriatic floor is being subducted under Italy. Slides with large translational or rotational surface movements are most common; e.g., a whole slope slumps into its valley, placing the population there at risk.

=== Glacial ice ===
Glaciers no longer exist in the Apennines outside the Gran Sasso d&#x27;Italia massif. However, post-Pliocene moraines have been observed in Basilicata.

== Major peaks ==
The Apennines include about 21 peaks over , the approximate tree line (counting only the top peak in each massif). Most of these peaks are located in the Central Apennines.

<text>The Bernhardt Line, or Reinhard Line, was a German Army defensive line in Italy during the Italian Campaign of World War II. Having reached the Bernhardt Line at the start of December 1943, it took until mid-January 1944 for the US Fifth Army to fight its way to the next line of defences, the Gustav Line. The Bernhardt Line was defended by XIV Panzer Corps (&quot;XIV Panzerkorps&quot;), part of the German Tenth Army (&quot;10. Armee&quot;).

Unlike most of the other defensive lines, the Bernhardt Line did not run all the way across Italy but was merely a bulge in front of the main Gustav Line; ran over the massif of Monte Cassino; and enclosed the peaks of Monte Cassino (Monastery Hill), Monte la Difensa, Monte la Remetanea and Monte Maggiore, in the territory of Rocca d&#x27;Evandro, and Monte Sambucaro (or Sammucro), which stands at the border of the three regions (Lazio, Molise, and Campania). However, the defences of the Gustav Line on the Adriatic are sometimes referred to as the Bernhardt Line, and the battles for that part of the line are included in this entry.

The Bernhardt Line was not as strong as the Gustav Line and was intended only to delay the Allies&#x27; arrival. Together with the Gustav Line and the Hitler Line, it made up the German Winter Line defences.

==Background==
Following the Allied invasion of Italy in September 1943, the Italian government had surrendered, but the German Army continued to fight. The Allied 15th Army Group, commanded by General Sir Harold Alexander, conquered southern Italy, but by early October, it had come up against the Volturno Line, the first of two lines (the next being the Barbara Line) was used to delay the Allied advance to buy time to prepare the most formidable defensive positions, which formed the Winter Line. Alexander had three possible alternatives to reach the Italian capital of Rome. On the Adriatic Front, he could advance to Pescara and then use Highway 5 (the old Roman Via Valeria) which traversed the country to Rome on the other coast. Alternatively, on the other side of the Apennines, Highway 7 (the old Roman Appian Way) followed along the west coast but south of Rome ran into the Pontine Marshes, which the Germans had flooded. Finally, Highway 6 ran in the same direction, but further inland, through the Liri Valley.

===Order of battle===
The German forces in Italy were commanded by Field Marshal (&quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;) Albert Kesselring. The defence of the Winter Line was the task of the German 10th Army (&quot;10. Armee&quot;) under the temporary command of Lieutenant-General (&quot;General der Panzertruppe&quot;) Joachim Lemelsen (in the absence of General (&quot;Generaloberst&quot;) Heinrich von Vietinghoff, who was in Germany on sick leave). The German 10th Army had Traugott Herr&#x27;s LXXVI Panzer Corps (&quot;LXXVI Panzerkorps&quot;) deployed on the eastern side of Italy, from the Apennine Mountains to the Adriatic, and Frido von Senger und Etterlin&#x27;s XIV Panzer Corps (&quot;XIV Panzerkorps&quot;) on the western side, from the mountains to the Tyrrhenian Sea.

The new Supreme Allied Commander of the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) was General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, replacing General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had moved to command of the Allied forces preparing for Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy. The Allied Armies in Italy (AAI), formerly designated the 15th Army Group, were commanded by General Alexander. Under his command were two field armies. To the left, on the western side of Italy, was the UD Fifth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark. To the right, on the eastern side, was the British Eighth Army, commanded by General Sir Bernard Montgomery. The Fifth Army consisted of American, British and French units. The Eighth Army, with British, Indian, New Zealand, Canadian and Polish units, was from early January 1944 commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Oliver Leese after General Montgomery was, along with General Eisenhower, also recalled to England to prepare for Operation Overlord.

==Eighth Army on Adriatic Winter Line defences==
===Prelude===
On 3 October, a battalion of the British Eighth Army&#x27;s 78th Infantry Division had crossed the Biferno river to confront the German Volturno-Viktor Line defences. Two Commando battalions landed from the sea north of the river at Termoli, and a fiercely contested battle ensued which had hung in the balance when a ford became unusable after heavy rains and prevented Allied armour from moving forward. However, the British infantry reinforced from the sea by two brigades, had held out long enough against the tanks of 16th Panzer Division (&quot;16. Panzerdivision&quot;) for a Bailey bridge to be laid across the river, and the crisis passed with the arrival of elements of 1st Canadian Armoured Brigades. By 6 October, the Germans were withdrawing to new defensive positions behind the Trigno River, the &quot;Barbara Line&quot;.

At the Trigno, the Eighth Army were obliged to pause because it had outrun its supply chain which stretched back over poor roads to the main ports of Bari and Taranto, and to its rear. Port and transport capacity had also been affected by the logistic requirements of the Allied air force, which was establishing a large number of strategic bomber bases around Foggia.

The Eighth Army attacked across the Trigno on 2 November. By the next day, the Germans&#x27; position had been turned, and they commenced a fighting withdrawal to the forward Winter Line positions that they were preparing on the ridges behind the Sangro River.

===Advance across the Sangro===

The Eighth Army&#x27;s forward units had reached the Sangro on 9 November. Alexander had planned for Montgomery to strike across the river on its coastal plain on 20 November with the V Corps (Indian 8th Infantry and 78th Infantry Divisions). In secrecy, Montgomery shifted the Indian division to the right to narrow the V Corps front and concentrate its power,sFfvF the newly arrived 2nd New Zealand Division into the gap. Eighth Army also devised a deception scheme involving false troop movements and ammunition dumps to give the impression that the main attack would be through the British XIII Corps front. The deception was to be maintained by an earlier diversionary attack some inland by XIII Corps and a secondary attack at the same time as V Corps some inland by the New Zealanders.

However, Kesselring guessed the Allies&#x27; intentions. On 18 November, Lemelsen had signaled Kesselring to the effect that the Allied concentrations on the coast led him to expect the main attack on his left wing. Then, heavy rain raised the river levels, which caused the postponement of the offensive to the night of 27 November and giving the Germans time to switch two divisions across the Apennines to the defending LXXVI &quot;Panzer&quot; Corps. That made three divisions on the coastal plain opposing V Corps: 65th Infantry Division (&quot;65. Infantriedivision&quot;), 90th Panzergrenadier Division (&quot;90. Panzergrenadierdivision&quot;) and 26th Panzer Division (&quot;26. Panzerdivision&quot;). 16th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division opposed the New Zealanders and the German 1st Parachute Division (&quot;1. Fallschirmjägerdivision&quot;) faced XIII Corps (1st Canadian Division and British 5th Infantry Division).

In the early hours of 28 November, the Eighth Army attack went in supported by heavy artillery concentrations. The New Zealanders advanced steadily. Although the German defences had been well prepared, most of the New Zealanders&#x27; objectives were manned by 65th Division which was poorly equipped and untried in battle. The German Division was also hampered by the fact that its commande, Brigadier-General (&quot;Generalmajor&quot;) G.H. von Ziehlberg, was severely wounded on the afternoon of 28 November. The 8th Indian Division, however, like the New Zealanders facing their first major combat action since arriving in Italy, experienced tougher opposition. Elements of 65th Infantry Division supported by an armoured battle group held tenaciously on to Mezzagrogna and the town was eventually taken on 29 November after tough, often hand to hand, fighting. On the morning of 29 November, 78th Infantry Division had joined the attack on the right of the Indian Division and had forced their way to Santa Maria by the evening, which created a base for their main attack the following day towards Fossacesia. By late on 30 November, 78th Division, supported by 4th Armoured Brigade, had taken Fossacesia and the whole ridge on the far bank of the Sangro. The main Bernhardt defences were under Eighth Army control.

As the Eighth Army pushed forward over the next few days, the 65th Infantry Division crumbled to the extent that German 10th Army were later to order a court-martial into its conduct. However, Herr introduced 90th Panzergrenadier Division into the line from his reserve and transferred reinforcements from the quieter sector inland in the form of elements of 1st Parachute Division. The complications of those manoeuvres introduced considerable confusion within the Germans&#x27; alignment, but they still managed a fighting withdrawal to the ridge on the far side of the Moro River. Unaware of the disorganisation in the German ranks, the New Zealanders failed on 2 December to exploit an opportunity to capture Orsogna, a key position near the headwaters of the Moro, which on that day was still only lightly held. It was only on the morning of 3 December that the New Zealand Division disputed possession of Orsogna, but the 26th &quot;Panzer&quot; had just enough breathing space to organise and repelled it. The 26th &quot;Panzer&quot; then proceeded to create a formidable defensive complex around the town and along the ridge towards Ortona on the coast, and Orsogna was not occupied by the Allies, despite a further two determined attempts during December, until the Germans withdrew after the Allied breakthrough at Monte Cassino in May 1944.

===Moro offensive===

Montgomery now rested the tired 78th Division, which had been leading the V Corps advance since the Volturno Line offensive, and swapped with the 1st Canadian Infantry Division from the relatively quiet XIII Corps sector. The Canadians, with the 8th Indian Infantry Division on their left, led the main thrust across the Moro on 8 December aiming for Ortona. By 20 December, after a stubborn resistance first from elements of the German 90th Panzergrenadier Division and then elements of the 1st Parachute Division, which had relieved the Panzergrenadier Division, the Canadians had patrols on the outskirts of the town. However, the Battle of Ortona took another week of fierce house-to-house fighting as the German 3rd Parachute Regiment tenaciously held on before it withdrew to the other side of the Riccio River on 28 December.

Meanwhile, inland V Corps, Orsogna had suffered three successive assaults, but XIII Corps spearheaded by the 2nd New Zealand Division, could not get past the defending 26th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division. After advancing a total of only 18 miles (29 km) and sustaining 6,500 casualties, blizzards, drifting snow and zero visibility in late December, jagged terrain caused Eighth Army&#x27;s offensive on the Adriatic front to grind to a halt. As the New Year approached, it became clear that with no prospect of better weather until the spring since the Eighth Army did not have the strength to force its way to Pescara. Alexander called a halt to the offensive and instructed Montgomery to maintain sufficient activity to pin LXXVI Panzer Corps and to prevent troops from being sent across to reinforce XIV Corps facing the Fifth Army.

The rest of the winter on the Adriatic front was spent in bitterly uncomfortable conditions with the opposing sides often in close proximity and engaged in night-time patrolling and vicious skirmishing.

==Fifth Army Bernhardt Line offensive==
It had taken Lieutenant General Mark Clark&#x27;s Fifth Army in deteriorating weather, as the torrential autumn rains broke, from mid-October to early November to fight their way across difficult terrain and through skillful and determined rearguard defences from the Volturno Line positions to the Bernhardt Line.

In the centre of the Fifth Army front lay the Mignano Gap, which, because of the marshy conditions on the coastal plain, represented the only realistic path to the mouth of the Liri Valley, the route to Rome.
Flanking and overlooking Highway 6 through the Mignano Gap and its villages (San Pietro Infine, San Vittore Del Lazio and Cervaro) are, successively, Monte Camino, Monte Lungo, Monte Porchia and Monte Trocchio on the left and Monte San Croce, Monte Corno, Monte Sambúcaro and Monte Maio on the right. Monte Sambúcaro normally appears as Monte Sammucro on Allied maps of the time. On reaching the Bernhardt positions, an immediate attack was launched by the 201st Guards Brigade, which was attached to the 56th (London) Infantry Division, part of Lieutenant-General Sir Richard McCreery&#x27;s British X Corps on Monte Camino on 6 November, which was beaten back by the 15th Panzergrenadier Division (&quot;15. Panzergrenadierdivision&quot;), with some 600 losses to the 201st Guards Brigade. By mid-November, it was clear that after having sustained 10,000 combat casualties since the Volturno Line offensive, the Fifth Army needed to pause, reorganise and regather its strength.

The Fifth Army resumed its attack on 1 December. The first attack, Operation Raincoat, was delivered after an intensive artillery and air bombardment, by the British X Corps on the left (comprising the 46th and 56th Infantry Divisions) and elements of the U.S. II Corps, commanded by Major General Geoffrey Keyes, including the 1st Special Service Force, under Lieutenant Colonel Robert T. Frederick, on the right against the formidable Camino hill mass. The dominating peak on Monte Camino, Hill 963, is crowned by a monastery. Two slightly lower peaks, Monte la Defensa, Monte la Difensa (Hill 960) as it appeared on the military maps during the war, and Monte la Remetanea (Hill 907), lie less than north of Camino. At the upper end of the Camino feature are the numerous peaks of Monte Maggiore. The entire hill mass is about long and four miles (6.5 km) wide. On the east and northeast, and the slopes rise steeply to the heightsamd then fall away gradually to the west toward the Garigliano River. It took until 9 December before the Camino mass was secured from the 15th Panzergrenadier Division.

Meanwhile, on the Fifth Army&#x27;s right flank, the US VI Corps, commanded by Major General John P. Lucas and composed of the 34th and 45th Infantry Divisions, had attacked into the mountains but made little progress until reinforced by the mountain troops of the French Expeditionary Corps (CEF), recently arrived in Italy; they attacked again on 15 December.

On 8 December the US 3rd and the 36th Infantry Divisions and the 1st Special Service Force of II Corps launched the attack on Monte Sambúcaro and into the Mignano Gap. By the night of 10 December, the peaks had been taken, which threatened the German positions in the gap. However, the German positions at San Pietro in the valley held firm until 16 December, when an attack launched from the Camino mass took Monte Lungo. The Germans could no longer expect to hold San Pietro when the dominating ground on both flanks, Monte Lungo and the Sambúcaro peaks, was in II Corps&#x27; possession. Under the cover of a counterattack, the German forces withdrew to positions about to their rear, in front of San Vittore. Several attacks were made in the next few days, and Morello Hill, overlooking the San Vittore positions from the north, was captured on 26 December.

On the US VI Corps front, progress was made but proved very difficult over the mountainous terrain as the weather deteriorated further with the onset of winter. In December, the Fifth Army suffered 5,020 wounded, but total admissions to hospital totaled 22,816, with jaundice, fevers and trench foot prevalent.

At the end of December, the Fifth Army had to pause once again to reorganise, replace its losses and gather itself for a final push to reach the Gustav Line defences. The US VI Corps was taken into reserve to train and prepare for the Anzio landings (codenamed Operation Shingle) with the French troops, by this time at corps strength, taking over their front.

The II Corps returned to the attack on 4 January 1944, with attacks parallel to Highway 6 north and south of it. The northern attack took San Vittore, and by 7 January the overlooking height of La Chiaia. On the south side, the attack was made from Monte Lungo and captured Monte Porchia. Meanwhile, on their left, the British X Corps had attacked from positions on the Camino mass to take on 8 January Cedro Hill, which with Monte Chiaia and Monte Porchia had formed a strong defensive line in front of Monte Trocchio.

The last offensive to clear the enemy in front of the Gustav defences started on 10 January. Cervaro was taken on 12 January and the overlooking hills to the north on 13 January. Thar opened up the northern flank of Monte Trocchio, and a heavy assault was planned for 15 January. However, the German XIV &quot;Panzer&quot; Corps considered the position to be untenable and withdrew across the Rapido. When the II Corps moved forward on 15 January, it hurts encountered no resistance.

==Air battle==
Even with the MAAF (Mediterranean Allied Air Forces) order going into effect on 20 December, the actions were the same as the days before. It would be on 1 January that operations would grind to a halt because of the official command changes. From 17 December to 15 January, the Allies also suffered very few scrubbed missions because of great weather, which permitted missions, unlike from November to December, when several days prevented any operational sorties by any air forces of the Allied forces.
From 17 December to 15 January, the period between the interdiction of the Bernhardt Line, allowed for an in-depth analysis for interdiction. The major targets included Rome, Pescara, Civitavecchia, Arezzo and Cassino. The area around Rome was often targeted by fighter bombers of the USAAF and RAF, and the towns of Arezzo and Civitavecchia, as well as the gun positions around the town, were also targeted by those fighter bombers. However, the railways in and around Pescara were targeted by Mediterranean Allied Tactical Air Force (MATAF) light and medium bombers. They were highly effective in damaging the marshalling yards and railways. 
At Cassino, both fighter bombers and medium bombers attacked and often tried to soften up the defences. That was especially common as the Fifth US Army approached the Rapido River near Cassino in early January to prepare for the first attack. Also, gun positions in the Mignano Gap and German troops on Mount Trocchio were also targeted on a handful of missions. Notably, the harbor facilities at Anzio were attacked as well.

Unofficially, Operation Strangle would begin on 15 January as the Bernhardt Line fell as a major air interdiction campaign. The MATAF took advantage of the moment to harass the retreating Germans by attacking them directly and also by severing their supply line in the world’s first major and intentional air interdiction campaign. The planning for Operation Strangle ensured that it would be delayed as the mechanics of air interdiction could be studied, and units prepared and used to that form of combat.

==Aftermath==
It had taken the Fifth Army six weeks of intense combat and 16,000 casualties to advance the 7 miles (11 km) through the Bernhardt Line defences, including the action at San Pietro Infine, to take Monte Trocchio and to reach the positions facing the main Gustav defences on 15 January.

<text>The Winter Line was a series of German and Italian military fortifications in Italy, constructed during World War II by Organisation Todt and commanded by Albert Kesselring. The series of three lines was designed to defend a western section of Italy, focused around the town of Monte Cassino, through which ran the important Highway 6 which led uninterrupted to Rome. The primary Gustav Line ran across Italy from just north of where the Garigliano River flows into the Tyrrhenian Sea in the west, through the Apennine Mountains to the mouth of the Sangro River on the Adriatic coast in the east. The two subsidiary lines, the Bernhardt Line and the Hitler Line, ran much shorter distances from the Tyrrehnian Sea to just northeast of Cassino where they would merge into the Gustav Line. Relative to the Gustav Line, the Hitler Line stood to the northwest and the Bernhardt Line to the southeast of the primary defenses.

Before being ultimately broken, the Gustav Line effectively slowed the Allied advance for months between December 1943 and June 1944. Major battles in the assault on the Winter Line at Monte Cassino and Anzio alone resulted in 98,000 Allied casualties and 60,000 Axis casualties.

==Gustav Line==
The Gustav Line stretched across the Italian Peninsula and barred the way to Rome for the two Allied armies in Italy: the U.S. Fifth Army in the west and the British Eighth Army in the east. The Allies&#x27; grand strategy in the autumn of 1943 was for the Eighth Army to advance through the Sangro River defences, then hook south at Avezzano and enter Rome from the rear while the Fifth Army approached from the south.

The center of the Gustav Line crossed the main route north to Rome at strategically crucial Highway 6. It followed the Liri valley and was anchored around the mountains behind the town of Cassino. Above it stood the ancient Benedictine sanctuary of Monte Cassino, which dominated the valley entrance, and Monte Cassino, which gave the defenders clear observation of potential attackers advancing towards the valley mouth. The U.S. 5th Army was held up in front of these positions through the winter of 1943-44. They attempted to flank the position by the landings at Anzio but bogged down quickly there. A bloody and protracted battle was waged over the monastery, known as the Battle of Monte Cassino.

The eastern end of the line was held by the coastal town of Ortona, captured by Canadian forces in the fierce Battle of Ortona in December 1943 which became known as &quot;the little Stalingrad.&quot; Failure by the 8th Army to capture Orsogna however put an end to the Allied plans of a strong drive up the eastern coast. Rain, flooded rivers, and high casualties, as well as the departure of General Montgomery, all put a halt to Allied plans until the spring of 1944. The Gustav Line thus fulfilled the wishes of Field Marshal Kesselring, the commander of German forces in Italy, of keeping the Allies south of the so-called Winter Line.

==Bernhardt and Hitler Lines==
On the western side of the Apennines were two subsidiary lines, the Bernhardt Line in front of the main Gustav positions, and the Hitler Line some 8 kilometres (5 mi) to the rear. The Winter Line was fortified with gun pits, concrete bunkers, turreted machine-gun emplacements, barbed wire and minefields. It was the strongest of the German defensive lines south of Rome. About 15 German divisions were employed in the defence. It took the Allies from mid-November 1943 to June 1944 to fight through all the various elements of the Winter Line, including the well-known battles at Monte Cassino and Anzio.

The offensive on the Bernhardt Line was launched on December 1, 1943, as part of Operation Raincoat. British and American troops took the terrain around Monte Camino and the Mignano Gap within a week and a half of launching the assault but German operations persisted in the area for months.

Some authorities define the Bernhardt Line as crossing Italy from coast to coast following not just the western defensive positions described above but incorporating also the eastern defences of the Gustav Line. Other authorities use the Winter Line name interchangeably with the Gustav Line .

<text>Henry Thomas Colebrooke FRS FRSE FLS (15 June 1765 – 10 March 1837) was an English orientalist and botanist. He has been described as &quot;the first great Sanskrit scholar in Europe&quot;.

==Biography==
Henry Thomas Colebrooke was born on 15 June 1765. His parents were Sir George Colebrooke, 2nd Baronet, MP for Arundel and Chairman of the East India Company from 1769, and Mary Gaynor, daughter and heir of Patrick Gaynor of Antigua. He was educated at home, and from the age of
twelve to sixteen he lived in France.

In 1782 Colebrooke was appointed through his father&#x27;s influence to a writership with the East India Company in Calcutta. In 1786 and three years later he was appointed assistant collector in the revenue department at Tirhut. He wrote &quot;Remarks on the Husbandry and Commerce of Bengal&quot;, which was privately published in 1795, by which time he had transferred to Purnia. This opposed the East India Company&#x27;s monopoly on Indian trade, advocating instead for free trade between Britain and India, which caused offence to the East India Company&#x27;s governors.

He was appointed to the magistracy of Mirzapur in 1795 and was sent to Nagpur in 1799 to negotiate an allowance with the Raja of Berar. He was unsuccessful in this, due to events elsewhere, and returned in 1801.
On his return was made a judge of the new court of appeal in Calcutta, of which he became president of the bench in 1805. Also in 1805, Lord Wellesley appointed him honorary professor of Hindu law and Sanskrit at the college of Fort William. In 1807 he became a member of council, serving for five years, and was elected President of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta. Colebrooke married Elizabeth Wilkinson in 1810. The marriage was short-lived and she died in 1814. He returned to England in 1815.

In 1816 he was elected to the fellowship of both the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Edinburgh In 1820 he was a founder of the Royal Astronomical Society. He often chaired the society&#x27;s meetings in the absence of the first president, William Herschel, and was elected as its second president on Herschel&#x27;s death, serving 1823–1825. In 1823 he was also a founder of the Royal Asiatic Society, chairing its first meeting although he declined to become its president.

==Works==
After eleven years of residence in India, Colebrooke began the study of the Sanskrit language; and to him was entrusted the translation of the major &quot;Digest of Hindu Laws&quot;, a monumental study of Hindu law which had been left unfinished by Sir William Jones. He translated the two treatises, the &quot;Mitacshara&quot; of Vijnaneshwara and the &quot;Dayabhaga&quot; of Jimutavahana, under the title &quot;Law of Inheritance&quot;. During his residence at Calcutta he wrote his &quot;Sanskrit Grammar&quot; (1805), some papers on the religious ceremonies of the Hindus, and his &quot;Essay on the Vedas&quot; (1805), for a long time the standard work in English on the subject. A posthumous essay on his father&#x27;s life was published by Sir T. E. Colebrooke in 1873 as part of a reprinting of &quot;Miscellaneous Essays&quot;.

He collected plants in the Sylhet Division and sent plants and drawings to William Jackson Hooker and Aylmer Bourke Lambert. Colebrooke&#x27;s botanical specimens are stored at Kew Gardens.

<text>The Sangro is a river in eastern central Italy, known in ancient times as Sagrus from the Greek &quot;Sagros&quot; or &quot;Isagros&quot;, &quot;Ισαγρος&quot;.

It rises in the middle of Abruzzo National Park near Pescasseroli in the Apennine Mountains. It flows southeast past Pescasseroli, Opi and Villetta Barrea and flows into the artificial lake Lago di Barrea. Likewise, it then flows northeast through Alfedena, Castel di Sangro, Ateleta, Quadri, and Villa Santa Maria, before flowing into the Lago di Bomba. From there it flows northeast , it is joined by the Aventino, and thence it flows into the Adriatic Sea south of Punta Cavalluccio.
During World War II, the mouth of the Sangro was part of the series of German military fortifications known as the Gustav Line. The Eighth Army crossed the Sangro on 23 November 1943. This crossing was the beginning of the Allied offensive on the Winter Line defences east of the Apennines, which petered out in mid-December, having failed to secure vital cities such as Orsogna.

<doc id="200382" wikidata="Q1129380" url="?curid=200382" title="Alban Hills">
<text>The Alban Hills () are the caldera remains of a quiescent volcanic complex in Italy, located southeast of Rome and about north of Anzio. The high Monte Cavo forms a highly visible peak in the centre of the caldera, but the highest point is Maschio delle Faete approximately to the east of Cavo and taller. There are subsidiary calderas along the rim of the Alban Hills that contain the lakes Albano and Nemi. The hills are composed of peperino (lapis albanus), a variety of tuff that is useful for construction and provides a mineral-rich substrate for nearby vineyards.

==History==
The hills, especially around the shores of the lakes, have been popular since prehistoric times. From the 9th to 7th century BC, there were numerous villages (see the legendary Alba Longa and Tusculum). The area was inhabited by the Latini during the 5th to 3rd centuries BC.

The ancient Romans called Monte Cavo Albanus Mons. On the summit was the sanctuary of Jupiter Latiaris, in which the consuls celebrated the &quot;Feriae Latinae&quot;, and several generals celebrated victories here during times when they were not accorded regular triumphs in Rome. The foundations and some of the architectural fragments of the temple were still in existence until 1777, when they were used to build the Passionist monastery by Cardinal York, but the &quot;Via Triumphalis&quot; leading up to it can still be seen.

In Roman times, the area was often used by the rich as a way to escape the heat and crowds of Rome, as it is today as shown by the many villas and country houses present.

==Towns and cities==

The towns and villages in the Alban Hills are known as the Castelli Romani.

==Volcanic activity==
Examination of deposits have dated the four most recent eruptions to two temporal peaks, around 36,000 and 39,000 years ago. The area exhibits small localised earthquake swarms, bradyseism, and release of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide into the atmosphere. The uplift and earthquake swarms have been interpreted as caused by a slowly growing spherical magma chamber 5-6 kilometres below the surface; some think that it may erupt again; if so, there is risk to Rome, which is only 25 to 30 km away.

There is documentary evidence which may describe an eruption in 114 BC, but the absence of Holocene geological deposits has largely discredited it as a volcanic event and instead the account is considered to be a description of a forest fire.

The volcano emits large amounts of carbon dioxide which can potentially reach lethal concentrations if it accumulates in depressions in the ground in the absence of wind. The asphyxiation of 29 cows in September 1999 prompted a detailed survey, which found that concentration of the gas at 1.5 m above the ground in a residential area on the northwestern flank sometimes exceeded the occupational health threshold of 0.5%. Eight sheep were killed in a similar incident in October 2001.

<text>Anzio (, ; ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; on region of Italy, about south of Rome.

Well known for its seaside resorts, it is a fishing port and a departure point for ferries and hydroplanes to the Pontine Islands of Ponza, Palmarola, and Ventotene. The town bears great historical significance as the site of Operation Shingle, a crucial landing by the Allies during the Italian Campaign of World War II.

== History ==
=== Legacy of Antium ===

The symbol of Anzio is the goddess Fortuna, in reference to her veneration in the ancient Antium, whose territory Anzio occupies a very important part; so that it retains the heritage of the ancient town in archaeological terms: the settlement of Antium, over the centuries, was certainly present in the area of modern Anzio (the Capo d&#x27;Anzio).

In the Roman era the territory of Antium almost entirely corresponded to modern Anzio and nearby Nettuno.

In the Middle Ages Antium was deserted in favour of Nettuno, which maintained the legacy of the ancient settlement.

=== Modern Era ===

At the end of the sixteenth century Pope Clement VIII, who had purchased the lordship over Nettuno (the territory of which incorporated Anzio ) for the Apostolic Chamber, gave instructions to Monsignor Bartolomeo Cesi to take steps to safeguard the building heritage of Anzio. A century later, in the last decade of the seventeenth century, by the will of Pope Innocent XII the port was rebuilt which gave rise to a notable economic recovery in the area, which continued throughout the eighteenth century. At the end of the 17th century Innocent XII and Clement XI restored the harbour, not on the old site of the Roman one of Nero, but to the east of it, with the opening to the east, a mistake which leads to its being frequently silted up; it has a depth of about . The sea is encroaching slightly at Anzio, but some kilometres farther north-west the old Roman coast-line now lies slightly inland (see Tiber). 

A village arose and developed after the construction of the new harbour - completed in 1700 - with the Roman aristocracy discovering the area. 

In 1857 Pope Pius IX founded the modern municipality (&quot;comune&quot;) of Anzio, with the boundaries of Nettuno being redrawn to accommodate the new town; however, the official name of the new municipality was Porto d&#x27;Anzio until 1885.

Anzio knew a remarkable development as a seaside resort at the end of the 19th century.

In 1925, Anzio became one of the central places of the telecommunication revolution. On 16 March 1925, the &quot;Station&quot; of the submarine telegraph cable was inaugurated in Anzio, the first telecommunication cable connected directly from Anzio to New York. The following submarine telegraph cable united Italy with Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay through this &quot;Station&quot; in Anzio.

==== World War II ====

From 1940 to 1945 Anzio was united with Nettuno in a single municipality (&quot;comune&quot;): Nettunia.

Anzio and Nettuno are also notable as sites of an Allied forces landing and the ensuing Battle of Anzio during World War II. The Commonwealth Anzio War Cemetery and Beach Head War Cemetery are located here.

In February 1944 American soldiers (the U.S. Fifth Army) were surrounded by Germans in the caves of Pozzoli for a week, suffering heavy casualties. A film based on the events called &quot;Anzio&quot; (1968, directed by Edward Dmytryk) was made, starring Robert Mitchum and based on a book by Wynford Vaughan-Thomas.

On 18 February 1944, the British light cruiser was struck by two torpedoes off the coast of Anzio and sunk with a loss of 417 crew.

In the same region Lieutenant Eric Fletcher Waters of the British Army lost his life in battle while serving as a member of the 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment), part of the 167th (London) Infantry Brigade of the 56th (London) Infantry Division which fought at Anzio for nearly six weeks. His son, Roger Waters, became the bassist and main lyricist of progressive rock band, Pink Floyd. In his honour and remembrance Roger Waters recorded the song &quot;The Fletcher Memorial Home&quot;, which is the maiden name of Eric Waters&#x27; mother. (Also see &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot;.)

====Post-war====
On September 14, 1948, a waterspout came ashore in the town, which threw a mobile home and threw a car “violently” into a tree. This tornado never received an official rating from the European Severe Storms Laboratory, however, the La Stampa newspaper wrote an article how it was “exceptionally violent”. According to La Stampa, a wooden and brick home was completely destroyed, ten homes had their roofs completely torn off, and about 50 large pine trees were completely uprooted. The tornado caused several million lire in damage.

== Main sights ==
Along the coast are numerous remains of Roman villas. One, the &quot;Domus Neroniana&quot;, has been identified as a residence of Nero (the villa was subsequently enlarged by Domitian, Hadrian and Septimius Severus); he and Caligula were born in Antium and, according to Giuseppe Lugli, right there (&quot;one or more villas of the Julia gens&quot;). There are also the ruins of the villa of Cicero.

In Anzio can be found the Anzio War Cemetery, located close to the Communal Cemetery and Beachhead Museum. The Beach Head War Cemetery is located 5-kilometre north on No207 Road.
The Sicily-Rome American Cemetery and Memorial is in nearby Nettuno.

About north of the town there is a WWF park with sulphur springs and a medieval tower, Tor Caldara.

Near the ruins of the Villa of Nero, in scenic position near the beach, lies the military sanatorium of the Italian Army, one of the most important works of Florestano Di Fausto, built-in 1930–1933.

All along the coast a large number of beaches and sea resorts can be found, including hotels and the famous fish restaurants of the port of Anzio. The town once hosted a Casino called Paradiso sul mare, that is no longer active and now hosts cultural events. In the southern part of Anzio, close to the border with Nettuno, are many Italian Art Nouveau style houses.

== Transportation ==
The town is connected to Rome by the Via Nettunense (SS207), the Via Ardeatina (SS601) and by the Roma-Nettuno railway that connects Anzio with Roma Termini in around 1 hour. The railway line also stops in the stations of Padiglione, Lido di Lavinio, Villa Claudia, Marechiaro, Anzio Colonia to the north of Anzio.

Ferries and hydrofoils connect Anzio to Ponza.

<text>Albert Kesselring (30 November 1885 – 16 July 1960) was a German military officer and convicted war criminal who served in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during World War II. In a career which spanned both world wars, Kesselring reached the rank of the (Field marshal) and became one of Nazi Germany&#x27;s most highly decorated commanders.

Kesselring joined the Bavarian Army as an officer cadet in 1904, serving in the artillery branch. He completed training as a balloon observer in 1912. During World War I, he served on both the Western and Eastern fronts and was posted to the Army Staff, despite not having attended the War Academy. Kesselring served in the after the war, but was discharged in 1933 to become head of the Department of Administration at the Ministry of Aviation, where he became involved in the re-establishment of the German aviation industry and the laying of the foundations for the , serving as its chief of staff from 1936 to 1938.

During World War II, he commanded forces in the German invasions of Poland and France, the Battle of Britain and the invasion of the Soviet Union. As Commander-in-Chief South, he was the overall German commander in the Mediterranean theatre, which included the North African campaign. Kesselring conducted a defensive campaign against Allied forces in Italy, being involved in ordering several massacres, until he was injured in an accident in October 1944. In his final campaign of the war, he commanded German forces on the Western Front. During the war, he won the respect of his Allied opponents for his military accomplishments.

After the war, Kesselring was convicted of war crimes and sentenced to death for ordering the murder of 335 Italian civilians in the Ardeatine massacre, and for inciting and ordering his troops to kill civilians as part of reprisals against the Italian resistance movement. The sentence was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment. A political and media campaign resulted in his release in 1952, ostensibly on health grounds. He published his memoirs, (&quot;A Soldier to the Last Day&quot;), in 1953. Kesselring accepted the honorary presidency of three veterans&#x27; organisations: the , consisting of veterans; the , the veterans&#x27; association of the Afrika Korps; and, most controversially, the right-wing before dying in 1960.

==Early life==
Albert Kesselring was born in Marktsteft, Bavaria, on 30 November 1885, the son of Carl Adolf Kesselring, a schoolmaster and town councillor, and his wife Rosina, Carl&#x27;s second cousin. Albert&#x27;s early years were spent in Marktsteft, where relatives had operated a brewery since 1688.

Graduating from the Christian Ernestinum Secondary School in Bayreuth in 1904, Kesselring joined the German Army as a (officer cadet) in the 2nd Bavarian Foot Artillery Regiment. The regiment was based at Metz and was responsible for maintaining its forts. He remained with the regiment until 1915, except for periods at the Military Academy from 1905 to 1906, after which he received his commission as a (lieutenant), and at the School of Artillery and Engineering in Munich from 1909 to 1910.

In 1910, Kesselring married Luise Anna Pauline (Liny) Keyssler, the daughter of an apothecary from Bayreuth. Their marriage was childless, but in 1913 they adopted Rainer, the son of Albert&#x27;s second cousin Kurt Kesselring. In 1912, Kesselring completed training as a balloon observer in a dirigible section—an early sign of an interest in aviation. Kesselring&#x27;s superiors considered posting him to the School of Artillery and Engineering as an instructor because of his expertise in &quot;the interplay between tactics and technology&quot;.

==World War I==
During World War I, Kesselring served with his regiment in Lorraine until the end of 1914, when he was transferred to the 1st Bavarian Foot Artillery, which formed part of the Sixth Army. On 19 May 1916, he was promoted to (captain). In 1916 he was transferred again, to the 3rd Bavarian Foot Artillery. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Arras in 1917, &quot;by his tireless and assiduous work, and by the preparation of clear and carefully constructed orders&quot;, despite being on duty for over twenty hours, and succeeded in halting the British advance. For his services on the Western Front, he was decorated with the Iron Cross, 1st Class.

In 1917, he was posted to the General Staff, despite not having attended the Bavarian War Academy. He served on the Eastern Front on the staff of the 2nd Bavarian Landwehr Division. His experience here shaped his subsequent anti-communist political outlook. In January 1918, he returned to the Western Front as a staff officer with the II and III Royal Bavarian Corps.

==Between the wars==
===&quot;Reichswehr&quot;===
After the war, Kesselring was involved in the demobilisation of III Royal Bavarian Corps in the Nuremberg area, as mandated by the Treaty of Versailles. A dispute with the leader of the local right-wing paramilitary led to the issuance of an arrest warrant for his alleged involvement in a against the command of III Bavarian Corps, and Kesselring was thrown into prison. He was soon released, but his superior, Major Hans Seyler, censured him for having &quot;failed to display the requisite discretion&quot;.

From 1919 to 1922, Kesselring served as a battery commander with the 24th Artillery Regiment. He joined the on 1 October 1922 and was posted to the Military Training Department at the Ministry of the Reichswehr in Berlin. He remained at this post until 1929 when he returned to Bavaria as commander of Wehrkreis VII in Munich. In his time with the Ministry, Kesselring was involved in the organisation of the army, trimming staff overheads to produce the best possible army with the limited resources available. He helped re-organise the Ordnance Department, laying the groundwork for the research and development efforts that would produce new weapons. He was involved in secret military manoeuvres held in the Soviet Union in 1924 and the so-called Great Plan for a 102-division army, which was prepared in 1923 and 1924. Following the recommendation of a commission headed by Kesselring in 1929, aviation officers and agencies were consolidated into an inspectorate of aviation. After another brief stint at the Ministry of the , Kesselring was promoted to (lieutenant colonel) in 1930 and spent two years in Dresden with the 4th Artillery Regiment.

===&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;===
Kesselring was discharged from the in 1933 against his wishes, and appointed head of the Department of Administration at the Reich Commissariat for Aviation (), the forerunner of the Reich Air Ministry () (RLM), with the rank of (colonel) in 1934. Since the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany from establishing an air force, this was nominally a civilian agency. The was not formally established until 26 February 1935. He was involved in the re-establishment of the aviation industry and the construction of secret factories, forging alliances with industrialists and aviation engineers.

Promotion in the was rapid; Kesselring was promoted to on 1 October 1934, and on 1 April 1936. Like other generals of Nazi Germany, he received personal monthly payments from Adolf Hitler, in Kesselring&#x27;s case , a considerable sum at the time.
At the age of 48, Kesselring learned to fly, following the old military doctrine that officers should not ask their men to do anything they would not do themselves. He later stated that first-hand knowledge of all aspects of aviation was essential to being able to command airmen, although he was well aware that latecomers like himself did not impress the old pioneers or the young aviators. He qualified in various single- and multi-engine aircraft and continued flying three or four days per week until March 1945.

Following the death of Walther Wever in an air crash, Kesselring became Chief of Staff of the on 3 June 1936. In that post, he oversaw the expansion of the Luftwaffe, the acquisition of new aircraft types such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter and Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive-bomber, and the development of paratroops.

Kesselring&#x27;s main operational task during this time was the support of the Condor Legion in the Spanish Civil War. His tenure was marred by personal and professional conflicts with his superior, Erhard Milch, and Kesselring asked to be relieved. His conflict with Milch was in contrast to his predecessor, Wever. Overall it has been surmised that Kesselring was not an effective chief of staff, primarily because he lacked Wever&#x27;s strategic insight. Kesselring requested a transfer to a field command, and the head of the , Hermann Göring, gave him command of (Air District III) in Dresden. Kesselring was promoted to in 1937, and became commander of in 1938, until January 1940. He was succeeded in his role by Hans-Jürgen Stumpff.

===Impact on Luftwaffe doctrine===
In the area of aerial doctrine, Kesselring has been described by James Corum as a &quot;worthy successor&quot; to Wever. Like many ex-Army officers, Kesselring saw the importance of air power in the tactical role, providing support to land operations. In the historiography of the Luftwaffe, Kesselring and Hans-Jürgen Stumpff are usually blamed for neglecting strategic bombing while over-focusing on close air support for the army. However, the two most prominent enthusiasts for the focus on ground-support operations (either close air support or air interdiction) were Hugo Sperrle and Hans Jeschonnek. These men were long-time professional airmen involved in German air services since their early careers.

Kesselring strongly supported the program to produce a long-range heavy bomber. As chief of staff he supported new technologies and training for bomb aimers and navigators to carry out effective long-range bombing missions and at high altitudes. In March 1939 Kesselring expressed his doubt this could be done accurately at night or in bad weather. German scientists succeeded in proving otherwise, and developed a successful radio navigation system.

The Luftwaffe was not pressured into ground support operations due to demands from the army, or because it was led by ex-army personnel. Interdiction and close air support were operations that suited the Luftwaffe&#x27;s existing approach to warfare: a culture of joint inter-service operations rather than independent strategic air campaigns. Moreover, many officers in the Luftwaffe command believed medium bombers to be sufficient in power for use in strategic bombing operations against Germany&#x27;s most likely enemies; Britain and France. The cancellation of Wever&#x27;s long-range Ural bomber project in April 1937 was opposed by Kesselring. On 2 June the RLM relented and ordered a better-performing design, which became the Heinkel He 177. The project took shape as Kesselring left office.

==World War II==
===Poland===
In the Polish campaign that began World War II, Kesselring&#x27;s operated in support of Army Group North, commanded by Fedor von Bock. Kesselring had 1,105 aircraft in comparison to Alexander Löhr&#x27;s 729 with in support of Gerd von Rundstedt&#x27;s Army Group South. Kesselring gave a high priority to attacks on airfields. Strategic targets like aircraft and aircraft-related armament factories were attacked during the air superiority mission and formed part of it. Once the air battle was won, only then did the direct its attention to close air support and air interdiction.

The tactical and operational focus of the in the first days of the campaign was not a repudiation of strategic bombardment. The planned strategic bombing of Warsaw (Operation ), scheduled to commence on 1 September, was postponed due to bad weather. By the time the weather cleared, the army support operations were going so well there was a reluctance to shift emphasis.

The had difficulty locating the dispersed Polish airfields, and only 24 Polish aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The counter-air campaign was not as successful as it may have been due to faulty fuses on bombs–a lesson soon rectified. Air superiority was accomplished by destroying communications, which increased the pace of the army advance and enabled ground forces to overrun Polish airstrips and early warning sites. Sporadic Polish aerial resistance continued until 14 September. The Polish Air Force earned Kesselring&#x27;s respect and he considered that Polish pilots and aircraft were not inferior. Kesselring himself was shot down during the campaign, the first of the five times he was shot down during World War II.

Although not under Bock&#x27;s command, Kesselring&#x27;s purpose was to support Army Group North in closing the Polish Corridor from the third day, with emphasis thereafter on supporting the 3rd Army as it advanced along the Vistula to isolate Warsaw from the east. From 8 September Kesselring began interdiction operations against bridges as German forces advanced on Warsaw. When a powerful Polish counter-attack created a crisis, he contributed to the Battle of the Bzura. The division contained 70 per cent of his dive-bombers and was assigned to Löhr on 6 September. The air attacks assisted in the destruction of two Polish armies.

On 16/17 September the air fleets were notified of the Soviet invasion of Poland. support operations against troop concentrations ceased in central and southern Poland to avoid friendly-fire incidents. Kesselring attempted to crush Polish resistance by making a series of air attacks against Warsaw in the final week of September. With the military campaign virtually over, Polish resistance was confined to the Hel Peninsula, Warsaw, and Modlin. Kesselring&#x27;s air fleet was assigned to the north of the city. In the ensuing attacks, approximately 10 per cent of the city&#x27;s buildings were destroyed and 40 per cent damaged. The bombing killed between 20,000 and 25,000 civilians. Kesselring insisted that only military targets were attacked, but the lack of precision munitions made the bombing indiscriminate and militarily ineffective. For his part in the Polish campaign, Kesselring was personally awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross by Hitler.

===France and Low Countries===
Kesselring&#x27;s was not involved in the preparations for the campaigns in the west. Instead, it remained in the east on garrison duty, establishing new airbases and an air-raid precautions network in occupied Poland. However, after the Mechelen Incident, in which an aircraft made a forced landing in Belgium with copies of the German invasion plan, Göring relieved the commander of , Hellmuth Felmy, of his command and appointed Kesselring in his place on 15 January 1940. Arriving in the west, Kesselring found assigned to support Bock&#x27;s Army Group B.
Kesselring was more heavily committed in the Low Countries, with elements of his air command underpinning the attack on the Netherlands—Battle of the Netherlands—and Battle of Belgium. This included an airborne operation around Rotterdam and The Hague to seize airfields and bridges in the &quot;Fortress Holland&quot; area. The paratroopers were from Kurt Student&#x27;s airborne forces. Air and ground operations were to commence simultaneously, on Hitler&#x27;s orders. Bock showed little interest in the Hague operation and viewed the capture of the Dutch government as nothing more than a bonus. He preferred the seizure of the Moerdijk bridges to breach Fortress Holland. Kesselring promised his air fleet would prevent the French Army advancing from Antwerp and intervening.

The Battle of the Netherlands commenced on 10 May 1940. Kesselring&#x27;s air operation was successful against the small Belgian , which was rendered ineffective, and Royal Netherlands Air Force, though the Dutch harassed the until their surrender. The paratroopers, while initially successful, ran into fierce opposition in the Battle for The Hague, and the Battle of Rotterdam. The lost 54 per cent of the transport aircraft committed; 125 destroyed, 53 bogged down, and 47 severely damaged. Some 4,000 paratroops (1,200 prisoners) became casualties.

On 14 May 1940, responding to a call for assistance from Student and demands for the bombing of the city by Georg von Küchler, commanding the 18th Army, Kesselring ordered the bombing of Rotterdam city centre. Fires raged out of control, destroying much of the city. An estimated 800 civilians were killed and 78,000 made homeless.

Wartime Allied newspapers predicted that Kesselring &quot;will go down in history as the man who directed the bombing of the helpless Dutch city of Rotterdam, and slaughtered thousands of civilians.&quot; Under the Hague Convention of 1907, bombardment itself was not forbidden since Rotterdam was not an undefended city, but other aspects of the bombardment may have violated the laws of war. Historians are divided as to whether the bombing was an act of terror or served a tactical purpose.

After the surrender of the Netherlands on 14 May 1940, attempted to move forward to new airfields in Belgium while still providing support for the fast-moving ground troops. The Battle of France was going well, with Heinz Guderian forcing a crossing of the River Meuse at Sedan on 13 May 1940. To support the breakthrough, Wolfram von Richthofen&#x27;s [[8th Air Corps (Germany)| was transferred to . By 24 May, the Allied forces had been cut in two, and the German Army was only from [[Dunkirk]], the last port on the [[English Channel]] available to the cut-off Allied forces. However, that day Rundstedt ordered a halt.
Göring promised the encircled enemy could be destroyed by aerial bombardment. Kesselring and Richthofen protested. They argued their commands had suffered heavy losses in two weeks of incessant fighting and the fighter and dive-bombers would be forced to operate at their maximum range. Neither man was confident of gaining air superiority. The protests were disregarded. It left the burden of preventing the Allied [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation of Dunkirk]] to Kesselring&#x27;s air fleet. Hampered by poor flying weather and staunch opposition from the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), the German operation failed.

Kesselring and his air commanders turned their attention to the final phase of the battle for France; [[Case Red]]. On 3 June, in a prelude to Red, the conducted [[Operation Paula]], a strategic air offensive against factories and airfields in and around Paris. Though German losses were minimal, the results were disappointing. The high command () (OKL) wrongly perceived the operation a success. The campaign proceeded rapidly; the gained air superiority and held it. Kesselring&#x27;s air fleet spent June attempting to prevent a [[Operation Aerial|second evacuation]]. Kesselring&#x27;s bombers ranged further afield and contributed to &#x27;s (Flying Division 9) minelaying operations in the English Channel and [[Bay of Biscay]]—one of his bomber wings attacked shipping an hour after [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|the armistice]] came into effect.

For his role in the campaign in the west, Kesselring was promoted to ([[field marshal]]) during the [[1940 Field Marshal Ceremony]].

===Battle of Britain===
Following the campaign in France, Kesselring&#x27;s was committed to the [[Battle of Britain]]. &#x27;s headquarters was located in [[Brussels]]. Kesselring&#x27;s air fleet was numerically the strongest in the in mid–1940. He controlled formations in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France north of the [[Seine]]. Kesselring was initially responsible for the bombing of southeastern England and the London area, but as the battle progressed, command responsibility shifted, with Hugo Sperrle&#x27;s assuming responsibility for the night-time &quot;blitz&quot; attacks while conducted the main daylight operations.

Kesselring was sceptical about attacking Britain. He advocated capturing [[Gibraltar]] ([[Operation Felix]]), encouraging the British Government to negotiate, and then turning against London if necessary. Sperrle favoured attacking ports and shipping. Göring overruled them because he was sure the [[RAF Fighter Command]] was weak and could be defeated quickly. The air fleet commanders did not collaborate with each other to devise an air superiority plan, much less conduct inter-service conferences with the army and navy to develop a joint strategy. Kesselring, in particular, did not understand how the RAF fighter defences worked, and even after the war held the naïve assumption Fighter Command could simply have been destroyed in [[dogfight]]s.

The first phase of the battle—the (Channel Battles) was marginally successful. [[Adlertag|Operation Eagle]] and the [[The Hardest Day|18 August]] battles failed to break British air defences. The German attacks on RAF airfields reached a peak in the first week of September 1940. On the third day, Göring met with Sperrle and Kesselring. Göring was convinced Fighter Command was exhausted and favoured attacking London to draw out the last of the British fighter reserves. Kesselring enthusiastically agreed; Sperrle did not. Kesselring urged Göring to carry out an all-out attack, based on the unproven assertion that Fighter Command had been virtually destroyed. Sperrle dismissed Kesselring&#x27;s optimism and put British strength at the more accurate figure of 1,000 fighters. Nevertheless, Kesselring&#x27;s perception prevailed. The disagreement between the two air fleet commanders was not uncommon, and although they rarely quarrelled, their commands were separate and they did not coordinate their efforts. Instead, they fought separate campaigns.

The focus of air operations changed to destroying the docks and factories in the centre of London. The change in strategy has been described as militarily controversial. The decision certainly relieved the pressure on Fighter Command, but wartime records and post-war analysis have shown that Fighter Command was not on the verge of collapse as assumed by German intelligence.

On 7 September Kesselring&#x27;s air fleet was still the largest in the . At his command were 1,311 aircraft from an operational German total of 1,895. Eight days later his air fleet alone carried out a daylight air attack on London which is considered the climax of the battle. In staging a two-pronged, predictable set-piece attack, he played into Fighter Command&#x27;s hands. As one analyst wrote, Kesselring was &quot;back where he started&quot; before the battle. The consequences for airmen were severe on [[Battle of Britain Day|15 September 1940]]. German aviators met a prepared enemy and lost 5.5 per cent of the committed force. In the afternoon loss rates of German bomber crews reached 18 per cent of the force sent out. German crew losses were seven times that of the British. Furthermore, Fighter Command did not commit its reserve during the main attacks as the German command predicted.

 continued [[The Blitz]] on British cities until May 1941. The zone of operations extended on a line from [[Selsey Bill]], to [[Oxford]], [[Birmingham]]–[[Manchester]] and [[Carlisle]]. Everything west of that line was Sperrle&#x27;s responsibility. On 20 October, the OKL ordered Sperrle to take on most of the burden of night operations. Kesselring was instructed to concentrate on ports in [[Eastern England]] and carry out at least 50 airstrikes in London per night. The air fleet deployed single-engine aircraft, including dive-bombers, nicknamed &quot;&quot; (light Kesselrings) in hit-and-run raids. These tactics became a feature of the later phases of the Blitz.

The air fleet played a large role in the [[Birmingham Blitz|Birmingham]] and [[Coventry Blitz]], with support from , which provided 304 of the 448 bombers in the attack. Surviving German records suggest that the aim of the Coventry raid was to disrupt production and reconstruction critical to the automotive industry, but also to [[Dehousing|dehouse]] workers. In the area of operations of were two other armament hubs—both the [[Hull Blitz|port of Hull]] and industrial city of [[Sheffield Blitz|Sheffield were heavily bombed]] by units under the air fleet&#x27;s command. Many of the fleet&#x27;s units were involved in the attack known as the [[Second Great Fire of London]], on 29/30 December 1940.

===Invasion of the Soviet Union===
Although earmarked for operations against the Soviet Union, remained in the west until May 1941. The maintenance of pressure on British cities was a deception measure to mask the eastward deployment of the Luftwaffe. German airfield construction had also fallen behind schedule and they could not host combat units until May, although they were ready for the commencement of [[Operation Barbarossa]] on 22 June 1941. Kesselring arranged with Göring for to be allocated additional transport to allow it to keep up with fast-moving armoured columns. The failure of German [[military logistics|logistics]] left only 15 per cent of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s 100,000 vehicles operational by the end of 1941.

 operated in support of [[Army Group Centre]], commanded by Bock, continuing the close working relationship between the two. Kesselring&#x27;s mission was to gain air superiority, and if possible [[air supremacy]], as soon as possible while still supporting ground operations. For this, he had a fleet of 1,223 aircraft, which made up half of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s commitment. Kesselring later remarked he &quot;instructed my air force and flak generals to consider the wishes of the Army as my orders.&quot;

The German attack caught large numbers of [[Soviet Air Force]] aircraft on the ground. Faulty tactics—sending unescorted bombers against the Germans at regular intervals in tactically unsound formations—accounted for many more. Kesselring reported that in the first week of operations had accounted for 2,500 Soviet aircraft in the air and on the ground. Even Göring found these figures hard to believe and ordered them to be checked. As the ground troops advanced, the figures could be directly confirmed and were found to be too low. Kesselring wrote that within days, he was able to fly over the front in his [[Focke-Wulf Fw 189]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]] to observe the terrain and advance.

With air supremacy attained, concentrated on ground operations, particularly guarding the flanks of the armoured spearheads, without which the rapid advance was not possible. When enemy [[counterattack]]s threatened, Kesselring threw the full weight of his force against them. Now that the Army was convinced of the value of air support, units were all too inclined to call for it. Kesselring now had to convince the Army that air support should be concentrated at critical points. He strove to improve army–air cooperation with new tactics and the appointment of [[Martin Fiebig]] as a special close air support commander.

By 26 July, Kesselring had reported the destruction of 165 tanks, 2,136 vehicles and 194 artillery pieces. His fleet also claimed 915 aircraft destroyed (823 on the ground) and 60 locomotives in 1,574 [[sortie]]s. Kesselring&#x27;s air fleet provided support in the battle of [[battle of Białystok–Minsk|Białystok–Minsk]] and [[Battle of Smolensk (1941)|Smolensk]]. [[Bombing of Minsk in World War II|Minsk was devastated]] by German air raids. A sudden transfer of his air power north to , bad weather, and the resurgence of the Red Air Force in his sector, led to the defeat [[Yelnya Offensive|at Yelna]] in September. The cost of the successful encirclement battles was severe. In a thirteen-day period during the battle for Smolensk, from 6–19 July, Kesselring&#x27;s air fleet lost 447 aircraft.

In late 1941, supported the final German offensive against Moscow, [[Battle of Moscow|Operation Typhoon]]. Raids on Moscow proved hazardous. Kesselring rated the opposition from both fighters and [[anti-aircraft]] guns. Kesselring began bombing raids on the capital on 21 July with four bomber wings numbering 195 aircraft—the largest during the period. Strategic bombing operations were intensive in October 1941, but diverted from the army support sphere, and dissipated the air effort. Militarily they had no effect and were considered prestige operations. Kesselring was uncharacteristically pessimistic about the results of the raids.

In the initial stages, Kesselring&#x27;s air fleet carried out effective support operations. On 3 October, it claimed 679 vehicles were destroyed in 984 sorties, and 450 vehicles and 22 tanks the following day. The bad weather that hampered ground operations in Operation Typhoon from October on impeded air operations even more, but continued to fly critical reconnaissance, interdiction, close-air support and aerial resupply missions. The intensity of attacks was evident in the number of combat operations flown: 690 on 7 October, and 537 on 10 October, and approximately 900 on 12 and 13 October. The 10 October missions resulted in claims of 450 vehicles and 150 artillery pieces destroyed. Over-confidence in victory caused the withdrawal of Kesselring&#x27;s air fleet to the Mediterranean. The air corps belonging to were sent to Germany or other sectors.

Between 22 June and 5 December 1941, the Luftwaffe lost 2,093 aircraft. Soviet sources give Red Air Force total aircraft losses as 21,200, of which at least 10,000 were destroyed in air combat. Despite the impressive statistics, on 5 December, the Red Army began a large-scale counter-offensive which ended the threat to Moscow and Barbarossa. The decision to remove Kesselring&#x27;s air fleet in November irretrievably weakened German air power in the Soviet Union. The air supremacy Germany enjoyed in June and July 1941 dissipated due to the strain of maintaining a presence along a front. Increased commitments in other theatres prevented the Luftwaffe from fielding adequate reserves to sustain prolonged periods of close air support along the Eastern Front. The Red Air Force remained a viable threat which only heightened as the war continued.

===Mediterranean and North Africa===

In November 1941, Kesselring was appointed [[Commander-in-Chief]] South and was transferred to Italy along with his staff, which for the time being also functioned as his Commander-in-Chief South staff. Only in January 1943 did he form his headquarters into a true [[Theater (warfare)|theatre]] staff and create a separate staff to control . As a theatre commander, he was answerable directly to the (OKW) and commanded ground, naval and air forces, but this was of little importance at first as most German units in the theatre were under Italian operational control.

In 1941 it was clear whoever controlled [[Malta]] held an advantage. The island sat in the middle of the Mediterranean in the path of maritime trading routes—and Maltese–based British forces had taken a heavy toll of Axis shipping. Malta provided a base from which British aircraft and submarines could interdict Axis convoys headed for North Africa. Without the vital supplies they carried, particularly fuel, the Axis forces in North Africa could not conduct operations. In October 1941, 63 per cent of Axis supply ships had been sunk, and in November it was 77 per cent. Periodically, Kesselring established local air superiority and [[Siege of Malta (1940)|neutralised Malta]]. Kesselring ordered attacks on the island&#x27;s airfields, ports and infrastructure, along with [[Malta Convoys]], which provided food and war materials to the island.

Kesselring&#x27;s made an immediate impact. The offensive formally opened on 20 March 1942. One-third of the bombing effort was directed against airfields. Conflicting Axis priorities, insufficient forces, and concentration of force, coupled with British determination to reinforce and supply Malta, defeated Kesselring. After May 1942 the British air defences were not seriously threatened, and by August, the air battle over the island had subsided. Kesselring&#x27;s air fleet flew 11,000 sorties against the island from early April to 10 May, placing the garrison and population in dire straits. Approximately 30,000 buildings were destroyed or damaged and 1,300 civilians were killed. The Allied losses in airmen, fighter aircraft, warships and transport ships were high. The effectiveness of the attacks brought the population to the brink of starvation. Axis shipping losses fell to 20–30 per cent.

Through suppressing Maltese–based forces, Kesselring managed to deliver an increased flow of supplies to [[Erwin Rommel]]&#x27;s [[Afrika Korps]] in Libya. The Axis lost only three per cent of their seaborne supplies and the central Mediterranean was closed, once again, to Allied shipping. With his forces thus strengthened, Rommel prepared an attack on the British positions around [[Gazala]], while Kesselring planned [[Operation Herkules]], an airborne and seaborne attack on Malta with the Italian [[185th Infantry Division &quot;Folgore&quot;]] and the German [[Ramcke Parachute Brigade]]. Kesselring hoped to thereby secure the Axis [[line of communication]] with North Africa.

For the [[Battle of Gazala]], Rommel divided his command in two, taking personal command of the mobile units of the Afrika Korps and [[Italian XX Motorised Corps]], which he led around the southern flank of [[Lieutenant General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Neil Ritchie]]&#x27;s [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]. Rommel left the infantry of the Italian [[X Army Corps (Italy)|X]] and [[XXI Army Corps (Italy)|XXI Corps]] under [[Ludwig Crüwell]] to hold the rest of the Eighth Army in place. This command arrangement went awry on 29 May 1942 when Crüwell was shot down and he was taken prisoner. Lacking an available commander of sufficient seniority, Kesselring assumed personal command of , placing himself under Rommel&#x27;s command even though he was the senior officer. It was the first time Kesselring had held a senior ground command, albeit a temporary one. He was able to relieve Rommel&#x27;s logistical problems by pushing a supply convoy through the British minefields.

Kesselring was critical of Rommel&#x27;s performance in the [[Battle of Bir Hakeim]], a vital position held by the [[1st Free French Division|1st Free French Brigade]] that formed the southern pivot of the British Gazala Line. Rommel called for, and Kesselring provided, air support, but the infantry assaults failed to capture the position. Kesselring attributed this to faulty coordination between the ground and air attacks. The Luftwaffe lost 14 aircraft on 3 and 4 June, and Kesselring was concerned that the Army planned to have the Luftwaffe starve the position out. After a ground assault led by Rommel in person, and air strikes by 124 Stukas and 76 [[Junkers Ju 88]]s escorted by 170 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109s]], Bir Hakeim was evacuated by the Free French on 10 June. For Rommel&#x27;s [[Axis capture of Tobruk|capture of Tobruk]] on 21 June, Kesselring brought in additional aircraft from Greece and Crete. In June over 260 German aircraft were in North Africa, and 7,035 sorties were flown. Over 33,000 prisoners were taken when Tobruk fell. For his part in the campaign, Kesselring was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords, but he lost his one-rank advantage over his subordinates; Rommel was promoted to on 22 June, and [[Ugo Cavallero]] became a [[Marshal of Italy]] on 1 July, followed by [[Ettore Bastico]] on 12 August.

In the wake of the victory at Tobruk, Rommel persuaded Hitler to authorise an attack on Egypt instead of Malta, over Italian and Kesselring&#x27;s objections. Cavallero&#x27;s diary and [[Friedrich von Mellenthin]]&#x27;s account in &quot;Panzer Battles&quot; support this version of events, but on 24 June 1942 Bastico and Kesselring approved Rommel&#x27;s request to pursue the British Eighth Army into Egypt. The Malta operation never had the wholehearted support of OKW, and historians remain doubtful that it would have been successful. The parachute troops assembled for Operation Herkules were sent to Rommel. The failure to eliminate Malta was a crucial blow to Axis ambitions in North Africa. Kesselring claimed he had recognised and pressed for the elimination of Malta by invasion, and blamed Rommel, the OKW and the Italians for the failure to act.

Things went well at first, with Rommel winning the [[First Battle of El Alamein#Battle of Mersa Matruh|Battle of Mersa Matruh]]. But as Kesselring and Italian commanders argued, the logistical difficulties mounted and the result was the disastrous fighting of the [[First Battle of El Alamein]] and [[Battle of Alam el Halfa]]. When Rommel arrived at Alamein he had only 6,500 men and 85 tanks–only 1,500 of the infantry and 55 of the tanks were German.

Kesselring supported Rommel&#x27;s decision to withdraw. He considered Rommel to be a great general leading fast-moving troops at the corps level of command, but felt that he was too moody and changeable for higher command. For Kesselring, Rommel&#x27;s nervous breakdown and hospitalisation for depression at the end of the North African campaign only confirmed this.

Kesselring was briefly considered as a possible successor to [[Wilhelm Keitel]] as Chief of Staff of the OKW in September 1942, with [[Friedrich Paulus]] replacing [[Alfred Jodl]] as Chief of the Operations Staff at OKW. That Kesselring was considered for this appointment demonstrated the high regard in which Kesselring was held by Hitler. Nevertheless, Hitler decided that neither Kesselring nor Paulus could be spared from their current posts. In October 1942, Kesselring was given direct command of all German armed forces in the theatre except Rommel&#x27;s [[Panzer Army Africa|German-Italian Panzer Army]] in North Africa, including [[Enno von Rintelen]], the German liaison officer at the Italian . Kesselring&#x27;s command also included the troops in Greece and the Balkans until the end of the year, when Hitler created another army group headquarters under [[Wilhelm List]], naming him Wehrmacht Commander-in-Chief South East.

===Tunisia===
[[Operation Torch]], the Allied invasion of French North Africa, precipitated a crisis in Kesselring&#x27;s command. He ordered [[Walther Nehring]], the former commander of the Afrika Korps who was returning to action after recovering from wounds received at the Battle of Alam el Halfa, to proceed to Tunisia to take command of a new corps ([[LXXXX Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|LXXXX Corps]]). Kesselring ordered Nehring to establish a bridgehead in Tunisia and then to press west as far as possible so as to gain freedom to manoeuvre. By December, the Allied commander, [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], was forced to concede that Kesselring had won the race; the final phase of Torch had failed and the Axis could only be ejected from Tunisia after a prolonged struggle.

With the initiative back with the Germans and Italians, Kesselring hoped to launch an offensive that would drive the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] out of North Africa. At the [[Battle of the Kasserine Pass]] his forces gave the Allies a beating, but in the end, strong Allied resistance and a string of Axis errors stopped the advance. Kesselring now concentrated on shoring up his forces by moving the required tonnages of supplies from Italy but his efforts were frustrated by Allied aircraft and submarines. An [[Operation Vulcan|Allied offensive in April]] finally broke through, leading to a collapse of the Axis position in Tunisia. Some 275,000 German and Italian troops were taken prisoner. In return, Kesselring had, however, held up the Allies in Tunisia for six months. The delay ended any prospect of an Allied invasion of Northern France in 1943, although it was not the only reason for its postponement to the middle of 1944.

The question of [[History of the Jews in Tunisia|Tunisian Jews]] and their treatment by German forces has also been raised. According to one source, German forces exploited Tunisian Jews for [[slave labour]], though no evidence has surfaced to suggest they were murdered in Africa.

By this time, Kesselring was derisively nicknamed &quot;Smiling Albert&quot; by the Allies, but was known as &quot;Uncle Albert&quot; by his troops. He was one of the most popular generals of World War II with the German . His popularity was enhanced by frequent, often unannounced, visits to the front line. [[Hans von Luck]] wrote that Kesselring was respected because he was the only senior commander to visit the front in North Africa.

===Italian campaign===

====Sicily====

Kesselring expected that the Allies would next invade Sicily, as a landing could be made there under fighter cover from Tunisia and Malta. He reinforced the six coastal and four mobile Italian divisions there with two mobile German divisions, the [[33rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzergrenadier Division]] and the [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann Göring|Hermann Göring Panzer Division]], both rebuilt after being destroyed in Tunisia. In his memoirs, Kesselring wrote that he was well aware that while this force was large enough to stop the Allies from simply marching in, it could not withstand a large-scale invasion. He therefore pinned his hopes on an immediate counterattack, which he ordered [[Paul Conrath]] of the Hermann Göring Panzer Division to carry out the moment the objective of the Allied invasion fleet was known, with or without orders from the island commander, [[Alfredo Guzzoni]].

The [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] on 10 July 1943 was stubbornly opposed. Kesselring hoped that the Allied invasion fleet would provide good targets for [[U-boat]]s, but they met with few successes. Pressure from the Allied air forces forced , commanded since June by Richthofen, to withdraw most of its aircraft to the mainland. Unaware that Guzzoni had already ordered a major counterattack on 11 July, Kesselring bypassed the chain of command to order the Hermann Göring Panzer Division to attack that day in the hope that a vigorous attack could succeed before the Americans could bring the bulk of their artillery and armoured support ashore. Although his troops gave the Americans &quot;quite a battering&quot;, they failed to capture the Allied position.

According to Kesselring, he flew to Sicily himself on 12 July to survey the situation and decided that no more than a delaying action was possible and that the island would eventually have to be abandoned. Nonetheless, he intended to fight on, and he reinforced Sicily with the [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|1st Parachute Division]] and the [[29th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|29th Panzergrenadier Division]]. Kesselring returned to Sicily on 16 July to confer with Guzzoni and the senior German commander, [[Hans-Valentin Hube]]. Kesselring and Guzzoni still did not believe all was lost, and agreed not to evacuate Sicily, despite the danger of it being cut off by another Allied amphibious operation. Unable to provide much more in the way of air support, Kesselring gave Hube command of the heavy [[flak]] units on the island, although this was contrary to Luftwaffe doctrine. [[Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin]] later wrote that he thought that Kesselring was pursuing an &quot;eye-catching defensive success&quot; after the disaster in Tunisia.

Kesselring managed to delay the Allies in Sicily for another month; the Allied conquest of Sicily was not complete until 17 August. His evacuation of Sicily, which began a week earlier on 10 August, was perhaps the most brilliant action of the campaign. In spite of the Allies&#x27; superiority on land, at sea, and in the air, Kesselring was able to evacuate not only 40,000 men, but also 9,605 vehicles, 94 guns, 47 tanks, 1,100 tons of ammunition, 970 tons of fuel, and 15,000 tons of stores. He was able to achieve near-perfect coordination among the three services under his command while his opponent, Eisenhower, could not.

====Allied invasion of Italy====
With the fall of Sicily, OKW feared that Italy would withdraw from the war, but Kesselring remained confident that the Italians would continue to fight. OKW regarded Kesselring and Rintelen as too pro-Italian and began to bypass them, sending Rommel to northern Italy, and Student to Rome, where his [[I Parachute Corps (Germany)|I Parachute Corps]] was under OKW orders to occupy the capital in case of Italian defection. [[Benito Mussolini]] was [[25 Luglio|removed from power]] on 25 July 1943, and Rommel and OKW began to plan for the occupation of Italy and the disarmament of the Italian Army. Kesselring was not informed of these plans for the time being. Kesselring claimed in his memoirs that Hitler&#x27;s assessment was that &quot;Kesselring is too honest for those born traitors down there&quot;.

On the advice of Rommel and Jodl, Hitler decided that the [[Italian Peninsula]] could not be held without the assistance of the Italian Army. The plan was not to give up the whole of Italy and retreat to the Alps, but to hold the [[Po Valley]]. Kesselring was ordered to withdraw from southern Italy and consolidate his forces with Rommel&#x27;s Army Group B in Northern Italy, where Rommel would assume overall command. Kesselring was slated to be posted to Norway.
For his part, Kesselring was convinced that all was well, that the Italians would continue to fight, and that there was no threat to his troops or his communications. He was appalled at the prospect of abandoning Italy, which he felt was completely unnecessary, as he was certain that Italy south of the northern [[Apennine Mountains]] could be held for six to nine months. This assessment was based on his belief that the Allies would not conduct operations outside the range of their air cover, which could only reach as far as [[Salerno]]. Kesselring submitted his resignation on 14 August 1943, but [[Karl Wolff]], the [[SS and police leader|Supreme SS and Police Leader]] in Italy, intervened on Kesselring&#x27;s behalf with Hitler. Wolff painted Rommel as &quot;politically unreliable&quot;, and argued that Kesselring&#x27;s presence in southern Italy was vital to prevent an early Italian defection. On Wolff&#x27;s advice, Hitler refused to accept Kesselring&#x27;s resignation.

[[Armistice of Cassibile|Italy withdrew from the war on 8 September]], and the Germans executed [[Operation Achse]], in which they disarmed Italian units. How Operation Achse played out depended on the location and the ratio of German to Italian forces, and the attitude of Italian division commanders. Kesselring immediately moved to secure Rome. He ordered the [[3rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|3rd Panzergrenadier Division]] and [[2nd Parachute Division (Germany)|2nd Parachute Division]] to close on the city, while a detachment made an unsuccessful attempt to seize the Italian Army staff at [[Monterotondo]] in a &quot;[[coup de main]]&quot; operation. Kesselring&#x27;s two divisions were faced by five Italian divisions, including the [[132nd Armoured Division Ariete|Ariete]] and [[131st Armoured Division Centauro|Centauro]] armoured divisions, but using bluff, negotiation, appeals to brothers in arms from the fighting in North Africa, and occasionally brute force, he managed to overcome the opposition, disperse the Italian forces and secure the city in two days.

Mussolini was rescued by the Germans in [[Unternehmen Eiche]], a raid planned by Student and carried out by [[Otto Skorzeny]] on 12 September, the details of which were deliberately, though unsuccessfully, kept from Kesselring, according to his memoirs. Rommel deported Italian soldiers, except for those willing to serve in German units, to Germany for forced labour, whereas Italian units in Kesselring&#x27;s area were initially disbanded and their men permitted to go home. A massacre outside his command would nonetheless have consequences for Kesselring. Foreign ministers from the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union were meeting in Moscow when they received the news that 100 Italian officers had been killed in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Kos (1943)|Battle of Kos]]. Appalled, they then issued the [[Moscow Declaration]] on 31 October 1943, which laid out the criteria for the punishment of crimes committed by Germany and its allies.

Italy now effectively became an occupied country, as the Germans poured in troops, although neither side accorded it that status. The Allies accorded Italy the status of &quot;co-belligerent&quot; rather than that of an ally, which meant that Italians could still be tried for war crimes. According to his memoirs, Kesselring blamed the Allies for the tragedy that unfolded in Italy. He felt that Hitler would have been willing to allow Italy to withdraw from the war had the Allies agreed to respect its neutrality and not use it as a base for operations against Germany.

====Salerno====

Kesselring claimed in his memoirs that his command was already &quot;written off&quot;, but he intended to fight. Eisenhower had excellent intelligence through [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]], the decryption of German [[Enigma machine]] signals and Japanese [[Type B Cipher Machine|Purple]] diplomatic messages, and from the Italians themselves, and was aware of the German plans to withdraw from southern Italy. He therefore adopted a risky strategy of making a series of landings in Italy rather than concentrating his forces. Kesselring inadvertently misled him better than the best deception plan could have.

At the [[Operation Avalanche|Battle of Salerno]] in September 1943, Kesselring launched a full-scale counterattack against the [[United States Army North|US Fifth Army]] landings there with [[Heinrich von Vietinghoff]]&#x27;s [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|Tenth Army]]. The counterattack inflicted heavy casualties on the Allies, forced them back in several areas, and, for a time, made Allied commanders contemplate evacuation. The short distance from German airfields allowed to put 120 aircraft over the Salerno area on 11 September 1943. The German offensive ultimately failed to throw the Allies back into the sea because of the intervention of Allied [[naval gunfire]] which decimated the advancing German units, stubborn Allied resistance and the advance of the British Eighth Army. On 17 September 1943, Kesselring gave Vietinghoff permission to break off the attack and withdraw.

Kesselring had been defeated but gained precious time. Already, in defiance of his orders, he was preparing a series of successive fallback positions on the [[Volturno Line]], the [[Barbara Line]] and the [[Bernhardt Line]]. The port of Naples was therefore denied to the Allies until October. The Apennine Mountains run along the centre of the Italian Peninsula, and therefore the rivers and gorges radiate down to the sea on both coasts. The mountains gave the Germans good [[artillery observer|observation]], and allowed them to conduct a classic [[reverse slope defence]], with the forward slopes thinly manned, but covered by machine guns with interlocking fields of fire, minefields, and in some cases deliberately flooded valleys. Allied artillery was reduced in effectiveness due to the poor observation of well-concealed German positions, and the need to fire at high angles to clear the mountain tops. The onset of wet autumn weather and inadequate road network also favoured the defence. Low cloud cover hampered observation from the air, and muddy roads slowed the delivery of ammunition and supplies to forward areas.

Only in November 1943, after a month of hard fighting, did the Allies reach Kesselring&#x27;s main position, the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]]. This was the narrowest part of the peninsula. Kesselring estimated that it could be held with just eleven divisions, with a couple of mobile divisions in reserve to guard against an Allied amphibious landing, whereas the position in the Northern Apennines would require up to twenty divisions. Kesselring accepted the risk of being outflanked by an amphibious landing, which he believed would be Eisenhower&#x27;s best move. He was not aware that the necessary amphibious lift had been sent to the Indian Ocean for Operation Buccaneer, a landing in southern Burma, which was eventually cancelled. According to his memoirs, Kesselring felt that even more could have been accomplished if he had been given access to the troops held &quot;uselessly&quot; under Rommel&#x27;s command.
In November 1943, Kesselring met with Hitler. Kesselring gave an optimistic assessment of the situation in Italy and gave reassurances that he could hold the Allies south of Rome on the Gustav Line. Kesselring further promised that he could prevent the Allies from reaching the Northern Apennines for at least six months. As a result, on 6 November 1943, Hitler ordered Rommel and his Army Group B headquarters to move to France to take charge of the [[Atlantic Wall]] and prepare for the Allied attack that was expected there in the spring of 1944. On 21 November 1943, Kesselring resumed command of all German forces in Italy, combining Commander-in-Chief South, a joint command, with that of [[Army Group C]], a ground command. &quot;I had always blamed Kesselring&quot;, Hitler told a conference in August 1944, &quot;for looking at things too optimistically ... events have proved Rommel wrong, and I have been justified in my decision to leave Field Marshal Kesselring there, whom I have seen as an incredible political idealist, but also as a military optimist, and it is my opinion that military leadership without optimism is not possible.&quot;

The Luftwaffe scored a notable success on the night of 2 December 1943 when 105 Junkers Ju 88s [[Air Raid on Bari|struck the port of Bari]]. Skilfully using [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]] to confuse the Allied [[radar]] operators, they found the port packed with brightly lit Allied shipping. The result was the most destructive air raid on Allied shipping since the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941. Hits were scored on two ammunition ships and a tanker. Burning oil and exploding ammunition spread over the harbour. Some 16 ships were sunk and eight damaged, and the port was put out of action for three weeks. Moreover, one of the ships sunk, , had been carrying [[mustard gas]], which enveloped the port in a cloud of poisonous vapours.

====Cassino and Anzio====

The first Allied attempt to break through the Gustav Line in the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] in January 1944 met with early success, with the [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|British X Corps]] breaking through the line held by the [[94th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|94th Infantry Division]] and imperilling the entire Tenth Army. Kesselring rushed his reserves, the 29th and [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Panzergrenadier Divisions]], to the Cassino front. They were able to stabilise the German position there but left Rome poorly guarded.

Kesselring wrote in his memoirs that he felt that he had been out-generalled when the Allies [[Battle of Anzio|landed at Anzio]]. A few days before, he had told Jodl that he did not consider a mid-winter Allied amphibious operation likely. [[Admiral (Germany)|Admiral]] [[Wilhelm Canaris]], the chief of the , the German military intelligence service, advised that it was out of the question for four to six weeks. Although taken by surprise, Kesselring moved rapidly to regain control of the situation, summoning &quot;Generaloberst&quot; [[Eberhard von Mackensen]]&#x27;s [[14th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourteenth Army]] headquarters and the [[65th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|65th]] and 362nd Divisions from northern Italy, the 29th and 90th Panzergrenadier Divisions from the Cassino front, and the [[23rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|26th Panzer Division]] from Tenth Army. OKW contributed some troops from other theatres, and by February Kesselring was able to take the offensive at Anzio. His forces were unable to crush the Allied [[beachhead]], and in his memoirs, Kesselring blamed himself, OKW and Mackensen for avoidable errors.

Meanwhile, costly fighting at [[Monte Cassino]] in February 1944, brought the Allies close to a breakthrough into the [[Liri Valley]]. To hold the bastion of Monte Cassino, Kesselring brought in the 1st Parachute Division, an &quot;exceptionally well trained and conditioned&quot; formation, on 26 February. Despite heavy casualties and the expenditure of enormous quantities of ammunition, an Allied offensive in March 1944 failed to break the Gustav Line position.

One disadvantage of the geography of the Italian peninsula that otherwise favoured the defence was that it constricted the German line of communication. The Allies took advantage of this with [[Operation Strangle (World War II)|Operation Strangle]], an intensive air interdiction campaign. Through [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]] they knew precisely how much tonnage was needed to support the Tenth Army at Cassino and the Fourteenth Army at Anzio. Between 15 March and 10 May 1944, US [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Ira Eaker]]&#x27;s [[Mediterranean Allied Air Forces]] flew 21,688 interdiction sorties, during which it dropped of bombs. This left Army Group C critically short of fuel and ammunition.

On 11 May 1944 [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]], commanding the [[Allied Armies in Italy]], launched [[Operation Diadem]], which finally broke through the Gustav Line and forced the Tenth Army to withdraw. Due to fuel and transportation shortages, units had to be moved piecemeal. Kesselring appealed to the to move more supplies by sea and urged his corps and division commanders to conserve ammunition. In the process, a gap opened up between the Tenth and Fourteenth Armies, threatening both with encirclement. For this failure, Kesselring relieved Mackensen of his command, replacing him with [[Joachim Lemelsen]].

Fortunately for the Germans, [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Mark W. Clark]], commander of the U.S. Fifth Army, obsessed with the capture of Rome, failed to take advantage of the situation. Kesselring diverted troops to oppose Clark&#x27;s attack, and the result was three days of bloody and fruitless American assaults, while the gap between the Tenth and Fourteenth Armies was poorly defended. In the end, it was an advance in this sector that opened the gate to Rome, and the Tenth Army was able to link up with the Fourteenth Army, and conduct a fighting withdrawal to the next line of defence, the [[Trasimene Line]]. Whether Clark would have been able to trap Kesselring had he tried still remains an open question. [[Robert Citino]] noted that: &quot;Slithering out of a trap by the skin of their teeth was just another day at the office for German commanders by 1944. In Italy, facing two Allied armies coming on from opposite directions, the did it again, surviving yet another near-death experience and living to fight another day.&quot;

For his part in the campaign, Kesselring was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds by Hitler at the [[Wolfsschanze]] near [[Rastenburg]], [[East Prussia]] on 19 July 1944. The next day, Hitler was the target of the [[20 July plot]]. Informed of this event that evening by Göring, Kesselring, like many other senior commanders, sent a telegram to Hitler reaffirming his loyalty.

====Actions affecting population and cultural objects====
Kesselring, during the campaign, as far as he was able, attempted to avoid the destruction of many artistically important Italian cities, including Rome, Florence, [[Siena]] and [[Orvieto]]. In some cases, historic bridges—such as the [[Ponte Vecchio]]—were [[booby trap]]ped rather than blown up. However, other historic Florentine bridges were destroyed on his orders and, in addition to booby trapping the old bridge, he ordered the demolition of the ancient historical central borough at its two ends, in order to delay the Allied advance across the [[River Arno]].

Kesselring supported the Italian declaration of Rome as an [[open city]] on 14 August 1943, after Rome was bombed for the first time on 19 July with over 700 civilian deaths. The unilateral declaration was never accepted by the Allies as the city remained centres of government and industry, and while the Americans supported accepting the open city status of Rome, the British remained implacably opposed. The replacement of the American Eisenhower with the British General Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] as theatre commander loosened restrictions at that level. As a result, [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|Rome was bombed]] by the Allies many times.

For Kesselring, the open city status held many advantages, as it promised a means of quelling unrest in Rome and scored a propaganda triumph. Moreover, as Operation Strangle took its toll, trains ceased to move through Rome and German vehicle convoys routinely bypassed the city. Kesselring later wrote that when the fighting drew close to Rome in May 1944, there were considerable tactical advantages to be had from defending the [[Tiber]] bridges, but the German ambassador to the Vatican, [[Ernst von Weizsäcker]], urged Kesselring not to do so, and Kesselring withdrew from Rome without mounting a defence there, saving the city. After the Allies occupied Rome, the open city declaration was disregarded, and they made full use of Rome for military purposes.

Kesselring tried to preserve the monastery of Monte Cassino by avoiding its military occupation even though it offered superb observation over the battlefield. Ultimately this was unsuccessful, as the Allies believed the monastery would be used to direct the German artillery against their lines. On the morning of 15 February 1944, 142 [[B-17 Flying Fortress]], 47 [[B-25 Mitchell]] and 40 [[B-26 Marauder]] medium bombers deliberately dropped 1,150 tons of high explosives and incendiary bombs on the abbey, reducing the historic monastery to a smoking mass of rubble. Kesselring was aware that some artworks taken from Monte Cassino for safekeeping wound up in the possession of Hermann Göring. Kesselring had some German soldiers shot for looting. German authorities avoided giving the Italians control over artworks because they feared that &quot;entire collections would be sold to Switzerland&quot;. A 1945 Allied investigation reported that Italian cultural treasures had suffered relatively little war damage. Kesselring received regular updates on efforts to preserve cultural treasures and his personal interest in the matter contributed to the high proportion of art treasures that were saved.

====War crimes====
By 24 September 1943, [[Herbert Kappler]], the German police attaché who represented the (SD) in Rome, had learned that [[Heinrich Himmler]] wanted him to round up and deport the Jews of Rome. Kappler was concerned about a rise of anti-German sentiment among the Italian population. The German consul in Rome and then senior embassy diplomat, Eitel Friedrich Möllhausen, also learned of the order. According to writer [[Robert Katz]], who interviewed Möllhausen in 1968, Kappler suggested that they go to Kesselring to recommend that the Jews should be used for forced labour on fortifications in Rome (as he had done with those in Tunisia). If Kesselring would agree to that solution, Kappler would consider his orders to be countermanded. In his memoirs of 1948 Möllhausen recounts that he and Kappler met with Kesselring within an hour. Upon hearing how many men Kappler would need for the roundup, Kesselring declared that he could not spare a single man, and approved of the idea of using Jewish labour.

On 9 October Möllhausen was advised that the Roman Jews were to be deported and that he was not to interfere in any way. On 16 October [[Raid of the Ghetto of Rome|1,259 Jews were rounded up in Rome]], and 1,007 of them were sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. Upon arrival all but 196 were immediately gassed. Only 15 survived the war. Some 6,806 Jews were arrested and deported during the German occupation of Italy, of whom 5,969 died in [[Nazi concentration camps]]. Historian Andrew Sangster argues that while Kesselring never played an active role in [[The Holocaust]], he must have known of these crimes and his guilt lies &quot;in his unquestioning support of Hitler who had made the Holocaust a priority.&quot;
On 22–23 March 1944, a 15-man American [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) Operational Group landed in [[inflatable boat]]s from [[US Navy]] [[PT boats]] on the [[Liguria]]n coast as part of [[Operations Ginny I and II|Operation Ginny II]], a mission to blow up the entrances of two vital railway tunnels. Their boats were discovered and they were captured by a smaller group of Italian and German soldiers. On 26 March, they were executed under Hitler&#x27;s &quot;[[Commando Order]]&quot;, issued after German soldiers had been bound and shot by commandos during the [[Dieppe Raid]] and the [[Operation Basalt|Raid on Sark]]. Kesselring was in Liguria in 23 and 24 March, where he inspected the harbour defences.

In Rome on 23 March 1944, 33 policemen of the [[SS Police Regiment Bozen|Police Regiment Bozen]] from the German-speaking population of the Italian province of [[South Tyrol]] and three Italian civilians were killed by a bomb blast and the subsequent shooting. In response, Hitler approved the recommendation of Mackensen, who was responsible for the sector including Rome, that ten Italians should be shot for each policeman killed. The task fell to SS Herbert Kappler who, finding there were not enough condemned prisoners available, made up the numbers using Jewish prisoners and civilians taken from the streets. The result was the [[Ardeatine massacre]].

The fall of Rome on 4 June 1944 placed Kesselring in a dangerous situation as his forces attempted to withdraw from Rome to the formidable [[Gothic Line]] north of [[Florence]]. That the Germans were especially vulnerable to [[Italian partisans]] was not lost on Alexander, who appealed in a radio broadcast for Italians to kill Germans &quot;wherever you encounter them&quot;. Kesselring responded by authorising the &quot;massive employment of artillery, [[Granatwerfer 42|grenade]] and [[Minenwerfer|mortars]], [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], [[flamethrower]]s and other technical combat equipment&quot; against the partisans.

On 17 June, Kesselring issued a directive, &quot;New Measures for Combating Partisans&quot; (), in which he authorised measures of &quot;utmost severity&quot;, while extolling his troops to act irrespective of &quot;mistaken&quot; actions they may be responsible for. The order promised indemnity to soldiers who &quot;exceed our normal restraint in the choice of severity of the methods against the partisans&quot;. He also authorised construction of transit camps to hold suspected partisans and civilians. Three days later, Kesselring issued an order authorising reprisals against the civilian population and public executions of captured partisan leaders.
Subsequently, massacres were carried out by the Hermann Göring Panzer Division at [[Stia]] in April, [[Civitella in Val di Chiana]] in June and [[Bucine]] in July 1944, by the 26th Panzer Division at Padule di [[Fucecchio]] on 23 August 1944, and by the [[16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS]] at [[Sant&#x27;Anna di Stazzema massacre|Sant&#x27;Anna di Stazzema]] in August 1944 and [[Marzabotto massacre|Marzabotto]] in September and October 1944.

In August 1944 Kesselring was informed by [[Rudolf Rahn]], the German ambassador to the rump [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI), that Mussolini had filed protests about the killing of Italian citizens. In response, Kesselring rescinded his order and issued another edict to his troops on 21 August, acknowledging incidents that had &quot;damaged the German ″s reputation and discipline and which no longer have anything to do with reprisal operations&quot;, and launched investigations into specific cases that Mussolini cited. Between 21 July and 25 September 1944, 624 Germans were killed, 993 wounded and 872 missing in partisan operations, while some 9,520 partisans were killed. During the occupation of Italy, the Germans and their fascist allies are believed to have killed some 22,000 Italian civilians.

Throughout July and August 1944, Kesselring conducted a stubborn delaying action, gradually retreating to the Gothic Line. There, he was able to halt the Allied advance. Holding the Allies south of the Arno River for so long was another defensive success. Some partisan bands declared the area they occupied to be independent republics, including [[Domodossola]] in northern Italy on 26 September. Four days later Kesselring instructed Wolff to conduct an &quot;anti-partisan week&quot;. By the end of October, 1,539 partisans were dead, another 1,248 were captured, 1,973 suspects had been arrested, and 2,012 had been handed over to [[Organisation Todt]]. A further blow to the partisans came from Alexander. In a radio broadcast on 13 November, he conceded that the Germans would not be driven from their positions until spring, and asked the partisans to lay down their arms until then.

Casualties of the Gothic Line battles in September and October 1944 included Kesselring himself. On 23 October 1944, his car, travelling at night under blackout conditions, collided with a towed artillery piece coming out of a side road. Kesselring suffered serious head and facial injuries. He was taken to hospital in [[Ferrara]], and did not return to his command until January 1945.

===Central Europe===
As he later wrote, after he recovered from the car accident, Kesselring was summoned by Hitler to relieve Rundstedt as [[OB West|Commander-in-Chief West]] on 10 March 1945, following the disastrous loss of the intact [[Ludendorff Bridge]] over the [[Rhine]] during the [[Battle of Remagen]]. On arrival, he told his new staff, &quot;Well, gentlemen, I am the new V-3&quot;, referring to the [[Vergeltungswaffe]] (&quot;vengeance&quot; weapons). Given the desperate situation of the Western Front, this was another sign of Kesselring&#x27;s proverbial optimism. Kesselring still described Hitler&#x27;s analysis of the situation as &quot;lucid&quot;, according to which the Germans were about to inflict a historical defeat upon the Soviets, after which the victorious German armies would be brought west to crush the Allies and sweep them from the continent. Therefore, Kesselring was determined to hold in the west and await a victory in the east. Kesselring endorsed Hitler&#x27;s order that deserters should be hanged from the nearest tree. When a staff officer sought to make him aware of the hopelessness of the situation, Kesselring told him that he had driven through the entire army rear area and not seen a single hanged man.

The [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] at this time generally followed the Rhine with two important exceptions: the American bridgehead over the Rhine at [[Remagen]], and a large German [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] west of the Rhine, the [[Saarland|Saar]]–[[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] triangle. In his memoirs, Kesselring stated that he gave consideration to evacuating the triangle, but OKW ordered it held. When Kesselring paid his first visit to the German [[1st Army (Wehrmacht)|First]] and [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|Seventh]] Army headquarters there on 13 March 1945, the army group commander, [[Paul Hausser]], and the two army commanders all affirmed the defence of the triangle could only result in heavy losses or complete annihilation of their commands. [[Hans Felber]] of the Seventh Army considered the latter the most likely outcome. Nonetheless, Kesselring insisted that the positions had to be held.

The triangle was already under attack from two sides by Lieutenant General [[George Patton]]&#x27;s [[Third United States Army|US Third Army]] and Lieutenant General [[Alexander Patch]]&#x27;s [[Seventh United States Army|US Seventh Army]]. The German position soon crumbled and Kesselring later wrote that Hitler reluctantly sanctioned a withdrawal. The First and Seventh Armies suffered heavy losses: around 113,000 German casualties at the cost of 17,000 on the Allied side. Nonetheless, they had avoided encirclement and managed to conduct a skilful delaying action, evacuating the last troops to the east bank of the Rhine on 25 March 1945.

As Germany was cut in two, Kesselring&#x27;s command was enlarged to include Army Groups Centre, South and South-East on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], along with Army Group C in Italy, and his own [[Army Group G]] and [[Army Group Oberrhein (Germany)|Army Group Upper Rhine]]. On 30 April, Hitler committed suicide in Berlin. The next day, [[Karl Dönitz]] was designated [[President of Germany (1919–1945)|Reichspräsident]] and the [[Flensburg government]] was created. One of the new president&#x27;s first acts was the appointment of Kesselring as Commander-in-Chief Southern Germany, with plenipotentiary powers.

====Chaotic surrender====
Meanwhile, in Italy, Wolff and Vietinghoff, now commander of Army Group C, had almost concluded a preliminary surrender agreement with the OSS chief in Switzerland, [[Allen Dulles]]. Known as [[Operation Sunrise (World War II)|Operation Sunrise]], these secret negotiations had been in progress since early March 1945. Kesselring was aware of them, having previously consented to them, although he had not informed his own staff. According to his memoirs, Kesselring did later inform Hitler. At the last minute, Kesselring had a change of heart and decided not to accept the agreement, as he felt it might imperil Army Group G. On 30 April, he relieved both Vietinghoff and his chief of staff, [[Hans Röttiger]], putting them at the disposition of the OKW for a possible court martial. They were replaced by [[Friedrich Schulz]] and Friedrich Wenzel respectively.
The next morning, 1 May, Röttiger reacted by placing both Schulz and Wenzel under arrest, and summoning Lemelsen to take Schulz&#x27;s place. Lemelsen initially refused, as he was in possession of a written order from Kesselring which prohibited any talks with the enemy without his explicit authorisation. By this time, Vietinghoff and Wolff had concluded an armistice with Alexander, who was now a [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] and the Allied Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Theatre. The armistice became effective at 14:00 on 2 May. Lemelsen reached [[Bozen]], and Schulz and Wenzel regained control, this time agreeing with the officers pushing for a quick surrender. The German armies in Italy were now utterly defeated by the Allies, who were rapidly advancing from [[Garmisch]] toward [[Innsbruck]]. Kesselring remained opposed to the surrender but was finally won over by Wolff on the late morning of 2 May after a two-hour phone call to Kesselring at his headquarters in [[Pullach]].

North of the Alps, Army Group G followed suit on 6 May. According to his memoirs, Kesselring now decided to surrender his own headquarters. He ordered Hausser to supervise the SS troops to ensure that the surrender was carried out in accordance with his instructions. Kesselring then surrendered to an American major at [[Saalfelden]], near [[Salzburg]], in Austria on 9 May 1945. He was taken to see Major General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]], the commander of the [[101st Airborne Division (United States)|US 101st Airborne Division]], who treated him courteously, allowing him to keep his weapons and field marshal&#x27;s baton, and to visit the Eastern Front headquarters of Army Groups Centre and South at [[Zeltweg]] and [[Graz]] unescorted. Taylor arranged for Kesselring and his staff to move into a hotel at [[Berchtesgaden]]. Photographs of Taylor and Kesselring drinking tea together created a stir in the United States.

In his post-war memoirs, Kesselring said he envisaged making a start on the rehabilitation of Germany following the end of the war. Instead, he was arrested. On 15 May 1945, Kesselring was taken to [[Mondorf-les-Bains]] where his baton and decorations were taken from him and he was incarcerated. He was held in American POW camps before being transferred to British custody in 1946. He testified at the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg trial]] of Göring, but his offers to testify against Soviet, American and British commanders were declined.

==Post-war==
===Trial===

By the end of the war, for many Italians, the name of Kesselring, whose signature appeared on posters and printed orders announcing draconian measures adopted by the German occupation, had become synonymous with the oppression and terror that had characterised the German occupation. Kesselring&#x27;s name headed the list of German officers blamed for a long series of atrocities perpetrated by the German forces.

The Moscow Declaration of October 1943 promised that &quot;those German officers and men and members of the Nazi party who have been responsible for or have taken a consenting part in the above atrocities, massacres and executions will be sent back to the countries in which their abominable deeds were done in order that they may be judged and punished according to the laws of these liberated countries and of free governments which will be erected therein.&quot; However, the British, who were the driving force in moulding the war crimes trial policy that culminated in the Nuremberg trials, explicitly excluded high-ranking German officers in their custody.

The British held two major trials against the top German war criminals who had perpetrated crimes during the Italian campaign. For political reasons it was decided to hold the trials in Italy, but a request by Italy to allow an Italian judge to participate was denied on the grounds that Italy was not an Allied country. The trials were held under a royal warrant dated 18 June 1945, thus under British military law. This decision put the trials on a shaky legal basis, as foreign nationals were being tried for crimes against foreigners in a foreign country. The first trial, held in Rome, was of Mackensen and &quot;Generalleutnant &quot; [[Kurt Mälzer]], the military commandant of Rome, for their part in the Ardeatine massacre. Both were sentenced to death on 30 November 1946.

Kesselring&#x27;s own trial began in Venice on 17 February 1947. The British military court was presided over by [[Major General (United Kingdom)|Major General]] Sir [[Edmund Hakewill-Smith]], assisted by four lieutenant colonels. Colonel Richard C. Halse—who had already obtained the death penalty for Mackensen and Mälzer—was the prosecutor. Kesselring&#x27;s legal team was headed by [[Hans Laternser]], a skilful German lawyer who specialised in [[Anglo-Saxon law]], had represented several defendants at the Nuremberg trials, and later represented [[Erich von Manstein]]. Kesselring&#x27;s ability to pay his legal team was hampered because his assets had been frozen by the Allies, but his legal costs were eventually met by friends in South America and relatives in [[Franconia]].
Kesselring was arraigned on two charges: the shooting of 335 Italians in the Ardeatine massacre, and incitement to kill Italian civilians. He did not invoke the &quot;[[Nuremberg defence]]&quot; (although Laternser did in his closing arguments). Rather, Kesselring maintained that the order to kill ten Italian civilians for each German soldier killed by partisans was &quot;just and lawful&quot;. On 6 May 1947, the court found him guilty of both charges and sentenced him to death by firing squad, which was considered more honourable than hanging. Although the court accepted the legality of the taking of hostages, it left open the question of the legality of killing innocent persons in reprisals; the distinction between the two was later clarified in the [[High Command Trial]].

The planned major trial for the campaign of reprisals never took place, but a series of smaller trials were held instead in [[Padua]] between April and June 1947 for [[Willy Tensfeld]], Navy Waldemar Krumhaar, the 26th Panzer Division&#x27;s [[Eduard Crasemann]], and [[Max Simon]] of the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division . Tensfeld was acquitted; Crasemann was sentenced to 10 years; and Simon was sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted. Simon&#x27;s trial was the last held in Italy by the British. By 1949, British military tribunals had sentenced 230 Germans to death and another 447 to custodial sentences.

The only trial of German generals held by U.S. military tribunals in Italy was that of [[Anton Dostler]], the commander of the [[LXXV Army Corps (Germany)|LXXV Army Corps]], and Kurt Mälzer. Dostler stood trial in October 1945 for the execution of the 15 members of the US 2677th Special Reconnaissance Battalion during Operation Ginny. He was found guilty and shot on 1 December 1945. Mälzer stood trial in September 1946 for parading U.S. POWs through the streets of Rome in an abusive manner. Mälzer was found guilty and sentenced to 10 years in prison, although he was later transferred to British custody.

Several officers, all below the rank of general, including Kappler, were transferred to the Italian courts for trial. These applied very different legal standards from the British—ones which were often more favourable to the defendants. Although senior commanders repeatedly attempted to shift blame for atrocities onto the SS, the most senior SS commanders in Italy, Wolff and Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s personal representative in Italy, [[Eugen Dollmann]], escaped prosecution. In 1964, after Dulles had retired as head of the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]], Wolff was convicted of [[genocide]] by a German court. He was released in 1969.

===Commutation and release from prison===
The death verdict against Kesselring generated outrage in the United Kingdom, where Kesselring was viewed sympathetically by his former foes, including the former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], and Alexander, who sent a telegram to Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] in which he expressed his hope that Kesselring&#x27;s sentence would be commuted. &quot;As his old opponent on the battlefield&quot;, he stated, &quot;I have no complaints against him. Kesselring and his soldiers fought against us hard but clean.&quot; Alexander had expressed his admiration for Kesselring as a military commander as early as 1943. In his 1961 memoirs, Alexander paid tribute to Kesselring as a commander who &quot;showed great skill in extricating himself from the desperate situations into which his faulty intelligence had led him&quot;.

Alexander&#x27;s sentiments were echoed by Lieutenant General Sir [[Oliver Leese]], who had commanded the British Eighth Army in the Italian Campaign. In a May 1947 interview, Leese said he was &quot;very sad&quot; to hear of what he considered &quot;British victor&#x27;s justice&quot; being imposed on Kesselring, an &quot;extremely gallant soldier who had fought his battles fairly and squarely&quot;. Churchill remarked that &quot;Kesselring was a good general, with a competent staff&quot; in &quot;Triumph and Tragedy&quot;, the final volume of his &quot;[[History of the Second World War]]&quot;. [[William Sidney, 1st Viscount De L&#x27;Isle|Lord de L&#x27;Isle]], who had been awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for gallantry at Anzio, raised the issue in the [[House of Lords]].

The Italian government refused to carry out death sentences, as the death penalty had been abolished in Italy in 1944 and was regarded as a relic of Mussolini&#x27;s [[Fascism|Fascist]] regime. The Italian decision was very disappointing to the British government because the trials had partly been intended to meet the expectations of the Italian public. The War Office notified Lieutenant General [[John Harding, 1st Baron Harding of Petherton|Sir John Harding]], who had succeeded Alexander as commander of British forces in the Mediterranean in 1946, that there should be no more death sentences and those already imposed should be commuted. Accordingly, Harding commuted the death sentences imposed on Mackensen, Mälzer and Kesselring to life imprisonment on 4 July 1947. Mälzer died while still in prison in February 1952, while Mackensen, after having his sentence reduced to 21 years, was set free in October 1952.

In May 1947, Kesselring was moved from [[Mestre]] prison near Venice to [[Wolfsberg, Carinthia]]. While in Wolfsberg he was approached by a former SS major who had an escape plan prepared. According to Kesselring, he declined the offer on the grounds that it would be seen as a confession of guilt. Other senior Nazi figures did manage to escape from Wolfsberg to South America or Syria. In October 1947 he was transferred for the last time, to [[Werl Prison]], in [[Westphalia]].

Kesselring resumed his work on a history of the war that he was writing for the [[US Army Historical Division]]. This effort, working under the direction of [[Franz Halder]] in 1946, brought together a number of German generals for the purpose of producing historical studies of the war, including [[Gotthard Heinrici]], Heinz Guderian, [[Lothar Rendulic]], [[Hasso von Manteuffel]] and Küchler. Kesselring contributed studies of the war in Italy and North Africa and the problems faced by the German high command. Kesselring also worked secretly on his memoirs. The manuscript was smuggled out by Irmgard Horn-Kesselring, Rainer&#x27;s mother, who typed it at her home.

An influential group assembled in Britain to lobby for his release from prison. Headed by [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Lord Hankey]], the group included politicians Lord de L&#x27;Isle and [[Richard Stokes (politician)|Richard Stokes]], Alexander and [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] [[William Boyle, 12th Earl of Cork|The Earl of Cork and Orrery]], and military historians [[Basil Liddell Hart]] and [[J. F. C. Fuller]]. Upon regaining the prime ministership in 1951, Winston Churchill, who was closely associated with the group, gave priority to the quick release of the war criminals remaining in British custody.

Meanwhile, in Germany, the release of military prisoners had become a political issue. With the establishment of [[West Germany]] in 1949, and the advent of the [[Cold War]] between the former Allies and the Soviet Union, it became inevitable that the German armed forces would be revived in some form, and there were calls for amnesty for military prisoners as a condition for German military participation in the Western Alliance. A media campaign gradually gathered steam in Germany. published an interview with Liny Kesselring and ran a series about Kesselring and Manstein entitled &quot;Justice, Not Clemency&quot;. The pressure on the British government was increased in 1952 when the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|German Chancellor]] [[Konrad Adenauer]] made it clear that West German ratification of the [[European Defence Community]] Treaty was dependent on the release of German military figures.

In July 1952, Kesselring was diagnosed with a cancerous growth in his throat. During World War I, he had frequently smoked up to twenty cigars per day but had quit smoking in 1925. Although the British were suspicious of the diagnosis, they were concerned that he might die in prison as Mälzer did, which would be a public relations disaster. Kesselring was transferred to a hospital, under guard. In October 1952, he was released from his prison sentence on the grounds of ill health. His release unleashed a storm of protest in Italy.

===Later life===
In 1952, while still in the hospital, Kesselring accepted the honorary presidency of three veterans&#x27; organisations. The first was the , consisting of veterans. The , the veterans&#x27; association of the Afrika Korps, soon followed. More controversial was the presidency of the right-wing veterans&#x27; association, [[Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Der Stahlhelm]]. The leadership of this organisation tarnished his reputation. He attempted to reform the organisation, proposing that the new [[Flag of Germany|German flag]] be flown instead of the old [[Flag of the German Empire|Imperial Flag]]; that the old greeting ! be abolished; and that members of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] be allowed to join. The response from the organisation was unenthusiastic.

Kesselring&#x27;s release caused an outcry and indignation in the [[Italian Parliament]]. Kesselring reacted provocatively, asserting that he had saved the lives of millions of Italians by not following certain orders and that they ought to build him a monument. In response, on 4 December 1952, [[Piero Calamandrei]], an Italian jurist, soldier, university professor, and politician, who had been a leader of the [[Italian resistance movement]], penned an [[anti-fascist]] poem, (&quot;A Monument to Ignominy&quot;). In the poem, Calamandrei stated that if Kesselring returned he would indeed find a monument, but one stronger than stone, composed of Italian resistance fighters who &quot;willingly took up arms, to preserve dignity, not to promote hate, and who decided to fight back against the shame and terror of the world&quot;. Calamandrei&#x27;s poem appears on monuments in the towns of [[Cuneo]], [[Montepulciano]] and [[Sant&#x27;Anna di Stazzema]].

Kesselring&#x27;s memoirs were published in 1953, as (&quot;A Soldier to the Last Day&quot;). The English edition was published a year later as &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Record&quot;. Kesselring&#x27;s contentions that the Luftwaffe was not defeated in the air in the Battle of Britain and that [[Operation Sea Lion]]—the invasion of Britain—was thought about, but never seriously planned, were controversial. During the 1950s, in the absence of other sources, military historians often used memoirs as sources. An important flaw in his memoirs was a reluctance to criticise others, to the extent of representing decisions with which he strongly disagreed at the time as being the product of consensus.

The book sold well, but critics were cautious. While recognising his talents as a general, noted that Kesselring &quot;clearly never posed himself the question: &#x27;Where does blind obedience end and a sense of responsibility start to take effect, if not at the highest levels of command?&#x27;&quot; Reviewing the English edition, Lieutenant General [[Lucian Truscott|Lucian K. Truscott Jr.]], who had commanded the US [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]], [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] and Fifth Army in Italy, reviewed the book for &quot;[[The New York Times]]&quot;. He noted the esteem in which Kesselring was held by his enemies, but also the &quot;thread of self-justification for the indifference of himself and fellow officers to Nazi excesses.&quot; In 1955, Kesselring published a second book, (&quot;Thoughts on the Second World War&quot;).
Kesselring protested what he regarded as the &quot;unjustly smirched reputation of the German soldier&quot;. In November 1953, testifying at a war crimes trial, he warned that &quot;there won&#x27;t be any volunteers for the new German army if the German government continues to try German soldiers for acts committed in World War II&quot;. He enthusiastically supported the European Defence Community and suggested that the &quot;war opponents of yesterday must become the peace comrades and friends of tomorrow&quot;. On the other hand, he also declared that he found &quot;astonishing&quot; those who believe &quot;that we must revise our ideas in accordance with democratic principles ... That is more than I can take.&quot;

In March 1954, Kesselring and Liny toured Austria, ostensibly as private citizens. He met with former comrades-in-arms and prison-mates, some of them former SS members, causing embarrassment to the Austrian government, which ordered his deportation. He ignored the order and completed his tour, before leaving a week later, as he had intended. His only official government service was on the Medals Commission, which was established by [[President of Germany|President]] [[Theodor Heuss]]. Ultimately, the commission unanimously recommended that medals should be permitted to be worn—but without the [[swastika]]. He was an expert witness for the &quot;Generals&#x27; Trials&quot;. The Generals&#x27; Trials were trials of German citizens before German courts for crimes committed in Germany, the most prominent of which was that of [[Ferdinand Schörner]].

Kesselring died in a [[sanatorium]] at [[Bad Nauheim]] in West Germany, on 16 July 1960 at the age of 74, following a [[heart attack]]. He was given a quasi-military funeral and buried in Bergfriedhof Cemetery in [[Bad Wiessee]]. Members of acted as his pallbearers and fired a rifle volley over his grave. His former chief of staff, [[Siegfried Westphal]], spoke for the veterans of North Africa and Italy, describing Kesselring as &quot;a man of admirable strength of character whose care was for soldiers of all ranks&quot;. [[Josef Kammhuber]] spoke on behalf of the and , expressing the hope that Kesselring would be remembered for his earlier accomplishments rather than for his later activities. Also present were the former [[Sepp Dietrich]], ex-Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], Schörner, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, [[Otto Remer]], [[Joachim Peiper]] and Rahn.

In 2000, a memorial event was held in Bad Wiessee marking the fortieth anniversary of Kesselring&#x27;s death. No representatives of the attended, on the grounds that Kesselring was &quot;not worthy of being part of our tradition&quot;. Instead, two veterans groups, the (German Monte Cassino Association) and the (Association of German Paratroopers), took on the task of remembering Kesselring. To his ageing troops, Kesselring remained a commander to be commemorated.

===Baton===
Kesselring&#x27;s ″s baton was seized by a private serving as a scout with the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|US 2nd Armored Division]], the first US division to enter Berlin, in July 1945. He was ordered to search castles that had been used by high-ranking German officers and found the baton. It remained in his possession until his death in 1977, when it passed to his widow, and then to his son, who put it up for auction by Alex Cooper auctioneers in 2010. Expected to fetch between US$10,000 and $15,000, it was sold to a private bidder for $731,600.

<doc id="200386" wikidata="Q7859441" url="?curid=200386" title="Two pound coin">
<text>The British two pound coin (£2) is a denomination of sterling coinage. Its obverse has featured the profile of Queen Elizabeth II since the coin’s release. Three different portraits of the Queen have been used, with the current design by Jody Clark being introduced in 2015. The reverse design features Britannia.

The coin was released on 15 June 1998 (coins minted 1997) after a review of the United Kingdom&#x27;s coinage decided that a general-circulation £2 coin was needed. The new bi-metallic coin design replaced a series of commemorative, uni-metallic coins which were issued between 1986 and 1996 to celebrate special occasions. Although legal tender, those earlier coins had never been common in everyday circulation.

As of March 2014 there were an estimated 417 million £2 coins in circulation with an estimated face value of £834 million.

Beyond the usual commemorative versions, no standard two pound coins have been minted for general circulation since 2016, although examples have been issued in uncirculated sets at a premium. This was because the concurrent introduction of the new version of the one pound coin had put enough £2 (and 20 pence) coins back into circulation, as people emptied coin jars primarily for the older one pound coin that was due to be withdrawn.

£2 coins are legal tender to any amount when offered in repayment of a debt; however, the coin&#x27;s legal tender status is not normally relevant for everyday transactions.

==Design==

The original reverse of the coin, designed by Bruce Rushin, is an abstract design symbolising the history of technological achievement, accompanied by the words above, and the year of minting below.
This was the first bi-metallic coin to be produced for circulation in Britain since the tin farthing with a copper plug produced in 1692, and is the highest-denomination coin in common circulation in the UK. The coin consists of an outer yellow metal nickel-brass ring made from 76% copper, 20% zinc, and 4% nickel, and an inner steel-coloured cupro-nickel disc made from 75% copper, 25% nickel. The coin weighs and is in diameter.

The design itself was first tried out in 1994 when the Royal Mint produced a short run of demonstration pieces to the new bi-metal standard. These pieces were not for circulation and were simply intended to test the manufacturing process. The coin was technically similar to the version which eventually entered circulation with the Maklouf effigy of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse and the image of a sailing ship similar to that previously used on the reverse of the pre-decimal halfpenny piece. The inscription on the reverse read with an edge inscription based on the one pound coin which read , meaning &quot;An ornament and a safeguard – [in the] 46th year of [her] reign&quot;. The 1994 pieces were never legal tender but were eventually released for sale as part of a presentation set in 1998. At the same time in 1994 the Royal Mint produced a mono-metallic trial two-pound coin, with the same ship reverse and inscription, but otherwise similar to the earlier commemorative coins. These were never issued in presentation sets, and so are much scarcer than the bi-metallic version.

Because of technical difficulties, the 1997-dated coins, which bear the effigy of Queen Elizabeth II by Raphael Maklouf, were not released to circulation until June 1998 (the same time as the 1998-dated coins). Coins dated 1998 and later bear the effigy of the Queen by Ian Rank-Broadley. The Maklouf-effigy coins bear the inscription on the obverse; the Rank-Broadley coins bear the inscription .

The reverse of the regular-issue coin, designed by Bruce Rushin, bears a concentric design symbolically representing technological development from the Iron Age, through the Industrial Revolution and the Electronic Age to the Internet, with the inscription above the design and the date below. An oddity of the design is that it depicts nineteen interlocking gears. Because there is an odd number of them, the mechanism could not actually turn. The coin has the edge inscription , a quote taken from a letter by Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke, in which he describes how his work was built on the knowledge of those that had gone before him. &quot;If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.&quot; Newton was Warden and later Master of the Royal Mint.

In February 2015, the Royal Mint announced that a new design featuring Britannia by Antony Dufort would replace the previous design. The new coins feature the edge inscription , meaning &quot;I claim the four seas&quot;, an inscription previously featured on coins bearing the image of Britannia.

In October 2023 the King Charles III two-pound coin was presented; the coin features the national flowers – a rose for England, a daffodil for Wales, a thistle for Scotland and a shamrock for Northern Ireland. The coin has the edge inscription (&quot;In the service of all&quot;), taken from the King&#x27;s inaugural speech in September 2022.

==Variants==

In addition to the standard designs there have been several variant reverse designs used on the £2 coin to commemorate important events. These are summarised in the table below.



== &quot;Inverted effigy&quot; coins ==
In 2015, a small number of £2 coins entered circulation that featured the Queen’s head rotated clockwise by approximately 150 degrees. The Royal Mint stated that the misalignment of the Queen’s effigy was &quot;almost certainly the result of one of the dies working loose and rotating during the striking process&quot;. Change Checker, a coin dealing website, suggests that the rotated die may have affected as few as around 3,250 coins.

<text>Georg Friedrich Creuzer (; 10 March 1771 – 6 February 1858) was a German philologist and archaeologist.

== Life ==

He was born at Marburg, the son of a bookbinder. After studying at Marburg and at the University of Jena, he went to Leipzig as a private tutor; but in 1802 he was appointed professor at Marburg, and two years later professor of philology and ancient history at Heidelberg. He held the latter position for nearly forty-five years, with the exception of a short time spent at the University of Leiden, where his health was affected by the Dutch climate.

Creuzer was one of the principal founders of the Philological Seminary established at Heidelberg in 1807. The Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, Paris, appointed him one of its members, and from the Grand Duke of Baden he received the dignity of privy councillor. In 1844 Creuzer received a medal for his 40th anniversary of employment at the University of Heidelberg. This medal was made by the engraver Ludwig Kachel.

== Works ==
Creuzer&#x27;s first and most famous work was his &quot;Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker, besonders der Griechen&quot; (1810–12, 2nd ed. 1819, 3rd ed. 1837), in which he maintained that the mythology of Homer and Hesiod came from an Eastern source through the Pelasgians, and reflected the symbolism of an ancient revelation; as a reconciliation with Judeo-Christian religion, it was, Walter Burkert has said, &quot;the last large-scale and thoroughly unavailing endeavor of this kind.&quot;

This work ran counter to the ideology of romantic nationalism, which held literature and culture to be intimately connected with a &quot;Volk&quot;, epitomized by Karl Otfried Müller&#x27;s concept of a Greek &quot;Stammeskultur&quot;, a Greek &quot;tribal culture&quot;. For this and the next generations, &quot;origins and organic development rather than reciprocal cultural influences became the key to understanding.&quot;

Creuzer&#x27;s work was vigorously attacked by Johann Gottfried Jakob Hermann in his &quot;Briefen über Homer und Hesiod&quot;, and in his letter, addressed to Creuzer, &quot;Über das Wesen und die Behandlung der Mythologie&quot;; by Johann Heinrich Voss in his &quot;Antisymbolik&quot;; and by Christian Lobeck in his &quot;Aglaophamus&quot;. It was briefly praised, however, by Hegel in his &quot;Philosophy of Right&quot;.

Creuzer&#x27;s other works include:
*an edition of Plotinus
*a partial edition of Cicero, in preparing which he was assisted by Moser
*&quot;Epochen der griechischen Literaturgeschichte&quot; (1802)
*&quot;Die historische Kunst der Griechen&quot; (1803)
*&quot;Abriss der römischen Antiquitaten&quot; (1824)
*&quot;Zur Geschichte altrömischer Cultur am Oberrhein und Neckar&quot; (1833)
*&quot;Zur Gemmenkunde&quot; (1834)
*&quot;Das Mithreum von Neuenheim&quot; (1838)
*&quot;Zur Galerie der alten Dramatiker&quot; (1839)
*&quot;Zur Geschichte der classischen Philologie&quot; (1854).

See the autobiographical &quot;Aus dem Leben eines alten Professors&quot; (Leipzig and Darmstadt, 1848), to which was added in the year of his death &quot;Paralipomena der Lebenskunde eines alten Professors&quot; (Frankfurt, 1858); also Starck, &quot;Friederich Kreuzer, sein Bildungsgang und seine bleibende Bedeutung&quot; (Heidelberg, 1875).

<text>SS-N-22 Sunburn is the NATO reporting name for two unrelated Soviet anti-ship missiles. Although the missiles were very different, distinguishing between them is difficult because their ship-mounted launching containers were identical. Confusion was exacerbated by the Soviet practice of mixing missile types within a class of ships. It was therefore not confirmed that the &quot;SS-N-22&quot; actually referenced two different missiles until after the fall of the Soviet Union.

== Chelomei rocket ==
One of the SS-N-22s was the P-80 Zubr, designed by a team led by Vladimir Chelomei. The Zubr was rocket-propelled and armed with a 250 kilogram warhead. It was carried by early-model &quot;Sovremenny&quot;-class destroyers and &quot;Tarantul&quot;-class corvettes. The submarine-launched version of this missile was also designated as an SS-N-22 Sunburn by NATO but was known to the Soviets as the P-100 Oniks.

== MKB Raduga model ==

The other, unrelated SS-N-22 was the Raduga P-270 Moskit. It was ramjet-propelled (though launched by a small solid-fuel rocket), and was carried by later-model Sovremenny class destroyers, Tarantul class corvettes, and several smaller warships. This weapon has a top speed of Mach 3. The high speed of the missile means a typical response time for the target of only 25 to 30 seconds, giving a target little time to react. Moskit can be armed with a warhead of 320 kg.

Another version of this weapon is called the ASM-MMS or Kh-41; it is intended to be launched by a Su-33.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China acquired SS-N-22 launchers and missiles (specifically, the for-export 3M-80E Moskit variant) with a 1999–2000 purchase of two &quot;Sovremenny&quot; destroyers from Russia.According to Russia, the PRC funded the development of the SS-N-22 version for the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). It has the designation 3M-80MBE, and this version differs from earlier versions mainly in having increased range (now beyond 220 km; 240 km has been quoted). These new missiles will be first installed on board the second pair of Sovremenny class destroyers. A total of 500 SS-N-22 AShM were ordered by the PRC for the four Russian-built Sovremenny class destroyers. With the exception of the first 20, these are the 3M-80MBE variant. The PRC has stockpiled roughly 15 SS-N-22 missiles per launch tube (each destroyer having a total of 8 launchers in two quadruple configurations). It is speculated that the PLAN intends to use the missiles against carrier battle groups deployed by the United States Navy in the event of a confrontation with the Republic of China (Taiwan).

Six SS-N-22 launchers were also present on the Soviet ekranoplan &quot;Lun&quot;.

<doc id="200391" wikidata="Q791000" url="?curid=200391" title="Concerto for Orchestra (Bartók)">
<text>The Concerto for Orchestra, Sz. 116, BB 123, is a five-movement orchestral work composed by Béla Bartók in 1943. It is one of his best-known, most popular, and most accessible works.

The score is inscribed &quot;15 August – 8 October 1943&quot;. It was premiered on December 1, 1944, in Symphony Hall, Boston, by the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Serge Koussevitzky. It was a great success and has been regularly performed since.

It is perhaps the best-known of a number of pieces that have the apparently contradictory title &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot;. This is in contrast to the conventional concerto form, which features a solo instrument with orchestral accompaniment. Bartók said that he called the piece a concerto rather than a symphony because of the way each section of instruments is treated in a soloistic and virtuosic way.

==Composition==
The work was written in response to a commission from the Koussevitzky Foundation (run by the conductor Serge Koussevitzky) following Bartók&#x27;s move to the United States from his native Hungary, which he had fled because of World War II. It has been speculated that Bartók&#x27;s previous work, the String Quartet No. 6 (1939), could well have been his last were it not for this commission, which sparked a small number of other compositions, including his Sonata for Solo Violin and Piano Concerto No. 3.

Bartók revised the piece in February 1945, the biggest change coming in the last movement, where he wrote a longer ending. Both versions of the ending were published, but the revised ending is almost universally performed.

In 1943, while Bartok was in hospital, suffering from what would later be discovered to be leukemia, he was visited by Serge Koussevitzky who wanted to inform him of the commission for him to write the work which
would become this concerto.

==Musical analysis==

The piece is in five movements:
Bartók makes extensive use of classical elements in the work; for instance, the first and fifth movements are in sonata-allegro form.

The work combines elements of Western art music and eastern European folk music, especially that of Hungary, and it departs from traditional tonality, often using non-traditional modes and artificial scales. Bartók researched folk melodies, and their influence is felt throughout the work. For example, the second main theme of the first movement, as played by the first oboe, resembles a folk melody, with its narrow range and almost haphazard rhythm. The drone in the horns and strings also indicates folk influence (see example).

=== I. Introduzione ===
The first movement, Introduzione, consists of a slow introduction, presenting the main material (consecutive intervals of fourths, scale fragments, mirror ideas etc. leading to an &quot;allegro&quot; with numerous fugato passages. The quick part is in sonata-allegro form.

===II. Presentando le coppie===
The second movement is called &quot;Game of Pairs&quot; (but see note below). Its main part consists of five sections, each thematically distinct from the others, with a different pair of instruments playing together in each section. In each passage, a different interval separates the pair—bassoons are a minor sixth apart, oboes are in minor thirds, clarinets in minor sevenths, flutes in fifths, and muted trumpets in major seconds. The movement prominently features a side drum that taps out a rhythm at the beginning and end of this part. In fact this main part is played twice. Careful listening will reveal some small differences when it is played the second time. In between the first and second playing of this part there is a short interlude which to some listeners (including some who write cover notes for recordings of this work) suggests a kind of marriage ceremony. 
So one can imagine that, when the main part is played a second time, the five couples that appeared earlier are now married.

While the printed score titles the second movement &quot;Giuoco delle coppie&quot; or &quot;Game of the couples&quot;, Bartók&#x27;s manuscript had no title at all for this movement at the time the engraving-copy blueprint was made for the publisher. At some later date, Bartók added the words &quot;Presentando le coppie&quot; or &quot;Presentation of the couples&quot; to the manuscript and the addition of this title was included in the list of corrections to be made to the score. However, in Bartók&#x27;s file blueprint the final title is found, and because it is believed to have been the composer&#x27;s later thought, it is retained in the revised edition of the score.

The original 1946 printed score also had an incorrect metronome marking for this movement. This was brought to light by Sir Georg Solti as he was preparing to record the piece with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1980:
Despite Solti&#x27;s assertion that thousands of earlier performances had been played at the wrong speed, both of Fritz Reiner&#x27;s recordings – his 1946 recording with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (the first recording of the work), as well as his 1955 recording with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (the same orchestra whose side drum player called the matter to Solti&#x27;s attention) – had been played at the speed (crotchet equals 94) that Solti later recommended. Reiner had known Bartok since 1905, when they were fellow students at the Budapest Academy. And years later, in 1943, it was Reiner, along with Joseph Szigeti, who persuaded Serge Koussevitsky to commission Bartok to write the Concerto for Orchestra.

===III. Elegia===
The third movement, &quot;Elegia&quot;, is another slow movement, typical of Bartók&#x27;s so-called &quot;Night music&quot;. The movement revolves around three themes which derive primarily from the first movement.

===IV. Intermezzo interrotto===
The fourth movement, &quot;Intermezzo interrotto&quot; (literally &quot;interrupted intermezzo&quot;), consists of a flowing melody with changing time signatures, intermixed with a theme that quotes the song &quot;Da geh&#x27; ich zu Maxim&quot; from Franz Lehár&#x27;s operetta &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, which had recently also been referenced in the &#x27;invasion&#x27; theme of Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 7 &quot;Leningrad&quot;. Whether Bartók was parodying Lehár, Shostakovich, or both has been hotly disputed, without any clinching evidence either way. The theme is itself interrupted by glissandi on the trombones and woodwinds.

&lt;/score&gt;

In this movement, the timpani are featured when the second theme is introduced, requiring 10 different pitches of the timpani over the course of 20 seconds. The general structure is &quot;ABA–interruption–BA.&quot;

===V. Finale===
The fifth movement, marked &quot;presto&quot;, consists of a whirling perpetuum mobile main theme competing with fugato fireworks and folk melodies. This is also in sonata-allegro form.

==Piano reduction==

In 1985, Peter Bartók, son of the composer, discovered a manuscript of a piano, two-hands reduction of the score, in the large body of material which had been left to him upon his father&#x27;s death. This version had been prepared for rehearsals of a ballet interpretation of the Concerto, to be performed by the Ballet Theatre in New York. This performance never took place, and the piano score was shelved. Soon after the discovery of this manuscript, Peter Bartók asked the Hungarian pianist György Sándor to prepare the manuscript for publication and performance. The world premiere recording of this edited reduction was made by György Sándor in 1987, on CBS Masterworks: the CD also includes piano versions of the Dance Suite, Sz. 77 and Petite Suite, Sz. 105, which was adapted from some of the 44 Violin Duos.

<text>The malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) is a stocky ground-dwelling Australian bird about the size of a domestic chicken (to which it is distantly related). It is notable for the large nesting mounds constructed by the males and lack of parental care after the chicks hatch. It is the only living representative of the genus &quot;Leipoa&quot;, though the extinct giant malleefowl was a close relative.

==Behaviour==

Malleefowl are shy, wary, solitary birds that usually fly only to escape danger or reach a tree to roost in. Although very active, they are seldom seen as they freeze if disturbed, relying on their intricately patterned plumage to render them invisible, or else fade silently and rapidly into the undergrowth (flying away only if surprised or chased). They have many tactics to run away from predators.

===Breeding===
Pairs occupy a territory, but usually roost and feed apart; their social behaviour is sufficient to allow regular mating during the season and little else.

In winter, the male selects an area of ground, usually a small, open space between the stunted trees of the mallee, and scrapes a depression about across and just under deep in the sandy soil by raking backwards with his feet. In late winter and early spring, he begins to collect organic material to fill it with, scraping sticks, leaves, and bark into windrows for up to around the hole, and building it into a nest mound, which usually rises to about above ground level. The amount of litter in the mound varies; it may be almost entirely organic material, mostly sand, or any ratio in between.

After rain, he turns and mixes the material to encourage decay, and if conditions allow, digs an egg chamber in August (the last month of the southern winter). The female sometimes assists with the excavation of the egg chamber, and the timing varies with temperature and rainfall. The female usually lays between September and February, provided enough rain has fallen to start organic decay of the litter. The male continues to maintain the nest mound, gradually adding more soil to the mix as the summer approaches (presumably to regulate the temperature).
Males usually build their first mound (or take over an existing one) in their fourth year, but tend not to achieve as impressive a structure as older birds. They are thought to mate for life, and although the males stay nearby to defend the nests for nine months of the year, they can wander at other times, not always returning to the same territory afterwards.

The female lays a clutch of two or three to over 30 large, thin-shelled eggs, mostly about 15; usually about a week apart. Each egg weighs about 10% of the female&#x27;s body weight, and over a season, she commonly lays 250% of her own weight. Clutch size varies greatly between birds and with rainfall. Incubation time depends on temperature and can be between about 50 and almost 100 days.

Hatchlings use their strong feet to break out of the egg, then lie on their backs and scratch their way to the surface, struggling hard for 5 to 10 minutes to gain at a time, and then resting for an hour or so before starting again. Reaching the surface takes between 2 and 15 hours. Chicks pop out of the nesting material with little or no warning, with eyes and beaks tightly closed, then immediately take a deep breath and open their eyes, before freezing motionless for as long as 20 minutes.
The chick then quickly emerges from the hole and rolls or staggers to the base of the mound, disappearing into the scrub within moments. Within an hour, it will be able to run reasonably well; it can flutter for a short distance and run very fast within two hours, and despite not having yet grown tail feathers, it can fly strongly within a day.

Chicks have no contact with adults or other chicks; they tend to hatch one at a time, and birds of any age ignore one another except for mating or territorial disputes.

==Distribution and habitat==
It occupies semiarid mallee scrub on the fringes of the relatively fertile areas of southern Australia, where it is now reduced to three separate populations: the Murray–Murrumbidgee basin, west of Spencer Gulf along the fringes of the Simpson Desert, and the semiarid fringe of Western Australia&#x27;s fertile southwest corner.

===Important bird areas===
Several important bird areas across southern mainland Australia have been identified by BirdLife International as being significant for malleefowl conservation:

====New South Wales====
* Central NSW Mallee
* Goonoo
* Southern NSW Mallee

====South Australia====
* Gawler Ranges
* Gum Lagoon
* Peebinga
* Riverland Mallee
* Southern Yorke Peninsula

====Victoria====
* Little Desert
* Murray-Sunset, Hattah and Annuello
* Wandown
* Wyperfeld, Big Desert and Ngarkat

====Western Australia====

* Dragon Rocks
* Dunn Rock and Lake King
* Fitzgerald River
* Holleton
* Karara and Lochada
* Karroun Hill
* Lake Magenta
* Mount Gibson and Charles Darwin
* Yeelirrie Station

==Conservation status==
Across its range, the malleefowl is considered to be threatened. Predation from the introduced red fox is a factor, but the critical issues are changed fire regimens and the ongoing destruction and habitat fragmentation. Like the southern hairy-nose wombat, it is particularly vulnerable to the increasing frequency and severity of drought that has resulted from climate change. Before the arrival of Europeans, the malleefowl was found over huge swaths of Australia.

===International===
The malleefowl is classified as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List.

===Australia===
Malleefowl are listed as vulnerable on the Australian &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot;. Its conservation status has varied over time, and also varies from state to state within Australia. For example:

* The malleefowl is listed as threatened on the Victorian &quot;Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988)&quot;. Under this Act, an &quot;Action Statement&quot; for the recovery and future management of this species has been prepared.
* On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the malleefowl is listed as endangered.
* The malleefowl is listed as vulnerable on schedule 8 of the South Australian &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot;.
* Malleefowl are listed as endangered on the New South Wales &quot;Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995&quot;.

==Yongergnow Australian Malleefowl Centre==
The Yongergnow Australian Malleefowl Centre is located at Ongerup, Western Australia, on the road between Albany and Esperance. The centre opened in February 2007 and is intended to provide a focal point for education about the malleefowl and the conservation of the species. It has a permanent exhibition and a large aviary containing a pair of malleefowl. The centre collects reported sightings of the malleefowl.

<text>Although a concerto is usually a piece of music for one or more solo instruments accompanied by a full orchestra, several composers have written works with the apparently contradictory title Concerto for Orchestra. This title is usually chosen to emphasise soloistic and treatment of various individual instruments or sections in the orchestra, with emphasis on instruments changing during the piece. It differs from sinfonia concertante in that it has no soloist or group of soloists that remains the same throughout the composition.

A well known concerto for orchestra is Béla Bartók&#x27;s Concerto for Orchestra (1943), although the title had been used several times before. Goffredo Petrassi made the concerto for orchestra something of a speciality, writing eight of them since 1933. He finished the last one in 1972.

<text>Johann Heinrich Voss (German: Voß, ; 20 February 1751 – 29 March 1826) was a German classicist and poet, known mostly for his translation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; (1781) and &quot;Iliad&quot; (1793) into German.

==Life==
Voss was born at Sommersdorf in Mecklenburg-Strelitz as the son of a farmer. After attending the Gymnasium at Neubrandenburg from 1766 to 1769, he was obliged to accept a private tutorship in order to earn money to enable him to study at a university.

At the invitation of Heinrich Christian Boie, whose attention he had attracted by poems contributed to the &quot;Göttinger Musenalmanach&quot;, he went to the University of Göttingen in 1772. Here he studied philology, his studies encompassing both classical and modern languages, and became one of the leading spirits in the Göttinger Hainbund. In 1775 Boie made over to him the editorship of the &quot;Musenalmanach&quot;, which he continued to issue for several years. He married Boie&#x27;s sister Ernestine in 1777.

In 1778 Voss was appointed rector of the school at Otterndorf. In 1781, after the publication of several treatises, he produced a German-language text for Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. This work made the poem national with the Germans (new ed. by Bernays, 1881).

In 1782, Voss accepted the rectorship of the gymnasium at Eutin. There, in 1789, he published translations of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot; and &quot;Georgics&quot;. In 1793, his translation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; appeared, along with the &quot;Odyssey&quot; in a new form. He also produced two volumes of controversial letters addressed to Christian Gottlob Heyne (&quot;Mythologische Briefe&quot;, 1794).

He retired from Eutin in 1802 with a pension of 600 thalers, and settled at Jena. In 1805, although Johann Wolfgang von Goethe used his utmost endeavours to persuade him to stay, Voss accepted a call to a professorship of classical literature at the University of Heidelberg. Here, in the enjoyment of a considerable salary, he devoted himself entirely to his literary labours, translations and antiquarian research until his death.

==Work==

===Poetry and essays===

Voss was a man of a remarkably independent and vigorous character. From 1785 to 1795 he published in two volumes a collection of original poems, to which he afterwards made many additions. An edition of his poems in four volumes was issued in 1825. Of these original works, the idyllic poem &quot;Luise&quot; is uniformly singled out as his most successful. It was first printed in 1783, and reissued with changes in 1795. In this work, he sought to apply the style and methods of classical poetry to the expression of modern German thought and sentiment. The later works &quot;Wie ward Fritz Stolberg ein Unfreier&quot; (1819) and &quot;Antisymbolik&quot; (2 volumes, 1824–1826), the latter written in opposition to Georg Friedrich Creuzer, have been characterized as painstaking and dignified, but dreary.

His poems were often set by contemporary composers such as C. P. E. Bach, Johann Friedrich Reichardt, and Johann Abraham Peter Schulz, and also later composers such as Felix Mendelssohn, Carl Maria von Weber, and Johannes Brahms. Many of his poems and settings of them were published in the &quot;Musenalmanach&quot;. Based on his correspondence with Schulz, he favored a folklike style of Lied composition.

Voss&#x27;s &quot;Mythologische Briefe&quot;, his &quot;Antisymbolik&quot;, and other writings made important contributions to the study of mythology. He was also prominent as an advocate of the right of free judgment in religion, and at the time when some members of the Romantic school were being converted to the Roman Catholic Church, he produced a strong impression by a powerful article, in Heinrich Paulus&#x27;s journal &quot;Sophronizon&quot;, on his friend Friedrich von Stolberg&#x27;s repudiation of Protestantism (1819).

===Translations===
It is, however, as a translator that Voss chiefly owes his place in German literature. His translations indicate not only sound scholarship but a thorough mastery of the laws of German diction and rhythm. The most famous of his translations are those of Homer. The translation of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, as originally issued in 1781, is singled out as the most successful. He also translated Hesiod (1806), Theocritus, Bion and Moschus (1808), the whole of Virgil (1799, rev. ed. 1821), Horace (1806), Tibullus (1810), Propertius (1830) and selections from Ovid (1798). He prepared a critical edition of Tibullus. From 1818 to 1829, a translation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in 9 volumes was published. This work Voss completed with the help of his sons and , both of whom were scholars and writers of considerable ability, though the result has been characterized as less successful than Schlegel&#x27;s work.

Voss&#x27;s &quot;Sämtliche poetische Werke&quot; were published by his son Abraham in 1835; new ed. 1850. A selection is in A. Sauer, &quot;Der Göttinger Dichterbund&quot;, volume i. (Joseph Kürschner&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche National-literatur&quot;, vol. 49, 1887). His &quot;Letters&quot; were published by his son in 3 or 4 volumes (Halberstadt, 1829–1833). Voss left a short autobiography, &quot;Abriß meines Lebens&quot; (1818). See also , &quot;Johann Heinrich Voß&quot; (3 volumes, Leipzig, 1872–1876); Friedrich Heussner, &quot;Johann Heinrich Voß als Schulmann in Eutin. Festschrift zum hundertjährigen Gedenktage seiner Ankunft daselbst&quot; (1882); and another life by Paulus (Heidelberg, 1826); also Robert Prutz, &quot;Der Göttinger Dichterbund&quot; (Leipzig, 1841).

According to &quot;Bartlett&#x27;s Familiar Quotations&quot;, Voss is the most likely source for the phrase , or, in English, &quot;wine, women and song&quot;. Voss&#x27;s full phrase is (&quot;He who loves not wine, woman and song / Remains a fool his whole life long&quot;).

<text>Heinrich Christian Boie (19 July 1744 – 3 March 1806) was a German author. In 1781, he was appointed as &quot;landfoged&quot; of North Dithmarschen.

==Biography==
He was born at Meldorf in Holstein (at the time a part of the Danish monarchy). After studying law at Jena, he went in 1769 to Göttingen, where he became one of the leading spirits in the Göttingen &quot;Dichterbund&quot; or &quot;Hain.&quot; Boie&#x27;s poetic talent was mediocre, but his thorough knowledge of literature, his taste and judgment, made him an inspiration to others.

Together with FW Gotter he founded in 1770 the &quot;Göttingen Musenalmanach&quot;, which he directed and edited until 1775, when, in conjunction with CW von Dohm (1751–1820), he brought out &quot;Das deutsche Museum&quot;, which became one of the best literary periodicals of the day. In 1776 Boie became secretary to the commander-in-chief at Hanover, and in 1781 was appointed administrator of the province of Süderditmarschen in Holstein. He died at Meldorf.

In 1781, he was appointed as &quot;landfoged&quot; of North Dithmarschen.

<doc id="200401" wikidata="Q274681" url="?curid=200401" title="Éliphas Lévi">
<text>Éliphas Lévi Zahed, born Alphonse Louis Constant (8 February 1810 – 31 May 1875), was a French esotericist, poet, and writer. Initially pursuing an ecclesiastical career in the Catholic Church, he abandoned the priesthood in his mid-twenties and became a ceremonial magician. At the age of 40, he began professing knowledge of the occult. He wrote over 20 books on magic, Kabbalah, alchemical studies, and occultism.

The pen name &quot;Éliphas Lévi&quot;, was a transliteration of his given names &quot;Alphonse Louis&quot; into Hebrew. Levi gained renown as an original thinker and writer, his works attracting attention in Paris and London among esotericists and artists of romantic or symbolist inspiration. He left the Grand Orient de France (the French Masonic organization that originated Continental Freemasonry) in the belief that the original meanings of its symbols and rituals had been lost. &quot;I ceased being a freemason, at once, because the Freemasons, excommunicated by the Pope, did not believe in tolerating Catholicism ... [and] the essence of Freemasonry is the tolerance of all beliefs.&quot;

Many authors influenced Levi&#x27;s political, occultic and literary development, such as the French monarchist Joseph de Maistre (whom he quotes in many parts of his &quot;Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie&quot;), Paracelsus, Robert Fludd, Swedenborg, Fabre d&#x27;Olivet, the Rosicrucians, Plato, Raymond Lull, and other esotericists.

==Life==
===Early period===
Born Alphonse Louis Constant, he was the son of a shoemaker in Paris. In 1832 he entered the seminary of Saint Sulpice to study to enter the Roman Catholic priesthood. As a sub-deacon he was responsible for catechism. Later he was ordained a deacon, remaining a cleric for the rest of his life. One week before being ordained to the priesthood, he decided to leave the priestly path; however, the spirit of charity and the life he had in the seminary stayed with him through the rest of his life. Later he wrote that he had acquired an understanding of faith and science without conflicts.

In 1836, on leaving the priestly path, he provoked his superiors&#x27; anger. He had committed to permanent vows of chastity and obedience as a sub-deacon and deacon, so returning to civil life was particularly painful for him; he continued to wear the clerical clothes, the cassocks, until 1844.

The possible reasons that saw Levi&#x27;s departure from the Saint-Sulpice seminary, in 1836, are expressed in the following quote, by A. E. Waite: &quot;He [Levi] seems, however, to have conceived strange views on doctrinal subjects, though no particulars are forthcoming, and, being deficient in gifts of silence, the displeasure of authority was marked by various checks, ending finally in his expulsion from the Seminary. Such is one story at least, but an alternative says more simply that he relinquished the sacerdotal career in consequence of doubts and scruples.&quot;

He had to obviate extreme poverty by working as a tutor in Paris. Around 1838, he met and was influenced by the views of the mystic Simon Ganneau, and it may have been through Ganneau&#x27;s meetings that he also met Flora Tristan. In 1839 he entered the monastic life in the Abbey of Solesmes, but he could not maintain the discipline so he quit the monastery.

Upon returning to Paris, he wrote, &quot;La Bible de la liberté&quot; (The Bible of Liberty), which resulted in his imprisonment in August 1841.

The Eliphas Levi Circle (&quot;(Association law 1901) was set up on April 1 1975&quot;) gives the following summary of Levi&#x27;s marriage and paternity: &quot;At the age of 32 he met two young girls who were friends, Eugénie C and Noémie Cadiot. Despite his preference for Eugenie he also fell under the spell of Noémie whom he was obliged to marry in 1846 in order to avoid a confrontation with the girl’s father. Seven years later Noémie ran away from the marital home to join the marquis of Montferriet and in 1865 the marriage was annulled. Several children issued from this marriage, in particular twins who died shortly after birth. None of these children reached adult age, little Marie for example, who died when she was seven. Lévi had an illegitimate son with Eugénie C, born 29 September 1846, but the child never bore Lévi’s name. However he did know his father, who saw that he was educated. We know from reliable sources that the descendants of this son are living among us in France today.&quot;

Writing at the beginning of the 20th century, A. E. Waite depicts Levi&#x27;s marriage, perished offspring, and (possible) violation of the Saint Sulpice seminary rule, as follows:

Unexpectedly, in 1850, at the age of 40, Levi succumbed to a period of heightened financial and spiritual crisis, leading him, more profoundly, to find refuge in the milieu of mid-19th-century esotericism and the occult.

===Later period===
In December 1851, Napoleon III organized a coup that would end the Second Republic and give rise to the Second Empire. Lévi saw the emperor as the defender of the people and the restorer of public order. In the &quot;Moniteur parisien&quot; of 1852, Lévi praised the new government&#x27;s actions, but he soon became disillusioned with the rigid dictatorship and was eventually imprisoned in 1855 for publishing a polemical chanson against the Emperor. What had changed, however, was Lévi&#x27;s attitude towards &quot;the people.&quot; As early as in &quot;La Fête-Dieu&quot; and &quot;Le livre des larmes&quot; from 1845, he had been skeptical of the uneducated people&#x27;s ability to emancipate themselves. Similar to the Saint-Simonians, he had adopted the theocratic ideas of Joseph de Maistre in order to call for the establishment of a &quot;spiritual authority&quot; led by an élite class of priests. After the disaster of 1849, he was completely convinced that the &quot;masses&quot; were not able to establish a harmonious order and needed instruction.

Lévi&#x27;s activities reflect the struggle to come to terms, both with the failure of 1848 and the tough repressions by the new government. He participated on the &quot;Revue philosophique et religieuse&quot;, founded by his old friend Fauvety, wherein he propagated his &quot;Kabbalistic&quot; ideas, for the first time in public, in 1855-1856 (notably using his civil name).

Lévi began to write &quot;Histoire de la magie&quot; in 1860. The following year, in 1861, he published a sequel to &quot;Dogme et rituel&quot;, &quot;La clef des grands mystères&quot; (&quot;The Key to the Great Mysteries&quot;). In 1861 Lévi revisited London. Further magical works by Lévi include &quot;Fables et symboles&quot; (&quot;Stories and Images&quot;), 1862, &quot;Le sorcier de Meudon&quot; (&quot;The Wizard of Meudon&quot;, an extended edition of two novels originally published in 1847) 1861, and &quot;La science des esprits&quot; (&quot;The Science of Spirits&quot;), 1865. In 1868, he wrote &quot;Le grand arcane, ou l&#x27;occultisme Dévoilé&quot; (&quot;The Great Secret, or Occultism Unveiled&quot;); this, however, was only published posthumously in 1898.

The thesis of magic propagated by Éliphas Lévi was of significant renown, especially after his death. That Spiritualism was popular on both sides of the Atlantic from the 1850s contributed to this success. However, Lévi diverged from spiritualism and criticized it, because he believed only mental images and &quot;astral forces&quot; persisted after an individual died, which could be freely manipulated by skilled magicians, unlike the autonomous spirits that Spiritualism posited.

In regard to the purported supernatural occurrences reported by the practitioners of spiritualism, Levi was obviously credulous. He explained: &quot;The phenomena which quite recently have perturbed America and Europe, those of table-turning and fluidic manifestations, are simply magnetic currents at the beginning of their formation, appeals on the part of Nature inviting us, for the good of humanity, to reconstitute great sympathetic and religious chains.&quot;

His magical teachings were free from obvious fanaticisms, even if they remained rather obscure; and he had nothing to sell (notwithstanding his publications). He did profess himself to be: &quot;A poor and obscure scholar [who] has found the lever of Archimedes, and he offers it to you for the good of humanity alone, asking nothing whatsoever in exchange.&quot; He did not pretend to be the initiate of some ancient or fictitious secret society. He incorporated the Tarot cards into his magical system, and as a result the Tarot has been an important part of the paraphernalia of Western magicians.

He had a deep impact on the magic of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and later on ex–Golden Dawn member Aleister Crowley. He was also the first to declare that a pentagram or five-pointed star with one point down and two points up represents evil, while a pentagram with one point up and two points down represents good. Lévi&#x27;s ideas also influenced Helena Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society.

==As a ceremonial magus==
Of his initial experience with British esotericists, in 1854, Levi wrote: &quot;I had undertaken a journey to London, that I might escape from internal disquietude and devote myself, without interruption, to science. [...] They asked me forthwith to work wonders, as if I were a charlatan, and I was somewhat discouraged, for, to speak frankly, far from being inclined to initiate others into the mysteries of Ceremonial Magic, I had shrunk all along from its illusions and weariness. Moreover, such ceremonies necessitated an equipment which would be expensive and hard to collect. I buried myself therefore in the study of the transcendent Kabbalah, and troubled no further about English adepts.&quot;

It did not take long after his arrival in England, however, before his skills as a reputed magus were earnestly courted; and Levi obliged: An elderly British woman, who, on the agreement to strictest secrecy, &quot;rigorous amongst adepts,&quot; provided him with &quot;a complete magical cabinet&quot; containing the necessary paraphernalia to apply his theories to the practice of magic in England.

==Theory of magic==

In the preface to &quot;The History of Magic&quot;, translator A. E. Waite enumerates what he believed to be the nine key tenets of magic as codified in Levi&#x27;s earlier work, &quot;Doctrine and Ritual of Transcendental Magic&quot;.
They are:
The three chief components of Levi&#x27;s magical thesis were: Astral Light, the Will and the Imagination. Levi did not originate any of these as occult concepts.

Concerning the &quot;Astral Light&quot;, Waite noted: &quot;the Astral Light, which is neither more nor less than the odylic force of Baron Carl Reichenbach, as the French writer [Levi] himself admits substantially, [...]&quot; and: &quot;This force he [Levi] usually terms the Astral Light, a name which is borrowed from Saint-Martin and the French mystics of the eighteenth century.&quot;

Louis Claude de Saint-Martin had used the term &quot;astral&quot; to mean &quot;psychic force&quot;

&quot;Astral Light&quot; was also indebted to the ideas of 18th-century proto-hypnotist, Franz Mesmer: &quot;[Mesmer] evolved the theory of “animal magnetism.” This he held to be a fluid which pervades the universe, but is most active in the human nervous organization, and enables one man, charged with the fluid, to exert a powerful influence over another.&quot;

Astral is an adjective meaning: &quot;Connected to, consisting of, stars.&quot; Levi used the term &quot;Astral&quot;, not only as a synonym for &quot;psychic force&quot;, but because he believed in the ancient and medieval practice of astrology. As Levi wrote himself: &quot;Nothing is indifferent in Nature, a pebble more or less upon a road may crush or profoundly alter the fortunes of the greatest men and even of the greatest empires, much more then the position of a particular star can not be indifferent to the destinies of the child who is being, and who enters by the fact of his birth into the universal harmony of the sidereal [astrological] world.&quot;

&quot;Will&quot; and &quot;Imagination&quot;, as magical agents, were asserted three centuries before Levi, by Paracelsus:

Eliphas Levi cautioned: &quot;The operations of [magic] science are not devoid of danger. Their result may be madness for those who are not established on the base of the supreme, absolute, and infallible reason. They may over-excite the nervous system, producing terrible and incurable diseases.&quot; &quot;Let those, therefore, who seek in magic the means to satisfy their passions, pause in that deadly path, where they will find nothing but death or madness. This is the significance of the vulgar tradition that the devil finished sooner or later by strangling the sorcerers.&quot;

==Socialist background==
It was long believed that the socialist Constant disappeared with the demise of the Second Republic and gave way to the occultist Éliphas Lévi. However, according to historian of religions Julian Strube, who wrote his doctoral dissertation on Constant, this narrative was constructed at the end of the 19th century in occultist circles and was uncritically adopted by later scholars. Strube argues that Constant not only developed his occultism as a direct consequence of his socialist and post-clergical ideas, but he continued to propagate the realization of socialism throughout his entire life.

According to the occultist Papus (Gérard Encausse) and the occultist biographer Paul Chacornac, Constant&#x27;s turn to occultism was the result of an &quot;initiation&quot; by the eccentric Polish expatriate Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński. The two did know each other, as evidenced in Constant&#x27;s 6 January 1853 letter to Hoene-Wroński, thanking him for including one of Constant&#x27;s articles in Hoené-Wroński&#x27;s 1852 work, &quot;Historiosophie ou science de l&#x27;histoire&quot;. In the letter Constant expresses his admiration for Hoené-Wroński&#x27;s &quot;still underappreciated genius&quot; and calls himself his &quot;sincere admirer and devoted disciple.&quot; Nonetheless, Strube argues that Wronski&#x27;s influence had been brief, between 1852 and 1853, and superficial. He criticizes Papus and his companions&#x27; research based on Papus&#x27; attempts to contact Constant on 11 January 1886—11 years after Constant&#x27;s death.

Later on, the construction of a specifically French esoteric tradition, in which Constant was to form a crucial link, perpetuated this idea of a clear rupture between the socialist Constant and the occultist Lévi. Strube in 2016 wrote that a different narrative was developed independently by Arthur Edward Waite, who was a near contemporary of Lévi. Strube opined that A. E. Waite knew insufficient details of Constant&#x27;s life.

Furthermore, Strube proposes that Lévi contemplated &quot;magic&quot; as a &quot;new order&quot;—an ideology (potentially a politically useful superstition) by which a new hierarchy would be articulated, as he interpret from Levi&#x27;s statement: &quot;Hereunto therefore we have made it plain, as we believe, that our Magic is opposed to the goetic and necromantic kinds. It is at once an absolute science and religion, which should not indeed destroy and absorb all opinions and all forms of worship, but should regenerate and direct them by reconstituting the circle of initiates, and thus providing the blind masses with wise and clear-seeing leaders.&quot; Strube argues that &quot;A journey to London that Lévi made in May 1854, did not cause his preoccupation with magic&quot;, and that &quot;even though Lévi professed involvement in magical ritual. Instead, it was the aforementioned socialist-magnetistic dialectic that compassed Lévi&#x27;s interest in magic.&quot; Despite so, it is clear that Lévi&#x27;s statement limits itself to magic and its kinds, where Lévi proposes to have merged science and religion and promotes his own methods by claiming to have applied a scientific approach in his research, contrasting it against the Goetic and Necromantic methods.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Gotter (3 September 1746 – 18 March 1797) was a German poet, dramatist, and opera librettist.

==Biography==
He was born at Gotha. He started out studying law, but early on was influenced to write for the theatre. After the completion of his university course at Göttingen, he was appointed second director of the Gotha Archive. He subsequently went to Wetzlar, the seat of the imperial law courts, as secretary to the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha legation. In 1768 he returned to Gotha as tutor to two young noblemen, and here, together with H. C. Boie, he founded the famous &quot;Göttinger Musenalmanach&quot;. In 1770 he was once more in Wetzlar, where he belonged to Goethe&#x27;s circle. Four years later he returned to live permanently in Gotha, where he worked until his death.

==Work==
Gotter was the chief representative of French taste in the German literary life of his time. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, his poetry is elegant and polished, and largely free from the trivialities of the Anacreontic lyric of the earlier generation of imitators of French literature; but he lacked imaginative depth.

In 1772 Gotter wrote his first libretto for the comic opera &quot;Die Dorfgala&quot; with music by composer Anton Schweitzer. He followed this with a second operatic farce, &quot;Der Jahrmarkt&quot; (1775), with music by Georg Benda. His plays, of which &quot;Merope&quot; (1774), an adaptation in blank verse of the tragedies of Maffei and Voltaire, and &quot;Medea&quot; (1775), a melodrama, are best known, were mostly based on French originals and had considerable influence in counteracting the formlessness and irregularity of the Sturm und Drang drama.&quot;Medea&quot; also served as a libretto for another opera by Benda (1778). Gotter also wrote the libretti to five more operas by Benda: &quot;Walder&quot; (1776), &quot;Romeo und Julie&quot; (1776), &quot;Der Holzhauer oder Die drey Wünsche&quot; (1778), &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1779), and &quot;Das tartarische Gesetz&quot; (1787). He also wrote the libretto to Johann Rudolf Zumsteeg&#x27;s &quot;Das tartarische Gesetz&quot; (1780) which was based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. 

Gotter&#x27;s collected &quot;Gedichte&quot; appeared in 2 vols. in 1787 and 1788; a third volume (1802) contains his &quot;Literarischer Nachlass&quot;. See B. Litzmann, &quot;Schröder und Gotter&quot; (1887), and R. Schlösser, &quot;F. W. Gotter, sein Leben und seine Werke&quot; (1894).

His best known work is the lyrics to the well known lullaby &quot;Schlafe, mein Prinzchen, Schlaf ein&quot;.

<doc id="200405" wikidata="Q192560" url="?curid=200405" title="Limbic system">
<text>The limbic system, also known as the paleomammalian cortex, is a set of brain structures located on both sides of the thalamus, immediately beneath the medial temporal lobe of the cerebrum primarily in the forebrain.

Its various components support a variety of functions including emotion, behavior, long-term memory, and olfaction.

The limbic system is involved in lower order emotional processing of input from sensory systems and consists of the amygdala, mammillary bodies, stria medullaris, central gray and dorsal and ventral nuclei of Gudden. This processed information is often relayed to a collection of structures from the telencephalon, diencephalon, and mesencephalon, including the prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, limbic thalamus, hippocampus including the parahippocampal gyrus and subiculum, nucleus accumbens (limbic striatum), anterior hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, midbrain raphe nuclei, habenular commissure, entorhinal cortex, and olfactory bulbs.

==Structure==
The limbic lobe was originally defined by Paul Broca in 1878, as a series of cortical structures surrounding the boundary between the cerebral hemispheres and the brainstem. The name &quot;limbic&quot; comes from the Latin word for the border, &quot;limbus&quot;. Further studies began to associate these areas with emotional and motivational processes and linked them to subcortical components that were then grouped into the limbic system.

In recent years, multiple additional limbic fiber connectivity has been revealed using diffusion-weighted MRI. The equivalent fiber connectivity of all these pathways has been documented by dissection studies in primates. Some of these fiber tracts include the amygdalofugal tract, amygdalothalamic tract, stria terminalis, dorsal thalamo-hypothalamic tract, cerebellohypothalamic tracts, and the parieto-occipito-hypothalamic tract.

Currently, it is not considered an isolated entity responsible for the neurological regulation of emotion, but rather one of the many parts of the brain that regulate visceral autonomic processes. Therefore, the set of anatomical structures considered part of the limbic system is controversial. The following structures are, or have been considered, part of the limbic system:

*Cortical areas:
**Limbic lobe
**Orbitofrontal cortex: a region in the frontal lobe involved in the process of decision-making
**Piriform cortex: part of the olfactory system
**Entorhinal cortex: related to memory and associative components
**Fornix: a white matter structure connecting the hippocampus with other brain structures, particularly the mammillary bodies and septal nuclei
*Subcortical areas:
**Septal nuclei: a set of structures that lie in front of the lamina terminalis, considered a pleasure zone
**Hippocampus and associated structures: play a central role in the consolidation of new memories
**Amygdala: located deep within the temporal lobes and related with a number of emotional processes
**Nucleus accumbens: involved in reward, pleasure, and addiction
*Diencephalic structures:
**Hypothalamus: a center for the limbic system, connected with the frontal lobes, septal nuclei, and the brain stem reticular formation via the medial forebrain bundle, with the hippocampus via the fornix, and with the thalamus via the mammillothalamic fasciculus; regulates many autonomic processes
**Mammillary bodies: part of the hypothalamus that receives signals from the hippocampus via the fornix and projects them to the thalamus
**Anterior nuclei of thalamus: receive input from the mammillary bodies and involved in memory processing

== Function ==
The structures and interacting areas of the limbic system are involved in motivation, emotion, learning, and memory. The limbic system is where the subcortical structures meet the cerebral cortex. The limbic system operates by influencing the endocrine system and the autonomic nervous system. It is highly interconnected with the nucleus accumbens, which plays a role in sexual arousal and the &quot;high&quot; derived from certain recreational drugs. These responses are heavily modulated by dopaminergic projections from the limbic system. In 1954, Olds and Milner found that rats with metal electrodes implanted into their nucleus accumbens, as well as their septal nuclei, repeatedly pressed a lever activating this region.

The limbic system also interacts with the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are a set of subcortical structures that direct intentional movements. The basal ganglia are located near the thalamus and hypothalamus. They receive input from the cerebral cortex, which sends outputs to the motor centers in the brain stem. A part of the basal ganglia called the striatum controls posture and movement. Recent studies indicate that if there is an inadequate supply of dopamine in the striatum, this can lead to the symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

The limbic system is also tightly connected to the prefrontal cortex. Some scientists contend that this connection is related to the pleasure obtained from solving problems. To cure severe emotional disorders, this connection was sometimes surgically severed, a procedure of psychosurgery, called a prefrontal lobotomy (this is actually a misnomer). Patients having undergone this procedure often became passive and lacked all motivation.

The limbic system interacts heavily with the cerebral cortex. These interactions are closely linked to olfaction, emotions, drives, autonomic regulation, memory, and pathologically to encephalopathy, epilepsy, psychotic symptoms, cognitive defects. The functional relevance of the limbic system has proven to serve many different functions such as affects/emotions, memory, sensory processing, time perception, attention, consciousness, instincts, autonomic/vegetative control, and actions/motor behavior. Some of the disorders associated with the limbic system and its interacting components are epilepsy and schizophrenia.

===Hippocampus===

The hippocampus is involved with various processes relating to cognition and is one of the best understood and heavily involved limbic interacting structures.

====Spatial memory====
The first and most widely researched area concerns memory, particularly spatial memory. Spatial memory was found to have many sub-regions in the hippocampus, such as the dentate gyrus (DG) in the dorsal hippocampus, the left hippocampus, and the parahippocampal region. The dorsal hippocampus was found to be an important component for the generation of new neurons, called adult-born granules (GC), in adolescence and adulthood. These new neurons contribute to pattern separation in spatial memory, increasing the firing in cell networks, and overall causing stronger memory formations. This is thought to integrate spatial and episodic memories with the limbic system via a feedback loop that provides emotional context of a particular sensory input.

While the dorsal hippocampus is involved in spatial memory formation, the left hippocampus is a participant in the recall of these spatial memories. Eichenbaum and his team found, when studying the hippocampal lesions in rats, that the left hippocampus is &quot;critical for effectively combining the &#x27;what&#x27;, &#x27;when&#x27;, and &#x27;where&#x27; qualities of each experience to compose the retrieved memory&quot;. This makes the left hippocampus a key component in the retrieval of spatial memory. However, Spreng found that the left hippocampus is a general concentrated region for binding together bits and pieces of memory composed not only by the hippocampus, but also by other areas of the brain to be recalled at a later time. Eichenbaum&#x27;s research in 2007 also demonstrates that the parahippocampal area of the hippocampus is another specialized region for the retrieval of memories just like the left hippocampus.

====Learning====
The hippocampus, over the decades, has also been found to have a huge impact in learning. Curlik and Shors examined the effects of neurogenesis in the hippocampus and its effects on learning. This researcher and his team employed many different types of mental and physical training on their subjects, and found that the hippocampus is highly responsive to these latter tasks. Thus, they discovered an upsurge of new neurons and neural circuits in the hippocampus as a result of the training, causing an overall improvement in the learning of the task. This neurogenesis contributes to the creation of adult-born granules cells (GC), cells also described by Eichenbaum in his own research on neurogenesis and its contributions to learning. The creation of these cells exhibited &quot;enhanced excitability&quot; in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the dorsal hippocampus, impacting the hippocampus and its contribution to the learning process.

====Hippocampus damage====
Damage related to the hippocampal region of the brain has reported vast effects on overall cognitive functioning, particularly memory such as spatial memory. As previously mentioned, spatial memory is a cognitive function greatly intertwined with the hippocampus. While damage to the hippocampus may be a result of a brain injury or other injuries of that sort, researchers particularly investigated the effects that high emotional arousal and certain types of drugs had on the recall ability in this specific memory type. In particular, in a study performed by Parkard, rats were given the task of correctly making their way through a maze. In the first condition, rats were stressed by shock or restraint which caused a high emotional arousal. When completing the maze task, these rats had an impaired effect on their hippocampal-dependent memory when compared to the control group. Then, in a second condition, a group of rats were injected with anxiogenic drugs. Like the former these results reported similar outcomes, in that hippocampal-memory was also impaired. Studies such as these reinforce the impact that the hippocampus has on memory processing, in particular the recall function of spatial memory. Furthermore, impairment to the hippocampus can occur from prolonged exposure to stress hormones such as glucocorticoids (GCs), which target the hippocampus and cause disruption in explicit memory.

In an attempt to curtail life-threatening epileptic seizures, 27-year-old Henry Gustav Molaison underwent bilateral removal of almost all of his hippocampus in 1953. Over the course of fifty years he participated in thousands of tests and research projects that provided specific information on exactly what he had lost. Semantic and episodic events faded within minutes, having never reached his long-term memory, yet emotions, unconnected from the details of causation, were often retained. Dr. Suzanne Corkin, who worked with him for 46 years until his death, described the contribution of this tragic &quot;experiment&quot; in her 2013 book.

===Amygdala===
====Episodic-autobiographical memory (EAM) networks====
Another integrative part of the limbic system, the amygdala, which is the deepest part of the limbic system, is involved in many cognitive processes and is largely considered the most primordial and vital part of the limbic system. Like the hippocampus, processes in the amygdala seem to impact memory; however, it is not spatial memory as in the hippocampus but the semantic division of episodic-autobiographical memory (EAM) networks. Markowitsch&#x27;s amygdala research shows it encodes, stores, and retrieves EAM memories. To delve deeper into these types of processes by the amygdala, Markowitsch and his team provided extensive evidence through investigations that the &quot;amygdala&#x27;s main function is to charge cues so that mnemonic events of a specific emotional significance can be successfully searched within the appropriate neural nets and re-activated.&quot; These cues for emotional events created by the amygdala encompass the EAM networks previously mentioned.

====Attentional and emotional processes====
Besides memory, the amygdala also seems to be an important brain region involved in attentional and emotional processes. First, to define attention in cognitive terms, attention is the ability to focus on some stimuli while ignoring others. Thus, the amygdala seems to be an important structure in this ability.

Foremost, however, this structure was historically thought to be linked to fear, allowing the individual to take action in response to that fear. However, as time has gone by, researchers such as Pessoa, generalized this concept with help from evidence of EEG recordings, and concluded that the amygdala helps an organism to define a stimulus and therefore respond accordingly. However, when the amygdala was initially thought to be linked to fear, this gave way for research in the amygdala for emotional processes. Kheirbek demonstrated research that the amygdala is involved in emotional processes, in particular the ventral hippocampus. He described the ventral hippocampus as having a role in neurogenesis and the creation of adult-born granule cells (GC). These cells not only were a crucial part of neurogenesis and the strengthening of spatial memory and learning in the hippocampus but also appear to be an essential component to the function of the amygdala. A deficit of these cells, as Pessoa (2009) predicted in his studies, would result in low emotional functioning, leading to high retention rate of mental diseases, such as anxiety disorders.

====Social processing====
Social processing, specifically the evaluation of faces in social processing, is an area of cognition specific to the amygdala. In a study done by Todorov, fMRI tasks were performed with participants to evaluate whether the amygdala was involved in the general evaluation of faces. After the study, Todorov concluded from his fMRI results that the amygdala did indeed play a key role in the general evaluation of faces. However, in a study performed by researchers Koscik and his team, the trait of trustworthiness was particularly examined in the evaluation of faces. Koscik and his team demonstrated that the amygdala was involved in evaluating the trustworthiness of an individual. They investigated how brain damage to the amygdala played a role in trustworthiness, and found that individuals with damaged amygdalas tended to confuse trust and betrayal, and thus placed trust in those having done them wrong. Furthermore, Rule, along with his colleagues, expanded on the idea of the amygdala in its critique of trustworthiness in others by performing a study in 2009 in which he examined the amygdala&#x27;s role in evaluating general first impressions and relating them to real-world outcomes. Their study involved first impressions of CEOs. Rule demonstrated that while the amygdala did play a role in the evaluation of trustworthiness, as observed by Koscik in his own research two years later in 2011, the amygdala also played a generalized role in the overall evaluation of first impression of faces. This latter conclusion, along with Todorov&#x27;s study on the amygdala&#x27;s role in general evaluations of faces and Koscik&#x27;s research on trustworthiness and the amygdala, further solidified evidence that the amygdala plays a role in overall social processing.

====Klüver–Bucy syndrome====

Based on experiments done on monkeys, the destruction of the temporal cortex almost always led to damage of the amygdala. This damage done to the amygdala led the physiologists Kluver and Bucy to pinpoint major changes in the behavior of the monkeys. The monkeys demonstrated the following changes:

# The monkeys would no longer exhibit responses of fear or anger. 
# The monkeys would inspect and physically touch all objects placed in front of them.
# The monkeys forgot rapidly.
# The monkeys had a tendency to orally examine objects (e.g. biting, licking, etc.).
# The monkeys would respond, as if required to, to every stimulus (i.e. Hypermetamorphosis (psychology)).
# The monkeys exhibited hypersexuality, demonstrating a sexual drive so strong that they would continuously stimulate their genitalia, copulate repeatedly and for long periods of time, and sometimes sustain small injuries in the process (e.g. due to excessive biting).

This set of behavioral change came to be known as the Klüver–Bucy syndrome.

== Evolutionary claims ==
Paul D. MacLean, as part of his triune brain theory (which is now considered outdated ), hypothesized that the limbic system is older than other parts of the forebrain, and that it developed to manage circuitry attributed to the fight or flight first identified by Hans Selye in his report of the General Adaptation Syndrome in 1936. It may be considered a part of survival adaptation in reptiles as well as mammals (including humans). MacLean postulated that the human brain has evolved three components, that evolved successively, with more recent components developing at the top/front. These components are, respectively:
# The archipallium or primitive (&quot;reptilian&quot;) brain, comprising the structures of the brain stem – medulla, pons, cerebellum, mesencephalon, the oldest basal nuclei – the globus pallidus and the olfactory bulbs.
# The paleopallium or intermediate (&quot;old mammalian&quot;) brain, comprising the structures of the limbic system.
# The neopallium, also known as the superior or rational (&quot;new mammalian&quot;) brain, comprises almost the whole of the hemispheres (made up of a more recent type of cortex, called neocortex) and some subcortical neuronal groups. It corresponds to the brain of the superior mammals, thus including the primates and, as a consequence, the human species. Similar development of the neocortex in mammalian species not closely related to humans and primates has also occurred, for example in cetaceans and elephants; thus the designation of &quot;superior mammals&quot; is not an evolutionary one, as it has occurred independently in different species. The evolution of higher degrees of intelligence is an example of convergent evolution, and is also seen in non-mammals such as birds.

According to Maclean, each of the components, although connected with the others, retained &quot;their peculiar types of intelligence, subjectivity, sense of time and space, memory, mobility and other less specific functions&quot;.

However, while the categorization into structures is reasonable, the recent studies of the limbic system of tetrapods, both living and extinct, have challenged several aspects of this hypothesis, notably the accuracy of the terms &quot;reptilian&quot; and &quot;old mammalian&quot;. The common ancestors of reptiles and mammals had a well-developed limbic system in which the basic subdivisions and connections of the amygdalar nuclei were established. Further, birds, which evolved from the dinosaurs, which in turn evolved separately but around the same time as the mammals, have a well-developed limbic system. While the anatomic structures of the limbic system are different in birds and mammals, there are functional equivalents.

==History ==

=== Etymology and history===
The term &quot;limbic&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;&quot;, for &quot;border&quot; or &quot;edge&quot;, or, particularly in medical terminology, a border of an anatomical component. Paul Broca coined the term based on its physical location in the brain, sandwiched between two functionally different components.

The limbic system is a term that was introduced in 1949 by the American physician and neuroscientist, Paul D. MacLean. The French physician Paul Broca first called this part of the brain in 1878. He examined the differentiation between deeply recessed cortical tissue and underlying, subcortical nuclei. However, most of its putative role in emotion was developed only in 1937 when the American physician James Papez described his anatomical model of emotion, the Papez circuit.

The first evidence that the limbic system was responsible for the cortical representation of emotions was discovered in 1939, by Heinrich Kluver and Paul Bucy. Kluver and Bucy, after much research, demonstrated that the bilateral removal of the temporal lobes in monkeys created an extreme behavioral syndrome. After performing a temporal lobectomy, the monkeys showed a decrease in aggression. The animals revealed a reduced threshold to visual stimuli, and were thus unable to recognize objects that were once familiar. MacLean expanded these ideas to include additional structures in a more dispersed &quot;limbic system&quot;, more on the lines of the system described above. MacLean developed the theory of the &quot;triune brain&quot; to explain its evolution and to try to reconcile rational human behavior with its more &quot;primal&quot; and &quot;violent&quot; side. He became interested in the brain&#x27;s control of emotion and behavior. After initial studies of brain activity in epileptic patients, he turned to cats, monkeys, and other models, using electrodes to stimulate different parts of the brain in conscious animals recording their responses.

In the 1950s, he began to trace individual behaviors like aggression and sexual arousal to their physiological sources. He postulated the limbic system as the brain&#x27;s center of emotions, including the hippocampus and amygdala. Developing observations made by Papez, he hypothesized that the limbic system had evolved in early mammals to control fight-or-flight responses and react to both emotionally pleasurable and painful sensations. The concept is now broadly accepted in neuroscience. Additionally, MacLean said that the idea of the limbic system leads to a recognition that its presence &quot;represents the history of the evolution of mammals and their distinctive family way of life.&quot;

In the 1960s, Dr. MacLean enlarged his theory to address the human brain&#x27;s overall structure and divided its evolution into three parts, an idea that he termed the triune brain. In addition to identifying the limbic system, he hypothesized a supposedly more primitive brain called the R-complex, related to reptiles, which controls basic functions like muscle movement and breathing. According to him, the third part, the neocortex, controls speech and reasoning and is the most recent evolutionary arrival. The concept of the limbic system has since been further expanded and developed by Walle Nauta, Lennart Heimer, and others.

=== Academic dispute ===
There is controversy over the use of the term &quot;limbic system&quot;, with scientists such as Joseph E. LeDoux and Edmund Rolls arguing that the term be considered obsolete and abandoned. Originally, the limbic system was believed to be the emotional center of the brain, with cognition being the business of the neocortex. However, cognition depends on acquisition and retention of memories, in which the hippocampus, a primary limbic interacting structure, is involved: hippocampus damage causes severe cognitive (memory) deficits. More important, the &quot;boundaries&quot; of the limbic system have been repeatedly redefined because of advances in neuroscience. Therefore, while it is true that limbic interacting structures are more closely related to emotion, the limbic system itself is best thought of as a component of a larger emotional processing plant.

<doc id="200406" wikidata="Q1587432" url="?curid=200406" title="Francesco Scipione Maffei">
<text>Francesco Scipione Maffei (; 1 June 1675 – 11 February 1755) was an Italian writer and art critic, author of many articles and plays. An antiquarian with a humanist education whose publications on Etruscan antiquities stand as incunables of Etruscology, he engaged in running skirmishes in print with his rival in the field of antiquities, Antonio Francesco Gori.

==Early career==
Maffei was of the illustrious family that originated in Bologna; his brother was General Alessandro Maffei, whose memoirs he edited and published. He studied for five years in Parma, at the Jesuit College, and afterwards, from 1698, at Rome, where he became a member of the Accademia degli Arcadi; on his return to Verona he established a local &quot;Arcadia&quot;.

In 1703, he volunteered to fight for Bavaria in the War of Spanish Succession, and saw action in 1704 at the Battle of Schellenberg, near Donauwörth. His brother, Alessandro, was second in command at the battle.

In 1709, he went to Padua, where he briefly collaborated with Apostolo Zeno and Antonio Valisnieri in editing the ambitious literary periodical the &quot;Giornale de&#x27; Letterati d&#x27;Italia&quot;, which had but a short career.

==Theatre projects==
Subsequently, an acquaintance with the actor Riccoboni led him to exert himself for the improvement of dramatic art in Italy and a revitalized Italian theatre. His masterpiece, the tragedy &quot;Merope&quot;, 1714, brought him popularity in Europe; it was famed for its rapid action and the elimination of the prologue and chorus. Other works for the theatre include &quot;Teatro Italiano&quot;, a small collection of works for presentation on the stage, in 1723–1725; and &quot;Le Ceremonie&quot;, an original comedy, in 1728. A complete edition of his works appeared at Venice (28 vols. 8vo in 1790).

==His collections and antiquarian publications==

In 1710, he spent some time studying the manuscripts in the Royal Library at Turin; while there he arranged the collection of objects of art which the late Carlo Emanuele, Duke of Savoy had brought from Rome. From 1718 he became especially interested in the archaeology of his native town, and his investigations resulted in the valuable &quot;Verona illustrata&quot; (1731–1732).

Maffei devoted the years 1732–1736 to travel in France, England, the Netherlands and Germany. In 1732 he went to the south of France for purposes of archaeological research and from there he went to Paris, where he remained four years and was received as member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres. On a visit to London in 1736, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and received at Oxford University, where he was honoured with a doctoral degree; he returned through Holland and Germany to Verona. He was a friend of Francesco Algarotti, who wrote him many letters.

On his return to Verona, he built a museum, which he bequeathed, together with his valuable archaeological and artistic collection, to his native city. He bequeathed his collection of manuscripts to the canons of the cathedral of Verona. In later life he became interested in astronomy and physics, and built an observatory to study the stars.

==Philosophical treatises==
Upon returning from his journey in 1736, Maffei wrote the &quot;Consiglio politico&quot; addressed to the Venetian government. In the treatise, Maffei questioned the structure of Venice&#x27;s aristocratic government, and suggested the opening of public offices to the elites of the Venetian mainland domains. Ultimately, the &quot;Consiglio politico&quot; advocated introducing into the government of the Republic of Venice elements of political representation, which Maffei had identified in his antiquarian studies of the Roman constitution, and later observed in foreign lands during his European travels.
Maffei did not actually present his &quot;Consiglio politico&quot; to the Venetian government. The treatise was only published posthumously, shortly before the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797. It circulated during the Risorgimento, and might have influenced Carlo Cattaneo&#x27;s federalist ideas.

The Jesuits requested Maffei to write in defence of the orthodox system of grace against the doctrine of the Jansenists, which resulted in his &quot;Istoria teologica delle doctrine e delle opinione corse ne cinque primo secoli della chiesa in proposito della divina grazia, del libero arbitrio e della predestinazione&quot;, published at Trent, 1742.

He also published a letter and a book arguing against the existence of supernatural magic and witches, that mixes both enlightenment thinking and theologic arguments based on scripture.
 This letter on magic was subsequently printed in Augustin Calmet&#x27;s dissertation on magic and vampires titled Traité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, &amp;c. (1751).

==Posthumous reputation==
The secondary school &#x27;Liceo Maffei&#x27; in Verona is named in his honour.

He is also known for having written a description of Bartolomeo Cristofori&#x27;s invention of a hammer mechanism for the harpsichord, work widely considered to comprise the invention of the piano. Maffei published the article in the &quot;Giornale de&#x27; Letterati d’Italia&quot; in 1711. Maffei was one of the editors of the Giornale. Maffei reprinted the article in his &quot;Rime e Prose&quot;, a collection of some of his writings, published in Venice in 1719.

The Italian poet and translator Ippolito Pindemonte published a biographical elegy on his friend.

<doc id="200407" wikidata="Q213737" url="?curid=200407" title="Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg-Stolberg">
<text>Friedrich Leopold Graf zu Stolberg-Stolberg (7 November 1750 – 5 December 1819), was a German lawyer, and translator born at Bramstedt in Holstein (then a part of Denmark). He was also a poet of the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; and early Romantic periods.

==Life==
Friedrich Leopold belonged to a cadet branch of the Stolberg family. He was born the son of a Danish magistrate and owner of a manorial estate, Count Christian zu Stolberg. A few years after his birth the family moved to Copenhagen and soon formed friendships with distinguished literary men, especially Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, who became a mentor to the brothers after the death of their father in 1765.

Together with his elder brother Christian, Friedrich Leopold went to the University of Halle in 1770, in order to study German Law. His other studies embraced the Classics and various historical courses. The two brothers then studied in Göttingen and were a prominent members of the Göttinger Hainbund, a literary society of young men who had high aspirations for the unity of the country, and who cultivated German poetry. After leaving the university, in 1775 the brothers made a journey to Switzerland in company with the famed poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
In 1777 Friedrich Leopold was appointed envoy of the prince bishop of Lübeck at the Court of Copenhagen, but often stayed at Eutin to spend time with his college friend and member of the Dichterbund, Johann Heinrich Voss. In 1781, he was chief administrator at Eutin.

In 1782 Stolberg married Agnes von Witzleben, whom he celebrated in his poems. After six years of happy married life, leaving two sons and two daughters (one of them, Marie Agnes, married Ferdinand, son of Christian Frederick of Stolberg-Wernigerode), Agnes died an early death in 1788. 

Friedrich Leopold then became Danish envoy to the Court of Prussia, and contracted a second marriage with the Countess Sophie von Redern in 1789. After their wedding he and his wife took a grand tour through Germany, Switzerland, and Italy; he documented this trip in a series of letters, &quot;Travels through Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Sicily.&quot;

This tour was of great importance for his religious development, as he then made the acquaintance of the devout Catholic Freiherr von Droste-Vischering, as well as of Droste-Vischering&#x27;s resident tutor, the distinguished theologian Katerkamp. In 1791 he was appointed president of the Lübeck episcopal court at Eutin. In June, 1800, he joined the Catholic Church in the private chapel of the Princess Gallitzin at Osnabrück, and on 22 August he resigned his various positions, retiring to Münster in Westphalia. He was active in a group of Westphalian Catholics working to develop Romanticism.

By his second marriage Stolberg had a large family, of which all, with the exception of the oldest daughter, followed their father&#x27;s example and joined the Catholic Church in 1801. The oldest daughter, Agnes, was betrothed to the Lutheran Count Ferdinand of Stolberg-Wernigerode. Four sons and two sons-in-law took part in the campaign against France in 1814; one of these sons was killed at the Battle of Ligny (1815).

For his conversion to Catholicism, Friedrich Leopold was severely attacked by his former friend Voss (&quot;Wie ward Fritz Stolberg zum Unfreien?&quot;, 1819). After living for a while (from 1812) in the neighbourhood of Bielefeld, he removed to his estate of Schloss Sondermühlen (now part of Melle) near Osnabrück, where he remained until his death in 1819.

==Works==
In his student days, Stolberg was a member of the &quot;Göttinger Hainbund&quot;, part of the Sturm und Drang movement. &quot;Friedrich’s verse also has a pastoral, idyllic quality that ties his work to the Romantics.&quot;

Friedrich Leopold wrote many odes, ballads, satires and dramas; among them the tragedy &quot;Timoleon&quot; (1784). He produced translations of the &quot;Iliad&quot; (1778), of &quot;Plato&quot; (1796-1797), &quot;Aeschylus&quot; (1802), and &quot;Ossian&quot; (1806); he published in 1815 a &quot;Leben Alfreds des Grossen&quot;, and a voluminous &quot;Geschichte der Religion Jesu Christi&quot; (17 vols., 1806–1818). Other works include poetry, as &quot;Ballads&quot; (1779) and &quot;Iambics&quot; (1784), and other works, such as &quot;Plays&quot; (1787) and &quot;Travels&quot; (1791); and novels, such as &quot;The Island&quot; (1788). He also wrote a history of &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; (1816); a life of &quot;St. Vincent de Paul&quot;; translated passages from the works of St. Augustine, and also wrote meditations on the Holy Scriptures, which, however, together with the &quot;Büchlein der Liebe&quot;, and the polemical pamphlet &quot;Kurze Abfertigung des langen Schmähschrifts des Hofrats Voss&quot;, did not appear until after his death.

Several of his poems were set to music by the Austrian composer Franz Schubert.

== Bibliography==
The &quot;Collected Works of Christian and Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg&quot; were published in twenty volumes in 1820–1825; 2nd ed. 1827. Friedrich&#x27;s correspondence with FH Jacobi will be found in Jacobi&#x27;s &quot;Briefwechsel&quot; (1825-1827); that with Voss was edited by Otto Hellinghaus (1891).

Selections from the poetry of the two brothers will be found in August Sauer&#x27;s &quot;Der Göttinger Dichterbund&quot;, iii. (Kürschner&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche Nationalliteratur&quot;, vol. 50, 1896). See also:

<doc id="200414" wikidata="Q2263983" url="?curid=200414" title="Boston Pops">
<text>The Boston Pops is an American orchestra based in Boston, Massachusetts, specializing in light classical and popular music. The orchestra&#x27;s current music director is Keith Lockhart.

Founded in 1885 as an offshoot of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO), the Boston Pops primarily consists of musicians from the BSO, although generally not all of the first-chair players. The orchestra performs a spring season of popular music and a holiday program in December. For the Pops, the seating on the floor of Symphony Hall is reconfigured from auditorium seating to banquet and cafe seating. The Pops also plays an annual concert at the Hatch Memorial Shell on the Esplanade every Fourth of July. Their performances of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;1812 Overture&quot; and Sousa&#x27;s &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; are famous for howitzer cannons firing and fireworks exploding during the former and the unfurling of the American flag that occurs near the end of the latter. Identified with its longtime director Arthur Fiedler, the orchestra has recorded extensively, made frequent tours, and appeared often on television.

==History==
In 1881, Henry Lee Higginson, the founder of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, wrote of his wish to present in Boston &quot;concerts of a lighter kind of music&quot;. The Boston Pops Orchestra was founded to present this kind of music to the public, with the first concert performed on July 11, 1885, under the leadership of Adolf Neuendorff. Called the &quot;Promenade Concerts&quot; until 1900, these performances combined light classical music, tunes from the current hits of the musical theater, and an occasional novelty number. Allowing for some changes of taste over the course of a century, the early programs were remarkably similar to the Boston Pops programs of today.

The Boston Pops had seventeen conductors before 1930, when Arthur Fiedler began a fifty-year tenure as the first American-born conductor to lead the orchestra. Under Fiedler&#x27;s direction, the orchestra&#x27;s popularity spread far beyond Boston through recordings, radio and television. Unhappy with the reputation of classical music as being solely for affluent concertgoers, Fiedler made efforts to bring classical music to a wider audience. He instituted a series of free concerts at the Hatch Shell on the Esplanade, a public park beside the Charles River. Fiedler insisted that the Pops Orchestra play popular music as well as well-known classical pieces, opening up a new niche of popular symphonic music. Of the many musical pieces created for the orchestra, the Pops&#x27; most identifiable works were the colorful novelty numbers composed by Fiedler&#x27;s close friend Leroy Anderson, including &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot;, &quot;The Typewriter&quot;, &quot;The Syncopated Clock&quot; and several others. Fiedler also initiated the annual Holiday Pops concerts in December.

Under Fiedler&#x27;s direction, the Boston Pops has sold more commercial recordings than any other orchestra in the world, with total sales of albums, singles, tapes, and cassettes exceeding $50 million. The orchestra&#x27;s first recordings were made in July 1935 for RCA Victor, including the first complete recording of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;. The Pops made their first high-fidelity recording on June 20, 1947, of &quot;Gaîté Parisienne&quot; (based on the music of Jacques Offenbach), and recorded the same music seven years later in stereophonic sound, their first venture in multitrack recording.

Fiedler is also credited with having begun the annual tradition of the Fourth of July Pops concert and fireworks display on the Esplanade, one of the best-attended Independence Day celebrations in the country with estimated crowds of 200,000–500,000 people. Also during Fiedler&#x27;s tenure, the Pops and local public television station WGBH developed a series of weekly televised broadcasts, &quot;Evening at Pops&quot;, recorded during the Pops&#x27; regular season in Symphony Hall.

Some shows have holiday–oriented themes, such as Christmas shows featuring performers such as Jonathan Meath, who appeared as Santa with the Boston Pops for ten shows during 2008–2009.
After Fiedler&#x27;s death in 1979, he was succeeded as conductor of the Boston Pops by the noted film composer John Williams. Williams continued the Pops&#x27; tradition of bringing classical music to a wide audience, initiating the annual &quot;Pops-on-the-Heights&quot; concerts at Boston College and adding his own library of well-known film scores (including &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;) to the orchestra&#x27;s repertoire. During his time with the Pops, Williams performed with Sammy Davis Jr. as one of the artists for one of the Evening at Pops specials that aired in 1988. In 1991, the orchestra played Bill Monroe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Pen&quot; and other bluegrass classics with Ricky Skaggs and the Kentucky Thunder.
In 1992, Williams conducted a memorable performance of the Pops featuring Broadway Icon John Raitt and his daughter Grammy winner Bonnie Raitt along with members of her Band. 

Keith Lockhart assumed the post of principal Pops conductor in 1995. Lockhart continues to conduct the Boston Pops today. Williams is Laureate Conductor of the Pops and conducts the Pops at Symphony Hall and Tanglewood.

==Guest artists==
Lockhart has brought in numerous pop-music acts and icons in addition to Broadway greats (the likes of Idina Menzel, Kristin Chenoweth and Sutton Foster performed with the orchestra throughout Lockhart&#x27;s first 25 years there) to play with the orchestra since being named conductor, including Ben Folds, Rockapella, Guster, My Morning Jacket, Aimee Mann, Kelly Clarkson, and Elvis Costello.

=== Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular (1974–2016) ===
&quot;The Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular&quot; is annually performed by the Boston Pops Esplanade Orchestra on the banks of the Charles River at the Esplanade (sometimes referred to by locals as the &quot;Oval&quot;) of the Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, Massachusetts, every Fourth of July. It was made locally famous in 1974, during which local philanthropist David G. Mugar approached legendary Pops conductor Arthur Fiedler about adding cannons and fireworks during the performance of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s famous &quot;1812 Overture&quot; as well as fireworks and confetti to end John Philip Sousa&#x27;s march &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;. It was a success, and they repeated it in 1975 and 1976, when it was made nationally famous, and even earned a spot in the 1976 Guinness World Records for having the largest audience for a classical concert since the book&#x27;s founding in 1955. It&#x27;s grown since the Bicentennial, and has earned a place in local traditions ever since.

The program was broadcast on WRCB (99.5 FM Boston) on the radio from 1974 to 2016, and Bloomberg Radio from 2017 to present-day (2022), and was presented on television nationally (as &quot;Pops Goes The Fourth&quot;) from 1993, 1995-2002 on A&amp;E Network, 2002-2016 on CBS, and 2017-present-day (2022) on Bloomberg; locally from 1984 and 1987 on WGBH-TV; 1988 as part of the &quot;Evening at Pops&quot; series on PBS; 1993-2001 on WCVB-TV Channel 5; 2002-2016 on WBZ-TV (Channel 4); 2017-present-day (2022) on WHDH (TV) (Channel 7) in Boston and the greater-Boston metro area.

=== Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular (2016–present) ===
In October 2016, the Boston Pops agreed to take over the management of the annual July Fourth fireworks concert on the Esplanade and to take on the responsibility for finding a corporate sponsor for the $2 million cost. On March 7, 2017, it was announced that Eaton Vance and Bloomberg L.P. had been signed on as sponsors of the concert under a three-year deal, and that the telecast of the event would move from WBZ-TV/CBS to Bloomberg Television.

For the 2017 Fireworks Spectacular, Lockhart and the Pops performed with actor Leslie Odom Jr. (of &quot;Hamilton: An American Musical&quot; fame), 1990s pop singer Melissa Etheridge, and pop singer Andy Grammer, in addition to the United States Army Field Band&#x27;s Concert Band and Soldiers&#x27; Chorus.

In its place, the Pops decided to present &quot;A Boston Pops Salute to Our Heroes&quot; on July 4, with the only option for broadcasting it being on television, radio and digital media.

The 2021 Fireworks Spectacular was announced on June 11, 2021. Due to the fact it typically takes 10 weeks to plan, it was decided to split the show into two portions. The musical portion would take place at Tanglewood and broadcast live on-air and internet stream while the fireworks would take place on the Boston Common. The guest artists were Mavis Staples and Jon Batiste (headliners), the Six-String Soldiers of the United States Army Field Band, the Singing Sergeants of the United States Air Force Band.

Also taking the Hatch Shell stage are Broadway star Mandy Gonzalez (“In the Heights”), country duo LoCash, and a trio of Broadway performers — Alton Fitzgerald White, Elizabeth Stanley and Andrea Jones-Sojola — who participated in the Pops’ concert presentation of “Ragtime: The Symphonic Concert.”

=== Holiday Pops (1973–present) ===
Beginning in December 1973, Arthur Fiedler and the Pops started an occasional tradition at Symphony Hall, which after a few years, became a yearly staple of the winter season in Boston—their Christmas concerts, which became known regionally and locally as Holiday Pops.

Once Fiedler died in 1979, John Williams continued the tradition as conductor from 1980 until 1993. After two years of guest conductors while the BSO were interviewing their next permanent conductor, Keith Lockhart led his first Holiday Pops concert in December 1995.

2014 was the year that the Pops began showing popular Christmas movies after their 40- or 42-concert season was over. The first movie chosen was &quot;Home Alone&quot;. The score, written by the laureate conductor Williams, was performed live by the orchestra, accompanying the film. The New Year&#x27;s Eve concert was performed by the Boston Pops Swing Orchestra, led by bandleader Bo Winiker.

2016 was a significant year, because it was the first time in the history of the series of &quot;Holiday Pops&quot; concerts that the Tanglewood Festival Chorus performed without a conductor.

2017 was a significant year, because the BSO had chosen to replace John Oliver as the conductor of the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, and he would begin conducting the chorus that year.

Billed as &quot;Home Alone In Concert&quot;, the score, written by Williams, was once more performed live by the orchestra, accompanying the film. The New Year&#x27;s Eve concert was performed by the Boston Pops Swing Orchestra and special guest Seth MacFarlane.

The Pops introduced a Sensory friendly concert for the first time on Saturday, December 7, 2019. The concert was designed and aimed at all families with children or adults diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder or sensory sensitivities.

=== &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; celebrity guest conductors ===
Over the course of Lockhart&#x27;s quarter-century tenure, there have been numerous celebrity conductors who have joined the orchestra to lead them in Leroy Anderson&#x27;s famous composition. These conductors have included the likes of then-Boston Celtics center Shaquille O&#x27;Neal (2010), then-Massachusetts governor elect Charlie Baker (2014), retired Boston Red Sox second baseman and NESN sportscaster Jerry Remy (2018), and then-Boston Celtics center Tacko Fall (2019), who became the tallest person to ever stand on the Symphony Hall podium.

==POPSearch==
POPSearch is the Boston Pops&#x27; nationwide talent competition that offers amateur singers the chance to perform with the orchestra at Boston&#x27;s Fourth of July Extravaganza, as well as on the orchestra&#x27;s national tour.

<text>The little owl (Athene noctua), also known as the owl of Athena or owl of Minerva, is a bird that inhabits much of the temperate and warmer parts of Europe, the Palearctic east to Korea, and North Africa. It was introduced into Britain at the end of the 19th century and into the South Island of New Zealand in the early 20th century.

This owl is a member of the typical or true owl family Strigidae, which contains most species of owl, the other grouping being the barn owls, Tytonidae. It is a small (approx. 22 cm long), cryptically coloured, mainly nocturnal species and is found in a range of habitats including farmland, woodland fringes, steppes and semi-deserts. It feeds on insects, earthworms, other invertebrates and small vertebrates. Males hold territories which they defend against intruders. This owl is a cavity nester and a clutch of about four eggs is laid in spring. The female does the incubation and the male brings food to the nest, first for the female and later for the newly hatched young. As the chicks grow, both parents hunt and bring them food, and the chicks leave the nest at about seven weeks of age.

Being a common species with a wide range and large total population, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The little owl was formally described in 1769 by the Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli under the binomial name &quot;Strix noctua&quot;. The little owl is now placed in the genus &quot;Athene&quot; that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1822. The owl was designated as the type species of the genus by George Robert Gray in 1841. The genus name, &quot;Athene&quot;, commemorates the Greek goddess Athena (whose name is also at times spelled Athene), as the owl was a symbol of wisdom. The species name &quot;noctua&quot; has, in effect, the same meaning, being the Latin name of an owl sacred to Minerva, Athena&#x27;s Roman counterpart.

The little owl is probably most closely related to the spotted owlet (&quot;Athene brama&quot;). A number of variations occur over the bird&#x27;s wide range and there is some dispute over their taxonomy. The most distinct is the pale grey-brown Middle-Eastern type known as the Syrian little owl (&quot;A. n. lilith&quot;). A 2009 paper in the ornithological journal &quot;Dutch Birding&quot; (vol. 31: 35–37, 2009) has advocated splitting the southeastern races as a separate species, Lilith&#x27;s owl (&quot;Athene glaux&quot;), with subspecies &quot;A. g. glaux&quot;, &quot;A. g. indigena&quot;, and &quot;A. g. lilith&quot;. DNA evidence and vocal patterns support this proposal.

Other forms include another pale race, the north African &quot;A. n. desertae&quot;, and three intermediate subspecies, &quot;A. n. indigena&quot; of southeast Europe and Asia Minor, &quot;A. n. glaux&quot; in north Africa and southwest Asia, and &quot;A. n. bactriana&quot; of central Asia. Differences in size of bird and length of toes, reasons put forward for splitting off &quot;A. n. spilogastra&quot;, seem inconclusive; &quot;A. n. plumipes&quot; has been claimed to differ genetically from other members of the species and further investigation is required. In general, the different varieties both overlap with the ranges of neighbouring groups and intergrade (hybridise) with them across their boundaries.

Thirteen subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;A. n. noctua&quot; (Scopoli, 1769) – central, south, southeast Europe to northwest Russia
* &quot;A. n. bactriana&quot; Blyth, 1847 – Iraq and Azerbaijan to Pakistan and northwest India
* &quot;A. n. glaux&quot; (Savigny, 1809) – coastal north Africa to southwest Israel
* &quot;A. n. impasta&quot; Bangs &amp; Peters, JL, 1928 – west-central China
* &quot;A. n. indigena&quot; Brehm, CL, 1855 – Romania to Greece through Ukraine and Turkey east to south Russia
* &quot;A. n. lilith&quot; Hartert, E, 1913 – Cyprus, south Turkey to Iraq and the Sinai (Egypt)
* &quot;A. n. ludlowi&quot; Baker, ECS, 1926 – Himalayas
* &quot;A. n. orientalis&quot; Severtsov, 1873 – northeast Kazakhstan and northwest China
* &quot;A. n. plumipes&quot; Swinhoe, 1870 – Mongolia, south-central Siberia and northeast China
* &quot;A. n. saharae&quot; (Kleinschmidt, 1909) – Morocco to west Egypt and central Arabia
* &quot;A. n. somaliensis&quot; Reichenow, 1905 – east Ethiopia and Somalia
* &quot;A. n. spilogastra&quot; Heuglin, 1863 – east Sudan, Eritrea and northeast Ethiopia
* &quot;A. n. vidalii&quot; Brehm, AE, 1857 – west Europe

== Description ==
The little owl is a small owl with a flat-topped head, a plump, compact body and a short tail. The facial disc is flattened above the eyes giving the bird a frowning expression. The plumage is greyish-brown, spotted, streaked and barred with white. The underparts are pale and streaked with darker colour. It is usually in length with a wingspan of for both sexes, and weighs about .

The adult little owl of the most widespread form, the nominate &quot;A. n. noctua&quot;, is white-speckled brown above, and brown-streaked white below. It has a large head, long legs, and yellow eyes, and its white &quot;eyebrows&quot; give it a stern expression. Juveniles are duller, and lack the adult&#x27;s white crown spots. This species has a bounding flight like a woodpecker. Moult begins in July and continues to November, with the male starting before the female.

The call is a querulous &quot;kiew, kiew&quot;. Less frequently, various whistling or trilling calls are uttered. In the breeding season, other more modulated calls are made, and a pair may call in duet. Various yelping, chattering or barking sounds are made in the vicinity of the nest.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The little owl is widespread across Europe, Asia and North Africa. Its range in Eurasia extends from the Iberian Peninsula and Denmark eastwards to China and southwards to the Himalayas. In Africa it is present from Mauritania to Egypt, the Red Sea and Arabia. It was introduced to the United Kingdom in the 19th century, and has spread across much of England and the whole of Wales. It was introduced to Otago in New Zealand by the local acclimatisation society in 1906, and to Canterbury a little later, and is now widespread in the eastern and northern South Island; it is partially protected under Schedule 2 of New Zealand&#x27;s Wildlife Act 1953, whereas most introduced birds explicitly have no protection or are game birds.

This is a sedentary species that is found in open countryside in a great range of habitats. These include agricultural land with hedgerows and trees, orchards, woodland verges, parks and gardens, as well as steppes and stony semi-deserts. It is also present in treeless areas such as dunes, and in the vicinity of ruins, quarries and rocky outcrops. It sometimes ventures into villages and suburbs. In the United Kingdom it is chiefly a bird of the lowlands, and usually occurs below . In continental Europe and Asia it may be found at much higher elevations; one individual was recorded from in Tibet.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
This owl usually perches in an elevated position ready to swoop down on any small creature it notices. It feeds on prey such as insects and earthworms, as well as small vertebrates including amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. It may pursue prey on the ground and it caches surplus food in holes or other hiding places. A study of the pellets of indigestible material that the birds regurgitate found mammals formed 20 to 50% of the diet and insects 24 to 49%. Mammals taken included mice, rats, voles, shrews, moles and rabbits. The birds were mostly taken during the breeding season and were often fledglings, and including the chicks of game birds. The insects included Diptera, Dermaptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. Some vegetable matter (up to 5%) was included in the diet and may have been ingested incidentally.

The little owl is territorial, the male normally remaining in one territory for life. However, the boundaries may expand and contract, being largest in the courtship season in spring. The home range, in which the bird actually hunts for food, varies with the type of habitat and time of year. Little owls with home-ranges that incorporate a high diversity of habitats are much smaller (&lt; 2 ha) than those which breed in monotonous farmland (with home-ranges over 12 ha). Larger home-ranges result in increased flight activity, longer foraging trips and fewer nest visits. If a male intrudes into the territory of another, the occupier approaches and emits its territorial calls. If the intruder persists, the occupier flies at him aggressively. If this is unsuccessful, the occupier repeats the attack, this time trying to make contact with his claws. In retreat, an owl often drops to the ground and makes a low-level escape. The territory is more actively defended against a strange male as compared to a known male from a neighbouring territory; it has been shown that the little owl can recognise familiar birds by voice.

The little owl is partly diurnal and often perches boldly and prominently during the day. If living in an area with a large amount of human activity, little owls may grow used to humans and will remain on their perch, often in full view, while people are around. The little owl has a life expectancy of about 16 years. However, many birds do not reach maturity; severe winters can take their toll and some birds are killed by road vehicles at night, so the average lifespan may be on the order of 3 years.

===Breeding===
This owl becomes more vocal at night as the breeding season approaches in late spring. The nesting location varies with habitat, nests being found in holes in trees, in cliffs, quarries, walls, old buildings, river banks and rabbit burrows. A clutch of 3 to 5 eggs is laid (occasionally 2 to 8). The eggs are broadly elliptical, white and without gloss; they measure about . They are incubated by the female who sometimes starts sitting after the first egg is laid. While she is incubating the eggs, the male brings food for her. The eggs hatch after 28 or 29 days. At first the chicks are brooded by the female and the male brings in food which she distributes to them. Later, both parents are involved in hunting and feeding them. The young leave the nest at about 7 weeks, and can fly a week or two later. Usually there is a single brood but when food is abundant, there may be two. The energy reserves that little owl chicks are able to build up when in the nest influences their post-fledgling survival, with birds in good physical condition having a much higher chance of survival than those in poor condition. When the young disperse, they seldom travel more than about . Pairs of birds often remain together all year round and the bond may last until one partner dies.

== Status ==
&quot;A. noctua&quot; has an extremely large range. It has been estimated that there are between 560 thousand and 1.3 million breeding pairs in Europe, and as Europe equates to 25 to 49% of the global range, the world population may be between 5 million and 15 million birds. The population is believed to be stable, and for these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the bird&#x27;s conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

== In human culture ==


Owls have often been depicted from the Upper Palaeolithic onwards, in forms from statuettes and drawings to pottery and wooden posts, but in the main they are generic rather than identifiable to species. The little owl is, however, closely associated with the Greek goddess Athena and the Roman goddess Minerva, and hence represents wisdom and knowledge. A little owl with an olive branch appears on a Greek tetradrachm coin from 500 BC (a copy of which appears on the modern Greek one-euro coin) and in a 5th-century B.C. bronze statue of Athena holding the bird in her hand. The call of a little owl was thought to have heralded the murder of Julius Caesar.

In 1843 several little owls that had been brought from Italy were released by the English naturalist Charles Waterton on his estate at Walton Hall in Yorkshire but these failed to establish themselves. Later successful introductions were made by Lord Lilford on his Lilford Hall estate near Oundle in Northamptonshire and by Edmund Meade-Waldo at Stonewall Park near Edenbridge, Kent. From these areas the birds spread and had become abundant by 1900. The owls acquired a bad reputation and were believed to prey on game bird chicks. They therefore became a concern to game breeders who tried to eliminate them. In 1935 the British Trust for Ornithology initiated a study into the little owl&#x27;s diet led by the naturalist Alice Hibbert-Ware. The report showed that the owls feed almost entirely on insects, other invertebrates and small mammals and thus posed little threat to game birds.

There is evidence that from the 19th century little owls were occasionally kept as ornamental birds. In Italy, tamed and docked little owls were kept to hunt rodents and insects in the house and garden.

More common was keeping little owls to use them in so-called cottage hunting. This took advantage of the fact that many bird species react to owls with aggressive behaviour when they discover them during the day (mobbing). Such huntings, particularly with tawny owls, were practiced in Italy from 350 B.C. until the 20th century and in Germany from the 17th to the 20th century. In Italy, mainly skylarks were caught in this way. The main place of trade was Crespina, a small town near Pisa. Here, little owls were traditionally sold on 29 September, after being taken from their nests and raised in human care. Only since the 1990s has this trade been officially banned; however, because of the long cultural tradition for hunting with little owls, exemptions are still granted. Thus, there is still a breeding center for little owls near Crespina, which is maintained by hunters. 

In 1992, the little owl appeared as a watermark on Jaap Drupsteen’s 100 guilder banknote for the Netherlands.

==Holy sites==
* Karbala is reputed to be the city where Husayn, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, was martyred. Karbala is also the site of two important Shiite mosques, Al Abbass Mosque and Imam Hussain Mosque. Shiites observe a 40-day mourning period for this Imam every spring followed by a pilgrimage to this site. 

* Najaf is the site of Ali ibn Abi Talib&#x27;s tomb known to Shiites as &quot;the wondrous place of martyrdom&quot; and site of one of the world&#x27;s largest and most important Muslim cemeteries. Najaf is also the site of Imam Ali Mosque one of the holiest Shi&#x27;ite mosques.

* Samarra is the site of Shiite Al Askari Mosque.In this Mosque tenth Shia Imam Ali al-Hadi and eleventh Shia Imam Hasan al-Askari are buried. 

*Kadhimiya (north of Baghdad) is regarded as a holy city in Shia Islam. Musa al-Kazim and his grandson, the ninth Shia Imam, Muhammad at-Taqi are both buried there, and their tombs are contained in the Al Kadhimiya Mosque. Shia go on an annual pilgrimage to this shrine in the month of Rajab.

* Great Mosque of Kufa in Kufa, Iraq - contains the tombs of Muslim ibn Aqeel, Khadijah bint Ali, Hani ibn Urwa, and Al-Mukhtar. The mosque also contains many important sites relating to the prophets and Ali, including the place where he was fatally struck on the head while in prostration, &quot;Sujud&quot;.

===Christian===
Assyrian Christians constitute one of the most indigenous communities in the country. Iraq houses some of the most ancient early Christian material culture, including various churches and monasteries in Tikrit, Nineveh, Dohuk, and the Barwari Bala region. These sites include St. Hermiz and St. Matthew monasteries in the town of Alqosh, the churches of Mar Qayoma and St. George in the Assyrian village Dure in Barwar, St. Bnai Shmuni in Aradan, Sapna region, as well as St. Odisho in the village Dere, also in the Sapna region in Northern Iraq.

===Baháʼí Faith===

* Baghdad – The House of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh in Baghdad, is a place of Baháʼí pilgrimage. Its significance is that it is where Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh lived in from 1853 to 1863 (except for two years). It is designated in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas as a place of pilgrimage and is considered a holy place by Baháʼís. During the 1920s the house was confiscated by Shiah authorities, who were hostile to the Baháʼí Faith. The Council of the League of Nations upheld the Baháʼí&#x27;s claim to the house, but it has not yet been returned to the Baháʼí community.

<text>Antoine Isaac, Baron Silvestre de Sacy (; 21 September 175821 February 1838), was a French nobleman, linguist and orientalist. His son, Ustazade Silvestre de Sacy, became a journalist.

==Life and works==

===Early life===
Silvestre de Sacy was born in Paris to a notary named Jacques Abraham Silvestre, a Jansenist. He was born into an ardently Catholic bourgeois family. The surname extension of &quot;de Sacy&quot; was added by the younger son after the name of Louis-Isaac Lemaistre de Sacy, a famous Jansenist cleric who lived in the 17th century. Sacy&#x27;s father died when he was seven years old, and he was educated on his own by his mother.

===Philological studies===

In 1781 he was appointed councillor in the &quot;cour des monnaies&quot;, and was promoted in 1791 to be a commissary-general in the same department. Having successively studied Semitic languages, he began to make a name as an orientalist, and between 1787 and 1791 deciphered the Pahlavi inscriptions of the Sassanid kings. In 1792 he retired from public service, and lived in close seclusion in a cottage near Paris till in 1795 he became the first and only professor of Arabic in the newly founded school of living Eastern languages (École speciale des langues orientales vivantes).

During this interval Sacy studied the religion of the Druze, the subject of his last and unfinished work, the &quot;Exposé de la religion des Druzes&quot; (2 vols., 1838). He published the following Arabic textbooks:
*&quot;Grammaire arabe&quot; (2 vols., 1st ed. 1810)
*&quot;Chrestomathie arabe&quot; (3 vols., 1806)
*&quot;Anthologie grammaticale&quot; (1829)

In 1806 he added the duties of Persian professor to his old chair, and from this time onwards his life was one of increasing honour and success, broken only by a brief period of retreat during the Hundred Days.

===Public offices and memberships===
He was perpetual secretary of the Academy of Inscriptions from 1832 onwards; in 1808 he had entered the &quot;corps législatif&quot;; he was created a baron of the French Empire by Napoleon in 1813; and in 1832, when quite an old man, he became a peer of France and regularly spoke in the Chamber of Peers (&quot;&quot;). In 1815 he became rector of the University of Paris, and after the Second Restoration he was active on the commission of public instruction. With Abel Rémusat, he was joint founder of the Société asiatique, and was inspector of oriental typefaces at the Imprimerie nationale. In 1821 he was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society

==Egyptian hieroglyphics research==
Silvestre de Sacy was the first Frenchman to attempt to read the Rosetta Stone. He made some progress in identifying proper names in the demotic inscription.

From 1807 to 1809, Sacy was also a teacher of Jean-François Champollion, whom he encouraged in his research.

But later on, the relationship between the master and student became chilly. In no small measure, Champollion&#x27;s Napoleonic sympathies were problematic for Sacy, who was decidedly Royalist in his political sympathies.

In 1811, Étienne Marc Quatremère, also a student of Sacy, published his &quot;Mémoires géographiques et historiques sur l&#x27;Égypte… sur quelques contrées voisines&quot;.

There was some rivalry between Champollion and Quatremère. Champollion published a paper in 1814 that covered some of the same territory. The allegations then arose that Champollion had plagiarized the work of Quatremère. Silvestre de Sacy seemed to take the side of Quatremère, according to Champollion.

There was also considerable rivalry between Champollion and Thomas Young, an English Egyptology researcher active in hieroglyphic decipherment. At first they cooperated in their work, but later, from around 1815, a chill arose between them. Again, Sacy took the side of Young.

Young started to correspond with Sacy, who advised Young not to share his work with Champollion and described Champollion as a charlatan. Consequently, Young avoided all direct contact with Champollion.

When Champollion submitted his Coptic grammar and dictionary for publication in 1815, de Sacy also opposed this.

Another student of Sacy was Johan David Åkerblad. He was a Swedish scholar who also contributed significantly to the investigation of the Rosetta Stone. Early on, in 1802, Åkerblad published his version of the Demotic alphabet; sixteen of these letters later proved to be correct and were used by Champollion, as well as by Young. Sacy felt that Akerblad was not getting enough credit for the good work that he was doing.

Thus, the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics was being hampered by political and personal considerations. There were also big political rivalries between England and France at that time that also stood in the way of co-operation.

Nevertheless, when, in spite of all adversity, Champollion had made big progress in decipherment by 1822resulting in his &quot;Lettre à M. Dacier&quot;Sacy cast all politics aside and warmly welcomed the good work of his student.

==Other scholarly works==
Among his other works are his edition of &quot;Hariri&quot; (1822), with a selected Arabic commentary, and of the &quot;Alfiya&quot; (1833), and his &quot;Calila et Dimna&quot; (1816), the Arabic version of the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; which has been in various forms one of the most popular books of the world. Other works include a version of Abd-el-Latif, &quot;Relation arabe sur l&#x27;Egypte&quot;, essays on the history of the law of property in Egypt since the Arab conquest (1805–1818), and &quot;The Book of Wandering Stars&quot;, a translation of a history of the Ottoman Empire and its rule of Egypt, particularly its recounting of the various actions of and events under the Ottoman governors of Egypt. To biblical criticism he contributed a memoir on the Samaritan Arabic &quot;Pentateuch&quot; (&quot;Mém. Acad. des Inscr.&quot; vol. xlix), and editions of the &quot;Arabic and Syriac New Testaments&quot; for the British and Foreign Bible Society. His students include Heinrich Leberecht Fleischer.

== Critical studies ==
Edward Said and other modern scholars have given critical attention to the theoretical foundations of &quot;orientalism&quot; in works like &quot;Chrestomathie arabe.&quot;

==Notable students==
In Edward Said&#x27;s &quot;Orientalism,&quot; Sacy is described as &quot;the teacher of nearly every major Orientalist in Europe, where his students dominated the field for about three-quarters of a century.&quot; Said also notes that several of Sacy&#x27;s students were &quot;politically useful&quot; as part of French presence in Egypt following Napoleon&#x27;s invasion.

<text>The Solonian constitution was created by Solon in the early 6th century BC. At the time of Solon, the Athenian State was almost falling to pieces in consequence of dissensions between the parties into which the population was divided. Solon wanted to revise or abolish the older laws of Draco. He promulgated a code of laws embracing the whole of public and private life, the salutary effects of which lasted long after the end of his constitution.
Under Solon&#x27;s reforms, all debts were abolished and all debt-slaves were freed. The status of the (the &quot;one-sixth workers&quot;), who farmed in an early form of serfdom, was also abolished. These reforms were known as the . Solon&#x27;s constitution reduced the power of the old aristocracy by making wealth rather than birth a criterion for holding political positions, a system called (timocracy). Citizens were also divided based on their land production: , , , and . The lower assembly was given the right to hear appeals, and Solon also created the higher assembly. Both of these were meant to decrease the power of the Areopagus, the aristocratic council. Despite the division between classes and citizens, Solon felt these class were connected as one. Solon felt that a disservice against even just one member of the society would indirectly be a disservice against every member of the society. The only parts of Draconian constitution that Solon kept were the laws regarding homicide. The constitution was written as poetry, and as soon as it was introduced, Solon went into self-imposed exile for ten years so he would not be tempted to take power as a tyrant.

Religion

There was also a religious impact that played a role in the archaic city. Within the clans there was never a recovery of military impact, but religion had always influenced political potential. Generations beyond the years had gone on and religion was not forgotten as the advancement of the political system did.

James H. Oliver. (2003). The Solonian Constitution and a Consul of A.D. 149. &quot;Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies&quot;, &quot;13&quot;(1), page 101.

==Classes==
===Pentacosiomedimnoi===
The or () were the top class of citizens: those whose property or estate could produce at least 500 medimnoi of wet or dry goods (or their equivalent), per year. They were eligible for all top positions of government in Athens. These were:
* Nine archons and treasurers
* Council of Areopagus (as ex-archons)
* Council of 500
* Ecclesia

The could also serve as generals () in the Athenian army.

===Hippeis===

Prior to the rule of Solon, the term &quot;hippeus&quot; came from the word &quot;horse;&quot; those who were rich enough to buy a horse would flaunt their superiority by selecting names that began or ended with the word ‘hippos&#x27;. However, Solon later changed the meaning of the &quot;hippeus,&quot; as it became the second highest of the four social classes. It was composed of men who had at least 300 medimnoi or their equivalent as yearly income. The Hippeus were also called the Knights in Aristotle&#x27;s Athenian Constitution (circa. 350 BC). Aristotle gave an alternate characterization for the class of Hippeus as &#x27;those who were able to maintain a horse&#x27;. This assumption appears to be on the basis of the inscription of the statute of Diphilus

===Zeugitae===
The () were those whose property or estate could produce at least 200 medimnoi of wet or dry goods (or their equivalent), per year. The term appears to have come from the Greek word for &quot;yoke&quot;, which has led modern scholars to conclude that zeugitae were either men who could afford a yoked pair of oxen or men who were &quot;yoked together&quot; in the phalanx—that is, men who could afford their own hoplite armor.

The zeugitae could serve as hoplites in the Athenian army. The idea was that one could serve as a hoplite if he had enough money to equip himself in that manner, i.e. he could produce 200 medimnoi or more per year.

At the time of Solon&#x27;s reforms, zeugitae were granted the right to hold certain minor political offices. Their status rose through the years; in 457/6 BC, they were granted the right to hold the archonship, and in the late 5th century moderate oligarchs advocated for the creation of an oligarchy in which all men of hoplite status or higher would be enfranchised, and such a regime was indeed established for a time during the Athenian coup of 411 BC.

They were eligible for a few positions of government in Athens such as:
* Council of 400
* Lower offices of state
* Ecclesia
* In 457−456 BC, the archonship was opened to zeugitae

===Thetes===

The (, sing. , &#x27;serf&#x27;) were the lowest social class of citizens. The were those who were workers for wages, or had less than 200 medimnoi (or their equivalent) as yearly income. (Thus, the wage ratio of pentacosiomedimni to thetes could be as little as 2.5.) This distinction spanned from some time earlier than 594−593 BC until 322 BC. The were defined as citizens who did not qualify as , although the may have predated the Solonian reforms. They could participate in the Ecclesia (the Athenian assembly), and could be jurors serving in the law court of the Heliaia, but were not allowed to serve in the Boule or serve as magistrates.

In the reforms of Ephialtes and Pericles around 460450 BC, the thetes were empowered to hold public office.

Twelve thousand thetes were disenfranchised and expelled from the city after the Athenian defeat in the Lamian War. There is debate among scholars whether this represented the entire number of thetes, or simply those who left Athens, the remainder staying behind.

Unlike the popular concept of galley slaves, ancient navies generally preferred to rely on free men to row their galleys. In the 4th and 5th century, Athens generally followed a naval policy of enrolling citizens from the lower classes (the thetes), metics and hired foreigners. However, under some conditions, for example during the Mytilenean revolt, higher classes were enrolled as rowers also. This made them crucial in the Athenian Navy and therefore gave them a role in Athens&#x27; affairs.

==Details==

Of the population dissatisfied, the inhabitants of the northern mountainous region of Attica, and the poorest and most oppressed section of the population, the &quot;diacrii&quot;, demanded that the privileges of the nobility, which had till then been obtained, should be utterly set aside. Another party, prepared to be contented by moderate concessions, was composed of the &quot;parali,&quot; the inhabitants of the , the coast. The third was formed by the nobles, called or , because their property lay for the most part in the pedion, the level and most fruitful part of the country. Solon, who enjoyed the confidence of all parties on account of his tried insight and sound judgment, was chosen archon by a compromise, with full power to put an end to the difficulties, and to restore peace by means of legislation. One of the primary measures of Solon was the Seisachtheia (&quot;dis-burdening ordinance&quot;). This gave an immediate relief by cancelling all debts, public and private. At the same time, he made it illegal for the future to secure debts upon the person of the debtor.
Solon also altered the standard of coinage [and of weights and measures], by introducing the Euboic standard in place of the Pheidonian or Aeginetan standard. 100 new drachmae were thus made to contain the same amount of silver as 73 old drachmae.

===Timocracy===
Solon further instituted a timocracy, () and those who did not belong to the nobility received a share in the rights of citizens, according to a scale determined by their property and their corresponding services to the Athenian State. For this purpose, he divided the population into four classes, founded on the possession of land:
# &quot;pentacosiomedimni&quot; (or &quot;pentacosiomedimnoi&quot;) – who had at least 500 &quot;medimni&quot; of produce as yearly income
# &quot;hippeis&quot; – knights, with at least 300 &quot;medimni&quot;
# &quot;zeugitae&quot; – possessors of a yoke of oxen, with at least 150 &quot;medimni&quot;
# &quot;thetes&quot; – workers for wages, with less than 150 &quot;medimni&quot; of yearly income

Solon&#x27;s legislation only granted to the first three of these four classes a vote in the election of responsible officers, and only to the first class the power of election to the highest offices; as, for instance, that of archon. The first three classes were bound to serve as hoplites; the cavalry was raised out of the first two, while the fourth class was only employed as light-armed troops or on the fleet, and apparently for pay. The others served without pay. The holders of office in the State were also unpaid.

Each division had different rights; for example, the &quot;pentacosiomedimnoi&quot; could be archons, while &quot;thetes&quot; could only attend the Athenian assembly. The fourth class was excluded from all official positions, but possessed the right of voting in the general public assemblies (the Heliaia) which chose officials and passed laws. They had also the right of taking part in the trials by jury which Solon had instituted.

===Council of the Four Hundred===
Solon established a constitutional order with a single chief consultative body, and a single administrative body. Solon established as the chief consultative body the Council of the Four Hundred, in which only the first three classes took part, and as chief administrative body the Areopagus, which was to be filled up by those who had been archons.

<text>USS &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; (DD-754), was an in service with the United States Navy. She was named in honor of United States Marine Corps Brigadier General Frank Evans, a leader of the American Expeditionary Force in France during World War I. She served late in World War II and during the Korean War and Vietnam War before she was cut in half in a collision with the Royal Australian Navy aircraft carrier in 1969.

== Construction ==
&quot;Frank E. Evans&quot;′s keel was laid at the Bethlehem Steel Company&#x27;s shipyard in Staten Island. She was launched on 3 October 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Frank E. Evans, widow of Brigadier General Evans, and commissioned on 3 February 1945.

== Service history ==

=== World War II ===
&quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor. Territory of Hawaii, on 18 May 1945 for her final training, then crossed the Pacific Ocean to Eniwetok, Guam, Ulithi, and Okinawa on escort duty. Reaching action waters on 24 June 1945, she was assigned to radar picket and local escort duty, often firing on Japanese aircraft. After the close of hostilities in World War II on 15 August 1945, she patrolled the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea, embarked released Americans from prisoner-of-war camps near Dalian, Manchuria, and covered occupation landings at Jinsen, Korea.

=== 1946–1949 ===
&quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; continued to operate in East Asia until 6 March 1946, when she departed Qingdao, China, bound for San Francisco, California. Immobilized there on 31 March 1946, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 14 December 1949.

=== Korean War ===
Recommissioned on 15 September 1950 for service in the Korean War, &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; sailed from San Diego, California, on 2 January 1951 for duty with the United States Seventh Fleet. On 26 February 1951, she began to play her part in the lengthy siege of Wonsan, during which she engaged North Korean shore batteries 11 times. On 18 June 1951, she was struck by 30 shrapnel hits, which caused minor wounds to four crewmembers, before she silenced the North Korean artillery battery that was firing at her. During this time, &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; received the nicknames &quot;Lucky Evans&quot; and the &quot;Gray Ghost&quot;. During her tour of duty off Korea, she also bombarded targets in the Songjin-Chongjin area, rescued downed aviators, and coordinated and controlled day and night bombing missions by United Nations aircraft. She returned to San Diego on 4 September 1951.

&quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; departed on 22 March 1952 for her second Korean War tour, serving on patrol and bombardment duty along the coast of Korea and on the Taiwan Patrol before returning to her new home port, Long Beach, California, on 6 November 1952, where she remained for three months. Her third Korean War tour from 13 June to 20 December 1953 coincided with the Korean armistice that brought the war to a close on 27 July 1953, and was devoted primarily to patrol duty.

=== 1954–1964 ===

While riding out Typhoon Pamela in the Taiwan Strait in early November 1954, &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; responded to an SOS by the Military Sea Transportation Service cargo ship , which had lost steering control near the center of the storm. &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; had escaped to the edge of the typhoon, but turned back into the storm, racing for five hours toward &quot;Muskingum&quot; to render assistance and taking damage in the process. In the end, &quot;Muskingum&quot; was able to regain control before &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; arrived, but the incident was widely publicized in newspaper syndication because Pulitzer Prize-winning correspondent Homer Bigart was reporting from aboard &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; at the time.

From 1954 to 1960, &quot;Evans&quot; completed five tours of duty in the East Asia and conducted extensive training operations along the United States West Coast and in the Hawaiian Islands, occasionally with Royal Canadian Navy ships.

From 1962 to 1963, &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; portrayed the fictitious destroyer USS &quot;Appleby&quot; in the NBC situation comedy &quot;Ensign O&#x27;Toole&quot;, starring Dean Jones in the title role.

=== Vietnam War ===
During the Vietnam War, &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; served in the waters off Vietnam for 12 days from July to September 1965. She again operated in the vicinity of Vietnam for 61 days from August to November 1966. and for 66 days from October 1967 to 20 February 1968. During the Tet Offensive, &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; provided naval gunfire support to the United States Army&#x27;s 101st Airborne Division against the Viet Cong 840th Battalion near Phan Thiết, South Vietnam, on 3 February 1968. She spent an additional 14 days in the Vietnam war zone in 1969.

=== Collision with HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot; ===
At around 0300 on 3 June 1969, &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; was operating in darkness in the South China Sea between Vietnam and Spratly Island in a formation with ships of the Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy, and Royal New Zealand Navy. All ships in the formation were running without lights. The Royal Australian Navy aircraft carrier &quot;Melbourne&quot; was in the process of going to flying stations and radioed &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot;, then to port of her, to take up station as the rescue destroyer. This required &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; to reduce speed and take up station on &quot;Melbourne&quot;′s port quarter. The commanding officer of &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; was asleep in his quarters, having left instructions to be awakened if there were to be any changes in the formation. Neither the officer of the deck nor the junior officer of the deck notified him when the station change was ordered. The bridge crew also did not contact the combat information center to request clarification of the positions and movements of the surrounding ships.

The conning officer on &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; misunderstood the formation&#x27;s base course and believed &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; was to starboard of &quot;Melbourne&quot;. &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; therefore turned to starboard, cutting across &quot;Melbourne&quot;′s bow twice in the process. &quot;Melbourne&quot; struck &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; at a point about from her bow on her port side and cut her in two at . After the collision, &quot;Frank E. Evans&quot;′s bow drifted off to the port side of &quot;Melbourne&quot; and sank in less than five minutes, taking 73 of her crew with it. One body was recovered from the water, making a total of 74 dead. Her stern scraped along the starboard side of &quot;Melbourne&quot;, and &quot;Melbourne&quot;′s crew attached lines to it. It remained afloat. Around 60 to 100 men were rescued from the water.

== Decommissioning and disposal ==
&quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; was decommissioned at Subic Bay and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1969. The stern section was sunk as a target in Subic Bay on 10 October 1969.

== Awards ==

<doc id="200430" wikidata="Q1129110" url="?curid=200430" title="USS Admiralty Islands">
<text>USS &quot;Admiralty Islands&quot; (CVE-99) was the forty-fifth of fifty built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named after the Admiralty Islands campaign, a series of battles against isolated Japanese forces throughout the Admiralty Islands in the Bismarck Archipelago. The ship was launched in May 1944, commissioned in June, and served as a replenishment carrier, under the command of Capt. Edward Hastings Eldredge, in support of the invasion of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in November 1946, when she was mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in January 1947.

==Design and description==
&quot;Admiralty Islands&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, she had a beam of , at her widest point, this was , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20 mm cannons, and the amount of 40 mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Although &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. Because &quot;Admiralty Islands&quot; only operated in a replenishment capability, she usually operated with about 60 aircraft on board, the maximum carrying capacity at which take-offs would still be possible.

==Construction==

Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942, under the name &quot;Chaplin Bay&quot;, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was renamed &quot;Admiralty Islands&quot; on 26 April 1944, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers after naval or land engagements. As the ninety-ninth escort carrier, and the forty-fifth of the Casablanca class carriers, she received the hull symbol CVE-99. The escort carrier was laid down on 26 February 1944, MC hull 1136, the forty-fourth of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She was launched on 10 May 1944; sponsored by the wife of Vice Admiral Homer N. Wallin; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 13 June 1944.

==Service history==

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Admiralty Islands&quot; got underway, on 2 July 1944, from Astoria, Oregon on a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Francisco. Upon arriving, she took on fuel oil and aviation gas. Proceeding southwards, she arrived at San Diego on 14 July, for additional training. There, she was assigned to join the Carrier Transport Squadron of the Pacific Fleet, ferrying aircraft, personnel, and supplies to the frontline in the West Pacific. She took on a load of cargo at San Diego, and departed westwards.

Transiting via Pearl Harbor, &quot;Admiralty Islands&quot; headed to Majuro, in the Marshall Islands, arriving there on 9 August, where she disembarked her cargo. She returned to Pearl Harbor, where she transported aircraft and personnel back to the West Coast, arriving at San Francisco on 24 August. She then made another round-trip transport run in September, this time to Finschhafen, New Guinea. She returned to San Diego on 7 October, where she underwent refit from 8 October to 26 October. On 29 October, she left port, headed northwards towards Alameda, where she loaded aircraft and passengers from Naval Air Station Alameda. She then commenced another trip to Finschhafen, arriving on 21 November. Upon disembarking her load, she proceed to Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands, docking in Seeadler Harbor on 23 November. On her way back, she stopped at Pearl Harbor from 6 to 7 December, before reaching San Diego a week later. There, she loaded more aircraft and military passengers, and sailed westwards, touching Pearl Harbor on 24 December. On 26 December, the day after Christmas, she left port, bound for Guam.
Upon reaching Guam on 6 January 1945, &quot;Admiralty Islands&quot; conducted training operations for two days, before sailing for Hawaii on 10 January. She reached Pearl Harbor on 20 January, where repairs were made to her main engine, finishing on 31 January. Upon the completion of repairs, she was assigned to become a replenishment carrier as a part of Task Group 50.8.4, the mobile replenishment group supporting the frontline Fifth Fleet. Replenishment carriers enabled larger fleet carriers to operate out at sea for extended periods of time without having to withdraw to port. She served alongside three other escort carriers, , , and . She took on a complement of sixty-one replacement planes at Pearl Harbor, and she left port on 2 February, bound for the waters off of Iwo Jima, in support of the planned landings there. After stopping at Eniwetok and Ulithi, she began replenishment operations on 16 February, continuing throughout the next five months.

On 2 March, the carrier returned to Guam for provisioning and minor repairs. On 13 March, she sortied, this time in support of the prolonged Battle of Okinawa. This time, her task group had the task of resupplying both the escort carriers and the fleet carriers of the Fast Carrier Task Force. Throughout this period, she received provisions and aircraft from Guam, making trips to and from the island. On 18 April, &quot;Admiralty Islands&quot; suffered an operational casualty from a Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter crashing into her flight deck. At 12:17, she sounded flight quarters, and she commenced launching replacement aircraft at 13:52, delivering one Grumman F6F Hellcat, two Grumman TBM Avengers, and two Curtiss SB2C Helldivers to the fleet carrier . At 14:06, she began recovering ten combat-fatigued aircraft (commonly known as &quot;Flyable Duds&quot;) from &quot;Essex&quot;.
The first aircraft which attempted to land was a Hellcat, piloted by Ensign Roy Edward Jones. As it approached &quot;Admiralty Islands&quot;, the pilot received a signal to abort its landing, after it responded poorly to &quot;low&quot; and &quot;opposite slant&quot; flag signals. With the &quot;wave off&quot; signal from the Landing Signal Officer (LSO) being sent late, the aircraft continued to lose altitude. As the pilot applied full throttle, its tail hook caught the No 5. arresting wire, forcing the aircraft onto a gun mount, splitting the fighter in half. The cockpit and engine were ejected into the ocean, whilst the latter half dangled off the wire. The carrier&#x27;s crew was unable to retrieve the front half of the fighter, nor the body of the pilot. The LSO was forced to jump into the safety net, breaking his leg.

&quot;Admiralty Islands&quot; returned to Guam on 24 April for repairs to her boilers, two of which had become dysfunctional. Whilst she was moored for repairs, the other three escort carriers of her task group endured Typhoon Connie, which transited northwards through the waters east of Okinawa. Upon the completion of repairs, she departed on 14 May to continue replenishment duties. She continued these duties throughout May, before being detached and transiting, via Guam, to Saipan on 15 June. She remained in port for two weeks, before being assigned to Task Group 30.8, the Fleet Oiler and Transport Group which was supporting the Third Fleet, which was conducting airstrikes against the Japanese mainland. She suffered another casualty on 20 July, when aircraft from one of the fleet carriers conducting strikes was diverted to &quot;Admiralty Islands&quot; because its home carrier had experienced a crash landing, with a resulting fire. All of the aircraft landed safely, except for one, which was unable to eject its spare belly-mounted gasoline tanks. As the plane circled the carrier, refusing the order to ditch and struggling to jettison its belly tank, the rest of the aircraft had already been stowed beyond the forward wire barriers.

With the aircraft stored away, the plane was given the greenlight to attempt a landing, some forty-five minutes before sunset. As the plane caught the first arresting gear, the gasoline tank detached, skidded down the flight deck, hit a crewman, and exploded, killing the man. The explosion sprayed burning gasoline onto the parked planes, and set alight the wooden flight deck. An aircraft mechanic, Glenn Barton, said about the crash, &quot;When the tank hit the deck, there was a tidal wave of flame that went across, and I raced the burning gas across the deck&quot;. The fire forced the evacuation of the bridge, and the engines were cut to deny the fire wind. It appears that the pilot of the landing plane escaped without injury. As a result of the damage sustained from this accident, &quot;Admiralty Island&quot; was ordered to detach from the task group and to retire to the West Coast. On 21 July, she was detached from Task Group 30.8, and she steamed for Guam, where she unloaded her cargo, and refueled.

After refueling, &quot;Admiralty Islands&quot; proceeded to the West Coast, arriving at San Diego on 11 August, before heading northwards to San Pedro for refit. Most of the planned alterations were cancelled, as a result of the Japanese surrender being announced on 15 August. Nonetheless, repairs were conducted, and on 1 September, she was assigned to join the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; fleet, which repatriated servicemen from throughout the Pacific.

She conducted &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; runs until 24 April 1946, when she was decommissioned. She was struck from the Navy list on 8 May, and the hull was sold on 2 January 1947 to the Zidell Machinery and Supply Company of Portland, Oregon. She was ultimately broken up just miles from where she was constructed. &quot;Admiralty Islands&quot; received three battle stars for her World War II service.
