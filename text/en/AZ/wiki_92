<text>ETH Zurich (; ) is a public research university in Zurich, Switzerland. Founded in 1854 with the stated mission to educate engineers and scientists, the university focuses primarily on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. 

Like its sister institution EPFL, ETH Zurich is part of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain, a consortium of universities and research institutes under the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research. , ETH Zurich enrolled 25,380 students from over 120 countries, of which 4,425 were pursuing doctoral degrees.

Students, faculty, and researchers affiliated with ETH Zurich include 22 Nobel laureates, two Fields Medalists, three Pritzker Prize winners, and one Turing Award recipient, including Albert Einstein and John von Neumann. It is a founding member of the IDEA League and the International Alliance of Research Universities (IARU), and a member of the CESAER and League of European Research Universities (LERU) networks and the ENHANCE Alliance.

==History==
ETH Zurich was founded on 7 February 1854 by the Swiss Confederation and began giving its first lectures on 16 October 1855 as a polytechnic institute (&quot;eidgenössische polytechnische Schule&quot;) at various sites throughout the city of Zurich. It was initially composed of six faculties: architecture, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry, forestry, and an integrated department for the fields of mathematics, natural sciences, literature, and social and political sciences.

It is locally still known as &quot;Polytechnikum&quot;, or simply as &quot;Poly&quot;, derived from the original name &quot;eidgenössische polytechnische Schule&quot;, which translates to &quot;federal polytechnic school&quot;.

ETH Zurich is a &quot;federal&quot; institute (i.e., under direct administration by the Swiss government), whereas the University of Zurich is a &quot;cantonal&quot; institution. The decision for a new federal university was heavily disputed at the time; the liberals pressed for a &quot;federal university&quot;, while the conservative forces wanted all universities to remain under cantonal control, worried that the liberals would gain more political power than they already had. In the beginning, both universities were co-located in the buildings of the University of Zurich.

From 1905 to 1908, under the presidency of Jérôme Franel, the course program of ETH Zurich was restructured to that of a real university and ETH Zurich was granted the right to award doctorates. In 1909, the first doctorates were awarded. In 1911, it was given its current name, &quot;Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule&quot;. In 1924, another reorganization structured the university in 12 departments. However, it now has 16 departments.

ETH Zurich, the EPFL, and four associated research institutes form the &quot;ETH Domain&quot; with the aim of collaborating on scientific projects.

==Rankings==
Historically, ETH Zurich has achieved its reputation particularly in the fields of chemistry, mathematics and physics. There are 32 Nobel laureates who are associated with ETH Zurich, the most recent of whom is Didier Queloz, awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2019. Albert Einstein is perhaps its most famous alumnus.
=== Overall rankings ===
ETH Zurich is ranked 7th worldwide (first in Switzerland) in the QS World University Rankings 2025, 11th worldwide (first in Switzerland) in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024, and 20th worldwide in the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2023. ETH Zurich ranked 1st in Europe in the 2025 QS Europe rankings. In the 2023 Nature Index of academic institutions, ETH Zurich ranked 20th worldwide and first in Switzerland.

=== Subject/Area rankings ===

==Campus==


ETH Zurich has two campuses, namely &quot;Zentrum&quot; and &quot;Hönggerberg&quot;. The &quot;Zentrum&quot; campus grew around the main building, which was constructed 1858–1864 outside and right above the eastern border of the town, but which is nowadays located right in the heart of the city. As the town and university grew, ETH Zurich spread into the surrounding vineyards and later quarters. Because this geographic situation substantially hindered the expansion of ETH Zurich, a new campus was built from 1964 to 1976 on the &quot;Hönggerberg&quot;, a northern hill in the outskirts of the city. The last major expansion project of this new campus was completed in 2003. 

===Zentrum campus===
The &quot;Zentrum&quot; campus consists of various buildings and institutions throughout the city of Zurich.

The &quot;Zentrum&quot; campus houses the:
* Department of Mathematics (D-MATH)
* Department of Computer Science (D-INFK)
* Department of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences (D-GESS)
* Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (D-ITET)
* Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering (D-MAVT)
* Department of Environmental Systems Science (D-USYS)
* Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences (D-EAPS)
* Department of Management, Technology, and Economics (D-MTEC)
* Department of Health Sciences and Technology (D-HEST)

====Main building====

The main building of ETH Zurich was built from 1858 to 1864 under Gustav Zeuner; the architect, however, was Gottfried Semper, who was a professor of architecture at ETH Zurich at the time and one of the most important architectural writers and theorists of the age. Semper worked in a neoclassical style that was unique to him; and the namesake and architect of the Semperoper in Dresden. It emphasized bold and clear massings with a detailing, such as the rusticated ground level and giant order above, that derived in part from the work of Andrea Palladio and Donato Bramante. During the construction of the University of Zurich, the south wing of the building was allocated to the University until its own new main building was constructed (1912–1914). At about the same time, Semper&#x27;s ETH Zurich building was enlarged and received its cupola.

The main building stands directly across the street from the University Hospital of Zurich and, right alongside the main building of the University of Zurich.

===Hönggerberg campus===

The &quot;Hönggerberg&quot; campus is a more classical university campus, consisting mainly of university buildings and student accommodation.

The &quot;Hönggerberg&quot; campus houses the:
* Department of Architecture (D-ARCH)
* Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (D-BAUG)
* Department of Materials (D-MATL)
* Department of Biology (D-BIOL)
* Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences (D-CHAB)
* Department of Physics (D-PHYS)

There is also an ASVZ sports centre which is accessible to all students and faculty, and includes a gym, beach volleyball court, football field, and martial-art rooms.

====Science City====

In 2005, the year of ETH Zurich&#x27;s 150th anniversary, an extensive project called &quot;Science City&quot; for the Hönggerberg Campus was started with the goal to transform the campus into an attractive district based on the principle of sustainability.

====ETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics====
The ETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics (LIB) is a physics laboratory located in Science City. It specializes in accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) and the use of ion beam based techniques with applications in archeology, earth sciences, life sciences, material sciences and fundamental physics. An example of such application is the tracing of isotopes and the detection of rare radionuclides with radiocarbon dating and the use of techniques such as Rutherford backscattering spectrometry or elastic recoil detection. The LIB is developing the next generation of AMS machines. It is also a laboratory available for users interested in applying the techniques of ion beam analysis.

=== Commuting between the campuses ===

==== ETH Link ====
The ETH link is a free bus for students, affiliates and faculty linking the two campuses. During the school week, the bus runs 3 times an hour, and takes around 15 minutes. In 2020 a new, fully electric, eLink was introduced.

==== Bike share ====
Since 2018, an electric bike sharing system between the two campuses is also available, with yearly subscriptions subsidised by the university. There are rental stations on both campuses.

==Student life==
=== Tuition and financial assistance ===
Being a public university, the heavily subsidized (by Swiss federal tax) tuition fees are CHF 730 per semester, regardless of the student&#x27;s nationality.
Both merit and need based scholarships are also available. 
The Excellence Scholarship &amp; Opportunity Programme (ESOP) is a merit scholarship program for master students with excellent grades in their undergraduate program.

=== Student associations ===
ETH Zurich has well over 100 student associations. Most notable is the VSETH (&quot;Verband der Studierenden an der ETH&quot;) which forms the umbrella organization of all field of study specific student associations and comprises a large variety of committees such as the Student Sustainability Committee and the ETH Model United Nations. The associations regularly organize events with varying size and popularity. Events of the neighboring University of Zurich are well-attended by ETH Zurich students and vice versa. 

The largest career fair on campus is the &quot;Polymesse&quot; which is organized by students in the &quot;Forum und Contact&quot; committee of VSETH. Many student associations however organize career fairs specifically for the students in their departments with companies related to their field of study. The VSETH is also the official representation of the student body towards the school and has been working with ETH on various projects with the aim of improving the students&#x27; experience at ETH. The representation towards the various departments is handled by the respective student associations. 

The &quot;Polyball&quot;, which is the biggest decorated ball in Europe, takes places annually in the main building of ETH and is organized by students and former students in the KOSTA foundation. It has been taking place since the 1880s.

ETH Juniors is another student organization. It forms a bridge between industry and ETH Zurich and offers many services for students and companies alike as a student-led consulting group.

=== Sports ===
The Academic Sports Association of Zurich (ASVZ) offers more than 120 sports. The biggest annual sports event is the &quot;SOLA-Stafette&quot; (SOLA relay race) which consists of 14 sections over a total distance of 140 kilometers. More than 760 teams participated in the 2009 edition. The 40th edition of the SOLA, held on 4 May 2013, had 900 enrolled teams, of which 893 started and 876 were classified. In 2014 ASVZ celebrated their 75th anniversary.

==Innovation==
===Student Project House===
In 2017, ETH Zurich board approved the creation of a &quot;Student Project House&quot; to encourage student projects and foster innovation. A test consisting of a &quot;makerspace&quot; and co-working space was established on the Hönggerberg campus, followed by a 6-story space near the ETH Zurich main building. Both locations function as a unified entity for the purpose of qualifications, staffing and decision making. While both makerspaces offer similar tools, the central one is significantly larger and also hosts a rentable auditorium, intended for pitching projects to faculty to gain funding, and a bar. 

Both makerspaces include workspaces for wood- and metalworking, electronics fabrication, as well as an array of 3D-printers for students to use at a little over material cost. Both also feature a shop for students to buy items such as resistors in lower quantities than ordinarily, while passing down the savings of bulk purchases. The makerspaces are managed and staffed entirely by students, who are paid in shop credit. A new space is expected to open on the Hönggerberg campus in 2024.

===Spin-offs===
ETH Zurich promotes technology and knowledge transfer through an entrepreneurial ecosystem to foster spin-offs and start-ups. 
As of 2022, 527 ETH Zurich spin-off companies had been created.

==Competition teams==
ETH Zurich has three prominent competition teams that perform research in different popular fields and compete on the world stage. Most of these teams are based in the Swiss Innovation Park near Dübendorf.

===ARIS===
The Swiss Academic Spaceflight Initiative (ARIS) () is an organisation at ETH Zurich that focuses on the development of space related technologies. The most prominent area of research is in the development of a sounding rocket that is flown yearly at the Spaceport America Cup. ARIS also dedicates its resources to the academic advancement of spaceflight and hosts projects ranging from the development of Hybrid rocket Engines to Payload research.

====Achievements====

* ARIS won 2nd place at the Spaceport America Cup 2019 in the 10&#x27;000 ft COTS Engine challenge.

===AMZ===
The &quot;Academic Motorsports Association&quot; () is the ETH Zurich&#x27;s equivalent of a Formula One team, that develops electric and driverless sports vehicles that compete at Formula Student.

====Achievements====

AMZ has proven to be one of the most successful teams in the Formula Student history, with in total 13 overall victories (as by September 2021) at Formula Student Events. Highlight was the double victory at the Formula Student Germany (FSG) in the Electric as well as the Driverless Category (autonomous driving car). 
Furthermore, AMZ was leader of the Formula Student world ranking in 2013 – 2015, 2017 &amp; 2018. The team also dominated the autonomous driving category since its introduction in 2017 for three years, winning all the events the team attended with the autonomous car until FSG 2021. 
In 2015, and again since 2016, their car &quot;grimsel&quot; holds the official Guinness world record for fastest acceleration of an electric car, achieving 0–100 km/h in 1.513 seconds. In 2023, AMZ broke the previous world record again and has set a new record of 0-100km/h in 0.956 seconds.

===Swissloop===

Swissloop is the ETH Zurich&#x27;s newest competition team that is working on the development of a Hyperloop system.

==Traditions==
The annual &quot;Polyball&quot; is the most prestigious public event at ETH Zurich, with a long tradition since the 1880s. At the end of November, the &quot;Polyball&quot; welcomes around 10,000 dancers, music-lovers and partygoers in the extensively decorated main building of ETH Zurich. This is the biggest decorated ball in Europe.

The amicable rivalry between ETH Zurich and its neighbor, the University of Zurich, has been cultivated since 1951 (Uni-Poly). There has been an annual rowing match between teams from the two institutions on the river Limmat.

There are many regular symposia and conferences at ETH Zurich, most notably the annual &quot;Wolfgang Pauli Lectures&quot;, in honor of former ETH Zurich Professor Wolfgang Pauli. Distinct lecturers, among them 24 Nobel laureates, have held lectures of the various fields of natural sciences at this conference since 1962.

==Notable alumni and faculty==
ETH Zurich has produced and attracted many famous scientists in its short history, including Albert Einstein and John von Neumann. More than twenty Nobel laureates have either studied at ETH Zurich or were awarded the Nobel Prize for their work achieved at ETH Zurich. Other alumni include scientists who were distinguished with the highest accolades such as the Fields Medal, Pritzker Prize and Turing Award, among other distinctions in their respective fields. Academic achievements aside, ETH Zurich has been alma mater to many Olympic medalists and world champions.

<text>Astra is the brand name for a number of geostationary communication satellites, both individually and as a group, which are owned and operated by SES, a global satellite operator based in Betzdorf, in eastern Luxembourg. The name is also used to describe the pan-European broadcasting system provided by these satellites, the channels carried on them, and even the reception equipment.

At the time of the launch of the first Astra satellite, Astra 1A in 1988, the satellite&#x27;s operator was known as Société Européenne des Satellites (&quot;European Satellite Company&quot;). In 2001 SES Astra, a newly formed subsidiary of SES, operated the Astra satellites and in September 2011, SES Astra was consolidated back into the parent company, which by this time also operated other satellite families such as AMC, and NSS.

Astra satellites broadcast 2,600 digital television channels (675 in high definition) via five main satellite orbital positions to households across Asia, Australia, Africa, Americas, Europe, New Zealand, Middle East and North Africa. The satellites have been instrumental in the establishment of satellite TV and the introduction of digital TV, HDTV, 3D TV, and Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) in Europe.

A book, &quot;High Above&quot;, telling the story of the creation and development of the Astra satellites and their contribution to developments in the European TV and media industry, was published in April 2010 to mark the 25th anniversary of SES.

== Satellites ==
There are 11 fully-operational Astra satellites and another 2 as backup/reserve, the majority in four orbital locations - Astra 19.2°E, Astra 28.2°E, Astra 23.5°E, Astra 5°E. Astra&#x27;s principle of &quot;co-location&quot; (several satellites are maintained close to each other, all within a cube with a size of .) increases flexibility and redundancy. Orbital data for the active satellites can be accessed &quot;here&quot;

== Manufacture and launch ==
Astra satellites have been designed by Boeing Satellite Systems (formerly Hughes Space and Communications), Airbus Defence and Space (formerly Astrium), Alcatel Space, Lockheed Martin and Thales Alenia Space. The Astra satellites within a family are not necessarily identical. For example, of the Astra 2 satellites; Astra 2A and Astra 2C were BSS 601HPs, Astra 2B an Astrium Eurostar E2000+, Astra 2D a BSS 376 and Astra 2E, Astra 2F and Astra 2G are all Eurostar E3000s.

The satellites have been launched by Arianespace by Ariane launch vehicles from Kourou, French Guiana, International Launch Services (ILS) Proton launch vehicles from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, ILS Atlas launch vehicles from Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States and SpaceX Falcon 9 Block 5 rockets also from Cape Canaveral. The satellites are launched into an elliptical &quot;temporary transfer orbit&quot; from where they use onboard propulsion to reach their final circular geostationary orbits, at nearly altitude. Proton launch vehicles fitted with a fourth stage propulsion unit are capable of launching the satellites several thousand kilometres higher (at the closest point of the elliptical orbit) than Ariane launch vehicles, and so most satellites launched in this way use less fuel to reach their geostationary orbit. More recent Astra satellites are built with an all-electric propulsion system for orbit raising and in-orbit manoeuvres to save weight.

=== Sirius and Astra 4A ===
The Sirius series of satellites (not connected with the North American Sirius Satellite Radio service) was started in 1993 with the purchase of the BSB Marcopolo 1 satellite (renamed Sirius 1) by Nordic Satellite AB (NSAB) for direct to home broadcasts to the Nordic and Baltic regions from the 5°East orbital position. Subsequent satellites launched to this location include Sirius 2 (1997), Sirius 3 (1998) and Sirius 4 (2007) and the position&#x27;s coverage has been expanded to include Eastern Europe and Africa.

In 2000, SES (then SES Astra) bought the 50% shareholding in NSAB owned by Teracom and Tele Danmark and in 2003 increased that holding to 75%, renaming the company SES Sirius AB. In 2008, Astra acquired further shares to take its shareholding in SES Sirius to 90% and in March 2010 took full control of the company. In June 2010, the affiliate company was renamed SES Astra and the Sirius 4 satellite renamed Astra 4A.

The Astra 4A designation was originally given in 2005 to part of the NSS-10 craft (33 transponders) owned by another subsidiary of SES, SES New Skies, and positioned at 37.5°W for broadcast, data, and telecommunications into Africa, and in 2007 to part of the Sirius 4 satellite (six transponders of the FSS Africa beam) owned and operated by SES Sirius. From June 2010, the Astra 4A designation has applied to the entire satellite previously known as Sirius 4.

=== Failures ===
Astra 1K, the largest commercial communications satellite ever built at the time, was ordered by SES in 1997. It was launched by Proton rocket on 26 November 2002. The launch vehicle lifted off as planned and reached its parking orbit at which point the final stage of the launch vehicle was to initiate a second burn to transfer the satellite to its geostationary orbit. This did not occur and the satellite was released into the parking orbit, making it unusable. The only way to recover the satellite would have been the use of a Space Shuttle, however this was rejected. On 10 December 2002, SES instructed Alcatel Space (the manufacturer) and the French Space Agency CNES to deorbit the satellite, it broke up on re-entry over the Pacific Ocean.

On 16 January 2009, Astra 5A at Astra 31.5°E &quot;experienced a technical anomaly leading to the end of the spacecraft&#x27;s mission&quot;, some four years ahead of the spacecraft&#x27;s expected end of life. Traffic carried by the satellite (especially channels for German cable service, Kabel Deutschland) was transferred to Astra 23.5°E. In March 2009, SES (then SES Astra) announced that in April, the Astra 2C satellite was to be moved from the Astra 28.2°E position to 31.5°E to temporarily take over Astra 5A&#x27;s mission until Astra 3B is launched to Astra 23.5°E, when another craft currently there can be released to 31.5°E. The move of Astra 2C was started in May 2009 and completed on 11 May 2009, with the first transponders coming into use at the new position in the subsequent two weeks.

== Broadcasting statistics ==
At the end of 2021, Astra satellite broadcasts were received in 170 million households in Europe. In Germany, the largest market for Astra broadcasts, 17 million households receive TV via satellite (15.93 million receiving satellite channels in HD) out of 37.22 million TV households (33.76 million HD TV households) in the country with take-up of other TV delivery methods as follows:

<text>Hawarden (; ) is a village and community in Flintshire, Wales. It is part of the Deeside conurbation on the Wales-England border and is home to Hawarden Castle. In the 2011 census the ward of the same name had a population of 1,887, whereas the community of the same name, which also includes Ewloe (which also has a castle) Mancot and Aston had a population of 13,920.
The scenic wooded Hawarden Park abuts the clustered settlement in the south. Hawarden Bridge consists of distribution and industrial business premises beyond Shotton/Queensferry and the Dee. The west of the main street is called The Highway, its start marked by the crossroads with a fountain in the middle, near which are public houses, some with restaurants.

The village is from Chester. In 2014 it was named in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;″ annual Best Places To Live List.

The highest temperature in Wales was recorded in Hawarden on 18 July 2022 at 37.1°C. The previous highest temperature recorded in Wales, 35.2°C, was also recorded in Hawarden on 2 August 1990. Hawarden has held this record almost continuously, until it was replaced for a few hours by Gogerddan which recorded a temperature of 35.3°C on 18 July 2022, first breaking the Welsh record, after which Hawarden surpassed Gogerddan.

== Etymology ==
Both the English and Welsh names of the village allude to its elevated geographical position. English &#x27; is from Old English &#x27; &quot;high&quot; + &#x27; &#x27;enclosure&#x27; and has had its bisyllabic pronunciation since the sixteenth century, its trisyllabic, now solely written, form being due to the influence of Welsh, which stresses and therefore kept the penultimate syllable. The Welsh name &#x27; is older than &#x27; and is a compound of &#x27; &quot;high ground&quot; + &#x27;, which is most likely a form of &#x27; &#x27;rich in cattle&#x27; although may be a personal name.

==History==
The 1848 Topographical Dictionary of Wales led by Samuel Lewis states that Hawarden is of remote antiquity and was called &#x27;Pennard Halawg&#x27;, or more properly &#x27;Pen-y-Llwch&#x27;, the headland above the lake. The hill forts such as the huge remains next to the medieval Hawarden Castle and Trueman&#x27;s Hill motte were - it records locally - believed to date to the time of fortifications against incursions of the Cornavii tribe and the Romans.

The Normans recorded that the Saxons called the place Haordine where, east of today&#x27;s village, was the principal manor of the Saxon Hundred of Atiscros. William the Conqueror granted the lands and manor to Hugh Lupus since it formed part of the County Palatine of Chester, whereupon Hawarden Castle was built and later proved key to Welsh history, at that time lived in by Roger Fitzvalerine, then the Montaults, or de Montaltos, barons of Mold, who held it as seneschal. 
Efforts to subdue north Welsh territory into a degree of fiefdom followed intermittently, with no great success. In the castle Llewellyn of Wales who was in possession negotiated peace in 1264 with Simon de Montford, who led a brief rebellion against Henry III of England and agreed to betroth his daughter to Llewellyn in exchange for restoring the &quot;de facto&quot; Welsh castle to Robert de Montault. The rebellion failed. Accordingly, by 1280 the castle became a crown asset, listed as a &quot;Castrum Regis&quot;. Later, following Edward&#x27;s successful campaign imposing exacting terms on the Welsh, building Flint Castle and strengthening other castles, in 1282 Llewellyn&#x27;s brother Dafydd took the castle back, killing the garrison and transferring Roger de Clifford to remote Snowdon. This second recapture of the castle triggered Edward&#x27;s killing of Llewellyn and annexation of Wales. The castle became a prized possession: see Hawarden Castle.

The village of Saltney (next to Chester, but in Wales) was part of the parish.

===19th century===
The prime minister William Ewart Gladstone (1809–1898) spent his later life in Hawarden Castle, which had in the Glorious Revolution been acquired by his wife&#x27;s family, the Glynne baronets. In 1847 water was brought into the place at an expense of upwards of £1000 to be recouped by the River Dee Company. In the nineteenth century the economy of the parish (about three times larger than the modern Community Council area) involved weekly markets, many seams of coal, the making of tiles, bricks and drainage pipes and chemicals such as Glauber salts and ivory black making.

In 1886 the curate of Hawarden, the Rev. Harry Drew, married Mary Gladstone, the second daughter of the Prime Minister, at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster – a society wedding attended by the Prince of Wales.

Gladstone bequeathed his library to the town under the name of St Deiniol&#x27;s Library in honour of the patron saint of the parish church next door. It is the only residential library in Britain and was renamed Gladstone&#x27;s Library in 2010.

==Education==
Hawarden Village Church School (previously Rector Drew Primary School) is the junior school of the village. Hawarden High School is a high school which dates back to 1606 and was attended by Michael Owen and Gary Speed, the former manager of the Wales national football team.

In 1927, Knutsford Ordination Test School relocated to Hawarden — first to the Old Rectory, then to the new castle in 1939 before it closed the following year.

==Economy==
Queensferry consists predominantly of industrial, commercial and storage businesses by the River Dee and is situated to immediately northeast of the community - the village is residential. moneysupermarket.com has significant premises at St David&#x27;s Park by the main A55 road in nearby Ewloe.

Hawarden Airport, sometimes called &quot;Hawarden (Chester) Airport&quot;, with adjoining Hawarden Industrial Park is in nearby Broughton.

At the lowest level of local government, Hawarden Community Council elects or co-opts twenty-one community councillors from three wards namely Hawarden Aston, Hawarden Ewloe and Hawarden Mancot.

There are three identical electoral wards for Flintshire County Council, each of which elects two councillors.

The county archives, the Flintshire Record Office, are housed in the Old Rectory at Hawarden.

==Transport==
Close towns include Connah&#x27;s Quay , Mold , Flint and the city of Wrexham .

Hawarden railway station is on the Borderlands line with services direct to Birkenhead to the north and to Wrexham to the south.

There are three interchanges with local roads onto the major A55 road linking North Wales to Chester and the major A494 road linking Dolgellau via Mold to the Wirral where it divides into the roads towards Liverpool and Manchester (the M53 and M56 motorways) - the village has a choice of three routes towards Chester city centre.

Hawarden Airport lies some east of the village.

<text>National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) is a public research university in Hsinchu, Taiwan. It was first founded in Beijing. After the Chinese Civil War, president Mei Yiqi and other academics fled with the retreating Nationalist government to Taiwan, where they founded National Tsing Hua University in 1956. The university remains independent and distinct from Tsinghua University in Beijing.

The university is part of a leading research and innovation cluster in Taiwan, along with nearby National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, National Space Organization, National Health Research Institutes, Industrial Technology Research Institute, National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, National Center for High-Performance Computing, Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institute, and Industrial Technology Research Institute. The research cluster and its neighboring Hsinchu Science Park together play a key role in the global semiconductor industry.

There are 12 colleges or schools, 26 departments and 31 graduate institutes affiliated to NTHU. The college of Nuclear Science of NTHU is the sole educational and research institution focusing on the peaceful applications of nuclear power in Taiwan. NTHU is affiliated with National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, National Central University and National Chengchi University as part of the University System of Taiwan (UST).

NTHU has educated a wide range of notable alumni, including Yuan Tseh Lee.

==Overview==

In 1955, the President of Tsinghua University in Beijing, Mei Yi-chi left and re-established the National Tsing Hua Institute of Nuclear Technology in Hsinchu, and later based on the foundation of the original institute, National Tsing Hua University was founded in Taiwan.

The two Tsinghua universities both claim to be successors of the original Tsinghua University. As a result of this dispute, the universities claimed to be the rightful recipient of the funds from the Boxer Rebellion indemnity that was used to start Tsinghua University. This indemnity was transferred to the university in Taiwan after the Nationalist government (Kuomintang) retreated to Taiwan.

The two Tsinghua universities cooperated in the establishment of the Tsinghua Strait Research Institute, dual degree program, MOOC program, and academic exchange program.

==History==

After American Secretary of State John Hay suggested that US$30 million Boxer Rebellion indemnity money paid to the United States was excessive, in 1909, President Roosevelt and the U.S. Congress agreed to reduce the Qing Dynasty&#x27;s indemnity payments by US$10.8 million, on the condition that the funding be used as scholarships for Chinese students to study in the United States. Using this fund, Tsinghua College (, &quot;Qīnghuá Xuétáng&quot;) was established in Beijing, China, on 22 April 1911 on the site of a former royal garden belonging to a prince. It was initially a preparatory school for students sent by the government to study in the United States. The faculty members for the sciences were recruited by the YMCA from the United States and its graduates transferred directly to American schools as juniors upon graduation. In 1925, the school established its College Department and started its research institute on Chinese Study.

In 1928, the authority officially changed its name to National Tsing Hua University (NTHU). During the Second World War in 1937, Tsinghua University, Peking University, and Nankai University merged to form Changsha Temporary University in Changsha, and later National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming. After the war, Tsinghua moved back to Beijing and resumed its operation there.

During the Sino-Japanese War, the library lost 200,000 volumes, out of a total of 350,000.

In 1956, National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) was reinstalled on its current campus in Hsinchu, Taiwan. Since its reinstallation, NTHU has developed from an institute focusing on Nuclear Science and Technology to that of a comprehensive research university offering degrees programs ranging from baccalaureate to doctorate in science, technology, engineering, humanities and social sciences, as well as management. NTHU has been consistently ranked as one of the premier universities in Taiwan and is widely recognized as the best incubator for future leaders in industries as well as academics. Such stellar records are particularly exemplified by the outstanding achievements of alumni, including two Nobel laureates in physics (Dr. Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee), one Nobel laureate in chemistry (Dr. Yuan-Tseh Lee) and one Wolf Prize winner in mathematics (Dr. Shiing-Shen Chern).

In recent decades, the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan has had increasingly close ties with the Tsinghua University in People&#x27;s Republic of China (China). Of all universities on Taiwan, the NTHU has arguably one of the strongest cooperations with universities in mainland China in academic research, projects, and with the creation of programs such as the &quot;Center for Contemporary China&quot;.

The first astronomical satellite by Taiwan&#x27;s space agency (TASA) is developed by NTHU and Academia Sinica. It is called The Gamma-ray Transients Monitor and is a cubesat with the goal of tracking Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) and other bright gamma-ray transients with energies ranging from 50 keV to 2 MeV. It will be deployed to orbit by Falcon 9 in Q4 2026.

==Tradition==
===Meichu Tournament===

The Mei-Chu Tournament, held in March annually, is a sport competition between National Tsing Hua University and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. Since its establishment in 1969, the tournament, also known as the Mei-Chu Games, has become a tradition, and is considered one of the most important activities between these two prestigious universities in Taiwan.

The history of the Meichu Games goes back to the 1960s. After the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, National Tsing Hua University and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University were both relocated in Hsinchu, Taiwan and became neighbors. The geographic and academic closeness prompted many intellectual and social exchanges between two universities.

In 1966, an informal tournament was held. The arrangement of the formal event, however, was not institutionalized until 1968, when Chian Feng, an executive officer of NTHU student activity center, received the permission from the university authority to plan sport events for NTHU and NCTU students modeling after the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race.

While both side agreed on the plan to hold such an annual event, there was a disagreement on the naming of the Games. At last, Zhang Zhi-yi solved this problem by proposing the conventional coin tossing. &quot;If the head-side is up, the game would be called Mei-Chu; otherwise, the game would be called Chu-Mei.&quot; As the head-side of the coin went up, the tournament was thereby named Meichu to commemorate the two founding presidents of NTHU and NCTU, Mei Yi-chi and Ling Chu-Ming.

==Rankings==
NTHU is generally considered to be one of the best universities in Taiwan.

In 2021, Times Higher Education ranked National Tsing Hua University 351-400th in the world. The 2021 QS World University Rankings ranked National Tsing Hua University 168th overall. In 2021, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked National Tsing Hua University 363rd in the world. In 2020, Academic Ranking of World Universities ranked National Tsing Hua University 401-500th. 

In 2014, the representative of Japan in Taiwan listed NTHU as one of the seven well-known Taiwanese universities.

The 2020 QS World University Rankings by Subject ranked the university: 84th in Engineering &amp; Technology, 266th in Arts &amp; Humanities, 401-500th in Life Sciences &amp; Medicine, 101st in Natural Sciences, and 249th in Social Sciences &amp; Management

<text>Ü (lowercase ü) is a Latin script character composed of the letter [[U]] and the diaeresis diacritical mark. In some alphabets such as those of a number of Romance languages or Guarani it denotes an instance of regular U to be construed in isolation from adjacent characters with which it would usually form a larger unit; other alphabets like the Azerbaijani, Estonian, German, Hungarian and Turkish ones treat it as a letter in its own right. In those cases it typically represents a close front rounded vowel .

Although not a part of their alphabet, Ü also appears in languages such as Finnish and Swedish when retained in foreign proper names like &quot;München&quot; (&quot;Munich&quot;). A small number of Dutch and Afrikaans words employ the character to mark vowel hiatus (e.g. &quot;reünie&quot; /reːyˈni/ (&quot;reunion&quot;), a loanword marked with diaeresis to suppress the native reading of &quot;eu&quot; as a digraph pronounced /øː/).

== U-umlaut ==
A glyph, U with umlaut, appears in the German alphabet. It represents the umlauted form of &quot;u&quot;, which results in when long and when short. The letter is collated together with &quot;U&quot;, or as &quot;UE&quot;. In languages that have adopted German names or spellings, such as Swedish, the letter also occurs. It is however not a part of these languages&#x27; alphabets. In Swedish the letter is called &quot;tyskt y&quot; which means &quot;German y&quot;.

Though not a part of the Slovene alphabet, ü is often used in eastern Styrian dialects, especially around Ptuj as well as in the Resian dialect with the same pronouncation as in German.

In other languages that do not have the letter as part of the regular alphabet or in limited character sets such as ASCII, U-umlaut is frequently replaced with the two-letter combination &quot;ue&quot;. Software for optical character recognition sometimes sees it falsely as &quot;ii&quot;.

== Letter Ü ==

The letter Ü is present in the Hungarian, Turkish, Uyghur Latin, Estonian, Azeri, Turkmen, Crimean Tatar, Kazakh Latin and Tatar Latin alphabets, where it represents a close front rounded vowel . It is considered a distinct letter, collated separately, not a simple modification of U or Y, and is distinct from &quot;UE&quot;.

Wayuu represents the close central unrounded vowel using this letter.

In the Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and Finnish alphabets &quot;ü&quot; is alphabetized as &quot;y&quot;.

It is not present in the Basque alphabet but the Souletin dialect uses it for .

This same letter appears in the Chinese Romanisations Pinyin, Wade–Giles, and the German-based Lessing-Othmer, where it represents the same sound : 綠/lǜ (green) or 女/nǚ (female). Standard Mandarin Chinese pronunciation has both the sounds and . Pinyin only uses &quot;Ü&quot; to represent after the letters &quot;L&quot; or &quot;N&quot; to avoid confusion with words such as 路/lù (road) and 怒/nù (anger). Words such as 玉/yù (jade) or 句/jù (sentence) are pronounced with , but are not spelled with &quot;Ü&quot;, although Wade–Giles and Lessing use &quot;Ü&quot; in all situations. As the letter &quot;Ü&quot; is missing on most keyboards and the letter &quot;V&quot; is not present in standard Mandarin pinyin, the letter &quot;V&quot; is used on most computer Chinese input methods to enter the letter &quot;Ü&quot;. As a result, romanisation of Chinese with the letter &quot;V&quot; representing the Ü sound is sometimes found. However, Ü sound should be officially represented by &quot;yu&quot; in Pinyin when it is difficult to enter Ü. For example, the surname Lü (吕) would be written as &quot;Lyu&quot; in passports. Four extra tones for the letter &quot;ü&quot;, which are &quot;ǖ, ǘ, ǚ, ǜ&quot;, is added in Unicode as per GB/T 2312.

== U-diaeresis ==

Several languages use diaeresis over the letter U to show that the letter is pronounced in its regular way, without dropping out or building diphthongs with neighbouring letters.

In Catalan, &quot;ü&quot; is used in the letter combinations &quot;güe&quot;, &quot;güi&quot;, &quot;qüe&quot; and &quot;qüi&quot; to indicate the pronunciation , , or , respectively (e.g. , , , ); this contrasts with the combinations &quot;gue/gui/que/qui&quot;, in which the &quot;u&quot; is silent (, , , ). Catalan also uses the letter &quot;ü&quot; to indicate that a vowel pair that would normally form a diphthong must be pronounced as separate syllables (e.g. , ).

Similarly, in Spanish, &quot;ü&quot; is used in the combinations &quot;güe&quot; and &quot;güi&quot; , to distinguish them from &quot;gue&quot; and &quot;gui&quot; (e.g. , ). Unlike Catalan, though, Spanish does not use it after &quot;q&quot;, instead using &quot;cue&quot; and &quot;cui&quot; to spell words with or sounds (, ); it also does not use it to break diphthongs, sometimes using the letter &quot;ú&quot; for that purpose when necessary (, but ).

In French, the diaeresis appears over the &quot;u&quot; only very rarely, in some uncommon words, &quot;capharnaüm&quot; (&#x27;shambles&#x27;), &quot;Capharnaüm/Capernaüm&quot; or &quot;Emmaüs&quot; . After the 1990 spelling reforms, it is applied to a few more words, like &quot;aigüe&quot; (formerly &quot;aiguë), &quot;ambigüe&quot; (formerly &quot;ambiguë) and &quot;argüer&quot; (formerly without the diaeresis).

== Usage in phonetic alphabets ==
In the Rheinische Dokumenta, a phonetic alphabet for many West Central German, Low Rhenish, and related vernacular languages, &quot;ü&quot; represents a range from to .

== Typography ==

Historically the unique letter &quot;Ü&quot; and U-diaeresis were written as a &quot;U&quot; with two dots above the letter. 

U-umlaut was written as a &quot;U&quot; with a small &quot;e&quot; written above (Uͤ uͤ): this minute &quot;e&quot; degenerated to two vertical bars in medieval handwritings. In most later handwritings these bars in turn nearly became dots.

In modern typography there was insufficient space on typewriters and later computer keyboards to allow for both a U-with-dots (also representing &quot;Ü&quot;) and a U-with-bars. Since they looked near-identical the two glyphs were combined, which was also done in computer character encodings such as ISO 8859-1. As a result, there was no way to differentiate between the three different characters. While the distinction can be recreated in modern Unicode using combining diacritics, modern typographic standards do not recommend doing so. In the Hungarian alphabet, double acute U (Ű) is a distinct letter representing a long &quot;Ü&quot;.

<text>The Taiwan blue magpie (Urocissa caerulea), also called the Taiwan magpie, Formosan blue magpie (), or the &quot;long-tailed mountain lady&quot; (; Taiwanese Hokkien: Tn̂g-boé soaⁿ-niû), is a bird species in the crow family. It is endemic to Taiwan.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The Taiwan blue magpie was collected by Robert Swinhoe and described by John Gould. Swinhoe translated the magpie&#x27;s Hokkien name into English, calling it the &quot;Long-tailed Mountain-Nymph&quot;. The species is sometimes placed in the genus &quot;Cissa&quot;. It forms a superspecies with the yellow-billed blue magpie (&quot;Urocissa flavirostris&quot;) and the red-billed blue magpie (&quot;Urocissa erythroryncha&quot;). The species is monotypic.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Taiwan blue magpie is endemic to Taiwan. It lives in broadleaf forests at elevations of .

==Description==

It is in length. The tail measures around in length, and the wings are long. It weighs .

The plumages of the male and female are similar. The head, neck and breast are black. The eyes are yellow, and the bill and feet are red. The rest of the plumage is mostly blue. The wings and tail feathers have white tips. The underwing-coverts are dark grey, and the flight feathers are light grey. The uppertail-coverts have black tips. The central pair of tail feathers are the longest. The other tail feathers have black bands. Chicks are greyish, with a short tail and greyish-blue eyes.

==Behavior==
Taiwan blue magpies are not very afraid of people. They can be found near human residences in the mountains or newly cultivated lands. They are gregarious and are usually found in groups of three to twelve. The birds often fly in a line, following each other. This is sometimes called &quot;long-tailed formation&quot;.

Similar to other members of the crow family, they have a raucous call which is described as a high-pitched cackling chatter, &quot;kyak-kyak-kyak-kyak&quot;. Other calls include &quot;ga-kang, ga-kang&quot;, &quot;kwee-eep&quot; and &quot;gar-suee&quot;.

===Food and feeding===
Taiwan blue magpies are scavengers and omnivores. Their diet includes snakes, rodents, small insects, carrion, eggs and chicks of other birds, plants, fruits, and seeds. They also feed on food waste of humans. They sometimes store leftovers on the ground and cover them with leaves for future retrieval. Sometimes they store food in the leaves or branches.

===Breeding===
The breeding season is from March to July. The Taiwan blue magpie is monogamous. Females incubate eggs while males help with nest building and feeding. Their nests are built on high branches of trees. The nest is in the shape of a bowl and is made of twigs. Usually there are 3–8 eggs in a clutch. Eggs are light green in color, with brown marks. Hatching takes 17–19 days. There are 3–7 chicks per nest. Chicks leave the nest after 21–24 days, and can start flying for short distances after a few days. Some pairs breed a second time after this. The Taiwan blue magpie has helpers at the nest, mostly juveniles from previous breeding seasons. They help to feed the chicks and defend the nest. Taiwan blue magpies have a strong nest defence behaviour, and will attack intruders until they leave.

===Threats===
Taiwan blue magpies may be hit by cars or captured by humans. They are also killed by predators, such as the crested goshawk, white-bellied sea eagle, spot-bellied eagle owl and the Gurney&#x27;s eagle.

==Relationship with humans==
Taiwan blue magpie is the sacred bird of Taiwan aborigine Tsou, Thao, and Bunun peoples. The sacred bird is called in Tsou, in Thao, and (Isbukun group) / in Bunun. In the common great flood myths of Taiwan Austronesian peoples, in Tsou, Thao, and Bunun sagas, the last surviving peoples escaped from the great flood to high mountain summits as the last refuge. The sacred bird Taiwan blue magpie sacrificed itself and helped the peoples to carry the last fire tinder from Yu Shan summit back to the peoples. (in some versions of the sagas, the sacred bird is considered to be black bulbul).

Taiwan blue magpies have attacked humans to defend their nests. Taiwan blue magpies are sometimes illegally captured by humans, but the number of cases of this seems to have decreased.

In 2007, the Taiwan International Birding Associated held a vote to select the national bird of Taiwan. Participation was not limited to those in Taiwan, and there were over 1 million votes cast from 53 countries. The Taiwan blue magpie defeated the Mikado pheasant, but the vote was not formally accepted.

In 2017 China Airlines unveiled a Taiwan blue magpie paint scheme on an Airbus A350. The aircraft was the 100th A350 produced by Airbus.

The AIDC XAT-5 Blue Magpie advanced jet trainer is named after the Taiwan blue magpie.

==Status==
The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species has currently assessed the species to be of least concern as it does not meet the criteria to be vulnerable. The population trend is suspected to be stable. Due to its endemism, however, the Taiwan blue magpie has been listed as &quot;other conservation-deserving wildlife&quot; () and protected by Taiwan&#x27;s &quot;Wildlife Conservation Act&quot; ().

There is a small population of red-billed blue magpies that has been introduced to Wuling Farm in Taichung County (now part of Taichung City). In 2007, three hybrid chicks were found in a nest in Taichung, with red-billed and Taiwan magpie parents tending them. This caused some concern to conservationists, given the decline of the Taiwan hwamei due to the invasion of the Chinese hwamei. However, the Endemic Species Research Institute of Taiwan has been working to control red-billed magpie populations by capturing individual birds and relocating their nests.

<doc id="210952" wikidata="Q652479" url="?curid=210952" title="Metal umlaut">
<text>A metal umlaut (also known as röck döts) is a diacritic that is sometimes used gratuitously or decoratively over letters in the names of mainly hard rock or heavy metal bands—for example, those of Blue Öyster Cult, Queensrÿche, Motörhead, the Accüsed, Mötley Crüe, and the parody bands Spın̈al Tap and Green Jellÿ.

==Usage==
Among English speakers, the use of umlaut marks and other diacritics with a blackletter typeface is a form of foreign branding, which has been attributed to a desire for a &quot;gothic horror&quot; feel. The metal umlaut is not generally intended to affect the pronunciation of the band&#x27;s name, unlike the umlaut in German (where the letters &quot;u&quot; and &quot;ü&quot;, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;ä&quot;, as well as &quot;o&quot; and &quot;ö&quot;, represent distinct vowels) and the Scandinavian languages (where å/ä and a, ö/ø and o are distinct letters).

==History==
The first gratuitous use of the umlaut in the name of a hard rock or metal band appears to have been by Blue Öyster Cult in 1970. Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s website states it was added by guitarist and keyboardist Allen Lanier, but rock critic Richard Meltzer claims to have suggested it to their producer and manager Sandy Pearlman just after Pearlman came up with the name: &quot;I said, &#x27;How about an umlaut over the O?&#x27; Metal had a Wagnerian aspect anyway.&quot;

==Reactions==

Speakers of languages which use an umlaut to designate a pronunciation change may understand the intended effect, but perceive the result differently. When Mötley Crüe visited Germany, singer Vince Neil said the band couldn&#x27;t figure out why &quot;the crowds were chanting, &#x27;Mutley Cruh! Mutley Cruh!

These decorative umlauts have been parodied in film and fiction; in an interview about the mockumentary film &quot;This Is Spın̈al Tap&quot;, fictional rocker David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) says, &quot;It&#x27;s like a pair of eyes. You&#x27;re looking at the umlaut, and it&#x27;s looking at you.&quot; The heavy metal band Gwar parodied the use of metal umlauts in a lyric insert included with its first record, stylizing the song names with gratuitous diacritics. In 1997, the satirical newspaper &quot;The Onion&quot; published an article titled &quot;Ünited Stätes Toughens Image With Umlauts.&quot;

<text>Adolf Erik Ehrnrooth (9 February 1905 – 26 February 2004) was a Finnish general who served during the Winter and Continuation wars. He also competed in two equestrian events at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

==Early life==
Born in Helsinki, Ehrnrooth first went to Svenska normallyceum i Helsingfors and then entered cadet school in 1922 and served in the Uusimaa Dragoon Regiment (&quot;Uudenmaan Rakuunarykmentti&quot;). In 1958 he married a Danish countess Karin-Birgitte Schack who was a lady-in-waiting and a close friend of Queen Ingrid of Denmark. They had three children: Karin, Hans and Eva.

==Military career==
During the brief Winter War against the Soviet Union, he served on the staffs of the 7th Division and the Cavalry Brigade. When the Continuation War, also against the Soviet Union, broke out in June 1941, he served as the chief of staff of the 2nd Division until he was seriously wounded. After he recovered he was appointed to lead the 7th Infantry Regiment (JR 7) of the 2nd Division. During the battles on the Karelian Isthmus, he was awarded the Mannerheim cross. He also received the Grand Cross of the Royal Swedish Order of the Sword.

After the war, he led an active military career until he retired in 1965.

==Later life==
Adolf Ehrnrooth was the face and voice most associated with rehabilitation of the soldiers who secured Finland her independence. The long post-war era during which it simply was not progressive to value the military ended in the early 1990s, at which time his charismatic persona was at its height.
In his last statement he gave support to ProKarelia (Finnish NGO) and its plan for the Return of Ceded Territories. He said that he defended the borders of Finland declared in the Treaty of Tartu and considered them the only proper borders of Finland and that it was great injustice that the Soviet Union had taken these territories.

General Ehrnrooth died on 26 February 2004, and is buried in Hietaniemi cemetery, Helsinki. He was voted as the 4th greatest Finn of all time by the Finnish public during the Suuret suomalaiset (Great Finns) competition in 2004.

<text>Karbala is a city in central Iraq, located about southwest of Baghdad, and a few miles east of Lake Milh, also known as Razzaza Lake. Karbala is the capital of Karbala Governorate, and has an estimated population of 691,100 people (2024). 

The city, best known as the location of the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD, or for the shrines of Hussain and Abbas, is considered a holy city for Shia Muslims. Tens of millions of Shi&#x27;ite Muslims visit the site twice a year. The martyrdom of Husayn ibn &#x27;Ali and Abbas ibn &#x27;Ali 
is commemorated annually by near a hundred million of Shi&#x27;ites in the city.

Up to 34 million pilgrims visit the city to observe &quot;ʿĀshūrāʾ&quot; (the tenth day of Muharram), which marks the anniversary of Husayn&#x27;s death, but the main event is the &quot;Arbaʿeen&quot; (the 40th day after &#x27;Ashura&#x27;), where up to 40 million visit the graves. Most of the pilgrims travel on foot and come from all around Iraq and more than 56 countries.

==Etymology==

There are many opinions among different investigators, as to the origin of the word &quot;Karbala&quot;. Some have pointed out that &quot;Karbala&quot; has a connection to the &quot;Karbalato&quot; language, while others attempt to derive the meaning of word by analyzing its spelling and language. They conclude that it originates from the &quot;Kar Babel&quot; group of ancient Babylonian villages that included Nainawa, Al-Ghadiriyya, Karbella (or Karb Illu), Al-Nawaweess, and Al-Heer. This last name is today known as Al-Hair and is where Husayn ibn Ali&#x27;s grave is located.

The investigator Yaqut al-Hamawi had pointed out that the meaning of &quot;Karbala&quot; could have several explanations, one of which is that the place where Husayn ibn Ali was martyred is made of soft earth—.

According to Shia&#x27;s belief, the archangel Gabriel narrated the true meaning of the name &quot;Karbala&quot; to Muhammad: a combination of (, &quot;the land which will cause many agonies&quot;) and (, &quot;afflictions&quot;).

==History==

=== Religious significance ===

Mesopotamia has been mentioned in Quran. Some Shi&#x27;ites consider this verse of the Quran to refer to Iraq, the land of the Shi&#x27;ite sacred sites of Kufah, Najaf, Karbala, Kadhimiyyah and Samarra, since the Monotheistic preachers Ibrāhīm (Abraham) and Lūṭ (Lot), who are regarded as Prophets in Islam, are believed to have lived in the ancient Iraqi city of Kutha Rabba, before going to &quot;The Blessed Land&quot;.
Aside from the story of Abraham and Lot in Polytheistic Mesopotamia, there are passages in the Quran about Mount Judi, Babil (&quot;Babylon&quot;) and &quot;Qaryat Yunus&quot; (&quot;Town of Jonah&quot;).

The tomb of the martyred Imam has acquired great significance in Shia tradition because he and his fellow martyrs are seen as models of jihad in the way of God. Shi&#x27;ites believe that Karbala is one of the holiest places on Earth according to the following traditions (among others):

The angel Gabriel narrated to Muhammad that:

The fourth Shi&#x27;ite Imam, that is Zayn al-Abidin narrated:

In this regard, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq narrates, &#x27;Allah, the Almighty, has made the dust of my ancestor&#x27;s grave – Imam Husain (r.a) as a cure for every sickness and safety from every fear.&#x27; It is narrated from Ja&#x27;far that: &quot;The earth of the pure and holy grave of Husayn ibn ‘Ali (r.a) is a pure and blessed musk. For those who consume it, it is a cure for every ailment, and if our enemy uses it then he will melt the way fat melts, when you intend to consume that pure earth recite the following supplication&quot;

===Battle of Karbala===
The Battle of Karbala was fought on the bare deserts on the way to Kufa on October 10, 680 AD (10 Muharram 61 AH). Both Husayn ibn Ali and his brother Abbas ibn Ali were buried by the local Banī Asad tribe, at what later became known as the &quot;Mashhad Al-Husayn&quot;. The battle itself occurred as a result of Husain&#x27;s refusal of Yazid&#x27;s demand for allegiance to his caliphate. The Kufan governor, Ubaydallah ibn Ziyad, sent thirty thousand horsemen against Husayn as he traveled to Kufa. Husayn had no army, he was with his family and few friends who joined them, so there were around 73 men, including the 6-month-old Ali Asghar, son of Imam Husayn, in total. The horsemen, under &#x27;Umar ibn Sa&#x27;d, were ordered to deny Husayn and his followers water to force Husayn to agree to give an oath of allegiance. On the 9th of Muharram, Husayn refused, and requested to be given the night to pray. On the 10th day of Muharram, Husayn ibn Ali prayed the morning prayer and led his troops into battle along with his brother Abbas. Many of Husayn&#x27;s followers, including all of his present sons Ali Akbar, Ali Asghar (six months old) and his nephews Qassim, Aun and Muhammad were killed.

In 63 AH (683 AD), Yazid ibn Mu&#x27;awiya released the surviving members of Husayn&#x27;s family from prison as there was a threat of uprisings and some of the people in his court were unaware of who the battle was with, when they got to know that the descendants of Muhammad were killed, they were horrified. On their way to Mecca, they stopped at the site of the battle. There is a record of Sulayman ibn Surad going on pilgrimage to the site as early as 65 AH (685 AD). The city began as a tomb and shrine to Husayn ibn Ali, grandson of Muhammad and son of Ali ibn Abi Talib, and grew as a city to meet the needs of pilgrims. The city and tombs were greatly expanded by successive Muslim rulers, but suffered repeated destruction from attacking armies. The original shrine was destroyed by the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mutawakkil in 850 but was rebuilt in its present form around 979, only to be partly destroyed by fire in 1086 and rebuilt yet again.

===Early modern===
Like Najaf, the city suffered from severe water shortages that were only resolved in the early 18th century by building a dam at the head of the Husayniyya Canal. In 1737, the city replaced Isfahan in Iran as the main center of Shia scholarship. In the mid-eighteenth century it was dominated by the dean of scholarship, Yusuf Al Bahrani, a key proponent of the Akhbari tradition of Shia thought, until he died in 1772, after which the more state-centric Usuli school became more influential.

The Wahhabi sack of Karbala occurred on 21 April 1802 (1216 Hijri) (1801), under the rule of Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad the second ruler of the First Saudi State, when 12,000 Wahhabi Muslims from Najd attacked the city of Karbala. The attack was coincident with the anniversary of Ghadir Khum event, or 10 Muharram. This fight left 3,000–5,000 deaths and the dome of the tomb of Husayn ibn Ali, was destroyed. The fight lasted for 8 hours.

After the First Saudi State invasion, the city enjoyed semi-autonomy during Ottoman rule, governed by a group of gangs and mafia variously allied with members of the &#x27;ulama. In order to reassert their authority, the Ottoman army laid siege to the city. On January 13, 1843, Ottoman troops entered the city. Many of the city leaders fled leaving defense of the city largely to tradespeople. About 3,000 Arabs were killed in the city, and another 2,000 outside the walls (this represented about 15% of the city&#x27;s normal population). The Turks lost 400 men. This prompted many students and scholars to move to Najaf, which became the main Shia religious centre. Between 1850 and 1903, Karbala enjoyed a generous influx of money through the Oudh Bequest. The Shia-ruled Indian Province of Awadh, known by the British as Oudh, had always sent money and pilgrims to the holy city. The Oudh money, 10 million rupees, originated in 1825 from the Awadh Nawab Ghazi-ud-Din Haider. One third was to go to his wives, and the other two-thirds went to holy cities of Karbala and Najaf. When his wives died in 1850, the money piled up with interest in the hands of the British East India Company. The EIC sent the money to Karbala and Najaf per the wives&#x27; wishes, in the hopes of influencing the Ulama in Britain&#x27;s favor. This effort to curry favor is generally considered to have been a failure.

In 1915, Karbala was the scene of an uprising against the Ottoman Empire. In 1928, an important drainage project was carried out to relieve the city of unhealthy swamps, formed between Hussainiya and the Bani Hassan Canals on the Euphrates.

Defense of the City Hall in Karbala – a series of skirmishes fought from April 3 to April 6, 2004, between the Iraqi rebels of the Mahdi Army trying to conquer the city hall and the defending Polish and Bulgarian soldiers from the Multinational Division Central-South

In 2003 following the American invasion, the Karbala town council attempted to elect United States Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Lopez as mayor. Ostensibly so that his Marines, contractors, and funds could not leave.

On April 14, 2007, a car bomb exploded about from the shrine to Husayn, killing 47 and wounding over 150.

On January 19, 2008, 2 million Iraqi Shia pilgrims marched through Karbala city, Iraq to commemorate Ashura. 20,000 Iraqi troops and police guarded the event amid tensions due to clashes between Iraqi troops and Shia which left 263 people dead (in Basra and Nasiriya).

==Geography==
With an impressive 3.9 million palm trees, Karbala produces approximately 160,000 tons of dates across 90 different varieties. Karbala has surpassed Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Al-Ahsa Oasis, becoming the world&#x27;s largest palm oasis.

===Climate===

Karbala experiences a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot; in the Köppen climate classification) with extremely hot, long, dry summers and mild winters. Almost all of the yearly precipitation is received between November and April, though no month is wet.

== Economy ==
Karbala is a significant pilgrimage destination for Shia Muslims, especially during the Islamic holy month of Muharram. According to Azher Al-Kalash, Vice President of the Association of Hotels and Tourist Restaurants in Karbala, said, &quot;Karbala has the highest number of hotels in Iraq, with 900 hotels of various levels, equivalent to one-third of the total number of hotels in the entire country. Some hotels have safety and security concerns raised by the civil defense, but the most comply with the regulations and instructions.&quot;

Tourism in every country is influenced by supply and demand. Hence, hotel and transportation prices rise during peak times. In Karbala, the minimum hotel rate is around $10 per night, while the maximum can reach $50 during Ashura. However, the amount doubles during the Arbaeen pilgrimage due to the high demand. Arbaeen is the most significant pilgrimage that hotel owners rely on throughout the year.&quot; Thus, tourism plays an important role in stimulating various sectors, whether hotels, agriculture, trade, or others. It contributes to the employment of all economic sectors of society. 

Karbala Refinery, with a refining capacity of 140,000 barrels per day (bpd), it stands as Iraq&#x27;s largest refining project in four decades. The refinery commenced commercial operations in mid-March 2024, initially operating at 60% capacity, with plans to reach full capacity by August 2024. It is estimated that the refinery produce 70% of country&#x27;s petroleum products and generate $3bn in revenue.

==Culture==

===Religious tourism===
Karbala, alongside Najaf, is considered a thriving tourist destination for Shia Muslims and the tourism industry in the city boomed after the end of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s rule. Some religious tourism attractions include:

* Al Abbas Mosque

* Ruins of Mujada, about to the west of the city

Arbaeen is a massive annual pilgrimage event that takes place in Karbala. It is considered one of the largest peaceful gatherings in the world. In 2017, approximately 30 million people took part in the pilgrimage.

The official number of visitors during the 10-day period surpassed 22 million people on September 6, 2023, making it the largest and most peaceful gathering in the world. Shia Muslims largely attended the commemoration, as well as many Sunni Muslims and Christians who also visited to pay their respect to Imam Hussein.

Who Is Hussain, a charity is based in Karbala, has accumulated around 50,000 blood donations, saved more than 140,000 lives and helped feed more than 700,000 people. During the period of Arbaeen, its teams provide voluntary initiatives around the world like donating blood, alongside distributing food, drink and masks to citizens, to countries including the United States, France, Britain, Pakistan, Lebanon as well as African and poverty-driven countries.”

==Education==
===Universities===

University of Karbala, which was inaugurated on March 1, 2002, is one of the top most universities in Iraq regarding academic administration, human resources, and scientific research. Ahl al-Bayt University was founded in September 2003 by Dr. Mohsen Baqir Mohammed-Salih Al-Qazwini. The university has six major colleges: College of Law, Arts, Islamic Sciences, Medical &amp; Health Technology, Pharmacy and Dentistry.

Warith al-Anbiya University in Karbala, sponsored by the Imam Husayn Holy Shrine, was established in 2017. It has the faculties of engineering, administration, economics, law and pathology. It received its first batch of students in the academic year 2017–2018.

===Hawza Seminary===
The Hawza are Islamic education institutions that are administered under the guidance of a Grand Ayatollah or group of scholars to teach Shia Muslims and guide them through the rigorous journey of becoming an Alim (a religious scholar). Initially Karbala&#x27;s hawza consisted mostly of Iranians and Turkish scholars. The death of Sharif-ul-Ulama Mazandarani in 1830 as well as the repression of the Shia population by the Ottomans in 1843 both played a significant role in the relocation of many scholars to the city of Najaf and thus Najaf subsequently became the center of Shia Islamic leadership and education. Today the Hawza Seminary still exists in Karbala (such as the School of Allamah Bin Fahd) but to a lesser extent in comparison to Najaf.

==Infrastructure==

===Airports===
Airports in Karbala include:
*Karbala Northeast Airport

<doc id="210960" wikidata="Q749601" url="?curid=210960" title="Recoil">
<text>Recoil (often called knockback, kickback or simply kick) is the rearward thrust generated when a gun is being discharged. In technical terms, the recoil is a result of conservation of momentum, as according to Newton&#x27;s third law the force required to accelerate something will evoke an equal but opposite reactional force, which means the forward momentum gained by the projectile and exhaust gases (ejectae) will be mathematically balanced out by an equal and opposite momentum exerted back upon the gun.

== Basics ==
Any launching system (weapon or not) generates recoil. However recoil only constitutes a problem in the field of artillery and firearms due to the magnitude of the forces at play. Gun chamber pressures and projectile acceleration forces are tremendous, on the order of tens to hundreds megapascal and tens of thousands of times the acceleration of gravity (g&#x27;s), both necessary to launch the projectile at useful velocity during the very short time (typically only a few milliseconds) it is travelling inside the barrel. Meanwhile, the same pressures acting on the base of the projectile are acting on the rear face of the gun chamber, accelerating the gun rearward during firing with just the same force it is accelerating the projectile forward.

This moves the gun rearward and generates the recoil momentum. This recoil momentum is the product of the mass and the acceleration of the projectile and propellant gasses combined, reversed: the projectile moves forward, the recoil is rearward. The heavier and the faster the projectile, the more recoil will be generated. The gun acquires a rearward velocity that is ratio of this momentum by the mass of the gun: the heavier the gun, the slower the rearward velocity. 
As an example, a 8 g (124 gr) bullet of 9×19mm Parabellum flying forward at 350 m/s muzzle speed generates a momentum to push a 0.8 kg pistol firing it at 3.5 m/s rearward, if unopposed by the shooter.

=== Countering recoil ===
In order to bring the rearward moving gun to a halt, the momentum acquired by the gun is dissipated by a forward-acting counter-recoil force applied to the gun over a period of time during and after the projectile exits the muzzle. In hand-held small arms, the shooter will apply this force using their own body, resulting in a noticeable impulse commonly referred to as a &quot;kick&quot;. In heavier mounted guns, such as heavy machine guns or artillery pieces, recoil momentum is transferred through the platform on which the weapon is mounted. Practical weight gun mounts are typically not strong enough to withstand the maximum forces accelerating the gun during the short time the projectile is in the barrel. To mitigate these large recoil forces, recoil buffering mechanisms spread out the counter-recoiling force over a longer time, typically ten to a hundred times longer than the duration of the forces accelerating the projectile. This results in the required counter-recoiling force being proportionally lower, and easily absorbed by the gun mount.

To apply this counter-recoiling force, modern mounted guns may employ recoil buffering comprising springs and hydraulic recoil mechanisms, similar to shock-absorbing suspension on automobiles. Early cannons used systems of ropes along with rolling or sliding friction to provide forces to slow the recoiling cannon to a stop. Recoil buffering allows the maximum counter-recoil force to be lowered so that strength limitations of the gun mount are not exceeded.

==== Contribution of propellant gasses ====
Modern cannons also employ muzzle brakes very effectively to redirect some of the propellant gasses rearward after projectile exit. This provides a counter-recoiling force to the barrel, allowing the buffering system and gun mount to be more efficiently designed at even lower weight.

Propellant gases are even more tapped in recoilless guns, where much of the high pressure gas remaining in the barrel after projectile exit is vented rearward though a nozzle at the back of the chamber, creating a large counter-recoiling force sufficient to eliminate the need for heavy recoil mitigating buffers on the mount (although at the cost of a reduced muzzle velocity of the projectile).

==== Hand-held guns ====

The same physics principles affecting recoil in mounted guns also applies to hand-held guns. However, the shooter&#x27;s body assumes the role of gun mount, and must similarly dissipate the gun&#x27;s recoiling momentum over a longer period of time than the bullet travel-time in the barrel, in order not to injure the shooter. Hands, arms and shoulders have considerable strength and elasticity for this purpose, up to certain practical limits. Nevertheless, &quot;perceived&quot; recoil limits vary from shooter to shooter, depending on body size, the use of recoil padding, individual pain tolerance, the weight of the firearm, and whether recoil buffering systems and muzzle devices (muzzle brake or suppressor) are employed. For this reason, establishing recoil safety standards for small arms remains challenging, in spite of the straightforward physics involved.

== Physics: momentum, energy and impulse ==

There are two conservation laws at work when a gun is fired: conservation of momentum and conservation of energy. Recoil is explained by the law of conservation of momentum, and so it is easier to discuss it separately from energy.

Momentum is simply mass multiplied by velocity. Velocity is speed &quot;in a particular direction&quot; (not just speed). In a very technical sense, speed is a scalar (mathematics): a magnitude; while velocity is a vector (physics): magnitude and direction. Momentum is conservative: any change in momentum of an object requires an equal and opposite change of some other objects. Hence the recoil: imparting momentum to the projectile requires imparting opposite momentum to the gun.

A change in momentum of a mass requires applying a force (this is Newton&#x27;s laws of motion). In a firearm forces wildly change, so what matters is impulse: the change of momentum is equal to the impulse. The rapid change of velocity (acceleration) of the gun is a shock and will countered as if by a shock absorber.

Energy in firing a firearm comes in many forms (thermal, pressure) but for understanding recoil what matters is kinetic energy, which is half mass multiplied by squared speed. For the recoiling gun, this means that for a given rearward momentum, doubling the mass halves the speed and also halves the kinetic energy of the gun, making it easier to dissipate.

=== Momentum ===
If all the masses and velocities involved are accounted for, the vector sum, magnitude and direction, of the momentum of all the bodies involved does not change; that is, momentum of the system is conserved. This conservation of momentum is why gun recoil occurs in the opposite direction of bullet projection—the mass times velocity of the projectile (gas included) in the positive direction equals the mass times velocity of the gun in the negative direction. In summation, the total momentum of the system (ammunition, gun and shooter/shooting platform)) equals zero just as it did before the trigger was pulled.

From a practical engineering perspective, therefore, through the mathematical application of conservation of momentum, it is possible to calculate a first approximation of a gun&#x27;s recoil momentum and kinetic energy simply based on estimates of the projectile speed (and mass) coming out the barrel. And then to properly design recoil buffering systems to safely dissipate that momentum and energy. To confirm analytical calculations and estimates, once a prototype gun is manufactured, the projectile and gun recoil energy and momentum can be directly measured using a ballistic pendulum and ballistic chronograph.

The nature of the recoil process is determined by the force of the expanding gases in the barrel upon the gun (recoil force), which is equal and opposite to the force upon the ejecta. It is also determined by the counter-recoil force applied to the gun (e.g. an operator&#x27;s hand or shoulder, or a mount). The recoil force only acts during the time that the ejecta are still in the barrel of the gun. The counter-recoil force is generally applied over a longer time period and adds forward momentum to the gun equal to the backward momentum supplied by the recoil force, in order to bring the gun to a halt. There are two special cases of counter recoil force: Free-recoil, in which the time duration of the counter-recoil force is very much larger than the duration of the recoil force, and zero-recoil, in which the counter-recoil force matches the recoil force in magnitude and duration. Except for the case of zero-recoil, the counter-recoil force is smaller than the recoil force but lasts for a longer time. Since the recoil force and the counter-recoil force are not matched, the gun will move rearward, slowing down until it comes to rest. In the zero-recoil case, the two forces are matched and the gun will not move when fired. In most cases, a gun is very close to a free-recoil condition, since the recoil process generally lasts much longer than the time needed to move the ejecta down the barrel. An example of near zero-recoil would be a gun securely clamped to a massive or well-anchored table, or supported from behind by a massive wall. However, employing zero-recoil systems is often neither practical nor safe for the structure of the gun, as the recoil momentum must be absorbed directly through the very small distance of elastic deformation of the materials the gun and mount are made from, perhaps exceeding their strength limits. For example, placing the butt of a large caliber gun directly against a wall and pulling the trigger risks cracking both the gun stock and the surface of the wall.

The recoil of a firearm, whether large or small, is a result of the law of conservation of momentum. Assuming that the firearm and projectile are both at rest before firing, then their total momentum is zero. Assuming a near free-recoil condition, and neglecting the gases ejected from the barrel, (an acceptable first estimate), then immediately after firing, conservation of momentum requires that the total momentum of the firearm and projectile is the same as before, namely zero. Stating this mathematically:
formula_1
where formula_2 is the momentum of the firearm and formula_3 is the momentum of the projectile. In other words, immediately after firing, the momentum of the firearm is equal and opposite to the momentum of the projectile.

Since momentum of a body is defined as its mass multiplied by its velocity, we can rewrite the above equation as:
formula_4
where:
*formula_5 is the mass of the firearm
*formula_6 is the velocity of the firearm immediately after firing
*formula_7 is the mass of the projectile
*formula_8 is the velocity of the projectile immediately after firing

A force integrated over the time period during which it acts will yield the momentum supplied by that force. The counter-recoil force must supply enough momentum to the firearm to bring it to a halt. This means that:

formula_9

where:
*formula_10 is the counter-recoil force as a function of time ()
*formula_11 is duration of the counter-recoil force

A similar equation can be written for the recoil force on the firearm:

formula_12

where:
*formula_13 is the recoil force as a function of time ()
*formula_14 is duration of the recoil force

Assuming the forces are somewhat evenly spread out over their respective durations, the condition for free-recoil is formula_15, while for zero-recoil, 

=== Angular momentum ===
For a gun firing under free-recoil conditions, the force on the gun may not only force the gun backwards, but may also cause it to rotate about its center of mass or recoil mount. This is particularly true of older firearms, such as the classic Kentucky rifle, where the butt stock angles down significantly lower than the barrel, providing a pivot point about which the muzzle may rise during recoil. Modern firearms, such as the M16 rifle, employ stock designs that are in direct line with the barrel, in order to minimize any rotational effects. If there is an angle for the recoil parts to rotate about, the torque (formula_16) on the gun is given by:

formula_17

where formula_18 is the perpendicular distance of the center of mass of the gun below the barrel axis, formula_19 is the force on the gun due to the expanding gases, equal and opposite to the force on the bullet, formula_20 is the moment of inertia of the gun about its center of mass, or its pivot point, and formula_21 is the angle of rotation of the barrel axis &quot;up&quot; from its orientation at ignition (aim angle). The angular momentum of the gun is found by integrating this equation to obtain:
formula_22
where the equality of the momenta of the gun and bullet have been used. The angular rotation of the gun as the bullet exits the barrel is then found by integrating again:
formula_23

where formula_24 is the angle above the aim angle at which the bullet leaves the barrel, formula_25 is the time of travel of the bullet in the barrel (because of the acceleration formula_26 the time is longer than formula_27 : formula_28) and is the distance the bullet travels from its rest position to the tip of the barrel. The angle at which the bullet leaves the barrel above the aim angle is then given by:
formula_29

=== Including the ejected gas ===
Before the projectile leaves the gun barrel, it obturates the bore and &quot;plugs up&quot; the expanding gas generated by the propellant combustion behind it. This means the gas is essentially contained within a closed system and acts as a neutral element in the overall momentum of the system&#x27;s physics. However, when the projectile exits the barrel, this functional seal is removed and the highly energetic bore gas is suddenly free to exit the muzzle and expand in the form of a supersonic shockwave (which can be often fast enough to momentarily overtake the projectile and affect its flight dynamics), creating a phenomenon known as the muzzle blast. The forward vector of this blast creates a jet propulsion effect that exerts back upon the barrel, and creates an additional momentum on top of the backward momentum generated by the projectile before it exits the gun.

The overall recoil applied to the firearm is equal and opposite to the total forward momentum of not only the projectile, but also the ejected gas. Likewise, the recoil energy given to the firearm is affected by the ejected gas. By conservation of mass, the mass of the ejected gas will be equal to the original mass of the propellant (assuming complete burning). As a rough approximation, the ejected gas can be considered to have an effective exit velocity of formula_30 where formula_31 is the muzzle velocity of the projectile and formula_32 is approximately constant. The total momentum formula_33 of the propellant and projectile will then be:
formula_34
where formula_35 is the mass of the propellant charge, equal to the mass of the ejected gas.

This expression should be substituted into the expression for projectile momentum in order to obtain a more accurate description of the recoil process. The effective velocity may be used in the energy equation as well, but since the value of α used is generally specified for the momentum equation, the energy values obtained may be less accurate. The value of the constant α is generally taken to lie between 1.25 and 1.75. It is mostly dependent upon the type of propellant used, but may depend slightly on other things such as the ratio of the length of the barrel to its radius.

Muzzle devices can reduce the recoil impulse by altering the pattern of gas expansion. For instance, muzzle brakes primarily works by diverting some of the gas ejecta towards the sides, increasing the lateral blast intensity (hence louder to the sides) but reducing the thrust from the forward-projection (thus less recoil). Similarly, recoil compensators divert the gas ejecta mostly upwards to counteract the muzzle rise. However, suppressors work on a different principle, not by vectoring the gas expansion laterally but instead by modulating the forward speed of the gas expansion. By using internal baffles, the gas is made to travel through a convoluted path before eventually released outside at the front of the suppressor, thus dissipating its energy over a larger area and a longer time. This reduces both the intensity of the blast (thus lower loudness) and the recoil generated (as for the same impulse, force is inversely proportional to time).

== Perception of recoil ==
For small arms, the way in which the shooter perceives the recoil, or &quot;kick&quot;, can have a significant impact on the shooter&#x27;s experience and performance. For example, a gun that is said to &quot;kick like a mule&quot; is going to be approached with trepidation, and the shooter may anticipate the recoil and flinch in anticipation as the shot is released. This leads to the shooter jerking the trigger, rather than pulling it smoothly, and the jerking motion is almost certain to disturb the alignment of the gun and may result in a miss. The shooter may also be physically injured by firing a weapon generating recoil in excess of what the body can safely absorb or restrain; perhaps getting hit in the eye by the rifle scope, hit in the forehead by a handgun as the elbow bends under the force, or soft tissue damage to the shoulder, wrist and hand; and these results vary for individuals. In addition, as pictured in the image, excessive recoil can create serious range safety concerns, if the shooter cannot adequately restrain the firearm in a down-range direction.

Perception of recoil is related to the deceleration the body provides against a recoiling gun, deceleration being a force that slows the velocity of the recoiling mass. Force applied over a distance is energy. The force that the body feels, therefore, is dissipating the kinetic energy of the recoiling gun mass. A heavier gun, that is a gun with more mass, will manifest lower recoil kinetic energy, and, generally, result in a lessened perception of recoil. Therefore, although determining the recoiling energy that must be dissipated through a counter-recoiling force is arrived at by conservation of momentum, kinetic energy of recoil is what is actually being restrained and dissipated. The ballistics analyst discovers this recoil kinetic energy through analysis of projectile momentum.

One of the common ways of describing the felt recoil of a particular gun-cartridge combination is as &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;sharp&quot; recoiling; soft recoil is recoil spread over a longer period of time, that is at a lower deceleration, and sharp recoil is spread over a shorter period of time, that is with a higher deceleration. Like pushing softer or harder on the brakes of a car, the driver feels less or more deceleration force being applied, over a longer or shorter distance to bring the car to a stop. However, for the human body to mechanically adjust recoil time, and hence length, to lessen felt recoil force is perhaps an impossible task. Other than employing less safe and less accurate practices, such as shooting from the hip, shoulder padding is a safe and effective mechanism that allows sharp recoiling to be lengthened into soft recoiling, as lower decelerating force is transmitted into the body over a slightly greater distance and time, and spread out over a slightly larger surface.

Keeping the above in mind, one can generally base the relative recoil of firearms by factoring in a small number of parameters: bullet momentum and the mass of the firearm. Lowering momentum lowers recoil, all else being the same. Increasing the firearm&#x27;s mass also lowers recoil, again all else being the same.

In addition to the overall mass of the gun, reciprocating parts of the gun will affect how the shooter perceives recoil. While these parts are not part of the ejecta, and do not alter the overall momentum of the system, they do involve moving masses during the operation of firing. For example, gas-operated shotguns are widely held to have a &quot;softer&quot; recoil than fixed breech or recoil-operated guns (although many semi-automatic recoil and gas-operated guns incorporate recoil buffer systems into the stock that effectively spread out peak felt recoil forces.) In a gas-operated gun, the bolt is accelerated rearwards by propellant gases during firing, which results in a forward force on the body of the gun. This is countered by a rearward force as the bolt reaches the limit of travel and moves forwards, resulting in a zero sum, but to the shooter, the recoil has been spread out over a longer period of time, resulting in the &quot;softer&quot; feel.

== Mounted guns ==


A recoil system absorbs recoil energy, reducing the peak force that is conveyed to whatever the gun is mounted on. Old-fashioned cannons without a recoil system roll several meters backwards when fired; systems were used to somewhat limit this movement (ropes, friction including brakes on wheels, slopes so that the recoil would force the gun uphill...), but utterly preventing any movement would just have resulted in the mount breaking. As a result, guns had to be put back into firing position and carefully aimed again after each shot, dramatically slowing the firing rate. The modern quick-firing guns was made possible by the invention of a much more efficient device: the hydro-pneumatic recoil system. First developed by Wladimir Baranovsky in 1872–5 and adopted by the Russian army, then later in France, in the 75mm field gun of 1897, it is still the main device used by big guns nowadays.

In this system, the barrel is mounted on rails on which it can recoil to the rear, and the recoil is taken up by a cylinder which is similar in operation to an automotive gas-charged shock absorber, and is commonly visible as a cylinder shorter and smaller than the barrel mounted parallel to it. The cylinder contains a charge of compressed air that will act as a spring, as well as hydraulic oil; in operation, the barrel&#x27;s energy is taken up in compressing the air as the barrel recoils backward, then is dissipated via hydraulic damping as the barrel is returned forward to the firing position under the pressure of the compressed air. The recoil impulse is thus spread out over the time in which the barrel is compressing the air, rather than over the much narrower interval of time when the projectile is being fired. This greatly reduces the peak force conveyed to the mount (or to the ground on which the gun has been placed).

=== Soft-recoil ===
In a &quot;soft-recoil system&quot;, the spring (or air cylinder) that returns the barrel to the forward position starts out in a nearly fully compressed state, then the gun&#x27;s barrel is released free to fly forward in the moment before firing; the charge is then ignited just as the barrel reaches the fully forward position. Since the barrel is still moving forward when the charge is ignited, about half of the recoil impulse is applied to stopping the forward motion of the barrel, while the other half is, as in the usual system, taken up in recompressing the spring. A latch then catches the barrel and holds it in the starting position. This roughly halves the energy that the spring needs to absorb, and also roughly halves the peak force conveyed to the mount, as compared to the usual system. However, the need to reliably achieve ignition at a single precise instant is a major practical difficulty with this system; and unlike the usual hydro-pneumatic system, soft-recoil systems do not easily deal with hangfires or s. One of the early guns to use this system was the French 65 mm mle.1906; it was also used by the World War II British PIAT man-portable anti-tank weapon.

=== Other devices ===

Recoilless rifles and rocket launchers exhaust gas to the rear, balancing the recoil. They are used often as light anti-tank weapons. The Swedish-made Carl Gustav 84mm recoilless gun is such a weapon.

In machine guns following Hiram Maxim&#x27;s design – e.g. the Vickers machine gun – the recoil of the barrel is used to drive the feed mechanism.

<doc id="210968" wikidata="Q310035" url="?curid=210968" title="Charles George Gordon">
<text>Major-General Charles George Gordon CB (28 January 1833 – 26 January 1885), also known as Chinese Gordon, Gordon Pasha, and Gordon of Khartoum, was a British Army officer and administrator. He saw action in the Crimean War as an officer in the British Army. However, he made his military reputation in China, where he was placed in command of the &quot;Ever Victorious Army&quot;, a force of Chinese soldiers led by European officers which was instrumental in putting down the Taiping Rebellion, regularly defeating much larger forces. For these accomplishments, he was given the nickname &quot;Chinese Gordon&quot; and honours from both the Emperor of China and the British.

He entered the service of the Khedive of Egypt in 1873 (with British government approval) and later became the Governor-General of the Sudan, where he did much to suppress revolts and the local slave trade. He then resigned and returned to Europe in 1880.

A serious revolt then broke out in the Sudan, led by a Muslim religious leader and self-proclaimed Mahdi, Muhammad Ahmad. In early 1884, Gordon was sent to Khartoum with instructions to secure the evacuation of loyal soldiers and civilians and to depart with them. In defiance of those instructions, after evacuating about 2,500 civilians, he retained a smaller group of soldiers and non-military men. In the months before the fall of Khartoum, Gordon and the Mahdi corresponded; Gordon offered him the sultanate of Kordofan and the Mahdi requested Gordon to convert to Islam and join him, which Gordon declined. Besieged by the Mahdi&#x27;s forces, Gordon organised a citywide defence that lasted for almost a year and gained him the admiration of the British public, but not of the government, which had wished him not to become entrenched there. Only when public pressure to act had become irresistible did the government, with reluctance, send a relief force. It arrived two days after the city had fallen and Gordon had been killed.

==Early life==
Gordon was born in Woolwich, Kent, a son of Major General Henry William Gordon (1786–1865) and Elizabeth (1792–1873), daughter of Samuel Enderby Junior. The men of the Gordon family had served as officers in the British Army for four generations, and as a son of a general, Gordon was raised to be the fifth generation; the possibility that Gordon would pursue anything other than a military career seems never to have been considered by his parents. All of Gordon&#x27;s brothers also became Army officers.

Gordon grew up in England, Ireland, Scotland, and the Ionian Islands (which were under British rule until 1864) as his father was moved from post to post. He was educated at Fullands School in Taunton, Taunton School, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.

In 1843, Gordon was devastated when his favourite sibling, his sister Emily, died of tuberculosis, writing years later, &quot;humanly speaking it changed my life, it was never the same since&quot;. After her death, her place as Gordon&#x27;s favourite sibling was taken by his very religious older sister Augusta, who nudged her brother towards religion.

As a teenager and an army officer cadet, Gordon was known for his high spirits, a combative streak, and tendency to disregard authority and the rules if he felt them to be stupid or unjust, a personality trait that held back his graduation by two years when teachers decided to punish him for flouting the rules.

As a cadet, Gordon displayed exceptional talents at map-making and in designing fortifications, which led to his career choice of the Royal Engineers or &quot;sappers&quot; in the Army. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 23 June 1852, completing his training at Chatham, and he was promoted to full lieutenant on 17 February 1854. The sappers were an elite corps who performed reconnaissance work, led storming parties, demolished obstacles in assaults, and undertook rear-guard actions in retreats and other hazardous tasks.

As an officer, Gordon showed strong charisma and leadership, but his superiors distrusted him on account of his tendency to disobey orders if he felt them to be wrong or unjust. A man of medium stature, with striking blue eyes, the charismatic Gordon had the ability to inspire men to follow him anywhere.

Gordon was first assigned to construct fortifications at Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, Wales. During his time in Milford Haven, Gordon was befriended by a young couple, Francis and Anne Drew, who introduced him to evangelical Protestantism. Gordon was especially impressed with Philippians 1:21 where St. Paul wrote: &quot;For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain&quot;, a passage he underlined in his Bible and often quoted. He attended diverse congregations, including Roman Catholic, Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist. Gordon, who once said to a Roman Catholic priest that &quot;the church is like the British Army, one army but many regiments&quot;, never aligned himself with or became a member of any church.

==From Crimea to the Danube==
When the Crimean War began, Gordon was assigned to his boyhood home of Corfu, but after several letters to the War Office, he was sent to Crimea instead. He was sent to the Russian Empire, arriving at Balaklava in January 1855. He first displayed his death wish as he wrote at the time that he had gone &quot;to the Crimea, hoping, without having a hand in it, to be killed&quot;.

In the 19th century, Russia was Britain&#x27;s archenemy, with many people in both nations seeing an ideological conflict between Russian autocracy and British democracy, and Gordon was anxious to fight in the Crimea. He was put to work in the Siege of Sevastopol and took part in the assault of the Redan from 18 June to 8 September. As a sapper, Gordon had to map out the Russian fortifications at the city-fortress of Sevastopol, designed by the famous Russian military engineer, Eduard Totleben. It was a highly dangerous job that frequently put him under enemy fire, and led to him being wounded for the first time when a Russian sniper put a bullet into him. Gordon spent much time in &quot;the Quarries&quot;, as the British called their section of the trenches, facing Sevastopol.

During his time in Crimea, Gordon made friendships that were to last for the rest of his life, most notably with Romolo Gessi, Garnet Wolseley, and Gerald Graham, all of whom would cross paths with Gordon several times in the future.

On 18 June 1855, the besieging British and French armies began what was intended to be the final assault that would take Sevastopol, which began with a huge bombardment. As a sapper, Gordon was in a front line trench where he was under intense fire, men fell all around him, and he was forced to take cover so often that he was covered literally from head to toe with mud and blood. Despite the best efforts of the Allies, the French failed to take the Malakhov fortress, while the British failed to take the Redan fortress on 18 June. The casualties on the Allied side were quite high that day.

Gordon spent thirty-four consecutive days in the trenches around Sevastopol, and earned a reputation as an able and brave young officer. It was said at the British HQ that, &quot;If you want to know what the Russians are up to, send for Charlie Gordon.&quot;

Gordon took part in the expedition to Kinburn, and returned to Sevastopol at the war&#x27;s end. During the Crimean war, Gordon picked up an addiction to Turkish cigarettes which was to last for his rest of his life, and many commented that smoking was Gordon&#x27;s most conspicuous vice as he always seemed to have a cigarette at his lips.

For his services in Crimea, he received the Crimean war medal and clasp. For the same services, he was appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour by the Government of France on 16 July 1856.

Following the peace, he was attached to an international commission to mark the new border between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire in Bessarabia. When Gordon first arrived in the city of Galatz (modern Galați, Romania) in the Ottoman protectorate of Moldavia, he called the city &quot;very dusty and not desirable at all as a place of residence&quot;. As he travelled to Bessarabia, he commented in his letters home about the richness and fertility of the Romanian countryside, which produced delicious fruits and vegetables in great abundance, and the poverty of the Romanian peasants.

After a visit to Jassy (modern Iași), Gordon wrote: &quot;The &quot;boyers&quot; live most of their lives in Paris and society is quite French... The prince keeps a great state, and I was introduced to him with much ceremony. The English uniform produces an immediate sensation&quot;. Gordon did not speak Romanian, but his fluency in French allowed him to socialise with the Francophile Romanian elite, who were all fluent in French. As the maps that delineated the Russian-Ottoman frontier were all old and inaccurate, Gordon spent much time clashing with his Russian counterparts about where precisely the frontier was and soon discovered that the Russians were very keen to have the frontier on the Danube, which Gordon had orders from London to prevent. Gordon called the Romanians the &quot;most fickle and intriguing people on the earth. They ape the French in everything and are full of ceremony, dress, etc... The employees sent by the Moldovan government to take over the ceded territory have been receiving bribes and trafficking in the most disgraceful manner.&quot;

Afterwards, Gordon was sent to delineate the frontier between Ottoman Armenia and Russian Armenia, the highlight of which was tobogganing down Mount Ararat. Gordon continued surveying, marking off the boundary into Asia Minor. During his time in Anatolia, Gordon embraced the new technology of the camera to take what the Canadian historian C. Brad Faught called a series of &quot;evocative photographs&quot; of the people and landscape of Armenia. Throughout his life, Gordon was always a keen amateur photographer and was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society to honour him for his Armenian photographs. Gordon returned to Britain in late 1858, and was appointed as an instructor at Chatham. He was promoted to captain on 1 April 1859.

==China==
===Arrival in China===

Gordon was bored with garrison duty in Chatham and often wrote to the War Office, begging them to send him anywhere in the world where British arms were seeing action. In 1860, Gordon volunteered to serve in China, in the Second Opium War. When Gordon arrived at Hong Kong, he was disappointed to learn he was &quot;just too late for the fighting&quot;. Gordon had heard of the Taiping Rebellion long before he had set sail for China, and he was at first sympathetic towards the Taipings, led by Hong Xiuquan, who proclaimed himself to be the younger brother of Jesus Christ, viewing them as somewhat eccentric Christians.

After stopping in Shanghai, Gordon visited the Chinese countryside and was appalled at the atrocities committed by the Taipings against the local peasants, writing to his family he would love to smash this &quot;cruel&quot; army with its &quot;desolating presence&quot; that killed without mercy. He arrived at Tianjin in September 1860. He was present during the capture of Peking and at the destruction of the Summer Palace. Gordon agreed with Lord Elgin that after the Chinese authorities had murdered a group of British and French officers travelling under a white flag to parley that a reprisal was in order, but called the burning of the Summer Palace &quot;vandal-like&quot; and informed his sister in a letter that &quot;it made one&#x27;s heart sore&quot; to burn it. The Anglo-French force remained in northern China until April 1862, then, under General Charles William Dunbar Staveley, withdrew to Shanghai to protect the European settlement from the rebel Taiping army.

Following the successes in the 1850s in the provinces of Guangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, and the capture of Nanjing in 1853, the rebel advance had slowed. For some years, the Taipings gradually advanced eastwards, but eventually they came close enough to Shanghai to alarm the European inhabitants. A militia of Europeans and Asians was raised for the defence of the city and placed under the command of an American, Frederick Townsend Ward, and occupied the country to the west of Shanghai. The British arrived at a crucial time. Staveley decided to clear the rebels within of Shanghai in co-operation with Ward and a small French force. Gordon was attached to his staff as engineer officer. Jiading, northwest suburb of present Shanghai, Qingpu, and other towns were occupied, and the area was fairly cleared of rebels by the end of 1862.

Ward was killed in the Battle of Cixi and his successor H. A. Burgevine, an American, was disliked by the Imperial Chinese authorities. Burgevine was an unsavory character known for his greed and alcoholism. Moreover, Burgevine made little effort to hide his racism, and his relations with the Chinese were very difficult at the best of times. Li Hongzhang, the governor of the Jiangsu province, requested Staveley to appoint a British officer to command the contingent. Staveley selected Gordon, who had been made a brevet major in December 1862 and the nomination was approved by the British government. Given Burgevine&#x27;s alcoholism, open corruption, and tendency to engage in acts of mindless violence when drunk, the Chinese wanted &quot;a man of good temper, of clean hands, and a steady economist&quot; as his replacement. These requirements led Staveley to choose Gordon. Li was impressed with Gordon, writing:It is a direct blessing from Heaven, the coming of this British Gordon. ... He is superior in manner and bearing to any of the foreigners whom I have come into contact with, and does not show outwardly that conceit which makes most of them repugnant in my sight...What an elixir for a heavy heart-to see this splendid Englishman fight! ... If there is anything that I admire nearly as much as the superb scholarship of Zeng Guofan, it is the military qualities of this fine officer. He is a glorious fellow!...With his many faults, his pride, his temper, and his never-ending demand for money—but he is a noble man, and in spite of all I have said to him or about him, I will ever think most highly of him. ... He is an honest man, but difficult to get on with. Gordon was honest and incorruptible, and unlike many Chinese officers, did not steal the money that was meant to pay his men, but rather insisted on paying the Ever Victorious Army on time and in full. Gordon&#x27;s insistence on paying his men meant that he was always pressing the Imperial government for money, something which often irritated the mandarins who did not understand why Gordon did not just let his men loot and plunder as a compensation for wages. Gordon designed the uniform for the Ever Victorious Army, which consisted of black boots together with turbans, jackets, and trousers that were all green, while his personal bodyguard of 300 men wore blue uniforms.

===Command of the Ever Victorious Army===
In March 1863, Gordon took command of the force at Songjiang, which had received the name of &quot;Ever Victorious Army&quot;. Without waiting to reorganise his troops, Gordon led them at once to the relief of Changsu, a town 40 miles northwest of Shanghai. The relief was successfully accomplished and Gordon quickly won the respect of his troops. Gordon made a point of treating POWs well to encourage the Taipings to surrender, and many of his men were former Taipings who chose to enlist in the Ever Victorious Army. Unlike Ward and Burgevine, Gordon realised that the network of canals and rivers that divided the Chinese countryside were not obstacles blocking an advance, but were rather &quot;arteries&quot; for allowing an advance as Gordon decided to move his men and supplies via the waterways.

Gordon&#x27;s task was made easier by innovative military ideas Ward had implemented in the Ever Victorious Army. Gordon was quite critical of the way Chinese generals fought the war, observing that the Chinese were willing to inflict and accept gargantuan losses in battle, an approach Gordon disapproved of. Gordon wrote: &quot;The great thing...is to cut off their retreat, and the chances are they will go without trouble; but attack them in the front, and leave their rear open, and they fight most desperately&quot;. Gordon always preferred to outflank the Taiping lines rather than to take them on frontally, an approach that caused much tension with his counterparts in the Chinese Imperial Army who did not share Gordon&#x27;s horror at the huge numbers of casualties caused by frontal assaults.

On the morning of 30 May 1863, the Taiping forces guarding the town of Quinsan were astonished to see an armoured paddle steamer, the &quot;Hyson,&quot; armed with a 32-pounder cannon on the bow, sailing up a canal, at whose prow stood Gordon. Following the &quot;Hyson&quot; was a fleet of 80 junks converted to gunboats. Aboard the &quot;Hyson&quot; were 350 men from the elite 4th Regiment of the Ever Victorious Army. Under fire from the Taiping forces, Gordon&#x27;s men chopped up the wooden stakes the Taipings had placed in the canal, thereby allowing Gordon to outflank the main Taiping defence line and to enter the main canal connecting Quinsan to Suzhou.

Gordon&#x27;s breakthrough caught the rebel army off guard and caused thousands of the enemy to panic and flee. Gordon disembarked the 4th Regiment with orders to take Quinsan while he sailed up and down the main canal in the &quot;Hyson&quot;, using the 32-pounder gun to blast apart the Taiping positions on the canal. At times, Gordon feared that assaults by the Taiping would take the &quot;Hyson&quot;, but all the attacks were repulsed. The next day, Quinsan fell to the 4th Regiment, which led a proud Gordon to write: &quot;The rebels did not know its importance until they lost it&quot;.

In its last years, the Taiping movement had oppressed the Chinese peasantry and as the Taipings retreated in the face of fire from the &quot;Hyson&quot;, Chinese peasants emerged from their homes to cut down and hack to death the fleeing Taipings. After the battle, Gordon was hailed as a liberator from the Taipings by the ordinary Chinese people. One British officer serving with the Ever Victorious Army described Gordon at this time as: &quot;a light-built, wiry, middle-sized man, of about thirty two years of age, in the undress uniform of the Royal Engineers. The countenance bore a pleasant frank appearance, eyes light blue with a fearless look in them, hair crisp and inclined to curl, conversation short and decided&quot;.

The Ever Victorious Army was entirely a mercenary force whose only loyalty was to money and whose men were interested in fighting only in order to gain the chance to plunder. Gordon felt very uncomfortable commanding this force and at one point had to order the summary execution of one of his officers when the latter tried to take the Ever-Victorious Army over to the Taipings, who had offered a generous bribe for switching sides. Gordon had to impose strict discipline on the Ever Victorious Army and worked hard to prevent the Army from engaging in its tendency to loot and mistreat civilians.

Gordon also had the pleasure of defeating Burgevine (whom Gordon detested), who had raised a mercenary force and joined the Taipings. After Gordon had surrounded Burgevine&#x27;s force outside of Suzhou, the latter had abandoned his own men and attempted to rejoin the Imperial side, leading Gordon to arrest him and send him to the American consul in Shanghai together with a letter asking that Burgevine be expelled from China.

As Gordon travelled up and down the Yangtze River valley, he was appalled by the scenes of poverty and suffering he saw, writing in a letter to his sister: &quot;The horrible furtive looks of the wretched inhabitants hovering around one&#x27;s boats haunts me, and the knowledge of their want of nourishment would sicken anyone; they are like wolves. The dead lie where they fall, and are, in some cases, trodden quite flat by passers by&quot;. The suffering of the Chinese people strengthened Gordon&#x27;s faith, as he argued that there had to be a just, loving God who would one day redeem humanity from all this wretchedness and misery.

During his time in China, Gordon was well-known and respected by friend and foe alike for leading from the front and going into combat armed only with his rattan cane (Gordon always refused to carry a gun or a sword), a choice of weapon that almost cost him his life several times. Gordon&#x27;s bravery in battle, his string of victories, apparent immunity to bullets and his intense, blazing blue eyes led many Chinese to believe that Gordon had supernatural powers and had harnessed the &quot;Qi&quot; (the mystical life-force traditionally believed in China to govern everything) in some extraordinary way.

===Capture of Kunshan===
Gordon then reorganised his force and advanced against Kunshan, which was captured at considerable loss. Gordon then took his force through the country, seizing towns until, with the aid of Imperial troops, capturing the city of Suzhou in November. After its surrender, Gordon personally guaranteed that any Taiping rebel who laid down his arms would be humanely treated. The Ever-Victorious Army—which was inclined to looting—had been ordered not to enter Suzhou, and only Imperial forces entered the city. Gordon was thus powerless when the Imperial forces executed all of the Taiping POWs, an act that enraged him.

A furious Gordon wrote that executing POWs was &quot;stupid&quot;, writing, &quot;if faith had been kept, there would have been no more fighting as every town would have given in&quot;. In China, the penalty for rebellion was death. Under the Chinese system of familial responsibility, all family members of a rebel were equally guilty even if they had nothing to do with the rebellious individual&#x27;s acts. The mandarins were thus much inclined to execute not only Taipings, but also their spouses, children, parents, and siblings as being all equally guilty of treason.

Gordon believed this approach was militarily counterproductive, as it encouraged the Taipings to fight to the death, which Gordon felt to be very unwise as the Taiping leader Hong Xiuquan, had become murderously paranoid, conducting bloody purges of his followers. Many Taipings were willing to surrender only if the Imperial government would spare their lives and those of their families. Even more importantly, Gordon had given his word of honour that all of the Taipings who surrendered would be well-treated, and regarded the massacre as a stain on his honour.

On 1 January 1864, Gordon was informed that a messenger from the Tongzhi Emperor was coming to see him and that he should put on his finest uniform. When the Emperor&#x27;s messenger arrived, he had with him servants carrying boxes of silver taels (coins) numbering 10,000 in total, together with banners written in the most eloquent calligraphy celebrating Gordon as a great general and a letter from the Emperor himself written in the best calligraphy on yellow silk thanking Gordon for taking Suzhou and offering all these presents as rewards.

Gordon refused all these gifts and wrote on the Emperor&#x27;s silk message: &quot;Major Gordon receives the approbation of His Majesty the Emperor with every gratification, but regrets most sincerely that owing to the circumstances which occurred since the capture of Soochow, he is unable to receive any mark of His Majesty the Emperor&#x27;s recognition&quot;. The Emperor was much offended when he received Gordon&#x27;s message at the Forbidden City, and Gordon&#x27;s military career in China was effectively over for a time. A Scotsman who knew Gordon in China wrote: &quot;he shows the Chinese that if even an able and reliable man, such as he is, is unmanageable&quot;. Following a dispute with Li over the execution of rebel leaders, Gordon withdrew his force from Suzhou and remained inactive at Kunshan until February 1864.

Gordon then made a rapprochement with Li and visited him in order to arrange for further operations. The &quot;Ever-Victorious Army&quot; resumed its high tempo advance, leading to the Battle of Changzhou, and culminating in the capture of Changzhou Fu, the principal military base of the Taipings in the region. Gordon wrote in his diary: &quot;The HOUR GLASS BROKEN&quot; and predicted that the war would soon be won. The Ever Victorious Army did not take part in the final offensive that ended the war with the Capture of Nanking as the &quot;Imps&quot;, as Gordon called the Imperial Army, wanted the honour of taking Nanking, the Taiping capital, for themselves.

===Capture of Yesing, Liyang, and Kitang===
Instead, the Ever Victorious Army was given the task of taking the secondary cities of Yesing, Liyang, and Kitang. At Kitang, Gordon was wounded for the second time on 21 March 1864, when a Taiping soldier shot him in the thigh. The wound was only slight and Gordon was soon back in action, fighting his last battle at Chang-chou in May 1864. Gordon then returned to Kunshan and disbanded his army in June 1864. During his time with the Ever Victorious Army, Gordon had won thirty-three battles in succession. Gordon wrote a letter home that his losses were &quot;no joke&quot; as 48 of his 100 officers and about 1,000 of 3,500 soldiers had been killed or wounded in action.

The Emperor promoted Gordon to the rank of &quot;tidu&quot; (提督: &quot;Chief commander of Jiangsu province&quot; – a title equal to field marshal), decorated him with the imperial yellow jacket, and raised him to Qing&#x27;s Viscount first class, but Gordon declined an additional gift of 10,000 taels of silver from the imperial treasury. Only forty men were allowed to wear the Yellow Jacket, which was the Emperor&#x27;s ceremonial bodyguard, and it was thus a signal honour for Gordon to be allowed to wear it. The British Army promoted Gordon to lieutenant-colonel on 16 February 1864, and he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 9 December 1864.

The traders of Shanghai offered Gordon huge sums of money to thank him for his work commanding the Ever Victorious Army. Gordon declined all honours of financial gain, writing: &quot;I know I shall leave China as poor as I entered it, but with the knowledge that, through my weak instrumentality, upwards of eighty to one hundred thousand lives have been spared. I want no further satisfaction than this&quot;. The British journalist Mark Urban, wrote: &quot;People saw a brave man who acted with humanity in an otherwise ghastly conflict, standing out from the other mercenaries, adventurers, and cut-throats in wanting almost nothing for himself&quot;.

In a leader in August 1864, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote about Gordon: &quot;the part of the soldier of fortune is in these days very difficult to play with honour...but if ever the actions of a soldier fighting in foreign service ought to be viewed with indulgence, and even with admiration, this exceptional tribute is due to Colonel Gordon&quot;. The Taiping Rebellion attracted much media attention in the West, and Gordon&#x27;s command of the Ever Victorious Army received much coverage from British newspapers. Gordon also gained the popular nickname, &quot;Chinese&quot; Gordon.

==Service with the Khedive==

===From the Danube to the Nile===
In October 1871, he was appointed British representative on the international commission to maintain the navigation of the mouth of the River Danube, with headquarters at Galatz. Gordon was bored with the work of the Danube commission, and spent as much time as possible exploring the Romanian countryside, whose beauty enchanted Gordon when he was not making visits to Bucharest to meet up with his old friend Romolo Gessi, who was living there at the time. During his second trip to Romania, Gordon insisted on living with ordinary people as he travelled over the countryside, commenting that Romanian peasants &quot;live like animals with no fuel, but reeds&quot;, and spent one night at the home of a poor Jewish craftsman whom Gordon praised for his kindness in sharing the single bedroom with his host, his wife, and their seven children. Gordon seemed pleased by his simple lifestyle, writing in a letter that: &quot;One night, I slept better than I have for a long time, by a fire in a fisherman&#x27;s hut&quot;.

During a visit to Bulgaria, Gordon and Gessi become involved in an incident when a Bulgarian couple told them that their 17-year-old daughter had been abducted into the harem of an Ottoman pasha, and asked them to free their daughter. Popular legend has it that Gordon and Gessi broke into the pasha&#x27;s palace at night to rescue the girl, but the truth is less dramatic. Gordon and Gessi demanded that Ahmed Pasha allow them to meet the girl alone, had their request granted after much arm-twisting, and then met the girl, who ultimately revealed she wanted to go home. Gordon and Gessi threatened to go to the British and Italian press if she was not released at once, a threat that proved sufficient to win the girl her freedom.

Gordon was promoted to colonel on 16 February 1872. In 1872, Gordon was sent to inspect the British military cemeteries in the Crimea, and when passing through Constantinople, he made the acquaintance of the Prime Minister of Egypt, Raghib Pasha. The Egyptian Prime Minister opened negotiations for Gordon to serve under the Ottoman Khedive, Isma&#x27;il Pasha, who was popularly called &quot;Isma&#x27;il the Magnificent&quot; on the account of his lavish spending. In 1869, Isma&#x27;il spent 2 million Egyptian pounds (the equivalent to $300 million U.S. dollars in today&#x27;s money) just on the party to celebrate the opening of the Suez Canal, in what was described as the party of the century. In 1873, Gordon received a definite offer from the Khedive, which he accepted with the consent of the British government, and proceeded to Egypt early in 1874. After meeting Gordon in 1874, the Khedive Isma&#x27;il had said: &quot;What an extraordinary Englishman! He doesn&#x27;t want money!&quot;.

The French-educated Isma&#x27;il Pasha greatly admired Europe as the model for excellence in everything, being an especially passionate Italophile and Francophile, saying at the beginning of his reign: &quot;My country is no longer in Africa, it is now in Europe&quot;. Isma&#x27;il was a Muslim who loved Italian wine and French champagne, and many of his more conservative subjects in Egypt and the Sudan felt alienated by a regime that was determined to Westernise the country with little regard for tradition. The languages of Khedive&#x27;s court were Turkish and French, not Arabic. The Khedive&#x27;s great dream was to make Egypt culturally a part of Europe, and he spent huge sums of money attempting to modernise and Westernise Egypt, in the process going very deeply into debt.

At the beginning of his reign in 1863, Egypt&#x27;s debt had been 3 million Egyptian pounds. When Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s reign ended in 1879, Egypt&#x27;s debt had risen to 93 million pounds. During the American Civil War, when the Union blockade had cut off the American South from the world economy, the price of Egyptian cotton, known as &quot;white gold&quot; had skyrocketed as British textile mills turned to Egypt as an alternative source of cotton, causing an economic blossoming of Egypt that ended abruptly in 1865. As the attempts of his grandfather—Muhammad Ali the Great—to depose the ruling Ottoman family in favour of his own family had failed due to the opposition of Russia and Britain, the imperialistic Ismai&#x27;il had turned his attention southwards and was determined to build an Egyptian empire in Africa, planning on subjugating the Great Lakes region and the Horn of Africa. As part of his Westernisation programme, Isma&#x27;il often hired Westerners to work in his government both in Egypt and in the Sudan. Ismai&#x27;il&#x27;s Chief of General Staff was the American general Charles Pomeroy Stone, and other veterans of the American Civil War were commanding Egyptian troops. Urban wrote that most of the Westerners in Egyptian pay were &quot;misfits&quot; who took up Egyptian service because they were unable to get ahead in their own nations.

Typical of the men that Khedive Isma&#x27;il Pasha hired was Valentine Baker, a British Army officer dishonorably discharged after being convicted of raping a young woman in England that he had been asked to chaperon. After Baker&#x27;s release from prison, Isma&#x27;il hired him to work in the Sudan. John Russell, the son of the famous war correspondent William Howard Russell, was another European recruited to serve on Gordon&#x27;s staff. The younger Russell was described by his own father as an alcoholic and spendthrift who &quot;was beyond help&quot; as it was always the &quot;same story-idleness, self-indulgence, gambling, and constant promises&quot; broken time after time, leading his father to get him a job in the Sudan, where his laziness infuriated Gordon to no end.

===Equatoria: Building Egypt&#x27;s empire in the Great Lakes region===

The Egyptian authorities had been extending their control southwards since the 1820s. Right up to 1914, Egypt was officially a &quot;vilayet&quot; (province) of the Ottoman Empire, but after Mohammed Ali become the &quot;vali&quot; (governor) of Egypt in 1805, Egypt was a &quot;de facto&quot; independent state where the authority of the Ottoman Sultan was more nominal than real. An expedition was sent up the White Nile, under Sir Samuel Baker, which reached Khartoum in February 1870 and Gondokoro in June 1871. Baker met with great difficulties and managed little beyond establishing a few posts along the Nile.

The Khedive asked for Gordon to succeed Baker as the governor of Equatoria province that comprised much of what is today South Sudan and northern Uganda. Isma&#x27;il Pasha told Gordon that he wished to expand Equatoria into the rest of Uganda, with the ultimate aim of absorbing the entire Great Lakes region of East Africa into the empire that Isma&#x27;il wanted to build in Africa. Baker&#x27;s annual salary as governor of Equatoria had been £10,000 (Egyptian pounds, about US$1 million in today&#x27;s money) and Ismail was astonished when Gordon refused that salary, saying that £2,000 per year was more than enough for him.

After a short stay in Cairo, Gordon proceeded to Khartoum via Suakin and Berber. In Khartoum, Gordon attended a dinner with the Governor-General, Ismail Aiyub Pasha, entertained with barely dressed belly dancers whom one of Gordon&#x27;s officers drunkenly attempted to have sex with, leading to a disgusted Gordon walking out, saying he was shocked that Aiyub allowed these things to happen in his palace. Joining Gordon on the journey to Equatoria was his old friend Romolo Gessi and a former US Army officer, Charles Chaillé-Long, who did not get along well with Gordon.

From Khartoum, he proceeded up the White Nile to Gondokoro. During his time in Sudan, Gordon was much involved in attempting to suppress the slave trade while struggling against a corrupt and inefficient Egyptian bureaucracy that had no interest in suppressing the trade. Gordon soon learned that his superior, the Governor-General of the Sudan, Ismail Aiyub Pasha, was deeply involved in the slave trade and was doing everything within his power to sabotage Gordon&#x27;s anti-slavery work by denying him supplies and leaking information to the slavers. Gordon also clashed with Chaillé-Long, whom he accused of working as an informant for Aiyub Pasha and called him to his face a &quot;regular failure&quot;. Chaillé-Long in return painted a very unflattering picture of Gordon in his 1884 book &quot;The Three Prophets&quot;, whom he portrayed as a bully, a raging alcoholic, an incompetent leader, and a rank coward. Faught argued that since no one else who knew Gordon in Equatoria described him in these terms, and given that Gordon&#x27;s accusation that Chaillé-Long was a spy for Aiyub Pasha seems to be justified, that Chaillé-Long was engaging in character assassination as an act of revenge.

Gordon, despite his position as an official in the Ottoman Empire, found the Ottoman-Egyptian system of rule inherently oppressive and cruel, coming into increasing conflict with the very system he was supposed to uphold, later stating about his time in the Sudan, &quot;I taught the natives they had a right to exist&quot;. In the Ottoman Empire, power was exercised via a system of institutionalised corruption where officials looted their provinces via heavy taxes and by demanding kickbacks known as &quot;baksheesh&quot;; some of the money went to Constantinople with the rest being pocketed by the officials.

Gordon established a close rapport with the African peoples of Equatoria such as the Nuer and Dinka, who had long suffered from the activity of Arab slave traders, and who naturally supported Gordon&#x27;s efforts to stamp out the slave trade. The peoples of Equatoria had traditionally worshipped spirits present in nature, but were steadily being converted to Christianity by missionaries from Europe and the United States, which further encouraged Gordon in his efforts as governor of Equatoria, who notwithstanding his position working for the Egyptian government, saw himself as doing God&#x27;s work in Equatoria. Gordon was not impressed with the forces of the Egyptian state. The soldiers of the Egyptian Army were &quot;fallāḥīn&quot; (peasant) conscripts who were both ill-paid and ill-trained. The other force for law and order were the much-feared &quot;bashi-bazouks&quot;, irregulars who were not paid a salary, but were expected to support themselves by looting. The &quot;bashi-bazouks&quot; were extremely susceptible to corruption and were notorious for their brutality, especially to non-Muslims.

Gordon remained in the Equatoria province until October 1876. He quickly learned that before he could establish stations to crush the slave trade, he would have to first explore the area to find the best places for building them. A major problem for Gordon was malaria, which decimated his men, and led him to issue the following order: &quot;Never let the mosquito curtain out of your sight, it is more valuable than your revolver&quot;. The heat greatly affected Gordon as he wrote to his sister Augusta, &quot;This is a horrid climate, I seldom if ever get a good sleep&quot;.

Gordon had succeeded in establishing a line of way stations from the Sobat confluence on the White Nile to the frontier of Uganda, where he proposed to open a route from Mombasa. In 1874, he built the station at Dufile on the Albert Nile to reassemble steamers carried there past rapids for the exploration of Lake Albert. Gordon personally explored Lake Albert and the Victorian Nile, pushing on through the thick, humid jungle and steep ravines of Uganda amid heavy rains and vast hordes of insects in the summer of 1876 with an average daily temperature of , down to Lake Kyoga. Gordon wrote in his diary, &quot;It is terrible walking ... it is simply killing ... I am nearly dead&quot;.

Besides acting as an administrator and explorer, Gordon had to act as a diplomat, dealing carefully with Muteesa I, the &quot;Kabaka&quot; (king) of the Buganda, who ruled most of what is today southern Uganda, a man who did not welcome the Egyptian expansion into the Great Lakes region. Gordon&#x27;s attempts to establish an Egyptian garrison in the Buganda had been stymied by the cunning Muteesa, who forced the Egyptians to build their fort at his capital of Lubaga, making the 140 or so Egyptian soldiers his virtual hostages. Gordon chose not to meet Muteesa himself, instead sending his chief medical officer, a German convert to Islam, Dr. Emin Pasha, to negotiate a treaty wherein in exchange for allowing the Egyptians to leave the Buganda, the independence of the kingdom was recognised.

Moreover, considerable progress was made in the suppression of the slave trade. Gordon wrote in a letter to his sister about the Africans living a &quot;life of fear and misery&quot;, but in spite of the &quot;utter misery&quot; of Equatoria that, &quot;I like this work&quot;. Gordon often personally intercepted slave convoys to arrest the slavers and break the chains of the slaves, but he found that the corrupt Egyptian bureaucrats usually sold the freed Africans back into slavery, and the expense of caring for thousands of freed slaves who were a long away from home burdensome.

Gordon grew close to the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, an evangelical Christian group based in London dedicated to ending slavery all over the world, and who regularly celebrated Gordon&#x27;s efforts to end slavery in the Sudan. Urban wrote that, &quot;Newspaper readers in Bolton or Beaminister had become enraged by stories about chained black children, cruelly abducted, being sold into slave markets&quot;, and Gordon&#x27;s anti-slavery efforts contributed to his image as a saintly man.

Gordon had come into conflict with the Egyptian governor of Khartoum and Sudan over his efforts to ban slavery. The clash led to Gordon informing the Khedive that he did not wish to return to the Sudan, and he left for London. During his time in London, he was approached by Sir William Mackinnon, an enterprising Scottish ship owner who had gone into partnership with King Leopold II of the Belgians with the aim of creating a chartered company that would conquer central Africa, and wished to employ Gordon as their agent in Africa.

He accepted their offer, believing in Leopold&#x27;s and Mackinnon&#x27;s assurances their plans were purely philanthropic and they had no interest in exploiting Africans for profit but the Khedive Isma&#x27;il Pasha wrote to him saying that he had promised to return, and that he expected him to keep his word. Gordon agreed to return to Cairo, and was asked to take the position of Governor-General of the entire Sudan, which he accepted. He thereafter received the honorific rank and title of pasha in the Ottoman aristocracy.

==Governor-General of the Sudan==
Besides working to end slavery, Gordon carried out a series of reforms such as abolishing torture and public floggings where those opposed to the Egyptian state were flogged with a whip known as the &quot;kourbash&quot; made of buffalo hide.

The Europeans whom the Egyptians had hired to work as civil servants in the Sudan proved to be just as corrupt as the Egyptians. The bribes that the slave traders offered for bureaucrats to turn a blind eye to the slave trade had far more effect on the bureaucrats than did any of Gordon&#x27;s orders to suppress the slave trade, which were simply ignored. Licurgo Santoni, an Italian hired by the Egyptian state to run the Sudanese post office, wrote about Gordon&#x27;s time as Governor-General that:

Relations between Egypt and Abyssinia (later renamed Ethiopia) had become strained due to a dispute over the district of Bogos, and war broke out in 1875. An Egyptian expedition was completely defeated near Gundet. A second and larger expedition under Prince Hassan was sent the following year and was routed at Gura. Matters then remained quiet until March 1877, when Gordon proceeded to Massawa, hoping to make peace with the Abyssinians. He went up to Bogos and wrote to the king proposing terms. He received no reply as the king had gone southwards to fight with the Shoa. Gordon, seeing that the Abyssinian difficulty could wait, proceeded to Khartoum.

In 1876, Egypt went bankrupt. A group of European financial commissioners led by Evelyn Baring took charge of the Egyptian finances in an attempt to pay off the European banks who had lent so much money to Egypt. With Egypt bankrupt, the money to carry out the reforms Gordon wanted was not there. With over half of Egypt&#x27;s income going to pay the 7% interest on the debt worth 81 million Egyptian pounds that Isma&#x27;il had run up, the khedive was supportive of Gordon&#x27;s plans for reform, but unable to do very much as he lacked the money to pay his civil servants and soldiers in Egypt, much less in the Sudan.

Gordon travelled north to Cairo to meet with Baring and suggest the solution that Egypt suspend its interest payments for several years to allow Isma&#x27;il to pay the arrears owed to his soldiers and civil servants, arguing that once the Egyptian government was stabilised, then Egypt could start paying its debts without fear of causing a revolution. Faught wrote that Gordon&#x27;s plans were &quot;farsighted and humane&quot;, but Baring had no interest in Gordon&#x27;s plans to suspend the interest payments. Gordon disliked Baring, writing he had &quot;a pretentious, grand, patronizing way around him. We had a few words together ... When oil mixes with water, we will mix together&quot;.

Gordon&#x27;s attempts to end the slave trade faced resistance, most notably Rahama Zobeir, known as the &quot;King of the Slavers&quot; as he was the richest and most powerful of all the slave traders in the Sudan. An insurrection had broken out in Darfur province led by associates of Zobeir and Gordon went to deal with it. On 2 September 1877, Gordon clad in the full gold-braided ceremonial blue uniform of the Governor-General of the Sudan and wearing the &quot;tarboush&quot; (the type of fez reserved for a pasha), accompanied by an interpreter and a few &quot;bashi-bazouks&quot;, rode unannounced into the enemy camp to discuss the situation. Gordon was met by Suleiman Zobeir, the son of Rahama Zobeir, and demanded, in the name of the Khedive of Egypt, that the rebels end their rebellion and accept the authority of their lord and master, telling Zobeir that he would &quot;disarm and break them&quot; if the rebellion did not end at once. Gordon also promised that those rebels who laid down their arms would not be punished and would all be given jobs in the administration.

One chief then pledged his loyalty to the Khedive, including Suleiman Zobeir himself, though the remainder retreated to the south. Gordon visited the provinces of Berber and Dongola, and then returned to the Abyssinian frontier, before ending up back in Khartoum in January 1878. Gordon was summoned to Cairo, and arrived in March to be appointed president of a commission. The Khedive Isma&#x27;il was deposed in 1879 in favour of his son, Tewfik, by the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II following heavy diplomatic pressure from the British, French and Italian governments after Isma&#x27;il had quarrelled with Baring.

Gordon returned south and proceeded to Harar, south of Abyssinia, and, finding the administration in poor standing, dismissed the governor. In 1878, Gordon fired the governor of Equatoria for corruption and replaced him with his former chief medical officer from his time in Equatoria, Dr. Emin Pasha, who had earned Gordon&#x27;s respect. Gordon then returned to Khartoum, and went again into Darfur to suppress the slave traders. His subordinate, Gessi Pasha, fought with great success in the Bahr-el-Ghazal district in putting an end to the revolt there. In July 1878, Suleiman Zobeir had rebelled again, leading Gordon and his close friend Gessi to take to the field.

In March 1879, Gessi had inflicted a sharp defeat on Zobeir even before Gordon had joined him to pursue their old enemy. After several months of chasing Zobeir, Gessi and Gordon met at the village of Shaka in June 1879 when it was agreed that Gessi would continue the hunt while Gordon would return to Khartoum. On 15 July 1879, Gessi finally captured Suleiman Zobeir together with 250 of his men and executed them.

Gordon then tried another peace mission to Abyssinia. The matter ended with Gordon&#x27;s imprisonment and transfer to Massawa. He returned to Cairo and resigned his Sudan appointment. He had gone to the Sudan with hope that he could reform the system. According to Urabn, almost all of Gordon&#x27;s reforms failed owing to the bureaucracy of the system which remained slow, corrupt, and oppressive. At the end of his Governor-Generalship of the Sudan, Gordon had to admit that he had been a failure, an experience of defeat that so shattered him that he had a nervous breakdown. As Gordon travelled via Egypt to take the steamer back to Britain, a man who met him in Cairo described him as a broken man who was &quot;rather off his head&quot;. Before Gordon boarded the ship at Alexandria that was to take him home, he sent off a series of long telegrams to various ministers in London full of Biblical verse and quotations that he said offered the solution to all of the problems of modern life. After Gordon resigned, Muhammad Rauf Pasha succeeded him as governor general of Sudan.

In March 1880, Gordon recovered for a couple of weeks in the Hotel du Faucon in Lausanne, 3 Rue St Pierre, famous for its views on Lake Geneva and because several celebrities had stayed there, such as Giuseppe Garibaldi, one of Gordon&#x27;s heroes, and possibly one of the reasons Gordon had chosen this hotel. In the hotel&#x27;s restaurant, now a pub called Happy Days, he met another guest from Britain, the reverend R. H. Barnes, vicar of Heavitree near Exeter, who became a good friend. After Gordon&#x27;s death, Barnes co-authored &quot;Charles George Gordon: A Sketch&quot; (1885), which begins with the meeting at the hotel in Lausanne. The Reverend Reginald Barnes, who knew him well, describes him as &quot;of the middle height, very strongly built&quot;.

==Other offers==
On 2 March 1880, on his way from London to Switzerland, Gordon had visited King Leopold II of Belgium in Brussels and was invited to take charge of the Congo Free State. Leopold tried very hard to convince Gordon to enter his service, not least because Gordon was known to be modest in his salary demands, unlike Leopold&#x27;s current agent in the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley, who received a monthly salary of 300,000 Belgian francs.

Gordon rejected Leopold&#x27;s offers, partly because he was still emotionally attached to the Sudan and partly because he disliked the idea of working for Leopold&#x27;s Congo Association, which was a private company owned by the King. In April, the government of the Cape Colony offered him the position of commandant of the Cape local forces, which Gordon declined. A deeply depressed Gordon wrote in his letter declining the offer that he knew, for reasons that he refused to explain, that he had only ten years left to live, and he wanted to do something great and grand in his last ten years.

In May, the Marquess of Ripon, who had been given the post of Governor-General of India, asked Gordon to go with him as private secretary. Gordon accepted the offer, but shortly after arriving in India, he resigned. In the words of the American historian Immanuel C. Y. Hsu, Gordon was a &quot;man of action&quot; unsuited to a bureaucratic job. Gordon found the life of a private secretary to be, in his words, a &quot;living crucifixion&quot; that was unbearably boring, leading him to resign with the intention of going to East Africa, particularly Zanzibar, to suppress the slave trade.

Hardly had Gordon resigned when he was invited to Beijing by Sir Robert Hart, inspector-general of customs in China, saying his services were urgently needed in China as Russia and China were on the verge of war. Gordon was nostalgic for China, and knowing of the Sino-Russian crisis, he saw a chance to do something significant. The British diplomat Thomas Francis Wade reported, &quot;The Chinese government still holds Gordon Pasha in high regard&quot;, and were anxious to have him back to fight against Russia if war should break out.

An exchange of telegrams ensued between the War Office in London and Gordon in Bombay about just what exactly he was planning on doing in China, and when Gordon replied that he would find out when he got there, he was ordered to stay. He disobeyed orders and left on the first ship to China, an action that very much angered the Army&#x27;s commander, the Duke of Cambridge. Gordon arrived in Shanghai in July and met Li Hongzhang, and learned that there was risk of war with Russia. After meeting his old friend, Gordon assured Li that if Russia should attack he would resign his commission in the British Army to take up a commission in the Chinese Army, an action that if taken, risked prosecution under the Foreign Enlistments Act.

Gordon informed the Foreign Office that he was willing to renounce his British citizenship and take Chinese citizenship as he would not abandon Li and his other Chinese friends should a Sino-Russian war begin. Gordon&#x27;s willingness to renounce his British citizenship in order to fight with China in the event of war did much to raise his prestige in China.

Gordon went to Beijing and used all his influence to ensure peace. He clashed repeatedly with Prince Chun, the leader of the war party in Beijing, who rejected Gordon&#x27;s advice to seek a compromise solution as Gordon warned that the powerful Russian naval squadron in the Yellow Sea would allow the Russians to land at Tianjin and advance on Beijing. At one point during a meeting with the Council of Ministers, an enraged Gordon picked up a Chinese–English dictionary, looked up the word idiocy, and then pointed at the equivalent Chinese word 白痴 with one hand while pointing at the ministers with the other.

Gordon further advised the Qing court that it was unwise for the Manchu elite to live apart from and treat the Han Chinese majority as something less than human, warning that this not only weakened China in the present, but would cause a revolution in the future. After speaking so bluntly, Gordon was ordered out of the court in Beijing, but was allowed to stay at Tianjin. After meeting with him there, Hart described Gordon as &quot;very eccentric&quot; and &quot;spending hours in prayer&quot;, writing that: &quot;As much I like and respect him, I must say he is &#x27;not all there&#x27;. Whether religion or vanity, or the softening of the brain — I don&#x27;t know, but he seems to be alternatively arrogant and slavish, vain and humble, in his senses and out of them. It&#x27;s a great pity!&quot; Wade echoed Hart, writing that Gordon had changed since his last time in China, and was now &quot;unbalanced&quot;, being utterly convinced that all of his ideas came from God, making him dangerously unreasonable since he now believed that everything he did was the will of God.

Gordon was ordered home by London as the Foreign Office was not comfortable with the idea of him commanding the Chinese Army against Russia if war should break out, believing that this would cause an Anglo-Russian war and Gordon was told that he would be dishonourably discharged if he remained in China. Although the Qing court rejected Gordon&#x27;s advice to seek a compromise with Russia in the summer of 1880, Gordon&#x27;s assessment of China&#x27;s military backwardness and his stark warnings that the Russians would win if a war did break out played an important role in ultimately strengthening the peace party at the court and preventing war.

Gordon returned to Britain and rented a flat on 8 Victoria Grove in London. In October 1880, he paid a two-week visit to Ireland, landing at Cork and travelling over much of the island. Gordon was sickened by the poverty of the Irish farmers, which led him to write a six-page memo to the Prime Minister, William Gladstone, urging land reforms in Ireland. Gordon wrote: &quot;The peasantry of the Northwest and Southwest of Ireland are much worse off than any of the inhabitants of Bulgaria, Asia Minor, China, India, or the Sudan&quot;. Having been to all of those places and thus speaking with some authority, Gordon announced the &quot;scandal&quot; of poverty in Ireland could only be ended if the government were to buy the land from the Ascendency families, as the Anglo-Irish elite was known, and give it to their poor Irish tenant farmers.

Gordon compared his plans for rural reform in Ireland to the abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1833, and ended his letter with the assertion that if this were done, the unity of the United Kingdom would be preserved as the Irish would appreciate this great act of justice and the Irish independence movement would cease to exist as &quot;they would have nothing more to seek from agitation&quot;. Besides championing land reform in Ireland, Gordon spent the winter of 1880–81 in London socialising with his family and his few friends, such as Florence Nightingale and Alfred Tennyson.

In April 1881, Gordon left for Mauritius as Commander, Royal Engineers. He remained in Mauritius until March 1882. The American historian John Semple Galbraith described Gordon as suffering from &quot;utter boredom&quot; during his time there. Gordon saw his work in building forts to protect Mauritius from a possible Russian naval attack as pointless, and his main achievement during his time there was to advise the Crown to turn the Seychelles islands, whose beauty had greatly moved Gordon, into a new crown colony as Gordon argued it was impossible to govern the Seychelles from Port Louis.

In a memo to London, Gordon warned against over-reliance on the Suez Canal, where the Russians could easily sink one ship to block the entire canal, thus leading Gordon to advise upon improving the Cape route to India with Britain developing a series of bases in Africa and in the Indian Ocean. Gordon visited the Seychelles in the summer of 1881 and decided the islands were the location of the Garden of Eden. On the island of Praslin in the Valle de Mai, Gordon believed that he found the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the form of a coco de mer tree which fruit bore a close resemblance to a woman&#x27;s body. Gordon was promoted to major-general on 23 March 1882.

Being unemployed, Gordon decided to go to Palestine, which at the time was part of the Ottoman &quot;vilayet&quot; of Syria, a region he had long desired to visit, where he would remain for a year (1882–83). During his &quot;career break&quot; in the Holy Land, the very religious Gordon sought to explore his faith and biblical sites.

In Jerusalem, Gordon lived with an American lawyer, Horatio Spafford, and his wife, Anna Spafford, who were the leaders of the American Colony in the Holy City. The Spaffords had lost their home and much of their fortune in the Great Chicago Fire and then had seen one of their sons die of scarlet fever, four of their daughters drowned in a shipwreck, followed by the death of another son from scarlet fever, causing them to turn to religion as consolation for unbearable tragedy, making them very congenial company for Gordon during his stay in Jerusalem. After his visit, Gordon suggested in his book &quot;Reflections in Palestine&quot; a different location for Golgotha, the site of Christ&#x27;s crucifixion. The site lies north of the traditional site at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and is now known as &quot;The Garden Tomb&quot;, or sometimes as &quot;Gordon&#x27;s Calvary&quot;. Gordon&#x27;s interest was prompted by his religious beliefs, as he had become an evangelical Christian in 1854.

King Leopold II then asked Gordon again to take charge of the Congo Free State. He accepted and returned to London to make preparations, but soon after his arrival, the British requested that he proceed immediately to the Sudan, where the situation had deteriorated badly after his departure — another revolt had arisen, led by the self-proclaimed Mahdi, Mohammed Ahmed. The Mahdi is a messianic figure in Islam which tradition holds will appear at the dawn of every new (Islamic) century to strike down the enemies of Islam.

The year 1881 was the Islamic year 1298, and to mark the coming of the new century, Ahmed announced that he was the Mahdi, and proclaimed a &quot;jihad&quot; against the Egyptian state. The long exploitation of the Sudan by Egypt led many Sudanese to rally to the Mahdi&#x27;s black banner as he promised to expel the Egyptians, whom Ahmed denounced as apostates, and he announced he would establish an Islamic fundamentalist state marking a return to the &quot;pure Islam&quot; said to have been practised in the days of the Prophet Mohamed in Arabia.

Additionally, Baring&#x27;s policy of raising taxes to pay off the debts Isma&#x27;il had run up sparked much resentment in both Egypt and the Sudan. In 1882, nationalist rage in Egypt against Baring&#x27;s economic policies led to the revolt by Colonel Urabi Pasha, which was put down by Anglo-Egyptian troops. From September 1882 onwards, Egypt was a &quot;de facto&quot; British protectorate effectively ruled by Baring, though in theory, Egypt remained an Ottoman province with a very wide degree of autonomy until 1914. With Egypt under British rule, the British also inherited the problems of Egypt&#x27;s colony, the Sudan, which the Egyptians were losing control of to the Mahdi.

==Mahdist uprising==
===Mission to Khartoum===
The Egyptian forces in the Sudan were insufficient to cope with the rebels, and the northern government was occupied with the suppression of the Urabi Revolt. By September 1882, the Egyptian position in the Sudan had grown perilous. In September 1883, an Egyptian Army force under Colonel William Hicks set out to destroy the Mahdi. The Egyptian soldiers were miserable &quot;fallāḥīn&quot; conscripts who had no interest in being in the Sudan, much less in fighting the Mahdi, and morale was so poor that Hicks had to chain his men together to prevent them from deserting.

On 3–5 November 1883, the &quot;Ansar&quot; (whom the British called &quot;Dervishes&quot;), as the Mahdi&#x27;s followers were known, destroyed the Egyptian army of 8,000 under Colonel Hicks at El Obeid, with only about 250 Egyptians surviving and Hicks being one of the slain. The &quot;Ansar&quot; captured a large number of Remington rifles and ammunition cases together with many Krupp artillery guns and their shells. After the Battle of El Obeid, Egyptian morale, never high to begin with, simply collapsed, and the black flag of the Mahdi soon flew over many towns in the Sudan. By the end of 1883, the Egyptians held only the ports on the Red Sea and a narrow belt of land around the Nile in northern Sudan. In both cases, naval power was the key factor, as gunboats in the Red Sea and on the Nile provided a degree of firepower with which the &quot;Ansar&quot; could not cope.

The only other place to hold out for a time was a region in the south held by the Governor of Equatoria, Emin Pasha. Following the destruction of Hicks&#x27;s army, the Liberal Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone, decided that the Sudan was not worth the trouble it would take to keep, and that the region should be abandoned to the Mahdi. In December 1883, the British government ordered Egypt to abandon the Sudan, but that was difficult to carry out, as it involved the withdrawal of thousands of Egyptian soldiers, civilian employees, and their families.

At the beginning of 1884, Gordon had no interest in the Sudan and had just been hired to work as an officer with the newly-established Congo Free State. Gordon — despite or rather, because of his war hero status — disliked publicity and tried to avoid the press when he was in Britain. While staying with his sister in Southampton, Gordon received an unexpected visitor, namely William Thomas Stead, the editor of &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, to whom Gordon reluctantly agreed to give an interview. Gordon wanted to talk about the Congo, but Stead kept on pressing him to talk about the Sudan. Finally, after much prompting on Stead&#x27;s part, Gordon opened up and attacked Gladstone&#x27;s Sudan policy, coming out for an intervention to defeat the Mahdi. Gordon offered up a 19th-century anticipation of the domino theory, claiming: The danger arises from the influence which the spectacle of a conquering Mahometan Power established close to your frontiers will exercise upon the population which you govern. In all the cities of Egypt, it will be felt that what the Mahdi has done, they may do; and, as he has driven out the intruder, they may do the same. Stead published his interview on 9 January 1884, on the front page of the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; alongside an editorial of his titled, &quot;Chinese Gordon for the Sudan&quot;. Urban wrote: &quot;With this leader, William Stead&#x27;s real motive in going to Southampton revealed itself at last. As to who tipped him off that the general would be staying here for just a couple of nights, we can only speculate&quot;.

Stead&#x27;s interview caused a media sensation and led to a popular clamour for Gordon to be sent to the Sudan. Urban wrote: &quot;The &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; articles, in short, began a new chapter in international relations; powerful men using media manipulation of public opinion to trigger war. It is often suggested that that campaign by William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s paper that led to the US invasion of Cuba in 1898 was the world&#x27;s first episode of this kind, but the British press deserves these dubious laurels for its actions a full fourteen years earlier&quot;. The man behind the campaign was the Adjutant General, Sir Garnet Wolseley—a skilled media manipulator who often leaked information to the press to effect changes in policy—and who was strongly opposed to Gladstone&#x27;s policy of pulling out of the Sudan.

In 1880, the Liberals had won the general election on a platform of overseas retrenchment, and Gladstone had put his principles into practice by withdrawing from the Transvaal and Afghanistan in 1881. There was a secret &quot;ultra&quot; faction in the War Office led by Wolseley that felt that the Liberal government was too inclined to withdraw from various places all over the globe at the first sign of trouble, and who were determined to sabotage the withdrawal from the Sudan. Gordon and Wolseley were good friends (Wolseley being one of the people Gordon prayed for every night), and after a meeting with Wolseley at the War Office to discuss the crisis in the Sudan, Gordon left convinced that he had to go to the Sudan to &quot;carry out the work of God&quot;.

With public opinion demanding that Gordon be sent to the Sudan, on 16 January 1884, the Gladstone government decided to send him there, albeit with the very limited mandate to report on the situation and advise on the best means of carrying out the evacuation. Gladstone had gone to his estate at Hawarden to recover from illness and thus was not present at the meeting on 18 January where Gordon was given the Sudan command, but he was under the impression that Gordon&#x27;s mission was advisory, whereas the four ministers present at the meeting had given Gordon the impression that his mission was executive in nature.

Gladstone felt that this was a deft political move. Public opinion would be satisfied with &quot;Chinese Gordon&quot; going to the Sudan, but at the same time, Gordon was given such a limited mandate that the evacuation would proceed as planned. The Cabinet felt highly uncomfortable with the appointment, as they had been pressured by the press to send a man who was opposed to their Sudan policy to take command there. The Foreign Secretary, Lord Grenville, wondered if they had just committed a &quot;gigantic folly&quot;. Gordon made a short trip to Brussels to tell King Leopold that he would not be going to the Congo after all, news that enraged the King.

The British government asked Gordon to go to Khartoum to report on the best method of carrying out the evacuation. Gordon started for Cairo in January 1884, accompanied by Lt. Col. J. D. H. Stewart. At Cairo, he received further instructions from Sir Evelyn Baring, and was appointed Governor-General with executive powers by the Khedive Tewfik Pasha, who also gave Gordon an edict ordering him to establish a government in the Sudan. This Gordon would later use as a reason for staying in Khartoum. Baring disapproved of sending Gordon to the Sudan, writing in a report to London that: &quot;A man who habitually consults the Prophet Isaiah when he is in a difficulty is not apt to obey the orders of anyone&quot;. Gordon immediately confirmed Baring&#x27;s fears as he started to issue press statements attacking the rebels as &quot;a feeble lot of stinking Dervishes&quot; and demanded he be allowed to &quot;smash up the Mahdi&quot;. Gordon sent a telegram to Khartoum reading: &quot;Don&#x27;t be panic-stricken. Ye are men, not women. I am coming. Gordon&quot;.

Urban wrote that Gordon&#x27;s &quot;most stupid mistake&quot; occurred when he revealed his secret orders at a meeting of tribal leaders on 12 February at Berber, explaining that the Egyptians were pulling out, leading to almost all of the Arab tribes of northern Sudan declaring their loyalty to the Mahdi. Given that Gordon himself in his interview with Stead had stated: &quot;The moment it is known that we have given up the game, every man will go over to the Mahdi&quot;, his decision to reveal that the Egyptians were pulling out remains inexplicable. Shortly afterwards, Gordon wrote what Urban called a &quot;bizarre&quot; letter to the Mahdi telling him to accept the authority of the Khedive of Egypt and offered him the chance to work as one of Gordon&#x27;s provincial governors. The Mahdi contemptuously rejected Gordon&#x27;s offer and sent back a letter demanding Gordon convert to Islam.

The Mahdi ended his letter with the remark: &quot;I am the Expected Mahdi and I do not boast! I am the successor of God&#x27;s Prophet and I have no need of any sultanate of Kordofan or anywhere else!&quot; Even Wolseley had cause to regret sending Gordon, as the general revealed himself to be a loose cannon whose press statements attacking the Liberal government were &quot;obstructing rather than furthering his plans to take over the Sudan&quot;. Travelling through Korosko and Berber, he arrived at Khartoum on 18 February, where he offered his earlier foe, the slaver-king Rahama Zobeir, release from prison in exchange for leading troops against Ahmed.

Gordon&#x27;s abrupt mood swings and contradictory advice confirmed the Cabinet&#x27;s view of him as mercurial and unstable. Even an observer as sympathetic as Winston Churchill wrote about Gordon: &quot;Mercury uncontrolled by the force of gravity was not on several occasions more unstable than Charles Gordon. His moods were capricious and uncertain, his passions violent, his impulses sudden and inconsistent. The mortal enemy of the morning had become a trusted ally by night&quot;.

The novelist John Buchan wrote that Gordon was so &quot;unlike other men that he readily acquired a spiritual ascendency over all who knew him well and many who did not&quot;, but at the same time, Gordon had a &quot;dualism&quot;, in that &quot;the impression of single-heartedness was an illusion, for all his life his soul was the stage of conflict&quot;. Gordon&#x27;s attempt to have his former archenemy Zobeir—the &quot;King of the Slavers&quot; whom he had hunted for years and whose son he had executed—installed as the new Sultan of the Sudan appalled Gladstone and offended his former admirers in the Anti-Slavery Society.

===Preparing the defence of Khartoum===

After arriving in Khartoum, Gordon announced that on the grounds of honour, he would not evacuate Khartoum, but rather, would hold the city against the Mahdi. Gordon was well-received by a crowd of about 9,000 during his return to Khartoum where the crowd continually chanted, &quot;Father!&quot; and &quot;Sultan!&quot; Gordon assured the people of Khartoum in a speech delivered in his rough-hewn Arabic that the Mahdi was coming with his Army of Islam marching under their black banners, but to have no fear as here he would be stopped. Gordon had a garrison of about 8,000 soldiers armed with Remington rifles, together with a colossal ammunition dump containing millions of rounds.

Gordon commenced the task of sending the women, the children, the sick, and the wounded to Egypt. About 2,500 people had been removed before the Mahdi&#x27;s forces closed in on Khartoum. Gordon hoped to have the influential local leader, Sebehr Rahma, appointed to take control of Sudan, but the British government refused to support a former slaver. During this time in Khartoum, Gordon befriended Irish journalist Frank Powers, &quot;The Times&quot; (London) correspondent in the Sudan. Powers was delighted that the charismatic Gordon had no anti-Catholic prejudices and treated him as an equal. The hero-worshiping Powers wrote about Gordon: &quot;He is indeed I believe the greatest man of this century&quot;. Gordon granted Powers privileged access and in return, Powers started to write a series of popular articles for &quot;The Times&quot; depicting Gordon as the solitary hero taking on a vast horde of fanatical Muslims.

Gordon made all of his personal dispatches to London public (there was no Official Secrets Act at the time) in attempts to win public opinion over to his policy, writing on one dispatch: &quot;Not secret as far as I am concerned&quot;. At one point, Gordon suggested in a telegram to Gladstone that the notoriously corrupt Ottoman Sultan Abdul-Hamid II could be bribed into sending 3,000 Ottoman troops for the relief of Khartoum and if the British government was unwilling and/or unable to pay that amount, he was certain that either Pope Leo XIII or a group of American millionaires would be.

The advance of the rebels against Khartoum was combined with a revolt in the eastern Sudan. Colonel Valentine Baker led an Egyptian force out of Suakin and was badly defeated by 1,000 Haddendowa warriors who declared their loyalty to the Mahdi under Osman Digna at Al-Teb with 2,225 Egyptian soldiers and 96 officers killed. Because the Egyptian troops at Suakin were repeatedly defeated, a British force was sent to Suakin under General Sir Gerald Graham, which drove the rebels away in several hard-fought actions. At Tamai on 13 March 1884, Graham was attacked by the Haddendowa (whom the British nicknamed &quot;Fuzzy Wuzzies&quot;) whom he defeated, but in the course of the battle, the Haddendowa broke a Black Watch square, an action later celebrated in the Kipling poem &quot;Fuzzy-Wuzzy&quot;.

The ferocity of the Haddendowa attacks astonished the British, and Graham argued that he needed more troops if he were to advance deeper into the Sudan while one newspaper correspondent reported that the average British soldiers did not understand why they were in the Sudan fighting &quot;such brave fellows&quot; for &quot;the sake of the wretched Egyptians&quot;. Gordon urged that the road from Suakin to Berber be opened, but his request was refused by the government in London, and in April Graham and his forces were withdrawn and Gordon and the Sudan were abandoned. The garrison at Berber surrendered in May, and Khartoum was completely isolated.

Gordon decided to stay and hold Khartoum despite the orders of the Gladstone government to merely report about the best means of supervising the evacuation of the Sudan. Powers, who acted as Gordon&#x27;s unofficial press attaché, wrote in &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;We are daily expecting British troops. We cannot bring ourselves to believe that we are to be abandoned&quot;. In his diary, Gordon wrote: &quot;I own to having been very insubordinate to Her Majesty&#x27;s Government and its officials, but it is my nature, and I cannot help it. I fear I have not even tried to play battledore and shuttlecock with them. I know if &quot;I&quot; was chief I would never employ &quot;myself&quot; for I am incorrigible&quot;.

Due to public opinion, the government dared not sack Gordon, but the Cabinet was extremely angry about Gordon&#x27;s insubordination, with many privately saying if Gordon wanted to defy orders by holding Khartoum, then he only deserved what he was going to get. Gladstone himself took Gordon&#x27;s attacks on his Sudan policy very personally. One Cabinet minister wrote: &quot;The London newspapers and the Tories clamor for an expedition to Khartoum, the former from ignorance, the latter because it is the best model of embarrassing us ... Of course it is not an impossible undertaking, but it is melancholy to think of the waste of lives and the treasure which it must involve&quot;. The Cabinet itself was divided and confused about just what to do about the Sudan crisis, leading to a highly dysfunctional style of decision-making.

Gordon had a strong death wish, and clearly wanted to die fighting at Khartoum, writing in a letter to his sister: &quot;I feel so very much inclined to wish it His will might be my release. Earth&#x27;s joys grow very dim, its glories have faded&quot;. In his biography of Gordon, Anthony Nutting wrote that Gordon was obsessed with &quot;the ever-present, constantly repeated desire for martyrdom and for that glorious immortality in union with God and away from the wretchedness of life on this earth&quot;.

Because his Turkish and Egyptian (and many Sudanese) troops were Muslim, Gordon refrained in public from describing his battle with the Mahdi as a religious war, but Gordon&#x27;s diary showed he viewed himself as a Christian champion fighting against the Mahdi just as much for God as for his nation. The Mahdi and his followers had been fighting a &quot;jihad&quot; since 1881 and looked forward to taking on the famous General Gordon as a chance to win glory for Allah.

Gordon energetically organised the defence of Khartoum right from the moment he arrived in Khartoum, using his training as a military engineer to turn the city into a fortress. Additionally, Gordon had guns and armoured plating attached to the paddle wheel steamers stationed at Khartoum to create his own private riverine navy that served as an effective force against the &quot;Ansar&quot;. The Turkish troops at Khartoum were not part of the Ottoman Army, but rather &quot;bashi-bazouks&quot;, irregulars whom Gordon commented were good for raids, but useless in battle.

The Shaggyeh (one of the few Arab tribes who did not rally to the Mahdi) drove Gordon to distraction, with Gordon writing in his diary about them: &quot;Dreadful lot! How I look forward to their disbandment&quot;. Gordon had a low opinion of the Egyptian, Turkish, and Arab Sudanese troops under his command—whom he constantly described as a mutinous, badly disciplined, and ill-trained rabble good only for looting — but had a much higher opinion of his Black Sudanese soldiers, most of them former slaves who would rather die fighting as free men than live as slaves again; it was well known that the Mahdi&#x27;s forces were going to enslave the Blacks of Khartoum once they took the city. The black Sudanese troops, many from what is now South Sudan, proved to be Gordon&#x27;s best troops at Khartoum and numbered about twenty-three hundred.

===The siege of Khartoum===

The siege of Khartoum by the Mahdist forces, commanded by the Mahdi himself, started on 18 March 1884. Initially, the siege of Khartoum was more in nature a blockade rather than a true siege as the Mahdi&#x27;s forces lacked the strength to wage a proper siege, for example, cutting the telegraphy lines only in April 1884. The British government had decided to abandon the Sudan, but it was clear that Gordon had other plans, and the public increasingly called for a relief expedition. Gordon&#x27;s last telegrams were clearly meant for the British public, with one message addressed to Baring reading: &quot;You state your intention of not sending any relief force up here to Berber ... I shall hold on here as long as I can, and if I can suppress the rebellion, I shall do so. If I cannot, I shall retire to the Equator and leave you with the indelible disgrace of abandoning the garrisons&quot;.

Gladstone was opposed to hanging onto the Sudan, saying in a speech in the House of Commons that sending a relief force to Khartoum would be &quot;a war of conquest against a people struggling to be free. Yes, these are people struggling to be free and rightly struggling to be free&quot;. Khartoum was surrounded by the &quot;Ansar&quot; in March 1884, but was not cut off from the outside world for a considerable time afterward. Gordon&#x27;s armoured steamers continued to sail in and out of Khartoum with little difficulty for the first six months of the siege, and it was not until September 1884 that the armoured steamers first had trouble reaching the city.

Gordon had a low opinion of his enemy, writing that the &quot;Ansar&quot; besieging him were &quot;some 500 determined men and some 2,000 rag-tag Arabs&quot;. Nutting wrote that Gordon &quot;could have withdrawn at almost any moment between March and May&quot; if only he had been willing. American historian James Perry wrote: &quot;But instead of following instructions, he stayed put, longing for martyrdom. It wasn&#x27;t exactly fair to the Egyptian garrisons he had been sent to evacuate; they had no death wish&quot;. On 25 July 1884, the Cabinet, over the objections of the Prime Minister, voted to send a relief expedition to Khartoum. On 5 August 1884, the House of Commons voted to send the relief force with a budget of £300,000.

During this time, Gordon, when he was not organising the besieged garrison with incredible energy, spent his time writing a somewhat rambling diary containing his reflections on the siege, life, fate, and his own intense, idiosyncratic version of Protestantism. Gordon waged a very vigorous defence, sending out his armoured steamers to engage the &quot;Ansar&quot; camps along the Blue Nile while he regularly made raids on the besiegers that often gave the Madhi&#x27;s forces a &quot;bloody nose&quot;. Elated by these successes, Gordon wrote in his diary: &quot;We are going to hold out here forever&quot;.

To keep up morale, Gordon had a military band perform concerts in the central plaza every Friday and Sunday evenings for free, and cast his own decorations for his men. Though the telegraph lines to Cairo were cut, Gordon used the remaining telegraph lines to build his own telegraph network within Khartoum linking the men holding the walls of Khartoum to the Governor-General&#x27;s palace, thus keeping him well-informed of what was happening. To slow down the &quot;Ansar&quot; assaults, Gordon built primitive landmines out of water cans stuffed with dynamite and to confuse the enemy about his numbers, he put up wooden dummies in uniform along the walls of Khartoum facing the Blue Nile.

It was not until August 1884 that the government decided to take steps to relieve Gordon, with the British relief force, called the Nile Expedition, or, more popularly, the Khartoum Relief Expedition or Gordon Relief Expedition (a title that Gordon strongly deprecated). The relief force, under the command of Gordon&#x27;s old friend, Field Marshal Sir Garnet Wolseley, was not ready until November 1884. Wolseley had earlier served in Canada where he had commanded the Red River expedition of 1870, during which time he gained considerable respect for the skills of French-Canadian , and now insisted he could not travel up the Nile without the to assist his men as river pilots and boatmen.

It took considerable time to hire the in Canada and bring them to Egypt, which delayed the expedition. Some of the who arrived in Egypt turned out to be lawyers led by an alderman from Toronto who wanted to see &quot;the fun&quot; of war and were useless as boatmen. Wolseley was a bureaucratic general whose talents lay in administrative work, and as a field commander, Wolseley was slow, methodical, and cautious, making him, in the opinion of Urban, supremely unqualified to lead the relief expedition as he found one excuse after another to proceed up the Nile at a sluggish pace. For example, Wolseley could have hired Egyptian boatmen who knew the Nile to serve as river pilots instead of bringing over from Canada, who knew nothing of the Nile, and moreover, Wolseley called for the only after his arrival in Egypt.

===On the brink===
On 4 September 1884, Gordon&#x27;s fortunes took a turn for the worse when the most able of his subordinates, Mohammed Aly, together with about 1,000 of Gordon&#x27;s best troops, were killed in an ambush while conducting a raid. Gordon wrote in his diary that Mohammed Aly had captured &quot;a lad of 12 or 14 years of age, and the little chap spoke out boldly, and said he believed Mohamed Ahmed was the Mahdi and that we were dogs. He was shot! Before I heard of our defeat I heard of this, and I thought, &#x27;THAT will not pass unavenged&#x27;.&quot;

On 9 September 1884, an armoured steamer, the &quot;Abbas,&quot; on its way to Cairo, was captured by the &quot;Ansar&quot; for the first time and all aboard were killed. Among the dead were Gordon&#x27;s unofficial spokesman, the passionate wordsmith and &quot;Times&quot; journalist Frank Powers, Gordon&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Colonel Stewart, and the French consul in Khartoum, , all of whom Gordon was sending to Cairo to plead for relief. Gordon received a letter from the Mahdi taunting him over the murders of his friends Powers and Stewart, warning that he would be next if he did not surrender. Bitterly, Gordon wrote in his diary: &quot;It is impossible to have any more words with Mohammed Achmed, only lead.&quot;

Among the papers captured on the &quot;Abbas&quot; was the cipher key Gordon used to code his messages in and out of Khartoum, which meant he could no longer read the messages he received, leading him to write in his diary: &quot;I think cipher-messages are in some countries, like this, a mistake&quot;. During this period, Gordon was lionised by the British press, which portrayed him as a latter-day Christian crusader and a saint, a man of pure good, heroically battling the Mahdi, who was depicted as a man of pure evil. The &quot;Pall Mall Gazette,&quot; in a front page leader, wrote that Gordon stood &quot;out in clear relief against the Eastern sky. Alone in [Africa], dauntless and unfaltering, he discharges his great trust, holding the capital of the Sudan against the beleaguering hordes&quot;. The defences Gordon had built with lines of earthwork, mines, and barbed wire presented the &quot;Ansar&quot; with much difficulty and their attempts to storm Khartoum failed, but the &quot;Ansar&quot; made good use of their Krupp artillery to gradually batter down the defences. To counter Gordon&#x27;s armoured steamers, the Mahdi built a series of forts along the Nile equipped with Krupp guns that over time proceeded to make it almost impossible for Gordon&#x27;s navy to operate.

By the end of 1884, both the garrison and the population of Khartoum were starving to death; there were no horses, donkeys, cats, or dogs left in Khartoum as the people had eaten all of them. Gordon told the civilians of Khartoum that anyone who wished to leave, even to join the Mahdi&#x27;s army, were free to do so. About half of the population took up his offer to promptly leave the city. A note written by Gordon and dated 14 December was sent out by a messenger from Khartoum, who reached Wolseley&#x27;s army on 30 December 1884.

The note read &quot;Khartoum all right. Can hold out for years. C. G. Gordon&quot;, but the messenger (who knew very little English) had memorised another, darker message from Gordon, namely: &quot;We want you to come quickly&quot;. In the same month, Gordon received a letter from the Mahdi offering safe passage out of Khartoum: &quot;We have written to you to go back to your country ... I repeat to you the words of Allah, Do not destroy yourself. Allah Himself is merciful to you&quot;.

Gordon and the Mahdi never met, but the two men, both charismatic and intensely religious soldiers who saw themselves as fighting for God, had developed a grudging mutual respect. However, Faught wrote that there was a fundamental difference between Gordon and the Mahdi in that Gordon never tried to convert the Muslims of the Sudan to Christianity whereas the Mahdi was an &quot;Islamic extremist&quot; who believed he would establish a worldwide caliphate, looking forward to the day when he would &quot;see the world bow before him&quot;.

During November–December 1884, Gordon&#x27;s diary showed the stressful effects of the siege, as he was in a state of mental exhaustion, a man on the brink of madness. In his final months, Gordon oscillated between a longing for martyrdom and death versus an intense horror at the prospect of his own demise as the hour of his destruction rapidly approached. Even if the relief force had reached him, it is not clear if he would have left Khartoum, as Gordon wrote in his diary: &quot;If any emissary or letter comes up here ordering me to come down I WILL NOT OBEY IT, BUT WILL STAY HERE, AND FALL WITH THE TOWN!&quot;

At another point, a death-obsessed Gordon wrote in his diary: &quot;Better a bullet to the brain than to flicker out unheeded&quot;. In a letter that reached Cairo in December, Gordon wrote: &quot;Farewell. You will never hear from me again. I fear that there will be treachery in the garrison, and all will be over by Christmas.&quot; On 14 December 1884, Gordon wrote the last entry in his diary, which read: &quot;Now MARK THIS, if the Expeditionary Force and I ask for no more than two hundred men, does not come in ten days, &quot;the town may fall&quot;; and I have done my best for the honour of our country. Goodbye, C. G. Gordon&quot;. A chain-smoking Gordon constantly paced the roof of his palace during the day, looking vainly for smoke on the Nile indicating that the steamers were coming, while spending much of the rest of his time in prayer.

On 5 January 1885, the &quot;Ansar&quot; took the fort at Omdurman, which allowed them to use their Krupp artillery to bring down enfilading fire on the defences of Khartoum. In one of the last letters Gordon had smuggled out, he wrote: &quot;I expect Her Majesty&#x27;s Government are in a precious rage with me for holding out, and so forcing their hands&quot;. In his last weeks, those who knew Gordon described him as a chain-smoking, rage-filled, desperate man wearing a shabby uniform who spent hours talking to a mouse that he shared his office with when he was not attacking his Sudanese servants with his rattan cane during one of his rages.

A particular aspect of Gordon&#x27;s personality that stood out was his death wish, as everyone who knew him was convinced that he wanted to die. When a Lebanese merchant visited Gordon in the evening, the &quot;Ansar&quot; began an artillery bombardment, leading the frightened merchant to suggest that perhaps Gordon ought to dim the lights to avoid drawing enemy fire down on the palace. The merchant recalled Gordon&#x27;s response: &quot;He called up the guard and gave the orders to shoot me if I moved&quot; and ordered all of the lamps in the palace to be lit up as brightly as possible. Gordon defiantly told the merchant: &quot;Go tell all the people of Khartoum that Gordon fears nothing, for God has created him without fear!&quot;

===The capture of Khartoum===
The relief force under General Wolseley, which set out from Wadi Halfa, was divided into two columns at Korti—a 1,200-strong &quot;flying column&quot; or &quot;desert column&quot; of camel-borne troops which would cross the Bayuda desert to reach Metmemma on the Nile and meet Gordon&#x27;s gunboats there, and the main column which would continue to advance along the Nile heading for Berber. The troops reached Korti towards the end of December, the small &quot;Desert Column&quot; reaching Metemma on 20 January 1885, fighting the Battle of Abu Klea on 18 January and Abu Kru (or Gubat) en route. There they found four gunboats which had been sent north by Gordon four months earlier, and prepared them for the trip back up the Nile. When the news of the defeats reached &quot;Ansar&quot; besieging Khartoum, terrible cries of lamentation rose from the besieging force, which led Gordon to guess that the &quot;Ansar&quot; had been defeated in battle and that Wolseley must be close.

On 24 January, two of the steamers, under Sir Charles Wilson, carrying 20 soldiers of the Sussex Regiment wearing red tunics to clearly identify them as British, were sent on a purely reconnaissance mission to Khartoum, with orders from Wolseley not to attempt to rescue Gordon or bring him ammunition or food. On the evening of 24 January 1885, the Mahdi met with his generals, whose leading spokesman was his uncle Muhammad Abd al-Karim, who told him that, with the Nile low and Wolseley close, it was time to either storm Khartoum or retreat. As dawn broke on the morning of 26 January 1885, the &quot;Ansar&quot; regiments, led by their riflemen and followed by their spearmen, marched out of their camps under their black banners.

The &quot;Ansar&quot; began their final attack by storming the city via the gap in the defence caused by the low Nile and after an hour&#x27;s fighting, the starving defenders had abandoned the fight and the city was theirs. The &quot;Ansar&quot; took no prisoners and all of the approximately 7,000 defenders were killed. On arriving at Khartoum on 28 January, the reconnaissance gunboats found that the city had been captured and Gordon had been killed just two days before, coincidentally, two days before his 52nd birthday. Under heavy fire from &quot;Ansar&quot; warriors on the bank, the two steamers turned back downriver.

The British press criticised the relief force for arriving two days late, but the main relief force was nowhere near Khartoum by then and only the reconnaissance party under Sir Charles Wilson on two gunboats had attempted to reach Khartoum, though it was later argued that the Mahdi&#x27;s forces had good intelligence, and if the camel corps had advanced earlier, the final attack on Khartoum would also have come earlier. Finally, the boats sent were not there to relieve Gordon, who was not expected to agree to abandon the city, and the small force and limited supplies on board could have offered scant military support for the besieged in any case.

==Death==
The manner of Gordon&#x27;s death is uncertain, but it was romanticised in a popular painting by George William Joy — &quot;General Gordon&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; (1893, currently in the Leeds City Art Gallery), and again in the film &quot;Khartoum&quot; (1966) with Charlton Heston as Gordon. The most popular account of Gordon&#x27;s death was that he put on his ceremonial gold-braided blue uniform of the Governor-General together with the Pasha&#x27;s red fez and that he went out unarmed, except with his rattan cane, to be cut down by the &quot;Ansar&quot;. This account was very popular with the British press as it contained much Christian imagery with Gordon as a Christlike figure dying passively for the sins of all humanity.

Gordon was apparently killed at the Governor-General&#x27;s palace about an hour before dawn. The Mahdi had given strict orders to his three Khalifas not to kill Gordon. The orders were not obeyed. Gordon&#x27;s Sudanese servants later stated that Gordon for once did not go out armed only with his rattan cane, but also took with him a loaded revolver and his sword, and died in mortal combat fighting the &quot;Ansar&quot;.

Gordon died on the steps of a stairway in the northwestern corner of the palace, where he and his body servant, Agha Khalil Orphali, had been firing at the enemy. Orphali was knocked unconscious and did not see Gordon die. When he woke up again that afternoon, he found Gordon&#x27;s body covered with flies and the head cut off.

A merchant, Bordeini Bey, glimpsed Gordon standing on the palace steps in a white uniform looking into the darkness. The best evidence suggests that Gordon went out to confront the enemy, gunned down several of the &quot;Ansar&quot; with his revolver and, after running out of bullets, drew his sword only to be shot down.

Reference is made to an 1889 account of the General surrendering his sword to a senior Mahdist officer, then being struck and subsequently speared in the side as he rolled down the staircase. Rudolf Slatin, the Austrian governor of Darfur who had been taken prisoner by the &quot;Ansar&quot;, wrote that three soldiers showed him Gordon&#x27;s head at his tent before delivering it to the Mahdi. When Gordon&#x27;s head was unwrapped at the Mahdi&#x27;s feet, he ordered the head transfixed between the branches of a tree &quot;where all who passed it could look in disdain, children could throw stones at it, and the hawks of the desert could sweep and circle above.&quot; His body was desecrated and thrown down a well.

In the hours following Gordon&#x27;s death, an estimated 10,000 civilians and members of the garrison were killed in Khartoum. The massacre was finally halted by orders of the Mahdi. Many of Gordon&#x27;s papers were saved and collected by his two sisters, Helen Clark Gordon, who married Gordon&#x27;s medical colleague in China, Dr. Moffit, and Mary Augusta, and possibly his niece Augusta, who married Gerald Henry Blunt. Gordon&#x27;s papers, as well as some of his grandfather&#x27;s (Samuel Enderby III), were accepted by the British Library around 1937.

The failure to rescue General Gordon&#x27;s force in Sudan was a major blow to Prime Minister Gladstone&#x27;s popularity. Queen Victoria sent him a telegram of rebuke which found its way into the press. Critics said Gladstone had neglected military affairs and had not acted promptly enough to save the besieged Gordon. Critics inverted his acronym, &quot;G.O.M.&quot; (for &quot;Grand Old Man&quot;), to &quot;M.O.G.&quot; (for &quot;Murderer of Gordon&quot;). Gladstone told the Cabinet that the public cared much about Gordon and nothing about the Sudan, so he ordered Wolseley home after learning of Gordon&#x27;s death. Wolseley, who had been led to believe that his expedition was the initial phase of an operation to re-conquer the Sudan, was furious, and in a telegram to Queen Victoria contemptuously called Gladstone &quot;the tradesman who has become a politician&quot;.

In 1885, Gordon achieved the martyrdom he had been seeking at Khartoum as the British press portrayed him as a saintly Christian hero and martyr who had died nobly resisting the Islamic onslaught of the Mahdi. As late as 1901, on the anniversary of Gordon&#x27;s death, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote in a leader (editorial) that Gordon was &quot;that solitary figure holding aloft the flag of England in the face of the dark hordes of Islam&quot;. Gordon&#x27;s death caused a huge wave of national grief all over Britain with 13 March 1885, being set aside as a day of mourning for the &quot;fallen hero of Khartoum&quot;. In a sermon, the Bishop of Chichester stated: &quot;Nations who envied our greatness rejoiced now at our weakness and our inability to protect our trusted servant. Scorn and reproach were cast upon us, and would we plead that it was undeserved? No; the conscience of the nation felt that a strain rested upon it&quot;.

Baring—who deeply disliked Gordon—wrote that because of the &quot;national hysteria&quot; caused by Gordon&#x27;s death, saying anything critical about him at present would be equal to questioning Christianity. Stones were thrown at the windows at 10 Downing Street as Gladstone was denounced as the &quot;Murderer of Gordon&quot;, the Judas figure who betrayed the Christ-like figure of Gordon. The wave of mourning was not just confined to Britain. In New York, Paris, and Berlin, pictures of Gordon appeared in shop windows with black lining as all over the West, the fallen general was seen as a Christ-like man who sacrificed himself resisting the advance of Islam.

Despite the popular demand to &quot;avenge Gordon&quot;, the Conservative government that came into office after the 1885 election did nothing of the sort. The Sudan was judged to be not worth the huge financial costs it would have taken to conquer it, the same conclusion that the Liberals had reached. After Khartoum, the Mahdi established his Islamic state which restored slavery and imposed a very harsh rule that, according to one estimate, caused the deaths of 8 million people between 1885 and 1898. In 1887, the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition under Henry Morton Stanley set out to rescue Dr. Emin Pasha, still holding out in Equatoria against the &quot;Ansar&quot;. Many have seen the attempt to save Emin Pasha, a German doctor-biologist-botanist who had converted from Judaism first to Lutheranism and then (possibly) to Islam, and who had not been particularly famous in Europe until then, as a consolation prize for Gordon.

Egypt had been in the French sphere of influence until 1882 when the British had established control over Egypt. In March 1896, a French force under the command of Jean-Baptiste Marchand left Dakar with the intention of marching across the Sahara with the aim of destroying the &quot;Mahdiyah&quot; state. The French hoped that conquering the Sudan would allow them to lever the British out of Egypt, and thus restore Egypt to the French sphere of influence.

To block the French, a British force under Herbert Kitchener was sent to conquer the &quot;Mahdiyah&quot; state and defeated the &quot;Ansar&quot; at the Battle of Omdurman in 1898. It was thus their rivalry with the French, not a desire to &quot;avenge Gordon&quot;, that led the British government to annex the &quot;Mahdiyah&quot; state in 1898. However, the British public and Kitchener himself saw the expedition as one to &quot;avenge Gordon&quot;. As the Mahdi was long dead, Kitchener had to content himself with blowing up the Mahdi&#x27;s tomb as revenge for Gordon&#x27;s death. The body of the Mahdi was disinterred and beheaded. This symbolic decapitation echoed General Gordon&#x27;s death at the hands of the Mahdist forces in 1885. The headless body of the Mahdi was thrown into the Nile. Lord Kitchener kept the Mahdī&#x27;s skull and it was rumoured that he intended to use it as a drinking cup or ink well.

After the Battle of Omdurman, Kitchener opened a letter from the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, and for the first time learned the real purpose of the expedition had been to keep the French out of the Sudan and that &quot;avenging Gordon&quot; was merely a pretext.

== Personal life ==

=== Personal beliefs ===
Gordon had been born into the Church of England, but he never quite trusted the Anglican Church, instead preferring his own personal brand of Protestantism. In his worn-out state, Gordon had some sort of religious rebirth, leading him to write to his sister Augusta: &quot;Through the workings of Christ in my body by His Body and Blood, the medicine worked. Ever since the realisation of the sacrament, I have been turned upside down&quot;. The eccentric Gordon was very religious, but he departed from Christian orthodoxy on a number of points. Gordon believed in reincarnation. In 1877, he wrote in a letter: &quot;This life is only one of a series of lives which our incarnated part has lived. I have little doubt of our having pre-existed; and that also in the time of our pre-existence we were actively employed. So, therefore, I believe in our active employment in a future life, and I like the thought.&quot; Gordon was an ardent Christian cosmologist, who also believed that the Garden of Eden was on the island of Praslin in the Seychelles. Gordon believed that God&#x27;s throne from which He governed the universe rested upon the earth, which was further surrounded by the firmament.

Gordon believed in both predestination—writing that, &quot;I believe that not a worm is picked up by a bird without the direct intervention of God&quot;—and free will with humans choosing their own fate, writing, &quot;I cannot and do not pretend to reconcile the two&quot;. These religious beliefs mirrored differing aspects of Gordon&#x27;s personality as he believed that he could choose his own fate through the force of his personality and a fatalistic streak often ending his letters with D.V (&quot;Deo volente&quot; – Latin for &quot;God willing&quot;, i.e. whatever God wants will be). Gordon was well-known for sticking Christian tracts onto city walls and to throw them out of a train window. The Romanian historian Eric Tappe described Gordon as a man who developed his own &quot;very personal peculiar variety of Protestantism&quot;.

=== Personality ===
In his book &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot;, Lytton Strachey portrays Gordon in the following manner:

Strachey continued by highlighting the fear his subordinates held for Gordon&#x27;s temper:
===Sexuality===
Gordon&#x27;s charitable work for the boys of Gravesend led to assertions later in the 20th century that he was a homosexual. The &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; described Gordon as a great &quot;boy lover&quot;. Mark Urban wrote:

Gordon never married and is not known to have had a sexual or romantic relationship with anyone. He claimed that his army service and frequent travels to dangerous places made it impossible for him to marry. He could only hurt a potential wife because it was inevitable that he would die in battle. Gordon&#x27;s parents expected him to marry and were disappointed about his lifelong bachelorhood. Urban wrote that the best evidence suggests Gordon was a latent homosexual, whose sexual repression led him to funnelling his aggression into a military career with a special energy. The British historian Denis Judd, wrote about Gordon&#x27;s sexuality:

The American historian Byron Farwell strongly implied in his 1985 book &quot;Eminent Victorian Soldiers&quot; that Gordon was a homosexual, for instance writing of Gordon&#x27;s &quot;unwholesome&quot; interest in the boys he took in to live with him at the Fort House, and his fondness for the company of &quot;handsome&quot; young men.

Gordon, at the age of 14, said that he wished he had been born a eunuch, which has been taken to suggest that he wanted to annihilate all of his sexual desires and, indeed, his sexuality altogether. Together with his sister Augusta, Gordon often prayed to be released from their &quot;vile bodies&quot; in which their spirits were &quot;imprisoned&quot; so that their souls might be joined with God. Faught argued that no-one at the time suspected Gordon of having sexual relations with the legions of teenage boys living with him at the Fort House. Faught also pointed out that the first hints that Gordon might secretly have been having sex with the boys of the Fort House were made by Lytton Strachey in his book &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot; (published 1918) which, in Faught&#x27;s opinion, may have said more about Strachey than it did about Gordon.

Faught maintained that Gordon was a heterosexual whose Christian beliefs led him to maintain his virginity right up to his death, because he believed that sexual intercourse was incompatible with his faith. The frequent references in Gordon&#x27;s letters about his need to resist &quot;temptation&quot; and &quot;subdue the flesh&quot;, Faught argued, related to women rather than men who were &quot;tempting&quot; him. The South African minister Dr. Peter Hammond denied that Gordon was a homosexual, citing the numerous statements made by Gordon condemning homosexuality as an abomination, charging that the claim that Gordon was a homosexual was a theory with no foundation in fact. The British historian Paul Mersh has suggested that Gordon was not a homosexual, but rather his awkwardness with women was due to Asperger syndrome, which made it extremely difficult for him to express his feelings for women properly.

===Charity work===

Gordon returned to Britain and commanded the Royal Engineers&#x27; project around Gravesend, Kent, to erect forts for the defense of the River Thames. After he arrived in Britain, Gordon announced to the press that he &quot;did not want to board the tram of the world&quot; and asked to be left alone. Gordon disapproved of the forts he was building at the mouth of Thames to guard against a possible French invasion, regarding them as expensive and useless. When the Duke of Cambridge, the Army&#x27;s commander, visited one of the forts under construction and praised Gordon for his work, he received the reply: &quot;I had nothing to do with it, sir; it was built regardless of my opinion, and, in fact, I entirely disapprove of its arrangement and position&quot;. Gordon&#x27;s father was against his son working in Chinese service, an estrangement that had not been settled at the time of his death, and Gordon felt immense guilt that his father had died before they were reconciled.

Following the death of his father, he undertook extensive social work in Gravesend, feeding homeless boys whom he found begging on the street while also attempting to find them homes and jobs. Many of the &quot;scuttlers,&quot; as Gordon fondly called the homeless boys, were lodged at his own home, the Fort House. Together with Mrs. Sarah Mackley, his housekeeper, he adapted two rooms at Fort House to serve as classrooms and basic needs resource rooms for boys living on the streets. He also rented a small house in East Terrace for working boys to be taught for free. Gordon&#x27;s closest friends were a couple, Frederick and Octavia Freese, whose son Edward, became Gordon&#x27;s surrogate son. Persuaded by his friends in 1867, he became a trustee for the local Ragged school committee. Before 1870, there was no universal school system in Britain, and the Ragged Schools were a network of privately-funded schools that gave a free education to children whose parents were too poor to afford the school fees. Outside of the Fort House were graffito written on the wall by one of the evidently less-educated boys that read: &quot;God Bless the Kernel&quot;. Another &quot;scuttler&quot; later recalled: &quot;He made me feel, first of all, the meaning of the phrase, the Goodness of God. Goodness become to me, through Gordon, the most desirable of ideas...We were under the spell of Gordon&#x27;s personality. We lived in the magic of his mystery-enchanted&quot;.

Octavia Freese published a book in 1894 about his charity work and Christian beliefs. The council subsequently acquired the gardens of his official residence, Fort House (now a museum), for the town.

His favourite books were &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; by Thomas à Kempis, &quot;Christ Mystical&quot; by Joseph Hall, and the poem &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; by John Henry Newman.

Every year, Gordon gave away about 90% of his annual income of £3,000 () to charity. Gordon did not enjoy his celebrity status, and though extremely charismatic, he only kept a limited circle of friends and found dealing with strangers difficult. A colleague recalled that Gordon&#x27;s time at Gravesend was the &quot;most peaceful and happy of his life&quot;, but Gordon was often bored, and constantly asked the War Office for an assignment to somewhere dangerous. Gordon often spoke nostalgically of his service in China, and wished he could return to that country.

==Memorials==



News of Gordon&#x27;s death caused an outpouring of public grief across Britain. A memorial service, conducted by the Bishop of Newcastle, was held at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 14 March. The Lord Mayor of London opened a public subscription to raise funds for a permanent memorial to Gordon; this eventually materialised as the Gordon Boys Home, now Gordon&#x27;s School, in West End, Woking.

Days after Gordon&#x27;s death at a meeting on March 24, 1885, Reverend Edward Stuart, a missionary in Africa, proposed that a Gordon Memorial Mission be built in the Eastern Sudan in honour of Major-General Charles George Gordon, killed by the Ansar at Khartoum in January. Stuart&#x27;s proposal was met with cheers and overwhelming support by the hundreds of people present.

Statues were erected in Trafalgar Square, London, in Chatham, Gravesend, Melbourne (Australia), and Khartoum. Southampton, where Gordon had stayed with his sister, Augusta, in Rockstone Place before his departure to the Sudan, erected a memorial in Porter&#x27;s Mead, now Queen&#x27;s Park, near the town&#x27;s docks. On 16 October 1885, the structure was unveiled; it comprises a stone base on which there are four polished red Aberdeen granite columns, about twenty feet high. The columns are surmounted by carved capitals supporting a cross. The pedestal bears the arms of the Gordon clan and of the borough of Southampton, and also Gordon&#x27;s name in Chinese. Around the base is an inscription referring to Gordon as a soldier, philanthropist, and administrator and mentions those parts of the world in which he served, closing with a quotation from his last letter to his sisters: &quot;I am quite happy, thank God! and, like Lawrence, I have tried to do my duty.&quot; The memorial is a Grade II listed building.

Gordon&#x27;s memory, as well as his work in supervising the town&#x27;s riverside fortifications, is commemorated in Gravesend; the embankment of the Riverside Leisure Area is known as the Gordon Promenade, while Khartoum Place lies just to the south. Located in the town centre of his birthplace of Woolwich is General Gordon Square, formerly known as General Gordon Place until a major urban landscaped area was developed and the road name changed. In addition, one of the first Woolwich Free Ferry vessels was named &quot;Gordon&quot; in his memory.

A tall, elegant gas lamp fitted with a plaque commemorating Gordon stands in Cheltenham. Funded by public subscription and erected in 1887, it was converted to electricity in 1900 and refurbished by the Cheltenham Civic Society in 2013 to its present working state. A tablet fitted to the base reads, &#x27;In memory of Major-General Charles George Gordon CBRE 1833-1885.&#x27;

In 1886, the &quot;Western Hospital for Fistula, Piles and other Diseases of the Rectum&quot;, at 278 Vauxhall Bridge Road, and backing onto Vincent Square London, was renamed in honour of Gordon. It underwent a series of name changes until 1941 when it moved to its current location in Bloomburg Street, Westminster, as the Gordon Hospital. Shut for the closing years of World War II, it reopened in 1947 under the same name, but serving as a psychiatric unit operated by the Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust.

In 1888, a statue of General Gordon by Hamo Thornycroft was erected in Trafalgar Square, London, exactly halfway between the two fountains. It was removed in 1943. In a House of Commons speech on 5 May 1948, then opposition leader Winston Churchill spoke out in favour of the statue&#x27;s return to its original location: &quot;Is the right honorable Gentleman [the Minister of Works] aware that General Gordon was not only a military commander, who gave his life for his country, but, in addition, was considered very widely throughout this country as a model of a Christian hero, and that very many cherished ideals are associated with his name? Would not the right honorable Gentleman consider whether this statue [...] might not receive special consideration [...]? General Gordon was a figure outside and above the ranks of military and naval commanders.&quot; However, in 1953 the statue, minus a large slice of its pedestal, was reinstalled on the Victoria Embankment, in front of the newly-built Ministry of Defence main buildings.

An identical statue by Thornycroft—but with the pedestal intact—is located in a small park called Gordon Reserve, near Parliament House in Melbourne, Australia.

The Corps of Royal Engineers, Gordon&#x27;s own Corps, commissioned a statue of Gordon on a camel. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1890 and then erected in Brompton Barracks, Chatham, the home of the Royal School of Military Engineering, where it still stands. Much later, a second casting was made. In 1902, it was placed at the junction of St Martin&#x27;s Lane and Charing Cross Road in London. In 1904, it was moved to Khartoum, where it stood at the intersection of Gordon Avenue and Victoria Avenue, 200 metres south of the new palace that had been built in 1899. It was removed in 1958, shortly after the Sudan became independent. This is the figure which, since April 1959, stands at the Gordon&#x27;s School in Woking.

Gordon&#x27;s Tomb (in fact a cenotaph), which was carved by Frederick William Pomeroy, lies in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London.

The Church Missionary Society (CMS) work in Sudan was undertaken under the name of the Gordon Memorial Mission. This was a very evangelical branch of CMS and was able to start work in Sudan in 1900 as soon as the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium took control after the fall of Khartoum in 1899. In 1885, at a meeting in London, £3,000 were allocated to a Gordon Memorial Mission in Sudan.

In the Presidential Palace in Khartoum (built in 1899), in the west wing on the ground floor, there was, at least until 1936, a stone slab against the wall on the left side of the main corridor when coming from the main entrance with the text: &quot;Charles George Gordon died—26 Jan 1885&quot;, on the spot where Gordon was killed, at the foot of the stairs in the old Governor-General&#x27;s Palace (built around 1850). A memorial plaque was still present as of 2014.

==Media portrayals and legacy==

Charlton Heston played Gordon in the 1966 epic film &quot;Khartoum&quot;, which deals with the siege of Khartoum. Laurence Olivier played Muhammad Ahmad. The British historian Alex von Tunzelmann criticised the film for portraying Gordon and the Mahdi regularly meeting and as &quot;frères ennemis&quot;, though she added that it is true that Gordon and the Mahdi did exchange letters.

For the six months after the British public learned of Gordon&#x27;s death, newspapers and journals published hundreds of articles celebrating Gordon as a &quot;saint&quot;. The American historian Cynthia Behrman wrote that the articles all commented upon &quot;Gordon&#x27;s religious faith, his skill with native peoples, his fearlessness in the face of danger (a recurrent motif is Gordon&#x27;s habit of leading his troops into battle armed with no more than a rattan cane), his honor, his resourcefulness, his graciousness to subordinates, his impatience with cant and hypocrisy, his hatred of glory and honors, his dislike of lionization and social rewards, and on and on. One begins to wonder whether the man had any faults at all&quot;. &quot;The reading public wanted heroes, it wanted to read about one lone Englishmen sacrificing himself for glory, honour, God, and the Empire.&quot;

Such was the popularity of Gordon that the first critical book by a British author was not published until 1908, when Baring—by this time raised to the peerage as Viscount Cromer—published his autobiography, which was notable as the first British book to portray Gordon in an unflattering manner, though Lord Cromer also tried to be fair and emphasised what he felt were Gordon&#x27;s positive, as well as his negative, traits. About the charge that if only Gladstone had listened to Gordon, the disaster would have been avoided, Cromer wrote that in the course of one month, he received five telegrams from Gordon offering his advice, each one of which completely contradicted the previous telegram, leading Cromer to charge that Gordon was too a figure to hold command.

As a young man, Winston Churchill shared in the national consensus that Gordon was one of Britain&#x27;s greatest heroes. During a meeting in 1898 in Cairo where Churchill interviewed Baring to gather material for his 1899 book &quot;The River War&quot;, Baring challenged Churchill about his belief that Gordon was a hero. After his conversation with Baring, Churchill wrote: &quot;Of course there is no doubt that Gordon as a political figure was absolutely hopeless. He was so erratic, capricious, utterly unreliable, his mood changed so often, his temper was abominable, he was frequently drunk, and yet with all that, he had a tremendous sense of honour and great abilities&quot;.

Many biographies have been written of Gordon, most of them highly hagiographic, such as the one by William Butler. The British sinologist Demetrius Charles Boulger published a biography of Gordon in 1896 which depicted him as a staunch patriot and a Christian of immense virtue who displayed superhuman courage in the face of danger. By contrast, Gordon is one of the four subjects discussed critically in &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot; by Lytton Strachey, one of the first texts about Gordon that portrays some of his characteristics which Strachey regards as weaknesses. Notably, Strachey emphasises the claims of Charles Chaillé-Long that Gordon was an alcoholic, an accusation dismissed by later writers like Alan Moorehead and Charles Chenevix Trench.

Strachey, a member of the Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals, depicted Gordon as a ludicrous figure, a bad-tempered, deranged egomaniac with a nasty habit of knocking out Arabs whenever he was unhappy, and who led himself into disaster. Even more devastatingly, Strachey depicted Gordon as a monumental hypocrite, noting the contrast between Gordon&#x27;s lofty Christian ideas of love, compassion, charity, grace, and hope vs. a career full of hate, war, carnage, death, and destruction. Strachey ended his essay on Gordon on a cynical note: &quot;At any rate, it all ended very happily—in a glorious slaughter of twenty-thousand Arabs, a vast addition to the British Empire and a step in the Peerage for Sir Evelyn Baring&quot;.

Long after his death, and despite the popularity of Strachey&#x27;s essay in &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot;, the appeal of the Gordon legend lived on. As late as 1933, the French historian Pierre Crabitès wrote in his book (&quot;Gordon, the Sudan and Slavery&quot;) that as a Frenchman, the Gordon legend had meant nothing to him when he began researching his book, but after examining all of the historical evidence, he could not help but admire Gordon, who &quot;died as he lived, a Christian, a gentleman, and a soldier&quot;.

In the 20th century, many British military leaders came to have a critical view of Gordon, with Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery writing that Gordon was &quot;unfit for independent command, mentally unbalanced, a fanatic, self-imposed martyr&quot;, adding that he should never have been sent to the Sudan and the Gladstone–Gordon relationship was a case study in dysfunctional civil–military relations. In 1953, the British novelist Charles Beatty published a Gordon biography, &quot;His Country was the World: A Study of Gordon of Khartoum&quot;, which focused on Gordon&#x27;s religious faith, but for the first time noted what a tormented figure Gordon was: a man of deeply felt Christian convictions, full of guilt and self-loathing over his own sinfulness and inability to live up to his own impossibly high standards over what a Christian should be and desperately longing to do something to expiate his sinfulness. Like Strachey, Beatty found Gordon a ridiculous figure, but unlike Strachey, who had nothing but contempt for Gordon, Beatty&#x27;s approach was a compassionate one, arguing that Gordon&#x27;s many acts of charity and self-sacrifice were attempts to love others since he was unable to love himself.

Another attempt to debunk Gordon was Anthony Nutting&#x27;s &quot;Gordon, Martyr &amp; Misfit&quot; (1966). Nutting&#x27;s book was noteworthy as the first book to argue that Gordon had a death wish. Nutting noted that Gordon had often recklessly exposed himself to Russian fire while fighting in the Crimea and stated he hoped to die in battle against the Russians before leaving for the Crimea. On the basis of such statements and actions, Nutting argued that Gordon&#x27;s suicidal courage of going into battle armed only with his rattan cane, which so impressed the Victorian public, reflected darker desires. Nutting made the controversial claim that the basis of Gordon&#x27;s death wish was that he was gay, noting that Gordon never married, is not known to have had a relationship with any women, and often wished that he had been born a eunuch, which strongly suggested that Gordon wished to have no sexual desires at all.

Nutting contended that the conflict between Gordon&#x27;s devoutly-held Christian ideals and his sexuality made Gordon deeply ashamed of himself and he attempted to expiate his wretched, sinful nature by seeking a glorious death in battle. Behrman wrote that the first part of Nutting&#x27;s thesis, that Gordon had a death wish, is generally accepted by historians, but the second part, that Gordon was homosexual, is still the subject of much debate. In his &quot;Mission to KhartumThe Apotheosis of General Gordon&quot; (1969), John Marlowe portrays Gordon as &quot;a colourful eccentric—a soldier of fortune, a skilled guerrilla leader, a religious crank, a minor philanthropist, a gadfly buzzing about on the outskirts of public life&quot;, who would have been no more than a footnote in today&#x27;s history books, had it not been for &quot;his mission to Khartoum and the manner of his death&quot;, which were elevated by the media &quot;into a kind of contemporary Passion Play&quot;.

More balanced biographies are &quot;Charley Gordon: An Eminent Victorian Reassessed&quot; (1978) by Charles Chenevix Trench and &quot;Gordon: The Man Behind the Legend&quot; (1993) by John Pollock. Mark Urban argued that Gordon&#x27;s final stand was &quot;significant&quot; because it was &quot;a perversion of the democratic process&quot; as he &quot;managed to subvert government policy&quot;, making the beginning of a new era where decision-makers had to consider the power of media. In &quot;KhartoumThe Ultimate Imperial Adventure&quot; (2005), Michael Asher puts Gordon&#x27;s works in the Sudan in a broad context. Asher concludes: &quot;He did not save the country from invasion or disaster, but among the British heroes of all ages, there is perhaps no other who stands out so prominently as an individualist, a man ready to die for his principles. Here was one man among men who did not do what he was told, but what he believed to be right. In a world moving inexorably towards conformity, it would be well to remember Gordon of Khartoum.&quot;

Gordon also left a legacy in China and Sudan as well, two nations where he spent large parts of his career. His legacy in China has been influenced by subsequent political developments, as the Qing dynasty was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution and replaced by a republic. This eventually led to the Warlord Era and the Chinese Civil War which saw the communists defeat the nationalists and establish control over China. Due to many aspects of the Taiping ideology resembling Chinese communism, the Taipings are treated sympathetically by Chinese historians who portray them as prototypical communists, with Hong Xiuquan foreshadowing Mao. As such, Gordon&#x27;s role in suppressing the rebellion has caused his reputation to suffer in China, in addition to his role as a general in service of the Manchu-dominated Qing government, which systematically oppressed the Han Chinese majority.

No monuments to Gordon exist in China today, though the British journalist Rob Stallard noted that the modest Gordon would have no doubt wanted it that way. In a 2008 article, Stallard argued that Chinese historiography has largely neglected Gordon, which Stallard felt was undeserved. In the article, Stallard pointed to the egalitarianistic attitudes displayed by Gordon towards the Chinese, and argued that if Chinese historians paid closer attention to the activities of Gordon in China, it would improve Anglo-Chinese relations. In Sudan, Sudanese historians have traditionally focused on the Mahdi and his rebellion, with Gordon only being relevant as the enemy general during the Siege of Khartoum, and his abolitionist work largely ignored.

In 1982, a documentary on Gordon&#x27;s life was written and presented by the actor and historian Robert Hardy, entitled &quot;Gordon of Khartoum&quot;.

<text>The Fitzroy Football Club is an Australian rules football club currently competing in the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA). Formed in 1883 to represent the inner-Melbourne municipality of Fitzroy, the club is based at the W. T. Peterson Community Oval in Fitzroy North. The club nickname is the Roys, having previously been the Maroons (until 1938), Gorillas (1938–1957) and Lions (1957–1996). Since 1975, the club&#x27;s colours have been red, blue and gold.

Fitzroy was established as a member of the Victorian Football Association (VFA), winning one premiership in that competition. In 1897, it was a foundation member of the breakaway Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest senior professional league in Victoria and later, as the Australian Football League (AFL), in Australia. Fitzroy was one of the most successful clubs over the league&#x27;s first three decades, contesting 19 finals series and winning a league-high seven premierships in that time. However, success was limited thereafter, and its last seventy years yielded only one premiership from eleven finals appearances. The club suffered persistent financial losses through the 1980s and 1990s, culminating in being placed into administration in 1996, and its AFL operations were merged into those of the Brisbane Bears, who became the Brisbane Lions from 1997.

Fitzroy came out of administration in 1998, and formed sponsor partnerships with local amateur clubs over the next ten years. Since 2009, the club has competed in the VAFA in its own right, and as of 2025 plays in the Premier B division.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
The Fitzroy Football Club was formed at a meeting at the Brunswick Hotel on 26 September 1883, at a time when Melbourne&#x27;s population was rapidly increasing. The Victorian Football Association (VFA) made changes to their rules, allowing Fitzroy to join as the seventh club in 1884, playing in the maroon and blue colours of the local Normanby Junior Football Club.

=== VFA ===

They quickly became one of the most successful clubs, drawing large crowds to their home at the Brunswick Street Oval in Edinburgh Gardens, and consistently in the top four and winning the VFA premiership in 1895.

Fitzroy&#x27;s season-by-season records throughout its thirteen seasons at VFA level are given below. (Under VFA rules at the time, only goals were counted to the total team score).

=== VFL ===

In 1897, Fitzroy were one of the eight clubs who broke away from the VFA to form the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Despite winning only four games and finishing sixth in the first season, the Maroons, as they were then known, won the premiership the following year, winning the VFL&#x27;s first &quot;Grand Final&quot; against Essendon. Fitzroy was the most successful club in the first 10 years of the VFL, winning four premierships and finishing runners-up on three occasions. Despite internal problems after the 1906 season which led to the players and set the club back for several seasons, the 1913 team won the flag after winning 16 of 18 matches in the home-and-away season, earning the nickname &quot;Unbeatables&quot;. In contrast, the 1916 Fitzroy team only won 2 home-and-away matches and finished last in a competition reduced by the effects of World War I to four teams. All four teams qualified for the finals, and Fitzroy won their next three games to win one of the strangest VFL premierships; this is the first and only time a club that finished last on the ladder won the premiership in the same year.

=== Between the wars ===

The Maroons won their seventh premiership in 1922, a season which included four very rough games against eventual runners-up Collingwood. However, after this their fortunes waned, and they did not make the finals at all from 1925 to 1942. During this time, highlights for the club were individual achievements of their players, especially Haydn Bunton Sr. Originally a source of controversy, lured to Fitzroy with an illegal £222 payment, and subsequently not allowed to play in the 1930 season, Bunton became one of the game&#x27;s greatest players, winning three Brownlow Medals while at Fitzroy. Brownlow Medals were also won by Wilfred Smallhorn and Dinny Ryan, while Jack Moriarty set many goalkicking records. It was during this time that the Maroons became known as the Gorillas.

=== Post-war ===
Football was less affected by World War II than it had been in 1916, and by 1944 was starting to return to its normal level. It was in this year, under captain-coach Fred Hughson, that the Gorillas won their eighth VFL flag against Richmond in front of a capacity crowd at Junction Oval.

However, it was also to be their last senior premiership, as the club, which became known as the Lions in 1957, entered one of the least successful periods any VFL/AFL club has had. The club finished in the bottom three 11 times in the 1960s and 1970s, including three wooden spoons in four years between 1963 and 1966. The club won only a single game throughout 1963 and 1964 – known as the Miracle Match when it defeated eventual premiers in Round 10, 1963 – but its 1964 season was winless, and as of 2023 stands as the only winless season by any club in the men&#x27;s competition since 1950. Nevertheless, the club continued to produce great individual players over this period, including Brownlow Medallists Allan Ruthven and Kevin Murray.

By the mid-1960s, Fitzroy&#x27;s traditional home ground, the Brunswick Street Oval was in a state of disrepair. However, the ground managers were the Fitzroy Cricket Club. The Football Club had to pay the Cricket Club to use the ground. Despite pressure from the Lions and other VFL clubs, the Cricket Club refused to make the needed upgrades. The Fitzroy City Council, despite repeated requests from the Football Club, also refused to help, even rejecting the idea of a $400,000 loan to Fitzroy Football Club, and a 40-year lease of the ground so they could make some repairs.

The football club put forward various ideas to try and change the situation, including the amalgamation of the Football and Cricket Clubs to form one club as in the manner of the Carlton Social Club. The Cricket Club held the liquor licence and managed the ground, and it was thought that a combined club could more efficiently manage funds. With a stake in the ground, the football club could have better agitated for improvements to the ground by sourcing funds from other organisations such as the VFL. However, the Cricket Club rejected the idea outright. The club also considered leaving Brunswick Street, and in 1962 it appealed to the Preston Council for a 40-year lease of the Preston City Oval, which was rejected.

It was only when the Council Health Officer condemned the change rooms at the Brunswick Street Oval in 1966 and negotiations broke down between the council, (who offered a 21-year lease) and the football club, that the Fitzroy Football Club was forced to find another ground. They had held discussions with the Northcote and Preston VFA clubs and also had approached the Heidelberg Council about relocating to the Olympic Training Ground. From 1967 to 1969, the club moved their home games to Carlton&#x27;s Princes Park while keeping their training and administration at the Brunswick Street Oval. Further problems with the Cricket Club and the high cost of rent imposed by Carlton saw Fitzroy move to the Junction Oval in 1970, where they had a short-lived promising start to the decade. This was followed by a night premiership win in 1978 and a then-League-record score of 36.22 (238) and greatest winning margin of 190 points in 1979. However, Fitzroy&#x27;s most significant post-war success was in the early &#x27;80s, when the Lions made the finals four times, culminating in a preliminary final appearance in 1986. This success occurred under the coaching of Robert Walls and David Parkin, with players such as 1981 Brownlow Medallist Bernie Quinlan, Ron Alexander, Garry Wilson, Gary Pert and Paul Roos.

The club was evicted from Junction Oval at the end of 1984 after a fifteen-year tenure, and entered another nomadic period of existence. It played its home games at Victoria Park, sharing it with in 1985 and 1986, then at Princes Park, sharing it with Carlton from 1987 until 1993; In 1994, Fitzroy then began playing its home matches at the Western Oval, sharing the venue with Footscray, as it sought a better financial arrangement than it had received at its previous home Princes Park. and over the same time it moved through several different training and administrative bases, spending time first at the Northcote Park in Northcote, then later Lake Oval in South Melbourne and Bulleen Park in Bulleen.

=== Fitzroy&#x27;s time in the AFL ends ===

Talk of the death of the club due to financial troubles occurred as early as 1986. In 1989 the directors agreed to amalgamation with equally troubled Footscray to form the Fitzroy Bulldogs, but a fightback from Footscray supporters, in which almost two million dollars was raised in three weeks, averted the merger. At other times, joining with Melbourne or relocating to Brisbane was suggested. As well as trying several fund-raising ventures, the Lions experimented with playing four home matches in Tasmania in 1991 and 1992 to avoid a takeover bid by the Brisbane Bears but lost money in the process. In 1994, the club moved its home matches to Western Oval, its fourth match-day home ground in 10 years. Amid uncertainties about the financial future of the club, its on-field performances continued to deteriorate, to the point where the Lions finished last by a long way in 1995 and 1996, winning just three matches in those seasons combined. With financial and on–field performance issues plaguing the club and with due to enter the AFL in 1997 requiring a team to either merge or fold to make way for them, the writing for Fitzroy was on the wall.

On 28 June 1996, the Nauru Insurance Company, a creditor of the Fitzroy Football Club, appointed Michael Brennan to administer the affairs of the Fitzroy Football Club to ensure a loan of A$1.25 million was to be repaid. During the 1996 season, there were fears that the club would collapse in mid-season due to its lack of cash. This was averted when the AFL guaranteed funds to Fitzroy to allow the club to continue in the competition for the remainder of 1996.

Fitzroy had been in merger discussions with several teams, but discussions were most advanced with North Melbourne. By the beginning of July 1996, the club had agreed to arrangements to become the North Fitzroy Kangaroos Football Club. Negotiations for elements such as club colours, guernsey and song were to be settled by the morning of 4 July by the Fitzroy board.

However, later that afternoon the administrator of Fitzroy, who had been appointed to temporarily replace the Fitzroy board, agreed to merge the club&#x27;s AFL operations with the Brisbane Bears, with the agreement of the AFL commission and a majority vote of the AFL&#x27;s constituent clubs. The Brisbane Bears would then change their name to Brisbane Bears-Fitzroy Football Club (trading as Brisbane Lions), playing at The Gabba in the Brisbane suburb of Woolloongabba. The arrangement ensured that all creditors were repaid, at least eight Fitzroy players were to be selected by the Brisbane Lions before the 1996 National Draft and three Fitzroy representatives were to be on Brisbane&#x27;s 11-member board. None of the three Fitzroy representatives, Laurie Serafini, David Lucas and Ken Levy, chosen to serve on Brisbane&#x27;s board, were Fitzroy directors at that time.

Those involved have different opinions on why the merger with North Melbourne was rejected, despite negotiations being so far advanced and indeed concluded on the morning of 4 July. The other AFL club presidents rejected the North Melbourne-Fitzroy merger by a vote of 14–1. It was commonly thought, and claimed by then Richmond president Leon Daphne, that an all-Victorian merge would create a superteam with on-field and off-field strength out of all proportion to the rest of the league. Not only would North Melbourne go on to the 1996 premiership, the merged team had proposed to take a 50-player senior list into the 1997 season. This is compared with the Brisbane Lions bid, which proposed a 44-player senior list for 1997, and did not have the potential off-field strength of an all-Victorian merge. Then North Melbourne CEO Greg Miller has accused the AFL of contriving the two bids in this manner to manufacture a result which would fulfil its strategic direction to strengthen the game in Queensland. Additionally, then North Melbourne vice-president Peter de Rauch believes that his club&#x27;s decision not to include Fitzroy president Dyson Hore-Lacy on the board of the merged club was a catalyst for the temporary unravelling of negotiations between the clubs, allowing the appointment of the administrator and keeping the Brisbane Bears involved in negotiations.

During this time, senior coach Mick Nunan resigned after Fitzroy&#x27;s game against Essendon on 6 July and was replaced by Alan McConnell for his second stint in just twelve months. With eight rounds to go until the end of the season, Fitzroy&#x27;s on field performances continued to deteriorate to the point where the team was thrashed week in, week out. In Round 21, 48,884 people attended the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on 25 August 1996 for Fitzroy&#x27;s last ever game in Melbourne as part of the AFL competition. They witnessed the Lions being defeated by 151 points, the second greatest loss in the club&#x27;s history: Richmond 28.19 (187) defeated Fitzroy 5.6 (36). The club played its final VFL/AFL game the following week on 1 September against at Subiaco Oval, losing by 86 points.

=== Post-AFL ===

;On-field
The original Fitzroy Football Club came out of administration after its AFL operations were absorbed by Brisbane, in late 1998. The shareholders voted to continue the club, and Fitzroy then developed a partnership with the Coburg Lions in the VFL. Coburg were known as the Coburg-Fitzroy Lions for just over a season (from August 1999 until the end of 2000). However, when Coburg entered into an affiliation with the AFL&#x27;s Richmond Football Club, the Fitzroy connection was abandoned.

Fitzroy began a sponsorship arrangement with the Fitzroy Reds (formerly University Reds) in the Victorian Amateur Football Association and the Fitzroy Junior Football Club in the Yarra Junior Football League. Both wear the old Fitzroy jumper, play the old theme song, and play from Brunswick Street Oval in the heart of Fitzroy. In December 2008, at the instigation of the then Fitzroy (University) Reds president Craig Little, the University Reds Football Club (known as the &#x27;Fitzroy&#x27; Reds from 1997) transferred all its assets to the Fitzroy Football Club (formed 1883). The university (Fitzroy) Reds terminated its membership of the VAFA and was wound up as an incorporated company and football club. By special dispensation from the VAFA, the Fitzroy Football Club then replaced the Fitzroy [University] Reds in D1 of the VAFA from the 2009 season, fielding a senior and reserves side, as well as two Under-19 sides and a Club 18 side. All the teams were made up mainly of Fitzroy Reds personnel. Dyson Hore-Lacy, chairman of Fitzroy in the AFL in 1996, automatically became chairman of the Club in the VAFA.

Fitzroy lost in the VAFA D1 Grand Final to Rupertswood in 2009, but as a Grand Finalist was promoted to C-Grade for the 2010 season. At the beginning of the 2011 season, Fitzroy appointed Tim Bell as their new senior coach following the resignation of Simon Taylor. Tim Bell resigned for personal reasons at the end of 2011 and assistant coach Michael Pickering, a former AFL player with the Richmond and Melbourne Football Clubs was appointed as coach for the 2012 season. Having reached the Premier C Grand Final at the end of 2012 season, Fitzroy was promoted to Premier B for season 2013 which coincided with the club&#x27;s 130th birthday.

In 2015 the club initiated in a partnership with the Australian Catholic University to start fielding a women&#x27;s team in the VWFL under the name of Fitzroy-ACU. They played their debut season in the same year.
The interest grew after the first year of women&#x27;s Fitzroy footy, growing numbers within the women&#x27;s league. This enabled the club to enter another women&#x27;s team into the VWFL, in the North West division.
Both teams were hoping to make finals in 2016.

In 2018, Fitzroy won both the VAFA Premier C and the VAFA Premier C reserves grand finals.

== Relationship with the Brisbane Lions ==
Fitzroy Football Club improved its relationship with the Brisbane Lions in the ten years from 1999 to 2009. Brisbane have used the letters BBFFC printed below the back of the neck of the club&#x27;s guernseys from 2002 to reflect the members vote to change their club&#x27;s name to Brisbane Bears-Fitzroy Football Club (trading as Brisbane Lions) towards the end of 1996, in accordance with the Deed of Arrangement between Fitzroy Football Club and Brisbane Bears. In 2003, the then-Fitzroy Reds played the curtain-raiser at the MCG when the Brisbane Lions met the Collingwood Magpies in the AFL Heritage Round, and from 2008 Brisbane started wearing a version of Fitzroy&#x27;s AFL guernsey with red instead of maroon in most matches played in Victoria, consistent with Fitzroy&#x27;s most recent colours.

Relationships between Fitzroy and Brisbane were strained in late 2009, when Brisbane announced that it was adopting a new logo for season 2010 and beyond, which contravened Section 7.2 c) of the Deed of Arrangement between Fitzroy and Brisbane. The new logo, a lion&#x27;s head facing forward, replaced the former Fitzroy logo of a passant lion with a football.

On 22 December 2009, Fitzroy lodged a Statement of Claim with the Supreme Court of Victoria, seeking an order that the Brisbane Lions be restrained from using as its logo, the new logo or any other logo other than &#x27;the Fitzroy lion logo&#x27;, in line with Brisbane&#x27;s legal obligations as specified in the Deed of Arrangement, including their obligation to use the Fitzroy logo in perpetuity. On 15 July 2010, the two clubs reached a settlement, agreeing that the Fitzroy logo symbolically represents the historic deal between Brisbane and Fitzroy, and represents the Brisbane Lions in the AFL. Fitzroy agreed to a compromise whereby Brisbane would use both the old and new logos alongside each other in an official capacity for the next 14 years on all official club stationery and club publications, as well as the Lions&#x27; official website for the shorter period of seven years.

After immense pressure from both Brisbane and Fitzroy fans, Brisbane returned to using the old logo on its playing guernseys from 2015, but the new logo will remain for corporate purposes.

Brisbane have since maintained and renewed strong ties with Fitzroy. They sponsor a male and female Fitzroy player each year, conduct coaching workshops for Fitzroy, frequently invite the Fitzroy juniors to form a guard of honour for Victorian games, have many Fitzroy past players and representatives as elected board members, and both celebrate a long and rich shared history.

<text>Michael Babatunde Olatunji (April 7, 1927 – April 6, 2003) was a Nigerian drummer, educator, social activist, and recording artist.

==Early life ==

Olatunji was born in the village of Ajido, near Badagry, Lagos State, in southwestern Nigeria. A member of the Ogu (Egun) people, Olatunji was introduced to traditional African music at an early age. His name, Bàbátúndé, means &#x27;father has returned&#x27;, because he was born two months after his father, Zannu, died, and Olatunji was considered to be a reincarnation of him. His father was a local fisherman who was about to rise to the rank of chieftain, and his mother was a potter. Olatunji grew up speaking the Gun (Ogu/Egun) and Yoruba languages. His maternal grandmother and a great-grandmother were priestesses of the Vodun and Ogu religions, and they worshipped the Vodun, such as Kori, the goddess of fertility.

Due to his father&#x27;s premature death, from an early age he was groomed to take the position as chief. When he was 12, he realized that he did not want to become a chieftain. He read in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; magazine about the Rotary International Foundation&#x27;s scholarship program, and applied for it. His application was successful and he went to the United States in 1950 to attend Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia.

==Education==
In Morehouse, Olatunji became good friends with Morehouse College Glee Club director Dr. Wendell P. Whalum. He never sang in the Glee Club, but collaborated with Whalum on a staple of the choir&#x27;s repertoire, &quot;Betelehemu&quot;, a Nigerian Christmas carol. After graduating, he went on to New York University to study public administration. There, he started a small percussion group to earn money on the side while he continued his studies.

==Career==
After hearing Olatunji perform with the 66 piece Radio City Music Hall orchestra Columbia Records signed Olatunji to the Columbia label in 1958. One year later he released his first of six records on the Columbia label, called &quot;Drums of Passion&quot;. &quot;Drums of Passion&quot; became a major hit and remains in print; it introduced many Americans to world music. Drums of Passion also served as the band&#x27;s name.

Olatunji won a following among jazz musicians, by infusing Nigerian rhythms with elements drawn from Ghanaian and Afro-Caribbean traditions. Most notably creating a strong relationship with John Coltrane, with whose help he founded the Olatunji Center for African Culture in Harlem. This was the site of Coltrane&#x27;s final recorded performance in 1967. Coltrane wrote the composition &quot;Tunji&quot; on the 1962 album &quot;Coltrane&quot; in dedication to him. Olatunji recorded with many other prominent musicians (often credited as &quot;Michael Olatunji&quot;), including Cannonball Adderley (on his 1961 &quot;African Waltz&quot; album), Horace Silver, Quincy Jones, Pee Wee Ellis, Stevie Wonder, Randy Weston, and with Max Roach and Abbey Lincoln on the pivotal &quot;Freedom Now Suite&quot; aka &quot;We Insist!&quot;, and with Grateful Dead member Mickey Hart on his Grammy winning &quot;Planet Drum&quot; projects. He is also mentioned in the lyrics of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I Shall Be Free,&quot; recorded for the album &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot;. He appeared in the second season episode &quot;Olatunji – An African in New York&quot; of the CBC television show Quest broadcast May 6, 1962, a series which also starred Bob Dylan in an episode from March 10, 1964.

In 1969, Carlos Santana had a major hit with his cover version of &quot;Jin-go-lo-ba&quot; from Olatunji&#x27;s first album, which Santana recorded on his debut album, &quot;Santana&quot;, as &quot;Jingo&quot;.
Olatunji&#x27;s subsequent recordings include &quot;Drums of Passion: The Invocation&quot; (1988), &quot;Drums of Passion: The Beat&quot; (1989) (which included Airto Moreira and Carlos Santana), &quot;Love Drum Talk&quot; (1997), &quot;Circle of Drums&quot; (2005; originally titled &quot;Cosmic Rhythm Vibrations&quot;, with Muruga Booker and Sikiru Adepoju), and &quot;Olatunji Live at Starwood&quot; (2003 – recorded at the 1997 Starwood Festival with guest Halim El-Dabh). He also contributed to &quot;Peace Is the World Smiling: A Peace Anthology for Families&quot; on the Music for Little People label (1993).

===Film and theatre===
Olatunji&#x27;s most notable involvement comes from composing music for both the Broadway theatrical and the 1961 Hollywood film adaptations of Lorraine Hansberry&#x27;s acclaimed play, &quot;Raisin in the Sun&quot;. Olatunji&#x27;s musical compositions added a rich and evocative layer to these productions, enhancing the overall emotional impact of the storytelling. In 1986, he played a role in the creation of the soundtrack for Spike Lee&#x27;s film, &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It.&quot; Collaborating with renowned musician Bill Lee, Olatunji lent his expertise to the musical score, contributing to the film&#x27;s cultural resonance and critical acclaim. His involvement in this project underscored his ability to seamlessly blend traditional African rhythms with contemporary sounds, creating a musical backdrop that complemented the narrative and resonated with audiences.

Furthermore, Olatunji&#x27;s collaboration with Bill Lee on &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot; exemplifies his commitment to fostering intergenerational musical partnerships. Assisting Bill Lee, and by extension, contributing to the success of Spike Lee&#x27;s directorial debut, Olatunji showcased not only his musical prowess but also his ability to mentor and inspire emerging talents in the industry.

===Activism===
Olatunji was known for making an impassioned speech for social justice before performing in front of a live audience. His progressive political beliefs are outlined in &quot;The Beat of My Drum: An Autobiography&quot;, with a foreword by Joan Baez, (Temple University Press, 2005). He toured the American south with Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and joined King in the march on Washington.

When he performed before the United Nations General Assembly, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev took off his shoes and danced. Later, he was one of the first outside performers to perform in Prague at Václav Havel&#x27;s request. On July 21, 1979, he appeared at the Amandla Festival along with Bob Marley, Dick Gregory, Patti LaBelle and Eddie Palmieri, amongst others.

===Teaching career===
Olatunji was a music educator, and invented a method of teaching and recording drum patterns which he called the &quot;Gun-Dun, Go-Do, Pa-Ta&quot; method after the different sounds made on the drum. He taught drum and dance workshops year-round starting in the late 1950s. Over the years he presented workshops nationally and internationally at colleges, universities, civic, cultural, and governmental organizations.

He co-wrote &quot;Musical Instruments of Africa: Their Nature, Use and Place in the Life of a Deeply Musical People&quot; with Betty Warner-Dietz (John Day Company, 1965). He taught a summer drumming and African dance course with his wife, at the Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, New York for many summers during Family week. He also taught at the Esalen Institute in California beginning in 1985.

==Later life and death==
Starting in the late 1980s Olatunji had a resurgent late career with the release of recordings on the Rykodisc label, &quot;Olatunji - Drums of Passion,The Invocation and&quot; &quot;Olatunji - Drums of Passion, The Beat&quot;. The 1990s brought further recordings with &quot;Babatunde Olatunji, Healing Session, (&quot;originally released as a limited edition cassette tape and later on CD in 2003), and &quot;Drums of Passion - Freedom, Justice and Peace&quot;.

The 1991 release on Rykodisc, &quot;Planet Drum&quot;, a collaboration with Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead, along with multiple drummers, spent a record setting streak of weeks as the number 1 ranked recording on Billboard&#x27;s Top World Music Album chart. Olatunji with the drumming ensemble supported the recording with a ten city national tour, playing sold out shows at such venues as Carnegie Hall. In 1994, a major box set compiling the complete Columbia Record recordings was issued by Bear Family Records. The 1997 recording, &quot;Love Drum Talk&quot;, on the Chesky label, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best World Beat Music.

Throughout the 1990s Olatunji&#x27;s tour schedule more than doubled bringing Drums of Passion to events as far-flung as the International Peace University, Berlin, Kodo Drum Society of Japan, The National Cathedral of the United States of America, Ontario Anti-Racist Secretariat, Universita della Studi di Napoli, United Nations Hunger Project, along with an endless schedule of theater and club dates. During the 1990s Olatunji&#x27;s educational workshops were presented by organizations associated with the human potential movement, such as Esalen Institute, Omega Institute&quot;,&quot; Hollyhock Farm, and organizations in Europe. In 1997, Olatunji was impresario for the Ghana Dance Ensemble, bringing the world famous performance and education group from Accra, Ghana, to tour the U.S.

In early 2000, Olatunji purchased a home in Washington, D.C., where he lived for a short time, along with his roommate, Professor Akinsola Akiwowo. There he was assisted by Jaqui MacMillan and Chris Stewart, before he sold the house and moved to California. For the few years before his death Olatunji made his home at the wild Big Sur coastline. He became a scholar-in-residence at the Esalen Institute. During this time, he already suffered severely from diabetes and was assisted by Nora Arjuna, Leo Thompson, Jamie &quot;Joriahna&quot; Lee, and Leon Ryan until shortly before his death from diabetes in Salinas, California in 2003, one day before his 76th birthday. He was survived by his wife Amy, 3 children (Omotola Olatunji, Folasade Olatunji Olusekun, and Modupe Olatunji), 7 grandchildren, and a cousin, Akinsola Akiwowo.

<text>The foxtrot is a smooth, progressive dance characterized by long, continuous flowing movements across the dance floor. It is danced to big band (usually vocal) music. The dance is similar in its look to waltz, although the rhythm is in a time signature instead of . Developed in the 1910s, the foxtrot reached its height of popularity in the 1930s and remains practiced today.

== History ==

The dance was premiered in 1914, quickly catching the eye of the husband and wife duo Vernon and Irene Castle, who gave the dance its signature grace and style. The origin of the name of the dance is unclear, although one theory is that it took its name from its popularizer, the vaudevillian Harry Fox. Two sources, Vernon Castle and dance teacher Betty Lee, credit African American dancers as the source of the foxtrot. Castle saw the dance, which &quot;had been danced by negroes, to his personal knowledge, for fifteen years, [at] a certain exclusive colored club&quot;.

W. C. Handy (&quot;Father of the Blues&quot;) notes in his autobiography that his &quot;The Memphis Blues&quot; was the inspiration for the foxtrot. During breaks from the fast-paced Castle Walk and One-step, Vernon and Irene Castle&#x27;s music director, James Reese Europe, would slowly play &quot;The Memphis Blues&quot;. The Castles were intrigued by the rhythm, and Jim asked why they didn&#x27;t create a slow dance to go with it. The Castles introduced what they then called the &quot;Bunny Hug&quot; in a magazine article. Shortly after, they went abroad and, in mid-ocean, sent a wireless to the magazine to change the name of the dance from &quot;Bunny Hug&quot; to &quot;Foxtrot.&quot; It was subsequently standardized by Arthur Murray, in whose version it began to imitate the positions of tango.

At its inception, the foxtrot was originally danced to ragtime. From the late 1910s through the 1940s, the foxtrot was the most popular fast dance, and the vast majority of records issued during these years were foxtrots. The waltz and tango, while popular, never overtook it. Even the popularity of the Lindy hop in the 1940s did not affect the foxtrot&#x27;s popularity, since it could be danced to the same records used to accompany the Lindy hop.

When rock and roll first emerged in the early 1950s, record companies were uncertain as to what style of dance would be most applicable to the music. Notably, Decca Records initially labeled its rock and roll releases as &quot;foxtrots&quot;, most notably &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; by Bill Haley and His Comets. Since that recording, by some estimates, went on to sell more than 25 million copies, &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; could be considered the biggest-selling &quot;foxtrot&quot; of all time. Today, the dance is customarily accompanied by the same big band music to which swing is also danced.

Over time, the foxtrot split into slow and quick versions, referred to as &quot;foxtrot&quot; and &quot;quickstep&quot; respectively. In the slow category, further distinctions exist between the International or English style of the foxtrot, and the American continuity style, both built around a slow-quick-quick rhythm at the slowest tempo, and the social American style using a slow-slow-quick-quick rhythm at a somewhat faster pace. In the context of International Standard category of ballroom dances, for some time the foxtrot was called &quot;Slow Foxtrot&quot;, or &quot;Slowfox&quot;. These names are still in use, to distinguish from other types of foxtrots.

== Styles ==
Three distinct styles of slow foxtrot are in common use among ballroom dancers today: the American Social Style, the American Continuity Style, and the International Style. All three are partner dances in which the dancers progress around the dance floor in a counter-clockwise direction and are danced to much the same music. However, they differ significantly in technique, positions, and figures.

=== American Social Foxtrot ===
The American Social Style was, and to some extent still is, widely employed in the United States as a social and party dance. It is particularly well suited to dancing in a crowded room, by partners who may or may not know each other well, and who may or may not have had much formal training in dance. Its defining feature is that the dancers close their feet at the end of almost every figure, as opposed to passing their feet as in the other two styles. As a result, the dancers progress fairly slowly around the room, and some figures can even be danced in place. Furthermore, almost every figure begins in much the same position, with the two partners facing each other squarely in the closed position and the man starting on his left foot. Since each figure leads so easily and consistently in the next, it is fairly easy for the leader to string multiple figures together on the fly in an ever-changing sequence. Body contact is unnecessary and not generally expected; all figures can be led through the frame formed by the arms. Hence, the potential social awkwardness of body contact between partners who do not know each other well is avoided. As American Social Style is the only style allowed in bronze (beginner) level American Style dance competition, this style is sometimes also known as &quot;American Bronze Foxtrot&quot;.

The American Social style uses both six-count and eight-count figures. The rhythmic alteration between the two is one of the few potential difficulties in the dance. Syncopation is generally avoided.

The six-count figures extend across one and a half measures of music, and utilize the rhythm slow (two counts), slow (two counts), quick (one count), quick (one count). Examples include: the basic movement forward and back, the alternating quarter turns (zig-zag), the rock turns right and left, the promenade, the promenade twist (12 counts), the promenade pivot (12 counts), and the sway step. Social dancers generally use the alternating quarter turns to progress in a zig-zag pattern around the room, alternating for variety with the promenade. Rock turns are used for changes of direction in corners and to avoid collisions. Both the rock turns and balance step can be danced entirely in place, if necessitated by crowded conditions. Many of these figures can be further embellished by underarm turns.

The eight-count figures extend across two measures of music and utilize the rhythm slow (two counts), quick (one count), quick (one count); slow (two counts), quick (one count), quick (one count). Most of them can be further decomposed into two four-count figures, although this would break the convention that every figure begins in closed position with the man stepping on his left foot. Examples include: the forward and reverse box, the left and right box turns, the closed twinkle with promenade close ending, the fallaway twinkles (16 counts), the promenade twinkles (16 counts), and the serpentine (progressive twinkles) with closed footwork. A few, such as the grapevine, utilize a faster rhythm consisting of four quicks. Most of these eight-count figures resemble corresponding figures in the waltz, with the rhythm modified by extending the first step of each figure to occupy two counts. Again, many of these figures can be further embellished by underarm turns.

The only common syncopated figure is the chassé. It is a four-count figure with the rhythm slow (two counts) quick-and-quick (two counts), that may be inserted between a closed twinkle and its promenade close ending.

=== American Continuity Style ===
The American Continuity Style is widely employed in the United States as a competitive dance and as a base for formation dance and the performing arts. It is the style generally seen in American musical theater productions and in film. It differs from the social style in that the dancers pass their feet at the end of each figure, rather than closing them. Consequently, dancers progress much more rapidly around the room, in a smooth, continuous manner that gives the style its name. It differs from the International Style in that body contact is optional. This permits the dance partners to assume a much wider variety of positions and, therefore, to execute many types of figures that are not possible in the International Style. As American Continuity Style is expected in Silver Level American Style dance competitions and above, this style is sometimes also known as &quot;American Silver Foxtrot&quot;.

Transitions from one dance position to another are an important aspect of the American style. Commonly employed dance positions include normal (closed) position, in which the dancers face each other squarely with the man&#x27;s right hand around the woman&#x27;s back; promenade position, in which the partners open slightly in a vee; open position (a two-hand hold with the arms extending forward sideways); and shadow position (in which both partners face the same direction, rather than each other). Partners may even separate completely for short periods of time. &quot;Lines&quot;, in which the partners form and hold a special shape for a short period of time, also play an important role. Examples include the oversway, the chair, the check.

In the American Continuity Style, most figures are based upon four-count units with the rhythm slow (two counts), quick (one count), quick (one count) repeating in each measure. A basic dance sequence progressing around the room in a straight line might consist of an open left box turn (eight counts), an open twinkle (four counts), an open right turn (four counts), an open impetus (a/k/a hairpin) (four counts), and a continuity ending (four counts), returning to the start of the sequence. Other figures based upon the same rhythm include the serpentine (a/k/a progressive twinkles) with open footwork; the curved running steps; the outside swivel; the pivot from promenade; and the natural fallaway. Many of these figures may be executed in a variety of positions: for instance, the serpentine may be executed in closed position, open position, or shadow position, with the man facing either forwards or backwards. Many of these figures may be further embellished by underarm turns, especially when changing from one dance position to another. Variations upon this basic rhythm may employ four quick steps (quick, quick, quick, quick) as in the grapevine and the second measure of the weave, or syncopation (slow, quick-and-quick quick) as in the chassé.

Many Continuity-Style Foxtrot figures are similar to those of American Continuity Style Waltz, with the rhythm modified by extending the first step of each figure to occupy two counts. Some, like the open twinkles, are direct developments of the corresponding Social Foxtrot figures in which the footwork has been modified by passing the feet at the end of the figure instead of closing the feet; others are entirely different.

=== International Style ===
The International (British) Style is widely employed in Europe and Great Britain as a social and competitive dance. Its defining characteristic is that partners must maintain body contact at all times. Consequently, the variety of possible figures and positions is much more limited than in the American style. Dancers concentrate on creating an image of a smooth, gliding motion around the dance floor. The use of body contact makes it possible to execute very tight turns, which is further enhanced by the extensive use of heel turns. This use of heel turns, and the effort required to produce the desired gliding motion, give International Style Foxtrot a reputation as being perhaps the most difficult of all ballroom dances to execute well.

Most figures are based upon four-count units with the rhythm slow (two counts), quick (one count), quick (one count), repeating in each measure. A basic dance sequence progressing around the room might employ a feather step (four counts), reverse turn with feather finish (eight counts), three step (four counts), natural turn (four counts) with impetus (four count) and feather finish (four count), connecting again to a reverse turn. However, rhythmic variation is used to make up for the loss of variety in figures and positions: thus, for example, the weave uses four quick steps in a single measure, while the change of direction uses a two-measure sequence of four slow steps.


==== Figures ====
International Style Foxtrot is the most tightly defined of all the Foxtrot styles, with instructional and competitive syllabi that are tightly controlled by the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing. Thus, it is possible to present the following list of International or English style foxtrot figures, although this is by no means an exhaustive list.
Basic Figures
* Three Step
* Feather Step
* Natural Turn
* Reverse Turn
* Closed Impetus
* Feather Finish
Standard Figures
* Natural Weave
* Basic Weave
* Closed Telemark
* Open Telemark
* Hover Feather
* Hover Telemark
* Hover Cross
* Open Impetus
* Reverse Wave
== Competition ==
International Foxtrot is one of the five Standard dances that form the backbone of International Style Dance competitions held around the world under the auspices of the International Dance Sport Federation, its local affiliates, and other organizations. Competitions are generally held at six successive levels of difficulty: Bronze (beginning), Silver (intermediate), Gold (advanced), Novice, Pre-Championship, and Championship. The Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels are syllabus levels: that is, for each level there is a prescribed syllabus of figures from which the competitor is expected to select. The Novice, Pre-Championship, and Championship levels are open levels at which novel, original choreography is permitted and even encouraged. The competitive dance syllabi are defined and tightly controlled by the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing.

Likewise, American Foxtrot is one of the four Modern Smooth dances that form the backbone of American Style Dance competitions held in the United States under the auspices of the National Dance Council of America and USA Dance, and in some other countries. Competitions are again generally held at six successive levels of difficulty: Bronze (beginning), Silver (intermediate), Gold (advanced), Novice, Pre-Championship, and Championship. The Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels are restricted levels in which the permitted set of figures is restricted by rules – very similar but not identical – published by the sponsoring organization. The Novice, Pre-Championship, and Championship levels are open levels at which novel, original choreography is permitted and even encouraged. At the Bronze level, only American Social Style is allowed; this is enforced by rules that require closing the feet at the end of each figure. Either Social or Continuity Style may be employed at the Silver level and higher, but Continuity Style is generally expected. There are multiple, alternative instructional and competitive syllabi published by various organizations, which are compatible to varying degrees with the competitive rule sets.

<doc id="210988" wikidata="Q422936" url="?curid=210988" title="Cannabinoid">
<text>Cannabinoids () are several structural classes of compounds found in the cannabis plant primarily and most animal organisms (although insects lack such receptors) or as synthetic compounds. The most notable cannabinoid is the phytocannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (delta-9-THC), the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis. Cannabidiol (CBD) is also a major constituent of temperate cannabis plants and a minor constituent in tropical varieties. At least 100 distinct phytocannabinoids have been isolated from cannabis, although only four (i.e., THCA, CBDA, CBCA and their common precursor CBGA) have been demonstrated to have a biogenetic origin. It was reported in 2020 that phytocannabinoids can be found in other plants such as rhododendron, licorice and liverwort, and earlier in Echinacea.

Phytocannabinoids are multi-ring phenolic compounds structurally related to THC, but endocannabinoids are fatty acid derivatives. Nonclassical synthetic cannabinoids (cannabimimetics) include aminoalkylindoles, 1,5-diarylpyrazoles, quinolines, and arylsulfonamides as well as eicosanoids related to endocannabinoids.

== Uses ==
Medical uses include the treatment of nausea due to chemotherapy, spasticity, and possibly neuropathic pain. Common side effects include dizziness, sedation, confusion, dissociation, and &quot;feeling high&quot;.

== Cannabinoid receptors ==
Before the 1980s, cannabinoids were speculated to produce their physiological and behavioral effects via nonspecific interaction with cell membranes, instead of interacting with specific membrane-bound receptors. The discovery of the first cannabinoid receptors in the 1980s helped to resolve this debate. These receptors are common in animals. Two known cannabinoid receptors are termed CB1 and CB2, with mounting evidence of more. The human brain has more cannabinoid receptors than any other G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) type.

The Endocannabinoid System (ECS) regulates many functions of the human body. The ECS plays an important role in multiple aspects of neural functions, including the control of movement and motor coordination, learning and memory, emotion and motivation, addictive-like behavior and pain modulation, among others.

=== Cannabinoid receptor type 1 ===

CB1 receptors are found primarily in the brain, more specifically in the basal ganglia and in the limbic system, including the hippocampus and the striatum. They are also found in the cerebellum and in both male and female reproductive systems. CB1 receptors are absent in the medulla oblongata, the part of the brain stem responsible for respiratory and cardiovascular functions. CB1 is also found in the human anterior eye and retina.

=== Cannabinoid receptor type 2 ===

CB2 receptors are predominantly found in the immune system, or immune-derived cells with varying expression patterns. While found only in the peripheral nervous system, a report does indicate that CB2 is expressed by a subpopulation of microglia in the human cerebellum. CB2 receptors appear to be responsible for immunomodulatory and possibly other therapeutic effects of cannabinoid as seen in vitro and in animal models.

== Phytocannabinoids ==


The classical cannabinoids are concentrated in a viscous resin produced in structures known as glandular trichomes. At least 113 different cannabinoids have been isolated from the &quot;Cannabis&quot; plant.

All classes derive from cannabigerol-type (CBG) compounds and differ mainly in the way this precursor is cyclized. The classical cannabinoids are derived from their respective 2-carboxylic acids (2-COOH) by decarboxylation (catalyzed by heat, light, or alkaline conditions).

=== Well known cannabinoids ===
The best studied cannabinoids include tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabinol (CBN).

==== Tetrahydrocannabinol ====

Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary psychoactive component of the Cannabis plant. &quot;Delta&quot;-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC, THC) and delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC), through intracellular CB1 activation, induce anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol synthesis produced naturally in the body and brain. These cannabinoids produce the effects associated with cannabis by binding to the CB1 cannabinoid receptors in the brain.

==== Cannabidiol ====

Cannabidiol (CBD) is mildly psychotropic. Evidence shows that the compound counteracts cognitive impairment associated with the use of cannabis. Cannabidiol has little affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors but acts as an indirect antagonist of cannabinoid agonists. It was found to be an antagonist at the putative new cannabinoid receptor, GPR55, a GPCR expressed in the caudate nucleus and putamen. Cannabidiol has also been shown to act as a 5-HT1A receptor agonist. CBD can interfere with the uptake of adenosine, which plays an important role in biochemical processes, such as energy transfer. It may play a role in promoting sleep and suppressing arousal.

CBD shares a with THC and is the main cannabinoid in CBD-dominant &quot;Cannabis&quot; strains. CBD has been shown to play a role in preventing the short-term memory loss associated with THC.

There is tentative evidence that CBD has an anti-psychotic effect, but research in this area is limited.

==== Cannabinol ====

Cannabinol (CBN) is a mildly psychoactive cannabinoid that acts as a low affinity partial agonist at both CB1 and CB2 receptors. Through its mechanism of partial agonism at the CB1R, CBN is thought to interact with other kinds of neurotransmission (e.g., dopaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and noradrenergic).

CBN was the first cannabis compound to be isolated from cannabis extract in the late 1800s. Its structure and chemical synthesis were achieved by 1940, followed by some of the first pre-clinical research studies to determine the effects of individual cannabis-derived compounds in vivo. Although CBN shares the same mechanism of action as other more well-known phytocannabinoids (e.g., delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol or D9THC), it has a lower affinity for CB1 receptors, meaning that much higher doses of CBN are required in order to experience physiologic effects (e.g., mild sedation) associated with CB1R agonism. Although scientific reports are conflicting, the majority of findings suggest that CBN has a slightly higher affinity for CB2 as compared to CB1. Although CBN has been marketed as a sleep aid in recent years, there is a lack of scientific evidence to support these claims, warranting skepticism on the part of consumers.

=== Biosynthesis ===
Cannabinoid production starts when an enzyme causes geranyl pyrophosphate and olivetolic acid to combine and form CBGA. Next, CBGA is independently converted to either CBG, THCA, CBDA or CBCA by four separate synthase, FAD-dependent dehydrogenase enzymes. There is no evidence for enzymatic conversion of CBDA or CBD to THCA or THC. For the propyl homologues (THCVA, CBDVA and CBCVA), there is an analogous pathway that is based on CBGVA from divarinolic acid instead of olivetolic acid.

=== Double bond position ===
In addition, each of the compounds above may be in different forms depending on the position of the double bond in the alicyclic carbon ring. There is potential for confusion because there are different numbering systems used to describe the position of this double bond. Under the dibenzopyran numbering system widely used today, the major form of THC is called Δ9-THC, while the minor form is called Δ8-THC. Under the alternate terpene numbering system, these same compounds are called Δ1-THC and Δ6-THC, respectively.

=== Length ===
Most classical cannabinoids are 21-carbon compounds. However, some do not follow this rule, primarily because of variation in the length of the side-chain attached to the aromatic ring. In THC, CBD, and CBN, this side-chain is a pentyl (5-carbon) chain. In the most common homologue, the pentyl chain is replaced with a propyl (3-carbon) chain. Cannabinoids with the propyl side chain are named using the suffix &quot;varin&quot; and are designated THCV, CBDV, or CBNV, while those with the heptyl side chain are named using the suffix &quot;phorol&quot; and are designated THCP and CBDP.

=== Cannabinoids in other plants ===

Phytocannabinoids are known to occur in several plant species besides cannabis. These include &quot;Echinacea purpurea&quot;, &quot;Echinacea angustifolia&quot;, &quot;Acmella oleracea&quot;, &quot;Helichrysum umbraculigerum&quot;, and &quot;Radula marginata&quot;. The best-known cannabinoids that are not derived from Cannabis are the Anandamide-like alkylamides from &quot;Echinacea&quot; species, most notably the cis/trans isomers of dodeca-2E,4E,8Z,10E/Z-tetraenoic-acid-isobutylamide. At least 25 different alkylamides have been identified, and some of them have shown affinities to the CB2-receptor. In some &quot;Echinacea&quot; species, cannabinoids are found throughout the plant structure, but are most concentrated in the roots and flowers. Yangonin found in the kava plant has significant affinity to the CB1 receptor. Tea (Camellia sinensis) catechins have an affinity for human cannabinoid receptors. A widespread dietary terpene, beta-caryophyllene, a component from the essential oil of cannabis and other medicinal plants, has also been identified as a selective agonist of peripheral CB2-receptors, &quot;in vivo&quot;. Black truffles contain anandamide. Perrottetinene, a moderately psychoactive cannabinoid, has been isolated from different &quot;Radula&quot; varieties. Machaeriol A and related compounds are found in plants from the &quot;Machaerium&quot; family.

Most of the phytocannabinoids are nearly insoluble in water but are soluble in lipids, alcohols, and other non-polar organic solvents.

=== Cannabis plant profile ===
Cannabis plants can exhibit wide variation in the quantity and type of cannabinoids they produce. The mixture of cannabinoids produced by a plant is known as the plant&#x27;s cannabinoid profile. Selective breeding has been used to control the genetics of plants and modify the cannabinoid profile. For example, strains that are used as fiber (commonly called hemp) are bred such that they are low in psychoactive chemicals like THC. Strains used in medicine are often bred for high CBD content, and strains used for recreational purposes are usually bred for high THC content or for a specific chemical balance.

Quantitative analysis of a plant&#x27;s cannabinoid profile is often determined by gas chromatography (GC), or more reliably by gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Liquid chromatography (LC) techniques are also possible and, unlike GC methods, can differentiate between the acid and neutral forms of the cannabinoids. There have been systematic attempts to monitor the cannabinoid profile of cannabis over time, but their accuracy is impeded by the illegal status of the plant in many countries.

=== Pharmacology ===
Cannabinoids can be administered by smoking, vaporizing, oral ingestion, transdermal patch, intravenous injection, sublingual absorption, or rectal suppository. Once in the body, most cannabinoids are metabolized in the liver, especially by cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidases, mainly CYP 2C9. Thus supplementing with CYP 2C9 inhibitors leads to extended intoxication.

Some is also stored in fat in addition to being metabolized in the liver. Δ9-THC is metabolized to 11-hydroxy-Δ9-THC, which is then metabolized to 9-carboxy-THC. Some cannabis metabolites can be detected in the body several weeks after administration. These metabolites are the chemicals recognized by common antibody-based &quot;drug tests&quot;; in the case of THC or others, these loads do not represent intoxication (compare to ethanol breath tests that measure instantaneous blood alcohol levels), but an integration of past consumption over an approximately month-long window. This is because they are fat-soluble, lipophilic molecules that accumulate in fatty tissues.

Research shows the effect of cannabinoids might be modulated by aromatic compounds produced by the cannabis plant, called terpenes. This interaction would lead to the entourage effect.

==== Modulation of mitochondrial activity ====
Recent evidence has shown that cannabinoids play a role in the modulation of various mitochondrial processes, including intracellular calcium regulation, activation of apoptosis, impairment of electron transport chain activity, disruption of mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, and regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. These processes contribute to various aspects of cellular biology and can be modified in response to external stimuli. The interaction between cannabinoids and mitochondria is complex, and various molecular mechanisms have been proposed, including direct effects on mitochondrial membranes and receptor-mediated effects. However, an integrated hypothesis of cannabinoids&#x27; actions on these processes has yet to be formulated due to conflicting data and the complexity of the pathways involved.

==== Cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals ====
Nabiximols (brand name Sativex) is an aerosolized mist for oral administration containing a near 1:1 ratio of CBD and THC. Also included are minor cannabinoids and terpenoids, ethanol and propylene glycol excipients, and peppermint flavoring. The drug, made by GW Pharmaceuticals, was first approved by Canadian authorities in 2005 to alleviate pain associated with multiple sclerosis, making it the first cannabis-based medicine. It is marketed by Bayer in Canada. Sativex has been approved in 25 countries; clinical trials are underway in the United States to gain FDA approval. In 2007, it was approved for treatment of cancer pain. In Phase III trials, the most common adverse effects were dizziness, drowsiness and disorientation; 12% of subjects stopped taking the drug because of the side effects.

Dronabinol (brand names Marinol and Syndros) is a delta-9-THC containing drug for treating HIV/AIDS-induced anorexia and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

The CBD drug Epidiolex has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes.

Nabilone (Cesamet) is an FDA approved synthetic analog of THC, prescribed for the treatment of nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy treatment in people who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments.

=== Separation ===
Cannabinoids can be separated from the plant by extraction with organic solvents. Hydrocarbons and alcohols are often used as solvents. However, these solvents are flammable and many are toxic. Butane may be used, which evaporates extremely quickly. Supercritical solvent extraction with carbon dioxide is an alternative technique. Once extracted, isolated components can be separated using wiped film vacuum distillation or other distillation techniques. Also, techniques such as SPE or SPME are found useful in the extraction of these compounds.

=== History ===
The first discovery of an individual cannabinoid was made, when British chemist Robert S. Cahn reported the partial structure of Cannabinol (CBN), which he later identified as fully formed in 1940.

Two years later, in 1942, American chemist, Roger Adams, made history when he discovered Cannabidiol (CBD). Progressing from Adams research, in 1963 Israeli professor Raphael Mechoulam later identified the stereochemistry of CBD. The following year, in 1964, Mechoulam and his team identified the stereochemistry of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

Due to molecular similarity and ease of synthetic conversion, CBD was originally believed to be a natural precursor to THC. However, it is now known that CBD and THC are produced independently in the Cannabis plant from the precursor CBG.

==== Emergence of derived psychoactive cannabis products ====

The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 has been interpreted as allowing any hemp-derived product not exceeding 0.3% Δ9-THC to be sold legally in the US. Because the law limited only Δ9-THC levels, many other cannabinoids are generally considered legal to sell and are widely available in stores and online, including Δ8-THC, Δ10-THC, HHC, and THCP, but have not had the same in-depth research that the Δ9 isomer has on the human body; carrying potential risks in the short- or long-term. Other concerns include difficulties for drug testing due to novel metabolites, or high potency/binding affinity of isomers for cannabinoid receptors showing potential for abuse (i.e., THCP, which has 33× the binding affinity of Δ9-THC) From 2021 to 2023, the Δ8-THC market generated US$2 billion in revenue. Many substances are scheduled at the state level under various synonyms owing to the different dibenzopyran and monoterpenoid naming conventions. Delta-1, Delta-6, and Delta 3,4-Tetrahydrocannabinol are alternative names for Delta-9, Delta-8, and Delta-6a10a Tetrahydrocannabinol, respectively.

A 2023 paper seeking the regulation of cannabinoid terminology coined the term &quot;derived psychoactive cannabis products&quot; to accurately and usefully distinguish said products whilst excluding unrelated substances.

== Endocannabinoids ==

Endocannabinoids are substances produced from within the body that activate cannabinoid receptors. After the discovery of the first cannabinoid receptor in 1988, scientists began searching for endogenous ligands for the receptors.

=== Types of endocannabinoid ligands ===

==== Arachidonoylethanolamine (Anandamide or AEA) ====

Anandamide was the first such compound identified as arachidonoyl ethanolamine. The name is derived from &quot;ananda&quot;, the Sanskrit word for bliss. It has a pharmacology similar to THC, although its structure is quite different. Anandamide binds to the central (CB1) and, to a lesser extent, peripheral (CB2) cannabinoid receptors, where it acts as a partial agonist. Anandamide is about as potent as THC at the CB1 receptor. Anandamide is found in nearly all tissues in a wide range of animals. Anandamide has also been found in plants, including small amounts in chocolate.

Two analogs of anandamide, 7,10,13,16-docosatetraenoylethanolamide and &quot;homo&quot;-γ-linolenoylethanolamine, have similar pharmacology. All of these compounds are members of a family of signalling lipids called &quot;N&quot;-acylethanolamines, which also includes the noncannabimimetic palmitoylethanolamide and oleoylethanolamide, which possess anti-inflammatory and anorexigenic effects, respectively. Many &quot;N&quot;-acylethanolamines have also been identified in plant seeds and in molluscs.

==== 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) ====

Another endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, binds to both the CB1 and CB2 receptors with similar affinity, acting as a full agonist at both. 2-AG is present at significantly higher concentrations in the brain than anandamide, and there is some controversy over whether 2-AG rather than anandamide is chiefly responsible for endocannabinoid signalling &quot;in vivo&quot;. In particular, one &quot;in vitro&quot; study suggests that 2-AG is capable of stimulating higher G-protein activation than anandamide, although the physiological implications of this finding are not yet known.

==== 2-Arachidonyl glyceryl ether (noladin ether) ====

In 2001, a third, ether-type endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether (noladin ether), was isolated from porcine brain. Prior to this discovery, it had been synthesized as a stable analog of 2-AG; indeed, some controversy remains over its classification as an endocannabinoid, as another group failed to detect the substance at &quot;any appreciable amount&quot; in the brains of several different mammalian species. It binds to the CB1 cannabinoid receptor (&quot;K&quot;i = 21.2 nmol/L) and causes sedation, hypothermia, intestinal immobility, and mild antinociception in mice. It binds primarily to the CB1 receptor, and only weakly to the CB2 receptor.

==== &quot;N&quot;-Arachidonoyl dopamine (NADA) ====

Discovered in 2000, NADA preferentially binds to the CB1 receptor. Like anandamide, NADA is also an agonist for the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1), a member of the vanilloid receptor family.

==== Virodhamine (OAE) ====

A fifth endocannabinoid, virodhamine, or &quot;O&quot;-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine (OAE), was discovered in June 2002. Although it is a full agonist at CB2 and a partial agonist at CB1, it behaves as a CB1 antagonist &quot;in vivo&quot;. In rats, virodhamine was found to be present at comparable or slightly lower concentrations than anandamide in the brain, but 2- to 9-fold higher concentrations peripherally.

==== Lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) ====
Lysophosphatidylinositol is the endogenous ligand to novel endocannabinoid receptor GPR55, making it a strong contender as the sixth endocannabinoid.

=== Function ===

Endocannabinoids serve as intercellular &#x27;lipid messengers&#x27;, signaling molecules that are released from one cell and activating the cannabinoid receptors present on other nearby cells. Although in this intercellular signaling role they are similar to the well-known monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, endocannabinoids differ in numerous ways from them. For instance, they are used in retrograde signaling between neurons. Furthermore, endocannabinoids are lipophilic molecules that are not very soluble in water. They are not stored in vesicles and exist as integral constituents of the membrane bilayers that make up cells. They are believed to be synthesized &#x27;on-demand&#x27; rather than made and stored for later use.

As hydrophobic molecules, endocannabinoids cannot travel unaided for long distances in the aqueous medium surrounding the cells from which they are released and therefore act locally on nearby target cells. Hence, although emanating diffusely from their source cells, they have much more restricted spheres of influence than do hormones, which can affect cells throughout the body.

The mechanisms and enzymes underlying the biosynthesis of endocannabinoids remain elusive and continue to be an area of active research.

The endocannabinoid 2-AG has been found in bovine and human maternal milk.

A review by Matties et al. (1994) summed up the phenomenon of gustatory enhancement by certain cannabinoids. The sweet receptor (Tlc1) is stimulated by indirectly increasing its expression and suppressing the activity of leptin, the Tlc1 antagonist. It is proposed that the competition of leptin and cannabinoids for Tlc1 is implicated in energy homeostasis.

==== Retrograde signal ====
Conventional neurotransmitters are released from a ‘presynaptic’ cell and activate appropriate receptors on a ‘postsynaptic’ cell, where presynaptic and postsynaptic designate the sending and receiving sides of a synapse, respectively. Endocannabinoids, on the other hand, are described as retrograde transmitters because they most commonly travel ‘backward’ against the usual synaptic transmitter flow. They are, in effect, released from the postsynaptic cell and act on the presynaptic cell, where the target receptors are densely concentrated on axonal terminals in the zones from which conventional neurotransmitters are released. Activation of cannabinoid receptors temporarily reduces the amount of conventional neurotransmitter released. This endocannabinoid-mediated system permits the postsynaptic cell to control its own incoming synaptic traffic. The ultimate effect on the endocannabinoid-releasing cell depends on the nature of the conventional transmitter being controlled. For instance, when the release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA is reduced, the net effect is an increase in the excitability of the endocannabinoid-releasing cell. On the converse, when release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is reduced, the net effect is a decrease in the excitability of the endocannabinoid-releasing cell. 

==== &quot;Runner&#x27;s high&quot; ====
The runner&#x27;s high, the feeling of euphoria that sometimes accompanies aerobic exercise, has often been attributed to the release of endorphins, but newer research suggests that it might be due to endocannabinoids instead.

== Synthetic cannabinoids ==
Historically, laboratory synthesis of cannabinoids was often based on the structure of herbal cannabinoids, and a large number of analogs have been produced and tested, especially in a group led by Roger Adams as early as 1941 and later in a group led by Raphael Mechoulam. Newer compounds are no longer related to natural cannabinoids or are based on the structure of the endogenous cannabinoids.

Synthetic cannabinoids are particularly useful in experiments to determine the relationship between the structure and activity of cannabinoid compounds, by making systematic, incremental modifications of cannabinoid molecules.

When synthetic cannabinoids are used recreationally, they present significant health dangers to users. In the period of 2012 through 2014, over 10,000 contacts to poison control centers in the United States were related to use of synthetic cannabinoids.

Medications containing natural or synthetic cannabinoids or cannabinoid analogs:
* Dronabinol (Marinol), is synthetic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), used as an appetite stimulant, anti-emetic, and analgesic
* Nabilone (Cesamet, Canemes), a synthetic cannabinoid and an analog of Marinol. It is Schedule II unlike Marinol, which is Schedule III
* Rimonabant (SR141716), a selective cannabinoid (CB1) receptor inverse agonist once used as an anti-obesity drug under the proprietary name Acomplia. It was also used for smoking cessation

Other notable synthetic cannabinoids include:
* JWH-018, a potent synthetic cannabinoid agonist discovered by John W. Huffman at Clemson University. It was often sold in legal smoke blends collectively known as &quot;spice&quot;. Several countries and states have moved to ban it legally.
* JWH-073
* CP-55940, produced in 1974, this synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist is many times more potent than THC.
* Dimethylheptylpyran
* HU-210, about 100 times as potent as THC
* HU-211, a synthetic cannabinoid derived drug that acts on NMDA instead of endocannabinoid system
* HU-331 a potential anti-cancer drug derived from cannabidiol that specifically inhibits topoisomerase II.
* SR144528, a CB2 receptor antagonist/ inverse agonist
* WIN 55,212-2, a potent cannabinoid receptor agonist
* JWH-133, a potent selective CB2 receptor agonist
* Levonantradol (Nantrodolum), an anti-emetic and analgesic but not currently in use in medicine
* AM-2201, a potent cannabinoid receptor agonist
Recently, the term &quot;neocannabinoid&quot; has been introduced to distinguish these designer drugs from &quot;synthetic phytocannabinoids&quot; (obtained by chemical synthesis) or &quot;synthetic endocannabinoids.&quot;

<text>The Matrix Revolutions is a 2003 American science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis. It is the third installment in &quot;The Matrix&quot; film series, released six months following &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. The film stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Jada Pinkett Smith, Monica Bellucci, Lambert Wilson, and Mary Alice who replaced Gloria Foster as the Oracle following Foster&#x27;s death in 2001.

The film was released simultaneously in 108 territories on November 5, 2003, by Warner Bros. Pictures. While being the final entry in the original trilogy of the series, the &quot;Matrix&quot; storyline was continued in &quot;The Matrix Online&quot; video game. &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; was the first live-action feature film to be released in both regular and IMAX theaters at the same time. It grossed $427 million worldwide, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2003. The film received mixed reviews.

A fourth film, titled &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;, began production in February 2020 and was released on December 22, 2021.

==Plot==
Picking up immediately where &quot;Reloaded&quot; ended, Neo and Bane still lie unconscious in the medical bay of the ship &quot;Mjolnir&quot;. Inside the Matrix, Neo is trapped in a subway station named Mobil Ave, a transition zone between the Matrix and the machine world. He meets a &quot;family&quot; of programs, including a girl named Sati. The &quot;father&quot; tells Neo the subway is controlled by the Trainman, a program loyal to the Merovingian. When Neo tries to board a train with the family, the Trainman refuses and overpowers him.

Seraph contacts Morpheus and Trinity on behalf of the Oracle, who informs them of Neo&#x27;s confinement. Seraph, Morpheus and Trinity enter Club Hel, where they confront the Merovingian and force him to release Neo. Troubled by visions of the Machine City, Neo visits the Oracle, who reveals that Smith intends to destroy both the Matrix and the real world. She tells him that &quot;everything that has a beginning has an end.&quot; After Neo leaves, a large group of Smiths assimilates Sati and Seraph. The Oracle does not resist assimilation, and Smith gains her powers of precognition.

In the real world, the crews of the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; and the &quot;Mjolnir&quot; find and reactivate Niobe&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Logos&quot;. They interrogate Bane, who says that he has no recollection of the earlier massacre. As the captains plan their defense of Zion, Neo requests a ship to travel to the Machine City. Motivated by her encounter with the Oracle, Niobe offers him the &quot;Logos&quot;. Neo departs, accompanied by Trinity. Bane, who has stowed away on the &quot;Logos&quot;, takes Trinity hostage. Neo realizes that Bane has been assimilated by Smith, and a fight ensues. Bane burns Neo&#x27;s eyes with a power cable, blinding him. Neo discovers that he can still &quot;see&quot; machine source code in the real world and uses this ability to kill Bane. Trinity pilots them to the Machine City.

Niobe and Morpheus rush toward Zion in the &quot;Mjolnir&quot; to aid the human defenses. Zion&#x27;s shipyard is overwhelmed by a horde of Sentinels, and the fatally wounded Captain Mifune instructs Kid to open the gate for the &quot;Mjolnir&quot;, which he does with the aid of Zee. When it arrives, it discharges its EMP, disabling all the Sentinels present but also Zion&#x27;s remaining defenses. The humans are forced to retreat and wait for the next attack, thinking it will be their last stand.

The &quot;Logos&quot; is attacked by a wave of machines outside of the Machine City. To avoid the onslaught, they fly above them to open sky, and then crash into a building, fatally wounding Trinity. Neo enters the Machine City and encounters the leadership of the machines in the form of the &quot;Deus Ex Machina.&quot; Neo warns that Smith plans to conquer both the Matrix and the real world and offers to stop Smith in exchange for peace with Zion. The Deus Ex Machina agrees, and the Sentinels shut down, stopping the attack on Zion.

The Machines plug Neo into the Matrix, whose population has now been entirely assimilated by Smith. The Smith with the Oracle&#x27;s powers steps forth, telling Neo that he has foreseen his victory against Neo. After a protracted fight, Neo appears to concede defeat and allows himself to be assimilated. Outside the Matrix, the machines send a surge of energy into Neo&#x27;s body, which inside the Matrix causes the Neo-Smith clone, then all the other Smith clones, to be destroyed, restoring the Oracle and killing Neo. The Sentinels withdraw from Zion, Morpheus and Niobe embrace, and Neo&#x27;s body is carried away by the machines.

The Matrix is rebooted, and the Architect meets the Oracle in a park. They agree that the peace will last &quot;as long as it can&quot; and that those humans who desire it will be offered the opportunity to leave the Matrix. The Oracle tells Sati (who created a beautiful sunrise for Neo) that she thinks they will see Neo again. Seraph asks the Oracle if she knew this would happen. She replies that she did not know, but she believed.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film&#x27;s budget was estimated between US$110 million and $150 million.

Filming occurred concurrently with its predecessor, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, and live-action sequences for the video game &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;. This took place primarily at Fox Studios in Sydney, Australia. Most notably, the subway scenes were filmed at the disused tunnels of St James railway station, and the end sequence with the Oracle and the Architect was filmed in the Royal Botanic Garden. Carrie-Anne Moss injured her ankle during the shooting in Australia.

===Soundtrack===

In contrast to its predecessors, very few &quot;source&quot; tracks are used in the film. Aside from Don Davis&#x27; score, again collaborating with Juno Reactor, only one external track (by Pale 3) is used. Although Davis rarely focuses on strong melodies, familiar leitmotifs from earlier in the series reappear. For example, Neo and Trinity&#x27;s love theme—which briefly surfaces in the two preceding films—is finally fully expanded into &quot;Trinity Definitely&quot;; the theme from the Zion docks in &quot;Reloaded&quot; returns as &quot;Men in Metal&quot;, and the energetic drumming from the &quot;Reloaded&quot; tea house fight between Neo and Seraph opens &quot;Tetsujin&quot;, as Seraph, Trinity and Morpheus fight off Club Hel&#x27;s three doormen. The climactic battle theme, named &quot;Neodämmerung&quot; (in reference to Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;), features a choir singing extracts (shlokas) from the Pavamana Mantra, introduced in the Upanishads. The chorus can be roughly translated from Sanskrit as follows: &quot;lead us from untruth to truth, lead us from darkness to light, lead us from death to immortality, peace peace peace&quot;. The extracts were brought to Davis by the Wachowskis when he informed them that it would be wasteful for such a large choir to be singing simple &quot;ooh&quot;s and &quot;aah&quot;s (according to the DVD commentary, Davis felt that the dramatic impact of the piece would be lost if the choir was to sing &#x27;This is the one, see what he can do&#x27; in plain English). These extracts return in the film&#x27;s denouement, and in &quot;Navras&quot;, the track that plays over the closing credits (which may be considered a loose remix of &quot;Neodämmerung&quot;).

==Release==
&quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; was released in theaters roughly three weeks after &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; arrived on DVD, on October 14, 2003.

The film had the widest release ever opening simultaneously in 108 territories at 1400 Greenwich Mean Time on November 5, 2003.

==Reception==
===Box office===
On opening day, &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; scored $24.3 million, becoming the third-highest Wednesday opening, behind &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. During its three-day opening weekend, it would earn $48.5 million. In its first five days of release, the film grossed $83.8 million in the United States and Canada from 3,502 theaters, but dropped 66% during the second week. For three years, it had the highest five-day Wednesday opening for any Warner Bros. film until it was taken by &quot;Superman Returns&quot; in 2006. The film would even compete against the newly released family films &quot;Brother Bear&quot; and &quot;Elf&quot;.

Internationally, the film grossed $119 million in its first 5 days from 10,013 prints in 107 territories, with the third-biggest opening ever in Japan and Spain and the fourth biggest in the United Kingdom, Italy and Mexico. Combined, it grossed $203 million in its first five days. This made it the highest worldwide opening weekend for any film, holding the record until it was beaten by &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; a month later. &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; would also achieve the record for having the biggest international opening weekend for an R-rated film until 2015 when it was surpassed by &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;. The film grossed over $139 million in North America and approximately $427 million worldwide, roughly half of &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; box-office total, and was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2003.

===Home media===
&quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on April 6, 2004. The film grossed $116 million in DVD sales. Additionally, it was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 30, 2018.

===Critical response===

On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; holds an approval rating of 34% based on 218 reviews and an average rating of 5.30/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A disappointing conclusion to the &quot;Matrix&quot; trilogy as characters and ideas take a back seat to the special effects.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 41 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale, a grade down from the &quot;B+&quot; earned by the previous film and two grades down from the &quot;A−&quot; earned by the first film, therefore the second lowest grade earned by a film in the series.

Some critics criticized the film for being anticlimactic. Additionally, some critics regard the film as less philosophically ambiguous than its predecessor, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. Critics had difficulty finding closure pertaining to events from &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, and were generally dissatisfied.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, despite offering criticisms of his own, on the grounds that it at least provided closure to the story well enough so that fans following the series would prefer seeing it as to not.

==Sequel==

While making the &quot;Matrix&quot; films, the Wachowskis told their close collaborators that at that time they had no intention of making another installment after &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;. Instead, they gave their blessing to the notion of gamers &quot;inherit[ing] the storyline&quot;, and &quot;The Matrix Online&quot; video game was billed as the official continuation. In February 2015, in interviews promoting &quot;Jupiter Ascending&quot;, Lilly Wachowski called a return to &quot;The Matrix&quot; a &quot;particularly repelling idea in these times&quot;, noting the studios&#x27; tendency to green-light sequels, reboots, and adaptations over original material, while Lana Wachowski, addressing rumors about a potential reboot, said that they had not heard anything, but she believed that the studio might be looking to replace them. At various times, Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving have stated that they would be willing to reprise their roles in potential &quot;Matrix&quot; films, but only if the Wachowskis were involved.

In March 2017, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise, with Zak Penn in talks to write a treatment, and interest in getting Michael B. Jordan attached to star. According to the article neither the Wachowskis nor Joel Silver were involved at that stage, although the studio would like to get at minimum the blessing of the Wachowskis.

Warner Bros. officially announced the development on a fourth film in August 2019, with Lana Wachowski serving as director and producer on it. Lana wrote the screenplay with David Mitchell and Aleksander Hemon. Grant Hill produced it alongside Lana. The production is a joint-venture between Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures, similar to the original films. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss reprise their roles from the previous films; Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving do not appear in the film. Production began in February 2020 in San Francisco, briefly halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and wrapped in November of that same year. The film, &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;, had its world premiere in Toronto, Canada on December 16, 2021, and was released in theaters and on HBO Max on December 22, 2021.

Most of the core geographic region is located on part of the Superior Geological Province of the Canadian Shield, a vast rocky plateau located mainly north of Lake Huron (including Georgian Bay), the French River, Lake Nipissing, and the Mattawa River. The statistical region extends south of the Mattawa River to include all of the District of Nipissing. The southern section of this district lies on part of the Grenville Geological Province of the Shield which occupies the transitional area between Northern and Southern Ontario. 

The extended federal and provincial quasi-administrative regions of Northern Ontario have their own boundaries even further south in the transitional area that vary according to their respective government policies and requirements. Ontario government departments and agencies such as the Growth Plan for Northern Ontario and the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation define Northern Ontario as all areas north of, and including, the districts of Parry Sound and Nipissing for political purposes, and the federal but not the provincial government also includes the district of Muskoka.

The statistical region has a land area of and constitutes 88 percent of the land area of Ontario, but with just 780,000 people, it contains only about six percent of the province&#x27;s population. The climate is characterized by extremes of temperature, with very cold winters and hot summers. The principal industries are mining, forestry, and hydroelectricity.

For some purposes, Northern Ontario is further subdivided into Northeastern and Northwestern Ontario. When the region is divided in that way, the three westernmost districts (Rainy River, Kenora and Thunder Bay) constitute Northwestern Ontario, and the other districts constitute Northeastern Ontario. Northeastern Ontario contains two thirds of Northern Ontario&#x27;s population.

In the early 20th century, Northern Ontario was often called &quot;New Ontario&quot;, although that name has fallen into disuse because of its colonial connotations. (In French, however, the region may still be referred to as , although and are now more commonly used.)

==Territorial evolution==

Those areas which formed part of New France in the , essentially the watersheds of the Ottawa River, Lake Huron and Lake Superior, had been acquired by the British by the Treaty of Paris (1763) and became part of Upper Canada in 1791, and then the Province of Canada between 1840 and 1867.

At the time of Canadian Confederation in 1867, the portion of Northern Ontario lying south of the Laurentian Divide was part of Ontario, whilst the portion north of the divide was part of the separate British territory of Rupert&#x27;s Land. The province&#x27;s boundaries were provisionally expanded northward and westward in 1874, whilst the Lake of the Woods region remained subject to a boundary dispute between Ontario and Manitoba. The region was confirmed as belonging to Ontario by decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1884, and confirmed by the Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which set the province&#x27;s new northern boundary at the Albany River.

The remaining northernmost portion of the province, from the Albany River to Hudson Bay, was transferred to the province from the Northwest Territories by the Parliament of Canada in the Ontario Boundaries Extension Act, 1912. This region was originally established as the District of Patricia, but was merged into the Kenora District in 1937.

==Judicial and administrative divisions==
The Province of Canada began creating judicial districts in sparsely populated Northern Ontario with the establishment of Algoma District and Nipissing District in 1858. These districts had no municipal function; they were created for the provision of judicial and administrative services from the district seat. Nipissing had no district seat until 1895. Up until that date, registry office and higher court services were available at Pembroke in Renfrew County. Nipissing Stipendiary Magistrate and land registrar William Doran established his residence at North Bay in 1885. Following the hotly contested district town election in 1895, North Bay earned the right to become the district seat in the new Provisional District of Nipissing. After the creation of the province of Ontario in 1867, the first district to be established was Thunder Bay in 1871 which until then had formed part of Algoma District. The Ontario government was reluctant to establish new districts in the north, partly because the northern and western boundaries of Ontario were in dispute after Confederation. Ontario&#x27;s right to Northwestern Ontario was determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1884 and confirmed by the Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. By 1899 there were seven northern districts: Algoma, Manitoulin, Muskoka, Nipissing, Parry Sound, Rainy River, and Thunder Bay. Five more northern districts were created between 1907 and 1922: Cochrane, Kenora, Sudbury, Temiskaming and Patricia. The Patricia District was then merged into the Kenora District in 1927.

Unlike the counties and regional municipalities of Southern Ontario, which have a government and administrative structure and jurisdiction over specified government services, a district lacks that level of administration. Districts are too sparsely populated to maintain a county government system, so many district-based services are provided directly by the provincial government. For example, districts have provincially maintained secondary highways instead of county roads.

Statistically, the districts in Northern Ontario (which appear in red on the location map) are Rainy River, Kenora, Thunder Bay, Cochrane, Timiskaming, Algoma, Sudbury, Nipissing and Manitoulin. The &quot;single-tier municipality&quot; of Greater Sudbury — which is not politically part of the District of Sudbury — is the only census division in Northern Ontario where county-level services are offered by a local government rather than the province.

A portion of the Nipissing District which lies south of the geographic dividing line between Northern and Southern Ontario is considered administratively and statistically part of Northern Ontario because of its status as part of Nipissing. As well, for administrative purposes, the districts of Muskoka and Parry Sound are sometimes treated as part of Northern Ontario even though they are geographically in Southern or Central Ontario. In 2004, finance minister Greg Sorbara removed Muskoka from the jurisdictional area of the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines and the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund, to which it had been added in 2000 by his predecessor Ernie Eves, but the province continues to treat Parry Sound as a Northern Ontario division under both programs. The federal government continues to retain both more southerly districts in the service area of FedNor.

All of Northeastern Ontario is within the Eastern (UTC −5) time zone; Northwestern Ontario is split between the Eastern and Central (UTC −6) time zones.

==Communities==
=== Cities ===
Northern Ontario has nine cities. In order of population as of the Canada 2021 Census, they are:
It is important to note that in the Province of Ontario there are no requirements to become a city and the designation is voluntary. As a result, there are four towns in Northern Ontario that have a larger population than its smallest city Dryden.

Until the City of Greater Sudbury was created in 2001, Thunder Bay had a larger population than the old city of Sudbury, but the Regional Municipality of Sudbury was the larger Census Metropolitan Area as Sudbury had a much more populous suburban belt (including the city of Valley East, formerly the region&#x27;s sixth-largest city.) However, as the former Regional Municipality of Sudbury is now governed as a single city, it is both the region&#x27;s largest city and the region&#x27;s largest CMA.

Other municipalities in Northern Ontario include:
==Economy==

Sudbury is the dominant city in Northeastern Ontario, and Thunder Bay is the dominant city in Northwestern Ontario. These two regions are quite distinct from each other economically and culturally, and although the two regions are adjacent, their population centres are quite distant from each other. As a result, Sudbury and Thunder Bay are each the primary city in their part of the region but neither city can be said to outrank the other as the principal economic centre of Northern Ontario as a whole.

In fact, each city has a couple of distinct advantages that the other city lacks — Sudbury is at the centre of a larger economic sphere due to the city&#x27;s, and Northeastern Ontario&#x27;s, larger population but Thunder Bay is advantaged by air, rail and shipping traffic due to its prime location along major continental transportation routes. The Thunder Bay International Airport is the third busiest airport in Ontario after Toronto Pearson International Airport and Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport, carrying some 600,000 passengers in 2004 with over 100 domestic flights and four international flights daily. Sudbury&#x27;s economy, in which the largest sectors of employment are government-related fields such as education and health care, is somewhat more diversified than Thunder Bay&#x27;s, which is still based primarily on natural resources and manufacturing. Yet, in the era of government cutbacks, Thunder Bay&#x27;s economy has been less prone to recession and unemployment. Sudbury trades more readily into Southern Ontario, whereas Thunder Bay has closer trade ties to Manitoba and Minnesota.

Under the staples thesis of Canadian economic history, Northern Ontario is a &quot;hinterland&quot; or &quot;periphery&quot; region, whose economic development has been defined primarily by providing raw natural resource materials to larger and more powerful business interests from elsewhere in Canada or the world.

Northern Ontario has had difficulty in recent years maintaining both its economy and its population. All of the region&#x27;s cities declined in population between the censuses of 1996 and 2001. (This coincides with the discontinuation of the operation of the subsidized government airline norOntair in March 1996.) Although the cities have tried with mixed results to diversify their economies in recent years, most communities in the region are resource-based economies, whose economic health is very dependent on &quot;boom and bust&quot; resource cycles. Mining and forestry are the two major industries in the region, although manufacturing, transportation, public services and tourism are represented as well. After 2001, the major cities returned to patterns of modest growth in the censuses of 2006, 2011, 2016 and 2021, although many of the smaller towns saw further declines.

The cities have, by and large, been very dependent on government-related employment and investment for their economic diversification. The Liberal government of David Peterson in the 1980s moved several provincial agencies and ministries to Northern Ontario, including the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (which maintains a large office in Sault Ste. Marie) and the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (whose head office is in Greater Sudbury).

As well, many of Northern Ontario&#x27;s major tourist attractions (e.g. Science North, Dynamic Earth, the Sault Locks, etc.) are agencies of the provincial or federal governments. Further, much of the funding available for economic development in Northern Ontario comes from government initiatives such as the federal government&#x27;s Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario (FedNor) and the provincial Northern Ontario Heritage Fund.

Over the past several years, there has been a renewed interest in mining exploration. McFaulds Lake in the James Bay Lowlands has attracted the attention of junior mining exploration companies. Since the 2003 investigation of the area for diamonds, some 20 companies have staked claims in the area, forming joint ventures. While still in the exploration phase, there have been some exciting finds that could bring prosperity to the region and the First Nations communities in that area. New mining sites have also been investigated and explored in Sudbury, Timmins, Kirkland Lake, Elliot Lake and the Temagami area. In Chapleau, Probe Mines Limited is in the advanced stage of exploration and was recognized in 2013 with the Ontario Prospectors Association 2013 Ontario Prospector Award.

==Politics==
Northern Ontario has generally been one of the weakest areas in all of Canada for both the federal Progressive Conservative and Conservative parties, as well as one of the weakest areas for the provincial Progressive Conservatives. Instead, the Liberal Party has traditionally taken the majority of the region&#x27;s seats at both the federal and provincial levels. The New Democrats also have a significant base of support, thanks to Northern Ontario&#x27;s history of labour unionism, support from First Nations communities, and the personal popularity of local NDP figures.

Two Premiers of Ontario, William Hearst (1914–1919) and Mike Harris (1995–2002), represented Northern Ontario constituencies in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. However, Harris himself was the only Conservative candidate elected in a true Northern Ontario riding in either the 1995 or 1999 elections (if the definition of Northern Ontario includes the Parry Sound District, then Harris was joined by Ernie Eves in Parry Sound—Muskoka). Following Eves&#x27; retirement from politics, Norm Miller was also elected in Parry Sound—Muskoka in a by-election in 2001, and was re-elected in the 2003 and 2007 elections.
Former Ontario New Democratic Party leader Howard Hampton and former Ontario Liberal Party leader Lyn McLeod also represented Northern Ontario ridings in the provincial legislature; the six months in 1996 between Hampton&#x27;s accession to the NDP leadership in June and McLeod&#x27;s departure as Liberal leader in December marked the first and only time in Ontario&#x27;s history that all three parties in the legislature were simultaneously led by Northern Ontario MPPs.

The riding of Algoma East was represented federally by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson from 1948 to 1968. Pearson was not from the district, however, but represented the district because it had been chosen as a safe seat for him to run in a 1948 by-election following the appointment of Thomas Farquhar to the Senate of Canada.

In the 2008 federal election, the New Democratic Party won nearly every seat in the region, with the exception of Nipissing—Timiskaming, which was retained by its Liberal incumbent Anthony Rota, and Kenora, which was won by Conservative Greg Rickford. This sweep included several seats which were formerly seen as Liberal strongholds, including Sudbury, Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing, Thunder Bay—Rainy River and Thunder Bay—Superior North. In the 2011 election, the NDP retained nearly all of these seats with the exception of Sault Ste. Marie, where longtime incumbent MP Tony Martin was defeated despite that election&#x27;s historic increase in NDP support nationwide; in the 2015 election, however, a resurgence of Liberal support under Justin Trudeau resulted in the Liberals regaining all of the region&#x27;s seats except Timmins-James Bay and Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing, where the NDP incumbents were successfully re-elected.

Major political issues in recent years have included the economic health of the region, the extension of Highway 400 from Parry Sound to Sudbury, issues pertaining to the quality and availability of health care services, mining development in the Ring of Fire region around McFaulds Lake, the closure of Ontario Northland, the Algo Centre Mall roof collapse of 2012, and a controversial but now-defunct plan to ship Toronto&#x27;s garbage to the Adams Mine, an abandoned open pit mine in Kirkland Lake.

In the redistribution of provincial electoral districts before the 2007 election, the province retained the existing electoral district boundaries in Northern Ontario, rather than adjusting them to correspond to federal electoral district boundaries as was done in the southern part of the province. Without this change, the region would have &quot;lost&quot; one Member of Provincial Parliament. For the 2018 election, the province further diverged from the federal electoral districts in the region, creating the special districts of Kiiwetinoong and Mushkegowuk—James Bay to accommodate the unique political concerns of the rural far north.

Due to the region&#x27;s relatively sparse population, federal and provincial electoral districts in the region are almost all extremely large geographically. The federal electoral district of Sudbury and the provincial electoral districts of Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie are the only ones that are comparable in size to an electoral district in Southern Ontario, while at the other extreme the districts of Kiiwetinoong and Mushkegowuk—James Bay are both geographically larger than the entire United Kingdom. One consequence of this, for example, is that a politician who represents a Northern Ontario riding in the House of Commons of Canada or the Legislative Assembly of Ontario must typically maintain a much higher budget for travel and office expenses than one who represents a small urban district does.

===Secession movements===

Ongoing high unemployment, lack of awareness of or concern for Northern Ontario&#x27;s problems, and difficulties in achieving economic diversification have led to discontent amongst Northern Ontarians; throughout the region&#x27;s history, there have been various movements proposing that the region secede from Ontario to form its own separate province or territory within Canada. The first to raise the issue of secession was Simon James Dawson in 1875, then the representative of the Algoma district in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Then, a movement emerged in Sudbury in the 1890s, when the provincial government began taxing mines; a second movement emerged following the creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan in 1905. In the 1940s, an organization called the New Province League formed to lobby for the creation of a new territory of &quot;Aurora&quot;.

In 1966, a committee of mayors from the region, comprising Max Silverman of Sudbury, G. W. Maybury of Kapuskasing, Ernest Reid of Fort William, Leo Del Villano of Timmins, Merle Dickerson of North Bay and Leo Foucault of Espanola, formed to study the feasibility of Northern Ontario forming a new province.

In the late 1970s, North Bay businessman and city councillor Ed Deibel formed the Northern Ontario Heritage Party to lobby for the formation of a separate province of Northern Ontario. The party attracted only modest support and folded in 1984, but was reestablished in 2010. Both the party&#x27;s original and revived forms have varied their platforms at different times, sometimes advocating for full independence of the region and other times lobbying for measures to increase the region&#x27;s power over its own affairs within the province, including increasing the number of Northern Ontario electoral districts in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and the creation of a special district for the region&#x27;s First Nations voters.

In 1999 the Northeastern Ontario Municipal Association, a committee consisting of the mayors of 14 Northern Ontario municipalities, wrote a letter to Prime Minister Jean Chrétien asking him to outline the necessary conditions for the region to secede from Ontario to form a new province. This movement emerged as a reaction to the government of Mike Harris, whose policies were widely unpopular in the region even though Harris himself represented the Northern Ontario riding of Nipissing in the legislature.

More recently, some residents of the city of Kenora have called for the city or the wider region to secede from Ontario and join Manitoba. A few residents throughout the region continue to suggest splitting all or part of the region into a separate province. The latter movement, known as the Northern Ontario Secession Movement, has begun to attract attention and support; most notably by the mayors of Kenora and Fort Frances. The crisis in the Ontario forest industry, and the perceived inaction by the provincial government, has in particular spurred support for the idea of secession. In particular, many residents feel that the industrial energy rate is too high to allow the industry to remain competitive.

While also stopping short of advocating for full independence, Sudbury&#x27;s &quot;Northern Life&quot; community newspaper published a number of editorials in the 2010s calling on the province to create a new level of supraregional government that would give the Northern Ontario region significantly more autonomy over its own affairs within the province. In the 2013 Ontario Liberal Party leadership race, candidate Glen Murray similarly proposed a distinct level of supraregional government for Northern Ontario.

==Education==
The region is home to five universities: Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Laurentian University in Sudbury, Nipissing University in North Bay, Algoma University in Sault Ste. Marie, and the Université de Hearst in Hearst, Kapuskasing and Timmins. All except Lakehead began as federated schools of Laurentian University, before being rechartered as independent universities at different times.

The region also has six colleges: Confederation College in Thunder Bay, Sault College in Sault Ste. Marie, Northern College in Timmins, Canadore College in North Bay, and the anglophone Cambrian College and francophone Collège Boréal in Sudbury. Several of the colleges also have satellite campuses in smaller Northern Ontario communities.

A large distance education network, Contact North, also operates from Sudbury and Thunder Bay to provide educational services to small and remote Northern Ontario communities.

The Northern Ontario School of Medicine opened in 2005. Initially a joint faculty of Laurentian and Lakehead universities, it became a standalone university in 2022 dually based in Sudbury and Thunder Bay. NOSM has clinical placements throughout Northern Ontario and a special research focus on rural medicine. In 2011, Laurentian University was granted a charter to launch the McEwen School of Architecture in Sudbury, and Lakehead University was granted approval to launch the Bora Laskin Faculty of Law in Thunder Bay. As with the Northern Ontario School of Medicine, each was the first school of its type ever established in the region, as well as the first new school of its type launched in Ontario since the 1960s.

==Culture==
Outdoor recreation is popular in the region year-round. In summer, fishing, boating, canoeing, ATVing, and camping are enjoyed by residents. Hunting remains popular in autumn, especially for moose, whitetail deer, and grouse, although goose hunting is exceptionally popular near James Bay. Group hunting for moose is a favourite social outing. In winter, snowmobiling, ice fishing, outdoor shinny, cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing are popular activities. The region boasts extensive snowmobiling trails and many lakes are dotted with ice hut villages throughout the winter.

The region is home to numerous major cultural events, including Sudbury&#x27;s La Nuit sur l&#x27;étang, Northern Lights Festival Boréal and Cinéfest, the Festival of the Sound in Parry Sound and the Red Rock Folk Festival in Red Rock. Many communities host festivals celebrating local ethnic groups such as French, Métis, First Nations, Finnish, and Italian. Other communities have celebrations of unique local heritage such as Kapuskasing&#x27;s Lumberjack Days, Mattawa&#x27;s Voyageur Days, Sioux Lookout&#x27;s Blueberry Festival, Elliot Lake&#x27;s Uranium Heritage Days, and Red Lake&#x27;s Norseman Festival. Even the smallest First Nations in the region will have an annual pow wow, which bring in many people from outside the community as well, although by far the largest and most famous powwow in the region is held in Wiikwemkoong on Manitoulin Island. In winter, many towns will host a winter carnival celebrating the cold weather; the largest of these is Sault Ste. Marie&#x27;s Bon Soo Winter Carnival.

As of 2017, LGBT pride events take place in Sudbury (Sudbury Pride), Thunder Bay (Thunder Pride), Sault Ste. Marie, North Bay, Timmins, Elliot Lake and Kenora.

There is no single regional culinary dish. Fish and wild game, such as walleye (pickerel) and moose, can be considered regional favourites. Roadside chip trucks are popular choices for meals for locals and tourists alike, and almost every community has at least one. Poutine, which originated in Quebec with early adoption in Northern Ontario, is a core dish at these and many other restaurants.

Italian cuisine has had an influence on the culture of Northeastern Ontario, with porchetta considered a culinary signature of Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie, while Thunder Bay&#x27;s food culture is distinctively Finnish, with the Hoito restaurant known internationally for its Finnish-style pancakes and other traditional Finnish dishes.

Chinese Canadian restaurants have been common in every city and many smaller settlements in Northern Ontario since the early 20th century, satisfying &quot;the ubiquitous Northern demand for Chinese food,&quot; albeit often heavily Westernized.

Although maple syrup is not produced in most of Northern Ontario, it is still made in some areas near North Bay, Sudbury, Manitoulin Island, and Sault Ste. Marie. St. Joseph Island near Sault Ste. Marie is noted for the large quantity of maple syrup produced there.

Since the demise of Northern Breweries, formerly the region&#x27;s primary local brewery, in 2006, several new local craft brewers have emerged in the region, including Stack Brewing in Sudbury, OutSpoken Brewing and Northern Superior Brewing in Sault Ste. Marie, Sleeping Giant Brewing and Dawson Trail Craft Brewery in Thunder Bay, Lake of the Woods Brewing in Kenora, Manitoulin Brewing in Little Current, New Ontario Brewing Company in North Bay, and Full Beard Brewing in Timmins.

==Sports==
Although many sports are played in the region, ice hockey and curling are the most popular. Almost every community is home to both a hockey and curling rink. In fact, Northern Ontario is the only provincial or territorial subregion in Canada that sends its own teams to the Brier and the Tournament of Hearts separately from its province. Hockey is often played on artificial outdoor rinks, and sometimes on frozen lakes.

The North Bay Battalion, Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, and Sudbury Wolves play in the Ontario Hockey League at the Major Junior level. The Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League and Superior International Junior Hockey League operate at the Junior A level and the Lakehead Junior Hockey League at Junior B.

The Algoma Thunderbirds, Lakehead Thunderwolves, Laurentian Voyageurs, and Nipissing Lakers compete in U Sports as members of Ontario University Athletics.

Also, the Thunder Bay Chill soccer teams play in North America&#x27;s USL League Two.

Northern Ontario has hosted the 1981 Canada Summer Games, 1988 World Junior Championships in Athletics, FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1995 and 2003 Continental Cup of Curling.

In 2018, the Sudbury Five were launched in the National Basketball League of Canada.

==Media==

As of 2017, only the CTV and Global networks have comprehensive terrestrial coverage in Northern Ontario, while services such as CBC Television, City, CTV Two, TVOntario, TFO and Ici Radio-Canada Télé are available almost exclusively via cable carriage of stations from Toronto. In the northeast, the four CTV Northern Ontario stations are the only television stations with locally based studios, while the region receives Global and CHCH-TV via rebroadcast transmitters; in Thunder Bay, where Dougall Media&#x27;s two television stations are the only locally owned twinstick operation remaining in English Canada, one station operates as a Global affiliate while the other switched its affiliation from CBC to CTV on September 1, 2014.

Daily newspapers in the region include the &quot;Sudbury Star&quot;, the &quot;Chronicle-Journal&quot; in Thunder Bay, the &quot;Sault Star&quot; in Sault Ste. Marie, the &quot;North Bay Nugget&quot;, the &quot;Timmins Daily Press&quot; and the &quot;Kenora Daily Miner and News&quot;. &quot;The Chronicle-Journal&quot; is owned by Continental Newspapers, and all of the other daily newspapers are owned by Postmedia. Community newspapers include &quot;Northern Life&quot; in Sudbury, &quot;Northern News&quot; in Kirkland Lake, &quot;Thunder Bay&#x27;s Source&quot;, the &quot;Dryden Observer&quot;, &quot;Sault This Week&quot;, the &quot;Mid-North Monitor&quot; in Espanola, the &quot;Manitoulin Expositor&quot; on Manitoulin Island and the Village Media network of web hyperlocals.

Noted magazines published in the region include &quot;HighGrader&quot;, &quot;Northern Ontario Business&quot; and &quot;Sudbury Living&quot;.

Most commercial radio stations in Northern Ontario are owned by the national radio groups Rogers Communications, Vista Broadcast Group, Bell Media or Stingray Group, although a few independent and community broadcasters are represented as well. CBC Radio One has stations in Sudbury (CBCS), with rebroadcasters throughout Northeastern Ontario, and in Thunder Bay (CBQT), with rebroadcasters in the Northwest. The French Ici Radio-Canada Première has a station in Sudbury (CBON), with rebroadcasters throughout Northern Ontario. CBC Music is currently heard &quot;only&quot; in Sudbury (CBBS) and Thunder Bay (CBQ), and the French Ici Musique is currently heard only in Sudbury (CBBX).

Cable television service is provided by Shaw Cable in Sault Ste. Marie and virtually all of Northwestern Ontario, by Cogeco in North Bay, and by EastLink in Northeastern Ontario apart from North Bay and Sault Ste. Marie.

In December 1951, CFCL went to air, broadcasting from Timmins. The first French-language radio station in Ontario, reached listeners from Kirkland Lake to Hearst, showcasing local talent and creating a sense of community among the widely dispersed francophone population of Northern Ontario. Until then greeted with enthusiasm by Franco-Ontarians who until then had heard limited programming in French over the airwaves.

==Demographics==

The mining boom of the early twentieth century attracted many francophones to Northeastern Ontario, and French is still widely spoken there. While the Canadian constitution never required the province of Ontario to recognize French as an official language, the government provides full services in the French language to any citizen, resident, or visitor wishing it including communications, schools, hospitals, social services, and in the courts, under the French Language Services Act of 1986. Bilingualism is higher than the Canadian average – in 2011, 180,020 people, or 24.6% of the population, spoke both English and French. There were also 8,910 people, or 1.2% of the population, who only spoke French. All of Northeastern Ontario, with the technical exception of Manitoulin Island, is designated as a French language service area, as are a few individual municipalities in the Northwest; Manitoulin Island, while not officially designated as a French language service area, effectively functions as one anyway since it receives most provincial government services from the designated Sudbury District seat in Espanola rather than functioning as its own jurisdictional area.

The government of Canada provides French and English equally in all matters. In 2011, 10.2% of people in Northern Ontario spoke French most often at home, mostly in Northeastern Ontario.

The 2016 Canadian Census found that the population of Northern Ontario was 780,140. During the Canada 2011 Census, data was not included from 17 incompletely enumerated Indian Reserves across the region. Four reserves were not counted due to permission not being given, and another 13 in Northwestern Ontario were not counted due to evacuations caused by forest fires. The census was later adjusted with the figures for these reserves showing a total population of 11,435. The median age for Northern Ontario in 2011 was 43.9. There were 43,670 immigrants in 2011, representing 5.8% of the population, down from 6.8% in 2006.

The region also has a significant First Nations population, primarily of the Ojibwe, Cree and Oji-Cree nations, with smaller communities of Nipissing, Algonquin, Odawa and Saulteaux.

In 2016, Northwestern Ontario was 71% white, 26.2% indigenous and 2.8% visible minorities. The largest visible minority groups in the region were South Asian (0.5%), Black (0.4%), Chinese (0.4%), Filipino (0.4%) and Southeast Asian (0.3%) Northeastern Ontario was 82.5% white, 15% indigenous and 2.5% visible minorities. The largest visible minority groups were South Asian (0.6%), Black (0.6%) and Chinese (0.4%).

A 2001 census showed Catholicism as the most commonly practiced religion in Northern Ontario (50.8%). The Precious Blood Cathedral in Sault Ste. Marie is the official cathedral for the diocese. However, the Pro-Cathedral of the Assumption in North Bay acts as the unofficial Episcopal See for the Diocese of Sault Sainte Marie.  

The languages that had at least 1,000 native speakers (single mother-tongue response) in Northern Ontario in 2006 were:

Religion in Northern Ontario at the 2001 census
Note: Other religions mostly native spirituality
Out-migration from Northern Ontario especially of young and working-age adults, either intraprovincially to Southern Ontario or interprovincially especially to Western Canada, has been a prominent public issue since the 1990s.

<doc id="211016" wikidata="Q16409211" url="?curid=211016" title="Estonian orthography">
<text>Estonian [[orthography]] is the system used for writing the Estonian language and is based on the Latin alphabet. The Estonian orthography is generally guided by phonemic principles, with each grapheme corresponding to one phoneme.

==Alphabet==
Due to German and Swedish influence, the Estonian alphabet () has the letters Ä, Ö, and Ü (A, O, and U with diaeresis), which represent the vowel sounds , and , respectively. Unlike German umlauts, they are considered, and alphabetised as, separate letters. The most distinctive letter in the Estonian alphabet, however, is the Õ (O with tilde), which was added to the alphabet in the 19th century by Otto Wilhelm Masing and stands for the vowel . In addition, the alphabet also differs from the Latin alphabet by the addition of the letters Š and Ž (S and Z with caron/háček), and by the position of Z in the alphabet: it has been moved from the end to between S and T (or Š and Ž).

The official Estonian alphabet has 27 letters: A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, Š, Z, Ž, T, U, V, Õ, Ä, Ö, Ü. The letters F, Š, Z, Ž are so-called &quot;foreign letters&quot; (), and occur only in loanwords and foreign proper names. Occasionally, the alphabet is recited without them, and thus has only 23 letters: A, B, D, E, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, V, Õ, Ä, Ö, Ü.

Additionally &quot;C&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, and &quot;Y&quot; are used in writing foreign proper names. They do not occur in Estonian words, and are not officially part of the alphabet. Including all the foreign letters, the alphabet consists of the following 32 letters:
In Blackletter script W was used instead of V. In some reference works (e.g. the &quot;Estonian Soviet Encyclopedia&quot;), V and W were sorted as if they were one and the same letter.

Johannes Aavik suggested that the letter Ü be replaced by Y, as it has been in the Finnish alphabet.

Double letters are used to write half-long and overlong vowels and consonants, e. g. &quot;aa&quot; or , &quot;nn&quot; or , &quot;kk&quot; . For more information, see below.

As the distinction between voiced and voiceless plosives is not native to Estonian, the names of the letters &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;d&#x27;, &#x27;g&#x27; may be pronounced , , , so the letters &#x27;b&#x27; and &#x27;d&#x27; are also named () and () to distinguish them from () and (). About usage of these letters, see below.

==Orthographic principles==
Although Estonian orthography is generally guided by phonemic principles, with each grapheme corresponding to one phoneme, there are some historical and morphological deviations from this: for example the initial letter &quot;h&quot; in words, preservation of the morpheme in declension of the word (writing &quot;b&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;d&quot; in places where &quot;p&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;t&quot; is pronounced) and in the use of &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;. Where it is impractical or impossible to type &quot;š&quot; and &quot;ž&quot;, they are substituted with &quot;sh&quot; and &quot;zh&quot; in some written texts, although this is considered incorrect. Otherwise, the &quot;h&quot; in &quot;sh&quot; represents a voiceless glottal fricative, as in (&quot;pas-ha&quot;); this also applies to some foreign names.

Some features of the modern Estonian orthography are:
* Word-initial &quot;b, d, g&quot; occur only in loanwords and are normally pronounced as , , . Some old loanwords are spelled with &quot;p, t, k&quot; instead of etymological &quot;b, d, g&quot;: &#x27;bank&#x27;. Word-medially and word-finally, &quot;b, d, g&quot; represent short plosives (may be pronounced as partially voiced consonants), &quot;p, t, k&quot; represent half-long plosives , and &quot;pp, tt, kk&quot; represent overlong plosives ; for example: &#x27;hoof&#x27; — &#x27;wardrobe&#x27; [ ] — &#x27;wardrobe [ ]&#x27;.
* Before and after &quot;b, p, d, t, g, k, s, h, f, š, z, ž&quot;, the sounds , , are written as &quot;p, t, k&quot;, with some exceptions due to morphology or etymology. For example, the suffixed particle &quot;-gi&quot; &#x27;too, also&#x27; may become &quot;-ki&quot;, but does not alter the spelling of the stem, so &#x27;desert&#x27; + &quot;-gi&quot; becomes .
* Word-initial is usually dropped in spontaneous speech, but should be represented in writing.
* The letter &quot;j&quot; is used at the beginning of syllables, but &quot;i&quot; is used at the end of diphthongs. Double &quot;j&quot; is used only in some illative case forms. The spelling &quot;üü&quot; before vowels corresponds to the pronunciation : &#x27;he sells&#x27; (from &#x27;to sell&#x27;). The spelling &quot;üi&quot; is used only in the loanwords , , . Between &quot;i&quot; and vowels, the epenthetic sound is pronounced but not written. It is, however, written in the suffix &quot;-ja&quot;.
* Vowels and the consonants &quot;h, j, l, m, n, r, s, v&quot; are written single when they are short, double when they are half-long or overlong: &#x27;blood [ ]&#x27; — &#x27;edge [ ]&#x27; — &#x27;roll [ ]&#x27;, &#x27;sheet&#x27; — &#x27;town [ ]&#x27; — &#x27;town [ ]&#x27;.
* Diphthongs and consonant combinations are written as combinations of single letters, regardless of whether they are pronounced short or long. Only &quot;s&quot; after &quot;l, m, n, r&quot; may be doubled if not followed by another consonant ( &#x27;waltz&#x27;), otherwise combinations &quot;consonant+double consonant&quot; and &quot;double consonant+consonant&quot; occur only in morpheme boundaries, e. g. &#x27;modern&#x27; (&quot;-ne&quot; is a suffix), &#x27;cardboard box&#x27; (from &#x27;cardboard&#x27; and &#x27;box&#x27;). However, a double consonant at the end of a root is simplified before a suffix beginning with a consonant (except &quot;-gi/-ki&quot;): &#x27;townsman&#x27; (from &#x27;town&#x27;).
* The single word-medial or word-final letters &quot;f&quot; and &quot;š&quot; represent half-long consonants , the double letters &quot;ff&quot; and &quot;šš&quot; represent overlong consonants . After consonants, &quot;f&quot; and &quot;š&quot; are always written single, regardless of whether they are pronounced half-long or overlong.
* Palatalization is not indicated in writing, e. g. &#x27;jug&#x27; — &#x27;toy&#x27;. It occurs in words that have &quot;i&quot; in declension: &#x27;toy [ and ]&#x27;.
* Stress is not indicated in writing. Usually it falls on the first syllable, but there are a few exceptions with the stress on the second syllable: &#x27;thanks&#x27;, &#x27;female friend&#x27;. Often the original stress is preserved in loanwords, such as &#x27;ideal&#x27;, &#x27;professor&#x27;; presence of long vowels (as in ) also shows stress.

==Syllabification==
One consonant between two vowels belongs to the following syllable: &#x27;fish&#x27; is syllabified &quot;ka-la&quot;. Consonant combinations are syllabified before the last consonant: &#x27;town [ ]&#x27; is syllabified &quot;lin-na&quot;, &#x27;acquaintance&#x27; is syllabified . Consonant digraphs and trigraphs in foreign names are regarded as single consonants: is syllabified &quot;Man-ches-ter&quot;. Two vowels usually form a long vowel or a diphthong, e. g. &#x27;song&#x27; is syllabified &quot;lau-lu&quot;. However, a hiatus is formed in morpheme bounds, e. g. &#x27;opening&#x27; is syllabified &quot;a-va-us&quot; as the word is composed from the root &quot;ava-&quot; and the suffix &quot;-us&quot;. Combinations of three vowel letters represent a hiatus of a long vowel or a diphthong and another vowel, e. g. &#x27;dry, droughty, arid (lacking rain)&#x27; is syllabified &quot;põu-a-ne&quot;; but some loanwords have a hiatus of a short vowel followed by a long vowel: &#x27;oasis&#x27; is syllabified &quot;o-aas&quot;. Compound words are syllabified as combinations of their parts: &#x27;grandmother&#x27; is syllabified as &quot;va-na-e-ma&quot; as the word is composed from &#x27;old&#x27; and &#x27;mother&#x27;. Etymologically compound loanwords and foreign names may be syllabified as compound or simple words: &#x27;photographer&#x27; is syllabified &quot;fo-to-graaf&quot; or &quot;fo-tog-raaf&quot;, is syllabified &quot;Pet-ro-grad&quot; or &quot;Pet-rog-rad&quot;.

These syllabification rules are used for hyphenating words at the end of line, with the additional rule that a single letter is not left on a line.

==Foreign words==
Loanwords are normally adapted to Estonian spelling: &#x27;web&#x27;, &#x27;jazz&#x27;. However, foreign words and phrases sometimes may be used in the original spelling, such as Latin phrases, Italian musical terms, exotic words. Such citations are typographically emphasized using italics and declined using an apostrophe: &quot;croissant&quot;&#x27;id &#x27;croissants&#x27;.

Foreign proper names from Latin-script languages are written in their original spelling: &quot;Margaret Thatcher, Bordeaux&quot;. Names from non-Latin-script languages are written using either Estonian orthographic transcription or established romanization systems. Some geographical names (and some names of historical personalities, such as monarchs) have traditional Estonian forms (including some adapted spellings such as for German &#x27;Vienna&#x27;).

Derivations from foreign proper names with the suffixes &quot;-lik, -lane, -lus, -ism, -ist&quot; usually conserve the spelling of names (e. g. , ), but a few are adapted by established tradition: , , . Derivations without suffixes or with other suffixes are adapted to Estonian spelling: &#x27;newton&#x27; (physical unit), &#x27;maxillary sinusitis&#x27; (inflammation of antrum of Highmore), &#x27;ytterbium&#x27;, &#x27;Shakespearologist&#x27;, etc.

Expressions such as &#x27;degree Celsius&#x27;, &#x27;Cheddar cheese&#x27; conserve the spelling of proper names (adding case endings). However, names of plants and animals are usually written in adapted forms, e.g. &#x27;Colorado beetle&#x27;.

Apostrophe is used when adding case endings to proper names with unusual grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences (such as ending on a consonant orthographically but on a vowel phonetically or vice versa), e.g. (genitive of &quot;Provence&quot;).

==Capitalization==
Capital letters are written at the beginning of the first word in a sentence, proper names, and official names functioned as proper names. May be used in the pronouns &#x27;you (singular)&#x27; and &#x27;you (plural, also used as formal singular)&#x27; to show respect.

Names of months, days of the week, holidays, Chinese zodiac years, and titles of people such as are not capitalized.

Titles of books, films, etc. are written in quotation marks with only the first word and proper names capitalized.

==Compound words==
Compound words are written as one word, but they are often composed of genitive+nominative and hard to distinguish from simple word combinations. A compound word is considered a single word and written together when: 1) it has a separate meaning, e. g. &#x27;chapter&#x27; but &#x27;part of a head&#x27;; 2) it is different from the genitive+nominative combination, e. g. (nominative+nominative) &#x27;watermill&#x27;; 3)some combinations may be together or separately, but writing them together is preferred in more complex word phrases: &#x27;member of a party&#x27; — &#x27;every member of the party&#x27;. Rare and long word combinations are typically written separately.

The hyphen is used: 1) in compounds where one of the parts is a letter ( &#x27;vitamin C&#x27;), an initialism ( &#x27;text TV&#x27;), a foreign citation ( &#x27;joke show&#x27;) or a word part ( &#x27;word containing ); 2) in compound adjectives where the first part as a proper name; 3) in compound geographical names such as &#x27;South Estonia&#x27;; 4) as a suspended hyphen, e.g. &#x27;gold and silver things&#x27; (also in compound words such as &#x27;export-import bank&#x27;); 5) in &quot;nominative+ablative&quot; adverbs, e. g. &#x27;day after day&#x27;; 6) in dvandva compounds, e. g. &#x27;father and mother&#x27;; 7) in compound adjectives from word phrases, e.g. &#x27;related to tentative phonetics&#x27;; 8) in compound adjectives with coordinating meaning, e.g. &#x27;Estonian-English dictionary&#x27;; 9) in double names such as . It can be optionally used in unusual compounds such as &#x27;gooseberry disease&#x27;; in compounds with three or four identical letters in a row (e. g. &#x27;yearly&#x27;, &#x27;bone groove&#x27;); in compounds with numbers (see below) or with signs (e.g. &#x27;+ sign&#x27;); in the construction &#x27;genitive of a proper name + nominative&#x27; after another genitive (e. g. &#x27;European part of Russia&#x27;); in the colloquial construction &#x27;genitive of a proper name + noun&#x27; instead of &#x27;noun + proper name&#x27;, e. g. instead of &#x27;Uncle Kuusk&#x27;; in ad hoc compounds such as ; in words from two-or-more-component proper names, e. g. .

==Abbreviations==
The abbreviation period (full stop) may be used, but it is not mandatory. Commonly used abbreviations are usually written without the abbreviation period: , , or for &#x27;street&#x27;; for &#x27;see&#x27;; for &#x27;and many others&#x27;. Using the abbreviation period is recommended when an abbreviation may be misread as another word: for &#x27;figure, draft&#x27; but &#x27;line&#x27;. If an abbreviation of a word phrase may be mistaken for a word or for another abbreviation, periods are used after every letter but the last one, and spaces are not used: for but &#x27;mother&#x27;, for but for &#x27;economy&#x27;.

The hyphen is used in some abbreviations of compound words, e. g. for &#x27;doctor of pedagogy&#x27;, for &#x27;capitan lieutenant&#x27;, especially in the construction &quot;abbreviation + complete word&quot;, such as for &#x27;reinforced concrete panels&#x27;.

==Numerals==
Numerals may be written in words ( &#x27;one&#x27;, &#x27;two&#x27;, &#x27;three&#x27;...) or in figures (1, 2, 3, ...). In Estonian texts, the comma is used as the decimal separator, and the space is used as thousands separator (in financial documents, the point can be used as thousands separator to avoid inserting an extra digit). The point as a separator is used for dates, daytime, prices, and sports results in meters and centimeters. For prices in euros and cents, writing &quot;€ 84.95&quot; as well as &quot;84,95 €&quot; is accepted. Daytime in hours and minutes (24-hour format) may be written using the point or the colon (without spaces): &quot;16.15&quot; or &quot;16:15&quot;; but seconds are separated by the point: &quot;16:15.25&quot;. The colon with spaces is used for ratios. e. g. &quot;2 : 3&quot;.

When written in words, numerals with or (11 to 19), (tens) and (hundreds) are written together, e.g. &#x27;fifteen&#x27;, &#x27;fifty&#x27;, &#x27;five hundred&#x27;. Other compound numerals are written separately: &#x27;twenty-five&#x27;.

For writing ordinal numbers in figures, the ordinal dot is used: &quot;16.&quot; for &#x27;the sixteenth&#x27;. In some cases, ordinals are written as Roman numerals (without the ordinal dot). Roman numerals followed by a dot may be used in numbered lists.

Case forms of cardinal and ordinal numerals may be written in the form &quot;figures+case ending&quot; with or without a hyphen: &quot;16s&quot; or &quot;16-s&quot; for &#x27;sixteen [inessive]&#x27;, or for &#x27;the sixteenth [inessive]&#x27;. For case endings beginning with the letter &quot;l&quot;, the hyphen is mandatory to avoid confusion with the digit 1: &quot;16-le&quot; for &#x27;sixteen [allative]&#x27;. Case endings after figures are not used when a cardinal or ordinal numeral is in a case concordance with a following noun. Likewise, compound words with numbers written in figures may be written with or without the hyphen: or for &#x27;60-watt light&#x27;.

==Punctuation==
The period (full stop) is used at the end of sentences, as an ordinal mark and sometimes as an abbreviation mark and as a number separator (see above).

The comma is used for appositions (but appositions in genitive require the comma only before them), for more than one attribute after a determined word, for enumerations (but the serial comma is not used), between coordinated or subordinated clauses, between direct speech and author&#x27;s words, before and after parenthetic or vocative phrases, and before and after some other constructions. It is also used between placenames and dates in the nominative case (but not in locative cases); between a surname and a given name, if they are written in this order; before parts of and address; and as a decimal mark.

The colon is used before lists, before direct speech, before explanations, and also in writing daytime and ratios (see above).

The semicolon is used between weakly related parts of sentences, especially containing commas.

The hyphen is used for writing compound words (see above). It is also used for hyphenating words at the end of line, for declining letters and abbreviations, and optionally for declining acronyms/initialisms, numbers, and symbols.

The dash is used when there appears a generalizing word after an enumeration; instead of the comma for accenting clauses and appositions or for relatively long parenthetical constructions; before words indicating surprise; for slight pauses (interchangeably with the ellipsis); in the meaning &quot;from...to&quot; (instead of the word &quot;kuni&quot;); for indicating lines or routes (when in attributive function, the hyphen is also accepted); between coordinated attributes if at least one attribute has a hyphen or a space; between remarks of a dialogue written as one line without author&#x27;s words; as a marker before enumeration items. The dash is not used to indicate omission of a word that would be repeated.

The exclamation and question marks are used at the end of exclamative and interrogative sentences. Occasionally, they may be parenthesized and written after words within sentences to show doubt or surprise. The exclamation mark is also used for addressing people in letters, e.g. . Using the comma or the colon in this case is considered inappropriate.

The quotation marks, written as „ ”, are used for direct speech, citations, scare quotes, and names of books, documents, episodes, enterprises, etc. Names of plant sorts may be written in double or in single quotation marks (looking like apostrophes: ’ ’) and are normally italicized. For cited words and phrases, including words in a linguistic context, quotation marks or italics may be used. Quotation marks are not used in the names of institutions, periodicals, awards, wares, and vehicles.

The apostrophe is used for adding case endings and suffixes to foreign names with unusual grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences and to foreign citations in the original spelling (see above). Sometimes the apostrophe is used for adding case endings and suffixes to Estonian names, to make the original form clear: (allative of the surname ), (the apostrophe is used to conserve the spelling of the surname , otherwise the double consonant would become a single consonant). Also, the apostrophe is sometimes used in poetry to indicate omission of a sound: , , instead of , , are found in Lydia Koidula&#x27;s poems. Single quotation marks (&#x27; &#x27;) are used for word meanings in a linguistic context.

The parentheses are used for parenthetical words or sentences, and also for optional parts of words in a linguistic context.

The square brackets are used for citer&#x27;s notes to citations and for showing pronunciation in linguistic and reference works.

The slash is used for division in fractions and unit symbols, for connecting alternatives, to show line breaks when citing poetry in the single-line format, and for non-calendar years. In practice, it occasionally appears in abbreviations made of more than one word (e. g. for &#x27;school year&#x27;), but this usage is considered nonstandard (correct abbreviation: ). Spaces are used before and after the slash only if it separates text fragments of more than one word.

The ellipsis is used for slight pauses and for unfinished thoughts. It is surrounded by spaces. Also, the ellipsis is used for bowdlerizing obscene words.

==History==
Modern Estonian orthography is based on the &quot;Newer Orthography&quot; created by Eduard Ahrens in the second half of the 19th century based on Finnish orthography. The &quot;Older Orthography&quot; it replaced was created in the 17th century by Bengt Gottfried Forselius and Johann Hornung based on standard German orthography. In the old orthography, single consonants following short vowels were written double even if they are short ( &#x27;fish&#x27; was written as ) and long vowels in an open syllable were written single ( &#x27;to create&#x27; was written as ). Before Otto Wilhelm Masing introduced the letter &quot;õ&quot; in the early 19th century, its sound had not been distinguished in writing from &quot;ö&quot;. Earlier writing in Estonian had by and large used an ad hoc orthography based on Latin and Middle Low German orthography. Some influences of the standard German orthography — for example, writing &quot;W&quot;/&quot;w&quot; instead of &quot;V&quot;/&quot;v&quot; persisted well into the 1930s.

In Fraktur typesetting (which was common in Estonian publications before the first half of the 20th century), two kinds of the small letter &quot;s&quot; were distinguished: the short &quot;s&quot; and the long &quot;ſ&quot;. The long &quot;ſ&quot; was used at the beginning and in the middle of syllables, and the short &quot;s&quot; was used at the end of syllables. For example: &#x27;cat&#x27; — &#x27;cat [gen. sg., part. sg.]&#x27;.

Estonian words and names quoted in international publications from Soviet sources were often back-transliterations from the Russian transliteration. Examples are the use of я (&quot;ya&quot;) for ä (e.g. Pyarnu (Пярну) for Pärnu), ы (&quot;y&quot;) for õ (e.g., Pylva (Пылва) for Põlva) and ю (&quot;yu&quot;) for ü (e.g., Pyussi (Пюсси) for Püssi). Even in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; one can find &quot;ostrov Khiuma&quot;, where means &#x27;island&#x27; in Russian and &quot;Khiuma&quot; is back-transliteration from Russian instead of &quot;Hiiumaa&quot; (&quot;Hiiumaa &gt; Хийума(а) &gt; Khiuma&quot;).

<doc id="211017" wikidata="Q385545" url="?curid=211017" title="Decimalisation">
<text>Decimalisation or decimalization (see spelling differences) is the conversion of a system of currency or of weights and measures to units related by powers of 10.

Most countries have decimalised their currencies, converting them from non-decimal sub-units to a decimal system, with one basic currency unit and sub-units that are valued relative to the basic unit by a power of 10, most commonly 100 and exceptionally 1000, and sometimes at the same time, changing the name of the currency and/or the conversion rate to the new currency. 

Today, only two countries have &quot;de jure&quot; non-decimal currencies, these being Mauritania (where 1 ouguiya = 5 khoums) and Madagascar (where 1 ariary = 5 iraimbilanja): however, these currencies are &quot;de facto&quot; decimal as the value of both currencies&#x27; main unit is now so low that the sub-units are too small to be of any practical use, and coins of these sub-units are no longer used. 

Russia was the first country to convert to a decimal currency when it decimalised under Tsar Peter the Great in 1704, resulting in the silver ruble being equal to 100 copper kopeks.

For weights and measures, this is also called metrication, replacing traditional units that are related in other ways, such as those formed by successive doubling or halving, or by more arbitrary conversion factors. Units of physical measurement, such as length and mass, were decimalised with the introduction of the metric system, which has been adopted by almost all countries (with the prominent exceptions of the United States, and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom and Canada). Thus, a kilometre is 1000 metres, while a mile is 1,760 yards. Electrical units are decimalised worldwide. 

Common units of time remain undecimalised; although an attempt to do so was made during the French Revolution, this proved to be unsuccessful and was quickly abandoned.

== Currency decimalisation by region ==

Decimal currencies have sub-units based on a power of 10. Most sub-units are one-100th of the base currency unit, but currencies based on 1,000 sub-units also exist in several Arab countries.

Some countries changed the name of the base unit when they decimalised their currency, including:

===Europe===
In 1534 the kopek of Novgorod was equated to 1/100 of the ruble of Moscow, thus making the Russian ruble Europe&#x27;s first decimal currency. In the 18th century were introduced the coins grivennik (10 kopeks) and imperial (10 rubles). This was not quite decimal currencies as they are known today, as there were smaller units beneath the kopek itself: the denga (half a kopek, or 200 to the ruble) and the polushka (half a denga, one-quarter kopek, or 400 to the ruble). After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union transitioned to a purely decimal model by eliminating the non-decimal subdivisions of the kopek.

France introduced the franc in 1795 to replace the livre tournois, abolished during the French Revolution. France introduced decimalisation in a number of countries that it invaded during the Napoleonic period.

The Dutch guilder decimalised in 1817, becoming equal to 100 centen (instead of 20 stuivers = 160 duiten = 320 penningen), with the last pre-decimal coins withdrawn from circulation in 1848.

Sweden introduced decimal currency in 1855. The riksdaler was divided into 100 öre. The riksdaler was renamed the krona in 1873.

The Austro-Hungarian Empire decimalised the gulden in 1857, concurrent with its transition from the Conventionsthaler to the Vereinsthaler standard.

Spain introduced its decimal currency unit, the peseta, in 1868, replacing all previous currencies.

Cyprus decimalised the Cypriot pound in 1955, which comprised 1000 mils, later replaced by 100 cents.

The United Kingdom (including its overseas territories) and Ireland decimalised sterling and the Irish pound, respectively, in 1971. (See £sd and Decimal Day.)

Malta decimalised the lira in 1972.

===The Americas===

==== North America ====
===== United States =====
Decimalisation was introduced into the Thirteen Colonies by the American Revolution, and then enshrined in US law by the Coinage Act of 1792.

===== Canada =====
Decimalisation in Canada was complicated by the different jurisdictions before Confederation in 1867. In 1841, the united Province of Canada&#x27;s Governor General, Lord Sydenham, argued for establishment of a bank that would issue dollar currency (the Canadian dollar). Francis Hincks, who would become the Province of Canada&#x27;s Prime Minister in 1851, favoured the plan. Ultimately the provincial assembly rejected the proposal. In June 1851, the Canadian legislature passed a law requiring provincial accounts to be kept decimalised as dollars and cents. The establishment of a central bank was not touched upon in the 1851 legislation. The British government delayed the implementation of the currency change on a technicality, wishing to distinguish the Canadian currency from the United States&#x27; currency by referencing the units as &quot;Royals&quot; rather than &quot;Dollars&quot;. The British delay was overcome by the Currency Act of 1 August 1854. In 1858, coins denominated in cents and imprinted with &quot;Canada&quot; were issued for the first time.

Decimalisation occurred in:

The colonial elite, the main advocates of decimalisation, based their case on two main arguments. The first was for facilitation of trade and economic ties with the United States, the colonies&#x27; largest trading partner; the second was to simplify calculations and reduce accounting errors.

===== Mexico =====
The Mexican peso was formally decimalised in the 1860s with the introduction of coins denominated in centavos; however, the currency did not fully decimalise in practice immediately and pre-decimal reales were issued until 1897.

===== Bermuda =====
Bermuda decimalised in 1970, by introducing the Bermudian dollar equal to 8 shillings 4 pence (100 pence, effectively equal to the US dollar under the Bretton Woods system).

* The Gambian dalasi decimalised in 1971.
* The Malawian kwacha decimalised in 1971.

==== South Africa ====
The rand was introduced on 14 February 1961. A Decimal Coinage Commission had been set up in 1956 to consider a move away from the denominations of pounds, shillings and pence, submitting its recommendation on 8 August 1958. It replaced the South African pound as legal tender, at the rate of 2 rand = 1 pound or 10 shillings to the rand. Australia, New Zealand and Rhodesia also chose ten shillings as the base unit of their new currency.

===Oceania===

==== Australia and New Zealand ====

Australia decimalised on 14 February 1966, with the Australian dollars replacing the Australian pound. A television campaign containing a memorable jingle, sung to the tune of &quot;Click Go the Shears&quot;, was used to help the public to understand the changes. New Zealand decimalised on 10 July 1967, with the New Zealand dollars replacing the New Zealand pound.

In both countries, the conversion rate was one pound to two dollars and 10 shillings to one dollar.

To ease the transition, the new 5-cent, 10-cent and 20-cents coins were the same size and weight, and the new $1, $2, $10 and $20 banknotes (and the new $100 banknote in New Zealand) were the same colour, as their pre-decimal equivalents. Because of the inexact conversion between cents and pence, people were advised to tender halfpenny, penny and threepence coins in multiples of sixpence (the lowest common multiple of both systems) during the transition.

==== Rest of Oceania ====

*Tongan pa&#x27;anga decimalised on 3 April 1967
*Samoan tala decimalised on 10 July 1967
*Fijian dollar decimalised on 15 January 1969

===Asia===

King Chulalongkorn decimalised the Thai currency in 1897. The tical (baht) is now divided into one hundred satang.

Iran decimalised its currency in 1932, with the rial, subdivided into 100 new dinars, replacing the qiran at par.

Saudi Arabia decimalised the riyal in 1963, with 1 riyal = 100 halalas. Between 1960 and 1963, the riyal was worth 20 qirsh, and before that, it was worth 22 qirsh.

The Yemen Arab Republic introduced the coinage system of 1 North Yemeni rial = 100 fils in 1974, to replace the 1 rial = 40 buqsha = 80 halala = 160 zalat system. The country was one of the last to convert its coinage.

Japan historically had two decimal subdivisions of the yen: the sen (1/100) and the rin (1/1,000). However, they were taken out of circulation as of December 31, 1953, and all transactions are now conducted in multiples of 1 yen.

==== Rupee-anna-pice-pie to Rupee-paisa conversion ====

India changed from the rupee, anna, pie system to decimal currency on 1 April 1957. Pakistan decimalised its currency in 1961.

In India, Pakistan, and other places under British colonization where a system of 1 rupee = 16 anna = 64 pice (old paisa) = 192 pie was used, the decimalisation process defines 1 rupee = 100 naya (new) paisa. The following table shows the conversion of common denominations of coins issued in modern India and Pakistan. 

*Bold denotes the actual denomination written on the coins

Burma (now Myanmar) decimalised in 1952 (predating the Indian case) by changing from the rupee (worth 16 pe, each of 4 pyas) to the kyat (worth 100 pyas).

Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) decimalised in 1869, dividing the rupee into one hundred cents.

===Mauritania and Madagascar===
Mauritania and Madagascar theoretically retain currencies with units whose values are in the ratio five to one: the Mauritanian ouguiya (MRU) is equivalent to five khoums, and the Malagasy ariary (MGA) to five iraimbilanja.

In practice, however, the value of each of these two larger units is very small: as of 2021, the MRU is traded against the euro at about 44:1, and the MGA at about 4,600:1. In each of these countries, the smaller denomination is no longer used, although in Mauritania there is still a &quot;one-fifth ouguiya&quot; coin.

== Non-currency cases ==

=== Securities ===
In the special context of quoting the prices of stocks, traded almost always in blocks of 100 or more shares and usually in blocks of many thousands, stock exchanges in the United States used eighths or sixteenths of dollars, until converting to decimals between September 2000 and April 2001.

Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the prices of government securities continued to be quoted in multiples of of a pound ( d or  p) long after the currency was decimalised.

===Metrication===

The idea of measurement and currency systems where units are related by factors of ten was suggested by Simon Stevin who in 1585 first advocated the use of decimal numbers for everyday purposes. The Metric system was developed in France in the 1790s as part of the reforms introduced during the French Revolution. Its adoption was gradual, both within France and in other countries, but its use is nearly universal today. One aspect of measurement decimalisation was the introduction of metric prefixes to derive bigger and smaller sizes from base unit names. Examples include &quot;kilo&quot; for 1000, &quot;hecto&quot; for 100, &quot;centi&quot; for 1/100 and &quot;milli&quot; for 1/1000. The list of metric prefixes has expanded in modern times to encompass a wider range of measurements.

While the common units of time, minute, hour, day, month and year, are not decimalised, there have been proposals for decimalisation of the time of day and decimal calendar systems. Astronomers use a decimalised Julian day number to record and predict events. Decades, centuries, and millennia are examples of common units of time that are decimalised. The millisecond is a decimalised unit of time equivalent to a thousandth of a second, and is sometimes used in computing contexts.

The gradian or grade is an angular unit defined as one hundredth of the right angle (approximately 0.0157 rad), further divided into one hundred centigrades.

In computer science, there are several metric prefixes used with units of information. For example, a kilobit is equivalent to 1,000 bits.

=== Representing amounts of money ===
Amounts of money are sometimes described in a decimalised way. For example, the letter K (standing for kilo-) can be used to indicate that a sum of money ought to be multiplied by 1,000 i.e. $250k means $250,000. The letters M or MM can be used to indicate that a sum of money should be multiplied by a million i.e. $3.5M means $3,500,000. The letter B similarly stands for a billion.

<text>&quot;Õ&quot; (uppercase), or &quot;õ&quot; (lowercase) is a composition of the Latin letter O with the diacritic mark tilde.

The HTML entity is &quot;&amp;Otilde;&quot; for Õ and &quot;&amp;otilde;&quot; for õ.

== Romagnol ==
For Romagnol language, &quot;õ&quot; is used in some proposed orthographies to represent , e.g. &quot;savõ&quot; &quot;soap&quot;. To this day a unified standardization has not been established.

==Estonian==
In Estonian, &quot;Õ&quot; is the 27th letter of the alphabet (between W and Ä), and it represents a vowel characteristic of Estonian, the unrounded back vowel , which may be close-mid back, close back, or close-mid central. The vowel was previously written with the letter Ö, but in the early 19th century, Otto Wilhelm Masing adopted the letter &quot;Õ&quot;, ending the confusion between several homographs and clearly showing how to pronounce a word.

In informal writing, e.g., emails, instant messaging and when using foreign keyboard layouts where the letter &quot;Õ&quot; is not available, some Estonians use the characters O or 6 to approximate this letter.

In most parts of the island Saaremaa, &quot;Õ&quot; is pronounced the same as &quot;Ö&quot;.

==Guarani==

In the Guarani language, &quot;Õ&quot; is the 22nd letter and fourth nasal vowel of the alphabet, similar to the Spanish &quot;o&quot;, but with a stressed nasalization.

== Hungarian ==
In Hungarian, Õ only appears when a typeface (font set) does not contain a proper &quot;ő&quot; letter, which is an &quot;o&quot; with a double acute diacritic.

==Samogitian==
In Samogitian the letter &quot;Õ&quot; represents, as in Estonian, the unrounded back vowel which is unique to Samogitian and is not found in Standard Lithuanian, this is a rather new innovation brought on by the ensuing efforts of standardising Samogitian, this letter alleviates the confusion between the two distinct pronunciations of the letter ė.

==Portuguese==
In the Portuguese language, the symbol &quot;Õ&quot; stands for a nasal close-mid back rounded vowel, also written in IPA. It is not considered an independent letter of the alphabet: the tilde is the standard diacritic for nasalization.

==Vietnamese==
In the Vietnamese language, the symbol &quot;Õ&quot; stands for the sound with creaky voice (rising tone with a glottal break followed by a continuation of the rising tone). Vietnamese also has derived letters Ỗ/ỗ and Ỡ/ỡ.

==Võro==
In the Võro language, this letter is the 25th letter of the alphabet, pronounced as in Estonian.

==Skolt Sami==
In the Skolt Sami language, this letter is the 25th letter of the alphabet, pronounced as [].

==Voko==
In the Voko language, the letter &quot;Õ&quot; represents &#x27;ɔ̀ŋ&#x27;.

==Mathematical use==
The symbol, pronounced soft-&quot;O&quot;, is used as a variant of big &quot;O&quot; notation to measure growth rate that ignores logarithmic factors. Thus, formula_1 is shorthand for formula_2.

==Computer encoding==
Due to character encoding confusion, the letters can be seen on many incorrectly coded Hungarian web pages, representing Ő/ő (letter O with double acute accent). This can happen due to said characters sharing a code point in the ISO 8859-1 and 8859-2 character sets, as well as the Windows-1252 and Windows-1250 character sets, and the web site designer forgetting to set the correct code page. Õ is not part of the Hungarian alphabet. The usage of Unicode avoids this type of problems. In LaTeX the option of using &quot;\~o&quot; and &quot;\~O&quot; exists.

<doc id="211022" wikidata="Q17089965" url="?curid=211022" title="National service">
<text>National service is a system of compulsory or voluntary government service, usually military service. Conscription is mandatory national service. The term &quot;national service&quot; comes from the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939.

The length and nature of national service depends on the country in question. In some instances, national service is compulsory, and citizens living abroad can be called back to their country of origin to complete it. In other cases, national service is voluntary.

Many young people spend one or more years in such programmes. Compulsory military service typically requires all citizens to enroll for one or two years, usually at age 18 (later for university-level students). Most conscripting countries conscript only men, but Norway, Sweden, Israel, Eritrea, Morocco and North Korea conscript both men and women. 

Voluntary national service may require only three months of basic military training. The US equivalent is Selective Service. In the United States, voluntary enrollments at the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps are also known as national service.

==Historical arguments==

Around 100 AD, Plutarch quoted an early case for national service made by a Roman general sometime around the 5th century BC:With the politic design of preventing intestine broils by employment abroad, and in the hope that when rich as well as poor, plebeians and patricians, should be mingled again in the same army and in the same camp, and engage in one common service for the public, it would mutually dispose them to reconciliation and friendship.

<text>William Ramsey Clark (December 18, 1927 – April 9, 2021) was an American lawyer, activist, and federal government official. A progressive, New Frontier liberal, he occupied senior positions in the United States Department of Justice under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, serving as United States Attorney General from 1967 to 1969; previously, he was Deputy Attorney General from 1965 to 1967 and Assistant Attorney General from 1961 to 1965.

As attorney general, Clark was known for his vigorous opposition to the death penalty, aggressive support of civil liberties and civil rights, and dedication to enforcing United States antitrust laws. Clark supervised the drafting of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights Act of 1968.

After leaving public office, Clark led many progressive activism campaigns, including opposition to the War on Terror. He offered advice or legal defense to such prominent figures as Charles Taylor, Slobodan Milošević, Saddam Hussein, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, and Lyndon LaRouche. He was the last surviving Cabinet member of the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

==Early life and career==
Clark was born in Dallas, Texas, on December 18, 1927, the son of jurist Tom C. Clark and his wife Mary Jane (née Ramsey). Clark&#x27;s father served as United States Attorney General from 1945 to 1949 under President Harry S. Truman and then became a Supreme Court Justice in August 1949. His maternal grandfather was William Franklin Ramsey, who served on the Supreme Court of Texas, while his paternal grandfather, lawyer William Henry Clark, was president of the Texas Bar Association.

Clark attended Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington, D.C., but dropped out at the age of 17 in order to join the United States Marine Corps, seeing action in Western Europe in the final months of World War II; he served until 1946. Back in the U.S., he earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Texas at Austin in 1949, and obtained a Master of Arts in American history from the University of Chicago and a Juris Doctor from the University of Chicago Law School in 1950 and 1951, respectively. While at the University of Texas, he was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.

He was admitted to the Texas bar in 1950, and was admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1956. From 1951 to 1961, Clark practiced law as an associate and partner at his father&#x27;s Texas law firm, Clark, Reed and Clark.

==Kennedy and Johnson administrations==

In the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, Clark occupied senior positions in the Justice Department; he was Assistant Attorney General, overseeing the department&#x27;s Lands Division from 1961 to 1965, and then served as Deputy Attorney General from 1965 to 1967.

In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated him to be Attorney General of the United States. He was confirmed by the Senate and took the oath of office on March 2. Clark was one of Johnson&#x27;s popular and successful cabinet appointments, being described as &quot;able, independent, liberal and soft-spoken&quot; and a symbol of the New Frontier liberals; he had also built a successful record, especially in his management of the Justice Department&#x27;s Lands Division; he had increased the efficiency of his division and had saved enough money from his budget so that he had asked Congress to reduce the budget by $200,000 annually.

However, there also was speculation that one of the reasons that contributed to Johnson&#x27;s making the appointment was the expectation that Clark&#x27;s father, Associate Justice Tom C. Clark, would resign from the Supreme Court to avoid a conflict of interest. Johnson wanted a vacancy to be created on the Court so he could appoint Thurgood Marshall, the first African American justice. The elder Clark assumed senior status on June 12, 1967, effectively resigning from the Supreme Court and creating the vacancy Johnson apparently desired.

During his years at the Justice Department, Clark played an important role in the history of the civil rights movement. He:
*supervised the federal presence at Ole Miss during the week following the admission of James Meredith;
*surveyed all school districts in the South desegregating under court order (1963);
*supervised federal enforcement of the court order protecting the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches; 
*headed the Presidential task force to Watts following the 1965 riots; and
*supervised the drafting and executive role in passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights Act of 1968.

As attorney general during part of the Vietnam War, Clark oversaw the prosecution of the Boston Five for &quot;conspiracy to aid and abet draft resistance.&quot; Four of the five were convicted, including pediatrician Dr. Benjamin Spock and Yale chaplain William Sloane Coffin Jr., but in later years, Clark expressed his regret at the prosecution&#x27;s victory: &quot;We won the case, that was the worst part.&quot;

Clark served as the attorney general until Johnson&#x27;s term as president ended on January 20, 1969. Because of Richard Nixon&#x27;s attacks on Clark&#x27;s liberal record during the 1968 presidential election campaign and ultimate narrow victory over Hubert H. Humphrey, relations between Johnson and Clark soured and, by inauguration day, they were no longer on speaking terms.

In addition to his government work, during this period Clark was also director of the American Judicature Society (in 1963) and national president of the Federal Bar Association in 1964–65.

==Private career==

Following his term as attorney general, Clark taught courses at the Howard University School of Law (1969–1972) and Brooklyn Law School (1973–1981). He was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement and visited North Vietnam in 1972 as a protest against the bombing of Hanoi. During this time he was associated with the New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, but he resigned in 1973, saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel like working on things I didn&#x27;t believe in, I didn&#x27;t think were important.&quot;

On January 28, 1970, Ramsey Clark testified in the Chicago Seven trial. He was barred by Judge Julius Hoffman from testifying before the jury after Clark had testified outside the presence of the jury. Judge Hoffman upheld the prosecution&#x27;s objections to 14 of Defense Attorney William Kunstler&#x27;s 38 questions to Clark, but Clark did testify that he had told the prosecutor Tom Foran to investigate the charges against the defendants through Justice Department lawyers &quot;as is generally done in civil rights cases&quot;, rather than through a grand jury.

At the 1972 Democratic National Convention, Clark received one delegate vote for the presidential nomination and two delegate votes for the vice-presidential nomination.

In 1974, Clark ran as the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senator from New York; he defeated the party&#x27;s designee Lee Alexander in the primary, but lost in the general election to the incumbent Jacob Javits. In the 1976 election, Clark again sought the Democratic nomination to represent New York in the Senate, but finished a distant third in the primary behind Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Congresswoman Bella Abzug.

On November 5, 1979, at the start of the Iranian hostage crisis, President Jimmy Carter instructed Clark and Senate staffer William Miller to visit Tehran and seek to open negotiations with Iranian authorities for the hostages&#x27; release; while en route, they were refused entry into the country by Ayatollah Khomeini. Defying a travel ban, Clark went to Tehran again in June 1980 to attend a conference on alleged U.S. interference in Iranian affairs, on which occasion he was granted admission. While there he both demanded the release of the hostages and criticized past U.S. support for the deposed Shah. This second unauthorized trip reportedly infuriated President Carter.

== International activism ==
In 1991, Clark&#x27;s Coalition to Stop U.S. Intervention in the Middle East opposed the U.S.-led war and sanctions against Iraq. Clark accused the administration of President George H. W. Bush, its officials Dan Quayle, James Baker, Dick Cheney, William Webster, Colin Powell, Norman Schwarzkopf, and &quot;others to be named&quot; of &quot;crimes against peace, war crimes&quot;, and &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; for its conduct of the Gulf War against Iraq and the ensuing sanctions; in 1996, he added the charges of genocide and the &quot;use of a weapon of mass destruction&quot;. Similarly, after the 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Ramsey charged and &quot;tried&quot; NATO on 19 counts and issued calls for its dissolution.

In September 1998, Clark led a delegation to Sudan to collect evidence in the aftermath of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum the previous month as part of Operation Infinite Reach. Upon returning to the U.S., the delegation held a press conference on September 22, 1998, to refute the U.S. State Department&#x27;s claims that the facility had been producing VX nerve agent. U.S. officials later acknowledged that the evidence cited as the rationale for the Al-Shifa strike was weaker than initially believed.
As a lawyer, Clark was criticized by both opponents and supporters for some of the people he agreed to defend, such as foreign dictators hostile to the United States; Clark stood beside and defended his clients, regardless of their own admitted actions and crimes.

In 2004, Clark joined a panel of about 20 Arab and one other non-Arab lawyers to defend Saddam Hussein in his trial before the Iraqi Special Tribunal. Clark appeared before the Iraqi Special Tribunal in late November 2005 arguing &quot;that it failed to respect basic human rights and was illegal because it was formed as a consequence of the United States&#x27; illegal war of aggression against the people of Iraq.&quot; Clark said that unless the trial was seen as &quot;absolutely fair&quot;, it would &quot;divide rather than reconcile Iraq&quot;. Christopher Hitchens said Clark was admitting Hussein&#x27;s guilt when Clark reportedly stated in a 2005 BBC interview: &quot;He [Saddam] had this huge war going on, and you have to act firmly when you have an assassination attempt&quot;.

Hitchens continued to describe Clark in the following terms:
Sociologist and anti-communist scholar Paul Hollander wrote of Clark: 
Clark was not alone in criticizing the Iraqi Special Tribunal&#x27;s trial of Saddam Hussein, which drew intense criticism from international human rights organizations. Human Rights Watch called Saddam&#x27;s trial a &quot;missed opportunity&quot; and a &quot;deeply flawed trial&quot;, and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found the trial to be unfair and to violate basic international human rights law. Among the irregularities cited by HRW, were that proceedings were marked by frequent outbursts by both judges and defendants, that three defense lawyers were murdered, that the original chief judge was replaced, that important documents were not given to defense lawyers in advance, that paperwork was lost, and that the judges made asides that pre-judged Saddam Hussein. One of the aforementioned outbursts occurred when Clark was ejected from the trial after passing the judge a memorandum stating that the trial was making &quot;a mockery of justice&quot;. The chief judge Raouf Abdul Rahman shouted at Clark, &quot;No, you are the mockery ... get him out. Out!&quot;

On March 18, 2006, Clark attended the funeral of Slobodan Milošević. He commented: &quot;History will prove Milošević was right. Charges are just that: charges. The trial did not have facts.&quot; He compared the trial of Milošević with Saddam&#x27;s, stating &quot;both trials are marred with injustice, both are flawed.&quot; He characterized Milošević and Saddam Hussein as &quot;both commanders who were courageous enough to fight more powerful countries.&quot;
In June 2006, Clark wrote an article criticizing U.S. foreign policy in general, containing a list of 17 U.S. &quot;major aggressions&quot; introduced by &quot;Both branches of our One Party system, Democrat and Republican, favor the use of force to have their way.&quot; He followed this by saying, &quot;The United States government may have been able to outspend the Soviet Union into economic collapse in the Cold War arms race, injuring the entire planet in the process. Now Bush has entered a new arms race and is provoking a Second Cold War.&quot;

On September 1, 2007, in New York City, Clark called for detained Filipino Jose Maria Sison&#x27;s release and pledged assistance by joining the latter&#x27;s legal defense team headed by Jan Fermon. Clark doubted Dutch authorities&#x27; &quot;validity and competency&quot;, since the murder charges originated in the Philippines and had already been dismissed by the country&#x27;s Supreme Court.

In November 2007, Clark visited Nandigram in India where conflict between state government forces and villagers resulted in the death of at least 14 villagers. In a December 2007 interview, he described the War on Terror as a war against Islam.

In April 2009, Clark spoke at a session of the UN&#x27;s anti-racism Durban Review Conference at which he accused Israel of genocide.

In September 2010, an essay on torture by Clark was published in a three-part paperback entitled &quot;The Torturer in the Mirror&quot; (Seven Stories Press).

Clark was a recipient of the 1992 Gandhi Peace Award, and also the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award for his commitment to civil rights, his opposition to war and military spending and his dedication to providing legal representation to the peace movement, particularly, his efforts to free Leonard Peltier. In 1999, he traveled to Belgrade to receive an honorary doctorate from Belgrade University.

In 2008, the United Nations awarded him its Prize in the Field of Human Rights for &quot;his steadfast insistence on respect for human rights and fair judicial process for all&quot;.

==Advocating the impeachment of George W. Bush==

In 2002, Clark founded &quot;VoteToImpeach&quot;, an organization advocating the impeachment of President George W. Bush and several members of his administration. For the duration of Bush&#x27;s terms in office, Clark sought, unsuccessfully, for the House of Representatives to bring articles of impeachment against Bush. He was the founder of the International Action Center, which holds significant overlapping membership with the Workers&#x27; World Party. Clark and the IAC helped found the protest organization A.N.S.W.E.R. (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism).

On March 19, 2003, the New Jersey newspaper and website &quot;The Independent&quot; reported Clark&#x27;s efforts to impeach Bush and others, prior to the start of the Iraq War. The paper commented: &quot;Clark said there is a Web site, www.votetoimpeach.org, dedicated to collecting signatures of U.S. citizens who want President George W. Bush impeached, and that approximately 150,000 have signed to impeach, he said.&quot; &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; magazine stated in an article dated February 27, 2004, &quot;Ramsey Clark&#x27;s VoteToImpeach.org is a serious operation&quot;, and said the group had run full-sized newspaper advertising on both coasts of the U.S. though the &quot;Standard&quot; also went on to describe them as also being an &quot;angry petition stage.&quot;

Clark&#x27;s speech to a counter-inauguration protest on January 20, 2005, at John Marshall Park in Washington, D.C., was broadcast by &quot;Democracy Now&quot; in which Clark stated: &quot;We&#x27;ve had more than 500,000 people sign on &#x27;Vote to Impeach&#x27;.&quot; The &quot;San Francisco Bay Guardian&quot; listed the website as one of three &quot;Impeachment links&quot;, alongside afterdowningstreet.org and impeachpac.org.

The organization, under Clark&#x27;s guidance, drafted its own articles of impeachment against President Bush, Vice President Richard B. Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Attorney General John Ashcroft. The document argues that the four committed, &quot;violations and subversions of the Constitution of the United States of America in an attempt to carry out with impunity crimes against peace and humanity and war crimes and deprivations of the civil rights of the people of the United States and other nations, by assuming powers of an imperial executive unaccountable to law and usurping powers of the Congress, the Judiciary and those reserved to the people of the United States.&quot; Votetoimpeach.org claimed to have collected over one million signatures in favor of impeachment as of January 2009.

==Notable clients==
As a lawyer, Clark also provided legal counsel and advice to prominent figures, including many controversial individuals.

Regarding his role as a defense lawyer in the trial of Saddam Hussein, Clark said: &quot;A fair trial in this case is absolutely imperative for historical truth.&quot; Clark stated that by the time he decided to join Hussein&#x27;s defense team, it was clear that &quot;proceedings before the Iraqi Special Tribunal would corrupt justice both in fact and in appearance and create more hatred and rage in Iraq against the American occupation...affirmative measures must be taken to prevent prejudice from affecting the conduct of the case and the final judgment of the court...For there to be peace, the days of victor&#x27;s justice must end.&quot;

A partial listing of persons who have reportedly received legal counsel and advice from Ramsey Clark includes:

*Lori Berenson, an American convicted of support of MRTA guerrillas in Peru.
*Father Philip Berrigan, a Catholic priest and antiwar activist (one of the Harrisburg Seven). Clark served as defense counsel at trial and won an acquittal.
*Young church worker Jennifer Casolo, charged by Salvadoran authorities in 1989 with aiding the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. Clark traveled to El Salvador to aid in her defense. Casolo was released and deported to the U.S. after 18 days in police detention.
*Radovan Karadžić, former Bosnian Serb politician. In the 1990s, Clark represented Karadžić in a civil suit brought by Croats and Muslims from the former Yugoslavia who sued Karadžić under the Alien Tort Claims Act of 1789 and Torture Victims Protection Act of 1992 for atrocities and human rights abuses committed during the Bosnian War.
* About 100 survivors and relatives of the dead members of the Branch Davidian sect, whose Mount Carmel compound besieged by federal agents in a 51-day Waco siege in 1993, resulting in the death of about 80 members. Clark represented the plaintiffs in a suit alleging wrongful death and excessive force, giving an impassioned closing argument in which he called the siege &quot;the greatest domestic law enforcement tragedy in the history of the United States.&quot; In a trial in 2000, the jury returned a verdict for the government.
* Lyndon LaRouche.
*Nazi concentration camp commandant Karl Linnas.
*Camilo Mejía, a U.S. soldier who deserted his post.
*The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws Advisory Board during the 1970s and early 1980s.
*American Indian Movement prisoner Leonard Peltier.
*Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, a leader in the Rwandan genocide.
*Palestine Liberation Organization leaders in a lawsuit brought by the family of Leon Klinghoffer, who was murdered during hijacking of the &quot;Achille Lauro&quot;.
*Nazi War criminal Jakob &quot;Jack&quot; Reimer, charged for the killings of Jews in Warsaw.
*Liberian dictator Charles Taylor during his 1985 fight against extradition from the United States to Liberia, Taylor would later be convicted of crimes against humanity.
*Civil rights attorney Stephen Yagman, whose disbarment from U.S. federal court was sought based on his harsh criticism of a federal judge, William Duffy Keller, calling him an anti-Semite and saying he had been drunk on the bench. The disbarment never went into effect and later was reversed.
==In popular culture==
In Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s 2020 film &quot;The Trial of the Chicago 7&quot;, Clark was portrayed by Michael Keaton.

==Personal life and death==
Clark married Georgia Welch, a classmate from the University of Texas, on April 16, 1949. They had two children, Ronda Kathleen Clark and Tom Campbell Clark II. His wife died on July 3, 2010, at the age of 81. His son Tom died from cancer on November 23, 2013.

Clark died at age 93 at his home in Greenwich Village in New York City on April 9, 2021.

<text>The Palmer drought index, sometimes called the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), is a regional drought index commonly used for monitoring drought events and studying areal extent and severity of drought episodes. The index uses precipitation and temperature data to study moisture supply and demand using a simple water balance model. It was developed by meteorologist Wayne Palmer, who first published his method in the 1965 paper &quot;Meteorological Drought&quot; for the Office of Climatology of the U.S. Weather Bureau.

The Palmer Drought Index is based on a supply-and-demand model of soil moisture. Supply is comparatively straightforward to calculate, but demand is more complicated as it depends on many factors, not just temperature and the amount of moisture in the soil but also hard-to-calibrate factors including evapotranspiration and recharge rates. Palmer tried to overcome these difficulties by developing an algorithm that approximated them based on the most readily available data, precipitation and temperature.

The index has proven most effective in determining long-term drought, a matter of several months, but it is not as good with conditions over a matter of weeks. It uses a 0 as normal, and drought is shown in terms of negative numbers; for example, negative 2 is moderate drought, negative 3 is severe drought, and negative 4 is extreme drought. Palmer&#x27;s algorithm also is used to describe wet spells, using corresponding positive numbers. Palmer also developed a formula for standardizing drought calculations for each individual location based on the variability of precipitation and temperature at that location. The Palmer index can therefore be applied to any site for which sufficient precipitation and temperature data is available.

Critics have argued that the utility of the Palmer index is weakened by the arbitrary nature of Palmer&#x27;s algorithms, including the technique used for standardization and arbitrary designation of drought severity classes and internal temporal memory. The Palmer index&#x27;s inability to account for snow and frozen ground also is cited as a weakness.

The Palmer index is widely used operationally, with Palmer maps published weekly by the United States Government&#x27;s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It also has been used by climatologists to standardize global long-term drought analysis. Global Palmer data sets have been developed based on instrumental records beginning in the 19th century. In addition, dendrochronology has been used to generate estimated Palmer index values for North America for the past 2000 years, allowing analysis of long term drought trends. It has also been used as a means of explaining the Late Bronze Age collapse.

In the US, regional Palmer maps are featured on the cable channel Weatherscan.

== PDSI classification ==
The PDSI is a standardized index that ranges from -10 to +10, with negative values indicating drought conditions and positive values indicating wet conditions.

<doc id="211045" wikidata="Q1470138" url="?curid=211045" title="Frontal assault">
<text>A frontal assault is a military tactic which involves a direct, full-force attack on the front line of an enemy force, rather than to the flanks or rear of the enemy. It allows for a quick and decisive victory, but at the cost of subjecting the attackers to the maximum defensive power of the enemy; this can make frontal assaults costly even if successful, and often disastrously costly if unsuccessful. It may be used as a last resort when time, terrain, limited command control, or low troop quality do not allow for any battlefield flexibility. The risks of a frontal assault can be mitigated by the use of heavy supporting fire, diversionary attacks, the use of cover (such as smokescreens or the darkness of night), or infiltration tactics.

Frontal assaults were common in ancient warfare, where heavy infantry made up the core of armies such as the Greek phalanx and the Roman legion. These dense formations, many ranks deep, would utilize their weight in numbers to press forward and break enemy lines. In medieval warfare, heavy cavalry such as mounted knights relied on frontal assaults for easy victories against infantry levies. 

These tactics waned as the defensive quality of infantry increased, especially with the introduction of firearms. Both heavy infantry and heavy cavalry were replaced with lighter, more maneuverable troops.

Yet even in Napoleonic warfare, a frontal assault by cavalry against a thin line could be effective when conditions were right, or even by infantry if the enemy was shaken or weakened by preceding attacks. But as firepower increased, as with the introduction of the rifle, successful frontal assaults against a prepared enemy became rare. They continued to be attempted, however, as alternative tactics that could achieve a decisive victory for the attacker were not developed.

During the American Civil War, it took some time for generals on both sides to understand that a frontal assault against an enemy who was well entrenched or otherwise held a strong defensive position was unlikely to succeed and was wasteful of manpower.

During World War I, advances in machine guns and artillery greatly increased defensive firepower, while trench warfare removed almost all options for battlefield maneuver. This resulted in repeated frontal assaults with horrific casualties. Only at the end of the war, with the introduction of tanks, infiltration tactics, and combined arms, were the beginnings of modern maneuver warfare found as a way to avoid the necessity of frontal assaults.

==Battles with notably successful frontal assaults==
*Battle of Bunker Hill – After two failed attempts, the British army succeeds in capturing the heights.
*Battle of Missionary Ridge – Union army storms Missionary Ridge after flank attacks are stalled.
*Battle of Pea Ridge – Union army routs Confederate forces in a frontal assault on the second day.
*Battle of Spotsylvania Court House – Union army captures the &quot;Mule Shoe&quot; salient.
*Brusilov Offensive – Russian army breaks Austro-Hungarian lines during the First World War, though infiltration tactics were used.
*Battle of Vimy Ridge – Operationally, a frontal assault, though new platoon-based tactics enabled tactical maneuver at the lowest levels.

==Battles with notably unsuccessful frontal assaults==
*Battle of Carillon – A classic example of tactical military incompetence.
*Battle of Gettysburg – Pickett&#x27;s Charge aims at the Union center and is repulsed.
*Battle of Fredericksburg – Union army fails to take Marye&#x27;s Heights.
*Battle of Franklin – Repeated Confederate charges are repulsed.
*Battle of Balaklava – The Charge of the Light Brigade.
*Battle of Cold Harbor – Union assaults repulsed by Confederate forces with heavy casualties.
*Battle of Longewala – Failure of Pakistan Army&#x27;s 206 and 51 Brigades with 2000-3000 men and 40 tanks attack on 120 Indian soldiers of the A company of the Punjab Regiment defending the Longewala border post.

<doc id="211054" wikidata="Q4385141" url="?curid=211054" title="USS Albany (CA-123)">
<text>USS &quot;Albany&quot; (CA-123) was a United States Navy heavy cruiser, later converted to the guided missile cruiser CG-10. The converted cruiser was the lead ship of the new &quot;Albany&quot; guided missile cruiser class. She was the fourth ship to carry the name &quot;Albany&quot;.

The ship was laid down on 6 March 1944 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem Steel Company, launched on 30 June 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Elizabeth F. Pinckney, and commissioned on 15 June 1946 at the Boston Navy Yard.

==Service history==
Following outfitting and a shakedown cruise in the vicinity of Casco Bay, Maine, &quot;Albany&quot; began operations along the east coast of the United States punctuated with cruises to the West Indies. During the ensuing months, the cruiser made a number of voyages for the purpose of training naval reservists and NROTC midshipmen. &quot;Albany&quot; continued to perform such duty until 11 September 1948, when she stood out of Chesapeake Bay for her first tour of duty with the American naval forces operating in the Mediterranean Sea, recently made a permanent establishment as the 6th Fleet. That deployment set the tone for the next decade. The cruiser alternated five assignments to the 6th Fleet with operations along the east coast of the United States and in the West Indies and made three cruises to South American ports. During one of the South American voyages, &quot;Albany&quot; carried the official United States representative to the inauguration of the President of Brazil in January 1951.

For two years, stretching at least until the autumn of 1955, &quot;Albany&quot; served as flagship for Commander, Battleship-Cruiser Force, Atlantic.

===Conversion to guided missile cruiser===
On 30 June 1958, &quot;Albany&quot; was placed out of commission at the Boston Naval Shipyard to begin conversion to a guided missile cruiser. On 1 November 1958, she was redesignated CG-10. The warship spent the next four years at Boston undergoing very extensive modifications as part of the conversion; stripped down to her hull to be fitted with a new superstructure. &quot;Albany&quot; was recommissioned at Boston on 3 November 1962 with Captain Ben B. Pickett in command. For almost five years, she alternated deployments to European waters – both to the Mediterranean Sea and to the North Atlantic – with operations along the east coast and in the West Indies. During that time, the cruiser visited many foreign ports and participated in a number of exercises with units of friendly navies. On 1 March 1967, she was decommissioned at the Boston Naval Shipyard once again to undergo extensive modifications. Some 20 months later, on 9 November 1968, &quot;Albany&quot; was placed back in commission at Boston with Captain Allan P. Slaff in command. In 1973, the ship was again decommissioned for overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. It was recommissioned in May 1974 and homeported in Norfolk, VA under the command of Captain John J. Ekelund. Shortly thereafter, it became the flagship of the 2nd Fleet.

Between 1976 and 1980, &quot;Albany&quot; was the flagship of the 6th Fleet, and homeported in Gaeta, Italy.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Albany&quot; was decommissioned on 29 August 1980 and laid up on the Elizabeth River across from the Norfolk Navy Yard. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 June 1985, but she remained at her berth and held for possible donation as a museum ship in her name sake city for a further five years. Though there was serious interest in saving the ship, a feasible museum and financial plan was never realized, and she was sold for scrapping on 12 August 1990.

==Commemoration==
A portion of &quot;Albany&quot;″s bow resides at the Albany County Fairgrounds in Altamont, New York.

The original 14-foot-long (1:48 scale) brass model of the ship built by the United States Navy to help determine where antenna arrays would go on the actual-size ships was restored in 2013 and is on display at the Albany Heritage Area Visitors Center. USS Albany&#x27;s bridge equipments like the ship wheel, clock, window, telephone, dining silver sets, items from crew members, shipbuilder plaque, bell, and more are all on display at USS Albany Heritage Exhibit.

<doc id="211055" wikidata="Q1458238" url="?curid=211055" title="United Reformed Church">
<text>The United Reformed Church (URC) is a Protestant Christian church in the United Kingdom. As of 2024 it had approximately 44,000 members in around 1,250 congregations with 334 stipendiary ministers.

The URC is a trinitarian church whose theological roots are distinctly Reformed and whose historical and organisational roots are in the Presbyterian (Calvinism) and Congregational traditions. Its Basis of Union contains a statement concerning the nature, faith and order of the United Reformed Church which sets out its beliefs in a condensed form.

==Origins and history==
The United Reformed Church resulted from the 1972 union of the Presbyterian Church of England and the Congregational Church in England and Wales. In introducing the United Reformed Church Bill in the House of Commons on 21 June 1972, Alexander Lyon called it &quot;one of the most historic measures in the history of the Christian churches in this country&quot;. About a quarter of English Congregational churches chose not to join the new denomination; in England, there are three main groups of continuing Congregationalists: the Congregational Federation, the Evangelical Fellowship of Congregational Churches and the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches.

The URC subsequently united with the Re-formed Association of Churches of Christ in 1981 and the Congregational Union of Scotland in 2000.

In 2007, a detailed report was submitted to the General Assembly exploring the church&#x27;s position on same-sex relationships. In 2011, the URC allowed the blessing of same-sex unions. On 9 July 2016 the church formally voted by 240 votes to 21 in favour of allowing any local church to offer same-sex marriages, if it chooses to obtain a licence. In 2012, the URC voted to allow the blessing of same-sex civil partnerships.

===Ecumenism===

Formed in an act of ecumenical union, the URC is committed to ecumenism. The denomination is a member of many ecumenical organisations, including Churches Together in England, Cytûn (Churches Together in Wales), the Enfys covenant, Action of Churches Together in Scotland (ACTS) and Churches Together in Britain and Ireland, the World Council of Churches, the Conference of European Churches, the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe, the World Communion of Reformed Churches and the Council for World Mission.

In 1982, the URC voted in favour of a covenant with the Church of England, the Methodist Church and the Moravian Church, which would have meant remodelling its moderators as bishops and incorporating its ministry into the apostolic succession. However, the Church of England rejected the covenant.

===Archives===
The denominational archives of the United Reformed Church are held in the Congregational Library, housed at the Dr Williams&#x27;s Library, in London, as are the archives of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. The papers of the Presbyterian Church of England are held at Westminster College, Cambridge. The papers of associated missionary societies (London Missionary Society, the Council for World Mission (Congregational), and the Foreign Missions Committee (Presbyterian)) are held by the Archives of the School of Oriental and African Studies, London.

Local church records are the responsibility of the church concerned, and will normally be found either in the relevant local record office, or at the church concerned.

==Polity and ministries==
The URC is governed by a combined form of congregationalism and presbyterian polity.

===Congregation===
According to its 2022 Yearbook, the United Reformed Church has approximately 40,000 members in 1,284 congregations with 334 stipendiary ministers, 56 non-stipendiary ministers, 110 non-active or in non-URC posts, 844 retired ministers, 209 of whom are active, 30 church-related community workers, 218 ministers of other churches, 36 Synod recognised local lay leaders and lay pastors, 2 mission partners, 342 accredited lay preachers, 7,286 serving elders and 6,278 non serving elders. The decline of the denomination matches that of other Christian churches in the United Kingdom such as the Church of England and the Methodist Church.

Each congregation (local church) within the URC is governed by a Church Meeting consisting of all its members, which is the ultimate decision-making body in the local church. There is also an elders&#x27; meeting (similar to the presbyterian Kirk Session in the Church of Scotland) which advises the Church Meeting and shares with the minister the spiritual and pastoral oversight of the church. Elders are normally elected to serve for a specific period of time.

Within the present structures, congregations are able to manage themselves and arrange their services as they choose, reflecting their circumstances and preferences. As a result, congregations, even neighbouring ones, may have quite different characters, types of service and eligibility for communion.

Congregations, through the Church Meeting, are responsible for the selection (issue of a &#x27;call&#x27;) of ministers to fill vacancies. They also select elders from within the membership and accept new members.

===Synod===
At a regional level, representatives of the congregations assemble in a synod. There are 11 English synods, roughly corresponding to each region of England, one in Scotland and one in Wales; each is served by a synod moderator. The synod and its committees provide oversight within the framework of presbyterian polity, giving pastoral care and making important decisions about where ministers serve and how churches share ministry. Through the synods, the URC relates to other Christian denominations at a regional level such as Anglican dioceses. Synods make many key decisions about finance, and about church property, which is usually held in trust by a synod trust company. Synods have committees and employ staff to encourage and serve local churches.

===General Assembly===

The URC has a General Assembly (chaired by a Moderator, who can either be an Elder or an ordained Minister of Word and Sacrament or a Church Related Community Worker (CRCW) which gathers representatives of the whole of the URC to meet annually.

Advised by the Assembly Executive, formerly known as the Mission Council, the General Assembly plans the activity of the URC across Great Britain and makes key policy decisions about the direction of the life of the denomination.

It also appoints central staff (i.e. those responsible Britain-wide), receives reports from committees, and deals with substantial reports and mission initiatives. The synods are represented along with the convenors of the Assembly&#x27;s standing committees.

There are 11 standing committees appointed by General Assembly to carry out its policy and to advise the Assembly. Each committee relates to a different area of church life, including communications, mission, ministries and education and learning.

Assembly Executive, formerly known as the Mission Council, the executive body of the General Assembly, meets once a year every February (until 2022 this meeting took place every November).

=== Church Related Community Work (CRCW)===
Church Related Community Work (CRCW) is a distinctive ministry within the URC. CRCW ministers use the principles of community development to respond to issues facing their neighbourhoods, working alongside local individuals and organisations, developing initiatives to transform communities.

Between them, CRCW ministers enable churches to widen their mission by:
* identifying local needs and opportunities;
* confronting injustice;
* organising community action;
* developing and supporting initiatives that improve the lives and wellbeing of local people; and
* theologically reflecting upon that action.

===United Reformed Church Youth===
URC Youth is for young people aged 11–25. Formed in 1974, with the name the Fellowship of United Reformed Youth (FURY), it is led by URC Youth Executive who plan the annual Youth Assembly. The Youth Executive comprises a representative from each Synod, and several other members such as the Moderator and Moderator-Elect.

== &quot;Reform&quot; magazine ==
The United Reformed Church has published &quot;Reform&quot; magazine since 1972, as a forum for &quot;News, comment, inspiration debate&quot;. A digital edition of the magazine, accessed through an app or online, was launched in April 2015. &quot;Reform&quot; was called &quot;a prophetic voice&quot; by the theologian Robert Beckford in 2013.

<doc id="211058" wikidata="Q1538458" url="?curid=211058" title="ALGOL W">
<text>ALGOL W is a programming language. It is based on a proposal for ALGOL X by Niklaus Wirth and Tony Hoare as a successor to ALGOL 60. ALGOL W is a relatively simple upgrade of the original ALGOL 60, adding string, bitstring, complex number and reference to record data types and call-by-result passing of parameters, introducing the codice_1 statement, replacing codice_2 with the codice_3 statement, and generally tightening up the language.

Wirth&#x27;s entry was considered too little of an advance over ALGOL 60, and the more complex entry from Adriaan van Wijngaarden that would later become ALGOL 68 was selected in a highly contentious meeting. Wirth later published his version as &quot;A contribution to the development of ALGOL&quot;. With a number of small additions, this eventually became ALGOL W.

Wirth supervised a high quality implementation for the IBM System/360 at Stanford University that was widely distributed. The implementation was written in PL360, an ALGOL-like assembly language designed by Wirth. The implementation includes influential debugging and profiling abilities.

ALGOL W served as the basis for the Pascal language, and the syntax of ALGOL W will be immediately familiar to anyone with Pascal experience. The key differences are improvements to record handling in Pascal, and, oddly, the loss of ALGOL W&#x27;s ability to define the length of an array at runtime, which is one of Pascal&#x27;s most-complained-about features.

== Syntax and semantics ==
ALGOL W&#x27;s syntax is built on a subset of the EBCDIC character encoding set. In ALGOL 60, reserved words are distinct lexical items, but in ALGOL W they are only sequences of characters, and do not need to be stropped. Reserved words and identifiers are separated by spaces. In these ways ALGOL W&#x27;s syntax resembles that of Pascal and later languages.

The &quot;ALGOL W Language Description&quot; defines ALGOL W in an affix grammar that resembles Backus–Naur form (BNF). This formal grammar was a precursor of the Van Wijngaarden grammar. 

Much of ALGOL W&#x27;s semantics is defined grammatically:
* Identifiers are distinguished by their definition within the current scope. For example, a codice_4 is an identifier that has been defined by a procedure declaration, a codice_5 is an identifier that is being used as a goto label.
* The types of variables and expressions are represented by affixes. For example codice_6 is the syntactic entity for a function that returns a value of type codice_7, if an identifier has been declared as an integer function in the current scope then that is expanded to codice_8.
* Type errors are grammatical errors. For example, codice_9 and codice_10 are valid but distinct syntactic entities that represent expressions, but codice_11 (i.e., integer division performed on a floating-point value) is an invalid syntactic entity.

ALGOL-W has support for records that are separated into disjoint classes, as well as the creation of references that refer to some predefined class or set of classes.

<doc id="211065" wikidata="Q1754837" url="?curid=211065" title="XTree">
<text>XTree is a file manager program originally designed for use under DOS. It was published by Executive Systems, Inc. (ESI) and first released on 1 April 1985, and became highly popular. The program uses a character-mode interface, which has many elements typically associated with a graphical user interface.

The program filled a acquired niche in the market, as DOS shipped with only a command-line file manager, until the generally unsuccessful DOS Shell that was provided with MS-DOS 4.0. Even then, the speed and features of XTreeGold were superior — specifically support for the Zip compression format and ability to undelete files. The program also has the benefit of requiring very little memory, essential at a time when less than 640 kB of memory was available for programs to run.

==History==
XTree 1.0 was officially introduced on April 1, 1985, at the West Coast Computer Faire and sold for $39.95. Work had begun on XTree in December 1984. The primary developer was Jeffery C. Johnson, who was working for a company named Executive Systems, Inc. (ESI). Additional contributions were made by ESI owners Dale Sinor, Tom Smith, and Henry Hernandez, as well as Ken Broomfield, who provided quality assurance. The XTree name was the concept of Johnson&#x27;s wife, Arletta, who had made the suggestion: &quot;&#x27;XTree&#x27;. You know, like &#x27;X-Tree, X-Tree. Read all about it!&#x27;&quot;. Johnson was the originator of the visual directory tree concept first used in an Epson backup product created by ESI. Johnson describes the creation of a visual directory tree as follows: &#x27;Everyone in the room when I first drew it on a whiteboard [...] When I sat down, Tom and Dale both said &quot;it can&#x27;t be done.&quot; Henry, on the other hand, could read me like a book, and seeing the look in my eyes said something like, &quot;... possible, but not on today&#x27;s computers.&quot; That was a Friday afternoon, it was running by Monday morning and by the end of the day verified as being accurate by an office full of skeptics.

The codice_1 command found in later DOS releases displayed directories in a markedly similar fashion. By 1991, XTree had sold over 3 million copies and was released in over a half-dozen languages.

Even in its earliest version XTree contained features like listing all files of a branch, including subdirectories, listing of all files on a disk, or viewing a file&#x27;s contents in text or hexadecimal format (regardless of its file extension), a feature never added to the built-in Windows file manager.

XTree was supplemented by the enhanced XTreePro in 1988, which added features for working with multiple disk drives, speed improvements, and brought the keyboard commands more in line with other common DOS programs. A version of XTreePro with Novell NetWare connectivity debuted in late 1988. XTreeProGold/XTreeGold succeeded Xtree Pro in 1989, adding pull-down menus to enhance the interface, additional file viewers, and the choice of a Norton Commander-style split pane between locations on different disks. The first GUI-enabled XTree product was XTreeMac, also launched in 1989, which brought the XTree interface metaphors to the Macintosh System as a Finder replacement. While the Macintosh System software already had competent file management, XTreeMac made it easier to move and copy files and added undeletion and enhanced file finding tools.

Also in 1989, the company ran a four-month &quot;Software Amnesty for Everyone&quot;, allowing users of unauthorized copies of XTree to register them for a small fee. Five thousand licenses were sold for $20 each.

XTree suffered a terminal decline after the widespread adoption of Microsoft Windows. The built-in Windows file manager had a vaguely similar appearance to XTree, and while it lacked the speed, keyboard shortcuts and power, it did benefit greatly from being included with Windows.

In 1992 XTree for Windows was released. The product dropped many of the features liked in the DOS versions, with undeletion and file editing particularly noticeable by their absence. The program also took considerably longer to load than both DOS Xtree and other Windows file managers, and operations like viewing files were slower. Despite this, features like native support for file compression and a wide range of file viewers made it the most feature complete Windows file manager of that year. It was not a success for the company. In 1993, the XTree Company was sold to Central Point Software, which was in turn acquired by Symantec in 1994, and in 1995 production of XTree products was halted.

==Clones==
The popularity of the program has led many enthusiasts to develop clone versions that work with modern operating systems. Known clones include Xfile, ZTreeWin, UnixTree and Ytree.

The authors and users commonly view these clones as a tribute to the original XTree program, rather than a competitor, especially since XTree is no longer commercially available.

===UnixTree===

UnixTree formerly was the official UNIX Systems version of XTree; it was modeled very closely after XTreeGold.

UnixTree is written by Rob Juergens and is Free software, released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

<doc id="211066" wikidata="Q305002" url="?curid=211066" title="Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York">
<text>Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York (5 June 1341 – 1 August 1402) was the fifth son (fourth surviving) of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. Like many medieval English princes, Edmund gained his nickname from his birthplace: Kings Langley Palace in Hertfordshire. He was the founder of the House of York, but it was through the marriage of his younger son, Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, to Anne de Mortimer, great-granddaughter of Edmund&#x27;s elder brother Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, that the House of York made its claim to the English throne in the Wars of the Roses. The other party in the Wars of the Roses, the incumbent House of Lancaster, was formed from descendants of Edmund&#x27;s elder brother John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, Edward III&#x27;s third son.

==Early years==
On the death of his godfather, the Earl of Surrey, Edmund was granted the earl&#x27;s lands north of the Trent, primarily in Yorkshire. In 1359, he joined his father King Edward III on an unsuccessful military expedition to France and was made a knight of the Garter in 1361. In 1362, at the age of twenty-one, he was created Earl of Cambridge by his father.

==Military career==
Edmund took part in several military expeditions to France in the 1370s. In 1369, he brought a retinue of 400 men-at-arms and 400 archers to serve with John Hastings, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, on campaigns in Brittany and Angoulême. The following year, he first joined Pembroke again on an expedition to relieve the fortress of Belle Perche and then accompanied his eldest brother Edward, the Black Prince, on a campaign that resulted in the siege and sack of Limoges. In 1375, he sailed with the Earl of March to relieve Brest, but after some initial success, a truce was declared.

In the 1370s, English envoys entered into an alliance with Ferdinand I of Portugal, where Portugal promised to attack Castile with the Lancastrian army. As a consequence of the Caroline War in France, John of Gaunt was forced to postpone the invasion of Castile. In 1381, Edmund finally led an abortive expedition to press John&#x27;s claim to Castile, joining with King Ferdinand in attacking Castile as part of the Fernandine Wars. After months of indecisiveness, a peace was again declared between Castile and Portugal, and Edmund had to lead his malcontented troops home.

Edmund was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports on 12 June 1376 and held office until 1381. On 6 August 1385, he was elevated to Duke of York. Edmund acted as Keeper of the Realm in 1394/95 when his nephew, King Richard II of England, campaigned in Ireland and presided over Parliament in 1395. He was also keeper of the realm in 1396 during the king&#x27;s brief visit to France to collect his child-bride Isabella of Valois. The duke was left as Custodian of the Realm in the summer of 1399 when Richard II departed for another extended campaign in Ireland. In late June of that year, the exiled Henry Bolingbroke landed at Bridlington in Yorkshire. Edmund raised an army to resist Bolingbroke, then decided instead to join him, for which he was well rewarded. He thereafter remained loyal to the new Lancastrian regime as Bolingbroke overthrew Richard II to become King Henry IV.

==Later life==
Richard II&#x27;s 1399 will refers to his successor without naming him, while appointing Edmund as one of the overseers. Some believe Richard intended to make Edmund his heir despite the stronger claims of Henry of Bolingbroke and Edmund Mortimer. This was not due to any preference Richard had for Edmund, but rather a desire the king had to set Edmund&#x27;s son, Edward, on the throne. Towards the end of his life, in 1399, he was appointed Warden of the West March for a short period. Otherwise, from 1399 onward he retired from public life.

Although it was thought, at least from the seventeenth century, that Edmund of Langley died in his birthplace, he died at Epworth, Lincolnshire. He was interred at King&#x27;s Langley Priory; however, his tomb was relocated to the nearby All Saints&#x27; Church, Kings Langley in 1575 after the priory had been dissolved. When the tomb was moved again during church restoration work in 1877, three bodies, one male and two female, were found inside. His dukedom passed to his eldest son, Edward. He was the last of his siblings to die, and lived the longest out of all of them.

==Marriage==
Langley&#x27;s first wife, Isabella, was a daughter of King Peter of Castile and María de Padilla. She was also the younger sister of the Infanta Constance of Castile, the second wife of Langley&#x27;s brother John of Gaunt. Langley and Isabella were both descendants of Henry II of England.

They had two sons and a daughter:

* Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York (c. 1373 – 25 October 1415), killed in action at the Battle of Agincourt.
* Constance of York, Countess of Gloucester (c. 1375 – 28 November 1416), great-grandmother of Queen Anne Neville.
* Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge (c. 20 July 1385 – 5 August 1415), was executed for treason by Henry V. Ancestor of kings Edward IV, Edward V and Richard III of the House of York, and all succeeding monarchs of England beginning with King Henry VIII, whose mother Elizabeth of York was Richard&#x27;s great-granddaughter.

After Isabella&#x27;s death in 1392, Langley married his second cousin once removed, Joan Holland, whose great-grandfather Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, was the half-brother of Langley&#x27;s grandfather Edward II; she and Langley were thus both descended from King Edward I. The young Joan was the granddaughter of his late sister-in-law Joan of Kent. The marriage produced no children.

==Shakespeare&#x27;s Duke of York==

Edmund, the 1st Duke of York, is a major character in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot;. In the play, Edmund resigns his position as an adviser to his nephew Richard II, but is reluctant to betray the king. He eventually agrees to side with Henry Bolingbroke to help him regain the lands Richard confiscated after the death of Bolingbroke&#x27;s father, John of Gaunt. After Bolingbroke deposes Richard and is crowned Henry IV, Edmund discovers a plot by his son Aumerle (Edward of Norwich) to assassinate the new king. Edmund exposes the plot, but his wife Isabella convinces Henry to pardon her son. In reality, Edmund&#x27;s wife Isabella (of Castile) had died in 1392, eight years before the plot against Bolingbroke (Henry IV).

<text>Edward, 2nd Duke of York, ( – 25 October 1415), known as the Earl of Rutland between 1390 and 1397 and again between 1399 and 1402 and as the Duke of Aumale between 1397 and 1399, was an English nobleman, military commander and magnate. He was the eldest son of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, and a grandson of King Edward III of England. He held significant appointments during the reigns of Richard II, Henry IV, and Henry V, and is also known for his translation of the hunting treatise &quot;The Master of Game&quot;. He was killed in 1415 at the Battle of Agincourt, whilst commanding the right wing of the English army.

==Family==
Edward of Norwich was born , likely at Langley, now Kings Langley in Hertfordshire. He was the eldest son of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York (a younger son of King Edward III of England), and his first wife, Isabella of Castile (a daughter of King Peter of Castile). He had a sister Constance and a younger brother Richard, 3rd Earl of Cambridge.

According to G. E. Cokayne, a French chronicle offers the only support for the modern assertion that Edward was styled &#x27;of Norwich&#x27;, and both Cokayne and Horrox suggest that the phrase &#x27;de Norwik&#x27; found therein is a corruption or misreading of &#x27;Deverwik&#x27;, the usual French rendering for the phrase &#x27;of York&#x27; at the time.

==Reign of Richard II==
Edward was knighted at the coronation of his cousin, King Richard II, on 16 July 1377, and in May 1387 was admitted to the Order of the Garter. He was close to the King throughout his life, and benefited even in his youth from numerous royal grants and appointments. On 25 February 1390, the King created him Earl of Rutland, and on 22 March 1391 made him admiral of the northern fleet; he was made sole admiral the following November. In 1392, he became a member of King Richard&#x27;s council, and was with the King during a campaign in Ireland in 1394–5. Prior to that, although no patent has been found, he was created Earl of Cork. He used the styles of Rutland and Cork throughout the remainder of his life.

In the late 1390s, Edward was sent on embassies to France and to the Count Palatine and was appointed to numerous offices, including Constable of Dover Castle, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Keeper of the Channel Islands, Constable of the Tower, Warden of the New Forest, Keeper of Carisbrooke Castle and Lord of the Isle of Wight.

On 11 July 1397, Richard II arrested his uncle Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester. Edward was granted Gloucester&#x27;s office of Constable of England on 12 July and was one of an eight-member commission that on 5 August determined to accuse Gloucester, Thomas Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, and Richard FitzAlan, Earl of Arundel of high treason. Edward was later accused of having sent his servants to assist in Gloucester&#x27;s subsequent murder at Calais, an allegation he denied. However, on 28 September 1397, he received a large grant of Gloucester, Warwick and Arundel&#x27;s forfeited lands. On 29 September, he was created Duke of Aumale, a title that had earlier been granted to Gloucester on 3 September 1385.

On 16 September 1398 Edward presided as constable over the aborted judicial combat between Henry Bolingbroke, the future Henry IV and Thomas de Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, which ended with Bolingbroke and Norfolk being exiled by King Richard.

Additional royal grants followed during the final years of King Richard&#x27;s reign. On 10 February 1398 Edward was appointed Warden of the West March. On 11 August 1398 he was granted custody of the lands of Roger Mortimer, Earl of March, during Mortimer&#x27;s son&#x27;s minority, and on 20 March 1399 lands which had lately belonged to John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and which were part of the inheritance of his son, Henry Bolingbroke, the future King Henry IV.

In May 1399, Edward accompanied King Richard to Ireland, and in the King&#x27;s absence, Henry Bolingbroke (the future King Henry IV) landed towards the end of June near Ravenspur, Yorkshire, with a small band of exiles. During the following three weeks, Bolingbroke&#x27;s forces were augmented by loyal Lancastrian supporters and were soon joined by the most powerful of the northern magnates, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland and Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland. King Richard&#x27;s fatal decision to divide his army while still in Ireland has been attributed to advice from Edward. The King sent some of his troops ahead to North Wales under the command of the John Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, and about 19 July arrived at Milford Haven in South Wales with the rest of his forces. News of the strength of Bolingbroke&#x27;s army then caused the King to desert the troops with him and travel to North Wales in an attempt to join Salisbury. However Salisbury&#x27;s troops, having heard rumours of the King&#x27;s death, had dispersed, and the army left behind by the King did so as well. Although he could have made his escape by sea, the King ensnared himself in negotiations with Bolingbroke. Meanwhile, Edward&#x27;s father Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, who had been left in charge of the kingdom during King Richard&#x27;s absence, and had raised an army on hearing of Bolingbroke&#x27;s landing in Yorkshire, capitulated to Bolingbroke at Berkeley on 27 July. Edward speedily deserted to Bolingbroke as well and was reportedly wearing Bolingbroke&#x27;s livery when he was among those sent by Bolingbroke to the King at Flint Castle.

==Reign of Henry IV==
In response to public animosity towards King Richard&#x27;s closest associates, Henry IV deprived Edward of his office of Constable of the Tower on 31 August 1399, shortly after his accession. On 20 October 1399, he was imprisoned at Windsor Castle, and on 3 November deprived of the dukedom of Aumale, but not his other titles. Edward&#x27;s period of disfavour was not long-lasting, however. The King confirmed him in his offices in connection with the Channel Islands and the Isle of Wight, and by 4 December 1399 had made him a member of his council.

On 18 October 1399, during the first parliament of the new Henry IV, Walter FitzWalter, 4th Baron FitzWalter accused Edward, his stepfather, of the murder of Gloucester and challenged him to single combat. This was stopped by the king, but it was not until 1401 that FitzWalter and Edward of Norwich formally reconciled.

Edward is alleged by a French chronicler to have betrayed to the King a conspiracy at the end of 1399 by a group of Richard II&#x27;s former favourites who planned to murder Henry IV and his sons at a jousting tournament at Windsor Castle on 6 January 1400. But according to James Tait, contemporary English sources that describe the conspiracy make no mention of Edward, and his role in it is open to question.

In October 1400, the King made Edward Keeper of North Wales, and on 5 July 1401, his lieutenant in Aquitaine. On 1 August 1402, Edward&#x27;s father died, and he succeeded to the Duchy of York, at which time his earldom of Rutland became extinct by the terms of its charter, although he continued to sign himself Earl of Rutland. By May 1403, he was back in England. He was employed by the King in a campaign in Wales in the fall of that year, and on 12 November, he was appointed Lieutenant for South Wales for three years. Both this and his appointment in Aquitaine proved very costly, and by June 1404, he had sold or pledged his plate and was contemplating mortgaging his lands to pay his troops in Wales.

In February 1405, the Welsh rebel leader Owain Glyndŵr, Glyndŵr&#x27;s son-in-law Sir Edmund Mortimer and Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, entered into a tripartite indenture that proposed a threefold division of the kingdom. This agreement was apparently connected to a plot to free Mortimer&#x27;s nephew Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, from King Henry&#x27;s custody and carry him into Wales. On 13 February 1405, the young Edmund Mortimer and his brother Roger were abducted from Windsor Castle, but quickly recaptured near Cheltenham. Edward&#x27;s sister Constance was held responsible and accused her brother of involvement in the failed abduction. He at first denied the charge, but later admitted to knowledge of the conspiracy. He was arrested and imprisoned for 17 weeks at Pevensey Castle, after which he petitioned for release, and by October was gradually being returned to favour. His lands were restored to him on 8 December 1405, and in November 1406, he was again made Constable of the Tower and continued to serve in a military capacity in Wales.

In the conflict over foreign policy between Henry IV and his heir, the Prince of Wales (the future King Henry V), that developed in the final years of Henry IV&#x27;s reign, Edward apparently sided with the King. In 1412, he was again in France, this time in the company of the King&#x27;s second son Thomas, to assist the Armagnac party against the Burgundians.

==Reign of Henry V==

Henry IV died on 20 March 1413. Edward may have returned to England for a brief time after the King&#x27;s death, but by June 1413 he was preparing to campaign in Aquitaine. In August he was in Paris, negotiating for a marriage between the new King, Henry V, and Catherine of Valois, daughter of King Charles VI of France, but was back in England in October and active in diplomatic negotiations in the final months prior to Henry V&#x27;s invasion of France in 1415.

A few days before the invasion of France, King Henry uncovered the Southampton Plot and the participation in it of Edward&#x27;s younger brother, Richard of Conisburgh, Earl of Cambridge, for which the younger brother was beheaded on 5 August 1415. Edward himself was not implicated in the conspiracy, and he departed with the army for France. He was present at the Siege of Harfleur, where he made his will on 17 August 1415, then he commanded the van on the army&#x27;s march through northern France. He commanded the right wing at the Battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415, during which he became the highest-ranking English casualty. According to some, he rushed forward to save King Henry V who had been assisting the King&#x27;s younger brother, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and had been assailed and wounded by the Duke of Alençon. York&#x27;s intervention saved the King&#x27;s life but cost Edward his own. His death has been variously attributed to a head wound and to being &#x27;smouldered to death&#x27; by &#x27;much heat and pressing&#x27;. Edward was buried in the Church of St Mary and All Saints, Fotheringhay, where he had earlier established a college for a master and twelve chaplains. The monument now in the church was erected during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.

As Edward did not have any sons, his four-year-old nephew Richard, son of his brother Richard, inherited the titles of Duke of York and Earl of Rutland. As head of the House of York Richard would go on to challenge the Lancastrian claims to the English crown and thus start the Wars of the Roses.

==Marriages==
He married twice, but left no children:

*Firstly in 1381 to Beatrice of Portugal, the daughter of King Ferdinand I of Portugal. At the age of eight, Edward had been taken to Lisbon by his father and betrothed to Beatrice on 29 August 1381 as part of an alliance of England and Portugal against Castile, but after a rapprochement between Portugal and Castile, the marriage was annulled by papal dispensation, and Beatrice married King John I of Castile instead. Later, King Richard II suggested several possible brides for Edward, including Joan, sister of the king&#x27;s wife, Isabella of Valois. 

*Secondly at some time before 7 October 1398 Edward married Philippa de Mohun, third daughter of Sir John V de Mohun, KG, feudal baron of Dunster in Somerset, by his wife Joan Burghersh, daughter of Bartholomew de Burghersh, 3rd Baron Burghersh, whose mother was Maud de Mortimer. Philippa brought little to her husband as her mother Joan Burghersh had sold Dunster Castle and the Mohun estates in 1376. Moreover, Philippa had produced no issue by her two previous husbands, Walter Fitzwalter, 3rd Baron Fitzwalter, and Sir John Golafre. The marriage was without issue. Philippa died on 17 July 1431 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

==&quot;The Master of Game&quot;==
York was Henry IV&#x27;s Master of the Hart Hounds. Between 1406 and 1413 he translated and dedicated to the Prince of Wales the &quot;Livre de Chasse&quot; of Gaston III, Count of Foix, one of the most famous of the hunting treatises of the Middle Ages, to which he added five chapters of his own, the English version being known as &quot;The Master of Game&quot;.

===Arms===
As a grandson of the sovereign in the male line Edward of Norwich bore the arms of the kingdom, differenced by a &quot;label 3-point, per pale Castile and Leon&quot;. In 1402 he inherited his father&#x27;s arms, which were those of the kingdom differentiated by a &quot;label argent of three points, each bearing three torteaux gules&quot;.
==Shakespeare and Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York==
As the Duke of Aumerle, Edward of Langley is a major character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot;. His death at Agincourt (as Duke of York) is portrayed in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;. There is no mention in either play, however, that the Duke of Aumerle portrayed in &quot;Richard II&quot; and the Duke of York portrayed in &quot;Henry V&quot; are, in fact, the same historical individual.

<text>Richard of Conisbrough, 3rd Earl of Cambridge (20 July 1385 – 5 August 1415) was the second son of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, and Isabella of Castile, Duchess of York. He was beheaded for his part in the Southampton Plot, a conspiracy against King Henry V. He was the father of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and the grandfather of King Edward IV and King Richard III.

==Early life==
Richard of York was born about 20 July 1385 at Conisbrough Castle, Yorkshire, the second son of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, and his first wife, Isabella of Castile. On his father&#x27;s side, he was the grandson of King Edward III and Philippa of Hainault, and on his mother&#x27;s side, the grandson of Peter the Cruel, King of Castile and León, and his favourite mistress, María de Padilla (died 1361). There is no record of his birth or baptism, and some put his birth in about 1375. His godfather was King Richard II., a fact that argues for the later date. Richard II was at York on 20 July 1385, close enough to serve as godfather to the future Earl of Cambridge, while in 1375 the future king was only eight years old; it was unlikely he would have been a godfather at that age, and with his father still alive.

Richard was twelve years younger than his brother, Edward. Strangely, Richard received no lands from his father and was mentioned neither in his father&#x27;s will nor his brother&#x27;s will. This circumstance has been taken by G.L. Harriss as an indication that Richard&#x27;s father and brother did not recognize him as a full blood relative, and that he may have been the child of an illicit liaison between his mother and the king&#x27;s half-brother John Holland. This theory gained new life following the DNA studies of the remains of Richard III in 2014.

Although Edmund of Langley made no provision for Richard in his will of 25 November 1400, his mother Isabella named King Richard II as her heir before her death on 23 December 1392 and requested him to grant her younger son an annuity of 500 marks. The king complied. On 3 February 1393, he provided his godson with an annuity of £100 from the revenues in Yorkshire that Isabella had formerly received, and on 16 March 1393, he provided him with a further annuity of 350 marks (£233 6s 8d) from the Exchequer. According to T. B. Pugh, further largess from the king might have been expected when Richard came of age; however, Richard II was deposed in 1399. According to G. L. Harriss, Richard of York &quot;received no favours from the new King, Henry IV&quot;. After Henry IV&#x27;s accession, Richard&#x27;s annuities, his sole source of income, were either paid irregularly, or not paid at all.

From April 1403 to October 1404, Richard commanded a small force defending Herefordshire against the Welsh rebel leader Owain Glyndŵr, but otherwise performed no notable military service. However, it was during this period, according to T. B. Pugh, that Richard established the relationships with the Mortimer and Cherleton families that brought about his marriage to Anne de Mortimer. Richard&#x27;s only other significant appointment during this period came in August 1406 when, together with the Bishop of Bath, Lord FitzHugh, and Lord Scrope, he was chosen to escort King Henry&#x27;s daughter Philippa to Denmark for her marriage to King Eric. Richard was knighted in July of that year, perhaps in anticipation of this embassy. Pugh notes that during this three-month embassy to Denmark, Richard would have become well acquainted with Lord Scrope, who married Richard&#x27;s stepmother Joan Holland in September 1411, and with whom Richard later became involved in the Southampton Plot of 1415 that cost them both their lives.

==Southampton Plot==
In the Parliament of 1414, Richard was created Earl of Cambridge, a title formerly held by his elder brother, Edward, 2nd Duke of York, who had earlier ceased to be Earl of Cambridge either by resignation or deprivation of the title.

Richard&#x27;s creation as Earl of Cambridge in 1414, however, brought with it no accompanying grant of lands, and according to Harriss, Cambridge was &quot;the poorest of the earls&quot; who were to set out on Henry V&#x27;s invasion of France. As a result, he lacked the resources to equip himself properly for the expedition. Perhaps partly for this reason, Richard conspired with Lord Scrope and Sir Thomas Grey to depose Henry V of England and place his late wife Anne&#x27;s brother Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, on the throne. On 31 July, Mortimer revealed the plot to the king. Later, he served on the commission that condemned Richard to death. Although Richard pleaded with the king for clemency, he was beheaded on 5 August 1415 and buried in the chapel of God&#x27;s House at Southampton (now St. Julien&#x27;s Church, Southampton). The fleet set sail for France a few days later, on 11 August 1415.

The Southampton Plot is dramatised in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;, and in the anonymous play, &quot;The History of Sir John Oldcastle&quot;.

==Legacy==

Although Cambridge&#x27;s title was forfeited, he was not attainted, and his four-year-old son Richard was his heir. Within three months, Cambridge&#x27;s elder brother, Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York, was slain at Agincourt, and Cambridge&#x27;s four-year-old son eventually inherited his uncle&#x27;s titles and estates as well as his father&#x27;s.

In the parliament of 1461, King Edward IV had the sentence that had been passed on his grandfather, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, annulled as &quot;irregular and unlawful&quot;.

==Marriages and issue==
Early in 1408 Richard married Anne de Mortimer, the eldest of the four children of Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, and Eleanor Holland. Anne was a niece of Richard&#x27;s stepmother Joan Holland, and the granddaughter of his first cousin, Philippa of Clarence. Thus, Richard and Anne were first cousins twice removed, yet they were close in age; Richard was only three years older than she.

The marriage took place secretly, without parental consent, and was validated on 23 May 1408 by papal dispensation. It brought Richard no financial benefit, since Anne&#x27;s only income was an annuity of £50 granted for her maintenance by Henry IV in 1406.

By his first wife, Richard had two sons and a daughter:

*Isabel of York (1409 – 2 October 1484), who in 1412, at three years of age, was betrothed to Sir Thomas Grey, son and heir of Sir Thomas Grey of Heaton in Norham, Northumberland, and his wife, Alice Neville, the daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, by whom she had one son. Before 25 April 1426, Isabel married secondly Henry Bourchier, 1st Earl of Essex, by whom she had seven sons and one daughter. This marriage was later validated by papal dispensation.
*Henry of York.
*Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York (22 September 1411 – 30 December 1460), who married Cecily Neville, the youngest daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, by whom he had twelve children: Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter; Henry; King Edward IV; Edmund, Earl of Rutland; Elizabeth of York, Duchess of Suffolk; Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy; William; John; George, Duke of Clarence; Thomas; King Richard III; and Ursula.

Anne de Mortimer died on 22 September 1411 soon after the birth of her son Richard. She was buried at Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, once the site of Kings Langley Palace, perhaps in the conventual church which houses the tombs of her husband&#x27;s father Edmund and his first wife Isabella of Castile.

After the death of Anne de Mortimer, Richard married Maud Clifford, the divorced wife of John Neville, 6th Baron Latimer, and daughter of Thomas de Clifford, 6th Baron de Clifford, by Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas de Ros, 4th Baron de Ros, of Helmsley.

After Richard’s death in 1415, his second wife, Maud Clifford, is said to have lived in &quot;great state&quot; at Conisbrough Castle and elsewhere. She died on 26 August 1446 and was buried at Roche Abbey, Yorkshire. She left a will dated 15 August 1446 in which no mention is made of her stepchildren.

==Arms==

Richard bore his father&#x27;s arms (those of the kingdom, differenced by a label argent of three points, each bearing three torteaux gules), differenced by a bordure Leon.

<text>USS &quot;Quincy&quot; (CL/CA-39) was a United States Navy , sunk at the Battle of Savo Island in 1942.

==Construction==
&quot;Quincy&quot;, the second ship to carry the name, was laid down by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, on 15 November 1933, launched on 19 June 1935, sponsored by Mrs. Catherine Adams-Morgan, wife of Henry S. Morgan, and commissioned at Boston, on 9 June 1936, Captain William Faulkner Amsden in command.

The &quot;New Orleans&quot;-class cruisers were the last US cruisers built to the specifications and standards of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Such ships, with a limit of 10,000 tons standard displacement and 8-inch caliber main guns, may be referred to as &quot;treaty cruisers.&quot; Originally classified a light cruiser when she was authorized, because of her thin armor, she was reclassified a heavy cruiser, because of her 8-inch guns. The term &quot;heavy cruiser&quot; was not defined until the London Naval Treaty in 1930. This ship and were a slightly improved version of the &quot;New Orleans&quot;-class design.

== Inter-war period ==
Soon after being assigned to Cruiser Division 8 (CruDiv8), Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Quincy&quot; was ordered to Mediterranean waters on 20 July 1936, to protect American interests in Spain during the height of the Spanish Civil War. &quot;Quincy&quot; passed through the Straits of Gibraltar on 26 July and arrived at Málaga, Spain on 27 July to assume her duties. While in Spanish waters, she operated with an international rescue fleet that included , , and . &quot;Quincy&quot; evacuated 490 refugees to Marseille and Villefranche, France, before being relieved by on 27 September.

&quot;Quincy&quot; returned to the Boston Navy Yard on 5 October for refit preparatory to final acceptance trials which were held from 15–18 March 1937. She got underway for the Pacific on 12 April to join CruDiv 7, transited the Panama Canal from 23–27 April and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 10 May.

&quot;Quincy&quot; sortied with Cruiser Divisions, Pacific Fleet on 20 May on a tactical exercise which was the first of many such maneuvers that she participated in during 1937–1938. From 15 March to 28 April, she engaged in important battle practice off Hawaii with the Pacific Fleet in Fleet Problem XIX. After an overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard, &quot;Quincy&quot; resumed tactical operations with her division off San Clemente, California, until her redeployment to the Atlantic on 4 January 1939.

&quot;Quincy&quot; transited the Panama Canal on 13 January bound for Guantanamo Bay where she engaged in gunnery practice and amphibious exercises. She also took part in Fleet Problem XX with the Atlantic Fleet from 13–26 February. &quot;Quincy&quot; later made a South American goodwill tour from 10 April to 12 June, and upon returning to Norfolk, embarked reservists for three training cruises from 9 July to 24 August. She spent the remainder of 1939 on patrol in the North Atlantic due to the outbreak of World War II.

After overhaul at Norfolk until 4 May 1940, &quot;Quincy&quot; again visited Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, returning to Norfolk on 22 September. She completed three more reserve training cruises from 1 October to 20 December.

&quot;Quincy&quot; was occupied in Atlantic Fleet maneuvers and landing force exercises off Culebra Island, Puerto Rico from 3 February to 1 April 1941. With the growth of hostilities in Europe, she was ordered to Task Force 2 (TF 2) and operated with in the mid-Atlantic, preserving US neutrality from 26 April to 6 June. Later, she operated with and TF 28 until sailing for home on 14 July.

== World War II ==
On 28 July, &quot;Quincy&quot; sailed with TF 16 for Iceland on neutrality duty which included a patrol in the Denmark Straits from 21–24 September. She returned to Newfoundland with a convoy on 31 October. &quot;Quincy&quot; then proceeded to Cape Town, South Africa, via Trinidad, where she met a convoy which she escorted back to Trinidad on 29 December.

&quot;Quincy&quot; returned on 25 January 1942 to Icelandic waters on convoy duty with TF 15 and made a patrol in the Denmark Straits from 8–11 March. She departed on 14 March for the United States and an overhaul at the New York Navy Yard that lasted until the end of May.

&quot;Quincy&quot; sailed for San Diego on 5 June via the Panama Canal and arrived on 19 June. She was then assigned to TF 18 as the flagship of Rear Admiral Norman R. Scott, Commander, Cruisers.

&quot;Quincy&quot; got underway for the South Pacific in July with other vessels assembling for the invasion of Guadalcanal.

Prior to the Marine assault on Guadalcanal on 7 August, &quot;Quincy&quot; destroyed several Japanese installations and an oil depot during her bombardment of Lunga Point. She later provided close fire support for the Marines during the landing.

=== Loss at the Battle of Savo Island ===
While on patrol in the channel between Florida Island and Savo Island, in the early hours of 9 August, &quot;Quincy&quot; was attacked by a large Japanese naval force during the Battle of Savo Island.

&quot;Quincy&quot;, along with sister ships and , had seen aircraft flares dropped over other ships in the task force, and had just sounded general quarters and was coming alert when the searchlights from the Japanese column came on. &quot;Quincy&quot;″s captain, Samuel N. Moore, gave the order to commence firing, but the gun crews were not ready. Within a few minutes, &quot;Quincy&quot; was caught in a crossfire between &quot;Aoba&quot;, &quot;Furutaka&quot;, and &quot;Tenryū&quot;, and was hit heavily and set afire. &quot;Quincy&quot;″s captain ordered his cruiser to charge towards the eastern Japanese column, but as she turned to do so &quot;Quincy&quot; was hit by two torpedoes from &quot;Tenryū&quot;, causing severe damage. &quot;Quincy&quot; managed to fire a few main gun salvos, one of which hit &quot;Chōkai&quot;&#x27;s chart room 6 meters (20 ft) from Admiral Mikawa and killed or wounded 36 men, although Mikawa was not injured. At 02:10, incoming shells killed or wounded almost all of &quot;Quincy&quot;″s bridge crew, including the captain. At 02:16, the cruiser was hit by a torpedo from &quot;Aoba&quot;, and the ship&#x27;s remaining guns were silenced. &quot;Quincy&quot;″s assistant gunnery officer, sent to the bridge to ask for instructions, reported on what he found:

&quot;When I reached the bridge level, I found it a shambles of dead bodies with only three or four people still standing. In the Pilot House itself the only person standing was the signalman at the wheel who was vainly endeavoring to check the ship&#x27;s swing to starboard to bring her to port. On questioning him I found out that the Captain, who at that time was laying near the wheel, had instructed him to beach the ship and he was trying to head for Savo Island, distant some four miles (6 km) on the port quarter. I stepped to the port side of the Pilot House, and looked out to find the island and noted that the ship was heeling rapidly to port, sinking by the bow. At that instant the Captain straightened up and fell back, apparently dead, without having uttered any sound other than a moan.&quot;

&quot;Quincy&quot; sustained many direct hits which left 370 men dead and 167 wounded. She sank, bow first, at 02:38, being the first ship sunk in the area which was later known as Ironbottom Sound.

===Rediscovery===
&quot;Quincy&quot;″s wreck was discovered and explored by Robert Ballard and his crew in July and August 1992. &quot;Quincy&quot; sits upright in roughly of water. Her bow is missing forward of her number 1 turret, both forward turrets are trained to starboard, with turret 1 featuring a jammed gun, and one of turret 2&#x27;s guns burst. Of the superstructure, the bridge is heavily damaged but intact, both funnels are missing, and the float plane hangar completely collapsed. &quot;Quincy&quot;″s stern is bent upwards aft of the number 3 turret, and heavily damaged by implosions.
