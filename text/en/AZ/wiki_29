<text>Australia joined a U.S.-led coalition in the Iraq War. Declassified documents reveal that the decision to go to war was taken primarily with a view to enhancing its alliance with the United States.

The Howard government supported the disarmament of Iraq during the Iraq disarmament crisis. Australia later provided one of the four most substantial combat force contingents during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, under the operational codename Operation Falconer. Part of its contingent were among the first forces to enter Iraq after the official &quot;execute&quot; order. The initial Australian force consisted of three Royal Australian Navy ships, a 500-strong special forces task group, two AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, two B707 Air-to-Air refuelling aircraft, C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and No. 75 Squadron RAAF (which included 14 F/A-18 Hornet fighters). Combat forces committed to Operation Falconer for the 2003 Invasion were withdrawn during 2003. Under the name Operation Catalyst, Australian combat troops were redeployed to Iraq in 2005, however, and assumed responsibility for supporting Iraqi security forces in one of Iraq&#x27;s southern provinces. These troops began withdrawing from Iraq on 1 June 2008 and were completely withdrawn by 28 July 2009.

==Forces committed==

==Operations by Australian Forces==
Planning for the deployment of ADF units to the Middle East began in mid-2002 when Australian officers were attached to United States planning teams. This was before the Government&#x27;s announcement that Australia would join the United States and British buildup, but was conducted as contingency planning which did not imply a commitment to war.

In keeping with its relatively small size, the Australian force made an important though limited contribution to Coalition operations during the invasion of Iraq. The Australian contribution was also geographically dispersed, with the Australian forces forming part of larger US and British units rather than a concentrated Australian unit. No Australian personnel were killed or taken prisoner during the war.

Brigadier Maurie McNarn on 21 March 2003, was the first Coalition commander to hold an official press conference with the international media in Qatar. Australian contributions at the time were widely quoted owing to the lack of official operational news from other participants.

===Maritime operations===

Before the outbreak of war the Australian naval force in the Persian Gulf continued to enforce the sanctions against Iraq. These operations were conducted by boarding parties from the RAN warships and the AP-3 Orion patrol aircraft.

Upon the outbreak of war the RAN&#x27;s focus shifted to supporting the coalition land forces and clearing the approaches to Iraqi ports. HMAS &quot;Anzac&quot; provided gunfire support to Royal Marines during fighting on the Al-Faw Peninsula and the Clearance Diving Team took part in clearing the approaches to Umm Qasr. Boarding operations continued during the war, and on 20 March boarding parties from HMAS &quot;Kanimbla&quot; seized an Iraqi ship carrying 86 naval mines. Army LCM-8 Landing Craft were used as forward deployment and support platforms for the Navy boarding parties and were the first regular Maritime assets to the port of Umm Qasr, moving as far north as Basara on the inland waterways collecting intelligence for allied forces. LCM-8 Assets were utilised by British and American forces for various cargo transportation duties during the course of the war.

===Special forces operations===
The primary role of the Special Forces Task Group was to secure an area of western Iraq from which it was feared that SCUD missiles could be launched. The SAS successfully entered Iraq by vehicle and United States helicopters and secured their area of responsibility after a week of fighting. Following this the SAS patrolled the highways in the area in order to block the escape of members of the Iraqi government and to prevent enemy foreign fighters from entering the country.

On 11 April the SAS Squadron was concentrated to capture the Al Asad Airbase. While this base proved to be almost undefended, the Australian troops captured over 50 MiG jets and more than 7.9 million kilograms of explosives. After securing the air base the SAS were reinforced by 4 RAR and the IRR elements. The Special Forces Task Group remained at Al Asad until the end of the war, when most of the SAS Squadron and IRR Troop returned home and the 4 RAR platoon (reinforced by elements of the SAS) was deployed to Baghdad to protect Australian diplomats.

===Air operations===
No. 75 Squadron&#x27;s initial role was to escort high-value Coalition aircraft such as tankers and AWACS aircraft. As it became clear that the Iraqi Air Force posed no threat, the role of No. 75 Squadron shifted to providing close air support to Coalition ground forces and air interdiction against Iraqi forces. These missions were initially flown in support of the US Army but the Squadron later switched to supporting the US Marines. As organized Baathist resistance crumbled, the F/A-18s were increasingly tasked to provide &#x27;shows of force&#x27; to encourage Iraqi forces to surrender. During the war No. 75 Squadron flew a total of 350 sorties and dropped 122 laser-guided bombs.

Reports indicate that the No. 75 Squadron&#x27;s activities were somewhat restricted in their military role compared to similarly equipped US forces. Australian aircraft were not permitted to operate in the &quot;Baghdad SuperMEZ&quot; (Missile Exclusion Zone) because of fears that the Hornet&#x27;s electronic warfare systems were inadequate, though the report indicates that they were identical to American Hornets operating in this area. Furthermore, they were not permitted to conduct close air support missions in urban areas because of fears of collateral damage. These restrictions were in line with the rules of engagement set by the Australian Government, which were reportedly more restrictive than the rules governing the conduct of British and American forces.

The Australian C-130 transports and CH-47 helicopters provided airlift to Coalition forces, including the Australian Special Forces Task Group.

==Post-invasion operations – &quot;Operation Catalyst&quot;==

Following the capture of Baghdad Australian C-130 aircraft flew humanitarian supplies into the city. Almost all the forces deployed for the war returned to Australia shortly after the end of major fighting.

Unlike the three other countries which contributed combat forces to the war, Australia did not immediately contribute military forces to the post-war reconstruction of Iraq. Following victory, the Australian force in Iraq was limited to specialists attached to the Coalition headquarters in Baghdad and the search for Iraq&#x27;s suspected weapons of mass destruction, a frigate in the Persian Gulf, a party of air traffic controllers at Baghdad International Airport, two C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, two AP-3C Orion aircraft and small Security Detachment (SECDET) consisting of infantry, Armoured and support elements with the Military Police Close Protection Team protecting the Australian military units and diplomats based in Baghdad. This force was later expanded to include an Army training detachment and a small medical detachment attached to a US Air Force hospital. The Royal Australian Navy has also assumed command of coalition forces in the Persian Gulf on two occasions; Combined Task Force 58 in 2005 and Combined Task Force 158 in 2006.

The Australian Government refused requests made during 2003 and 2004 by the United States and United Nations to increase Australia&#x27;s contribution to the Multinational force in Iraq. In 2004 the government argued that assistance it had provided to prepare a Fijian force for Iraq met its obligation to contribute to security arrangements for the January 2005 Iraqi parliamentary election. In February 2005, however, the Australian government announced that the Australian Army would deploy a battlegroup to Al Muthanna Province to provide security for the Japanese engineers deployed to the province as well as to help train Iraqi security forces. This force — approximately 500 strong and equipped with armoured vehicles including ASLAVs and Bushmasters – named the Al Muthanna Task Group, commenced operations in April 2005. Following the withdrawal of the Japanese force and the transition of Al Muthanna to Iraqi control the Australian battlegroup relocated to Tallil Air Base in neighbouring Dhi Qar province in July 2006. The name AMTG was subsequently abandoned in favour of the title Overwatch Battle Group (West), reflecting the unit&#x27;s new role. Al Muthana and Dhi Qar are the westernmost of the four southern provinces and OBG(W) became the prime coalition intervention force in the western sector of the British Multi-National Division (South-East) (Iraq) (MND-SE) Area of Operations, with MND-SE based in the southern port city of Basrah. Responsibility for overwatch in Dhi Qar was subsequently assumed from the withdrawing Italian contingent in late October 2006, whilst OBG(W) continued to train Iraqi security forces. By late 2006 overall personnel numbers committed to Operation Catalyst (Iraq) had risen to 1400.

After the Labor Party achieved a landslide victory in the 2007 election, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd&#x27;s government withdrew Australian combat forces began from Iraq on 1 June 2008 and the Overwatch Battle Group (West) and Australian Army Training Team formally ceased combat operations on 2 June 2008, having helped train 33,000 Iraqi soldiers. Approximately 200 Australian personnel will remain in Iraq on logistical and air surveillance duties. All personnel other than those in SECDET and two officers attached to the United Nations will be withdrawn in July 2009.

==Casualties==
No Australian military personnel were killed in direct combat action during Operation Falconer or Operation Catalyst. One Australian soldier died in 2015 as a direct result of injuries sustained in an IED blast in 2004, three died in accidents or during service with British forces; many more have been wounded. Additionally as many as six Australians have been killed whilst working as private security contractors.

Matthew Millhouse, 36, was a trooper serving in the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, when the ASLAV he was driving was struck by a VBIED on the 25th of October 2004. He was knocked unconscious, but awoke and ran to the aid of LT Garth Callender who was severely injured. LT Callander later recovered from his physical wounds, but as a result of the blast TPR Millhouse was diagnosed with younger-onset dementia which claimed his life on 28 August 2015. He has since been listed on the Australian War Memorial Honour Roll as a casualty of the Iraq War.

Paul Pardoel, 35, was a flight lieutenant serving as a navigator in the RAF. He died when his C-130 Hercules from No 47 Squadron crashed in Iraq on 30 January 2005 killing all ten crew aboard. He was an Australian citizen serving in the British Armed Forces, having transferred from the RAAF in 2002. He was originally from Victoria.

David Nary, 42, was a warrant officer with the Australian Special Air Service Regiment. He was killed on 5 November 2005 after being struck by a vehicle during a training exercise in Kuwait prior to deployment to Iraq.

Jake Kovco, 25, was a private serving in the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR). He was part of the security detachment (SECDET) in Baghdad when he was killed on 21 April 2006 from a gunshot wound to the head that was believed to have been accidentally self-inflicted.

==Australian contribution in context==

===Scale of the Australian force commitment===
The Australian military contribution was relatively small in proportional terms, around 2,000 personnel in total, or 2.42% of its military compared to the United States 4.85% and the United Kingdom&#x27;s 12%.

With one obvious exception, the particular forces committed by the Australian Government can be seen by some as modest and to follow past practice closely. Australia committed special forces to the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in roughly similar numbers to those above. The two RAN frigates were already on-station for the Afghanistan campaign; &quot;Kanimbla&quot; was a relatively small addition to the naval force. RAN clearance divers also took part in the Gulf War.

Australia sent Hercules and Orion aircraft to assist in the Afghanistan campaign—but also Boeing 707 tankers, which had not been committed to the Gulf War, despite a marked Coalition shortage of probe/drogue capable tanker aircraft. The absence of the 707s was likely caused by technical rather than policy reasons: the RAAF has only four second-hand 707 tankers; all are at the end of their service lives, very difficult to maintain and soon to be replaced.

The commitment of No. 75 Squadron and its supporting personnel, however, was a major change from past practice. Australia did not commit combat aircraft to the 1991 Gulf War, and although a small detachment of Hornets was deployed to Diego Garcia during the Afghanistan campaign to provide airfield defence for the joint United States-United Kingdom military facility present there, this was not a true combat role, however, but simply a precaution against possible suicide attacks by hijacked civil aircraft. The commitment of No. 75 Squadron was the first combat deployment of Australian aircraft since the Vietnam War.

No official statement has been made on the reasons behind the choice of F/A-18 fighters as Australia&#x27;s primary combat commitment, but it is commonly assumed that the obvious alternative of sending a substantial land force instead was considered to involve an unacceptably high risk of casualties, particularly given the possibility of house-to-house fighting in Iraqi cities. Iraq is largely landlocked, and Australia no longer has a fixed-wing naval aviation component; thus, a larger naval commitment could not be considered particularly helpful. The choice of the F/A-18 deployment rather than of the F-111 tactical bomber may have been due to the higher cost of operation of the F-111, and its use being limited to more politically contentious ground attack missions rather than more uncontentious tasks like combat air patrols.

===Financial costs===
The cost of the Iraq war to Australian taxpayers is estimated to have exceeded A$5 billion. The cost of Australia&#x27;s involvement in Iraq has risen since the initial invasion gave way to a protracted insurgency. Excluding debt relief, the annual cost has risen from just over $400 million in 2003–04 to $576.6 million in the 2007 financial year. Ancillary costs included:
* $494.5 million in the base wage and personnel costs for Australian Defence Force troops deployed in Iraq not included in the net additional spending figures;
* $211.5 million spent by Foreign Affairs and other departments on aid, reconstruction, Australia&#x27;s diplomatic presence in Baghdad and tax concessions for soldiers; and
* $668 million in Iraqi debts waived by Australia.

==Events==

* c. 3190–3170 BC?: Reign of King Double Falcon of Lower Egypt. There is a strong possibility that he appears on the Palermo stone, although half his name is chipped away.
* c. 3195–3165 BC?: King Iry-Hor reigns from Abydos over most of Egypt.
* c. 3165–3141 BC: Reign of King Ka in Ancient Egypt.
* c. 3138 BC Ljubljana Marshes Wheel is a wooden wheel that was found in the Ljubljana Marsh in Slovenia. Radiocarbon dating showed that it is approximately 5,150 years old, which makes it the oldest wooden wheel yet discovered.
* c. 3141–3121 BC: Reign of Scorpion II in Upper Egypt..
* c. 3121 BC?: Beginning of the reign of Narmer, first pharaoh to unify Ancient Egypt and founder of the 1st Dynasty.
* c. 3100 BC: The earliest phase of Stonehenge construction begins.
* c. 3100 BC?: Malta: Construction of the Ħaġar Qim megalithic temples, featuring both solar and lunar alignments. &quot;Tarxien period&quot; of megalithic temple construction reaches its apex.
* c. 3100 BC?: Sumerian cuneiform writing system

* c. 3100 BC?: Neolithic settlement built at Skara Brae in the Orkney Islands, Scotland (pictured).
* c. 3100 BC?: Earliest buildings at the Ness of Brodgar in the Orkney Islands constructed.
* c. 3100 BC?: Neolithic people in Ireland build the 250,000-ton (230,000-tonne) Newgrange solar-oriented passage tomb.

==Calendar epochs==
*3114 BC: According to the most widely accepted correlations between the Western calendar and the calendar systems of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, the mythical starting point of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar cycle occurs in this year. The Long Count calendar, used and refined most notably by the Maya civilization but also attested in some other (earlier) Mesoamerican cultures, consisted of a series of interlocked cycles or periods of day-counts, which mapped out a linear sequence of days from a notional starting point. The system originated sometime in the Mid- to Late Preclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology, during the latter half of the 1st millennium BC. The starting point of the most commonly used highest-order cycle—the &quot;b&#x27;ak&#x27;tun&quot;-cycle consisting of thirteen b&#x27;ak&#x27;tuns of 144,000 days each—was projected back to an earlier, mythical date. This date is equivalent to 11 August 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar (or 6 September in the proleptic Julian calendar), using the correlation known as the &quot;Goodman-Martínez-Thompson (GMT) correlation&quot;. The GMT-correlation is worked out with the Long Count starting date equivalent to the Julian Day Number (JDN) equal to 584283, and is accepted by most Mayanist scholars as providing the best fit with the ethnohistorical data. Two succeeding dates, the 12th and 13 August (Gregorian) have also been supported, with the 13th (JDN = 584285, the &quot;astronomical&quot; or &quot;Lounsbury&quot; correlation) attracting significant support as according better with astronomical observational data. Although it is still contended which of these three dates forms the actual starting base of the Long Count, the correlation to one of this triad of dates is definitively accepted by almost all contemporary Mayanists. All other earlier or later correlation proposals are now discounted. The end of the thirteenth baktun was either on December 21 or 23 of 2012 (supposed end of the world).

*3102 BC: According to Puranic sources, Krishna&#x27;s death marked the start of &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;, which is dated to 17/18 February 3102 BCE. Lasting for 432,000 years (1,200 divine years), &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; began years ago and has years left as of 2025 CE. &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; will end in the year 428,899 CE.

<text>The 33rd century BC was a century that lasted from the year 3300 BC to 3201 BC. It is impossible to precisely date events that happened around the time of this century and all dates mentioned here are estimates mostly based on geological and anthropological analysis. The Bronze Age started in the 33rd century BC.

==Events==

* Major climate shift possibly due to shift in solar activity. Glaciers expand, covering plants; atmospheric temperatures fall
* Sahara changes from a habitable region into a barren desert
* Ancient Egypt begins using clay, bone and ivory tags to label boxes, possibly an example of proto-writing
* Indus Valley civilisation (also known as Harappan civilization) begins in Harappa
*c. 3300 BC: Archaeological evidence suggests the transition from Copper to Bronze took place around 3300 BC 
*c. 3300 BC: Harappan script is developed in Indus Valley
*c. 3300 BC: Pictographs in Uruk
* 3300 BC: to 3000 BC: Face of a woman, from Uruk (modern Warka, Iraq) is made; it is now in the Iraq Museum, Baghdad (stolen and recovered in 2003)
*c. 3300 BC: The &quot;Red Temple&quot;, the first phase of the Monte d&#x27;Accoddi sanctuary in Northwest Sardinia, is built
*3300-3000 BC: Evidence of proto-Thracians or proto-Dacians in the prehistoric period; Proto-Dacian or proto-Thracian people developed from a mixture of indigenous peoples and Indo-Europeans from the time of Proto-Indo-European expansion in the Early Bronze Age

==Inventions, discoveries, introductions==
* The Bronze Age begins in the Fertile Crescent (Roux, 1980)
* Cattle introduced to the Nile valley
* Egyptians domesticate the wild ass of North Africa (Clutton-Brock)
* c. 3250 BC – Potter&#x27;s wheel in use in Ancient Near East

<text>The Karelian Isthmus (; ; ) is the approximately stretch of land situated between the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga in northwestern Russia, to the north of the River Neva. Its northwestern boundary is a line from the Bay of Vyborg to the westernmost point of Lake Ladoga, Pekonlahti. If the Karelian Isthmus is defined as the entire territory of present-day Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast to the north of the Neva and also a tiny part of the Republic of Karelia, the area of the isthmus is about .

The smaller part of the isthmus to the southeast of the old Russia-Finland border is considered historically as Northern Ingria, rather than part of the Karelian Isthmus itself. The rest of the isthmus was historically a part of Finnish Karelia. This was conquered by the Russian Empire during the Great Northern War in 1712 and included within the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland (1809–1917) of the Russian Empire. When Finland became independent in 1917, the isthmus (except for the territory roughly corresponding to present-day Vsevolozhsky District and some districts of Saint Petersburg) remained Finnish. Finnish Karelia was partly ceded to the Soviet Union by Finland following the Winter War (1939–1940) and Continuation War (1941–1944). In 1940–1941, during the Interim Peace, most of the ceded territories in the isthmus were included within the Karelo-Finnish SSR. However, since World War II the entire isthmus has been divided between the city of Saint Petersburg (mostly Kurortny District), as well as Priozersky District, Vsevolozhsky District and Vyborgsky District of Leningrad Oblast.

According to the 2002 census, the population of the Kurortny District of Saint Petersburg and the parts of Leningrad Oblast situated on the Karelian Isthmus amounts to 539,000. Many Saint Petersburg residents also decamp to the Isthmus during their vacations. The main population centers of the Isthmus are Vyborg (&quot;Выборг&quot;; ; ), Priozersk (&quot;Приозе́рск&quot;; ; ) and Primorsk (&quot;Примо́рск&quot;; ; ).

==Geography and wildlife==


The isthmus&#x27; terrain has been influenced dramatically by the Weichselian glaciation. Its highest point lies on the Lembolovo Heights moraine at about 205 m (670 ft). There are no mountains on the isthmus, but steep hills occur in some places.

The Vuoksi, the largest river, runs southeastwards from Lake Saimaa of Finland to Lake Ladoga, dividing the isthmus into two uneven parts. Saimaa Canal opened in 1856 links Lake Saimaa to the Bay of Vyborg passing through the city of Lappeenranta in South Karelia, Finland.

The Karelian Isthmus lies within the ecoregion of Scandinavian and Russian taiga. Geobotanically, it lies at the juncture of the Central European, Eastern European and Northern European floristic provinces of the Circumboreal Region of the Holarctic Kingdom.

The isthmus is mostly covered by coniferous forests formed by Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;) and Norway spruce (&quot;Picea abies&quot;), with numerous lakes (e.g. Lake Sukhodolskoye and Lake Glubokoye) as well as small grass, fen and &quot;Sphagnum&quot; raised bogs. Forests cover approximately 11,700 km of the isthmus, more than three quarters of its total area. Swampy areas occupy 5.5 percent of the territory. In the large contiguous area along the shore of Lake Ladoga in Vsevolozhsky District, in the southeastern part of the isthmus, bogs occur much more frequently than in other parts. The same was once true of the lowland along the Neva River, which has since been drained. The soil is predominantly podsol, which contains massive boulders, especially in the north and northwest, where large granite rocky outcrops occur.

Pine forests (with &quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;) are the most widespread and occupy 51% of the forested area of the Karelian Isthmus, followed by spruce forests (with &quot;Picea abies&quot;, 29%) and birch forests (with &quot;Betula pendula&quot; and &quot;B. pubescens&quot;, 16%). Stands on more fertile soils and in more favorable locations are occasionally dominated by Norway maple, black alder, grey alder, common aspen, English oak, grey willow, dark-leaved willow, tea-leaved willow, small-leaved lime or European white elm. Common vegetation of various types of pine forests includes heather, crowberry, common juniper, eared willow, lingonberry, water horsetail, bracken, graminoids (i.e. grasses in the wider sense) &quot;Avenella flexuosa&quot; and &quot;Carex globularis&quot;, mosses &quot;Pleurozium schreberi&quot;, &quot;Sphagnum angustifolium&quot; and &quot;S. russowii&quot;, and lichens &quot;Cladonia&quot; spp. Prominent in various spruce forests are wood horsetail, common wood sorrel, bilberry, lingonberry, graminoids &quot;Avenella flexuosa&quot;, &quot;Calamagrostis arundinacea&quot;, &quot;Carex globularis&quot;, and mosses &quot;Polytrichum commune&quot; and &quot;Sphagnum girgensohnii&quot;. Prominent vegetation of various birch forests include meadowsweet, common wood sorrel, bilberry and graminoids &quot;Calamagrostis arundinacea&quot; and &quot;C. canescens&quot;.

1184 species of wild vascular plants are recorded in the isthmus. See also the List of the vascular plants of the Karelian Isthmus. Red squirrel, moose, red fox, mountain hare and boar (reintroduced) are typical inhabitants of the forests.

The climate of the isthmus is moderately continental, with 650–800 mm (25–32 in) average precipitation per year, long snowy winters lasting from November through mid-April and occasionally reaching about -40 °C (-40 F), moderately cool summers and short frost-free period. Compared to other parts of the Leningrad Oblast, the winter here is usually milder due to the moderating influence of the Gulf of Finland, but longer.

The city of Vyborg and the town of Priozersk are situated on the northwestern part of the isthmus.

The Karelian Isthmus is a popular place for hiking, cycling, skiing (Korobitsyno and Kavgolovo), climbing (near Kuznechnoye), canoeing (Losevo), fishing for consumption (of carp bream, northern pike, roach, European perch, ruffe, burbot and others), mushroom hunting (for porcini, red-capped scaber stalk, birch bolete, velvet bolete, slippery Jack, golden chanterelle, &quot;Lactarius resimus&quot;, woolly milk-cap, ugly milk-cap, saffron milk-cap, &quot;Lactarius rufus&quot;, various Russulas and others), berry picking (of bilberry, raspberry, woodland strawberry, cowberry, cranberry, cloudberry, bog bilberry and stone bramble). It is a popular summer resort for Saint Petersburg citizens since the late 19th century, served by trains of Finlyandsky Rail Terminal. The isthmus, especially the land along Saint Petersburg–Vyborg and Saint Petersburg–Priozersk railroads, hosts numerous dachas.

A 20–35 km wide stretch of land in Vyborgsky District and Republic of Karelia to the west of the Vyborg–Hiitola railway, as well as the islands and shores of the Gulf of Vyborg, belongs to the strictly guarded zone of the border control, reaching the shore of Lake Ladoga at Hiitola. In 1993–2006 the zone was formally 5 km wide, although in fact it has always been much wider. Visiting it is forbidden without a permit issued by the FSB (by KGB during the time of the Soviet Union).

===Geological history===

Geologically the Karelian Isthmus lies on the southern edge of the Baltic Shield&#x27;s crystalline bedrock. During the final part of the last Weichselian glaciation, deglaciation in the central parts of the Isthmus started as early as 14000 BP, when it formed the bottom of a large lake dammed by the surrounding ice sheet. During further deglaciation, at the time of the Baltic Ice Lake, an early high water stage of the Baltic Sea, when the ice sheet retreated to Salpausselkä, the upland area of the Isthmus remained a large island and many upland lakes emerged.

Prior to 12650 BP, the land was characterized by harsh Arctic conditions with permafrost and sparse vegetation. Steppe-tundra complexes developed after this point. Around 11000 BP climate began to warm and became humid, first pine and birch forests were established.

Around 9000 BP Ancylus Lake, another stage of the Baltic Sea, retreated, and many lowland lakes were also isolated in depressions formed earlier by glacial exaration and fluvioglacial activity. Lake Ladoga was separated from the sea as well. Due to land uplift, around 5000 BP the River Vuoksi started emptying into Lake Ladoga as a new outlet of Lake Saimaa. Lake Ladoga transgressed, flooding lowland lakes and the Vuoksi, and became connected with the sea at Heinjoki (now Veshchevo), to the east of present-day Vyborg. Around 3100–2400 BP the Neva River emerged, draining Lake Ladoga into the Baltic Sea. Ladoga level gradually sank from 15–18 m to its modern position of 4–5 m above sea-level, and lowland lakes were isolated again. However, the Vuoksi still had a significant direct outflow connection to the Bay of Vyborg, possibly as late as in the 12th century AD. The connection disappeared due to ongoing land uplift in the 2nd millennium AD.

In 1818 a canal, which was dug to drain spring flood waters from Lake Suvanto (now Lake Sukhodolskoye, a 40-km long narrow lake in the eastern part of the Isthmus) into Lake Ladoga, unexpectedly eroded and turned into the Taipaleenjoki (now Burnaya River). The Taipaleenjoki started draining Suvanto and decreased its level by 7 m. Originally waters of Lake Suvanto flowed into the Vuoksi River through a waterway at Kiviniemi (now Losevo), but as a result of the change, the waterway dried out. In 1857 the canal was dug there, but the stream reversed direction, revealed rapids and rendered navigation at Kiviniemi impossible. Since 1857 Suvanto and the Taipaleenjoki have constituted the southern armlet of the Vuoksi River, which has decreased the level of the original northern armlet emptying into Ladoga near Kexholm (now Priozersk) by 4 m, isolating it as a separate river basin.

The Karelian Isthmus is located in two regions of the Russian Federation, Saint Petersburg and the Leningrad Oblast. Saint Petersburg is represented by seven districts, the Leningrad Oblast by three.
==History==

===Archaeology===

Apart from the old towns of Vyborg and Priozersk, and churches on the Konevets island of Lake Ladoga, since the late 19th century a number of other archaeological sites have been discovered on the isthmus. Numerous archaeological remnants of the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Copper Age and Bronze Age occur all over the isthmus. The eastern part of the Karelian Isthmus hosts a number of medieval remnants. There are many grave pits of Karelians of the 10th–15th centuries with metal and ceramic artifacts along the northern armlet of the Vuoksi, near Lake Sukhodolskoye and in a few other places in Priozersky District. On the southern shore of Lake Sukhodolskoye small medieval burial mounds are abundant as well. A lot of large cult stones have been found along these bodies of water, as well as agglomerations of cairns. Remnants of several rural settlements were also discovered there as well as on the shore of Lake Ladoga. Remnants of the Tiuri (Tiversk) town (10th–15th centuries) were excavated on a former island in the northern Vuoksi armlet near the Tiuri village (now Vasilyevo). A few treasures of silver adornments and medieval Arabian and Western European coins have also been found, as the isthmus laid on the Volga trade route (at that time, the Vuoksi River had a distributary emptying into the Bay of Vyborg).

===Prehistory and Medieval===
Ancestors of Baltic Finns wandered to the Karelian Isthmus possibly around 8500BC.

In the 11th century, Sweden and Novgorod Republic started to compete tax holding rights. The Treaty of Nöteborg of 1323 established a border between them along the rivers now known as the Sestra and the Volchya.

===17th–20th centuries===
During 17th century Sweden gained the whole isthmus and also Ingria. In this time many Karelians escaped to Tver&#x27;s Karelia.

From 1721–1917 the isthmus belonged to the Russian Empire, won in the Great Northern War that started with the Russian conquest of Ingria where the new imperial capital, Saint Petersburg, was founded (1703) in the southern end of the isthmus, in place of old Swedish town Nyenskans. Then in 1812, the northwestern half was transferred, as a part of Old Finland, to the Grand Duchy of Finland, created in 1809 as an autonomous part of the Russian Empire. 

Due to its size, favorable climate, rich fishing waters and proximity to Saint Petersburg, the capital of the Russian Empire, the Karelian Isthmus became the wealthiest part of Finland once the Industrial Revolution had gained momentum in the 19th century. The railroads Saint Petersburg–Vyborg–Riihimäki (1870), Vyborg–Hiitola–Sortavala (1893), Saint Petersburg–Kexholm–Hiitola (1917) crossed the isthmus, contributing to its economic development. By the end of the 19th century the nearby areas along the Saint Petersburg–Vyborg section had become popular place of summer resort for wealthy Saint Petersburgers.
When Finland declared its independence in 1917, the isthmus (except for the territory roughly corresponding to present-day Vsevolozhsky District and some districts of Saint Petersburg) remained Finnish, part of the Viipuri province with its center in Viipuri, the fourth largest Finnish city. A considerable part of the remaining area populated by Ingrian Finns seceded from Bolshevist Russia as the Finland-backed Republic of North Ingria, but was reintegrated with Russia in the end of 1920 according to the conditions of the Treaty of Tartu. In 1928–1939 parts of the isthmus which belonged to Russia constituted the Kuivaisi National District with its center in Toksova, with Finnish as the official language, according to the policy of national delimitation in the Soviet Union. However, in 1936 the entire Finnish population of the parishes of Valkeasaari, Lempaala, Vuole and Miikkulainen along the Finnish border was deported to Siberia and Central Asia, and replaced by a Russian-speaking population.

===World War II===


A number of defensive lines crossed the isthmus during the Soviet-Finnish hostilities in World War II, such as Mannerheim Line, VKT-line, VT-line, Main line (Finnish) and KaUR (Soviet), and fronts moved back and forth over it.

In November 1939, the Soviet Union staged the Shelling of Mainila and invaded Finland in what became known as the Winter War, which took a disproportionally heavy death toll on the Red Army. Only in February 1940 did the Soviet forces manage to penetrate the Mannerheim Line across the isthmus, the strength of which is often exaggerated. Finland ceded the Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia to the Soviet Union in the Peace of Moscow of 12 March. According to the protocol appended to the Moscow Peace Treaty, the fighting was ended at noon (Leningrad time) on 13 March and by 26 March the Finnish troops had been completely withdrawn. The entire Karelian population of the ceded areas of about 422 thousand people was evacuated to other parts of Finland (see Evacuation of Finnish Karelia). On 31 March most of the ceded territories were incorporated into Karelo-Finnish SSR by a decision of the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union (in the Karelian Isthmus the districts of Jääski, Kexholm and Vyborg). The districts of Kanneljärvi, Koivisto and Rautu as well as the town of Terijoki were, however, included into Leningrad Oblast.
In 1941, during World War II, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. A few days later was the beginning of the Continuation War as it is known in Finland. (It is considered to be a front of the Great Patriotic War in the Soviet Union and Russia.) Finland initially regained the lost territory, reaching the Russian side of the border of 1939 in what was seen by the Russians as indirectly contributing to the Siege of Leningrad (see Finnish reconquest of the Karelian Isthmus (1941)). Some 260,000 Karelian evacuees returned home.

On 9 June 1944, strong Soviet forces opened the Vyborg Offensive and pushed the front from the pre-1939 border to Vyborg in ten days. The returned Karelians were evacuated to Finland again. In the Battle of Tali-Ihantala, 25 June–9 July, the Finns concentrated their military strength and brought the offensive to a halt at the River Vuoksi, in the northwesternmost part of the isthmus, at the closest point only 40 kilometres from the border of 1940. The Moscow Armistice ending the war was signed on 19 September 1944. The entire isthmus became Soviet, although most of it had never been captured by the Soviets in battles. This time the ceded territories of the Karelian Isthmus (including the districts of Jääski, Kexholm and Vyborg) were incorporated into Leningrad Oblast (unlike Ladoga Karelia, which remained within the Karelo-Finnish SSR). The border of the Moscow Peace Treaty (1940) was recognized by Finland again in the Peace of Paris, 1947. 

===After the war===

As a result of the war, the population of the Karelian Isthmus was almost completely replaced. After the war the isthmus was included in the Leningrad Oblast and people from other parts of the Soviet Union, mostly Russians, were settled there. The vast majority of the old Finnish in the conquered territories were renamed to invented Russian ones by the government around 1948. The Finnish toponyms of the territories included within Karelo-Finnish SSR and of the southern part of the isthmus (albeit assimilated) mostly remained. A lot of youth summer camps were built all over the isthmus during the time of the Soviet Union. Some of them still exist.

==Transport==
The western part of the Karelian Isthmus is an important transport corridor linking Scandinavia and Central Russia. Primorsk, terminus of the Baltic Pipeline System, which has recently become one of the most efficient Russian sea ports, is also located here.

The only motorway on the isthmus is the recently completed E18 &quot;Scandinavia&quot; (M10) going from Saint Petersburg through Vyborg and Vaalimaa.

Saimaa Canal (opened in 1856) is an important link connecting inland waterways of Finland with the Gulf of Finland.

The Karelian Isthmus is served by a number of railways; the trains arrive from Finlyandsky Rail Terminal and Ladozhsky Rail Terminal of Saint Petersburg:
* Saint Petersburg-Hiitola railroad
* eastern part of the Saint Petersburg-Riihimäki railroad
* Saint Petersburg – Sestroretsk – Beloostrov
* southern part of the Vyborg-Joensuu railroad
* Saint Petersburg – Vsevolozhsk – Ladozhskoye Ozero
* Saint Petersburg – Vsevolozhsk – Petrokrepost – Nevskaya Dubrovka
* Vyborg – Veschevo (earlier also through Zhitkovo to Michurinskoye)
* Kamennogorsk – Svetogorsk – Imatra
* Zelenogorsk – Primorsk – Sovetsky – Vyborg
Also on the Karelian isthmus are all lines of the St. Petersburg metro.

==Industry==
The pulp-and-paper, timber and woodworking industries (&quot;JSC Svetogorsk&quot;, pulp and paper mill in Svetogorsk, &quot;Vyborgsky Pulp and Paper Mill&quot; in Vyborg, &quot;Priozersky Furniture and Woodworking Industrial Complex&quot; and &quot;Priozersky Woodworking Factory&quot; in Priozersk, as well as other smaller enterprises all over the isthmus) are well developed in Vyborgsky and Priozersky Districts. The pulp and paper industry, however, affects the environment adversely. The predecessor of the Priozersk facilities, &quot;Priozersky Pulp and Paper Mill&quot;, a major polluter of Lake Ladoga constructed in 1931, was closed down in 1986. Northern and western parts of the isthmus are also an important reserve of granite (quarries in Kuznechnoye, as well as a number of others along the Vyborg-Hiitola railroad).

&quot;Vyborg Shipyard&quot; is one of the largest shipbuilding companies in Northwestern Russia. &quot;Roskar Battery Farm&quot; in Pervomayskoye is a leading producer of chicken and eggs.

In Vsevolozhsky District state-owned &quot;Morozov Plant&quot; is located, which is an important producer of paints, adhesives, abrasives and other substances. In Kuzmolovsky, Vsevolozhsky District, near the station Kapitolovo of the Saint Petersburg–Hiitola railroad, a facility of the Saint Petersburg nuclear enterprise &quot;Izotop&quot; is located, which specializes in transportation of nuclear materials and radioactive waste. Bogs of Vsevolozhsky District along the shores of Lake Ladoga and the Neva River were major sources of peat for fuel. Now it is extracted in smaller quantities, mostly for agricultural purposes. The district is also an important supplier of sand. A plant of Ford Motor Company producing Ford Focus cars was opened in Vsevolozhsk in 2002.

==Military==
The Karelian Isthmus is included within Leningrad Military District of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The isthmus hosts airfields in Levashovo, Pribylovo and Gromovo. Other airfields in Veshchevo and Kasimovo (Vartemyagi) have been abandoned. In the northern part of Vsevolozhsky District, to the south of the old Finnish border, Karelian Fortified Region (KaUR) is located, which was reconstructed as late as in the 1960s, but now is abandoned as well. There is &quot;Bobochinsky tank range&quot; (195.975 km², founded in 1913) between Kamenka and Kirillovskoye and a number of military facilities in Vsevolozhsky District in the lowlands between Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg-Hiitola railroad, including &quot;Rzhevsky artillery range&quot; (founded in 1879), a huge area, , encircled by the Road of Life, the roads Rzhevka – Novoye Devyatkino and Novoye Devyatkino – Matoksa and the coast of Lake Ladoga (available to visitors since 2003). In 2006 a Voronezh early warning radar was built in Lekhtusi, Vsevolozhsky District. The port of Vysotsk is a base of the Baltic Fleet. 138th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade is located in Kamenka, and in the 56th District Training Centre in Sertolovo.

== Population ==
The population of the Karelian isthmus today is slightly less than 3.1 million inhabitants. Of these, about 2.4 million live in St. Petersburg and a little less than 700 thousand in the Leningrad region. The population is growing solely due to migration, as the mortality rate is much higher than the birth rate, but the migration attractiveness of St. Petersburg and the surrounding areas of the Leningrad region is very high. Thus, about 40% of the population of St. Petersburg and about 30% of the population of the Leningrad region live on the Karelian isthmus. There is strong growth in population in all the districts of the Karelian isthmus in addition to the Vyborg district and Priozersk district .

<text>During the 40th century BC, the Eastern Mediterranean region was in the Chalcolithic period (Copper Age), transitional between the Stone and the Bronze Ages. Northwestern Europe was in the Neolithic. China was dominated by the Neolithic Yangshao culture. The Americas were in a phase of transition between the Paleo-Indian (Lithic) to the Meso-Indian (Archaic) stage. This century started in 4000 BC and ended in 3901 BC.

<text>The depiction of Jesus in pictorial form dates back to early Christian art and architecture, as aniconism in Christianity was rejected within the ante-Nicene period. It took several centuries to reach a conventional standardized form for his physical appearance, which has subsequently remained largely stable since that time. Most images of Jesus have in common a number of traits which are now almost universally associated with Jesus, although variants are seen.

The conventional image of a fully bearded Jesus with long hair emerged around AD 300, but did not become established until the 6th century in Eastern Christianity, and much later in the West. It has always had the advantage of being easily recognizable, and distinguishing Jesus from other figures shown around him, which the use of a cruciform halo also achieves. Earlier images were much more varied.

Images of Jesus tend to show ethnic characteristics similar to those of the culture in which the image has been created. Beliefs that certain images are historically authentic, or have acquired an authoritative status from Church tradition, remain powerful among some of the faithful, in Eastern Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, Anglicanism, and Roman Catholicism. The Shroud of Turin is now the best-known example, though the Image of Edessa and the Veil of Veronica were better known in medieval times.

The representation of Jesus was controversial in the early period; the regional Synod of Elvira in Spain in 306 states in its 36th canon that no images should be in churches. Later, in the Eastern church, Byzantine iconoclasm banned and destroyed images of Christ for a period, before they returned in full strength. In the 16th-century Protestant Reformation, the followers of John Calvin in particular saw images of Christ as idolatrous and enforced their removal. Due to their understanding of the second of the Ten Commandments, most Evangelical Protestants still avoid displaying representations of Jesus in their places of worship.

== Early Christianity ==
=== Before Constantine ===

Except for Jesus wearing tzitzit—the tassels on a tallit—in Matthew 14:36 and Luke 8:43–44, there is no physical description of Jesus contained in any of the canonical Gospels. In the Acts of the Apostles, Jesus is said to have manifested as a &quot;light from heaven&quot; that temporarily blinded the Apostle Paul, but no specific form is given. In the Book of Revelation there is a vision the author had of &quot;someone like a Son of Man&quot; in spirit form: &quot;dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. The hair on his head were white like wool, and his eyes were like blazing fire. His feet were like burnt bronze glowing in a furnace (...) His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance&quot; (Revelation 1:12–16, NIV). Use in art of the Revelation description of Jesus has generally been restricted to illustrations of the book itself, and nothing in the scripture confirms the spiritual form&#x27;s resemblance to the physical form Jesus took in his life on Earth.

In the first-century AD, many Jews understood Exodus 20:4–6 (&quot;Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image&quot;) as a proscription against any depiction of humans or animals. Consequently, no figure art was produced for, or by, the Jewish communities in Judea and Galilee during Jesus&#x27; lifetime, or in the decades that followed. But attitudes towards the interpretation of this Commandment changed through the centuries, and by the third century, some Jewish communities were producing figure art. The frescos decorating the interior of Dura-Europos synagogue (c. 240 AD) depict many scenes from the Tanakh. They are the earliest-known examples of Jewish figure art.

During the persecution of Christians under the Roman Empire, Christian art was necessarily furtive and ambiguous, and there was hostility to idols in a group still with a large component of members with Jewish origins, surrounded by, and polemicising against, sophisticated pagan images of gods. Irenaeus (d. c. 202), Clement of Alexandria (d. 215), Lactantius (c. 240–c. 320) and Eusebius of Caesarea (d. c. 339) disapproved of portrayals in images of Jesus. The 36th canon of the non-ecumenical Synod of Elvira in 306 AD reads, &quot;It has been decreed that no pictures be had in the churches, and that which is worshipped or adored be not painted on the walls&quot;, which has been interpreted by John Calvin and other Protestants as an interdiction of the making of images of Christ. The issue remained the subject of controversy until the end of the 4th century.

The earliest surviving Christian art comes from the late 2nd to early 4th centuries on the walls of tombs belonging, most likely, to wealthy Christians in the catacombs of Rome, although from literary evidence there may well have been panel icons which, like almost all classical painting, have disappeared.

Initially Jesus was represented indirectly by pictogram symbols such as the ichthys (fish), the peacock, or an anchor (the Labarum or Chi-Rho was a later development). The staurogram seems to have been a very early representation of the crucified Jesus within the sacred texts. Later personified symbols were used, including Jonah, whose three days in the belly of the whale pre-figured the interval between Christ&#x27;s death and resurrection; Daniel in the lion&#x27;s den; or Orpheus charming the animals. The image of &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot;, a beardless youth in pastoral scenes collecting sheep, was the most common of these images, and was probably not understood as a portrait of the historical Jesus at this period. It continues the classical Kriophoros (&quot;ram-bearer&quot; figure), and in some cases may also represent the Shepherd of Hermas, a popular Christian literary work of the 2nd century.

Among the earliest depictions clearly intended to directly represent Jesus himself are many showing him as a baby, usually held by his mother, especially in the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;, seen as the first theophany, or display of the incarnate Christ to the world at large. The oldest known portrait of Jesus, found in Syria and dated to about 235, shows him as a beardless young man of authoritative and dignified bearing. He is depicted with close-cropped hair and wearing a tunic and pallium—the common male dress for much of Greco-Roman society, and similar to that found in the figure art in the Dura-Europos Synagogue. 

The appearance of Jesus had some theological implications. While some Christians thought Jesus should have the beautiful appearance of a young classical hero, and the Gnostics tended to think he could change his appearance at will, for which they cited the Meeting at Emmaus as evidence, others including the Church Fathers Justin (d. 165) and Tertullian (d. 220) believed, following Isaiah 53:2, that Christ&#x27;s appearance was unremarkable: &quot;he had no form nor comeliness, that we should look upon him, nor beauty that we should delight in him.&quot; But when the pagan Celsus ridiculed the Christian religion for having an ugly God in about 180, Origen (d. 248) cited Psalm 45:3: &quot;Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, mighty one, with thy beauty and fairness&quot; Later the emphasis of leading Christian thinkers changed; Jerome (d. 420) and Augustine of Hippo (d. 430) argued that Jesus must have been ideally beautiful in face and body. For Augustine he was &quot;beautiful as a child, beautiful on earth, beautiful in heaven.&quot;


From the 3rd century onwards, the first narrative scenes from the &quot;Life of Christ&quot; to be clearly seen are the &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot;, painted in a catacomb in about 200, and the miracle of the &quot;Raising of Lazarus&quot;, both of which can be clearly identified by the inclusion of the dove of the Holy Spirit in &quot;Baptisms&quot;, and the vertical, shroud-wrapped body of Lazarus. Other scenes remain ambiguous—an &quot;agape feast&quot; may be intended as a &quot;Last Supper&quot;, but before the development of a recognised physical appearance for Christ, and attributes such as the halo, it is impossible to tell, as &quot;tituli&quot; or captions are rarely used. There are some surviving scenes from Christ&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; of about 235 from the Dura Europos church on the Persian frontier of the Empire. During the 4th century a much greater number of scenes came to be depicted, usually showing Christ as youthful, beardless and with short hair that does not reach his shoulders, although there is considerable variation.

Jesus is sometimes shown performing miracles by means of a wand, as on the doors of Santa Sabina in Rome (430–32). He uses the wand to change water to wine, multiply the bread and fishes, and raise Lazarus. When pictured healing, he only lays on hands. The wand is thought to be a symbol of power. The bare-faced youth with the wand may indicate that Jesus was thought of as a user of magic or wonder worker by some of the early Christians. No art has been found picturing Jesus with a wand before the 2nd century. Some scholars suggest that the Gospel of Mark, the Secret Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John (the so-called Signs Gospel), portray such a wonder worker, user of magic, a magician or a Divine man. Only the Apostle Peter is also depicted in ancient art with a wand. Research by Lee M. Jefferson however, argued that the depiction of Jesus holding a wand is not an attempt to portray Jesus as a magician or magic user, but rather a continuity of biblical tradition of Moses&#x27;s staff. It is also argued that early Christians were strong in their rejection of magic and anything related to it.

Another depiction, seen from the late 3rd century or early 4th century onwards, showed Jesus with a beard, and within a few decades can be very close to the conventional type that later emerged. This depiction has been said to draw variously on Imperial imagery, the type of the classical philosopher, and that of Zeus, leader of the Greek gods, or Jupiter, his Roman equivalent, and the protector of Rome. According to art historian Paul Zanker, the bearded type has long hair from the start, and a relatively long beard (contrasting with the short &quot;classical&quot; beard and hair always given to St Peter, and most other apostles); this depiction is specifically associated with &quot;Charismatic&quot; philosophers like Euphrates the Stoic, Dio of Prusa and Apollonius of Tyana, some of whom were claimed to perform miracles.

After the very earliest examples of c. 300, this depiction is mostly used for hieratic images of Jesus, and scenes from his life are more likely to use a beardless, youthful type. The tendency of older scholars such as Talbot Rice to see the beardless Jesus as associated with a &quot;classical&quot; artistic style and the bearded one as representing an &quot;Eastern&quot; one drawing from ancient Syria, Mesopotamia and Persia seems impossible to sustain, and does not feature in more recent analyses. Equally attempts to relate on a consistent basis the explanation for the type chosen in a particular work to the differing theological views of the time have been unsuccessful. From the 3rd century on, some Christian leaders, such as Clement of Alexandria, had recommended the wearing of beards by Christian men. The centre parting was also seen from early on, and was also associated with long-haired philosophers.
=== After Constantine ===
From the middle of the 4th century, after Christianity was legalized by the Edict of Milan in 313, and gained Imperial favour, there was a new range of images of Christ the King, using either of the two physical types described above, but adopting the costume and often the poses of Imperial iconography. These developed into the various forms of Christ in Majesty. Some scholars reject the connection between the political events and developments in iconography, seeing the change as a purely theological one, resulting from the shift of the concept and title of Pantocrator (&quot;Ruler of all&quot;) from God the Father (still not portrayed in art) to Christ, which was a development of the same period, perhaps led by Athanasius of Alexandria (d. 373).

Another depiction drew from classical images of philosophers, often shown as a youthful &quot;intellectual wunderkind&quot; in Roman sarcophagii; the &quot;Traditio Legis&quot; image initially uses this type. Gradually Jesus became shown as older, and during the 5th century the image with a beard and long hair, now with a cruciform halo, came to dominate, especially in the Eastern Empire. In the earliest large New Testament mosaic cycle, in Sant&#x27;Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna (c. 520), Jesus is beardless through the period of his ministry until the scenes of the Passion, after which he is shown with a beard.

The Good Shepherd, now clearly identified as Christ, with halo and often rich robes, is still depicted, as on the apse mosaic in the church of Santi Cosma e Damiano in Rome, where the twelve apostles are depicted as twelve sheep below the imperial Jesus, or in the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia at Ravenna.

Once the bearded, long-haired Jesus became the conventional representation of Jesus, his facial features slowly began to be standardised, although this process took until at least the 6th century in the Eastern Church, and much longer in the West, where clean-shaven Jesuses are common until the 12th century, despite the influence of Byzantine art. But by the late Middle Ages the beard became almost universal and when Michelangelo showed a clean-shaven Apollo-like Christ in his &quot;Last Judgment&quot; fresco in the Sistine Chapel (1534–41) he came under persistent attack in the Counter-Reformation climate of Rome for this, as well as other things.

French scholar Paul Vignon has listed fifteen similarities, or &quot;marks,&quot; between most of the icons of Jesus after this point, particularly in the icons of &quot;Christ Pantocrator&quot; (&quot;The all-powerful Messiah&quot;). He claims that these are due to the availability of the Image of Edessa (which he claims to be identical to the Shroud of Turin) to the artists, via Constantinople. Certainly images believed to have miraculous origins, or the Hodegetria, believed to be a portrait of Mary from the life by Saint Luke, were widely regarded as authoritative by the Early Medieval period and greatly influenced depictions. In Eastern Orthodoxy the form of images was, and largely is, regarded as revealed truth, with a status almost equal to scripture, and the aim of artists is to copy earlier images without originality, although the style and content of images does in fact change slightly over time.

As to the historical appearance of Jesus, in one possible translation of the apostle Paul&#x27;s First Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul urges Christian men of first-century Corinth not to have long hair. An early commentary by Pelagius (c. AD 354 – c. AD 420/440) says, &quot;Paul was complaining because men were fussing about their hair and women were flaunting their locks in church. Not only was this dishonoring to them, but it was also an incitement to fornication.&quot; Some have speculated that Jesus and/or Paul were Nazirites, a temporary vow during which hair is not cut. Critics emphasize that at the time, long hair on men was considered shameful as Paul states in I Corinthians 11:14. Jesus was a practicing Jew so presumably had a beard.

== Later periods ==
By the 5th century depictions of the Passion began to appear, perhaps reflecting a change in the theological focus of the early Church. The 6th-century Rabbula Gospels includes some of the earliest surviving images of the crucifixion and resurrection. By the 6th century the bearded depiction of Jesus had become standard in the East, though the West, especially in northern Europe, continued to mix bearded and unbearded depictions for several centuries. The depiction with a longish face, long straight brown hair parted in the middle, and almond shaped eyes shows consistency from the 6th century to the present. Various legends developed which were believed to authenticate the historical accuracy of the standard depiction, such as the image of Edessa and later the Veil of Veronica.

Partly to aid recognition of the scenes, narrative depictions of the Life of Christ focused increasingly on the events celebrated in the major feasts of the church calendar, and the events of the Passion, neglecting the miracles and other events of Jesus&#x27; public ministry, except for the raising of Lazarus, where the mummy-like wrapped body was shown standing upright, giving an unmistakable visual signature. A cruciform halo was worn only by Jesus (and the other persons of the Trinity), while plain halos distinguished Mary, the Apostles and other saints, helping the viewer to read increasingly populated scenes.

The period of Byzantine Iconoclasm acted as a barrier to developments in the East, but by the 9th century art was permitted again. The Transfiguration of Jesus was a major theme in the East and every Eastern Orthodox monk who had trained in icon painting had to prove his craft by painting an icon of the Transfiguration. However, while Western depictions increasingly aimed at realism, in Eastern icons a low regard for perspective and alterations in the size and proportion of an image aim to reach beyond earthly reality to a spiritual meaning.

The 13th century witnessed a turning point in the portrayal of the powerful Kyrios image of Jesus as a wonder worker in the West, as the Franciscans began to emphasize the humility of Jesus both at his birth and his death via the nativity scene as well as the crucifixion. The Franciscans approached both ends of this spectrum of emotions and as the joys of the Nativity of were added to the agony of crucifixion a whole new range of emotions were ushered in, with wide-ranging cultural impact on the image of Jesus for centuries thereafter.
After Giotto, Fra Angelico and others systematically developed uncluttered images that focused on the depiction of Jesus with an ideal human beauty, in works like Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Last Supper&quot;, arguably the first High Renaissance painting. Images of Jesus now drew on classical sculpture, at least in some of their poses. However Michelangelo was considered to have gone much too far in his beardless Christ in his &quot;The Last Judgment&quot; fresco in the Sistine Chapel, which very clearly adapted classical sculptures of Apollo, and this path was rarely followed by other artists.

The High Renaissance was contemporary with the start of the Protestant Reformation which, especially in its first decades, violently objected to almost all public religious images as idolatrous, and vast numbers were destroyed. Gradually images of Jesus became acceptable to most Protestants in various contexts, especially in narrative contexts, as book illustrations and prints, and later in larger paintings. Protestant art continued the now-standard depiction of the physical appearance of Jesus. Meanwhile, the Catholic Counter-Reformation re-affirmed the importance of art in assisting the devotions of the faithful, and encouraged the production of new images of or including Jesus in enormous numbers, also continuing to use the standard depiction.

During the 17th century, some writers, such as Thomas Browne in his Pseudodoxia Epidemica criticized depictions of Jesus with long hair. Although some scholars believed that Jesus wore long hair because he was a Nazarite and therefore could not cut his hair, Browne argues &quot;that our Saviour was a Nazarite after this kind, we have no reason to determine; for he drank Wine, and was therefore called by the Pharisees, a Wine-bibber; he approached also the dead, as when he raised from death Lazarus, and the daughter of Jairus.”

By the end of the 19th century, new reports of miraculous images of Jesus had appeared and continue to receive significant attention, e.g. Secondo Pia&#x27;s 1898 photograph of the Shroud of Turin, one of the most controversial artifacts in history, which during its May 2010 exposition it was visited by over 2 million people. Another 20th-century depiction of Jesus, namely the Divine Mercy image based on Faustina Kowalska&#x27;s reported vision has over 100 million followers. The first cinematic portrayal of Jesus was in the 1897 film &quot;La Passion du Christ&quot; produced in Paris, which lasted 5 minutes. Thereafter cinematic portrayals have continued to show Jesus with a beard in the standard western depiction that resembles traditional images.

A scene from the documentary film &quot;Super Size Me&quot; showed American children being unable to identify a common depiction of Jesus, despite recognizing other figures like George Washington and Ronald McDonald.

== Conventional depictions ==
Conventional depictions of Christ developed in medieval art include the narrative scenes of the Life of Christ, and many other conventional depictions:

Common narrative scenes from the Life of Christ in art include:
* Nativity of Jesus in art
* Adoration of the Shepherds
* Adoration of the Magi
* Finding in the Temple
* Baptism of Jesus
* Crucifixion of Jesus
* Descent from the Cross
* Last Judgement
Devotional images include:
* Madonna and child
* Christ in Majesty
* Christ Pantokrator
* Sacred Heart
* Pietà (mother and dead son)
* Lamb of God
* Man of sorrows
* Pensive Christ

== Range of depictions ==
Certain local traditions have maintained different depictions, sometimes reflecting local racial characteristics, as do the Catholic and Orthodox depictions. The Coptic Church of Egypt separated in the 5th century, and has a distinctive depiction of Jesus, consistent with Coptic art. The Ethiopian Church, also Coptic, developed on Coptic traditions, but shows Jesus and all Biblical figures with the Ethiopian appearance of its members. Other traditions in China, Central Asia and elsewhere generally depict the appearance of Jesus as that of the local population (see the gallery below).

In modern times such variation has become more common, but images following the traditional depiction in both physical appearance and clothing are still dominant, perhaps surprisingly so. In Europe, local ethnic tendencies in depictions of Jesus can be seen, for example in Spanish, German, or Early Netherlandish painting, but almost always surrounding figures are still more strongly characterised. For example, the Virgin Mary, after the vision reported by Bridget of Sweden, was often shown with blonde hair, but Christ&#x27;s is very rarely paler than a light brown.

Some medieval Western depictions, usually of the Meeting at Emmaus, where his disciples do not recognise him at first (Luke.24.13–32), showed Jesus wearing a Jewish hat.
In 2001, the television series &quot;Son of God&quot; used one of three first-century Jewish skulls from a leading department of forensic science in Israel to depict Jesus in a new way. A face was constructed using forensic anthropology by Richard Neave, a retired medical artist from the Unit of Art in Medicine at the University of Manchester. The face that Neave constructed suggested that Jesus would have had a broad face and large nose, and differed significantly from the traditional depictions of Jesus in renaissance art. Additional information about Jesus&#x27; skin color and hair was provided by Mark Goodacre, a New Testament scholar and professor at Duke University.

Using third-century images from a synagogue—the earliest pictures of Jewish people—Goodacre proposed that Jesus&#x27; skin color would have been darker and swarthier than his traditional Western image. He also suggested that he would have had short, curly hair and a short cropped beard. Although entirely speculative as the face of Jesus, the result of the study determined that Jesus&#x27; skin would have been more olive-colored than white or black, and that he would have looked like a typical Galilean Semite. Among the points made was that the Bible records that Jesus&#x27;s disciple Judas had to point him out to those arresting him in Gethsemane. The implied argument is that if Jesus&#x27;s physical appearance had differed markedly from his disciples, then he would have been relatively easy to identify.

== Miraculous images of Jesus ==
There are, however, some images which have been claimed to realistically show how Jesus looked. One early tradition, recorded by Eusebius of Caesarea, says that Jesus once washed his face with water and then dried it with a cloth, leaving an image of his face imprinted on the cloth. This was sent by him to King Abgarus of Edessa, who had sent a messenger asking Jesus to come and heal him of his disease. This image, called the &quot;Mandylion&quot; or Image of Edessa, appears in history in around 525. Numerous replicas of this &quot;image not made by human hands&quot; remain in circulation. There are also icon compositions of Jesus and Mary that are traditionally believed by many Orthodox to have originated in paintings by Luke the Evangelist.

A currently familiar depiction is that on the Shroud of Turin, whose records go back to 1353. Controversy surrounds the shroud and its exact origin remains subject to debate. The Shroud of Turin is respected by Christians of several traditions, including Baptists, Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Orthodox, Pentecostals, and Presbyterians. It is one of the Catholic devotions approved by the Holy See, that to the Holy Face of Jesus, now uses the image of the face on the shroud as it appeared in the negative of the photograph taken by amateur photographer Secondo Pia in 1898. The image cannot be clearly seen on the shroud itself with the naked eye, and it surprised Pia to the extent that he said he almost dropped and broke the photographic plate when he first saw the developed negative image on it in the evening of 28 May 1898.

Before 1898, devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus used an image based on the Veil of Veronica, where legend recounts that Veronica from Jerusalem encountered Jesus along the Via Dolorosa on the way to Calvary. When she paused to wipe the sweat from Jesus&#x27;s face with her veil, the image was imprinted on the cloth. The establishment of these images as Catholic devotions traces back to Sister Marie of St Peter and the Venerable Leo Dupont who started and promoted them from 1844 to 1874 in Tours France, and Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli who associated the image from the Shroud of Turin with the devotion in 1936 in Milan Italy.
A very popular 20th-century depiction among Roman Catholics and Anglicans is the Divine Mercy image, which was approved by Pope John Paul II in April 2000. The Divine Mercy depiction is formally used in celebrations of Divine Mercy Sunday and is venerated by over 100 million Catholics who follow the devotion. The image is not part of Acheiropoieta in that it has been depicted by modern artists, but the pattern of the image is said to have been miraculously shown to Saint Faustina Kowalska in a vision of Jesus in 1931 in Płock, Poland.

Faustina wrote in her diary that Jesus appeared to her and asked her to &quot;Paint an image according to the pattern you see&quot;. Faustina eventually found an artist (Eugene Kazimierowski) to depict the Divine Mercy image of Jesus with his right hand raised in a sign of blessing and the left hand touching the garment near his breast, with two large rays, one red, the other white emanating from near his heart. After Faustina&#x27;s death, a number of other artists painted the image, with the depiction by Adolf Hyla being among the most reproduced.

Warner Sallman stated that &quot;The Head of Christ&quot; was the result of a &quot;miraculous vision that he received late one night&quot;, proclaiming that &quot;the answer came at 2 A.M., January 1924&quot; as &quot;a vision in response to my prayer to God in a despairing situation.&quot; The &quot;Head of Christ&quot; is venerated in the Coptic Orthodox Church, after twelve-year-old Isaac Ayoub, who diagnosed with cancer, saw the eyes of Jesus in the painting shedding tears; Fr. Ishaq Soliman of St. Mark&#x27;s Coptic Church in Houston, on the same day, &quot;testified to the miracles&quot; and on the next day, &quot;Dr. Atef Rizkalla, the family physician, examined the youth and certified that there were no traces of leukemia&quot;.

With episcopal approval from Bishop Tadros of Port Said and Bishop Yuhanna of Cairo, &quot;Sallman&#x27;s &quot;Head of Christ&quot; was exhibited in the Coptic Church&quot;, with &quot;more than fifty thousand people&quot; visiting the church to see it. In addition, several religious magazines have explained the &quot;power of Sallman&#x27;s picture&quot; by documenting occurrences such as headhunters letting go of a businessman and fleeing after seeing the image, a &quot;thief who aborted his misdeed when he saw the &quot;Head of Christ&quot; on a living room wall&quot;, and deathbed conversions of non-believers to Christianity. As an extraordinarily successful work of Christian popular devotional art, it had been reproduced over half a billion times worldwide by the end of the 20th century.

<text>Brigadier Ralph Alger Bagnold, OBE, FRS, (3 April 1896 – 28 May 1990) was an English 20th-century desert explorer, geologist and soldier.

Bagnold served in the First World War as an engineer in the British Army.

In 1932, he staged the first recorded East-to-West crossing of the Libyan Desert. His work in the field of Aeolian processes was the basis for the book &quot;The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes&quot;, establishing the discipline of aeolian geomorphology, combining field work observations, experiments and physical equations. His work has been used by United States&#x27; space agency NASA in its study of the terrain of the planet Mars, the Bagnold Dunes on Mars&#x27; surface were named after him by the organisation.

He returned to the forces in the Second World War, in which he founded the behind-the-lines reconnaissance, espionage and raiding unit the &quot;Long Range Desert Group&quot;, serving as its first commanding officer in the North Africa campaign.

==Early life==

Bagnold was born in Devonport, England. His father, Colonel Arthur Henry Bagnold (1854–1943) (Royal Engineers), participated in the rescue expedition of 1884–85 to rescue General Gordon in Khartoum, Sudan. His sister was the novelist and playwright Enid Bagnold, who wrote the 1935 novel &quot;National Velvet&quot;.

After Malvern College, he attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. In 1915, Ralph Bagnold followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and was commissioned into the Royal Engineers, after having graduated from the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.
He spent three years in the trenches in France, being mentioned in despatches in 1917 and receiving the Belgian Order of Leopold in 1919.

After the war Bagnold studied engineering at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, obtaining an MA before returning to active duty with the British Army in 1920 with the Royal Corps of Signals. He served in Cairo and the North West Frontier, India, where he was again mentioned in dispatches. In both of these locations, he spent much of his leave exploring the local deserts. After having read Ahmed Hassanein&#x27;s &quot;Lost Oasis&quot; he spent one such expedition in 1929 using a Ford Model A automobile and two Ford lorries exploring the vast swathe of desert from Cairo to Ain Dalla which was an area reputed to contain the mythical city of Zerzura. After a brief period of half-pay, he left the Army in 1935, but rejoined upon the outbreak of the Second World War.

==Desert exploration==

Bagnold and his travelling companions were early pioneers in the use of motor vehicles to explore the desert. In 1932 Bagnold explored the Mourdi Depression, in present-day Chad, and found implements dated to the Palaeolithic period in the valley. Bagnold wrote of his travels in the book &quot;Libyan Sands: Travel in a Dead World&quot; (first published 1935; reprinted by Eland in 2010). He is credited with developing a sun compass, which is not affected by magnetic iron ore deposits or by metal vehicles as a magnetic compass might be. During the 1930s his group also began the practice of reducing tyre pressure when driving over loose sand.

In addition Bagnold is credited with devising a method of driving over the large sand dunes found in the &quot;sand seas&quot; of the Libyan Desert. He wrote, &quot;I increased speed. ... A huge glaring wall of yellow shot up high into the sky. The lorry tipped violently backwards—and we rose as in a lift, smoothly without vibration. We floated up on a yellow cloud. All the accustomed car movements had ceased; only the speedometer told us we were still moving fast. It was incredible ...&quot; However, noted Fitzroy Maclean, &quot;too much dash had its penalties. Many of the dunes fell away sharply at the far side and if you arrived at the top at full speed, you were likely to plunge headlong over the precipice. ... and end up with your truck upside down on top of you.&quot;

A recently discovered silent film documents Bagnold&#x27;s explorations and is available via the British Film Institute.

==Second World War==

Bagnold wrote, &quot;Never in our peacetime travels had we imagined that war could ever reach the enormous empty solitudes of the inner desert, walled off by sheer distance, lack of water, and impassable seas of sand dunes. Little did we dream that any of the special equipment and techniques we had evolved for very long-distance travel, and for navigation, would ever be put to serious use.&quot;

On 10 June 1940 Italy declared war on the United Kingdom in alliance with Germany while Bagnold was in Cairo due to an accident involving a troopship collision that he was on interrupting his journey elsewhere. Upon hearing the news and realizing that North Africa was about to become a theatre of war, he requested an interview with General Archibald Wavell, Commander-in-Chief Middle East. Having secured it, Bagnold suggested that Wavell use his knowledge of the terrain in North Africa to establish a mobile scouting force for desert operations against the Italian Armed Forces in Libya, which Wavell was charged with defeating in the field. During the conversation Wavell asked Bagnold what he would do if he found that the Italians were not doing anything beyond the Libyan coast in the desert interior. Bagnold replied that the new unit that he had in mind might be able to commit &quot;acts of piracy&quot;. Wavell granted Bagnold authority to form a unit along these lines, with it being constituted in July 1940 with the name Long Range Desert Group (L.R.D.G.). After assembling its first formation, Bagnold was the L.R.D.G.&#x27;s commanding officer until August 1941, when he handed over command to Guy Prendergast on being promoted to the post of Inspector of Desert Troops. 

In October 1941 he was promoted to the post of Deputy Signal Officer-in-Chief Middle East, with the temporary rank of Brigadier and worked on camouflage and deception operations. He left after six months in March 1942, visiting Gaza, Brummana and Jerusalem (October 1942), Sudan and Eritrea (December 1942) and Turkey (May 1943 and August 1943) before returning to England in March 1944.

On 7 June 1944 Bagnold retired from the British Army with the end of military operations in North Africa after the Axis powers&#x27; defeat in that theatre. and returned to his scientific interests, being elected to a Fellowship of the Royal Society in the same year.

==Later work==

After the war Bagnold continued to work in the field of the geological science, and he published academic papers into his nineties. He made significant contributions to the understanding of desert terrain such as sand dunes, ripples and sheets. He developed the dimensionless &quot;Bagnold number&quot; and &quot;Bagnold formula&quot; for characterising sand flow. He gave a constitutive relation for a suspension of neutrally buoyant particles in a Newtonian fluid. He also proposed a model for &quot;singing sands&quot;. and made contributions to the science of Sedimentology. His work received a number of awards. He was the 1969 recipient of the G. K. Warren Prize from the National Academy of Sciences. In 1971 he received the Wollaston Medal, the highest award granted by the Geological Society of London, and in 1981 the David Linton Award of the British Geomorphological Research Group. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974. Other awards included the 1970 Penrose Medal by the Geological Society of America; and the Sorby Medal from the International Association of Sedimentologists. He also received honorary D.Sc. degrees from both the University of East Anglia and the Danish University of Aarhus.

==Death==

In his final years, Bagnold lived in Edenbridge in the county of Kent in England. He died at Hither Green on 28 May 1990 at the age of 94.

==Personal life==

Bagnold married Dorothy on 8 May 1946 at Rottingdean in East Sussex, and had a son and a daughter.

<text>Emeric Pressburger (born Imre József Pressburger; 5 December 19025 February 1988) was a Hungarian-British screenwriter, film director, and producer. He is best known for his series of film collaborations with Michael Powell, in a collaboration partnership known as the Archers, and produced a series of films, including &quot;49th Parallel&quot; (US: &quot;The Invaders&quot;, 1941), &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943), &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (US: &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, 1946), &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; (1947), &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948), and &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; (1951).

== Early years ==
Imre József Pressburger was born in Miskolc, in the Kingdom of Hungary, of Jewish heritage. He was the only son (he had one elder half-sister from his father&#x27;s previous marriage) of Kálmán Pressburger, estate manager, and his second wife, Kätherina (née Wichs). He attended a boarding-school in Temesvár (today better known as Timișoara), where he was a good pupil, excelling at mathematics, literature and music. He then studied mathematics and engineering at the Universities of Prague and Stuttgart before his father&#x27;s death forced him to abandon his studies.

== Film career ==
=== Berlin and Paris ===
Pressburger began a career as a journalist. After working in Hungary and Weimar Republic-era Germany he turned to screenwriting in the late 1920s, working for UFA in Berlin (having moved there in 1926). The rise of the Nazis forced him to flee to Paris, where he again worked as screenwriter, and then to London. He later said, &quot;[the] worst things that happened to me were the political consequences of events beyond my control ... the best things were exactly the same.&quot;

Pressburger&#x27;s early films were mainly made in Germany and France where he worked at the UFA Studios in the Dramaturgie department (script selection, approval and editing) and as a scriptwriter in his own right. In the 1930s, many European films were produced in multiple-language versions. Some of the films made in Germany survive with French intertitles and vice versa.

In 1933, after the Nazis came to power, UFA&#x27;s head sacked the company&#x27;s remaining Jewish employees with Pressburger being told his contract would not be renewed. He left his Berlin apartment, &quot;leaving the key in the door so that the Stormtroopers wouldn&#x27;t have to break the door down&quot; and left for Paris. Late in 1935, Pressburger decided that he would do better in England.

=== Emigration to the United Kingdom ===
Pressburger arrived in Britain in 1935 as a stateless person; once he decided to settle, he changed his name to Emeric in 1938. In England, he found a small community of Hungarian film-makers who had fled the Nazis, including Alexander Korda, owner of London Films, who employed him as a screenwriter. Asked by Korda to improve the script for &quot;The Spy in Black&quot; (1939), he met the film&#x27;s director, Michael Powell. Their partnership would produce some of the most acclaimed British films of the next decade. However, Pressburger still did some projects on his own.

Pressburger was much more than &quot;Michael Powell&#x27;s screenwriter&quot; as some have categorised him. The films they made together in this period were mainly original stories by Pressburger, who also did most of the work of a producer for the team. Pressburger was also more involved in the editing process than Powell, and as a musician, Pressburger was also involved in the choice of music for their films.

=== Later work ===
Powell and Pressburger began to go their separate ways after the mid-1950s. They remained close friends but wanted to explore different things, having done about as much as they could together. Two of his later films were made under the pseudonym &quot;Richard Imrie&quot;.

Two novels by Pressburger were published. The first &quot;Killing a Mouse on a Sunday&quot; (1961), is set in the period immediately following the Spanish Civil War. It received favourable reviews and was soon translated into a dozen languages. &quot;The Glass Pearls&quot; (1966), reissued in 2015 and again in 2022 by Faber, gained an especially negative assessment from &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, its only contemporary review.

Subsequently it has been highly praised. Lucy Scholes in &quot;The Paris Review&quot; in 2019 called it &quot;a truly remarkable work. It deserves to be recognized both for its own virtuosity, and as an important addition to the genre of Holocaust literature.&quot;

== Personal life ==
On 24 June 1938, Pressburger married Ági Donáth, the daughter of Andor Donáth, a general merchant, but they divorced in 1941. The union was childless. He remarried, on 29 March 1947, to Wendy Orme, and they had a daughter, Angela, and another child who died as a baby in 1948; but this marriage also ended in divorce in Reno, Nevada in 1953 and in Britain in 1971. His daughter Angela&#x27;s two sons both became successful film-makers: Andrew Macdonald as a producer on films such as &quot;Trainspotting&quot; (1996), and Kevin Macdonald as an Oscar-winning director. Kevin has written a biography of his grandfather, and a documentary about his life, &quot;The Making of an Englishman&quot; (1995).

Pressburger became a British citizen in 1946. He was made a Fellow of BAFTA in 1981, and a Fellow of the BFI in 1983.

Pressburger was a diffident and private person who, at times, particularly later on in his life, could be hypersensitive and prone to bouts of melancholia. He loved French cuisine, enjoyed music, and possessed a great sense of humour. In appearance he was short, wore glasses, and had a sagacious, bird-like facial expression. He was a keen supporter of Arsenal F.C., a passion he developed soon after arriving in Britain. From 1970 he lived in Aspall, Suffolk and he died in a nursing home in nearby Saxtead on 5 February 1988, due to the complications of old age and pneumonia. He is interred in the cemetery of St. Mary of Grace Church, Aspall. His is the only grave in that Church of England graveyard with a Star of David.

<doc id="202637" wikidata="Q7757008" url="?curid=202637" title="The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes">
<text>The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes is a scientific book written by Ralph A. Bagnold. The book laid the foundations of the scientific investigation of the transport of sand by wind. It also discusses the formation and movement of sand dunes in the Libyan Desert. During his expeditions into the Libyan Desert, Bagnold had been fascinated by the shapes of the sand dunes, and after returning to England he built a wind tunnel and conducted the experiments which are the basis of the book. 

Bagnold finished writing the book in 1939, and it was first published on 26 June 1941. A reprinted version, with minor revisions by Bagnold, was published by Chapman and Hall in 1953, and reprinted again in 1971. The book was reissued by Dover Publications in 2005.

The book explores the movement of sand in desert environments, with a particular emphasis on how wind affects the formation and movement of dunes and ripples. Bagnold&#x27;s interest in this subject was spurred by his extensive desert expeditions, during which he observed various sand storms. One pivotal observation was that the movement of sand, unlike that of dust, predominantly occurs near the ground, within a height of one metre, and was less influenced by large-scale eddy currents in the air.

The book emphasises the feasibility of replicating these natural phenomena under controlled conditions in a laboratory. By using a wind tunnel, Bagnold sought to gain a deeper understanding of the physics governing the interaction between airstreams and sand grains, and vice versa. His aim was to ensure that findings from controlled experiments mirrored real-world conditions, with verifications of these laboratory results conducted through field observations in the Libyan Desert in the late 1930s.

Bagnold delineates his research into two distinct stages. The first, which constitutes the primary focus of the book, investigates the dynamics of sand movement across mostly flat terrains. This includes understanding how sand is lifted, transported, and accumulated on a plane surface. Bagnold&#x27;s wind tunnel experiments from the mid-1930s form the core of his analysis, though the book also dedicates chapters to the morphology of naturally occurring sand formations.

The second stage, which Bagnold indicates is yet to be fully explored, delves into aeolian transport and the aerodynamics of airstreams as they navigate the curved surfaces of sand accumulations, hinting at the complexities of studying such natural systems. Apart from examining sand and its dynamics in the context of wind, Bagnold also makes comparisons between sand and dry granular snow, noting the parallels in their movement. Differences and similarities between sand movement in air versus water are also highlighted.

Acknowledging the pioneering nature of his work, Bagnold expressed an awareness of the potential limitations and omissions in his study. He also emphasised the balance he attempted to strike between providing a rigorous scientific treatment, incorporating mathematical models and diagrams, while ensuring the content remained accessible to experts across diverse fields, from hydraulic engineering, to geophysics and geomorphology.

The book is still a main reference in the field, and was used by NASA for studying sand dunes and the development of sand-driving mechanisms on Mars.

<text>National Taiwan University (NTU; ) is a national public research university in Taipei, Taiwan. 

The university was founded in 1928 during Japanese rule as the seventh of the Imperial Universities. It was named Taihoku Imperial University () and served during the period of Japanese colonization. After World War II, the Nationalist government assumed the administration of the university. The Ministry of Education reorganized and renamed the university to its current name on November 15, 1945, with its roots of liberal tradition from Peking University in Beijing by former NTU President Fu Ssu-nien. 

The university consists of 11 colleges, 56 departments, 133 graduate institutes, about 60 research centers, and a school of professional education and continuing studies.

NTU alumni include many presidents of Taiwan, as well as Turing Award laureate Andrew Yao, and Nobel Prize in Chemistry laureate Yuan T. Lee. NTU is affiliated with National Taiwan Normal University and National Taiwan University of Science and Technology as part of the NTU System.

== History ==
=== Imperial University ===
National Taiwan University has its origins as the Taihoku Imperial University (; ), founded in 1928 during Japanese rule as a member of the imperial university system administered by the Empire of Japan.

The school&#x27;s first president was . Taihoku Imperial University began with the faculty of Liberal Arts and Law and the Faculty of Science and Agriculture serving 60 students. The university was intended mainly for Japanese nationals; few Taiwanese students were admitted. The Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Engineering were added in 1935 and 1943, respectively.

=== National University ===

After World War II, the then-Chinese National government (the now-called Republic of China (Taiwan)) reorganized the school as an institution for Chinese-speaking students. The school was renamed &quot;National Taiwan University&quot; on November 15, 1945, and Lo Tsung-lo was appointed as its president. The Literature and Politics division was divided into the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Law. Additionally, colleges of Science, Medicine, Engineering, and Agriculture were established. Initially, there were six colleges with 22 departments. In 1945, student enrollment was 585.

In 1960, the night school was initiated on a trial basis, and in 1967 a new night school was established. In 1987, the College of Management was established, followed by the College of Public Health in 1993 and the College of Electrical Engineering in 1997. The College of Electrical Engineering was later reorganized as the College of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. In 1999, the College of Law has renamed the College of Social Sciences, and the Night Division and the Center for Continuing Education were combined to form the School for Professional and Continuing Studies. In 2002, the College of Agriculture has renamed the College of Bio-resources and Agriculture, and in 2002 a College of Life Sciences was added.

NTU selected as the national seven universities in research in 2002 (currently merged into six universities).

==== Kuan Chung-ming controversy ====

Kuan Chung-ming, an economist who previously served in the Ma Administration, was named university president-elect in January 2018 but soon became embroiled in allegations related to plagiarism, academic misconduct, and violations of civil code which stipulated that Taiwanese public servants were not permitted to deliver lectures or to be involved in any mainland China-related academic activities due to national security concerns. During the election and the subsequent investigation, Tei-Wei Kuo served as the interim president of the university while the president-elect underwent multiple legal investigations from the ruling DPP government. Though Kuan was eventually cleared of all accusations and officially named as the university president in January 2019 (see ), this prolonged investigation raised suspicion regarding the intervention from the ruling DPP government. Three Ministers of Education stepped down as a result of this event.

== Campuses ==
NTU has a main campus in Daan District, Taipei City and has additional campuses in Taipei, New Taipei City, Hsinchu County, Yunlin County, and Nantou County. The main campus is home to most college department buildings and administrative buildings. The university governs farms, forests, and hospitals for education and research purposes. The total area of NTU exceeds 340 square kilometers (34,000 hectares), accounting for one percent of Taiwan&#x27;s total land area.

The five campuses are:
*Main Campus (113 hectares, located in Daan District, Taipei)
*Shuiyuan Campus (7.7 hectares, located in Zhongzheng District, Taipei)
*College of Medicine Campus (located in Zhongzheng District)
*Yunlin Campus (54 hectares, located in Yunlin County)
*Zhubei Campus (22 hectares, located in Hsinchu County)

=== Other university property ===
*Visiting professor residences (34 hectares, located on Yangmingshan, Taipei)
*University Farm (19.5 hectares, located in Xindian District, New Taipei City)
*Wenshan Botanical Garden (5 hectares, located in Shiding District, New Taipei City)
*Highland Experimental Farm (1,019 hectares, located in Nantou County)
*Experimental Forest Office (25.9 hectares, located in Nantou County)
*Experimental Forest (33,310 hectares, located in Nantou County)

== Academics ==
The university comprises 11 colleges: Liberal Arts, Engineering, Science, Social Sciences, Law, Bio-Resources &amp; Agriculture, Management, Public Health, Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science, Medicine, and Life Science. NTU offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees, master&#x27;s degrees, and doctorate degrees in many disciplines.

NTU requires most of its undergraduate students to take a mandatory core curriculum, comprising Chinese, freshman English, physical education, and public service. The medical school in addition dictates each of its students to take philosophy and sociology classes as well as seminars in ethics and thanatology. Military training is no longer an obligatory course for male students, but it is a prerequisite if they plan to apply to become officers during their compulsory military service.

NTU&#x27;s programs cover a wide array of disciplines across science, arts, and the humanities, with up to 8,000 courses made available for selection each semester. Students are able to select courses offered by any of the colleges; however, compulsory subjects designated for each major needs to be completed to be awarded a degree. A student must declare a major during college application, some majors are more competitive than others and require a higher national examination score. In recent years, medicine, electrical engineering, law, and finance have been the most selective majors. Most majors take four years to complete while both the dental and the medical degrees take six years to finish.

The International Chinese Language Program (ICLP), founded by Stanford University, is located at National Taiwan University.

NTU is a member of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities, Washington University in St. Louis&#x27;s McDonnell International Scholars Academy, and the Association of East Asian Research Universities.

NTU also participates in several programs of the Taiwan International Graduate Program of Academia Sinica, Taiwan&#x27;s most preeminent academic research institution.

In 2021, the &quot;International College&quot; was established, primarily enrolling international students of foreign nationality and offering courses entirely in English.

=== Chung Wai Literary Quarterly ===
Chung Wai Literary Quarterly () is a quarterly Taiwanese peer-reviewed scholarly journal published by the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures, National Taiwan University, featuring fiction, academic articles, reviews, translations, and non-fiction essays related to Western literature. Originally founded as a monthly literary magazine by and Chu Limin in 1972 and named Chung Wai Literary Monthly, the journal aims to encourage and promote critical and emerging approaches to non-local literatures and connect literature with other academic disciplines. In 2007, the journal renamed and restructured as a quarterly and in 2019, the journal was recognized as a Grade I academic journal by the National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan.

<text>Stefan Wolpe (25 August 1902, Berlin – 4 April 1972, New York City) was a German-born American composer. He was associated with interdisciplinary modernism, with affiliations ranging from the Bauhaus, Berlin agitprop theater and the kibbutz movement to the Eighth Street Artists&#x27; Club, Black Mountain College, and the Darmstadt Summer Courses for New Music. He lived and worked in Berlin (1902–1933) until the Nazi seizure of power forced him to move first to Vienna (1933–34) and Jerusalem (1934–38) before settling in New York City (1938–72). In works such as &quot;Battle Piece&quot; (1942/1947) and &quot;In a State of Flight&quot; in &quot;Enactments for Three Pianos&quot; (1953), he responded self-consciously to the circumstances of his uprooted life, a theme he also explored extensively in voluminous diaries, correspondence, and lectures. His densely eclectic music absorbed ideas and idioms from diverse artistic milieus, including post-tonality, bebop, and Arab classical musics.

==Life==
Wolpe was born in Berlin to Jewish parents. He attended the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory from the age of fourteen, and for one semester the State Academic College of Music in Berlin (currently: Berlin University of the Arts). He studied composition under Franz Schreker and was also a pupil of Ferruccio Busoni. He also studied at the Bauhaus circa 1923, and met some of the dadaists, setting Kurt Schwitters&#x27;s poem &quot;An Anna Blume&quot; to music.

In 1928, Wolpe&#x27;s first opera, &quot;Zeus und Elida&quot;, premiered in Berlin. This soon was followed by two more operas in 1929, &quot;Schöne Geschichten&quot; and &quot;Anna Blume&quot;. In 1927, he married the artist Ola Okuniewska from Czechoslovakia and their daughter, Katharina Wolpe was born in 1931 but the couple had separated. His wife escaped to London in 1938, but his daughter was a de facto orphan in Berne during the war.

The music Wolpe was writing between 1929 and 1933 was dissonant, using Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique. However, possibly influenced by Paul Hindemith&#x27;s concept of Gebrauchsmusik (music that serves a social function), and as an avid socialist, he wrote a number of pieces for workers&#x27; unions and communist theatre groups. For these, he made his style more accessible, incorporating elements of jazz and popular music.

When the Nazis came to power in Germany, Wolpe, a Jew and a communist, fled the country, first to his sister in Czechoslovakia, and then to Zurich. After a brief visit to the Soviet Union, Wolpfe continued for a shot stay in Vienna to in 1933, where he met and studied with Anton Webern. With his partner, Irma Schoenberg he then moved to Romania and shortly afterwards to Palestine, where he wrote simple songs for the kibbutzim, and sought to create an amalgam of Western, Mizarhi and Arab influences. The music he was writing for concert performance, however, remained complex and atonal. Partly because of this, his teaching contract with the Palestine Conservatoire was not renewed for the 1938–39 school year.

In 1938, Wolpe moved to New York City. In 1945 he became an American citizen and started teaching at the Brooklyn School of Music. He briefly met his daughter in London in 1946. There, during the fifties, he associated with the abstract expressionist painters. He was introduced to them by his third wife, the poet Hilda Morley. From 1952 to 1956 he was director of music at Black Mountain College. Some of his most important compositions were written here, including “Symphony for Twenty Four Instruments” and “Enactments for Three Pianos”. 

In 1956, he was appointed to the faculty at the C.W. Post College of Long Island University in Brookville, New York. He also lectured at the summer schools in Darmstadt in Germany. His pupils included Jack Behrens, Herbert Brün, Morton Feldman, David Tudor, Matthew Greenbaum, John Carisi, M. William Karlins, Gil Evans, George Russell, Robert D. Levin, Boyd McDonald, Ralph Shapey, Ursula Mamlok, Netty Simons, and Beatrice Witkin.

His works from this time sometimes used the twelve-tone technique, were sometimes diatonic, were sometimes based on the Arabic scales (such as &quot;maqam saba&quot;) he had heard in Palestine and sometimes employed some other method of tonal organisation.

In 1971, Wolpe completed his last composition, &quot;Piece for Trumpet and Seven Instruments&quot; for the trumpeter Ronald Anderson. Wolpe developed Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 1964, and died in New York City in 1972.

== Music ==
Elliott Carter said of Wolpe&#x27;s music that, &quot;he does everything wrong and it comes out right.&quot;

<text>Liberation is an album by the Jamaican musician Bunny Wailer, released in 1989 through Shanachie Records. Wailer supported the album with a North American tour. It was nominated for a Grammy Award, in the &quot;Best Reggae Recording&quot; category.

==Production==
&quot;Botha the Mosquito&quot; is about South African president P. W. Botha. Wailer included a reproduction of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the album notes.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Wailer seems snake-bitten here—the better melodies deliver lyrics that aren&#x27;t particularly fresh, and the stronger themes are coupled with lackluster hooks that don&#x27;t cut through the production problems.&quot; &quot;The Gazette&quot; called the album &quot;roots reggae par excellence.&quot;

==Track listing==

<text>Agnes Robertson Moorehead (December 6, 1900April 30, 1974) was an American actress. In a career spanning five decades, her credits included work in radio, stage, film, and television. Moorehead was the recipient of such accolades as a Primetime Emmy Award and two Golden Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for four Academy Awards.

Moorehead had joined Orson Welles&#x27; Mercury Players, as one of his principal performers in 1937. She also had notable roles in films such as &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941), &quot;Dark Passage&quot; (1947), &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1951), and &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; (1955). Moorehead garnered four nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, for her performances in: &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942), &quot;Mrs. Parkington&quot; (1944), &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; (1948), and &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot; (1964). She is also known for the radioplay &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot; (1943).

She gained acclaim for her role as Endora on the ABC sitcom &quot;Bewitched&quot; which she played from 1964 to 1972. Her performance earned her six nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. For her role on the western series &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.

==Early life==
Agnes Robertson Moorehead was born on December 6, 1900, in Clinton, Massachusetts, the daughter of former singer Mary (&quot;née&quot; McCauley), who was 17 when she was born, and Presbyterian clergyman John Henderson Moorehead. Moorehead later claimed that she was born in 1906 to appear younger for acting parts. She recalled that she made her first public performance at the age of three, when she recited the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in her father&#x27;s church. The family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and her ambition to become an actress grew &quot;very strong&quot;. Her mother indulged her active imagination, often asking, &quot;Who are you today, Agnes?&quot; while Moorehead and her younger sister Peggy (born Margaret Ann) engaged in mimicry. This involved coming to the dinner table and imitating their father&#x27;s parishioners; they were further encouraged by his amused reactions.

As a young woman, Moorehead joined the chorus of the St. Louis Municipal Opera Company, known as &quot;The Muny&quot;. In addition to her interest in acting, she developed a lifelong interest in religion; in later years, actors such as Dick Sargent recalled Moorehead&#x27;s arriving on the set with &quot;the Bible in one hand and the script in the other&quot;.

Moorehead earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1923, majoring in biology at Muskingum College in New Concord, Ohio. While there, she also appeared in college stage plays. She received an honorary doctorate in literature from Muskingum in 1947, and served for a year on its board of trustees. When her family moved to Reedsburg, Wisconsin, she taught public school for five years in Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin, while she also earned a master&#x27;s degree in English and public speaking at the University of Wisconsin (now the University of Wisconsin-Madison). She then pursued postgraduate studies at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, from which she graduated with honors in 1929. Moorehead also received an honorary doctoral degree from Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois.

==Career==

Moorehead&#x27;s early acting career was unsteady, and although she was able to find stage work, she was often unemployed. She later recalled going four days without food, and said that it had taught her &quot;the value of a dollar&quot;. She found work in radio and was soon in demand, often working on several programs in a single day. She believed that it offered her excellent training and allowed her to develop her voice to create a variety of characterizations. Moorehead met actress Helen Hayes, who encouraged her to enter films, but her first attempts were met with failure. When she was rejected as not being &quot;the right type&quot;, Moorehead returned to radio.

===Mercury Theatre===

By 1937, Moorehead had joined Orson Welles&#x27; Mercury Players, as one of his principal performers along with Joseph Cotten. (In an appearance on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; on February 19, 1973, she revealed that, in 1922, she had by chance met Welles (15 years her junior) when he was a mere seven years old at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.) She performed in his &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; radio adaptations, and had a regular role opposite Welles in the serial &quot;The Shadow&quot; as Margo Lane. In 1939, Welles moved the Mercury Theatre to Hollywood, where he started working for RKO Pictures. Several of his radio performers joined him, and Moorehead made her film debut as the mother of his own character, Charles Foster Kane, in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941), considered by most film critics one of the best films ever made. Moorehead was featured in Welles&#x27; second film, &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942), and received the New York Film Critics Award and an Academy Award nomination for her performance. She also appeared in &quot;Journey Into Fear&quot; (1943), a Mercury film production.

Moorehead received positive reviews for her performance in &quot;Mrs. Parkington&quot; (1944), and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award nomination. Moorehead played another strong role in &quot;The Big Street&quot; (1942) with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball, and then appeared in two films that failed to find an audience, &quot;Government Girl&quot; (1943) with Olivia de Havilland and &quot;The Youngest Profession&quot; (1944) with adolescent Virginia Weidler.

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===

By the mid-1940s, Moorehead became a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract player, negotiating a $6,000-a-week contract, which also allowed her to perform on radio, an unusual clause at the time. Moorehead explained that MGM usually refused to allow their actors to appear on radio, as &quot;the actors didn&#x27;t have the knowledge or the taste or the judgment to appear on the right sort of show.&quot; In 1943–1944, Moorehead portrayed &quot;matronly housekeeper Mrs. Mullet&quot;, who was constantly offering her &quot;candied opinion&quot;, in the Mutual Broadcasting System&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Leonidas Witherall&quot;; she inaugurated the role on CBS Radio.

Throughout her career, Moorehead skillfully portrayed puritanical matrons, neurotic spinsters, possessive mothers, and comical secretaries. She had supporting roles in &quot;The Youngest Profession&quot; (1943), &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; (1944), and the crime drama &quot;Dark Passage&quot; (1947), starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. She then played Aggie McDonald in the 1948 film, &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot;. She played Parthy Hawks, wife of Cap&#x27;n Andy and mother of Magnolia, in MGM&#x27;s hit 1951 remake of &quot;Show Boat&quot;. Moorehead was in Broadway productions of &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot; in 1951–1952, and &quot;Lord Pengo&quot; in 1962–1963.

===Radio===
In her first radio role, Moorehead appeared as a replacement for Dorothy Denvir&#x27;s role as Min Gump in &quot;The Gumps&quot;. During the 1940s and 1950s, Moorehead was one of the most in-demand actresses for radio dramas, especially on the CBS show &quot;Suspense&quot;. During the 946-episode run of &quot;Suspense&quot;, Moorehead was cast in more episodes than any other actor or actress. She was often introduced on the show as the &quot;first lady of &quot;Suspense&quot;&quot;. Moorehead&#x27;s most successful appearance on &quot;Suspense&quot; was in the play &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot;, written by Lucille Fletcher, broadcast on May 18, 1943. Moorehead played a selfish, neurotic woman who overhears a murder being plotted via crossed phone wires and eventually realizes she is the intended victim. She recreated the performance six times for &quot;Suspense&quot; and several times on other radio shows, always using her original, dog-eared script. The May 25, 1943 airing was made part of the National Sound Registry by the Library of Congress in 2014. In 1952, she recorded an album of the drama, and performed scenes from the story in her one-woman show in the 1950s. Barbara Stanwyck played the role in the 1948 film version.

In 1941, Moorehead played Maggie in the short-lived &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot; program on the Blue Network. From 1942 to 1949, Moorehead played the role of the mayor&#x27;s housekeeper in the radio version of &quot;Mayor of the Town&quot;. She also starred in &quot;The Amazing Mrs. Danberry&quot;, a situation comedy on CBS in 1946. Moorehead&#x27;s title character was described as &quot;the lively widow of a department store owner who has a tongue as sharp as a hatpin and a heart as warm as summer.&quot; Moorehead played one of her last roles on January 6, 1974, as Mrs. Ada Canby in the ironically titled &quot;The Old Ones Are Hard to Kill&quot;, the inaugural episode of CBS Radio Mystery Theater.

===Films and stage appearances of the 1950s–1960s===
In the 1950s, Moorehead continued to work in films and appeared on stage across the country. Her stage roles included a national tour of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot;, co-starring Charles Boyer, Charles Laughton, and Cedric Hardwicke, and the pre-Broadway engagements of the new musical &quot;The Pink Jungle&quot;. She had a supporting role in the big-budget Howard Hughes film &quot;The Conqueror&quot; (1956), starring John Wayne and Susan Hayward, a film she later regretted appearing in. She starred in &quot;The Bat&quot; (1959) with Vincent Price. She appeared as the hypochondriac Mrs. Snow in Disney&#x27;s hit film &quot;Pollyanna&quot; (1960). She starred with Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland, Mary Astor, and Joseph Cotten in &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot; (1964) as the maid Velma, a role for which she was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award.

===Television===
In 1959, Moorehead guest-starred on many series, including &quot;The Rebel&quot; and &quot;Alcoa Theatre&quot;. Her role in the radio play &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot; inspired writers of the CBS television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; to script an episode with Moorehead in mind. In &quot;The Invaders&quot; (broadcast January 27, 1961), Moorehead played a woman whose isolated farm is plagued by mysterious intruders. Moorehead found the script odd, because it had only one line of dialogue, at the very end. Her character gasped in terror once or twice, but never spoke. In &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot;, Moorehead offered a famed, bravura performance using only her voice.

Moorehead also had guest roles on &quot;Channing&quot;, &quot;Custer&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot; in &quot;Incident at Poco Tiempo&quot; as Sister Frances, and &quot;The Rifleman&quot;. On February 10, 1967, she portrayed Miss Emma Valentine in &quot;The Night of the Vicious Valentine&quot; on &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, a performance for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.

===&quot;Bewitched&quot;===

In 1964, Moorehead accepted the role of Endora, Samantha&#x27;s (Elizabeth Montgomery) mortal-loathing, quick-witted witch mother in the situation comedy &quot;Bewitched&quot;. She later commented that she had not expected it to succeed and that she ultimately felt trapped by its success, but she had negotiated to appear in only eight of every 12 episodes made, thus allowing her sufficient time to pursue other projects. She also felt that the television writing was often below standard and dismissed many of the &quot;Bewitched&quot; scripts as &quot;hack&quot; in a 1965 interview for &quot;TV Guide&quot;. The role brought her a level of recognition that she had not received before as &quot;Bewitched&quot; was in the top-10 programs for the first few years it aired.

Moorehead received six Emmy Award nominations for her work on the series, but was quick to remind interviewers that she had enjoyed a long and distinguished career, commenting to the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; in 1965, &quot;I&#x27;ve been in movies and played theatre from coast to coast, so I was quite well known before &#x27;Bewitched,&#x27; and I don&#x27;t particularly want to be identified as the witch.&quot; Despite her ambivalence, she remained with &quot;Bewitched&quot; until its run ended in 1972. Prior to her death in 1974, she said she had enjoyed playing the role enough, but it was not challenging and the show itself was &quot;not breathtaking&quot;, although her flamboyant and colorful character appealed to children. She expressed a fondness for the show&#x27;s star, Elizabeth Montgomery, and said she had enjoyed working with her. Co-star Dick Sargent, who in 1969 replaced the ill Dick York as Samantha&#x27;s husband Darrin Stephens, had a more difficult relationship with Moorehead, describing her as &quot;a tough old bird.&quot;
In fall 1964, Moorehead participated in a 5-minute commercial spot featuring casts of both &quot;Bonanza&quot; and &quot;Bewitched&quot;, announcing the new 1965 Chevrolet line. Moorehead was featured with Dan Blocker extolling the virtues of the new &#x27;65 Chevy II.

===Later years===
In the 1970s, Moorehead&#x27;s life was increasingly affected by declining health. In 1970, Moorehead appeared as a dying woman who haunts her own house in the early &quot;Night Gallery&quot; episode &quot;Certain Shadows on the Wall&quot;. She co-starred with Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds in the horror film &quot;What&#x27;s the Matter with Helen?&quot; (1971) and had the lead role in the low-budget ax murderer film &quot;Dear Dead Delilah&quot; (1972) with Will Geer, her last starring role. She also reprised her role in &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot; on Broadway and on tour, with an all-star cast that featured Edward Mulhare, Ricardo Montalbán, and Paul Henreid.

Moorehead supplied the voice of the friendly &quot;Goose&quot; in Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s 1973 adaptation of E. B. White&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;.

For the 1973 Broadway adaptation of &quot;Gigi&quot;, Moorehead portrayed Aunt Alicia and performed various songs, including &quot;The Contract&quot; for the original cast recording. She fell ill during the production, resulting in Arlene Francis having to replace her. Moorehead died shortly afterward.

In January 1974, three months before her death, two episodes featuring Moorehead (including the series&#x27; premiere episode) aired on the &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;, the popular radio show produced and directed by Himan Brown.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===

In 1930, Moorehead married actor John Griffith Lee; they divorced a year after fostering a boy named Sean Lee in 1952. She married actor Robert Gist in 1954, and they divorced in 1958.

===Sexuality===
Moorehead&#x27;s sexuality had been the subject of much speculation and dispute. A number of articles that appeared in periodicals in the alternative press have identified her as a lesbian. Paul Lynde, Moorehead&#x27;s co-star on &quot;Bewitched&quot;, stated: &quot;Well, the whole world knows Agnes was a lesbian - I mean classy as hell, but one of the all-time Hollywood dykes&quot;. Journalist Boze Hadleigh reported an incident, also sourced to Lynde, in which, when she caught one of her husbands cheating on her, &quot;Agnes screamed at him that if he could have a mistress, so could she.&quot; In a 1973 interview with Hadleigh, when afforded the opportunity to either confirm or, once and for all, put to rest the rumors regarding her sexual orientation, Moorehead &quot;wryly&quot; opts to do neither:
Moorehead&#x27;s close friend Debbie Reynolds stated categorically that Moorehead was not a lesbian. Reynolds&#x27;s autobiography mentions the rumor and states it was started &quot;maliciously&quot; by one of Moorehead&#x27;s husbands during their divorce. Moorehead&#x27;s longtime friend and producer Paul Gregory concurs in the assessment. Quint Benedetti, Moorehead&#x27;s longtime employee who was homosexual, also stated that Moorehead was not a lesbian and attributed the story to Paul Lynde&#x27;s frequent gossiping and rumor-mongering.

===Politics===
Moorehead rarely spoke publicly about her political beliefs, but she supported both Franklin Delano Roosevelt (she portrayed Eleanor Roosevelt multiple times over the course of her career), and close friend Ronald Reagan for his 1966 run for governor of California.

==Death==
Moorehead was one of many people to have developed cancer after exposure to radioactive fallout from atmospheric atomic bomb tests while making &quot;The Conqueror&quot; (1956) with John Wayne in Iron City, Utah. Several production members, as well as Wayne himself, Susan Hayward, Pedro Armendáriz (who died by suicide while suffering from cancer), and the film&#x27;s director Dick Powell, later died from cancer and cancer-related illnesses. The cast and crew totalled 220 people. By the end of 1980, as ascertained by &quot;People&quot;, 91 of them had developed some form of cancer, and 46 had died of the disease.

Moorehead died at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Rochester, Minnesota, on April 30, 1974, due to uterine cancer at the age of 73.

Moorehead is entombed in a crypt at Dayton Memorial Park in Dayton, Ohio. In 1994, she was posthumously inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

Moorehead bequeathed $25,000 to Muskingum College, with instructions to fund one or more &quot;Agnes Moorehead Scholarships&quot;. She also left half of her manuscripts to Muskingum with the other half going to the University of Wisconsin. Her family&#x27;s Ohio farm went to John Brown University in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, along with her collection of Bibles and biblical scholarship materials.

Her mother Mary received all of Moorehead&#x27;s clothing and jewelry, and Moorehead made provisions to support Mary for the rest of her life. The Beverly Hills home was left to her attorney Franklin Rohner, along with the furnishings and personal property within. Small bequests were made for friends and domestic staff along with some charitable contributions. In her will, she made no provision for her foster son Sean Lee. In fact, she had fostered Sean only until his 18th birthday, and her will stated that she had &quot;no children, natural or adopted, living or deceased&quot;.

<text>Wind, Sand and Stars (French title: Terre des hommes, literally &quot;Land of Men&quot;) is a memoir by the French aristocrat aviator-writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, and a winner of several literary awards. 
It was first published in France in February 1939, and was then translated by Lewis Galantière and published in English by Reynal and Hitchcock in the United States later the same year.

The book&#x27;s themes deal with friendship, death, heroism, camaraderie and solidarity among colleagues, humanity and the search for meaning in life. The book illustrates the author&#x27;s view of the world and his opinions of what makes life worth living.

The central incident he wrote of detailed his 1935 plane crash in the Sahara Desert between Benghazi and Cairo, which he barely survived along with his mechanic-navigator, André Prévot. Saint-Exupéry and his navigator were left almost completely without water and food, and as the chances of finding an oasis or help from the air gradually decreased, the two men nearly died of thirst before they were saved by a Bedouin on a camel.

&quot;Wind, Sand and Stars&quot; also provided storylines for his book &quot;Le Petit Prince&quot; with many of the same themes outlined above, particularly camaraderie and friendship. 

==Publication history==
The book was first published in France in February 1939, and was then translated by Lewis Galantière and published in English by Reynal and Hitchcock in the United States later the same year. The French and English versions of this book differed significantly; Saint-Exupéry removed sections from the original French version he considered inappropriate for its targeted U.S. audience, and added new material specifically written for them, and Lewis Galantière translated the revised book into English. Although it did not appear in the earliest editions of its English translation, &quot;An Appreciation&quot; was added to later printings, contributed by Anne Morrow Lindbergh and earlier published in &quot;The Saturday Review of Literature&quot; on 14 October 1939.

Saint-Exupéry struggled to find a title for his book; the original working title was: &quot;Etoiles par grand vent&quot; (literally: &#x27;Stars in windy conditions&#x27;). He even promised 100 francs to André de Fonscolombe, his cousin, if André could come up with &#x27;the perfect title&#x27;. His cousin returned the day after with a list of 30 suggestions, and Saint-Exupéry chose one of them: &quot;Terre des Humains&quot; (literally: &#x27;Land of humans&#x27;), which later became &#x27;Terre des hommes&#x27; (&#x27;Land of men&#x27;). Lewis Galantière came up with the English title, which was approved by Saint-Exupéry.

Saint-Exupéry dedicated the book to his friend Henri Guillaumet of Aéropostale.

== Tributes ==
The charity Terre des hommes took its name from this book in 1959. The charitable international federation of humanitarian societies concentrates on children&#x27;s rights, and is based in Lausanne, Switzerland.

The book&#x27;s title was subsequently used to create the central theme (&quot;&quot;Terre des Hommes&quot; – Man and His World&quot;) of the most successful world&#x27;s fair of the 20th century, Expo 67, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. In 1963, a group of prominent Canadians met for three days at the Seigneury Club in Montebello, Quebec. In an introduction to the Expo 67 Corporation&#x27;s book, also entitled &quot;&quot;Terre des Hommes&quot;/Man and His World&quot;, Gabrielle Roy wrote:

Pascal Gélinas &amp; Pierre Harel&#x27;s short film &quot;Taire des hommes&quot; (meaning &quot;to silence men&quot;) has a title homophonic to the book&#x27;s title, but is instead about the censorship and repression at the riot of the national holiday of June 24, 1968, in downtown Montréal, one day before the federal election.

== Awards and recognitions ==

* Winner of the Grand Prix du roman de l&#x27;Académie française (Grand Prize for Fiction from the French Academy), 1939, one of France&#x27;s oldest and most prestigious literary awards.
* Winner of the U.S. National Book Award for 1939 Nonfiction. Saint-Exupéry only received the prize in early 1942, as he had been flying as a reconnaissance pilot during the Battle of France when the award was announced earlier.
* The &quot;National Geographic ADVENTURE&quot; voted the book No. 3 in its all-time list of 100 best adventure-exploration books.

* &quot;Outside&quot; magazine voted the book No. 1 in its all-time list of 25 adventure-explorer books.

It is a modernized adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy of the same name, albeit still utilizing Shakespearean English. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the title roles of two teenagers who fall in love, despite their being members of feuding families. Brian Dennehy, John Leguizamo, Miriam Margolyes, Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Sorvino and Diane Venora also star in supporting roles. It is the third major film version of the play, following adaptations by George Cukor in 1936 and by Franco Zeffirelli in 1968.

The film was released on November 1, 1996, by 20th Century Fox. It was met with generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $147 million against its $14.5 million budget. At the 47th Berlin International Film Festival in 1997, DiCaprio won the Silver Bear for Best Actor and Luhrmann won the Alfred Bauer Prize. At the 69th Academy Awards, Catherine Martin and Brigitte Broch were nominated for Best Art Direction/Set Decoration. In 2005, the film was included on the BFI list of the &quot;50 films you should watch by the age of 14&quot;.

The film was also re-released in Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Red Curtain Trilogy&quot; DVD box set in 2002 together with &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; (1992) and &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001).

==Plot==
In Verona Beach, the Capulets and Montagues are two rival business empires. The animosity of the older generation—Fulgencio and Gloria Capulet and Ted and Caroline Montague—is felt by their younger relatives. A shootout occurs between Montague Benvolio, Romeo&#x27;s cousin, and Capulet Tybalt, Juliet&#x27;s cousin, creating chaos in the city. The Chief of Police, Captain Prince, arrests Benvolio and Tybalt before reprimanding the families, warning them that if such an event occurs again, their lives &quot;shall pay the forfeit of the peace&quot;.

Benvolio and Romeo learn of a Capulet party that evening, which they decide to gate-crash. Romeo agrees on hearing that Rosaline, with whom he is madly in love, is attending. They meet their friend, Mercutio, who has tickets to the party, and Romeo takes ecstasy as they proceed to the Capulet mansion. The effects of the drug and the party overwhelm Romeo, who goes to the restroom. There he sees and meets Juliet, and the two instantly fall in love, both unaware of who the other is. Tybalt spots Romeo and vows to kill him for trespassing into his family&#x27;s home.

After Romeo leaves the party, he and Juliet each learn that they belong to feuding families, but Romeo returns to see her. He proposes. Juliet tells him that if he sends word by the following day, they will be betrothed. The next day, Romeo asks Father Laurence to marry them, and he agrees. Romeo passes the word on via Juliet&#x27;s nurse, and they soon get married.

Tybalt encounters Mercutio and Romeo at the beach. Romeo attempts to make peace, but Tybalt assaults him. Mercutio intervenes and batters Tybalt, and is about to kill him when Romeo stops him. Tybalt takes the opportunity to fatally wound Mercutio, who curses both houses before dying. Enraged, Romeo chases after the fleeing Tybalt and shoots him dead, avenging Mercutio’s death.

Captain Prince banishes Romeo from the city, and he goes into hiding with Father Laurence. The nurse arrives and tells him that Juliet is waiting for him. Romeo climbs Juliet&#x27;s balcony and they consummate their marriage, with Romeo departing the next morning. Meanwhile, Fulgencio decides Juliet will marry Dave Paris, the governor&#x27;s son.

The next morning, Gloria informs Juliet that she is to marry Paris, and when Juliet refuses, Fulgencio physically assaults her and threatens to disown her. Juliet runs away and seeks out Father Laurence, imploring him to help her, while threatening to commit suicide. Father Laurence gives her a potion that will let her fake her own death, after which she will be placed within the Capulet vault to awaken 24 hours later. Father Laurence vows to inform Romeo of the plot via overnight letter, whereupon the latter will sneak into the vault and, once reunited with Juliet, the two will escape to Mantua, a remote trailer park in the desert where Romeo has been hiding out. Romeo does not see the delivered letter, however, and, believing Juliet to be dead, buys a vial of poison from an apothecary.

Romeo enters the church where Juliet lies and consumes the poison just as Juliet wakes up. Distraught over Romeo’s death, Juliet picks up his gun and shoots herself in the head, falling down beside his lifeless body. Romeo&#x27;s body is being taken inside an ambulance with a crowd of spectators and reporters observing the incident from behind the police line, when the parents of both Romeo and Juliet arrive on the scene. Captain Prince approaches their fathers, and berates them both for the deaths of their children that their foolish brawl has caused.

Natalie Portman had been cast as Juliet but, during rehearsals, it was thought that she looked too young for the part, and the footage looked as though DiCaprio was &quot;molesting&quot; her. Luhrmann stated that Portman was too young at the time, and made DiCaprio look older than intended. He was 21 at the time of filming and Portman was only 14.

After Sarah Michelle Gellar turned down the role due to scheduling conflicts, DiCaprio proclaimed that Danes should be cast, as he felt she was genuine in her line delivery and did not try to impress him by acting flirtatious.

Christian Bale read for the role of Mercutio, but the production crew decided to go with an African-American actor for the role instead.

==Differences between the film and the original play==
While it retains the original Shakespearean dialogue, the film represents the Montagues and the Capulets as warring mafia empires (with legitimate business fronts) and the Capulets were &quot;a Latin family, sort of,&quot; played by Latin-American and Italian actors. It is set in contemporary United States, where swords are replaced by guns (with model names such as &quot;Dagger&quot;, &quot;Sword&quot;, and &quot;Rapier&quot;), and with a FedEx-style overnight delivery service called &quot;Post Haste&quot;.

Some characters&#x27; names are also changed: Paris, Lord and Lady Montague, and Lord and Lady Capulet are given first names (in the original, their first names are never mentioned); Friar Laurence becomes Father Laurence; and Prince Escalus is rewritten as the police chief of Verona Beach, being renamed Captain Prince.

The adaptation eliminates the character of Friar John, and some characters change families: in the original, Gregory and Sampson are Capulets, but in the film, they are Montagues; conversely, Abram, as Abra, is shifted from the Montague to the Capulet family.

==Production==
The film was an international co-production involving principals from the United States, Mexico, Australia, and Canada. After the success of his earlier film &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; (1992), Baz Luhrmann took some time deciding on his next project:
Luhrmann obtained some funds from Fox to do a workshop and shoot some teaser footage in Sydney. Leonardo DiCaprio agreed to pay his own expenses to fly to Sydney and be part of it. Once Fox saw footage of the fight scene, they agreed to support it.

All of the development was done in Australia, with pre-production in Australia and Canada and post-production in Australia. While some parts of the film were shot in Miami, most of the film was shot in Mexico City and Boca del Rio, Veracruz. For instance, the Capulet mansion was set at Chapultepec Castle, while the ballroom was built on Stage One of Churubusco Studios; the church exterior was the Templo del Purísimo Corazón de María (&quot;Immaculate Heart of Mary&quot;) in the Del Valle neighborhood.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film premiered on November 1, 1996, in the United States and Canada, in 1,276 theaters, and grossed $11.1 million its opening weekend, ranking number one at the US box office. It went on to gross $46.3 million in the United States and Canada.

In Australia, the film opened on Boxing Day and was number one at the Australian box office with a gross of A$3.3 million (US$2.6 million) for the week. It remained number one for a second week and returned to the top in its fourth week. It was the ninth highest-grossing film in Australia for 1997 with a calendar year gross of A$12.9 million. Overall, it has grossed US$12.6 million in Australia and US$147,554,998 worldwide.

===Critical response===
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported 74% of 69 critics gave a positive review, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s visual aesthetic is as divisive as it is fresh and inventive.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 60 out of 100 based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

James Berardinelli gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, &quot;Ultimately, no matter how many innovative and unconventional flourishes it applies, the success of any adaptation of a Shakespeare play is determined by two factors: the competence of the director and the ability of the main cast members. Luhrmann, Danes, and DiCaprio place this &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in capable hands.&quot;

Conversely, Roger Ebert gave the film a mixed review of only two stars out of four, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen &quot;King Lear&quot; as a samurai drama and &quot;Macbeth&quot; as a Mafia story, and two different &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;s about ethnic difficulties in Manhattan (&quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;China Girl&quot;), but I have never seen anything remotely approaching the mess that the new punk version of &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; makes of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; competed for the Golden Bear at the 47th Berlin International Film Festival, winning the Alfred Bauer Prize for Luhrmann and the Silver Bear for Best Actor for DiCaprio. It received seven nominations at the 51st British Academy Film Awards and won in four categories, including Best Direction and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film received a single nomination for Best Art Direction at the 69th Academy Awards.

Other notable ceremonies where it received much recognition included audience oriented award shows, such as the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards, and the MTV Movie Awards.

The film was originally released on DVD on March 19, 2002, by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. A 10th anniversary special edition DVD containing extra features and commentary was released on February 6, 2007, and a Blu-ray edition was released on October 19, 2010.

===Retrospective reviews===
The film maintains a popular reputation among English teachers, as a means through which to introduce secondary school students to the play. Although not to every critic&#x27;s taste, the film is now recognised as one of the most influential Shakespeare film adaptations ever made.

Miriam Margolyes, who played the nurse in the film, wrote about her experiences on the film in her 2021 memoir &quot;This Much Is True.&quot; On her co-star Leonardo DiCaprio, she wrote:

Leonardo has grown into an extremely fine actor but back then he was just a handsome boy who didn&#x27;t always wash; he was quite smelly in that very male way some young men are. Sometimes he wore a dress. &quot;Leonardo, I think you&#x27;re gay,&quot; I said. He laughed and said, &quot;No Miriam. I&#x27;m really not gay.&quot; But I was wrong. We filmed in Mexico City, paradise for someone like me who loves fossicking around flea markets and antiques shops, and, like me, Leonardo was into bling in a big way, too. We&#x27;d spend hours going through the markets together. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve ever had such fun.&quot;

She further commented on the chemistry between the film&#x27;s two leads:

I liked [DiCaprio] tremendously and admired his work, but luckily I was immune from his groin charms, unlike poor Claire Danes, then only 17. It was obvious to all of us that she really was in love with her Romeo, but Leonardo wasn&#x27;t in love with her. She wasn&#x27;t his type at all. He didn&#x27;t know how to cope with her evident infatuation. He wasn&#x27;t sensitive to her feelings, was dismissive of her and could be quite nasty in his keenness to get away, while Claire was utterly sincere and so open. It was painful to watch. Many years later, I was in a restaurant and she came up to me and said: &quot;We worked together on a film once, I don&#x27;t know if you remember me? My name is Claire Danes.&quot; It was the opposite of the arrogant behaviour of some stars and so typical of her.

<text>Stonehouse Creek, in Plymouth (England), is also known as Stonehouse Lake (on many maps). The Creek was dominated by two military buildings, the Royal Naval Hospital and the Stoke Military Hospital, which faced each other.

Also located in the creek are the modern shipbuilding sheds occupied by the luxury motor-yacht firm Princess Yachts who employ hundreds of local tradesmen to construct and fit out expensive vessels. The creek now ends at Stonehouse Bridge (for many years a toll bridge) and to the north east the wide river bed which led up past Millbridge to Pennycomequick and beyond to the bottom of Ford Park Cemetery, was reclaimed and infilled in 1973 to provide the playing fields of Victoria Park and rugby pitches for Devonport High School for Boys.

<text>How to Read a Book is a book by the American philosopher Mortimer J. Adler. Originally published in 1940, it was heavily revised for a 1972 edition, co-authored by Adler with editor Charles Van Doren. The 1972 revision gives guidelines for critically reading good and great books of any tradition. In addition, it deals with genres (including, but not limited to, poetry, history, science, and fiction), as well as inspectional and reading.

==Overview of the 1972 edition==
&quot;How to Read a Book&quot; is divided into four parts, each consisting of several chapters.

===Part 1: The Dimensions of Reading===
Here, Adler sets forth his method for reading a non-fiction book in order to gain understanding. He claims that three distinct approaches, or readings, must all be made in order to get the most possible out of a book, but that performing these three levels of readings does not necessarily mean reading the book three times, as the experienced reader will be able to do all three in the course of reading the book just once. Adler names the readings &quot;structural&quot;, &quot;interpretative&quot;, and &quot;critical&quot;, in that order.

&quot;Structural stage&quot;: The first stage of analytical reading is concerned with understanding the structure and purpose of the book. It begins with determining the basic topic and type of the book being read, so as to better anticipate the contents and comprehend the book from the very beginning. Adler says that the reader must distinguish between practical and theoretical books, as well as determining the field of study that the book addresses. Further, Adler says that the reader must note any divisions in the book, and that these are not restricted to the divisions laid out in the table of contents. Lastly, the reader must find out what problems the author is trying to solve.

&quot;Interpretive stage&quot;: The second stage of analytical reading involves constructing the author&#x27;s arguments. This first requires the reader to note and understand any special phrases and terms that the author uses. Once that is done, Adler says that the reader should find and work to understand each proposition that the author advances, as well as the author&#x27;s support for those propositions.

&quot;Critical stage&quot;: In the third stage of analytical reading, Adler directs the reader to critique the book. He asserts that upon understanding the author&#x27;s propositions and arguments, the reader has been elevated to the author&#x27;s level of understanding and is now able (and obligated) to judge the book&#x27;s merit and accuracy. Adler advocates judging books based on the soundness of their arguments. Adler says that one may not disagree with an argument unless one can find fault in its reasoning, facts, or premises, though one is free to dislike it in any case.

===Part 2: The Third Level of Reading: Analytical Reading===
Adler explains for whom the book is intended, defines different classes of reading, and tells which classes will be addressed. He also makes a brief argument favoring the Great Books, and explains his reasons for writing &quot;How to Read a Book&quot;.

There are three types of knowledge: practical, informational, and comprehensive. He discusses the methods of acquiring knowledge, concluding that 1. practical knowledge, though teachable, cannot be truly mastered without experience, 2. that only informational knowledge can be gained by one whose understanding equals the author&#x27;s, and 3. that comprehension (insight) is best learned from the person who first achieved said understanding – an &quot;original communication&quot; with the source of understanding.

The idea that communication directly from those who first discovered an idea is the best way of gaining understanding is Adler&#x27;s argument for reading the Great Books; that any book that does not represent original communication is inferior, as a source, to the original, and that any teacher, save those who discovered the subject he or she teaches, is inferior to the Great Books as a source of comprehension.

Adler spends a good deal of this first section explaining why he was compelled to write this book. He asserts that very few people can read a book for understanding, but that he believes that most are capable of it, given the right instruction and the will to do so. It is his intent to provide that instruction. He takes time to tell the reader about how he believes that the educational system has failed to teach students the art of reading well, up to and including undergraduate, university-level institutions. He concludes that, due to these shortcomings in formal education, it falls upon individuals to cultivate these abilities in themselves. Throughout this section, he relates anecdotes and summaries of his experience in education as support for these assertions.

===Part 3: Approaches to Different Kinds of Reading Matter===
In this part, Adler briefly discusses the differences in approaching various kinds of literature and suggests reading several other books. He explains a method of approaching the Great Books – read the books that influenced a given author prior to reading works by that author – and gives several examples of that method.

===Part 4: The Ultimate Goals of Reading===
The last part of the book covers the fourth level of reading: syntopical reading. At this stage, the reader broadens and deepens his or her knowledge on a given subjecte.g., love, war, particle physics, etc.by reading several books on that subject. In the final pages of this part, the author expounds on the philosophical benefits of reading: &quot;growth of the mind&quot;, fuller experience as a conscious being...

<text>Tim Paterson (born 1 June 1956) is an American computer programmer, best known for creating 86-DOS, an operating system for the Intel 8086. This system emulated the application programming interface (API) of CP/M, which was created by Gary Kildall. 86-DOS later formed the basis of MS-DOS, the most widely used personal computer operating system in the 1980s.

==Biography==
Paterson was educated in the Seattle Public Schools, graduating from Ingraham High School in 1974. He attended the University of Washington, working as a repair technician for The Retail Computer Store in the Green Lake area of Seattle, Washington, and graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a degree in Computer Science in June 1978. He went to work for Seattle Computer Products as a designer and engineer. He designed the hardware of Microsoft&#x27;s Z-80 SoftCard which had a Z80 CPU and ran the CP/M operating system on an Apple II.

A month later, Intel released the 8086 CPU, and Paterson went to work designing an S-100 8086 board, which went to market in November 1979. The only commercial software that existed for the board was Microsoft&#x27;s Standalone Disk BASIC-86. The standard CP/M operating system at the time was not available for this CPU and without a true operating system, sales were slow. Paterson began work on QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System) in April 1980 to fill that void, copying the APIs of CP/M from references, including the published CP/M manual, so that it would be highly compatible. QDOS was soon renamed as 86-DOS. Version 0.10 was complete by July 1980. By version 1.14, 86-DOS had grown to lines of assembly code. In December 1980, Microsoft secured the rights to market 86-DOS to other hardware manufacturers.

While acknowledging that he made 86-DOS compatible with CP/M, Paterson has maintained that the 86-DOS program was his original work and has denied allegations that he referred to CP/M code while writing it. When a book appeared in 2004 claiming that 86-DOS was an unoriginal &quot;rip-off&quot; of CP/M, Paterson sued the authors and publishers for defamation.
The judge found that Paterson failed to &quot;provide any evidence regarding &#x27;serious doubts&#x27; about the accuracy of the Gary Kildall chapter. Instead, a careful review of the Lefer notes ... provides a research picture tellingly close to the substance of the final chapter&quot; and the case was dismissed on the basis that the book&#x27;s claims were constitutionally protected opinions and not provably false.

Paterson left SCP in April 1981 and worked for Microsoft from May 1981 to April 1982. Microsoft renamed 86-DOS to MS-DOS on 27 July 1981. After a brief second stint with SCP, Paterson started his own company, Falcon Technology, a.k.a. Falcon Systems. In 1983, Microsoft contracted Paterson to port MS-DOS to the MSX computers standard they were developing with ASCII Corporation. Paterson accepted the contract to help fund his company and completed the work on the MSX-DOS operating system in 1984. Falcon Technology was bought by Microsoft in 1986 to reclaim one out of two issued royalty-free licenses for MS-DOS (the other belonging to SCP), eventually becoming part of Phoenix Technologies. Paterson worked a second stint with Microsoft from 1986 to 1988, and a third stint from 1990 to 1998, during which time he worked on Visual Basic.

After leaving Microsoft a third time, Paterson founded another software development company, Paterson Technology, and also made several appearances on the Comedy Central television program &quot;BattleBots&quot;. Paterson has also raced rally cars in the SCCA Pro Rally series, and even engineered his own trip computer, which he integrated into the axle of a four-wheel-drive Porsche 911.

<doc id="202657" wikidata="Q1995249" url="?curid=202657" title="Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)">
<text>Witch Hazel is an animated cartoon character in the Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons and TV shows. Witch Hazel is a fairy tale witch antagonist with green skin, a round figure, bulbous facial features, and a single tooth. The name is a pun on the witch-hazel plant and folk remedies based on it.

Created by Chuck Jones during the golden age of American animation, the character was originally voiced by Bea Benaderet in 1954&#x27;s &quot;Bewitched Bunny&quot;. Benaderet would later be replaced by June Foray, who voiced the character almost exclusively beginning with 1956&#x27;s &quot;Broom-Stick Bunny&quot; and concluding with 2002&#x27;s &quot;Twick or Tweety&quot;. Tress MacNeille would briefly voice Witch Hazel from 1992 to 1994 for episodes of &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; and &quot;Animaniacs&quot;. After Foray&#x27;s departure from the role, the character was voiced by Roz Ryan from 2011 to 2013 for &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; (as Witch Lezah) and by Candi Milo from 2017 onward.

==Concept and creation==
Different characters of the same name appeared in several studios&#x27; short films throughout the golden age of American animation: the first was in the Disney cartoon &quot;Trick or Treat&quot; (1952), voiced by June Foray. Inspired by this character, Chuck Jones created his own witch for Warner Bros., reusing the same pun. Jones could do this because the name was already in use in commercial products; Foray said that the characters were also not expected to have any longevity. In her initial appearance, &quot;Bewitched Bunny&quot; (1954), she is voiced by Bea Benaderet. Starting with &quot;Broom-Stick Bunny&quot; (1956), Foray took over voicing the character. To differentiate the characters, Foray said that she performed the Disney version with a British accent, but the Warner Bros. version was &quot;all American&quot;.

Despite their common name, Jones&#x27; Witch Hazel is a much different witch from her Disney counterpart. The Looney Tunes character is a highly stylized villainess. Her rotund, green-skinned body is wrapped in a plain, blue dress and supported by twig-like legs. She has wild black hair from which hairpins fly and spin in midair whenever she zooms off on her broom or cackles in glee over her next evil scheme and she wears a crumpled black hat. Her nose and chin jut bulbously from her face and her mouth sports a single tooth. She has two pets: a tarantula named Paul, and a black cat. She also has two magic brooms: one for sweeping the floor and one for flying.

==Appearances==
===Golden age===

&quot;Bewitched Bunny&quot; retells the fairy tale about &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;. Witch Hazel plays the witch who attempts to cook and eat the children. Bugs Bunny witnesses her coax the children inside and saves the youths from Witch Hazel&#x27;s clutches because the Masked Avenger is not around. Once the witch realizes that Bugs is a rabbit, she chases him to put him into her witch&#x27;s brew. Upon putting Bugs into a sleeping spell, he is awoken by a kiss from Prince Charming; Bugs then tells him that he is in the wrong story. Bugs eventually uses Hazel&#x27;s own magic against her and transforms her into a sexy female rabbit, to whom he is instantly attracted. He walks away with her while he breaks the fourth wall and comments, &quot;Ah sure, I know. But aren&#x27;t they all witches inside?&quot;

In &quot;Broom-Stick Bunny&quot;, Witch Hazel takes great pride in her status as the ugliest witch. While trick-or-treating on Halloween as a witch, Bugs Bunny visits Witch Hazel&#x27;s house and she mistakes him for an actual witch. So does her magic mirror, which warns, &quot;You&#x27;re an ugly one, &#x27;tis true; but &quot;that&quot; creep is uglier far than you!&quot; Jealous that this newcomer is uglier than herself, Hazel attempts to trick the &quot;witch&quot; into drinking a &quot;Pretty Potion&quot; disguised as tea. Bugs removes his mask to drink it and she becomes obsessed with using the rabbit in her witch&#x27;s brew. Hazel captures him by tricking him with a carrot. Hazel is about to kill Bugs, but becomes distraught when his sad eyes remind her of Paul, her pet tarantula. Bugs calms her down with a beverage which turns out to be the Pretty Potion. Transformed into a beautiful young woman, Hazel asks her magic mirror if she is still ugly. The genie in her mirror instantly falls in love with her and Hazel flies off into the night on her flying broomstick and the genie chases after her on his magic carpet. Bugs calls Air Raid headquarters to alert them about a &quot;Flying Socceress chased by a Genie with light brown hair.&quot;

Bugs Bunny was pitted against Witch Hazel for the last time in &quot;A Witch&#x27;s Tangled Hare&quot; (1959), a parody of &quot;Macbeth&quot;. This short was directed by Abe Levitow. Rabbit is once again the missing ingredient to Witch Hazel&#x27;s brew and Bugs happens to be in the area. Meanwhile, a William Shakespeare look-alike observes the action in search of inspiration. Bugs finds out that the man is not William Shakespeare, but is actually a man named Sam Crubish. Witch Hazel hears this and it appears that the two know each other but have not seen each other in a while because Crubish had the wrong apartment number, &quot;2B&quot;. The poet and Witch Hazel leave talking about who made the mistake. Bugs Bunny quotes the famous line from &quot;Hamlet&quot; – &quot;To be, or not to be, that is the question.&quot;

The Bugs Bunny short &quot;Transylvania 6-5000&quot; (1963) features a brief, silent cameo appearance from Witch Hazel (or a character very similar to her) as Bugs briefly transforms Count Bloodcount, the cartoon&#x27;s vampire antagonist, into her through the use of a magic spell.

Once production shifted to DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, Witch Hazel appeared in the cartoon &quot;A-Haunting We Will Go&quot; (1966), which also starred Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales.

===After the Golden Age===
All four of Witch Hazel&#x27;s original &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short cartoons were edited and repurposed into the 1977 television special &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Howl-oween Special&quot;. June Foray recorded new and redubbed dialogue for Witch Hazel in the special, including in newly animated content to link the classic clips together into one narrative.

Witch Hazel made a cameo in the deleted &quot;Pig Head&quot; scene of the film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988)&quot;.&quot; She is seen flying around on Beelzebub before getting struck by lightning.

Witch Hazel has appeared in cameos in various Warner Bros. productions, such as the movie &quot;Space Jam&quot; (1996) and its stand-alone sequel &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot; (2021), the video games &quot;The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2&quot; (in which she is the primary antagonist), &quot;Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time&quot; (in which she appears as a boss and also appears on the cover of the game) and &quot;Looney Tunes Collector: Alert!&quot; (2000), one episode each of &quot;Animaniacs&quot; (in a Rita and Runt episode), &quot;The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;, &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; and &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; (which references &quot;Broom-Stick Bunny&quot; and where June Foray returns to do her voice). She was also featured as the lead antagonist in DC Comics&#x27; three-issue &quot;Bugs Bunny&quot; miniseries from 1990 (though at the ending of the storyline, her appearance there is actually revealed to be a disguised Wile E. Coyote). She was used as an enemy in Scott Lowenstein&#x27;s &quot;Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 4&quot; and her silhouette can be seen on the cover of the game. Witch Hazel has a cameo in the video game adaptation of &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; as a painting parodying the Mona Lisa in the Louvre Museum. Witch Hazel is also spotted in a &quot;MetLife&quot; commercial in 2012.

Witch Hazel also makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the film &quot;Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run&quot;.

Witch Hazel also starred in the &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot; segments &quot;Finders Keepers, Losers Sweepers&quot;, &quot;Hiccups and Downs&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Snout or Never&quot;.

Witch Hazel made her first appearance in the &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot; short &quot;Hex Appeal&quot;, which is part of a Halloween special titled &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Howl-O-Skreem Spooktacula&quot;.

Witch Hazel appears in the &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; episode, &quot;Warner Bros. 100th Anniversary&quot;. She is among the Looney Tunes characters guests for the Warner Bros. centennial celebration.

===Witch Lezah===
The 2011 animated series &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; introduces Witch Hazel renamed to Witch Lezah. Lezah (&quot;Hazel&quot; spelled backwards) is voiced by Roz Ryan, who gives the character a pronounced African American patois. In the series, she is Gossamer&#x27;s mother. Unlike the other characters and her original character, she is always serious and gives advice that is not nonsensical and is more calm. She has a contradictory relationship with Daffy; she once threatened him into helping Gossamer make friends. Once Gossamer has friends she asks Daffy to stay away despite all his hard work. She has been a hypnotherapist by trade, as seen in &quot;Point, Laser Point&quot;, where she provided Sylvester with services when he was in denial about his relationship with his mother. In &quot;It&#x27;s a Handbag&quot;, she helped Daffy recall who took his handbag. In &quot;Best Friends Redux&quot;, Witch Lezah has a time portal in her home, which Daffy uses to jealously ensure that Bugs Bunny and Rodney Rabbit never meet. When nobody knows Daffy, Witch Lezah, who is unaffected by the time change, sends Daffy back in time to correct it, as it&#x27;s ultimately because of Rodney that Bugs and Daffy met and became friends. Daffy uses Witch Lezah&#x27;s time portal again to make sure he and Porky Pig meet.

<doc id="202659" wikidata="Q7619235" url="?curid=202659" title="Stonehouse, Plymouth">
<text>East Stonehouse was one of three towns that were amalgamated into modern-day Plymouth, in the ceremonial county of Devon, England. [[Cremyll|West Stonehouse]] was a village that is within the current Mount Edgcumbe Country Park in Cornwall. It was destroyed by the French in 1350.
The terminology used in this article refers to the settlement of East Stonehouse which is on the Devon side of the mouth of the Tamar estuary, and will be referred to as Stonehouse.

==History==
Settlement in the area goes back to Roman times and a house made of stone was believed to have stood near to Stonehouse Creek. However other stories relate to land owned in the 13th century by Robert the Bastard. This land subsequently passed from the Durnford family, through marriage, to the Edgecombe family in the 14th and 15th centuries. The site of the original settlement of Stonehouse is now mostly occupied by the complex of Princess Yachts.

During the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries the areas of Emma Place and Caroline Place were home to many of the west country&#x27;s top-ranking admirals, doctors and clergy. Those streets together with Millbay Road used to form Plymouth&#x27;s red light district. Union Street, originally built across marshland, was for almost a century the centre of the city&#x27;s night life with about a hundred pubs, a music hall and many other attractions. Much of it was destroyed by bombing in World War II. After the war the area between Union Street and the dock has been used by small factories, storage, car dealers and repairers. For decades it remained underdeveloped compared with other parts of Plymouth.

===Administrative history===
Stonehouse was historically a chapelry of the parish of Plymouth St Andrew&#x27;s, covering the part of the parish which lay outside Plymouth&#x27;s borough boundaries. Stonehouse was made a separate parish in 1746. The parish of East Stonehouse was made a local government district in 1872, governed by a local board. Such local boards were reconstituted as urban district councils in 1894.

East Stonehouse Urban District was abolished in 1914, being absorbed into the county borough of Plymouth, along with neighbouring Devonport. East Stonehouse remained a civil parish until 1 April 1974, but as an urban parish it had no practical functions, being directly administered by Plymouth Corporation. In 1951 the parish had a population of 7770.

==Notable buildings==
Significant buildings include the Royal William Victualling Yard, the Royal Marine Barracks, Stonehouse and the Royal Naval Hospital, Stonehouse. Of these three defence complexes only the Barracks remain in Naval possession.

During the reign of Henry VII defences at the mouth of the Tamar were strengthened by the building of cannon-bearing towers. One of these, the Artillery Tower at the sea end of Durnford Street, has been preserved and is now a restaurant.

Two of the surviving buildings close to the dock at Millbay are the red brick Portland stone-faced Georgian assembly room that is still called the Long Room, and the exquisite late Georgian or early Victorian Globe Theatre 300 metres north within the barracks.

On the higher ground towards North Road are two major churches. Firstly the Anglican St Peter&#x27;s with its tall spire in the centre of Georgian style Wyndham Square. A few hundred metres east is the mid Victorian Roman Catholic cathedral of St Mary and St Boniface (1858).

During 1882, Arthur Conan Doyle worked as a newly qualified physician at 1 Durnford Street, East Stonehouse. Plaques bearing passages from his works featuring Sherlock Holmes have since been set into the pavement in Durnford Street.

==Demographics==
Stonehouse has 29.1% of the working age population claiming benefits and has the highest death rate for Cancer, CHD, COPD and Stroke in Plymouth. Stonehouse is part of the St. Peter and the Waterfront ward; the most deprived ward in Plymouth and in the 1% most disadvantaged districts in England.

==Regeneration==
Between 1993 and 1998 the part of Stonehouse to the west of Durnford Street (including the Royal William Victualling Yard) was designated as one of the three areas of the city under control of Plymouth Development Corporation. Gradually affluent residents are moving back into the district which has been comparatively poor since the Great War. Durnford Street is being regentrified. The former Naval Hospital (adjacent to the Millfields – formerly part of Stonehouse Creek) is a gated community with security guards. However, Royal William Yard, also a walled site, welcomes the public freely (apart from car parking charges) to its increasing number of food outlets, and has part of the South West Coast Path running through it, using a staircase specially constructed in 2013. In 2013 a marina was opened within Millbay Docks.

On Stonehouse Creek, a branch of the Tamar, off the estuary known as the Hamoaze are the modern shipbuilding sheds occupied by the luxury motor-yacht firm Princess Yachts who employ hundreds of local tradesmen to construct and fit out expensive vessels. The creek now ends at Stonehouse Bridge (for many years a toll bridge) and to the north east the wide river bed which led up past Millbridge to Pennycomequick and beyond to the bottom of Ford Park Cemetery, was reclaimed and infilled in 1973 to provide the playing fields of Victoria Park and rugby pitches for Devonport High School for Boys.

Stonehouse is the site of Plymouth&#x27;s international ferry port at Millbay with at least daily sailings to Roscoff in Brittany (except in winter) and frequent ferries to Santander in northern Spain.

There is a regular passenger ferry from the tidal landing Admiral&#x27;s Hard to Cremyll in Cornwall which is used by visitors to the Mount Edgcumbe Country Park, and commuters to Plymouth.

<text>Stellar parallax is the apparent shift of position (&quot;parallax&quot;) of any nearby star (or other object) against the background of distant stars. By extension, it is a method for determining the distance to the star through trigonometry, the stellar parallax method. Created by the different orbital positions of Earth, the extremely small observed shift is largest at time intervals of about six months, when Earth arrives at opposite sides of the Sun in its orbit, giving a baseline (the shortest side of the triangle made by a star to be observed and two positions of Earth) distance of about two astronomical units between observations. The parallax itself is considered to be half of this maximum, about equivalent to the observational shift that would occur due to the different positions of Earth and the Sun, a baseline of one astronomical unit (AU).

Stellar parallax is so difficult to detect that its existence was the subject of much debate in astronomy for hundreds of years. Thomas Henderson, Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve, and Friedrich Bessel made the first successful parallax measurements in 1832–1838, for the stars Alpha Centauri, Vega, and 61 Cygni.

==History of measurement==

=== Early theory and attempts ===

Stellar parallax is so small that it was unobservable until the 19th century, and its apparent absence was used as a scientific argument against heliocentrism during the early modern age. It is clear from Euclid&#x27;s geometry that the effect would be undetectable if the stars were far enough away, but for various reasons, such gigantic distances involved seemed entirely implausible: it was one of Tycho Brahe&#x27;s principal objections to Copernican heliocentrism that for it to be compatible with the lack of observable stellar parallax, there would have to be an enormous and unlikely void between the orbit of Saturn and the eighth sphere (the fixed stars).

James Bradley first tried to measure stellar parallaxes in 1729. The stellar movement proved too insignificant for his telescope, but he instead discovered the aberration of light and the nutation of Earth&#x27;s axis, and catalogued 3,222 stars.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===

Measurement of annual parallax was the first reliable way to determine the distances to the closest stars. In the second quarter of the 19th century, technological progress reached to the level which provided sufficient accuracy and precision for stellar parallax measurements. Giuseppe Calandrelli noted stellar parallax in 1805-6 and came up with a 4-second value for the star Vega which was a gross overestimate. The first successful stellar parallax measurements were done by Thomas Henderson in Cape Town South Africa in 1832–1833, where he measured parallax of one of the closest stars, Alpha Centauri. Between 1835 and 1836, astronomer Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve at the Dorpat university observatory measured the distance of Vega, publishing his results in 1837. Friedrich Bessel, a friend of Struve, carried out an intense observational campaign in 1837–1838 at Koenigsberg Observatory for the star 61 Cygni using a heliometer, and published his results in 1838. Henderson published his results in 1839, after returning from South Africa.

Those three results, two of which were measured with the best instruments at the time (Fraunhofer great refractor used by Struve and Fraunhofer heliometer by Bessel) were the first ones in history to establish the reliable distance scale to the stars.

A large heliometer was installed at Kuffner Observatory (In Vienna) in 1896, and was used for measuring the distance to other stars by trigonometric parallax. By 1910 it had computed 16 parallax distances to other stars, out of only 108 total known to science at that time.

Being very difficult to measure, only about 60 stellar parallaxes had been obtained by the end of the 19th century, mostly by use of the filar micrometer. Astrographs using astronomical photographic plates sped the process in the early 20th century. Automated plate-measuring machines and more sophisticated computer technology of the 1960s allowed more efficient compilation of star catalogues. In the 1980s, charge-coupled devices (CCDs) replaced photographic plates and reduced optical uncertainties to one milliarcsecond.

Stellar parallax remains the standard for calibrating other measurement methods (see Cosmic distance ladder). Accurate calculations of distance based on stellar parallax require a measurement of the distance from Earth to the Sun, now known to exquisite accuracy based on radar reflection off the surfaces of planets.

== Space astrometry ==

In 1989, the satellite Hipparcos was launched primarily for obtaining parallaxes and proper motions of nearby stars, increasing the number of stellar parallaxes measured to milliarcsecond accuracy a thousandfold. Even so, Hipparcos is only able to measure parallax angles for stars up to about 1,600 light-years away, a little more than one percent of the diameter of the Milky Way Galaxy.

The Hubble telescope WFC3 now has a precision of 20 to 40 microarcseconds, enabling reliable distance measurements up to for a small number of stars. This gives more accuracy to the cosmic distance ladder and improves the knowledge of distances in the Universe, based on the dimensions of the Earth&#x27;s orbit.

As distances between the two points of observation are increased, the visual effect of the parallax is likewise rendered more visible. NASA&#x27;s New Horizons spacecraft performed the first interstellar parallax measurement on 22 April 2020, taking images of Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359 in conjunction with earth-based observatories. The relative proximity of the two stars combined with the 6.5 billion kilometer (about 43 AU) distance of the spacecraft from Earth yielded a discernible parallax of arcminutes, allowing the parallax to be seen visually without instrumentation.

The European Space Agency&#x27;s Gaia mission, launched 19 December 2013, is expected to measure parallax angles to an accuracy of 10 microarcseconds for all moderately bright stars, thus mapping nearby stars (and potentially planets) up to a distance of tens of thousands of light-years from Earth. Data Release 2 in 2018 claims mean errors for the parallaxes of 15th magnitude and brighter stars of 20–40 microarcseconds.

=== Radio astrometry ===
Very long baseline interferometry in the radio band can produce images with angular resolutions of about 1 milliarcsecond, and hence, for bright radio sources, the precision of parallax measurements made in the radio can easily exceed those of optical telescopes like Gaia. These measurements tend to be sensitivity limited, and need to be made one at a time, so the work is generally done only for sources like pulsars and X-ray binaries, where the radio emission is strong relative to the optical emission.

== Parallax method ==

=== Principle ===

Throughout the year the position of a star S is noted in relation to other stars in its apparent neighborhood: 

Stars that did not seem to move in relation to each other are used as reference points to determine the path of S.

The observed path is an ellipse: the projection of Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun through S onto the distant background of non-moving stars. The farther S is removed from Earth&#x27;s orbital axis, the greater the eccentricity of the path of S. The center of the ellipse corresponds to the point where S would be seen from the Sun: 

The plane of Earth&#x27;s orbit is at an angle to a line from the Sun through S. The vertices v and v&#x27; of the elliptical projection of the path of S are projections of positions of Earth E and such that a line E- intersects the line Sun-S at a right angle; the triangle created by points E, and S is an isosceles triangle with the line Sun-S as its symmetry axis.

Any stars that did not move between observations are, for the purpose of the accuracy of the measurement, infinitely far away. This means that the distance of the movement of the Earth compared to the distance to these infinitely far away stars is, within the accuracy of the measurement, 0. Thus a line of sight from Earth&#x27;s first position E to vertex v will be essentially the same as a line of sight from the Earth&#x27;s second position to the same vertex v, and will therefore run parallel to it - impossible to depict convincingly in an image of limited size: 

Since line - is a transversal in the same (approximately Euclidean) plane as parallel lines E-v and -v, it follows that the corresponding angles of intersection of these parallel lines with this transversal are congruent: the angle θ between lines of sight E-v and - is equal to the angle θ between -v and -, which is the angle θ between observed positions of S in relation to its apparently unmoving stellar surroundings. 

The distance &quot;d&quot; from the Sun to S now follows from simple trigonometry:

 tan(θ) = E-Sun / d,

so that d = E-Sun / tan(θ), where E-Sun is 1 AU.

The more distant an object is, the smaller its parallax.

Stellar parallax measures are given in the tiny units of arcseconds, or even in thousandths of arcseconds (milliarcseconds). The distance unit parsec is defined as the length of the leg of a right triangle adjacent to the angle of one arcsecond at one vertex, where the other leg is 1 AU long. Because stellar parallaxes and distances all involve such skinny right triangles, a convenient trigonometric approximation can be used to convert parallaxes (in arcseconds) to distance (in parsecs). The approximate distance is simply the reciprocal of the parallax: formula_1 For example, Proxima Centauri (the nearest star to Earth other than the Sun), whose parallax is 0.7685, is 1 / 0.7685 parsecs = distant.

=== Variants ===

Stellar parallax is most often measured using annual parallax, defined as the difference in position of a star as seen from Earth and Sun, i.e. the angle subtended at a star by the mean radius of Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun. The parsec (3.26 light-years) is defined as the distance for which the annual parallax is 1 arcsecond. Annual parallax is normally measured by observing the position of a star at different times of the year as Earth moves through its orbit.

The angles involved in these calculations are very small and thus difficult to measure. The nearest star to the Sun (and also the star with the largest parallax), Proxima Centauri, has a parallax of 0.7685 ± 0.0002 arcsec. This angle is approximately that subtended by an object 2 centimeters in diameter located 5.3 kilometers away.

=== Derivation ===
For a right triangle,
: formula_2
where formula_3 is the parallax, is approximately the average distance from the Sun to Earth, and formula_4 is the distance to the star.
Using small-angle approximations (valid when the angle is small compared to 1 radian),
: formula_5
so the parallax, measured in arcseconds, is
:formula_6
If the parallax is 1&quot;, then the distance is
:formula_7
This &quot;defines&quot; the parsec, a convenient unit for measuring distance using parallax. Therefore, the distance, measured in parsecs, is simply formula_8, when the parallax is given in arcseconds.

===Error===
Precise parallax measurements of distance have an associated error. This error in the measured parallax angle does not translate directly into an error for the distance, except for relatively small errors. The reason for this is that an error toward a smaller angle results in a greater error in distance than an error toward a larger angle.

However, an approximation of the distance error can be computed by
:formula_9
where &quot;d&quot; is the distance and &quot;p&quot; is the parallax. The approximation is far more accurate for parallax errors that are small relative to the parallax than for relatively large errors. For meaningful results in stellar astronomy, Dutch astronomer Floor van Leeuwen recommends that the parallax error be no more than 10% of the total parallax when computing this error estimate.

<text>Diane Keaton (née Hall; born January 5, 1946) is an American actress. She has received various accolades throughout her career spanning over five decades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and two Golden Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for a Tony Award and two Emmy Awards. She was honored with the Film Society of Lincoln Center Gala Tribute in 2007 and an AFI Life Achievement Award in 2017.

Keaton&#x27;s career began on stage when she appeared in the original 1968 Broadway production of the musical &quot;Hair&quot;. The next year she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her performance in Woody Allen&#x27;s comic play &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot;. She then made her screen debut in a small role in &quot;Lovers and Other Strangers&quot; (1970), before rising to prominence with her first major film role as Kay Adams-Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), a role she reprised in its sequels &quot;Part II&quot; (1974) and &quot;Part III&quot; (1990). She has frequently collaborated with Woody Allen, beginning with the film adaptation of &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot; (1972). Her next two films with him, &quot;Sleeper&quot; (1973) and &quot;Love and Death&quot; (1975), established her as a comic actress, while her fourth, &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977), won her the Academy Award for Best Actress.

To avoid being typecast as her &quot;Annie Hall&quot; persona, Keaton appeared in several dramatic films, starring in &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot; (1977) and &quot;Interiors&quot; (1978). She received three more Academy Award nominations for her roles as activist Louise Bryant in &quot;Reds&quot; (1981), a leukemia patient in &quot;Marvin&#x27;s Room&quot; (1996), and a dramatist in &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot; (2003). Keaton is also known for her starring roles in &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979), &quot;Baby Boom&quot; (1987), &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1991), &quot;Father of the Bride Part II&quot; (1995), &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; (1996), &quot;The Family Stone&quot; (2005), &quot;Finding Dory&quot; (2016) and &quot;Book Club&quot; (2018).

== Early life and education ==
Keaton was born Diane Hall in Los Angeles, California on January 5, 1946. Her mother, Dorothy Deanne (née Keaton), was a homemaker and amateur photographer; her father, John Newton Ignatius &quot;Jack&quot; Hall, was a real estate broker and civil engineer, whose mother had come from Ireland. Keaton was raised a Free Methodist by her mother. Her mother won the &quot;Mrs. Los Angeles&quot; pageant for homemakers; Keaton has said that the theatricality of the event inspired her first impulse to be an actress, and led to her desire to work on stage. She has also credited Katharine Hepburn, whom she admires for playing strong and independent women, as one of her inspirations.

Keaton is a 1963 graduate of Santa Ana High School in Santa Ana, California. During her time there, she participated in singing and acting clubs at school, and starred as Blanche DuBois in a school production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. After graduation, she attended Santa Ana College, and later Orange Coast College as an acting student, but dropped out after a year to pursue an entertainment career in Manhattan. Upon joining the Actors&#x27; Equity Association, she changed her surname to Keaton, which was her mother&#x27;s maiden name, as there was already an actress registered under the name of Diane Hall. For a brief time she also moonlighted at nightclubs with a singing act. She revisited her nightclub act in &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977), &quot;And So It Goes&quot; (2014), and a cameo in &quot;Radio Days&quot; (1987).

Keaton began studying acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. She initially studied acting under the Meisner technique, an ensemble acting technique first evolved in the 1930s by Sanford Meisner, a New York stage actor/acting coach/director who had been a member of The Group Theater (1931–1940). She describes her acting technique as, &quot;[being] only as good as the person you&#x27;re acting with ... As opposed to going it on my own and forging my path to create a wonderful performance without the help of anyone. I always need the help of everyone!&quot; According to fellow actor Jack Nicholson, &quot;She approaches a script sort of like a play in that she has the entire script memorized before you start doing the movie, which I don&#x27;t know any other actors doing that.&quot;

== Career ==

=== 1970s ===
In 1968, Keaton became an understudy for the part of Sheila in the original Broadway production of &quot;Hair&quot;. She gained some notoriety for her refusal to disrobe at the end of Act I when the cast performs nude, even though nudity in the production was optional for actors (those who performed nude received a $50 bonus). After acting in &quot;Hair&quot; for nine months, she auditioned for a part in Woody Allen&#x27;s production of &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot;. After nearly being passed over for being too tall (at , she is taller than Allen), she won the part. She went on to receive a Tony Award nomination for a Best Featured Actress in a Play for her performance in &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot;.
The next year, Keaton made her film debut in &quot;Lovers and Other Strangers&quot;. She followed with guest roles on the television series &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, and &quot;Mannix&quot;. Between films, Keaton appeared in a series of deodorant commercials.

Keaton&#x27;s breakthrough role came two years later when she was cast as Kay Adams, the girlfriend and eventual wife of Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Coppola noted that he first noticed Keaton in &quot;Lovers and Other Strangers&quot;, and cast her because of her reputation for eccentricity that he wanted her to bring to the role (Keaton claims that at the time she was commonly referred to as &quot;the kooky actress&quot; of the film industry). Her performance in the film was loosely based on her real-life experience of making the film, both of which she has described as being &quot;the woman in a world of men.&quot; &quot;The Godfather&quot; was an unparalleled critical and financial success, becoming the highest-grossing film of the year and winning the 1972 Academy Award for Best Picture.

Two years later, she reprised her role as Kay Adams in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;. She was initially reluctant, saying, &quot;At first, I was skeptical about playing Kay again in the &quot;Godfather&quot; sequel. But when I read the script, the character seemed much more substantial than in the first film.&quot; In &quot;Part II&quot;, her character changed dramatically, becoming more embittered about her husband&#x27;s criminal empire. Even though Keaton received widespread exposure from the films, some critics felt that her character&#x27;s importance was minimal. &quot;Time&quot; wrote that she was &quot;invisible in &quot;The Godfather&quot; and pallid in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, but according to &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, Keaton &quot;proves the quiet lynchpin which is no mean feat in [the] necessarily male dominated films.&quot;

Keaton&#x27;s other notable films of the 1970s included many collaborations with Woody Allen. She played many eccentric characters in several of his comic and dramatic films, including &quot;Sleeper&quot;, &quot;Love and Death&quot;, &quot;Interiors&quot;, &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Manhattan Murder Mystery&quot; and the film version of &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot;, directed by Herbert Ross. Allen has credited Keaton as his muse during his early film career.

In 1977, Keaton won the Academy Award for Best Actress for Allen&#x27;s romantic comedy-drama &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, one of her most famous roles. &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, written by Allen and Marshall Brickman and directed by Allen, was believed by many to be an autobiographical exploration of his relationship with Keaton. Allen based the character of Annie Hall loosely on Keaton (&quot;Annie&quot; is a nickname of hers, and &quot;Hall&quot; is her original surname). Many of Keaton&#x27;s mannerisms and her self-deprecating sense of humor were added into the role by Allen. (Director Nancy Meyers has claimed: &quot;Diane&#x27;s the most self-deprecating person alive.&quot;) Keaton has also said that Allen wrote the character as an &quot;idealized version&quot; of herself. The two starred as a frequently on-again, off-again couple living in New York City. Her acting was later summed up by CNN as &quot;awkward, self-deprecating, speaking in endearing little whirlwinds of semi-logic&quot;, and by Allen as a &quot;nervous breakdown in slow motion.&quot; &quot;Annie Hall&quot; emerged as a major critical and commercial success and won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Of Keaton&#x27;s performance, feminist film critic Molly Haskell wrote, &quot;Keaton took me by surprise in &quot;Annie Hall&quot;. Here she blossomed into something more than just another kooky dame—she put the finishing touches on a type, the anti-goddess, the golden shiksa from the provinces who looks cool and together, who looks as if she must have a date on Saturday night, but has only to open her mouth or gulp or dart spastically sideways to reveal herself as the insecure bungler she is, as complete a social disaster in her own way as Allen&#x27;s horny West Side intellectual is in his.&quot; In 2006, &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine ranked Keaton in &quot;Annie Hall&quot; 60th on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Performances of All Time&quot;, and noted:
It&#x27;s hard to play ditzy. ... The genius of Annie is that despite her loopy backhand, awful driving, and nervous tics, she&#x27;s also a complicated, intelligent woman. Keaton brilliantly displays this dichotomy of her character, especially when she yammers away on a first date with Alvy (Woody Allen), while the subtitle reads, &#x27;He probably thinks I&#x27;m a yoyo.&#x27; Yo-yo? Hardly.
Keaton&#x27;s eccentric wardrobe in &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, which consisted mainly of vintage men&#x27;s clothing, including neckties, vests, baggy pants, and fedora hats, made her an unlikely fashion icon of the late 1970s. A small amount of the clothing seen in the film came from Keaton herself, who was already known for her tomboyish clothing style years before &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, and Ruth Morley designed the film&#x27;s costumes. Soon after the film&#x27;s release, men&#x27;s clothing and pantsuits became popular attire for women. She is known to favor men&#x27;s vintage clothing, and usually appears in public wearing gloves and conservative attire. (A 2005 profile in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; described her as &quot;easy to find. Look for the only woman in sight dressed in a turtleneck. On a 90-degree afternoon in Pasadena.&quot;)

Her photo by Douglas Kirkland appeared on the cover of the September 26, 1977, issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, with the story dubbing her &quot;the funniest woman now working in films.&quot; Later that year she departed from her usual lighthearted comic roles when she won the highly coveted lead role in the drama &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot;, based on the novel by Judith Rossner. In the film, she played a Catholic schoolteacher for deaf children who lives a double life, spending nights frequenting singles bars and engaging in promiscuous sex. Keaton became interested in the role after seeing it as a &quot;psychological case history.&quot; The same issue of &quot;Time&quot; commended her role choice and criticized the restricted roles available for female actors in American films: A male actor can fly a plane, fight a war, shoot a badman, pull off a sting, impersonate a big cheese in business or politics. Men are presumed to be interesting. A female can play a wife, play a whore, get pregnant, lose her baby, and, um, let&#x27;s see ... Women are presumed to be dull. ... Now a determined trend spotter can point to a handful of new films whose makers think that women can bear the dramatic weight of a production alone, or virtually so. Then there is Diane Keaton in &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot;. As Theresa Dunn, Keaton dominates this raunchy, risky, violent dramatization of Judith Rossner&#x27;s 1975 novel about a schoolteacher who cruises singles bars.

In addition to acting, Keaton has said she &quot;had a lifelong ambition to be a singer.&quot; She had a brief, unrealized career as a recording artist in the 1970s. Her first record was an original cast recording of &quot;Hair&quot;, in 1971. In 1977 she began recording tracks for a solo album, but the finished record never materialized.

Keaton met with more success in the medium of still photography. Like her character in &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, Keaton had long relished photography as a favorite hobby, an interest she picked up as a teenager from her mother. While traveling in the late 1970s, she began exploring her avocation more seriously. &quot;&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; had asked me to take photographs for them, and I thought, &#x27;Wait a minute, what I&#x27;m really interested in is these lobbies, and these strange ballrooms in these old hotels.&#x27; So I began shooting them&quot;, she recalled in 2003. &quot;These places were deserted, and I could just sneak in anytime and nobody cared. It was so easy and I could do it myself. It was an adventure for me.&quot; &quot;Reservations&quot;, her collection of photos of hotel interiors, was published in book form in 1980.

=== 1980s ===

With &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979), Keaton and Woody Allen ended their long working relationship; it was their last major collaboration until 1993. In 1978, she became romantically involved with Warren Beatty, and two years later he cast her opposite him in the epic historical drama &quot;Reds&quot;. In the film, she played Louise Bryant, a journalist and feminist, who flees her husband to work with radical journalist John Reed (Beatty) and later enters Russia to find him as he chronicles the Russian Civil War. Beatty cast Keaton after seeing her in &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, as he wanted to bring her natural nervousness and insecure attitude to the role. The production of &quot;Reds&quot; was delayed several times following its conception in 1977, and Keaton almost left the project when she believed it would never be produced. Filming finally began two years later. 

In a 2006 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; story, Keaton described her role as &quot;the everyman of that piece, as someone who wanted to be extraordinary but was probably more ordinary ... I knew what it felt like to be extremely insecure.&quot; Assistant director Simon Relph later stated that Louise Bryant was one of Keaton&#x27;s most difficult roles, and that &quot;[she] almost got broken.&quot; &quot;Reds&quot; opened to widespread critical acclaim, and Keaton&#x27;s performance was highly praised in particular. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Keaton was &quot;nothing less than splendid as Louise Bryant– beautiful, selfish, funny and driven. It&#x27;s the best work she has done to date.&quot; Roger Ebert called Keaton &quot;a particular surprise. I had somehow gotten into the habit of expecting her to be a touchy New Yorker, sweet, scared, and intellectual. Here, she is just what she needs to be: plucky, healthy, exasperated, loyal, and funny.&quot; Keaton received her second Academy Award for Best Actress nomination for her performance.

The following year, Keaton starred in the domestic drama &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot; opposite Albert Finney. The film follows George (Finney) and Faith Dunlap (Keaton), whose deteriorating marriage, separation, and love affairs devastate their four children. &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics and Keaton&#x27;s performance was again praised. In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Pauline Kael wrote that the film was &quot;perhaps the most revealing American movie of the era&quot;, and that Keaton &quot;may be a star without vanity: she&#x27;s so completely challenged by the role of Faith that all she cares about is getting the character right. Very few young American movie actresses have the strength and the instinct for the toughest dramatic roles—intelligent, sophisticated heroines. Jane Fonda did, around the time that she appeared in &quot;Klute&quot; and &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot;, but that was more than ten years ago. There hasn&#x27;t been anybody else until now. Diane Keaton acts on a different plane from that of her previous film roles; she brings the character a full measure of dread and awareness and does it in a special, intuitive way that&#x27;s right for screen acting.&quot; David Denby of &quot;New York&quot; magazine called Keaton &quot;perfectly relaxed and self-assured&quot;, adding, &quot;Keaton has always found it easy enough to bring out the anger that lies beneath the soft hesitancy of her surface manner, but she&#x27;s never dug down and found this much pain before. Keaton&#x27;s performance garnered her a second Golden Globe nomination in a row for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, following &quot;Reds&quot;.

1984 brought &quot;The Little Drummer Girl&quot;, Keaton&#x27;s first excursion into the thriller and action genre. &quot;The Little Drummer Girl&quot; was both a financial and critical failure, with critics claiming that Keaton was miscast for the genre, such as one review from &quot;The New Republic&quot; claiming that &quot;the title role, the pivotal role, is played by Diane Keaton, and around her the picture collapses in tatters. She is so feeble, so inappropriate.&quot; But the same year, she received positive reviews for her performance in &quot;Mrs. Soffel&quot;, a film based on the true story of a repressed prison warden&#x27;s wife who falls in love with a convicted murderer and arranges for his escape. Two years later, she starred with Jessica Lange and Sissy Spacek in &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot;, adapted from Beth Henley&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play into a moderately successful screen comedy. Keaton&#x27;s performance was well received by critics, and Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;As the frumpy Lenny, Keaton eases smoothly from New York neurotic to southern eccentric, a reluctant wallflower stymied by, of all things, her shriveled ovary.&quot;

In 1987, Keaton starred in &quot;Baby Boom&quot;, her first of four collaborations with writer-producer Nancy Meyers. She played a Manhattan career woman who is suddenly forced to care for a toddler. A modest box-office success, Keaton&#x27;s performance was singled out by Kael, who described it as &quot;a glorious comedy performance that rides over many of the inanities in this picture. Keaton is smashing: the Tiger Lady&#x27;s having all this drive is played for farce and Keaton keeps you alert to every shade of pride and panic the character feels. She&#x27;s an ultra-feminine executive, a wide-eyed charmer, with a breathless ditziness that may remind you of Jean Arthur in &quot;The More The Merrier&quot;.&quot; That same year, Keaton made a cameo in Allen&#x27;s film &quot;Radio Days&quot; as a nightclub singer. 1988&#x27;s &quot;The Good Mother&quot; was a financial disappointment (according to Keaton, the film was &quot;a Big Failure. Like, BIG failure&quot;), and some critics panned her performance; according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;her acting degenerates into hype—as if she&#x27;s trying to sell an idea she can&#x27;t fully believe in.&quot;

In 1987, Keaton directed and edited her first feature film, &quot;Heaven&quot;, a documentary about the possibility of an afterlife. It met with mixed critical reaction, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; likening it to &quot;a conceit imposed on its subjects.&quot; Over the next four years, Keaton directed music videos for artists such as Belinda Carlisle, including the video for Carlisle&#x27;s chart-topping hit &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth,&quot; two television films starring Patricia Arquette, and episodes of the series &quot;China Beach&quot; and &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
By the 1990s, Keaton had established herself as one of the most popular and versatile actors in Hollywood. She shifted to more mature roles, frequently playing matriarchs of middle-class families. Of her role choices and avoidance of becoming typecast, she said: &quot;Most often a particular role does you some good and Bang! You have loads of offers, all of them for similar roles ... I have tried to break away from the usual roles and have tried my hand at several things.&quot;

Keaton began the decade with &quot;The Lemon Sisters&quot;, a poorly-received comedy-drama that she starred in and produced, which was shelved for a year after its completion. In 1991 she starred with Steve Martin in the family comedy &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;. She was almost not cast in the film, as &quot;The Good Mother&quot;&#x27;s commercial failure had strained her relationship with Walt Disney Pictures, the studio of both films. &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; was Keaton&#x27;s first major hit after four years of commercial disappointments. She reprised her role four years later in the &quot;sequel&quot;, as a woman who becomes pregnant in middle age at the same time as her daughter. A &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; review of the film was one of many in which Keaton was once again compared to Katharine Hepburn: &quot;No longer relying on that stuttering uncertainty that seeped into all her characterizations of the 1970s, she has somehow become Katharine Hepburn with a deep maternal instinct, that is, she is a fine and intelligent actress who doesn&#x27;t need to be tough and edgy in order to prove her feminism.&quot;

Keaton reprised her role of Kay Adams in 1990&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;, set 20 years after the end of &quot;The Godfather, Part II&quot;. In 1993 Keaton starred in black comedy mystery &quot;Manhattan Murder Mystery&quot;, her first major film role in a Woody Allen film since 1979. Her part was originally intended for Mia Farrow, but Farrow dropped out of the project after breaking up with Allen. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; commended her performance, writing that she &quot;nicely handles her sometimes buffoonish central comedic role&quot;. David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote, &quot;On screen, Keaton and Allen have always been made for each other: they still strike wonderfully ditsy sparks&quot;. For her performance, Keaton was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.

In 1995, Keaton directed &quot;Unstrung Heroes&quot;, her first theatrically released narrative film. The film, adapted from Franz Lidz&#x27;s memoir, starred Nathan Watt as a boy in the 1960s whose mother (Andie MacDowell) is diagnosed with cancer. As her sickness advances and his inventor father (John Turturro) grows increasingly distant, the boy is sent to live with his two eccentric uncles (Maury Chaykin and Michael Richards). Keaton switched the story&#x27;s setting from the New York of Lidz&#x27;s book to the Southern California of her own childhood, and the four mad uncles were reduced to a whimsical odd couple. In an essay for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Lidz said that the cinematic Selma had died not of cancer, but of &quot;Old Movie Disease&quot;. &quot;Someday somebody may find a cure for cancer, but the terminal sappiness of cancer movies is probably beyond remedy.&quot; &quot;Unstrung Heroes&quot; played in a relatively limited release and made little impression at the box office, but the film and its direction were generally well-received critically.

Keaton&#x27;s most successful film of the decade was the 1996 comedy &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;. She starred with Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler as a trio of &quot;first wives&quot;: middle-aged women who had been divorced by their husbands in favor of younger women. Keaton claimed that making the film &quot;saved [her] life.&quot; The film was a major success, grossing US$105million at the North American box office, and it developed a cult following among middle-aged women. Its reviews were generally positive for Keaton and her co-stars, and &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called her &quot;probably [one of] the best comic film actresses alive.&quot; In 1997 Keaton, Hawn and Midler received the Women in Film Crystal Award, which honors &quot;outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.&quot;

Also in 1996, Keaton starred as Bessie, a woman with leukemia, in &quot;Marvin&#x27;s Room&quot;, an adaptation of the play by Scott McPherson. Meryl Streep played her estranged sister, Lee, and had also initially been considered for the role of Bessie. The film also starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Lee&#x27;s rebellious son. Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;Streep and Keaton, in their different styles, find ways to make Lee and Bessie into much more than the expression of their problems.&quot; Keaton earned a third Academy Award nomination for the film, which was critically acclaimed. She said the role&#x27;s biggest challenge was understanding the mentality of a person with a terminal illness. Keaton next starred in &quot;The Only Thrill&quot; (1997) opposite her &quot;Baby Boom&quot; co-star Sam Shephard, and had a supporting role in &quot;The Other Sister&quot; (1999).

In 1999, Keaton narrated the one-hour public radio documentary &quot;If I Get Out Alive&quot;, the first to focus on the conditions and brutality young people face in the adult correctional system. The program, produced by Lichtenstein Creative Media, aired on public radio stations across the country and was honored with a First Place National Headliner Award and a Casey Medal for Meritorious Journalism.

=== 2000s ===
Keaton&#x27;s first film of 2000 was &quot;Hanging Up&quot;, with Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow. She directed the film, despite claiming in a 1996 interview that she would never direct herself in a film, saying &quot;as a director, you automatically have different goals. I can&#x27;t think about directing when I&#x27;m acting.&quot; A drama about three sisters coping with the senility and eventual death of their elderly father (Walter Matthau), &quot;Hanging Up&quot; rated poorly with critics and grossed a modest US$36million at the North American box office.

In 2001, Keaton co-starred with Beatty in &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot;, a critical and financial fiasco. Budgeted at an estimated US$90million, the film opened to little notice and grossed only US$7million in its North American theatrical run. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; was &quot;less deserving of a review than it is an obituary...The corpse took with it the reputations of its starry cast, including Beatty and Keaton.&quot; In 2001 and 2002, Keaton starred in four low-budget television films. She played a fanatical nun in the religious drama &quot;Sister Mary Explains It All&quot;, an impoverished mother in the drama &quot;On Thin Ice&quot;, and a bookkeeper in the mob comedy &quot;Plan B&quot;. In &quot;Crossed Over&quot;, she played Beverly Lowry, a woman who forms an unusual friendship with the only woman executed while on death row in Texas, Karla Faye Tucker.

Keaton&#x27;s first major hit since 1996 came in 2003&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot;, directed by Nancy Meyers and co-starring Jack Nicholson. Nicholson and Keaton, aged 65 and 56 respectively, were seen as bold casting choices for leads in a romantic comedy. Twentieth Century Fox, the film&#x27;s original studio, reportedly declined to produce the film, fearing that the lead characters were too old to be bankable. Keaton told &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s face it, people my age and Jack&#x27;s age are much deeper, much more soulful, because they&#x27;ve seen a lot of life. They have a great deal of passion and hope—why shouldn&#x27;t they fall in love? Why shouldn&#x27;t movies show that?&quot; Keaton played a middle-aged playwright who falls in love with her daughter&#x27;s much older boyfriend. The film was a major success at the box office, grossing US$125million in North America. Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;Keaton and Nicholson bring so much experience, knowledge and humor to their characters that the film works in ways the screenplay might not have even hoped for.&quot; Keaton received her fourth Academy Award nomination for her performance.

Keaton&#x27;s only film between 2004 and 2006 was the comedy &quot;The Family Stone&quot; (2005), starring an ensemble cast. In the film, scripted and directed by Thomas Bezucha, Keaton played a breast cancer survivor and matriarch of a big New England family that reunites at the parents&#x27; home for its annual Christmas holidays. The film released to moderate critical and commercial success, and earned US$92.2million worldwide. Keaton received her second Satellite Award nomination for her performance, of which Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;Keaton, a sorceress at blending humor and heartbreak, honors the film with a grace that makes it stick in the memory.&quot;

In 2007, Keaton starred in both &quot;Because I Said So&quot; and &quot;Mama&#x27;s Boy&quot;. In the romantic comedy &quot;Because I Said So&quot;, directed by Michael Lehmann, Keaton played a long-divorced mother of three daughters, determined to pair off her only single daughter, Milly (Mandy Moore). Also starring Stephen Collins and Gabriel Macht, the project opened to overwhelmingly negative reviews, with Wesley Morris of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; calling it &quot;a sloppily made bowl of reheated chick-flick cliches&quot;, and was ranked among the worst-reviewed films of the year. The following year Keaton received her first and only Golden Raspberry Award nomination to date for the film. In &quot;Mama&#x27;s Boy&quot;, director Tim Hamilton&#x27;s feature film debut, Keaton starred as the mother of a self-absorbed 29-year-old (Jon Heder) whose world turns upside down when she starts dating and considers kicking him out of the house. Distributed for a limited release to certain parts of the United States only, the independent comedy garnered largely negative reviews.

In 2008, Keaton starred alongside Dax Shepard and Liv Tyler in Vince Di Meglio&#x27;s dramedy &quot;Smother&quot;, playing the overbearing mother of an unemployed therapist, who decides to move in with him and his girlfriend after breaking up with her husband (Ken Howard). As with &quot;Mama&#x27;s Boy&quot;, the film received a limited release only, resulting in a gross of US$1.8million worldwide. Critical reaction to the film was generally unfavorable. Also in 2008, Keaton appeared alongside Katie Holmes and Queen Latifah in the crime-comedy film &quot;Mad Money&quot;, directed by Callie Khouri. Based on the British television drama &quot;Hot Money&quot; (2001), the film revolves around three female employees of the Federal Reserve who scheme to steal money that is about to be destroyed.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, Keaton starred alongside Rachel McAdams and Harrison Ford in Roger Michell&#x27;s comedy &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, playing the veteran TV host of a fictional morning talk show that desperately needs to boost its lagging ratings. Portraying a narcissistic character who will do anything to please the audience, Keaton described her role as &quot;the kind of woman you love to hate.&quot; Inspired by Neil Simon&#x27;s 1972 Broadway play &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot;, the film was a moderate success at the box office, taking a worldwide total of almost US$59million. Keaton was generally praised for her performance, with James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; writing, &quot;Keaton is so good at her part that one can see her sliding effortlessly into an anchor&#x27;s chair on a real morning show.&quot;
In fall 2010, Keaton joined the production of the comedy-drama &quot;Darling Companion&quot; by Lawrence Kasdan, which was released in 2012. Co-starring Kevin Kline and Dianne Wiest and set in Telluride, Colorado, the film follows a woman, played by Keaton, whose husband loses her much-beloved dog at a wedding held at their vacation home in the Rocky Mountains, resulting in a search party to find the pet. Kasdan&#x27;s first film in nine years, the film bombed at the US box office, where it scored about US$790,000 throughout its entire theatrical run. Critics dismissed the film as &quot;an overwritten, underplotted vanity project&quot; but applauded Keaton&#x27;s performance. Ty Burr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that the film &quot;would be instantly forgettable if not for Keaton, who imbues [her role] with a sorrow, warmth, wisdom, and rage that feel earned [...] Her performance here is an extension of worn, resilient grace.&quot;

Also in 2011, Keaton began production on Justin Zackham&#x27;s 2013 ensemble family comedy &quot;The Big Wedding&quot;, a remake of the 2006 French film &quot;Mon frère se marie&quot; in which she, along with Robert De Niro, played a long-divorced couple who, for the sake of their adopted son&#x27;s wedding and his very religious biological mother, pretend they are still married. The film received largely negative reviews.

In 2014, Keaton starred in &quot;And So It Goes&quot; and &quot;5 Flights Up&quot;. In Rob Reiner&#x27;s romantic dramedy &quot;And So It Goes&quot;, Keaton portrayed a widowed lounge singer who finds autumnal love with a bad boy (Michael Douglas). The film received largely negative reviews. One critic wrote that &quot;&quot;And So It Goes&quot; aims for comedy, but with two talented actors stuck in a half-hearted effort from a once-mighty filmmaker, it ends in unintentional tragedy.&quot; Keaton co-starred with Morgan Freeman in Richard Loncraine&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;5 Flights Up&quot;, based on Jill Ciment&#x27;s novel &quot;Heroic Measures&quot;. They play a long-married couple who have an eventful weekend after they are forced to contemplate selling their beloved Brooklyn apartment. Shot in New York, the film premiered, under its former name &quot;Ruth &amp; Alex&quot;, at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. The same year Keaton became the first woman to receive the Golden Lion Award at the Zurich Film Festival.

Keaton&#x27;s only film of 2015 was &quot;Love the Coopers&quot;, an ensemble comedy about a troubled family getting together for Christmas, for which she reunited with &quot;Because I Said So&quot; writer Jessie Nelson. Also starring John Goodman, Ed Helms, and Marisa Tomei, Keaton was attached for several years before the film went into production. Her casting was instrumental in financing and recruiting most other actors, which led her to an executive producer credit in the film. &quot;Love the Coopers&quot; received largely negative reviews from critics, who called it a &quot;bittersweet blend of holiday cheer&quot;, and became a moderate commercial success at a worldwide total of US$41.1million against a budget of US$17million. Also in 2015 Netflix announced the comedy &quot;Divanation&quot;, for which Keaton was expected to reunite with her &quot;First Wives Club&quot; co-stars Midler and Hawn to portray a former singing group, but the project failed to materialize.

Keaton voiced amnesiac fish Dory&#x27;s mother in Disney and Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Finding Dory&quot; (2016), the sequel to the 2003 Pixar animated film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over US$1billion worldwide, the second Pixar film to cross this mark after &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010). It also set numerous records, including the biggest animated opening of all time in North America, emerging as the biggest animated film of all time in the US. Keaton&#x27;s other project of 2016 was the HBO eight-part series &quot;The Young Pope&quot;, in which she plays a nun who raised the newly elected Pope (Jude Law) and helped him reach the papacy. The miniseries received two nominations for the 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first Italian TV series to be nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards.

In 2017, Keaton appeared opposite Brendan Gleeson in the British dramedy film &quot;Hampstead&quot;. Based on the life of Harry Hallowes, it depicts an American widow (Keaton) who helps a local man defending his ramshackle hut and the life he has been leading on Hampstead Heath for 17 years. The specialty release had a mixed reception from critics, who were unimpressed by the film&#x27;s &quot;deeply mediocre story&quot;, but became a minor commercial success. Keaton&#x27;s only project of 2018 was &quot;Book Club&quot;, in which she, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen play four friends who read &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; as part of their monthly book club and subsequently begin to change how they view their personal relationships. The romantic comedy received mixed reviews from critics, who felt that &quot;Book Club&quot; only &quot;intermittently rises to the level of its impressive veteran cast,&quot; but with a worldwide gross of over $100 million, became Keaton&#x27;s biggest commercial success in a non-voice role since 2003&#x27;s &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot;. In 2019, Keaton starred in the comedy &quot;Poms&quot; as a woman dying of cancer who starts a cheerleading squad with other female residents of a retirement home. The film was a box office disappointment and was negatively received by critics.

== Personal life ==

=== Relationships and family ===
Keaton has had romantic associations with several entertainment industry personalities, starting with director Woody Allen during her role in the 1969 Broadway production of &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot;. Their relationship turned romantic following a dinner after a late-night rehearsal. It was her sense of humor that attracted Allen. They briefly lived together during the production, but by the time of the film release of the same name in 1972, their living arrangement became informal. They worked together on eight films between 1971 and 1993, and Keaton has said that Allen remains one of her closest friends.

Keaton also had a relationship with her &quot;Godfather Trilogy&quot; costar Al Pacino. Their on-again, off-again relationship ended after the filming of &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;. Keaton said of Pacino, &quot;Al was simply the most entertaining man... To me, that&#x27;s, that is the most beautiful face. I think Warren [Beatty] was gorgeous, very pretty, but Al&#x27;s face is like whoa. Killer, killer face.&quot;

Keaton was already dating Warren Beatty in 1979 when they co-starred in the film &quot;Reds&quot; (1981). Beatty was a regular subject in tabloid magazines and media coverage, and Keaton became included, much to her bewilderment. In 1985, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; called her &quot;the most reclusive star since Garbo.&quot; This relationship ended shortly after &quot;Reds&quot; wrapped. Troubles with the production are thought to have strained the relationship, including numerous financial and scheduling problems. Keaton remains friends with Beatty.

In July 2001, Keaton said of being older and unmarried, &quot;I don&#x27;t think that because I&#x27;m not married it&#x27;s made my life any less. That old maid myth is garbage.&quot; Keaton has two adopted children, daughter Dexter (adopted 1996) and son Duke (adopted 2001). Her father&#x27;s death made mortality more apparent to her, and she decided to become a mother at age 50. She later said of having children, &quot;Motherhood has completely changed me. It&#x27;s just about like the most completely humbling experience that I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot;

=== Religious beliefs ===
Keaton said she produced her 1987 documentary &quot;Heaven&quot; because &quot;I was always pretty religious as a kid ... I was primarily interested in religion because I wanted to go to heaven.&quot; When she grew up, she became agnostic.

=== Other activities ===

Keaton has been a vegetarian since around 1995. She has continued to pursue photography. In 1987, she told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;I have amassed a huge library of images—kissing scenes from movies, pictures I like. Visual things are really key for me.&quot; She has published several collections of her photographs and served as an editor of collections of vintage photography. Works she has edited include a book of photographs by paparazzo Ron Galella, an anthology of reproductions of clown paintings, and a collection of photos of California&#x27;s Spanish-Colonial-style houses.

Keaton has served as a producer on films and television series. She produced the Fox series &quot;Pasadena&quot;, which was canceled after airing only four episodes in 2001 but completed its run on cable in 2005. In 2003, she produced the Gus Van Sant drama &quot;Elephant&quot;, about a school shooting. Of why she produced the film, she said, &quot;It really makes me think about my responsibilities as an adult to try and understand what&#x27;s going on with young people.&quot;

Since 2005, Keaton has been a contributing blogger at &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. Since 2006, she has been the face of L&#x27;Oréal. In 2007, Keaton received the Film Society of Lincoln Center&#x27;s Gala Tribute. She opposes plastic surgery. She told &quot;More&quot; magazine in 2004, &quot;I&#x27;m stuck in this idea that I need to be authentic ... My face needs to look the way I feel.&quot;

Keaton is active in campaigns with the Los Angeles Conservancy to save and restore historic buildings, particularly in the Los Angeles area. Among the buildings she has been active in restoring is the Ennis House in the Hollywood Hills, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Keaton was also active in the failed campaign to save the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles (a hotel featured in &quot;Reservations&quot;), where Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated. She is an enthusiast of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture.

Keaton has also been a real estate developer. She has resold several mansions in Southern California after renovating and redesigning them. One of her clients was Madonna, who purchased a $6.5million Beverly Hills mansion from Keaton in 2003.

Keaton wrote her first memoir, &quot;Then Again&quot;, for Random House in November 2011. Much of it relies on her mother&#x27;s private journals, which include the line &quot;Diane...is a mystery...At times, she&#x27;s so basic, at others so wise, it frightens me.&quot; In 2012, Keaton&#x27;s audiobook recording of Joan Didion&#x27;s &quot;Slouching Towards Bethlehem&quot; was released on Audible.com. Her performance was nominated for a 2013 Audie Award in the Short Stories/Collections category.

== Acting style and legacy ==
Keaton has been called &quot;one of the great American actresses from the heyday of the 1970s&quot;, a style icon and a &quot;treasure&quot; with a personal and professional style that is &quot;difficult to explicate and impossible to duplicate.&quot; Many critics have pointed to her versatility in starring in both light comedies and acclaimed dramas. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Keaton as &quot;remarkably skilled&quot; at portraying Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;darling flustered muse&quot; in his comedies, as well as &quot;shy, self-conscious women overcome by the power of their own awakened eroticism&quot; in dramatic films like &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot;, &quot;Reds&quot;, &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Soffel&quot;. It also noted Keaton&#x27;s ability to consistently reinvent and challenge herself on screen, having transitioned from &quot;Allen&#x27;s ditzy foil&quot; to a &quot;gifted and erotically nuanced character actress&quot; and later &quot;an appealing maternal figure... a woman&#x27;s woman with a sexy edge.&quot;

Literary critic Daphne Merkin argued that Keaton remained more popular with audiences than her contemporaries because of her &quot;friendly accessibility&quot; and &quot;charmingly self-effacing&quot; persona, calling Keaton&#x27;s most &quot;steadfastly glamorous&quot; asset her &quot;megawatt personality, bursting out of her like an uncontrollable force of nature, a geyser of quirkily entertaining traits that fall on the air and lend everything around her a momentary sparkle.&quot; In &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Peter Rainer wrote, &quot;In her &quot;Annie Hall&quot; days, [Keaton] was famed for her thrown-together fashion sense, and her approach to acting is, in the best way, thrown-together, too. Audiences love her because they identify with the women she plays, who are never all of a piece. Nobody can be grave and goofy all at once like Diane Keaton. In these fractious times, it&#x27;s the perfect combo for a modern heroine.&quot; Famously self-deprecating, Keaton has been noted for her &quot;wry sense of humor&quot; and &quot;eccentric gender-bending style.&quot;

Analyzing her on-screen persona, Deborah C. Mitchell wrote that Keaton often played &quot;a complex, modern American woman, a paradox of self-doubt and assurance&quot;, which became her trademark. Mitchell suggests that Keaton made &quot;Annie Hall&quot; a &quot;critical juncture for women in American culture. In this ism-infected age, Keaton became not just a star but an icon. Annie Hall, and with her Diane Keaton, presented all of the uncertainty and ambivalence of the new breed of women.&quot; Likewise, Bruce Weber felt Keaton&#x27;s eccentricity—&quot;an amalgam of caginess and insecurity&quot; and a &quot;note of comic desperation... her round-cheeked Annie Hall dewiness&quot;—was her gift as a screen comedian. Keaton&#x27;s Annie Hall is often cited among the greatest Oscar-winning performances in history: &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it 7th on its &quot;25 greatest Best Actress Winners&quot; list, praising her &quot;loopy mannerisms, jazz-club serenades, and endlessly imitated fashion sense.&quot; After seeing her performance in &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot;, Andrew Sarris remarked, &quot;Keaton is clearly the most dynamic woman star in pictures. And any actress who can bring wit and humor to sex in an American movie has to be blessed with the most winning magic.&quot;

When asked what made Keaton funny, Allen said: &quot;My opinion is that with the exception of Judy Holliday, she&#x27;s the finest screen comedienne we&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s in her intonation; you can&#x27;t quantify it easily. When Groucho Marx or W.C. Fields or Holliday would say something, it&#x27;s in the ring of their voices, and she has that. It&#x27;s never line comedy with her. It&#x27;s all character comedy.&quot; Charles Shyer, who directed her in &quot;Baby Boom&quot;, said Keaton was &quot;in the mold of the iconic comedic actresses Carole Lombard, Irene Dunne and Rosalind Russell.&quot; In 2017 Keaton was chosen by the board of directors of the American Film Institute to receive the AFI Life Achievement Award, which Woody Allen presented.

<text>USS &quot;Princeton&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-37, LPH-5) was one of 24 s built during and shortly after World War II for the United States Navy. The ship was the fifth US Navy ship to bear the name, and was named for the Revolutionary War Battle of Princeton. &quot;Princeton&quot; was commissioned in November 1945, too late to serve in World War II, but saw extensive service in the Korean War, in which she earned eight battle stars, and the Vietnam War. She was reclassified in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), then as an Antisubmarine Aircraft Carrier (CVS), and finally as an amphibious assault ship (LPH), carrying helicopters and marines. One of her last missions was to serve as the prime recovery ship for the Apollo 10 space mission.

Although she was extensively modified internally as part of her conversion to an LPH, external modifications were minor, so throughout her career &quot;Princeton&quot; retained the classic appearance of a World War II &quot;Essex&quot;-class ship. She was decommissioned in 1970, and sold for scrap in September 1972.

==Service history==
The ship was laid down as &quot;Valley Forge&quot; – one of the &quot;long-hull&quot; &quot;Essex&quot; class – on 14 September 1943 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She was renamed &quot;Princeton&quot; on 21 November 1944 to commemorate the light carrier , which was lost at the Battle of Leyte Gulf on 24 October 1944. The new &quot;Princeton&quot; was launched on 8 July 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Harold Dodds, and commissioned on 18 November 1945, Captain John M. Hoskins in command.

Following shakedown off Cuba, &quot;Princeton&quot; — with Air Group 81 embarked – remained in the Atlantic and operated with the 8th Fleet until June 1946.

Then transferred to the Pacific Fleet, she arrived at San Diego, departing again on 3 July 1946 to carry the body of Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon back to Manila for burial. From Manila, &quot;Princeton&quot; joined the 7th Fleet in the Marianas, becoming flagship of Task Force 77 (TF 77). In September and October 1946, she operated in Japanese and Chinese waters, then returned to the Mariana Islands where she remained until February 1947. In 1947 she had Carrier Air Group 13 on board, and in October 1948 evacuated dependents from Qingdao, returned to San Diego Dec 1948 and unloaded CAG 13. Maneuvers in Hawaiian waters preceded her return to San Diego until 15 March. She cruised the West Coast, Hawaiian waters, and the Western Pacific (1 October – 23 December) in 1948. She then prepared for inactivation, and on 20 June decommissioned and joined other capital ships in the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

===Korean War===
Reactivated with the outbreak of hostilities in Korea 15 months later, &quot;Princeton&quot; recommissioned on 28 August 1950. Intensive training refreshed her Reservist crew. On 5 December she joined TF 77 off the Korean coast, her planes and pilots (Air Group 19) making possible the reinstitution of jet combat air patrols over the battle zone. She launched 248 sorties against targets in the Hagaru area to announce her arrival. For the next six days she continued the pace, supporting Marines retreating from the Chosin Reservoir to Hungnam. By the 11th, all units had reached the staging area on the coast. &quot;Princeton&quot;″s planes, with other Navy, Marine, and Air Force squadrons, then covered the evacuation from Hungnam through its completion on the 24th.

Interdiction missions followed, and by 4 April &quot;Princeton&quot;″s planes had rendered 54 rail and 37 highway bridges inoperable and damaged 44 more. In May, they flew against the railroad bridges connecting Pyongyang with Sunchon, Sinanju, Kachon, and the trans-peninsula line. Next, they combined close air support with raids on power sources in the Hwachon Reservoir area and, with the stabilization of the front there, resumed interdiction. For much of the summer they pounded supply arteries, concentrating on highways. &quot;Princeton&quot; then returned to the US, arriving at San Diego on 29 August.

During 1952, scenes for the movie &quot;Flat Top&quot; were filmed aboard the ship, as acknowledged in the movie.

On 30 April 1952, &quot;Princeton&quot; rejoined TF 77 in the combat zone. For 138 days, her planes flew against the enemy. They sank small craft to prevent the recapture of offshore islands; blasted concentrations of supplies, facilities, and equipment behind enemy lines, participated in air-gun strikes on coastal cities, pounded the enemy&#x27;s hydroelectric complex at Suiho on the Yalu River to turn off power on both sides of that river, destroyed gun positions and supply areas in Pyongyang; and closed mineral processing plants and munitions factories at Sindok, Musan, Aoji, and Najin.

Reclassified &quot;CVA-37&quot; (1 October 1952), &quot;Princeton&quot; returned to California on 3 November for a two-month respite from the western Pacific. In February 1953, she was back off the Korean coast and until the end of the conflict launched planes for close air support, for &quot;Cherokee&quot; strikes against supply, artillery, and troop concentrations in enemy territory, and against road traffic. She remained in the area after the truce on 27 July, and on 7 September got underway for San Diego.

===1954–1962===
In January 1954, &quot;Princeton&quot; was reclassified CVS-37 and, after conversion at Bremerton, Washington, took up antisubmarine/ Hunter-Killer (HUK) training operations in the eastern Pacific. For the next five years she alternated HUK exercises off the West Coast with similar operations in the western Pacific and, in late 1957-early 1958, in the Indian Ocean–Persian Gulf area.

Reclassified again, 2 March 1959, she emerged from conversion as an amphibious assault carrier, LPH-5. Capable of transporting a battalion landing team and carrying helicopters in place of planes, &quot;Princeton&quot;″s mission became that of vertical envelopment—the landing of Marines behind enemy beach fortifications and providing logistics and medical support as they attack from the rear to seize critical points, cut enemy supplies, sever communications, and link up with assault forces landed on the beaches. Since this was a Marine Corps mission, Marines made up a major portion of the ship&#x27;s company in the Air, Operations, and Supply Departments.

From May 1959 – January 1960, &quot;Princeton&quot; trained with Marine units from Camp Pendleton, then deployed to WestPac to train in Okinawan waters.

For the next three years, she followed a similar schedule, gaining experience in her primary mission. Interruptions came in October 1961 when she rescued 74 survivors of two merchantmen &quot;Pioneer Muse&quot; and &quot;Sheik&quot; grounded on Kita Daito Shima and in April 1962 when she delivered Marine Corps advisors and helicopters to Sóc Trăng in the Mekong Delta area of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). From September–November 1962, &quot;Princeton&quot; served as flagship of Joint Task Force 8 during the nuclear weapons test series, Operation Dominic.

===Vietnam War===

In October 1964, &quot;Princeton&quot; exchanged WestPac training for the real thing as she returned to Vietnam and joined the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s Ready Group in operations against North Vietnamese and Viet Cong (VC) forces. Combat operations, interrupted in November for flood relief work, continued into the new year, 1965, and culminated in May off Chu Lai as she carried out her primary mission, vertical envelopment, for the first time in combat.

Returning to her homeport, Long Beach, California, &quot;Princeton&quot; visited San Francisco, Puget Sound, and Hawaii as part of the 1965 Pacific Midshipman Training Squadron. She then transported Marine Aircraft Group 36 to Vietnam in August, and in February 1966 got underway for another tour in the combat zone. Relieving as flagship for the Amphibious Ready Group, she engaged the enemy in operations Jackstay, 26 March – 6 April, to clear the Rung Sat Special Zone of Viet Cong guerrillas, and Osage, 27 April – 4 May, to protect Vietnamese in the Phu Loc area from VC harassment.
Search and destroy missions against Viet Cong and People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam units followed as &quot;Princeton&quot; provided transportation, medical evacuation, logistics and communication support for the amphibious operation Deckhouse I, 18 – 27 June, in the Song Cau district and the Song Cai river valley, then supported 1st Cavalry and 101st Airborne units engaged in Operation Nathan Hale to the south of the Deckhouse I area. Operation Deckhouse II and support for Operation Hastings followed as Navy, Marine, and Army units again combined, this time to impede enemy infiltration from the DMZ.

After Operation Hastings, &quot;Princeton&quot; sailed for home, arriving on 2 September. She deployed again to Vietnam from 30 January – 19 June 1967, and again ranged along the coast. In March, she assisted in countering an enemy threat to the Marine artillery base at Gio Linh and evacuated wounded from Con Thien. In April, she participated in Operation Beacon Star, in the Khe Sanh area, and supported search and destroy operations in conjunction with Operation Shawnee. In May, her helicopters lifted Marines to the DMZ to block enemy forces withdrawing across the Bến Hải River.

A much-needed overhaul followed &quot;Princeton&quot;″s return to the west coast, and in May 1968 she again sailed west to Vietnam. There, as flagship for Amphibious Ready Group Alpha, she provided amphibious assault carrier services for operations Fortress Attack III and IV, Proud Hunter, Swift Pursuit, and Eager Hunter. In December, she returned to the United States. 

===Later career===
In April 1969 she was designated the prime recovery ship for Apollo 10, the lunar mission which paved the way for Apollo 11 and the first crewed landing on the Moon. Apollo 10, carrying astronauts Eugene Cernan, John Young, and Thomas P. Stafford, was recovered in the South Pacific on 26 May.

On 30 January 1970, &quot;Princeton&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register, and sold for scrapping to Zidell Explorations Inc., Portland in September 1972 by Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service.

After the ship was sold for scrapping, some of the steel deck plate was acquired by Fermilab in 1972 for use in its experimental areas. In 1978, Robert R. Wilson used portions of that steel to create the &quot;Broken Symmetry&quot; sculpture that stands over one of the laboratory&#x27;s gates.

<text>Voodoo is the second studio album by the American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist D&#x27;Angelo, released on January 25, 2000, through Virgin Records. D&#x27;Angelo recorded the album during 1997 and 1999 at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, with an extensive line-up of musicians associated with the Soulquarians musical collective. Produced primarily by the singer, &quot;Voodoo&quot; features a loose, groove-based funk sound and serves as a departure from the more conventional song structure of his debut album, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; (1995). Its lyrics explore themes of spirituality, love, sexuality, maturation, and fatherhood.

Following heavy promotion and public anticipation, the album was met with commercial and critical success. It debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 320,000 copies in its first week, and spent 33 weeks on the chart. It was promoted with five singles, including the hit single &quot;Untitled (How Does It Feel)&quot;, whose music video garnered D&#x27;Angelo mainstream attention and controversy. Upon its release, &quot;Voodoo&quot; received general acclaim from music critics and earned D&#x27;Angelo several accolades. It was named one of the year&#x27;s best albums by numerous publications.

D&#x27;Angelo promoted &quot;Voodoo&quot; with an international supporting tour in late 2000. While successful early on, the tour became plagued by concert cancellations and D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s personal frustrations surrounding his sexualized public image from the album&#x27;s marketing. &quot;Voodoo&quot; has since been regarded by music writers as a creative milestone of the neo soul genre during its apex and has sold more than 1.7 million copies in the United States, being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

== Background ==

Following the success of his debut album &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; (1995), D&#x27;Angelo went into a four-and-a-half-year absence from the music scene and releasing solo work. His debut album presented a musical fusion of traditional soul and R&amp;B influences with hip hop vocal and production elements, serving as fundamental elements for the neo soul sound. With its single-oriented success, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; earned considerable sales success and defied the contemporary, producer-driven sound of the time, while earning popularity among mature R&amp;B audiences and the growing hip hop generation. Prior to its release, neo soul itself was undefined by a major artist or musical work, and was developing during the early 1990s through the work of artists such as Tony! Toni! Toné!, Me&#x27;Shell NdegéOcello, and Omar. The album also earned D&#x27;Angelo recognition for producing a commercial breakthrough for the genre and giving notice to other neo soul artists, including Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell.

After spending two years on tour promoting &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, D&#x27;Angelo found himself stuck with writer&#x27;s block. On the setback, D&#x27;Angelo later stated &quot;The thing about writer&#x27;s block is that you want to write so fucking bad, [but] the songs don&#x27;t come out that way. They come from life. So you&#x27;ve got to live to write.&quot; During this time, he generally released cover versions and remakes, including a cover-collaboration with Erykah Badu of the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell duet song &quot;Your Precious Love&quot; for the soundtrack to &quot;High School High&quot; (1996). D&#x27;Angelo also covered Prince&#x27;s &quot;She&#x27;s Always in My Hair&quot; for the &quot;Scream 2&quot; soundtrack (1997), as well as the Ohio Players&#x27; &quot;Heaven Must Be Like This&quot; for the &quot;Down in the Delta&quot; soundtrack (1998). He also appeared on a duet, &quot;Nothing Even Matters&quot;, with Lauryn Hill for her debut solo album &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; (1998). He also spent the time lifting weights, smoking marijuana, and making music.

=== Inspiration ===
In 1998, he was inspired to write music again after the birth of his first child, Michael, with fellow R&amp;B singer and then-girlfriend Angie Stone. He also traveled back to the South, spending time in South Carolina and in his hometown of Richmond, Virginia, while reconnecting himself with the African-American musical history that had originally inspired him. Shortly after his son&#x27;s birth and the release of his first live album &quot;Live at the Jazz Cafe&quot; (1998) through EMI Records, he began preparation for the recording of songs for &quot;Voodoo&quot;. In several interviews after its release, he cited his son&#x27;s birth as an inspirational source and creative muse for him. A dedication to his son Michael and daughter Imani was included in the album&#x27;s liner notes, which were co-written by D&#x27;Angelo and writer/musician Saul Williams. In a press video accompanying the release of &quot;Voodoo&quot;, D&#x27;Angelo suggested that he was attempting to create a new sound for him that was in transition: &quot;My inspiration was just to go farther. To get to that next level. To push it even further. To work against the floss and the grain and to get even deeper into the sound that I&#x27;m hearing ... and the thing is, I&#x27;m just looking at &quot;Voodoo&quot; as just the beginning. I&#x27;m still developing and growing and still listening to that sound I hear inside my head ... So this is the first step&quot;.

In a February 1999 interview with music journalist Touré, D&#x27;Angelo discussed the album and elaborated on the events that had preceded its release, explaining how he had no initial plan for a follow-up. He also discussed his attempt to focus on his original inspiration to produce music, stating &quot;The sound and feel of my music are going to be affected by what motivates me to do it&quot;. On his visit to South Carolina, D&#x27;Angelo stated that he &quot;went through this runnel, through gospel, blues, and a lot of old soul, old James Brown, early, early Sly and the Family Stone, and a lot of Jimi Hendrix&quot;, and &quot;I learned a lot about music, myself, and where I want to go musically&quot;. In the same interview, he cited the deaths of rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. as having a great effect on him during the period. In another interview with Touré, D&#x27;Angelo said that he had lost his enthusiasm after &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;″s reception and &quot;was gettin&#x27; jaded, lookin&#x27; at what go on in the business&quot;. On his purpose for returning, D&#x27;Angelo stated &quot;I had to reiterate why I was doin&#x27; that in the first place, and the reason was the love for the music&quot;. Dissatisfied with the direction of R&amp;B and soul upon making the album, D&#x27;Angelo later explained to &quot;Jet&quot; that &quot;the term R&amp;B doesn&#x27;t mean what it used to mean. R&amp;B is pop, that&#x27;s the new word for R&amp;B.&quot; He also found contemporary R&amp;B to be &quot;a joke&quot;, adding that &quot;the funny thing about it is that the people making this shit are dead serious about the stuff they&#x27;re making. It&#x27;s sad—they&#x27;ve turned black music into a club thing.&quot; In the liner notes for &quot;Voodoo&quot;, Saul Williams examined the album&#x27;s concept and echoes D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R&amp;B/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for &quot;Ebony&quot;, D&#x27;Angelo said of his role and influences for &quot;Voodoo&quot;:

== Recording and production ==
Beginning in 1996, &quot;Voodoo&quot; evolved from nearly four years of sessions and featured an extensive roster of R&amp;B, hip hop, and jazz musicians and recording technicians. Drummer and producer Ahmir &quot;Questlove&quot; Thompson of The Roots was D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s &quot;co-pilot&quot; during the session. He and his crew studied bootleg videotapes of classic R&amp;B artists such as Marvin Gaye, James Brown, and Jimi Hendrix, along with reruns of &quot;Soul Train&quot;, at Electric Lady Studios, the Manhattan-based recording studio built by Jimi Hendrix. After watching a tape, they played a certain artist&#x27;s album or catalog, jam, and recorded for inspiration. Touré of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; observed, &quot;One night they played Prince&#x27;s &quot;Parade&quot; until they flowed into a new groove that became &#x27;Africa&#x27;&quot;. On several occasions, D&#x27;Angelo listened to Sly &amp; the Family Stone&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; (1971), which had an influential production. The crew recorded numerous hours of unreleased, original material, as well as covers of their influencers&#x27; material. Collectively referred to by D&#x27;Angelo as &quot;yoda&quot;, these influencers included soul artist Al Green, funk artist George Clinton, and Afrobeat artist Fela Kuti.

During the initial recording sessions, D&#x27;Angelo also worked with personal trainer Mark Jenkins, who was hired to help him get into shape. As Questlove recounted, &quot;Money was definitely overweight by &#x27;96, so they got him a drill sergeant physical trainer Mark Jenkins. This guy didn&#x27;t take no shit. I cannot see D running in Central Park, but he did [...] Push-ups, weight room, sparring every day for three hours. He wouldn&#x27;t take no shit.&quot;

Following the birth of his son, D&#x27;Angelo composed the album&#x27;s first song &quot;Send It On&quot; in 1998 at a recording studio in Virginia. Shortly afterwards, he felt ready to begin the recording for &quot;Voodoo&quot;. D&#x27;Angelo wrote most of &quot;Voodoo&quot;″s material at Electric Lady Studios, as opposed to his method of composing outside the studio as he did for &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;. Recording sessions for what ended up on the album began in 1998 and continued through to 1999. On the sessions&#x27; environment, Touré wrote &quot;What started as the follow-up to D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s 1995 platinum debut, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, became five years of study at Soul University, complete with classes, pranks, gossip and equal amounts of discipline and laziness.&quot; D&#x27;Angelo and Questlove have compared the environment to school. Music writer Trevor Schoonmaker examined D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s and Questlove&#x27;s initial recording approach, stating &quot;In the endless sessions for the record, the two spent hours trying to conjure the elusive &#x27;vibe&#x27; necessary to provoke the album&#x27;s creation, which included listening to hours of black music that escaped strict classification. Some of that found itself played out in ghostly ways on &quot;Voodoo&quot;.&quot;

=== Soulquarians and guests ===

Production for the album was conducted in a generally informal manner and took place at Electric Lady Studios simultaneously with recording for Erykah Badu&#x27;s &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; (2000) and Common&#x27;s &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; (2000). This led to impromptu collaborations and a distinctive sound that is featured on the three albums. Frequent visits to the studio were made by fellow neo soul and hip hop recording artists associated with the Soulquarians collective such as Erykah Badu, Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, James Poyser, and Mos Def. &quot;Voodoo&quot;″s sessions also had visitors not associated with the project, including record producer Rick Rubin, comedian Chris Rock, and rock musician Eric Clapton. D&#x27;Angelo previewed songs for them, which they found impressive.

D&#x27;Angelo produced songs on Common&#x27;s &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;. Q-Tip was originally intended to contribute a verse to the song &quot;Left &amp; Right&quot;, but was replaced by rappers Method Man &amp; Redman during recording due to creative differences. Questlove has stated that &quot;general opinion was that the song was cool but nobody was feeling Tip&#x27;s verse&quot;. According to former A&amp;R-man Gary Harris, D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s manager Dominique Trenier &quot;thought that Tip&#x27;s verse was wack&quot;. Members of The Roots, including Black Thought, Kamal Gray, and Rahzel, also visited the recording sessions in 1997 to 1999; the band was recording their album &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; (1999) at Electric Lady Studios. That album featured contributions by D&#x27;Angelo, Badu, Mos Def, and Common.

Questlove was the &quot;musical powerhouse&quot; behind several of the Soulquarians&#x27; projects during the late 1990s and early 2000s, including &quot;Voodoo&quot; and &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;. In a 2002 interview, he told critic Jim DeRogatis about his role in recording &quot;Voodoo&quot; and being a part of the Soulquarians, stating &quot;I tried to do all in my power that I could to bring people together – to bring Common to Electric Lady, have him record here whenever so that he could record with some of these other artists. You&#x27;d just come into [the studio&#x27;s] A Room, you don&#x27;t even know who has a session, but you call me: &#x27;Who&#x27;s down there?&#x27; &#x27;Common&#x27;s in there today&#x27;. So you come down, you order some food, sit down and bulls—, watch a movie, and then it&#x27;s, &#x27;Let&#x27;s play something&#x27;. And I say, &#x27;Who wants this [track]?&#x27; And it would be, &#x27;I want it!&#x27; &#x27;No, I want it!&#x27;&quot;. Questlove has referred to the recording experience at the studio as a &quot;left-of-center black music renaissance&quot;.

=== Engineering ===
Audio engineer Russell Elevado, who recorded and mixed &quot;Voodoo&quot;, along with Erykah Badu&#x27;s &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; and Common&#x27;s &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;, used old school recording techniques and vintage mixing gear for the albums in order to achieve the distinct sounds found in classic recorded works. While mainstream recording techniques at the time often involved the use of hi-tech digital equipment, Elevado employed the use of analog equipment, enhancement plug-ins, and a blend of live instrumentation. Notable from the production was that most of it, with the exception of &quot;Untitled (How Does It Feel)&quot;, was recorded live with no overdubbing of its instrumentation, in contrast to contemporary R&amp;B production at the time.

For &quot;Voodoo&quot;″s sessions, D&#x27;Angelo appropriated most of the instruments on the album&#x27;s songs, contributing with drums, electric guitar, keyboards, and percussion. During its recording, he employed amplifiers, microphones, a Fender Rhodes keyboards and organ originally used by musician Stevie Wonder for &quot;Talking Book&quot; (1972), and a recording board originally used by Jimi Hendrix. On &quot;Voodoo&quot;″s recording atmosphere, D&#x27;Angelo stated &quot;I believe Jimi was there. Jimi, Marvin Gaye, all the folks we were gravitating to. I believe they blessed the project&quot;.

D&#x27;Angelo composed all of the bass lines for &quot;Voodoo&quot; and sequenced them for Welsh bassist Pino Palladino, whom he had met after being asked to do a duet with B.B. King at the time of &quot;Voodoo&quot;″s earlier sessions. Palladino was asked by D&#x27;Angelo to learn and improvise the bass arrangements on his 1961 model P bass. For &quot;The Root&quot;, &quot;Greatdayndamornin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Spanish Joint&quot;, guitarist Charlie Hunter simultaneously played guitar and bass sections with a custom eight-string guitar/bass combo, which had three lower bass and five upper guitar strings. It also had separate pickups for each set of strings, as well separate outputs for each pickup. In order to adjust production-wise to Hunter&#x27;s intricate playing, Elevado had separate outputs from Hunter&#x27;s guitar connected to a separate bass and guitar amplifier. He has said that there was enough separation to manage an adequate sound on both amplifiers, in spite of slight &quot;bleeding into each other&quot; from the pickups in close proximity to each other.

=== Grooves and beats ===
D&#x27;Angelo and his supporting personnel constructed several of the songs&#x27; grooves for the album to sit far behind time, directly on top of time, or pressing on the time, making them cluttered and loose in style. Questlove helped design the sparse funk, soul and hip hop beats on the generally groove-based record. In later interviews, Questlove discussed that he and D&#x27;Angelo incorporated much of the distinctive percussive rhythms of Detroit hip hop producer, Slum Village-member and The Ummah-affiliate J Dilla, also known as Jay Dee. A part of the musical collective Soulquarians, Dilla served as a frequent collaborator of theirs. Although album tracks such as &quot;Left &amp; Right&quot; and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Pie&quot; help to bring this claim to light, J Dilla himself was not officially credited for production. However, he contributed significantly to &quot;Voodoo&quot;″s overall sound, specifically the rhythm and percussion.

One of the characteristics of the drumming style implemented in recording the album is human timing, complete with imperfections. This resulted in the album&#x27;s intentional sloppiness. In a later interview, Questlove discussed the intention and purpose of including imperfection in the album&#x27;s sound, stating &quot;we wanted to play as perfectly as we could, but then deliberately insert the little glitch that makes it sound messed up. The idea was to sound disciplined, but with a total human feel.&quot;

Questlove also acknowledged J Dilla&#x27;s influence over the recording sessions for &quot;Voodoo&quot;. He said of Dilla&#x27;s unique programming method during the sessions, &quot;He makes programmed stuff so real, you really can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s programmed. He might program 128 bars, with absolutely no looping or quantizing ... When Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest first played me some of his stuff, I said, &#x27;The drums are messed up! The time is wrong!&#x27; And when we did a song for D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s record that Lenny Kravitz was supposed to play on, Lenny said, &#x27;I can&#x27;t play with this — there&#x27;s a discrepancy in the drum pattern.&#x27; And we&#x27;re like, &#x27;It&#x27;s supposed to be this way!&#x27;

=== Scrapped tracks ===
According to Questlove, a duet track by D&#x27;Angelo and Lauryn Hill, &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot;, was planned. Although tapes were sent via FedEx between the two, the collaboration was aborted and the song was instead recorded by D&#x27;Angelo. Questlove later said that the duet failed to materialize due to &quot;too many middle men [...] I don&#x27;t think Lauryn and D ever talked face-to-face.&quot; Mistakenly, some critics who reviewed the final track assumed that Hill&#x27;s vocals are present in the recording.

During the final days of recording &quot;Voodoo&quot;, Questlove spent time recording a version of Fela Kuti&#x27;s &quot;Water No Get Enemy&quot;, a melodic protest song from Kuti&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Expensive Shit&quot;. He and D&#x27;Angelo had intended to revamp the composition into a minimalist soul ballad for Lauryn Hill to contribute vocals for. However, Hill declined and the track ended up as a place-holder for the rough mix of the album. A reconceptualized version of the song was recorded by D&#x27;Angelo and guest artists on the charity album &quot;Red Hot + Riot&quot; (2002).

== Music ==

In the album&#x27;s EPK, D&#x27;Angelo said that &quot;Voodoo&quot; is &quot;like a funk album&quot;, regarding the genre to be &quot;the natural progression of soul&quot;. while Questlove describes it as &quot;vicarious fantasy&quot;, a &quot;new direction of soul for 2000&quot;, and &quot;the that will reveal the most for your personality&quot;, inspired by &quot;a love for the dead state of black music, a love to show our idols how much they taught us&quot;. Of the album&#x27;s title and meaning, D&#x27;Angelo told &quot;USA Today&quot;: &quot;[T]he myriad influences found on it can be traced through the blues and back deeper in history through songs sung–in religious [voodoo] ceremonies.&quot; This theme is illustrated in &quot;Voodoo&quot;″s liner photography by Thierry LesGoudes, which depicts D&#x27;Angelo participating in a voodoo ceremony. According to &quot;Voodoo&quot;″s press kit: &quot;Lyrically, D&#x27;Angelo offers that much of &quot;Voodoo&quot; is personal reflection: touching on subjects like spirituality, sexuality, growth, and in particular, becoming a father. Musically, as he puts it, &quot;Voodoo&quot; is &#x27;definitely groove-based&#x27;&quot;.

&quot;Voodoo&quot; incorporates musical elements of jazz, funk, hip hop, blues, and soul, as well as ambient music with a musical layer shaped by guitar-based funk. It features vintage influences and a looser, more improvisational structure, which contrasts the more conventional song structure of &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;. Music writer Greg Kot has considered the album a production of the Soulquarians, calling it &quot;the most radical of the many fine records&quot; conceived by the collective&#x27;s members. In an interview with the &quot;New Orleans Times-Picayune&quot;″s Shawn Rhea, D&#x27;Angelo attributed the album&#x27;s experimental and jam-like atmosphere to the fact that most of &quot;Voodoo&quot; was recorded &quot;live and its first take&quot;. On its eclectic and conceptual style, Rhea commented &quot;[D&#x27;Angelo] seems to have channeled the brilliance of his musical forefathers, living and dead, during the crafting of this album. It is a complex, intricate collection of songs that, like voodoo, is simultaneously secular and spiritual, sensual and sacred, earthbound and ethereal&quot;. Recording engineer Russell Elevado&#x27;s analog mixing and old school production techniques contributed to the album&#x27;s jazz element and vintage sound. On its jazz influence, D&#x27;Angelo stated &quot;because a lot of the album was cut live and has free playing on it, it was hard not to go in a jazz direction&quot;.

While most musical compositions rely on tension and release, which can be produced by factors such as soft verses and loud choruses, gradual buildup, subtle tension within verses or over the course of the bridge, or harmonic tension in chords that provides space for improvisation, D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s arrangements for &quot;Voodoo&quot; subdivide the tension into each of the songs&#x27; moments. According to music critic Steve McPherson, the concept results in &quot;no linear way to measure how far off things slide before they pull themselves back ... can&#x27;t be measured in beats or fractions of beats in a meaningful way. For lack of a less clichéd word, it&#x27;s entirely &#x27;feel&#x27;&quot;. This type of syncopation serves as the center for &quot;Voodoo&quot;, rather than the more conventional method of using it as flavoring or departure from the center. According to &quot;New York Daily News&quot; music journalist Jim Farber, &quot;In order to counter the slickness of modern R&amp;B, D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s album reconfigured – and updated – the adventurous song structures and lowdown grooves of early-&#x27;70s works like Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s &#x27;Move On Up&#x27;, Isaac Hayes&#x27; &#x27;Hot Buttered Soul&#x27; and Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &#x27;Let&#x27;s Get It On&#x27;.&quot;

The album features aggressive multi-tracking of D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s voice, a technique similar to the production of Sly &amp; the Family Stone&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; (1971) and Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; (1973). The multi-tracking on &quot;Voodoo&quot; significantly affected the clarity of D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s vocals. In &quot;Voodoo&quot;″s liner notes, Saul Williams wrote of its heavy use of multi-tracking, stating &quot;You might respond, &#x27;Lyrics? Yo, I can&#x27;t even understand half the shit that D&#x27;Angelo be saying. That nigga sounds like Bobby McFerrin on opium&#x27;. And I&#x27;d say, &#x27;You&#x27;re right. Neither can I. But I am drawn to figure out what it is that he&#x27;s saying. His vocal collaging intrigues me&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Between every staccato, breathy, slack-jaw-smooth lyric&quot;, wrote &quot;Spin&quot;″s Julianne Shephard, &quot;was an implied syllable of psychedelic soul sex&quot;. Music writers have also noted the production style and sound of &quot;Voodoo&quot; as reminiscent of the sound of the P-Funk opus &quot;Mothership Connection&quot; (1975), Gaye&#x27;s downtempo disco-soul record &quot;I Want You&quot; (1976), and Miles Davis&#x27;s jazz fusion works &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; (1969) and &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; (1970).

D&#x27;Angelo and his crew also utilized a hip hop production style, which often subordinates song structure to a stable foundation for a rapper&#x27;s delivery and flow. This was familiar to D&#x27;Angelo, as his first original recordings were rap demos. Subsequently, most of the songs were performed without a definitive structure, settling into a mid-tempo groove with minimal verse-chorus-bridge progression. This also resulted in an emphasis on texture over both structure and hooks. &quot;New York&quot; writer Ethan Smith noted this occurrence, stating &quot;most of the songs aren&#x27;t really songs at all – at least, not in the traditional sense&quot;. While not predominant on the album, some tracks incorporate sampling. Most of its production was influenced by hip hop producer J Dilla&#x27;s input. On J Dilla&#x27;s influence, Questlove stated &quot;He&#x27;s the zenith of hip-hop to us. Jay Dee helped to bring out the album&#x27;s dirty sound and encouraged the false starts and the nonquantized sound of the record&quot;.

=== Songs ===

The opening track &quot;Playa Playa&quot; features basketball metaphors and gospel overtones, which accompany the track&#x27;s slow funk and jazz vibe. On his bass playing in the song, Pino Palladino recalled &quot;I was thinking about Stevie Wonder in the choruses and P-Funk in the verses&quot;. Rob Evanoff of &quot;All About Jazz&quot; called the song &quot;an uplifting soul ride&quot;, and stated that it evokes an image of &quot;a musical train seen far off in the distance, slowly getting bigger as it gets closer&quot;. Evanoff also compared the track&#x27;s style to the jam-sound of Pink Floyd, and wrote &quot;it surrounds you with a deep thick infectious groove that, at first, shadows and then envelopes your senses in such a way that is equal bits liberating, intoxicating and hypnotic…you close your eyes and are transported into another dimension&quot;. On the song&#x27;s lyrics, one critic wrote that &quot;D&#x27;Angelo disses all neo-soul wannabes by calmly singing &#x27;Bring the drama playa/Give me all U got&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Devil&#x27;s Pie&quot; is a funk and hip hop diatribe with a lyrical theme concerning hip hop excess, and it is accompanied by P-Funk style harmonies and low-key singing by D&#x27;Angelo. It is a bass-driven track produced by DJ Premier, who contributes to its hip hop texture. The song&#x27;s theme also incorporates religious imagery into its message of social strife. Questlove has stated that &quot;Devil&#x27;s Pie&quot; was written to address the issues of &quot;the money hungry jiggafied state of the world we&#x27;re in&quot;.

&quot;Left &amp; Right&quot; is a funky party jam featuring rappers Method Man and Redman, who exchange verses as D&#x27;Angelo sings the song&#x27;s verses and chorus. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Matt Diehl calls Method Man&#x27;s and Redman&#x27;s lyrics &quot;misogynistic&quot;, adding that it upsets &quot;Voodoo&quot;″s &quot;organically sensual vibe&quot;. The introspective track &quot;The Line&quot; has a downtempo, spiritual sound with lyrics about dealing with some unnamed adversity. According to one critic, it &quot;could be about his MIA status (&#x27;Will I hang or get left hangin?/Will I fall off or is it bangin?/I say it&#x27;s up to God&#x27;), or about anyone facing doubters with a revolver loaded with talent and self-confidence (&#x27;I&#x27;m gonna put my finger on the trigger/I&#x27;m gonna pull it, and then we gon&#x27; see/What the deal/I&#x27;m for real&#x27;)&quot;. Music critic Robert Christgau interpreted the lyrics to be &quot;unjudgmental, unsentimental ... in which a young black man lays out the reasons he&#x27;s ready to die-leaving the listener to wonder why the fuck he should have to think about it&quot;. Andy Peterson of &quot;The GW Hatchet&quot; viewed that the adversity is &quot;the price of fame&quot; or &quot;lamenting a lost lover&quot;.
The sparse funk song &quot;Chicken Grease&quot; has lyrics advising against acting &quot;uptight&quot;, and it features D&#x27;Angelo referencing the line &quot;I know you got soul&quot; from Eric B. &amp; Rakim&#x27;s song of the same name (1987). It contains an ambiguous harmony and bass by Pino Palladino, who evokes the playing style of James Jamerson, with spontaneously improvised variations-on-a-theme parts that sit back &quot;in the pocket&quot;. The track was originally intended for Common&#x27;s &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;, but D&#x27;Angelo offered Common the song &quot;Geto Heaven Part Two&quot; as a trade. &quot;Chicken Grease&quot; is named after a technical term that musician Prince used for his guitarist to play a 9th minor chord while playing 16th notes. The song contains background voices, which one writer described as &quot;omnipresent party people channeled in from &#x27;What&#x27;s Going On&#x27; and &#x27;Voodoo Chile&#x27;, laughin and carryin on all over&quot;. Co-written by D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s former girlfriend, singer Angie Stone, &quot;Send It On&quot; contains lyrics concerning themes of honesty and faith in love, and features jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove on flugel horn. Titled after a southern colloquial conflation of the terms &quot;One More Time&quot; and &quot;Again&quot;, the mid-tempo ballad &quot;One Mo&#x27;Gin&quot; has its narrator reminiscing about a former lover. Its introductory sound consisting of soft organ work and dim percussion evokes the sound of D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s &quot;Sh★t, Damn, Motherf★cker&quot; (1995). &quot;One Mo&#x27;Gin&quot; contains strong jazz overtones and a prominent rocksteady drum rhythm played by Questlove. It incorporates Delta blues-style bass and keyboard-driven verses with a melodic hook. The song is introduced with lead-in bass licks by Pino Palladino, who adds musical texture to its sparse composition by using 10th notes and other arpeggio shapes. According to &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot;″s Tricia Romano, the song&#x27;s music actualizes &quot;new skool sensibility with old school soul&quot;.
According to Questlove, &quot;The Root&quot;, &quot;Spanish Joint&quot;, and &quot;Greatdayndamornin&#x27; / Booty&#x27;&quot; serve as the &quot;virtuoso part of the record&quot;, featuring intricate technical arrangements, no overdubbing, and Charlie Hunter playing both electric and bass guitar. &quot;The Root&quot; is a mid-tempo heartbreak song with the bass line and guitar solo played simultaneously by Hunter on an eight-string guitar. It is about a vengeful woman&#x27;s effect on the narrator: &quot;In the name of love and hope she took my shield and sword ... From the pit of the bottom that knows no floor/Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine/From the alpha of creation, to the end of all time&quot;. Miles Marshall Lewis writes of the song&#x27;s subject matter, &quot;[it] can actually be digested and emotionally felt, sadly rare for Hot 97 R&amp;B.&quot; Co-written by Roy Hargrove, &quot;Spanish Joint&quot; is a salsa-infused, high tempo track about karma. It incorporates rhythmic Brazilian guitar licks by Hunter, funky horn arrangements by Hargrove, and Latin grooves and fusion instrumentation similar to Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t You Worry &#x27;bout a Thing&quot; (1973). &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot; is a cover of Roberta Flack&#x27;s 1974 hit of the same name with a low-key, quiet storm sound. &quot;Greatdayndamornin&#x27; / Booty&#x27;&quot; features double rimshots placed behind the beat by Questlove.
Co-written by Raphael Saadiq, &quot;Untitled (How Does It Feel)&quot; is a tribute to one of D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s primary influences, Prince, and evokes his early &quot;Controversy&quot; period. The similarity of D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s music on &quot;Voodoo&quot; to Prince was addressed in Saul Williams&#x27;s liner notes, as he stated &quot;I&#x27;d pay to see Prince&#x27;s face as he listens to this album.&quot; Questlove described the song as &quot;finding the line between parody and honesty [...] In an era of &#x27;the cover song&#x27;, redoing a Prince song was taboo. This is the second best thing&quot;. It follows a six eight signature and features electric guitar interplay throughout, which is reminiscent of the Jimi Hendrix guitar style and &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; sound. The song contains a drum pattern with a uniform dynamic. D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s vocals were overdubbed several times to produce the sound of a choir singing harmonies during choruses, all of which were sung by D&#x27;Angelo. The song&#x27;s sexually explicit lyrics describe the narrator&#x27;s plea to his lover for sex, as exemplified in the second verse: &quot;Love to make you wet/In between your thighs, cause/I love when it comes inside of you/I get so excited when I&#x27;m around you, baby&quot; It has been cited by critics as the album&#x27;s best song.
The philosophical album closer &quot;Africa&quot; celebrates D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s heritage, while reaffirming his contemporary mission in life. It has been cited by Questlove as his favorite song on the album. The theme of &quot;Africa&quot; concerns the finding of a spiritual home amid geographical displacement, and of passing that sense of belonging on to one&#x27;s children. &quot;Africa&quot; was originally written in honor of D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s son, Michael Archer, Jr., and ended up as a dedication to history, Africa, and God. Opening with a shimmery rustle of chimes, the song contains a drum interpretation of Prince&#x27;s &quot;I Wonder U&quot; from his &quot;Parade&quot; (1986), which was also utilized for the Ursula Rucker and The Roots track &quot;The Return to Innocence Lost&quot; from &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;. Questlove discussed producing the opening chime sounds for &quot;Africa&quot;, stating &quot;we took the cover off the rhodes and mic&#x27;d &#x27;em&quot;. One critic described C. Edward Alford&#x27;s guitar work for &quot;Africa&quot; as &quot;backward guitar solos (at least they &quot;sound&quot; backward)&quot;. Another critic described the song as a &quot;lullaby&quot; and &quot;a gorgeous, opalescent closer ... a prayer of sorts&quot;. &quot;Voodoo&quot;″s coda, which consists of chopped-up track snippets run backwards, plays at the song&#x27;s conclusion.

== Marketing ==

The album&#x27;s release was preceded by several delays, which were primarily caused by the folding of D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s former label EMI Records and legal troubles with his management. It was originally scheduled for release on November 23, 1999, When &quot;Voodoo&quot; was originally presented to Virgin Records executives, mixed opinions formed on whether or not it would succeed commercially, as the project had been heavily financed by the label. In return for the production budget, Virgin executives expected a record with potential for radio-oriented success. However, &quot;Voodoo&quot;″s unconventional sound proved difficult to translate into singles suited for contemporary radio success, in contrast to the more accessible &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;.

&quot;Devil&#x27;s Pie&quot; and &quot;Left &amp; Right&quot; were released as singles but failed to make a significant commercial impact, with the latter having been aimed at R&amp;B and hip hop-oriented radio stations due to the prominence of rappers Redman and Method Man on the track. A music video for &quot;Left &amp; Right&quot;, created by director Malik Hassan Sayeed and producer Rich Ford, Jr., was anticipated by fans and MTV network executives that had planned special promotions and a world premiere for the clip. However, Sayeed&#x27;s concept of a concert video that paid tribute to funk shows of the past expended Virgin&#x27;s budget and resulted in a missed deadline for the MTV premiere. As punishment, the network refused to put the final edit of music video in rotation. It was eventually world-premiered by BET on Thanksgiving Day. According to Ford, both the single and the video went commercially unnoticed due to MTV&#x27;s refusal to place the song&#x27;s video in rotation.

The limited success with singles and lukewarm opinions from label executives led to more promotional efforts and a public response made by D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s management through issuing a statement, which cited &quot;Voodoo&quot; as the R&amp;B musical equivalent of art rock band Radiohead&#x27;s acclaimed studio album &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997). While both records feature an experimental edge, in terms of sound and lyrical themes, the English indie rock scene to which the latter had belonged was album-oriented, as opposed to the contemporary R&amp;B scene in the United States, which was more single-oriented at the time. Prior to its release, Virgin launched an extensive, multi-layered campaign for the album, which setup several promotional performances by D&#x27;Angelo in 1999, including a guest performance on the season premiere of The Chris Rock Show on September 17, New York&#x27;s Key Club, the National Black Programmers Coalition meeting in New Orleans on November 20, KMEL San Francisco&#x27;s House of Soul show on December 10, and KKBT L.A.&#x27;s Holiday Cooldown on December 11. Following commitments made by the label for the album&#x27;s distribution in the UK, continental Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, D&#x27;Angelo appeared at London&#x27;s Music of Black Origin Awards on October 6. Other promotional events included signings and in-store appearances by D&#x27;Angelo at shopping venues such as Macy&#x27;s, Virgin Megastore, and Fulton Mall in New York City, which attracted a considerable number of D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s female fans. A remix album, &quot;Voodoo DJ Soul Essentials&quot; (2000), was also issued by Virgin.

The release of the controversial music video for &quot;Untitled (How Does It Feel)&quot; prior to the album&#x27;s release has been cited as having the greatest promotional impact, boosting the song&#x27;s appeal and D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s popularity. Directed by Paul Hunter, the video features D&#x27;Angelo, filmed from the waist-up, lip-synching in the nude. According to writer Keith M. Harris, it portrayed D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s &quot;discursive play with masculinity and blackness&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; had written of the video, &quot;it&#x27;s pure sexuality. D&#x27;Angelo, muscularly cut and glistening, is shot from the hips up, naked, with just enough shown to prompt a slow burning desire in most any woman who sees it. The video alone could make the song one of the biggest of the coming year&quot;. It would earn three nominations for the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year, Best R&amp;B Video, and Best Male Video. Gaining significant amount of airplay on the BET and MTV networks, the video reintroduced D&#x27;Angelo as a sex icon to a newer generation of fans. It was also viewed at a promotional party thrown in celebration of the album&#x27;s release, which took place in January 2000 at the Centro-Fly nightclub in Chelsea, Manhattan. Douglas Century of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of the club&#x27;s appearance as &quot;packed and sweaty, with decor and soul music out of a 1970&#x27;s time warp: multiple video screens playing images of Curtis Mayfield and vintage &quot;Soul Train&quot; episodes, replete with dancers in Day-Glo bell-bottoms&quot;.

In January 2000, a press release for &quot;Voodoo&quot; was issued discussing the album&#x27;s experimental edge and the anticipation for its release. It called &quot;Voodoo&quot; &quot;the CD that D&#x27;Angelo was put on this earth to create&quot; and &quot;quite literally the record that much of the universal soul nation has been feenin for.&quot; &quot;Voodoo&quot; was ultimately released on January 25, by the Virgin-imprint label Cheeba Sound in the United States, January 18 in Canada and February 14 in the United Kingdom on EMI, awaiting eager anticipation from fans and critics. &quot;Voodoo&quot; was issued with a parental advisory label, due to profanities and sexually explicit lyrics present on the tracks &quot;Devil&#x27;s Pie&quot; and &quot;Left &amp; Right&quot;, and also as a &quot;clean&quot; edited version with an alternate cover. A double LP release was made available in the UK through EMI.

=== Sales ===
In its first week, &quot;Voodoo&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 320,000 copies. It entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on February 12, 2000, and remained on the chart for 33 consecutive weeks. Its debut replaced Carlos Santana&#x27;s &quot;Supernatural&quot; (1999) at the number-one spot on the chart. It had sold over 500,000 copies within its first two months of release. The album charted for 33 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

&quot;Voodoo&quot; charted on several international album charts, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and New Zealand. On February 24, 2000, it was certified gold in sales by the Canadian Recording Industry Association, following sales in excess of 50,000 copies in Canada. Two months after its US release, &quot;Voodoo&quot; was certified platinum on March 1, 2000, by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album&#x27;s platinum certification had coincided with the commencement of &quot;Voodoo&quot;″s supporting tour. By mid-2000, the album had reached sales of 1.3 million copies in the United States. By 2005, the album had sold over 1.7 million copies in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Despite its success, &quot;Voodoo&quot; did not achieve his debut album&#x27;s sales performance nor generate the single-oriented success D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s label had envisioned.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Voodoo&quot; was met with rave reviews from critics, many of whom hailed it as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s greatest work. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau called it a &quot;deeply brave and pretentious record ... signifies like a cross between lesser Tricky and Sly&#x27;s &quot;Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot;&quot;, and wrote of D&#x27;Angelo, &quot;he leads from strength&quot; rather than &quot;tune-and-hook&quot;, &quot;a feel for bass more disquieting than .&quot; &quot;NME&quot; praised its diverse sound and commented that the album &quot;represents nothing less than African American music at a crossroads ... To simply call D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s work neo-classic soul, as per corporate diktat, would be reductive, for that would be to ignore the elements of vaudeville jazz, Memphis horns, ragtime blues, funk and bass grooves, not to mention hip-hop, that slip out of every pore of these 13 haunted songs.&quot; Christopher John Farley of &quot;Time&quot; called it a &quot;richly imagined CD&quot;. Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters called it &quot;the working blueprint for &#x27;post-Soul&#x27; black pop&quot;. Joshua Klein of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; commented that the album &quot;often recalls the muddier bits of Sly Stone&#x27;s later works [...] and the much-missed balladry of prime Prince&quot; and stated, &quot;D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s mellow strategy frequently pays off [...] a brave antidote to current pop and hip-hop trends.&quot;

Despite perceiving a &quot;heavy-handed emphasis on groove over melody&quot; and &quot;self-indulgent&quot; song durations, Miles Marshall Lewis of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; viewed the album as a progression for D&#x27;Angelo and compared it to Prince&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; (1987), noting that the latter album was initially perceived by most critics as &quot;uneven&quot;. Greg Tate of &quot;Vibe&quot; dubbed it &quot;the most daring song-oriented album by a mainstream R&amp;B artist of his generation.&quot; Steve Jones of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote that &quot;no other R&amp;B artist today seems to have as acute an understanding of where he comes from as D&#x27;Angelo, and none seems as willing to take risks in exploring where he should be heading&quot;. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;″s Christopher Gray commented that &quot;&quot;Voodoo&quot; unlocks the brain&#x27;s inner freak like an especially nimble Harry Whodini&quot;. Rob Evanoff of &quot;All About Jazz&quot; gave it five out of five stars and called it &quot;a record you put on and let it seep in, soaking your essence and one that evolves over subsequent listens... an aural aphrodisiac&quot;. He found it to be in the tradition of classic jazz albums and wrote of its musical significance, stating:

However, some critics found it inconsistent. Music journalist Peter Shapiro criticized its &quot;loose playing and bohemian self-indulgence&quot;, stating &quot;&quot;Voodoo&quot; drifted all over the map in a blunted haze&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s James Hunter disapproved of the experimental and loose-sounding structure, and viewed that it does not attain its potential, stating &quot;long stretches of it are unfocused and unabsorbing [...] &quot;Voodoo&quot; flatters the &quot;real&quot; at the expense of the thing. The result is superb smoke, but smoke nonetheless&quot;. By contrast, Jon Caramanica wrote in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004) that &quot;D&#x27;Angelo achieves through nuance what some singers with decades of experience and training never achieve: a throbbing, vital presence, that demands attention, even as it shuns it&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
In 2001, &quot;Voodoo&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Album at the 43rd Grammy Awards, which was awarded to D&#x27;Angelo and recording engineer Russell Elevado. The song &quot;Untitled (How Does It Feel)&quot; won for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance and was also nominated for Best R&amp;B Song. The song was also ranked number 12 on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll of 2000, as well as number 4 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;End of Year Critics &amp; Readers Poll&quot; of the top singles of the year. &quot;Voodoo&quot; proved to be one of the most critically praised and awarded albums of the year, topping several critics&#x27; and publications&#x27; &quot;end of year&quot; lists, including the number 6 spot on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 2000 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Spin&quot; magazine both ranked it number 4 on their &quot;albums of the year&quot; lists, while &quot;Time&quot; magazine named &quot;Voodoo&quot; as the number 1 album of 2000. &quot;Voodoo&quot; was named one of the top ten albums of 2000 by several &quot;New York Times&quot; staff writers, including Ben Ratliff (number 2), Neil Strauss (number 3), Ann Powers (number 2), and Jon Pareles (number 1).

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 488 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and at number 481 in a revised list in 2012. In the 2020, the album was re-ranked at 28, calling it &quot;an album heavy on bass and drenched in a post-coital haze&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Voodoo&quot; number 44 on its list of the Top 200 Albums of the 2000s decade, calling it &quot;a triumph of hands-on, real-time, old-school soul minimalism&quot; and citing D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s vocals as &quot;maybe the most erotically tactile singing put to disc this decade&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the album at number 23 on its list of the 100 Best Albums of the Decade, stating &quot;The decade&#x27;s most magnificent R&amp;B record was also its most inventive — so far ahead of its time that it still sounds radical&quot;. AllMusic editor Andy Kellman has cited &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Voodoo&quot; as &quot;two of the most excellent and singular R&amp;B albums of the past 15 years&quot;.

== Tour and aftermath ==

Following &quot;Voodoo&quot;″s release, D&#x27;Angelo embarked on his second international tour in support of the album, &quot;The Voodoo Tour&quot;. The tour was sponsored by the clothing company Levi Strauss &amp; Co., and it featured D&#x27;Angelo promoting an end to gun violence. After signing an initiative on June 7, 2000, at Hamilton High School in West Los Angeles to collect a million signatures by November 7 in support of &quot;common-sense solutions&quot; to end gun violence, the anti-gun violence organization PAX agreed to sponsor the tour. The tour was also set to feature a wall composed of denim by Levi&#x27;s, made available for fans to sign in support of anti-gun violence. D&#x27;Angelo was backed by a group of session personnel and other musicians, assembled and directed by Questlove, called the Soultronics. J Dilla&#x27;s group Slum Village opened on several dates, while R&amp;B singer Anthony Hamilton sang backup within the Soultronics on occasion.

D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s wardrobe during the tour included tank tops, black leather pants, and boots. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Touré commented on one of the outings, &quot;The Soultronics begin each show in all black, but beyond that one requirement, each looks completely distinct. One man is in a deacon&#x27;s robe, another in a long cape with a knit ski cap that says FBI. There&#x27;s a feather boa, a few badass leather coats, and Questlove&#x27;s mighty Afro. There&#x27;s a P-Funkish freaky flair to the Soultronics&#x27; look.&quot; In contrast to D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s performing behind his keyboard when promoting &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, his performances were more lively for &quot;Voodoo&quot;. Tour manager Alan Leeds, who headed James Brown&#x27;s late 1960s and early 1970s outings, as well as Prince&#x27;s &quot;Purple Rain&quot; tour in the mid-1980s, cited &quot;The Voodoo Tour&quot; as his most memorable gig. Footage from the tour was later used in the music video for &quot;Voodoo&quot;″s next single &quot;Send It On&quot;.

With ticket prices ranging from $49 to $79, the tour became one of the most attended shows of 2000. By July, the tour&#x27;s first half had sold out in each city. The tour lasted nearly eight months, while performances went for up to three hours a night. The tour began on March 1, 2000, at the House of Blues in Los Angeles. &quot;The Voodoo Tour&quot; was taken internationally to venues including Paris Olympia, Trump Taj Mahal, Brixton Academy, the Montreux Jazz Festival, the North Sea Jazz Festival and the Free Jazz Festival in Brazil.

The music video for &quot;Untitled (How Does It Feel)&quot; portrayed D&#x27;Angelo as a sex symbol to mainstream music audiences, which had repercussions on &quot;The Voodoo Tour&quot;″s second half. During the tour, female fans yelled out for him to take his clothes off, while others tossed clothes onto the stage. As trumpeter Roy Hargrove recounted, &quot;We couldn&#x27;t get through one song before women would start to scream for him to take off something [...] It wasn&#x27;t about the music. All they wanted him to do was take off his clothes.&quot; This led to frustration and both onstage and offstage outbursts by D&#x27;Angelo, with him breaking stage equipment. Questlove later said, &quot;He&#x27;d get angry and start breaking shit. The audience thinking, &#x27;Fuck your art, I wanna see your ass!&#x27;, made him angry.&quot; Although some were cancelled due to D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s throat infection during the tour&#x27;s mid-March dates, many shows were cancelled due to his personal and emotional problems. D&#x27;Angelo chose on several occasions to not perform on scheduled dates, and delayed others to do physical workouts like stomach crunches. According to Questlove, three weeks worth of concert dates were cancelled, including two weeks worth of shows in Japan. He elaborated on the experience in a 2003 interview for &quot;The Believer&quot;, saying that:

In the same interview, Questlove also said that he had not been fully compensated for his work on &quot;Voodoo&quot;, stating &quot;I didn’t get the rest of my check.&quot; Several of D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s peers and affiliates have noted the commercial impact of the &quot;Untitled (How Does It Feel)&quot; music video and &quot;The Voodoo Tour&quot; as contributing factors to D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s extended period of absence from the music scene after &quot;Voodoo&quot;.

<text>In signal processing, the power spectrum formula_1 of a continuous time signal formula_2 describes the distribution of power into frequency components formula_3 composing that signal. According to Fourier analysis, any physical signal can be decomposed into a number of discrete frequencies, or a spectrum of frequencies over a continuous range. The statistical average of any sort of signal (including noise) as analyzed in terms of its frequency content, is called its spectrum.

When the energy of the signal is concentrated around a finite time interval, especially if its total energy is finite, one may compute the energy spectral density. More commonly used is the power spectral density (PSD, or simply power spectrum), which applies to signals existing over &quot;all&quot; time, or over a time period large enough (especially in relation to the duration of a measurement) that it could as well have been over an infinite time interval. The PSD then refers to the spectral energy distribution that would be found per unit time, since the total energy of such a signal over all time would generally be infinite. Summation or integration of the spectral components yields the total power (for a physical process) or variance (in a statistical process), identical to what would be obtained by integrating formula_4 over the time domain, as dictated by Parseval&#x27;s theorem.

The spectrum of a physical process formula_2 often contains essential information about the nature of formula_6. For instance, the pitch and timbre of a musical instrument are immediately determined from a spectral analysis. The color of a light source is determined by the spectrum of the electromagnetic wave&#x27;s electric field formula_7 as it fluctuates at an extremely high frequency. Obtaining a spectrum from time series such as these involves the Fourier transform, and generalizations based on Fourier analysis. In many cases the time domain is not specifically employed in practice, such as when a dispersive prism is used to obtain a spectrum of light in a spectrograph, or when a sound is perceived through its effect on the auditory receptors of the inner ear, each of which is sensitive to a particular frequency.
However this article concentrates on situations in which the time series is known (at least in a statistical sense) or directly measured (such as by a microphone sampled by a computer). The power spectrum is important in statistical signal processing and in the statistical study of stochastic processes, as well as in many other branches of physics and engineering. Typically the process is a function of time, but one can similarly discuss data in the spatial domain being decomposed in terms of spatial frequency.

== Units ==
In physics, the signal might be a wave, such as an electromagnetic wave, an acoustic wave, or the vibration of a mechanism. The &quot;power spectral density&quot; (PSD) of the signal describes the power present in the signal as a function of frequency, per unit frequency. Power spectral density is commonly expressed in SI units of watts per hertz (abbreviated as W/Hz).

When a signal is defined in terms only of a voltage, for instance, there is no unique power associated with the stated amplitude. In this case &quot;power&quot; is simply reckoned in terms of the square of the signal, as this would always be &quot;proportional&quot; to the actual power delivered by that signal into a given impedance. So one might use units of V2 Hz−1 for the PSD. &quot;Energy spectral density&quot; (ESD) would have units of V2 s Hz−1, since energy has units of power multiplied by time (e.g., watt-hour).

In the general case, the units of PSD will be the ratio of units of variance per unit of frequency; so, for example, a series of displacement values (in meters) over time (in seconds) will have PSD in units of meters squared per hertz, m2/Hz.
In the analysis of random vibrations, units of &quot;g&quot;2 Hz−1 are frequently used for the PSD of acceleration, where &quot;g&quot; denotes the g-force.

Mathematically, it is not necessary to assign physical dimensions to the signal or to the independent variable. In the following discussion the meaning of &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) will remain unspecified, but the independent variable will be assumed to be that of time.

=== One-sided vs two-sided ===
A PSD can be either a &quot;one-sided&quot; function of only positive frequencies or a &quot;two-sided&quot; function of both positive and negative frequencies but with only half the amplitude. Noise PSDs are generally one-sided in engineering and two-sided in physics.

== Definition ==

=== Energy spectral density ===
In signal processing, the energy of a signal formula_2 is given by
formula_9
Assuming the total energy is finite (i.e. formula_2 is a square-integrable function) allows applying Parseval&#x27;s theorem (or Plancherel&#x27;s theorem). That is,
formula_11
where
formula_12
is the Fourier transform of formula_2 at frequency formula_3 (in Hz). The theorem also holds true in the discrete-time cases. Since the integral on the left-hand side is the energy of the signal, the value offormula_15 can be interpreted as a density function multiplied by an infinitesimally small frequency interval, describing the energy contained in the signal at frequency formula_3 in the frequency interval formula_17. 

Therefore, the energy spectral density of formula_2 is defined as:

The function formula_19 and the autocorrelation of formula_2 form a Fourier transform pair, a result also known as the Wiener–Khinchin theorem (see also Periodogram).

As a physical example of how one might measure the energy spectral density of a signal, suppose formula_21 represents the potential (in volts) of an electrical pulse propagating along a transmission line of impedance formula_22, and suppose the line is terminated with a matched resistor (so that all of the pulse energy is delivered to the resistor and none is reflected back). By Ohm&#x27;s law, the power delivered to the resistor at time formula_23 is equal to formula_24, so the total energy is found by integrating formula_24 with respect to time over the duration of the pulse. To find the value of the energy spectral density formula_19 at frequency formula_3, one could insert between the transmission line and the resistor a bandpass filter which passes only a narrow range of frequencies (formula_28, say) near the frequency of interest and then measure the total energy formula_29 dissipated across the resistor. The value of the energy spectral density at formula_3 is then estimated to be formula_31. In this example, since the power formula_24 has units of V2 Ω−1, the energy formula_29 has units of V2 s Ω−1 = J, and hence the estimate formula_34 of the energy spectral density has units of J Hz−1, as required. In many situations, it is common to forget the step of dividing by formula_22 so that the energy spectral density instead has units of V2 Hz−1.

This definition generalizes in a straightforward manner to a discrete signal with a countably infinite number of values formula_36 such as a signal sampled at discrete times formula_37:
formula_38
where formula_39 is the discrete-time Fourier transform of formula_40  The sampling interval formula_41 is needed to keep the correct physical units and to ensure that we recover the continuous case in the limit formula_42  But in the mathematical sciences the interval is often set to 1, which simplifies the results at the expense of generality. (also see normalized frequency)

=== Power spectral density ===
The above definition of energy spectral density is suitable for transients (pulse-like signals) whose energy is concentrated around one time window; then the Fourier transforms of the signals generally exist. For continuous signals over all time, one must rather define the &quot;power spectral density&quot; (PSD) which exists for stationary processes; this describes how the power of a signal or time series is distributed over frequency, as in the simple example given previously. Here, power can be the actual physical power, or more often, for convenience with abstract signals, is simply identified with the squared value of the signal. For example, statisticians study the variance of a function over time formula_2 (or over another independent variable), and using an analogy with electrical signals (among other physical processes), it is customary to refer to it as the &quot;power spectrum&quot; even when there is no physical power involved. If one were to create a physical voltage source which followed formula_2 and applied it to the terminals of a one ohm resistor, then indeed the instantaneous power dissipated in that resistor would be given by formula_4 watts.

The average power formula_46 of a signal formula_2 over all time is therefore given by the following time average, where the period formula_48 is centered about some arbitrary time formula_49:
formula_50

Whenever it is more convenient to deal with time limits in the signal itself rather than time limits in the bounds of the integral, the average power can also be written as 
formula_51
where formula_52 and formula_53 is unity within the arbitrary period and zero elsewhere. 

When formula_46 is non-zero, the integral must grow to infinity at least as fast as formula_55 does. That is the reason why we cannot use the energy of the signal, which is that diverging integral.

In analyzing the frequency content of the signal formula_2, one might like to compute the ordinary Fourier transform formula_57; however, for many signals of interest the ordinary Fourier transform does not formally exist. However, under suitable conditions, certain generalizations of the Fourier transform (e.g. the Fourier-Stieltjes transform) still adhere to Parseval&#x27;s theorem. As such,
formula_58
where the integrand defines the power spectral density:

The convolution theorem then allows regarding formula_59 as the Fourier transform of the time convolution of formula_60 and formula_61, where * represents the complex conjugate.

In order to deduce Eq.2, we will find an expression for formula_62 that will be useful for the purpose. In fact, we will demonstrate that formula_63. Let&#x27;s start by noting that
formula_64
and let formula_65, so that formula_66 when formula_67 and vice versa. So
formula_68
Where, in the last line, we have made use of the fact that formula_69 and formula_23 are dummy variables.
So, we have
formula_71
q.e.d.

Now, let&#x27;s demonstrate eq.2 by using the demonstrated identity. In addition, we will make the subtitution formula_72. In this way, we have:
formula_73
where the convolution theorem has been used when passing from the 3rd to the 4th line.

Now, if we divide the time convolution above by the period formula_55 and take the limit as formula_75, it becomes the autocorrelation function of the non-windowed signal formula_76, which is denoted as formula_77, provided that formula_2 is ergodic, which is true in most, but not all, practical cases.
formula_79

Assuming the ergodicity of formula_2, the power spectral density can be found once more as the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function (Wiener–Khinchin theorem).

Many authors use this equality to actually define the power spectral density.

The power of the signal in a given frequency band formula_81, where formula_82, can be calculated by integrating over frequency. Since formula_83, an equal amount of power can be attributed to positive and negative frequency bands, which accounts for the factor of 2 in the following form (such trivial factors depend on the conventions used):
formula_84
More generally, similar techniques may be used to estimate a time-varying spectral density. In this case the time interval formula_55 is finite rather than approaching infinity. This results in decreased spectral coverage and resolution since frequencies of less than formula_86 are not sampled, and results at frequencies which are not an integer multiple of formula_86 are not independent. Just using a single such time series, the estimated power spectrum will be very &quot;noisy&quot;; however this can be alleviated if it is possible to evaluate the expected value (in the above equation) using a large (or infinite) number of short-term spectra corresponding to statistical ensembles of realizations of formula_2 evaluated over the specified time window.

Just as with the energy spectral density, the definition of the power spectral density can be generalized to discrete time variables formula_36. As before, we can consider a window of formula_90 with the signal sampled at discrete times formula_91 for a total measurement period formula_92.
formula_93
Note that a single estimate of the PSD can be obtained through a finite number of samplings. As before, the actual PSD is achieved when formula_94 (and thus formula_55) approaches infinity and the expected value is formally applied. In a real-world application, one would typically average a finite-measurement PSD over many trials to obtain a more accurate estimate of the theoretical PSD of the physical process underlying the individual measurements. This computed PSD is sometimes called a periodogram. This periodogram converges to the true PSD as the number of estimates as well as the averaging time interval formula_55 approach infinity.

If two signals both possess power spectral densities, then the cross-spectral density can similarly be calculated; as the PSD is related to the autocorrelation, so is the cross-spectral density related to the cross-correlation.

==== Properties of the power spectral density ====

Some properties of the PSD include:
=== Cross power spectral density ===
Given two signals formula_2 and formula_98, each of which possess power spectral densities formula_1 and formula_100, it is possible to define a cross power spectral density (CPSD) or cross spectral density (CSD). To begin, let us consider the average power of such a combined signal.
formula_101

Using the same notation and methods as used for the power spectral density derivation, we exploit Parseval&#x27;s theorem and obtain
formula_102
where, again, the contributions of formula_1 and formula_100 are already understood. Note that formula_105, so the full contribution to the cross power is, generally, from twice the real part of either individual CPSD. Just as before, from here we recast these products as the Fourier transform of a time convolution, which when divided by the period and taken to the limit formula_106 becomes the Fourier transform of a cross-correlation function.
formula_107
where formula_108 is the cross-correlation of formula_2 with formula_98 and formula_111 is the cross-correlation of formula_98 with formula_2. In light of this, the PSD is seen to be a special case of the CSD for formula_114. If formula_2 and formula_98 are real signals (e.g. voltage or current), their Fourier transforms formula_57 and formula_118 are usually restricted to positive frequencies by convention. Therefore, in typical signal processing, the full CPSD is just one of the CPSDs scaled by a factor of two.
formula_119

For discrete signals and , the relationship between the cross-spectral density and the cross-covariance is
formula_120

== Estimation ==
The goal of spectral density estimation is to estimate the spectral density of a random signal from a sequence of time samples. Depending on what is known about the signal, estimation techniques can involve parametric or non-parametric approaches, and may be based on time-domain or frequency-domain analysis. For example, a common parametric technique involves fitting the observations to an autoregressive model. A common non-parametric technique is the periodogram.

The spectral density is usually estimated using Fourier transform methods (such as the Welch method), but other techniques such as the maximum entropy method can also be used.

== Related concepts ==
* The &quot;spectral centroid&quot; of a signal is the midpoint of its spectral density function, i.e. the frequency that divides the distribution into two equal parts.
* The spectral edge frequency (SEF), usually expressed as &quot;SEF &quot;x&quot;&quot;, represents the frequency below which &quot;x&quot; percent of the total power of a given signal are located; typically, &quot;x&quot; is in the range 75 to 95. It is more particularly a popular measure used in EEG monitoring, in which case SEF has variously been used to estimate the depth of anesthesia and stages of sleep.
* A spectral envelope is the envelope curve of the spectrum density. It describes one point in time (one window, to be precise). For example, in remote sensing using a spectrometer, the spectral envelope of a feature is the boundary of its spectral properties, as defined by the range of brightness levels in each of the spectral bands of interest.
* The spectral density is a function of frequency, not a function of time. However, the spectral density of a small window of a longer signal may be calculated, and plotted versus time associated with the window. Such a graph is called a &quot;spectrogram&quot;. This is the basis of a number of spectral analysis techniques such as the short-time Fourier transform and wavelets.
* A &quot;spectrum&quot; generally means the power spectral density, as discussed above, which depicts the distribution of signal content over frequency. For transfer functions (e.g., Bode plot, chirp) the complete frequency response may be graphed in two parts: power versus frequency and phase versus frequency—the phase spectral density, phase spectrum, or spectral phase. Less commonly, the two parts may be the real and imaginary parts of the transfer function. This is not to be confused with the &quot;frequency response&quot; of a transfer function, which also includes a phase (or equivalently, a real and imaginary part) as a function of frequency. The time-domain impulse response formula_121 cannot generally be uniquely recovered from the power spectral density alone without the phase part. Although these are also Fourier transform pairs, there is no symmetry (as there is for the autocorrelation) forcing the Fourier transform to be real-valued. See Ultrashort pulse#Spectral phase, phase noise, group delay.
* Sometimes one encounters an amplitude spectral density (ASD), which is the square root of the PSD; the ASD of a voltage signal has units of V Hz−1/2. This is useful when the &quot;shape&quot; of the spectrum is rather constant, since variations in the ASD will then be proportional to variations in the signal&#x27;s voltage level itself. But it is mathematically preferred to use the PSD, since only in that case is the area under the curve meaningful in terms of actual power over all frequency or over a specified bandwidth.

== Applications ==

Any signal that can be represented as a variable that varies in time has a corresponding frequency spectrum. This includes familiar entities such as visible light (perceived as color), musical notes (perceived as pitch), radio/TV (specified by their frequency, or sometimes wavelength) and even the regular rotation of the earth. When these signals are viewed in the form of a frequency spectrum, certain aspects of the received signals or the underlying processes producing them are revealed. In some cases the frequency spectrum may include a distinct peak corresponding to a sine wave component. And additionally there may be peaks corresponding to harmonics of a fundamental peak, indicating a periodic signal which is &quot;not&quot; simply sinusoidal. Or a continuous spectrum may show narrow frequency intervals which are strongly enhanced corresponding to resonances, or frequency intervals containing almost zero power as would be produced by a notch filter.

=== Electrical engineering ===
The concept and use of the power spectrum of a signal is fundamental in electrical engineering, especially in electronic communication systems, including radio communications, radars, and related systems, plus passive remote sensing technology. Electronic instruments called spectrum analyzers are used to observe and measure the power spectra of signals.

The spectrum analyzer measures the magnitude of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of an input signal. If the signal being analyzed can be considered a stationary process, the STFT is a good smoothed estimate of its power spectral density.

=== Cosmology ===
Primordial fluctuations, density variations in the early universe, are quantified by a power spectrum which gives the power of the variations as a function of spatial scale.

<text>This article contains information about the literary events and publications of 1891.

==Events==

*January – &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; is first published in London. On June 25 Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s private consulting detective Sherlock Holmes appears in it for the first time, in the story &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; (issue dated July).
*January 31 – Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; published in 1890 is first performed, at the Königliches Residenz-Theater in Munich, the city where it was written. The lead is played by Clara Heese (1861–1921), but Ibsen is displeased with her performance. The first British performance is on April 20 at the recently reopened Vaudeville Theatre, London, with Elizabeth Robins as Hedda and co-directing.
*March 13 – Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play &quot;Ghosts&quot; (published in 1881) achieves a single London performance, its English-language stage première (at the Royalty Theatre). To evade the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office&#x27;s censorship, it has to be staged privately by the Independent Theatre Society, but still attracts strong criticism on moral grounds.
*April – Oscar Wilde&#x27;s novel &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; is first published in book format by Ward and Lock in London with the aphoristic preface originally published in the March 1 issue of &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot;.
*May – William Morris establishes the Kelmscott Press as a private press at Hammersmith (London) and produces its first book, the first edition in book format of his fantasy novel &quot;The Story of the Glittering Plain&quot;.
*May 21 – Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s play &quot;Intruder (L&#x27;Intruse)&quot; is premièred at Paul Fort&#x27;s Théâtre d&#x27;Art in Paris.
*c. Late June – In a meeting of decadent poets in London, Oscar Wilde is first introduced to Lord Alfred Douglas by Lionel Johnson at Wilde&#x27;s Tite Street home.
*July 1 – The International Copyright Act of 1891 comes into effect in the United States, permitting foreign authors to register their works for copyright. On July 3, the first such work, the play &quot;Saints and Sinners&quot; by English author Henry Arthur Jones, is registered.
*July 4–December 26 – Thomas Hardy&#x27;s novel &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; is serialized in expurgated form in the weekly illustrated newspaper &quot;The Graphic&quot; (London); in November the first (unexpurgated) book edition is published in London.
*August 22 – Israel Zangwill&#x27;s &quot;The Big Bow Mystery&quot;, the first classic full-length locked room mystery, begins serialization in &quot;The Star&quot; (London).
*September 4 – Ambrose Bierce dates the preface of &quot;Tales of Soldiers and Civilians&quot; for this day, although it will not actually be issued (in San Francisco) until 1892. It includes &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge&quot;, one of his best known works.
*October – Tristan Bernard has his first work published in &quot;La Revue Blanche&quot;, which returns to Parisian publication this month, and adopts his pseudonym.
*October 9 – Émile Zola&#x27;s stage adaptation of his novel &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; (first performed in 1873) achieves a single London performance, its English stage première (at the Royalty Theatre). To evade the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office&#x27;s censorship it has to be staged privately by the Independent Theatre Society, but still attracts criticism on moral grounds.
*December – Thomas Hardy writes &quot;The Son&#x27;s Veto&quot;, which he regards as his best short story.
*December 7 – Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s play &quot;The Blind (Les aveugles)&quot; is premièred.
*&quot;unknown dates&quot;
**Sophia Alice Callahan&#x27;s &quot;Wynema, a Child of the Forest&quot; is published, the first work of fiction by a Native American woman in English.
**Publication of the first complete one-volume popular German translation of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays
*&quot;probable&quot; – Edmund Clerihew Bentley, G. K. Chesterton and fellow pupils of St Paul&#x27;s School, London, compose the first pseudo-biographical comic verses which become known as clerihews.

<doc id="202677" wikidata="Q12195220" url="?curid=202677" title="Human rights in Ba'athist Iraq">
<text>Under the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party, Iraq&#x27;s human rights record was considered one of the worst in the world. Secret police, state terrorism, torture, mass murder, genocide, ethnic cleansing, rape, deportations, extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, assassinations, chemical warfare, and the destruction of the Mesopotamian marshes were some of the methods Saddam Hussein and the country&#x27;s Ba&#x27;athist government used to maintain control. Saddam committed crimes of aggression during the Iran–Iraq War and the Gulf War, which violated the Charter of the United Nations. The total number of deaths and disappearances related to repression during this period is unknown, but is estimated to be at least 250,000 to 290,000 according to Human Rights Watch, with the great majority of those occurring as a result of the Anfal genocide in 1988 and the suppression of the uprisings in Iraq in 1991. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International issued regular reports of widespread imprisonment and torture.

==Documented human rights violations 1979–2003==

Human rights organizations have documented government-approved executions, acts of torture and rape for decades since Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979 until his fall in 2003.

* In 2002, a resolution sponsored by the European Union was adopted by the Commission for Human Rights, which stated that there had been no improvement in the human rights crisis in Iraq. The statement condemned President Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government for its &quot;systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law&quot; and called on Iraq to cease &quot;summary and arbitrary executions ... the use of rape as a political tool and all enforced and involuntary disappearances&quot;.
* Full political participation at the national level was restricted only to members of the Ba&#x27;ath Party, which constituted only 8% of the population.
* Iraqi citizens were not legally allowed to assemble unless it was in express support of the Ba&#x27;athist government. The Iraqi government controlled the establishment of political parties, regulated their internal affairs and monitored their activities.
* Police checkpoints on Iraq&#x27;s roads and highways prevented ordinary citizens from traveling across country without government permission and expensive exit visas prevented Iraqi citizens from traveling abroad. Before traveling, an Iraqi citizen had to post collateral. Iraqi females could not travel outside of the country without the escort of a male relative.
*The Persecution of Feyli Kurds under Saddam Hussein, also known as the Feyli Kurdish genocide, was a systematic persecution of Feylis by Saddam Hussein between 1970 and 2003. The persecution campaigns led to the expulsion, flight and effective exile of the Feyli Kurds from their ancestral lands in Iraq. The persecution began when a large number of Feyli Kurds were exposed to a big campaign by the regime that began by the dissolved RCCR issuance for 666 decision, which deprived Feyli Kurds of Iraqi nationality and considered them as Iranians. The systematic executions started in Baghdad and Khanaqin in 1979 and later spread to other Iraqi and Kurdish areas. It is estimated that around 25,000 Feyli Kurds died due to captivity and torture.
*Halabja poison gas attack: The Halabja poison gas attack occurred in the period 15–19 March 1988 during the Iran–Iraq War when chemical weapons were used by the Iraqi government forces and thousands of civilians in the Iraqi Kurdish town of Halabja were killed.

*Anfal campaign: In 1988, the Hussein regime began a campaign of extermination against the Kurdish people living in Northern Iraq. This is known as the Anfal campaign. A team of Human Rights Watch investigators determined, after analyzing eighteen tons of captured Iraqi documents, testing soil samples and carrying out interviews with more than 350 witnesses, that the attacks on the Kurdish people were characterized by gross violations of human rights. These included the mass execution and forced disappearance of many tens of thousands of noncombatants, widespread use of chemical weapons including Sarin, mustard gas and nerve agents, arbitrary imprisonment - including of women, children and the elderly - in conditions of extreme deprivation, the forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of villagers after the demolition of their homes, and the wholesale destruction of nearly two thousand villages along with their schools, mosques, farms and power stations.
* 50,000 to 70,000 Shia were arrested in the 1980s and never heard from again.
* 8,000 Kurds from the Barzani clan were disappeared and likely killed.
* 50,000 dissidents, party members, Kurds, and other minorities were disappeared and presumably killed in the 1980s through 1990s 
* In April 1991, after Saddam lost control of Kuwait in the Persian Gulf War, he cracked down ruthlessly against several uprisings in the Kurdish north and the Shia south. His forces committed full-scale and other gross human rights violations against both groups similar to the violations mentioned before.
* In June 1994, the Hussein regime in Iraq established severe penalties, including amputation, branding and the death penalty for criminal offenses such as theft, corruption, currency speculation and military desertion, some of which are part of Islamic Sharia law, while government members and members of Saddam&#x27;s family were immune from punishments for these crimes.
* In 2001, the Iraqi government amended the Constitution to make sodomy a capital offense.
* In 1996 more than 40 Iraqi Turkmen were massacred in Erbil.
* On March 23, 2003, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Iraqi television presented and interviewed prisoners of war on TV, violating the Geneva Convention.
* Also in April 2003, CNN revealed that it had withheld information about Iraq torturing journalists and Iraqi citizens in the 1990s. According to CNN&#x27;s chief news executive, the channel had been concerned for the safety not only of its own staff, but also of Iraqi sources and informants, who could expect punishment for speaking freely to reporters. Also according to the executive, &quot;other news organizations were in the same bind.&quot;
* After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, several mass graves were found in Iraq containing several thousand bodies total and more are being uncovered to this day. While most of the dead in the graves were believed to have died in the 1991 uprising against Saddam Hussein, some of them appeared to have died due to executions or died at times other than the 1991 rebellion.
* Also after the invasion, numerous torture centers were found in security offices and police stations throughout Iraq. The equipment found at these centers typically included hooks for hanging people by the hands for beatings, devices for electric shock and other equipment often found in nations with harsh security services and other authoritarian nations.

==&quot;Saddam&#x27;s Dirty Dozen&quot;==

According to officials of the United States State Department, many human rights abuses in Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq were largely carried out in person or by the orders of Saddam Hussein and eleven other people.
The term &quot;Saddam&#x27;s Dirty Dozen&quot; was coined in October 2002 (from a novel by E.M. Nathanson, later adapted as a film directed by Robert Aldrich) and used by US officials to describe this group. Most members of the group held high positions in the Iraqi government and membership went all the way from Saddam&#x27;s personal guard to Saddam&#x27;s sons. The list was used by the Bush Administration to help argue that the 2003 Iraq war was against Saddam Hussein and the Baath Party leadership, rather than against the Iraqi people. The members are:

*Saddam Hussein (1937–2006), Iraqi President, responsible for many torturings, killings and of ordering the 1988 cleansing of Kurds in Northern Iraq.
*Qusay Hussein (1966–2003), son of the president, head of the elite Republican Guard, believed to have been chosen by Saddam as his .
*Uday Hussein (1964–2003), son of the president, had a private torture chamber, and was responsible for the rapes and killings of many women. He was partially paralyzed after a 1996 attempt on his life, and was leader of the paramilitary group Fedayeen Saddam and of the Iraqi media.
*Taha Yassin Ramadan (1938–2007), Vice-President, born in Iraqi Kurdistan. He oversaw the mass killings of a Shi&#x27;a revolt in 1991.
*Tariq Aziz (1936–2015), Foreign Minister of Iraq, backed up the executions by hanging of political opponents after the revolution of 1968.
*Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti (1951–2007), Hussein&#x27;s brother, leader of the Iraqi secret service, &quot;Mukhabarat&quot;. He was Iraq&#x27;s representative to the United Nations in Geneva.
*Sabawi Ibrahim al-Tikriti (1947–2013), Saddam&#x27;s half brother, he was the leader of the &quot;Mukhabarat&quot; during the 1991 Gulf War. Director of Iraq&#x27;s general security from 1991 to 1996. He was involved in the 1991 suppression of Kurds.
*Watban Ibrahim al-Tikriti (1952–2015), Saddam&#x27;s half brother, former senior Interior Minister who was also Saddam&#x27;s presidential adviser. Shot in the leg by Uday Hussein in 1995. He has ordered tortures, rapes, murders and deportations.
*Ali Hassan al-Majid (1941–2010), &quot;Chemical Ali&quot;, mastermind behind Saddam&#x27;s lethal gassing of Kurdish civilians in 1988; a first cousin of Saddam Hussein.
*Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri (1942–2020), military commander, vice-president of the &quot;Revolutionary Command Council&quot; and deputy commander in chief of the armed forces during various military campaigns.
*Aziz Saleh Nuhmah (b. ?), appointed governor of Kuwait from November 1990 to February 1991, ordered looting of stores and rapes of Kuwaiti women during his tenure. Also ordered the destruction of Shi&#x27;a holy sites during the 1970s and 1980s as governor of two Iraqi provinces.
*Mohammed Hamza Zubeidi (1938–2005), alias &quot;Saddam&#x27;s thug&quot;, Prime Minister of Iraq from 1991 to 1993 – to have ordered many executions.

==Other atrocities==
The destruction of Shi&#x27;ite religious shrines by the former government has been compared &quot;to the leveling of cities in the Second World War, and the damage to the shrines [of Hussein and Abbas] was more serious than that which had been done to many European cathedrals.&quot; After the 1983–88 genocide, some 1 million Kurds were allowed to resettle in &quot;model villages&quot;. According to a U.S. Senate staff report, these villages &quot;were poorly constructed, had minimal sanitation and water, and provided few employment opportunities for the residents. Some, if not most, were surrounded by barbed wire, and Kurds could enter or leave only with difficulty.&quot; After the establishment of republican rule in Iraq, enormous numbers of Iraqis fled the country to escape political repression by Abd al-Karim Qasim and his successors, including Saddam Hussein; by 2001, it was estimated that &quot;Iraqi emigrants number more than 3 million (leaving a population of 23 million inside the country).&quot; Nicholas Kristof of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented: &quot;Police in other countries use torture, after all, but there are credible reports that Saddam&#x27;s police cut out tongues and use electric drills. Other countries gouge out the eyes of dissidents; Saddam&#x27;s interrogators gouged out the eyes of hundreds of children to get their parents to talk.&quot;

===Number of victims===
In November 2004, Human Rights Watch estimated 250,000 to 290,000 Iraqis were killed or disappeared by the regime of Saddam Hussein including: 

The estimate of 290,000 &quot;disappeared&quot; and presumed killed includes the following: more than 100,000 Kurds killed during the 1987–88 Anfal campaign and lead-up to it; between 50,000 and 70,000 Shia arrested in the 1980s and held indefinitely without charge, who remain unaccounted for today; an estimated 8,000 males of the Barzani clan removed from resettlement camps in Iraqi Kurdistan in 1983; 10,000 or more males separated from Feyli Kurdish families deported to Iran in the 1980s; an estimated 50,000 opposition activists, including Communists and other leftists, Kurds and other minorities, and out-of-favor Ba&#x27;athists, arrested and &quot;disappeared&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s; some 30,000 Iraqi Shia men rounded up after the abortive March 1991 uprising and not heard from since; hundreds of Shia clerics and their students arrested and &quot;disappeared&quot; after 1991; several thousand Marsh Arabs who disappeared after being taken into custody during military operations in the southern marshlands; and those executed in detention-in some years several thousand-in so-called &quot;prison cleansing&quot; campaigns.
A January 2003 &quot;The New York Times&quot; article by John Fisher Burns similarly states that &quot;the number of those &#x27;disappeared&#x27; into the hands of the secret police, never to be heard from again, could be 200,000&quot; and compared Saddam to Joseph Stalin, while acknowledging that &quot;Even on a proportional basis, [Stalin&#x27;s] crimes far surpass Mr. Hussein&#x27;s.&quot; The 1988 Al-Anfal campaign resulted in the death of 50,000–100,000 Kurds (although Kurdish sources have cited a higher figure of 182,000), while 25,000–100,000 civilians and rebels were killed during the suppression of the 1991 uprisings. In addition, 4,000 prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison were reportedly executed in a particularly large 1984 purge. Far fewer Iraqis are known to have been executed during other years of Saddam&#x27;s rule. For example, &quot;Amnesty International reported that in 1981 over 350 people were officially executed in Iraq ... the Committee Against Repression in Iraq gives biographic particulars on 798 executions (along with 264 killings of unknown persons, and 428 biographies of unsentenced detainees and disappeared persons).&quot; Kanan Makiya cautions that a focus on the death toll obscures the full extent of &quot;the terror inside Iraq,&quot; which was largely the product of the pervasive secret police and systematic use of torture.

<text>Egon Petri (23 March 188127 May 1962) was a Dutch-American pianist.

== Life and career ==

Petri&#x27;s family was Dutch. He was born a Dutch citizen in Hanover, Germany, and grew up in Dresden, where he attended the Kreuzschule. His father, a professional violinist, taught him to play the violin. While still a teenager, Petri played with the Dresden Court Orchestra and with his father&#x27;s string quartet. He studied composition and theory with Hermann Kretzschmar and Felix Draeseke at the Dresden Conservatory.

From an early age Petri had also taken piano lessons and eventually, with strong encouragement from Ignacy Jan Paderewski and Ferruccio Busoni, he concentrated on piano. He studied with Busoni, who greatly influenced him, and Petri considered himself more a disciple than a student of his. Following his example, Petri focused on the works of Johann Sebastian Bach and Franz Liszt, who, along with Busoni himself, were at the centre of his repertoire.

During World War I, Petri moved with Busoni to Switzerland, where he assisted him in editing Bach&#x27;s keyboard works. In the 1920s, Petri taught in Berlin; his students included Victor Borge, Stanley Gardner, Jan Hoffman, Gunnar Johansen, Hazel Harrison, Dimitar Nenov, and Vitya Vronsky. In 1923 he became the first non-Soviet soloist to play in the Soviet Union.

In 1927 he moved to Zakopane, Poland, where, until the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he conducted summer and early-fall sessions and piano master classes. Beginning with 1929 he made recordings for several labels, including Columbia Records.

Petri escaped from Poland the day before the German invasion in September 1939, but he had to leave behind all his books, music and letters, including his correspondence with Busoni (these papers survived and were recovered).

He moved to the United States, working first at Cornell University and later at Mills College in Oakland, California. He refused ever to play in Germany again. In 1955, he became a naturalised American citizen.

Although a Dutch citizen until he was 74, he never lived in the Netherlands and was not at ease with the Dutch language. On one occasion when he performed for Queen Wilhelmina, they spoke German. He was fluent in German, English, French, Italian, Polish, and Russian.

Petri&#x27;s students included Earl Wild, Ozan Marsh, John Ogdon, Dimitar Nenov and Xenia Boodberg Lee.

Petri had a superb technique and a powerful sonority and was a superlative exponent of the larger works of Beethoven, Liszt and Brahms.

Petri died on 27 May 1962, aged 81, in Berkeley, California.

<text>Isaac Sidney Caesar (September 8, 1922 – February 12, 2014) was an American comic actor and comedian. With a career spanning 60 years, he was best known for two pioneering 1950s live television series: &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; (1950–1954), which was a 90-minute weekly show watched by 60 million people, and its successor, &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot; (1954–1957), both of which influenced later generations of comedians. &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; and its cast received seven Emmy nominations between the years 1953 and 1954 and tallied two wins. He also acted in films; he played Coach Calhoun in &quot;Grease&quot; (1978) and its sequel &quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982) and appeared in the films &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), &quot;Silent Movie&quot; (1976), &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot; (1981), &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; (1984), and &quot;Vegas Vacation&quot; (1997).

Caesar was considered a &quot;sketch comic&quot; and actor, as opposed to a stand-up comedian. He also relied more on body language, accents, and facial contortions than simply dialogue. Unlike the slapstick comedy which was standard on TV, his style was considered &quot;avant garde&quot; in the 1950s. He conjured up ideas and scene and used writers to flesh out the concept and create the dialogue. Among the writers who wrote for Caesar early in their careers were Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Larry Gelbart, Carl Reiner, Michael Stewart, Mel Tolkin, Lucille Kallen, Selma Diamond, and Woody Allen. &quot;Sid&#x27;s was the show to which all comedy writers aspired. It was the place to be,&quot; said Steve Allen.

His TV shows&#x27; subjects included satires of real life events and people, and parodies of popular film genres, theater, television shows, and opera. But unlike other comedy shows at the time, the dialogue was considered sharper, funnier, and more adult-oriented. He was &quot;best known as one of the most intelligent and provocative innovators of television comedy,&quot; who some critics called &quot;television&#x27;s Charlie Chaplin&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; refers to as the &quot;comedian of comedians from TV&#x27;s early days.&quot;

Honored in numerous ways over 60 years, he was nominated for 11 Emmy Awards, winning twice. He was also an accomplished saxophonist, having played the saxophone since he was eleven years old, and was the author of several books, including two autobiographies in which he described his career and later struggle to overcome years of alcoholism and addiction to barbiturates.

==Early life==
Caesar was born in Yonkers, New York, to a Jewish family. His father was Max Ziser (1874–1946) and his mother was Ida (née Raphael) (1887–1975). They were probably from Dąbrowa Tarnowska, Poland. Reports state that the surname &quot;Caesar&quot; was given to Max, as a child, by an immigration official at Ellis Island. According to Marian L. Smith, senior historian of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, there is no known case of a name changed at Ellis Island.

Max and Ida Caesar ran a restaurant, a 24-hour luncheonette.
By waiting on tables, their son learned to mimic the patois, rhythm, and accents of the diverse clientele, a technique he termed &quot;double-talk&quot;, which he used throughout his career. He first tried double-talk with a group of Italians, his head barely reaching above the table. They enjoyed it so much that they sent him over to a group of Poles to repeat his native-sounding patter in Polish, and so on with Russians, Hungarians, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Lithuanians, and Bulgarians. Sid Caesar&#x27;s older brother, David, was his comic mentor and &quot;one-man cheering section.&quot; They created their earliest family sketches from movies of the day like &quot;Test Pilot&quot; and the 1927 silent film &quot;Wings&quot;.

As a boy, Caesar took saxophone lessons and played in small bands to make money during the Great Depression. When he was 14, Caesar went to the Catskill Mountains as a tenor saxophonist in the Swingtime Six band and occasionally performed in sketches in the Borscht Belt.

==Career==
===Stage and film===
After graduating from Yonkers High School in 1940, Caesar left home, intent on a musical career. He arrived in Manhattan and worked as an usher and then a doorman at the Capitol Theater there. He was ineligible to join the musicians&#x27; union in New York City until he established residency, but he found work as a saxophonist at the Vacationland Hotel, a resort located in the Catskill Mountains of Sullivan County, New York. Mentored by Don Appel, the resort&#x27;s social director, Caesar played in the dance band and learned to perform comedy, doing three shows a week. He audited classes in clarinet and saxophone at the Juilliard School of Music. In 1940, he enlisted in the United States Coast Guard, and was stationed in Brooklyn, New York, where he played in military revues and shows. Caesar was discharged from the service in 1945. Vernon Duke, the composer of &quot;Autumn in New York&quot;, &quot;April in Paris&quot;, and &quot;Taking a Chance on Love&quot;, was at the same base and collaborated with Caesar on musical revues.

During the summer of 1942, Caesar met his future wife, Florence Levy, at the Avon Lodge in the Catskills village of Woodridge, New York. They were married on July 17, 1943, and had three children: Michele, Rick and Karen. After joining the musicians&#x27; union, he briefly played with Shep Fields, Claude Thornhill, Charlie Spivak, Art Mooney and Benny Goodman. Later in his career, he performed &quot;Sing, Sing, Sing&quot; with Goodman for a TV show.

Still in the military, Caesar was ordered to Palm Beach, Florida, where Vernon Duke and Howard Dietz were putting together a service revue called &quot;Tars and Spars&quot;. There he met the civilian director of the show, Max Liebman. When Caesar&#x27;s comedy got bigger applause than the musical numbers, Liebman asked him to do stand-up bits between the songs. &quot;Tars and Spars&quot; toured nationally, and became Caesar&#x27;s first major gig as a comedian. Liebman later produced Caesar&#x27;s first television series.

After finishing his military service in 1945, the Caesars moved to Hollywood. In 1946, Columbia Pictures produced a film version of &quot;Tars and Spars&quot; in which Caesar reprised his role. The next year, he acted in &quot;The Guilt of Janet Ames&quot;. He turned down the lead of &quot;The Jolson Story&quot; as he did not want to be known as an impersonator, and turned down several other offers to play sidekick roles. He soon returned to New York, where he became the opening act for Joe E. Lewis at the Copacabana nightclub. He reunited with Liebman, who guided his stage material and presentation. That job led to a contract with the William Morris Agency and a nationwide tour. Caesar also performed in a Broadway revue, &quot;Make Mine Manhattan&quot;, which featured &quot;The Five Dollar Date&quot;—one of his first original pieces, in which he sang, acted, double-talked, pantomimed, and wrote the music. He won a 1948 Donaldson Award for his contributions to the musical.

===Television===
Caesar&#x27;s television career began with an appearance on Milton Berle&#x27;s &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; in the fall of 1948. In early 1949, Caesar and Liebman met with Pat Weaver, vice president of television at NBC, which led to Caesar&#x27;s first series, &quot;Admiral Broadway Revue&quot; with Imogene Coca. The Friday show was simultaneously broadcast on NBC and the DuMont network, and it was an immediate success. However, its sponsor, Admiral, an appliance company, could not keep up with the demand for its new television sets, so the show was canceled after 26 weeks—ironically, on account of its runaway success.

On February 25, 1950, Caesar appeared in the first episode of &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, initially the second half of the two-hour umbrella show &quot;Saturday Night Review&quot;; at the end of the 1950–51 season, &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; became its own, 90-minute program from the International Theatre at 5 Columbus Circle and later The Center Theatre at Sixth Avenue and 49th Street. Burgess Meredith hosted the first two shows, and the premiere featured musical guests Gertrude Lawrence, Lily Pons and Robert Merrill. The show was a mix of sketch comedy, movie and television satires, Caesar&#x27;s monologs, musical guests, and large production numbers. Guests included: Jackie Cooper, Robert Preston, Rex Harrison, Eddie Albert, Michael Redgrave, Basil Rathbone, Charlton Heston, Geraldine Page, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Pearl Bailey, Fred Allen, Benny Goodman, Lena Horne and many other stars of the time. It was also responsible for bringing together the comedy team of Caesar, Coca, Carl Reiner, and Howard Morris. Many writers also got their break creating the show&#x27;s sketches, including Lucille Kallen, Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Michael Stewart, Mel Tolkin and Sheldon Keller. Sid Caesar won his first Emmy in 1952. In 1951 and 1952, he was voted the United States&#x27; Best Comedian in &quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot;″s TV poll. The show ended after almost 160 episodes on June 5, 1954.

A few months later, Caesar returned with &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot;, a one-hour sketch/variety show with Morris, Reiner, Bea Arthur and other members of his former crew. Nanette Fabray replaced Coca, who had left to star in her own short-lived series. Ultimate creative and technical control was now in Caesar&#x27;s hands, originating from the Center Theater and the weekly budget doubled to $125,000. The premiere on September 27, 1954, featured Gina Lollobrigida. Everything was performed live, including the commercials.

&quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot; was followed by ABC&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Sid Caesar Invites You&quot; from January 26 to May 25, 1958. It briefly reunited Caesar, Coca, and Reiner, with Simon and Brooks among the writers.

In 1963, Caesar appeared on television, on stage, and in films. Several &quot;As Caesar Sees It&quot; specials evolved into the 1963–64 &quot;Sid Caesar Show&quot; (which alternated with Edie Adams in &quot;Here&#x27;s Edie&quot;). He starred with Virginia Martin in the Broadway musical &quot;Little Me&quot;, with book by Simon, choreography by Bob Fosse, and music by Cy Coleman. Playing eight parts with 32 costume changes, he was nominated in 1963 for a Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical. On film, Caesar and Adams played a husband and wife drawn into a mad race to find buried loot in Stanley Kramer&#x27;s comedy ensemble &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963) which became a box office success and earned six Academy Award nominations.

===Style and technique===
Caesar was not a stand-up comedian but a &quot;sketch comic, and actor,&quot; wrote one historian. &quot;He conjured up ideas and enhanced scenes, but never wrote a word,&quot; and thereby depended on his writers for dialogue. Caesar was skilled at pantomime, dialects, monologs, foreign language double-talk and general comic acting.
His sketches were often long, sometimes 10 or 15 minutes, with numerous close-ups showing the expressions on the faces of Caesar and other actors. Caesar relied more on body language, accents, and facial contortions than simply spoken dialogue. Unlike slapstick comedy, which was standard on TV, his style was considered &quot;avant garde&quot;. Caesar &quot;...was born with the ability to write physical poetry,&quot; notes comedian Steve Allen, a technique like that used for a silent film comedian. An example of this &quot;silent film&quot; style is a live sketch with Nanette Fabray, where they both pantomime an argument choreographed to the music of Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony.

Writer Mel Tolkin stated that Caesar &quot;didn&#x27;t like one-line jokes in sketches because he felt that if the joke was a good one, anybody could do it. One-liners would take him away from what drove his personal approach to comedy.&quot; Larry Gelbart called Caesar&#x27;s style theatrical, and called him &quot;...a pure TV comedian.&quot; In describing his control during the live performances, actress Nanette Fabray recalled that unlike most comedians, such as Red Skelton, Bob Hope or Milton Berle, Caesar always stayed in character: &quot;He was so totally into the scene he never lost it.&quot;

Caesar was able to pantomime a wide variety of things: a tire, a gumball machine, a lion, a dog, a punching bag, a telephone, an infant, an elevator, a railroad train, a herd of horses, a piano, a rattlesnake and a bottle of seltzer. On the Dick Clark show in 1978, he played a chewing gum machine and a slot machine. He was also able to create imaginary characters. Alfred Hitchcock compared him to Charlie Chaplin, and critic John Crosby felt &quot;he could wrench laughter out of you with the violence of his great eyes and the sheer immensity of his parody.&quot; In an article in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1953, show business biographer Maurice Zolotow noted that &quot;Caesar relies upon grunts and grimaces to express a vast range of emotions.&quot;

Of his double-talk routines, Carl Reiner said, &quot;His ability to doubletalk every language known to man was impeccable,&quot; and during one performance Caesar imitated four different languages but with almost no real words. Despite his apparent fluency in many languages, Caesar could actually speak only English and Yiddish. In 2008, Caesar told a &quot;USA Today&quot; reporter, &quot;Every language has its own music ... If you listen to a language for 15 minutes, you know the rhythm and song.&quot; Having developed this mimicry skill, he could create entire monologs using gibberish in numerous languages, as he did in a skit in which he played a German general.

===Subjects===
Among his primary subjects were parodies and spoofs of various film genres, including gangster films, westerns, newspaper dramas, spy movies and other TV shows. Compared to other comedy shows at the time, the dialogue on his shows was considered sharper, funnier and more adult oriented. In his sketches for &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; and &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot;, he would also typically &quot;skewer the minutiae of domestic life&quot; along with lampooning popular or classic movies.

Contemporary movies, foreign movies, theater, television shows and opera were targets of satire by the writing team. Often the publicity generated by the sketches boosted the box office of the original productions. Some notable sketches included: &quot;From Here to Obscurity&quot; (&quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;), &quot;Aggravation Boulevard&quot; (&quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;), &quot;Hat Basterson&quot; (&quot;Bat Masterson&quot;), and &quot;No West for the Wicked&quot; (&quot;Stagecoach&quot;).

They also performed some recurring sketches. &quot;The Hickenloopers&quot;, television&#x27;s first bickering-couple sketch, predated &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;. As &quot;The Professor&quot;, Caesar was the daffy expert who bluffed his way through his interviews with earnest roving reporter Carl Reiner. In its various incarnations, &quot;The Professor&quot; could be Gut von Fraidykat (mountain-climbing expert), Ludwig von Spacebrain (space expert), or Ludwig von Henpecked (marriage expert). Later, &quot;The Professor&quot; was inspiration for Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Two Thousand Year Old Man&quot;. The most prominent recurring sketch on the show was &quot;The Commuters&quot;, which featured Caesar, Reiner, and Morris involved with everyday working and suburban life situations. Years later, the sketch &quot;Sneaking through the Sound Barrier&quot;, a parody of the British film &quot;The Sound Barrier&quot;, ran continuously as part of a display on supersonic flight at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

===Working with writers===

Steve Allen claimed, &quot;Sid&#x27;s was the show to which all comedy writers aspired. It was the place to be.&quot; While Caesar did not write his dialogue, he made all final decisions. His writers, such as Mel Brooks, felt they &quot;had a great instrument in Caesar that we could all play, and we played it very well.&quot; As for Caesar, Nachman describes him basically as an &quot;inspired idea man who allowed the writers to take more risks&quot; than other TV shows. Woody Allen remembers that &quot;...you wrote situations,&quot; instead of jokes, as in &quot;This Is Your Story&quot; with Carl Reiner, a parody of the popular TV show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. It was said to be &quot;Caesar&#x27;s personal favorite&quot; sketch.

In many cases, sketch dialogue was not even written down, but simply indicated by describing a scene, as in, &quot;Sid does man coming home from business mad.&quot; Sometimes, said Larry Gelbart, it was &quot;organized chaos,&quot; and when watching the writers create from offstage, felt, &quot;...it was a religious experience.&quot; To Mel Brooks, &quot;it was a zoo. Everyone pitched lines at Sid. Jokes would be changed fifty times.&quot; Naturally there were some explosive episodes: &quot;Mr. Caesar once dangled a terrified Mr. Brooks from an 18th-story window until colleagues restrained him. With one punch, he knocked out a horse that had thrown his wife off its back, a scene that Mr. Brooks replayed in his movie &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;.&quot;

Neil Simon recalled that after writing out a sketch and giving it to Caesar, &quot;Sid would make it ten times funnier than what we wrote. Sid acted everything out, so the sketches we did were like little plays.&quot; Simon also remembered the impact that working for Caesar had on him: &quot;The first time I saw Caesar it was like seeing a new country. All other comics were basically doing situations with farcical characters. Caesar was doing life.&quot;

Some of his writers, like Woody Allen, initially didn&#x27;t like being among the large team of writers coming up with routines for Caesar, feeling it was too competitive and contributed to hostility among writers. An Allen biographer wrote that Allen &quot;...chafed under the atmosphere of inspired spontaneity&quot;, although Allen did say that, &quot;Writing for Caesar was the highest thing you could aspire to—at least as a TV comedy writer. Only the presidency was above that.&quot; Neil Simon noted that &quot;we were competitive the way a family is competitive to get dad&#x27;s attention. We all wanted to be Sid&#x27;s favorite.&quot; As part of the competitive atmosphere in &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Room&quot;, as it was called, friendship was also critical. Larry Gelbart explained:

===Impact on television===
Nachman concludes that &quot;the Caesar shows were the crème de la crème of fifties television,&quot; as they were &quot;studded with satire, and their sketches sharper, edgier, more sophisticated than the other variety shows.&quot; Likewise, historian Susan Murray notes that Caesar was &quot;...best known as one of the most intelligent and provocative innovators of television comedy.&quot;

According to actress Nanette Fabray, who acted alongside Caesar, &quot;He was the first original TV comedy creation.&quot; His early shows were the &quot;...gold standard for TV sketch comedy.&quot; In 1951, &quot;Newsweek&quot; noted that according to &quot;the opinion of lots of smart people, Caesar is the best that TV has to offer,&quot; while Zolotow, in his 1953 profile for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, wrote that &quot;in temperament, physique, and technique of operation, Caesar represents a new species of comedian.&quot;

However, his positive impact on television became a negative one for Broadway. Caesar fans preferred to stay home on Saturday nights to watch his show instead of seeing live plays. &quot;The Caesar show became such a Saturday-night must-see habit—the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; of its day,&quot; states Nachman, that &quot;...Broadway producers begged NBC to switch the show to midweek.&quot; Comedy star Carol Burnett, who later had her own hit TV show, remembers winning tickets to see &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; on Broadway: &quot;I gave the tickets to my roommate because I said, &quot;Fair Lady&#x27;s&quot; gonna be running for a hundred years, but Sid Caesar is live and I&#x27;ll never see &quot;that&quot; again.&quot;

===Faded success and personal problems===
After nearly 10 years as a prime-time star of television comedy with &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; followed by &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot;, his stardom ended rapidly and he nearly disappeared from the spotlight. Nachman describes this period:

Caesar himself felt, &quot;It had all come too fast, was too easy, and he didn&#x27;t deserve the acclaim.&quot; Writer Mel Brooks, who also became his close friend, said, &quot;I know of no other comedian, including Chaplin, who could have done nearly ten years of live television. Nobody&#x27;s talent was ever more used up than Sid&#x27;s. He was one of the greatest artists ever born. But over a period of years, television ground him into sausages.&quot;

In 1977, after blacking out during a stage performance of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot; in Regina, Saskatchewan, Caesar gave up alcohol &quot;cold turkey&quot;. In his 1982 autobiography, &quot;Where Have I Been?&quot;, and his second book, &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hours&quot;, he chronicled his struggle to overcome his alcoholism and addiction to sleeping pills.

===Later years===
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Caesar continued to make occasional television and theatrical appearances and starred in several movies including &quot;Silent Movie&quot; and &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot; (both reuniting him with Mel Brooks), &quot;Airport 1975&quot;, and as Coach Calhoun in &quot;Grease&quot; and its sequel &quot;Grease 2&quot; in 1982. In 1971, he starred opposite Carol Channing and a young Tommy Lee Jones in the Broadway show &quot;Four on a Garden&quot;.

In 1973, Caesar reunited with Imogene Coca for the stage play &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot;, written in 1971 by Neil Simon. Their play opened in Chicago in August 1973. That same year, Caesar and Max Liebman mined their own personal kinescopes from &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; (NBC had lost the studio copies) and they produced the feature film &quot;Ten From Your Show of Shows&quot;, a compilation of some of their best sketches. In 1974, Caesar said, &quot;I&#x27;d like to be back every week&quot; on TV and appeared in the NBC skit-based comedy television pilot called &quot;Hamburgers&quot;.
In 1980, he appeared as a double-talking Japanese father for Mei and Kei&#x27;s Pink Lady and opposite Jeff Altman in the &quot;Pink Lady and Jeff&quot; show.

In 1983, Caesar hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where he received a standing ovation at the start of the show and was awarded a plaque at the conclusion of the show declaring him an honorary cast member. He released an exercise video, &quot;Sid Caesar&#x27;s Shape Up!&quot;, in 1985. In 1987–89, Caesar appeared as Frosch the Jailer in &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. In 1987, Caesar starred in the David Irving film &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; with Robert Morse as the Tailor. Caesar remained active by appearing in movies, television and award shows, including the movie &quot;The Great Mom Swap&quot; in 1995.

In 1996, the Writers Guild of America, West reunited Caesar with nine of his writers from &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; and &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot; for a two-hour panel discussion featuring head writer Mel Tolkin, Caesar, Carl Reiner, Aaron Ruben, Larry Gelbart, Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Danny Simon, Sheldon Keller, and Gary Belkin. The event was taped, broadcast on PBS in the United States and the BBC in the UK, and later released as a DVD titled &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Writers&quot;.

In 1997, he made a guest appearance in &quot;Vegas Vacation&quot; and, the following year, in &quot;The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit&quot; based on a Ray Bradbury novel. Also that year, Caesar joined fellow television icons Bob Hope and Milton Berle at the 50th anniversary of the Primetime Emmy Awards. Billy Crystal also paid tribute to Caesar that night when he won an Emmy for hosting that year&#x27;s Oscar telecast, recalling seeing Caesar doing a parody of Yul Brynner in &quot;The King &amp; I&quot; on &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;. Caesar performed his double-talk in a &quot;foreign dub&quot; skit on the November 21, 2001, episode of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;

On September 7, 2001, Caesar, Carl Reiner and Nanette Fabray appeared on CNN&#x27;s live interview program &quot;Larry King Live&quot; along with actor, comedian and improvisationist Drew Carey.

In 2003, he joined Edie Adams and Marvin Kaplan at a 40th anniversary celebration for &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;. In 2004, Caesar&#x27;s second autobiography, &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hours&quot;, was published, and in 2006, Billy Crystal presented Caesar with the TV Land Awards&#x27; Pioneer Award. In what TV Land called &quot;...a hilarious, heartfelt, multilingual, uncut acceptance speech,&quot; Caesar performed his double-talk for over five minutes.

In a November 2009 article in the Toluca Lake, California, &quot;Tolucan Times&quot;, columnist Greg Crosby described a visit with Caesar and his wife Florence at their home. Of the couple&#x27;s meeting, Florence said, &quot;Well, I thought he was nice for the summer ... I thought he would be just a nice boyfriend for the summer. He was cute-looking and tall, over six feet... I was in my last year at Hunter College; we were still dating when Sid went into the service, the Coast Guard. Luckily he was stationed in New York so we were able to continue seeing each other, even though my parents weren&#x27;t too happy about it. They never thought he would amount to anything, that he&#x27;d never have a real career or make any money. But we were married one year after we met, in July of 1943.&quot; She also pointed out, &quot;You know, he&#x27;s not funny all the time. He can be very serious.&quot; At the time of the interview, the couple had been married for 66 years. Florence Caesar died on March 3, 2010, aged 88.

==Personal life==
Caesar was married to Florence Levy for 67 years until her death in 2010. Caesar asserted that he was &quot;proud to be Jewish&quot; and that &quot;Jews have a good sense of humor. Jews appreciate humor because in their life it&#x27;s not too funny. We&#x27;ve been trodden down for a long time, thousands of years. So we&#x27;ve had to turn that around because if you take it all too seriously you&#x27;re going to eat yourself. And we&#x27;re very good at being self-deprecating. Either we do it or somebody&#x27;s going to do it for us. We might as well do it first.&quot;

==Death==
Caesar died on February 12, 2014, at his home in Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 91, after a short illness.

On Caesar&#x27;s death, Carl Reiner said, &quot;He was the ultimate, he was the very best sketch artist and comedian that ever existed.&quot; Mel Brooks commented, &quot;Sid Caesar was a giant, maybe the best comedian who ever practiced the trade. And I was privileged to be one of his writers and one of his friends.&quot; Woody Allen stated, &quot;He was one of the truly great comedians of my time&quot;. Jon Stewart and &quot;The Daily Show&quot; paid tribute to Caesar at the show&#x27;s close on February 12, 2014. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; republished a brief tribute written by Billy Crystal in August 2005, in which he said of Caesar and his contemporaries:

His interment was at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery. He was predeceased by his wife, Florence (2010) and survived by his children Karen, Michelle, and Rick, and two grandsons. His son, Dr. Richard (Rick) Caesar died several months after his father on July 16, 2014.

<text>Your Show of Shows is a live 90-minute variety show that was broadcast weekly in the United States on NBC from February 25, 1950, through June 5, 1954, featuring Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca. Other featured performers were Carl Reiner, Howard Morris, Bill Hayes, baritone singer Jack Russell, Judy Johnson, the Hamilton Trio and the soprano Marguerite Piazza. José Ferrer made several guest appearances on the series.

The show has been featured in several lists of the greatest television series. Most of the series has been preserved to some extent, but only some sketches have been released on home video.

==Production==
The 90-minute live series was produced by Sylvester &quot;Pat&quot; Weaver and directed by Max Liebman, who had been producing musical revues at the Tamiment resort in the Pocono Mountains for many years prior. Caesar, Coca, and Liebman had worked on &quot;Admiral Broadway Revue&quot; from January to June 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1982/books/funny-man-story&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The series originated as the second half of a two-hour umbrella show, &quot;Saturday Night Review&quot;, with the first portion hosted by comedian Jack Carter in Chicago, Illinois, and the remainder telecast from the since-demolished International Theatre (also known as the Park Theatre) at 5 Columbus Circle and the Center Theatre in Manhattan, New York City. The Chicago portion was dropped at the end of the 1950–51 season, and the series became the 90-minute &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;.

Writers for the series included Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Danny Simon, Mel Tolkin, Lucille Kallen, Selma Diamond, Joseph Stein, Michael Stewart, Tony Webster (the only Gentile among the show&#x27;s writers), and Carl Reiner who, though a cast member, also worked with the writers. The series is historically significant for the evolution of the variety genre by incorporating situation comedies (sitcoms) such as the running sketch &quot;The Hickenloopers&quot;; this added a narrative element to the traditional multi-act structure. James Starbuck was the resident choreographer for the show, and often appeared as a featured dancer opposite Coca in parodies of classic ballets of his creation.

As author Ted Sennett described, stars Caesar, Coca, Carl Reiner, and Howard Morris
Coca recalled,
A common misconception is that Larry Gelbart wrote for &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;; in fact, he wrote for its successor program, &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot;, which was broadcast from 1954 to 1957. Likewise, Woody Allen did not write for &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, as he worked only on several Sid Caesar TV series and specials from 1956 forward.

Carl Reiner has stated that the time he spent on &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; was the inspiration for &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; also inspired the 1982 movie &quot;My Favorite Year&quot;, produced by Mel Brooks, and the 1993 play &quot;Laughter on the 23rd Floor&quot; written by Neil Simon.

The series was noted for its array of glamorous dancers, including Joy Langstaff, Pauline Goddard, and Virginia Curtis.

By the 1953–1954 season, although the ratings had slipped a little, &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; remained extremely popular with viewers. However, in the spring of 1954, it was decided to break up the comedy team of Caesar and Coca and, beginning in the fall of 1954, sign them to star in their own individual variety series on NBC. As a result, &quot;Your Show Of Shows&quot; ended its network run on June 5, 1954. At the end of that episode, NBC president &quot;Pat&quot; Weaver came out at the curtain call to congratulate the cast on their four-year-four-month run and personally to wish Caesar and Coca great success in their future endeavors.

The summer replacement for &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; in 1953 and 1954 was &quot;Saturday Night Review&quot;.

== Sketches ==
The show featured several regular musical sketches, such as the mock rock group The Three Haircuts (Caesar, Reiner, and Morris), a vocal trio who always sang in unison and usually bellowed the lyrics. In 1955 RCA Victor recorded and rush-released two songs from the show, &quot;You Are So Rare to Me&quot; and &quot;Goin&#x27; Crazy&quot;, accompanied by Joe Reisman and his orchestra.

==Preservation==
The kinescopes of the series were retained by Max Liebman; from those shows, a 1973 theatrical film titled &quot;Ten from Your Show of Shows&quot; was compiled which featured ten sketches. In 1976, this was followed by a half-hour syndicated series.

The Paley Center for Media in Manhattan and Beverly Hills, California, holds an almost complete set of the series, and a set of master tapes of the 1976 syndicated series.

In 2000, a cache of original scripts from the show were found in a closet of producer Max Liebman, in the City Center building in New York City. The find made the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. A former employee of Liebman, Barry Jacobsen, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; he had left the scripts in the closet and was holding onto the key until he could come back to decide how to dispose of them.

After the program ended the Caesar-Coca team was effectively split into two successor programs the following season: Imogene Coca starred in &quot;The Imogene Coca Show&quot; (which lasted one season), and Sid Caesar starred in &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot;, which retained much of the cast and staff of &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;.

==Syndication and DVD release==
Reruns of the 1976 syndicated &quot;best of&quot; series were aired on Comedy Central during the early 1990s. Skits from the series which are from Sid Caesar&#x27;s personal collection are available on &quot;The Sid Caesar Collection&quot; DVD set.

<text>Arista Records ( ) is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment, a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America, the American division of the Japanese conglomerate Sony. The label was previously a division of Bertelsmann Music Group, the North American division of German conglomerate Bertelsmann. Founded in November 1974 by Clive Davis and deactivated in 2011, Arista was re-established in 2018. Along with RCA Records, Columbia Records, and Epic Records, it is one of Sony Music&#x27;s four flagship record labels.

== History ==

=== Background ===
After being fired from CBS Records, Clive Davis was recruited by Alan Hirschfield, then-CEO of Columbia Pictures, in June 1974 to be a consultant for the company&#x27;s record and music operations. Shortly after his hiring by CPI, Davis became president of Bell Records, replacing the departing Larry Uttal.

Davis&#x27;s real goal was to reorganize and revitalize Columbia Pictures&#x27;s music division. With a $10 million investment by CPI, and a reorganization of the various Columbia Pictures legacy labels (Colpix, Colgems, and Bell), Davis introduced Columbia Pictures&#x27; new record division, Arista Records, in November 1974, ultimately owning 20 percent of the company.

The label was named after Arista, New York City&#x27;s public secondary school honor society (of which Davis was a member at Erasmus Hall High School).

In early 1975, most of the artists who had been signed to Bell were let go, including David Cassidy (who left for RCA Records), Tony Orlando and Dawn (who left for Elektra Records), and the 5th Dimension (which departed for ABC Records). Others, such as Suzi Quatro and Hot Chocolate, were farmed out to the Bell/Arista-distributed label, Big Tree. Several Bell acts, such as Barry Manilow, the Bay City Rollers, and Melissa Manchester continued with Arista.

The British Bell label kept that name for a couple of years before changing its name to Arista. The label was mentioned in the 1978 Nick Lowe song &quot;They Called It Rock&quot;, in the lyric, &quot;Arista says they love you/But the kids can&#x27;t dance to this.&quot;

Arista signed the Grateful Dead in 1976, and the group released their only Top 40 pop hit, &quot;Touch of Grey&quot;, on the label in 1987. In addition to Outlaws, Patti Smith, Eric Carmen, Air Supply, the Kinks, Lou Reed, Alan Parsons and Dionne Warwick, Arista signed Aretha Franklin in 1980, after her long relationship with Atlantic Records ended. The label&#x27;s most significant acquisition came in 1983 when Davis signed Whitney Houston. Houston would become Arista&#x27;s biggest-selling recording act and one of the best-selling acts in music history with sales of over 220 million records worldwide, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

=== Subsidiary imprint labels ===
Arista had an imprint label in the 1970s called Arista Novus, which focused on contemporary jazz artists. It distributed two other jazz labels, Arista Freedom, which specialized in avant-garde jazz and, until 1982, GRP Records, which specialized in contemporary jazz and what came to be known as smooth jazz. A country music division, Career Records, was merged into the Arista Nashville division in 1997. Arista Austin was used in the late 1990s as a country label. Arista Texas (later Arista Latin) was used in the mid to late 1990s as a Tejano/Regional Mexican label. Additionally, Arista was the U.S. distributor of Jive Records from 1981 until 1987. During the 1990s, Arista also distributed Logic, Rowdy and Heavenly Recordings.

=== Acquisitions, sell-offs ===
Looking to stave off bankruptcy, Columbia Pictures sold Arista to German-based Ariola Records, a unit of Bertelsmann, on July 27, 1979; the acquisition was completed on October 1 of that year. After Arista lost $12 million in 1982, Bertelsmann sold a 50% interest in the company to RCA Records in 1983. In 1985, RCA and Bertelsmann merged their music operations to form RCA/Ariola International; RCA owned 75% and Bertelsmann owned the remaining 25%.

After General Electric absorbed the RCA Corporation in 1986, GE sold off various RCA assets, including all of its interest in RCA/Ariola to Bertelsmann, and it was renamed Bertelsmann Music Group, though Arista&#x27;s U.S. releases would not note BMG until 1987. That year, in 1987, Arista Records formed a home video subsidiary, 6 West Home Video, in order to release home video titles on Arista Records&#x27; musical catalog, and the initial release, which served as the first title for the 6 West Home Video division was a one-hour performance on The Grateful Dead, &quot;So Far&quot;, with an October release and a list price of $29.95.

Into the 1980s, Arista continued its success, including major UK act Secret Affair. Over the years it acquired Northwestside Records, deConstruction Records, First Avenue Records, and Dedicated Records in the UK. In 1989, Arista entered into a joint venture with Antonio &quot;L.A.&quot; Reid and Babyface in the creation of LaFace Records, record company of Toni Braxton, Usher, Outkast, and TLC, which it acquired in 1999. In 1993, Arista also entered into a joint-venture with Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs to form Bad Boy Records. In 1997, Arista acquired Profile Records, the home of Run-D.M.C. and Poor Righteous Teachers.

=== Milli Vanilli controversy ===
In 1989, Arista Records signed Milli Vanilli, a contemporary R&amp;B duo consisting of Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan that was based in Germany. The label released its debut album, &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot;, which was a remixed and re-edited version of &quot;All or Nothing&quot;, which had been out in Europe the previous year. The album was certified sextuple platinum in the U.S., and charted five top-ten singles, three of them reaching the number one position. In 1990, Milli Vanilli won two American Music Awards and a Grammy Award for Best New Artist.

Carol Decker, lead singer of the band T&#x27;Pau, was interviewed after their performance on MTV and said that Milli Vanilli had used a Synclavier and were not singing. Later that year, Frank Farian, producer of Milli Vanilli, confirmed that the duo had not performed a &quot;single note&quot; on their album.

This revelation caused a huge firestorm in the music industry, as recording artists, particularly bubblegum pop acts that heavily relied on electronic processing and overdubbing (what they referred to as &quot;studio magic&quot;), were now under scrutiny and subsequently forced to cut back on lip-synching to show that they were authentic. Milli Vanilli&#x27;s Grammy Award was subsequently revoked. Clive Davis promptly released the duo from its contract and deleted the album and its masters from their catalogue—making &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot; the largest-selling album to be deleted.A court ruling in the U.S. allowed anyone who had bought the album to get a refund.

In response to the scandal, Arista&#x27;s position was that the company had been completely unaware of Morvan and Pilatus having not themselves recorded their album. In a post-debacle interview, Morvan defended himself for his part in the deception by saying: &quot;[Before Milli Vanilli] I was working at a McDonald&#x27;s. What would you have done?&quot;

=== Reconstructing Arista and the L.A. Reid years ===
At the end of the year 2000, following its 25th anniversary, BMG fired Davis as president/CEO due to age restrictions. Although Davis was still one of the most successful record heads in the entire music industry, BMG had an age restriction policy. L.A. Reid succeeded Davis as Arista&#x27;s president/CEO.

Under Reid, the label had success with newer acts such as Avril Lavigne, Pink, and Kelis, but struggled with newer releases by more established acts already on the label. Reid seemed to lose focus and have many miscalculations when it came to promoting Arista&#x27;s established acts such as TLC, Toni Braxton, Whitney Houston (Houston being BMG&#x27;s biggest selling act out of all BMG labels), and several other acts.

Reid seemed to put more money in promoting newer acts and less money into promoting established acts. Whitney Houston&#x27;s December 2002, &quot;Just Whitney&quot;, as well as her November 2003 album &quot;One Wish: The Holiday Album&quot; failed to achieve the same success as her previous albums with Davis as head of Arista. Reid&#x27;s extravagant spending, meanwhile, and lower sales of big-name established acts under his tenure, caused Arista to lose money. In two years, with Reid as CEO of Arista, Arista lost over $100 million.

After BMG and Sony Music Entertainment merged in 2004, Reid was fired in January of that year. Arista, always an independently managed front line label at BMG, was merged with J Records in August 2005; J Records being the label that Davis started after being fired by BMG.

The merged Arista and J record labels began operating under the newly formed RCA Music Group—of which Davis was re-instated as CEO after the merger of BMG and Sony, thus Davis once again became in control of Arista and several other labels from the very company that previously fired him.

The Arista label continued to be used for new releases, although heavily scaled back, while its reissues are released through Sony Music&#x27;s Legacy Recordings. Also, as a result of the Sony-BMG merger, Arista once again became related to Columbia Pictures, which is fully owned by the Sony Corporation of America (through Sony Pictures Entertainment) – who would buy out BMG&#x27;s share in 2008.

=== Dissolution and revival ===
After the Sony-BMG merger, LaFace Records was eventually revived; the label was now fully owned by Sony-BMG and began operating as part of the Jive Label Group.

During the summer of 2011, the RCA Music Group underwent a restructuring that saw the elimination of the Arista name later on that year, along with sister labels J Records and Jive. RCA Records started releasing all RCA Music Group releases under RCA Records. Arista Nashville continued to operate through Sony Music Nashville and was not affected by the closing of Arista Records.

Arista Records France was founded in September 2012, making it initially the last active remnant of the label, In 2023, Sony Music France closed Arista Records France, with the existing roster transferring to other labels under Sony&#x27;s ownership.

In July 2018, it was announced that Arista would be revived as a frontline label, making it now the fourth flagship record label under Sony Music alongside Columbia, RCA, and Epic. The company hired former Island Records president/CEO David Massey to lead Arista. The label signed Mike Posner ahead of his new album in 2025.

== Arista Nashville ==

In 1989, Arista Records launched Arista Nashville, which specializes in country music artists. Alan Jackson was the first act signed label. In 1995, Arista Nashville launched a subsidiary label known as Career Records, the roster of which at the time included Brett James, Tammy Graham, and Lee Roy Parnell. Currently, Arista Nashville falls under the wing of Sony Music Nashville, hosting such artists as Carrie Underwood, Ronnie Dunn and Jerrod Niemann.

In March 2023, Arista Nashville was closed, with its roster reassigned under other Sony Music labels.

<text>The School of Names, or School of Forms and Names, is a school of thought in Chinese philosophy that grew out of Mohist logic. Sometimes termed Logicians, “dialecticians” or sophists modernly, Han scholars used it in reference to figures earlier termed Disputers in the Zhuangzi, as a view seemingly dating back to the Warring States period (221 BC). Rather than a unified movement like the Mohists, it represents a &quot;social category&quot; of early linguistic debaters. Some arguments in later, more orthodox Mohist texts, with their own logicians, would appear directed at their kind of debates. Figures associated with it include Deng Xi, Yin Wen, Hui Shi, and Gongsun Long. A Three Kingdoms era figure, Xu Gan, is relevant for discussions of names and realities, but was more Confucian and less philosophically relativist.

Including figures referenced by the Zhuangzi, some likely served as a bridge between Mohism and the relativism of Zhuangzi Daoism. Hui Shi is noted for relativism, but also &quot;embracing the ten thousand things&quot;. But he may not have had much connection with Gongsun Long, and they would have had backgrounds ranging from Mohist and Confucian to Daoistic. Gongsun Long is familiar with both Mohism and Confucianism, and is not always a relativist. He uses Confucianism to defend the White Horse Dialogue, believed in kindness and duty, and has a rectification of names doctrine aimed at actualities and social order. Willing to argue either side of an issue, they were taken as &quot;sophist&quot; by their critics, but some arguments were not necessarily intended to be paradoxical.

A contemporary of Confucius and the younger Mozi, Deng Xi, associated with litigation, is taken by Liu Xiang as the originator of the principle of , or ensuring that ministers&#x27; deeds (&quot;xing&quot;) harmonized with their words (&quot;ming&quot;). A primary concern of the bureaucratically oriented Shen Buhai and Han Fei, some of their administrators would have had a concern for relations in the bureaucracy. With Gongsun Long as example, most were still likely more socially and philosophically oriented than the late, stringent Han Feizi; it cannot be assumed that many were familiar with Shang Yang.

== Overview ==
The earliest literary occurrence for xingming is in the &quot;Zhan Guo Ce&quot;, in reference to what would become known as the School of Names amongst other more modern terms; Chris Fraser (Stanford Encyclopedia) modernly argues &quot;Disputers&quot; a more &quot;appropriate&quot; English label.

The philosophy of the Logicians is often considered to be akin to those of the sophists or of the dialecticians. One of the few surviving lines from the school, &quot;a one-foot stick, every day take away half of it, in a myriad ages it will not be exhausted&quot;, resembles Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes. However, some of their other aphorisms seem contradictory or unclear when taken out of context, for example, &quot;dogs are not hounds&quot;. Joseph Needham notes that their works have been lost, except for the partially preserved oeuvre of Gongsun Long, and the paradoxes of Chapter 33 of the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, considering the disappearance of the greater part of Gongsun Long&#x27;s work one of the worst losses in the ancient Chinese books, as what remains is said to reach the highest point of ancient Chinese philosophical writing.

As with the Legalists, Sinologist Kidder Smith highlights the mixed posthumous reception received by the school of names. Already opposed by the Later Mohists (who have also sometimes been termed &quot;logicians&quot;) in their own era for their paradoxes, many of them, despite being remembered as sophists, would also have been administrators. Hui Shi was a prime minister, while Gongsun Long was a diplomat and peace activist, as typical of the Mohists. Although not classed under it, while Shen Buhai may not have been familiar with his contemporary Shang Yang in the remote Qin state, he likely was familiar with central Chinese &quot;school of names&quot; type debates on language and the correlation between the names and realities of things, with language useful in administration.

==Shen Buhai==
In the Han dynasty secretaries of government who had charge of the records of decisions in criminal matters would come to be called called &quot;xingming&quot;. The Han-era scholars Sima Qian () and Liu Xiang (77–6 BC) attribute the doctrine of Xing-Ming back to Shen Buhai (400). According to the Han Feizi, Shen Buhai actually used the older, more philosophically common equivalent, ming-shi, or name and reality, linking the origination of their administrative method, or &quot;doctrine of names&quot;, with the debates of the neo-Mohists and school of names. Such discussions are prominent in the &quot;Han Feizi&quot;.

&quot;Ming&quot; (&#x27;name&#x27;) sometimes has the sense of &quot;speech&quot;, so as to compare the statements of an aspiring officer with the reality of his actions—or of &quot;reputation&quot;, again compared with real conduct (&quot;xing&quot; &#x27;form&#x27; or &quot;shi&quot; &#x27;reality&#x27;). Two anecdotes in the &quot;Han Feizi&quot; provide examples—member of the School of Names Ni Yue argued that a white horse is not a horse, and defeated all debaters, but was still tolled at the gate. In another, the chief minister of Yan pretended to see a white horse dash out the gate. All of his subordinates denied having seen anything, save one, who ran out after it and returned claiming to have seen it, and was thereby identified as a flatterer.

Shen Buhai&#x27;s personnel control, or rectification of names, with &quot;names&quot; representing ministrial claims, thereby worked for &quot;strict performance control&quot;, correlating claims, performances and posts. It would become a central tenet of both the Han Feizi&#x27;s statecraft and other so-called &#x27;Huang–Lao&#x27; derivatives. Rather than having to look for &quot;good&quot; men, &quot;mingshi&quot; or &quot;xingming&quot; can seek the right man for a particular post, though doing so implies a total organizational knowledge of the regime. More simply though, it can allow ministers to &quot;name&quot; themselves through accounts of specific cost and time frame, leaving their definition to competing ministers. Claims or utterances &quot;bind the speaker to the realization a job&quot;. This was the doctrine favoured by Han Fei, with subtle differences. Favoring exactness, the correct articulation of &quot;ming&quot; or terms is considered crucial to the realization of projects, combatting the tendency to promise too much.

<doc id="202693" wikidata="Q1362266" url="?curid=202693" title="Gongsun Long">
<text>Gongsun Long (250 BC), courtesy name Zibing, was a Chinese philosopher, writer, and member of the School of Names, also known as the Logicians, of ancient Chinese philosophy. Gongsun ran a school and received patronage from rulers, advocating peaceful means of resolving disputes amid the martial culture of the Warring States period. His collected works comprise the &quot;Gongsun Longzi&quot; () anthology. Comparatively few details are known about his life, and much of his work has been lost—only six of the fourteen essays he originally authored are still extant.

In book 17 of the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, Gongsun speaks of himself:

When young, I studied the way of the former kings. When I grew up, I understood the practice of kindness and duty. I united the same and different, separated hard from white, made so the not-so and admissible the inadmissible. I confounded the wits of the hundred schools and exhausted the eloquence of countless speakers. I took myself to have reached the ultimate.

He is best known for a series of paradoxes in the tradition of Hui Shi, including &quot;white horses are not horses&quot;, &quot;when no thing is not the pointed-out, to point out is not to point out&quot;, and &quot;there is no 1 in 2&quot;. These paradoxes seem to suggest a similarity to the discovery in Greek philosophy that pure logic may lead to apparently absurd conclusions.

== Rectification of names ==

Although not done justice by English translation, professor Zhenbin Sun considers Gongsun Long’s work on ming-shi, or name and reality, the most &quot;profound and systematic&quot; of the School of Names. As Gongsun Long enjoys the favor or rulers, his work also concerns social order.

The Gongsun Long Zi reads:
Heaven, earth, and their products are all things [物 wu]. When things possess the characteristics of things without exceeding them, there is actuality [shi]. When actuality actually fulfills its function as actuality, without wanting, there is order [位 wei]. To be out of order is to fall into disorder. To remain in order is to be correct. What is correct is used to rectify what is incorrect. [What is incorrect is not used to] doubt what is correct. To rectify is to rectify actuality, and to rectify the name [ming] corresponding to it.

==White Horse dialogue==
In the &quot;White Horse Dialogue&quot; (), one interlocutor (sometimes called the &quot;sophist&quot;) defends the truth of the statement &quot;White horses are not horses,&quot; while the other interlocutor (sometimes called the &quot;objector&quot;) disputes the truth of this statement. This has been interpreted in a number of ways.

Possibly the simplest interpretation is to see it as based on a confusion of class and identity. The argument, by this interpretation, plays upon an ambiguity of the negative copula &quot;is not&quot; (非). The expression &quot;X is not Y&quot; (X非Y) can mean either
* &quot;X is not a member (or subset) of set Y&quot;
* &quot;X is not identical to Y&quot;

The sentence &quot;White horses are not horses&quot; would normally be taken to assert the obviously false claim that white horses are not part of the group of horses. However, the &quot;sophist&quot; in the dialogue defends the statement under the interpretation, &quot;Not all horses are white horses&quot;. The latter statement is actually true, since—as the &quot;sophist&quot; explains—&quot;horses&quot; includes horses that are white, yellow, brown, etc., while &quot;white horses&quot; includes only white horses, and excludes the others. A.C. Graham proposed this interpretation and illustrated it with an analogy. The &quot;Objector&quot; assumes that &quot;a white horse is not a horse&quot; is parallel to &quot;a sword is not a weapon,&quot; but the &quot;Sophist&quot; is treating the statement as parallel to &quot;a sword is not a blade.&quot; Other interpretations have been put forward by Fung Yu-lan and Chad Hansen, among others.

This work has been viewed by some as a serious logical discourse, by others as a facetious work of sophistry, and finally by some as a combination of the two.

==Other works==
He was also responsible for several other essays (), as short as 300 characters.
* &quot;On Pointing at Things&quot; (): An enigmatic discussion on reference and the referent, or designation and the designated.
* &quot;On Understanding Change&quot; ()
* &quot;On Hardness and Whiteness&quot; (): based on the example of a stone that is both hard and white.
* &quot;On Name and Substance&quot; ()
* &quot;Storehouse of Traces&quot; ()

<doc id="202696" wikidata="Q721207" url="?curid=202696" title="Marina">
<text>A marina (from Spanish , Portuguese and Italian : &quot;related to the sea&quot;) is a dock or basin with moorings and supplies for yachts and small boats.
A marina differs from a port in that a marina does not handle large passenger ships or cargo from freighters.

The word &quot;marina&quot; may also refer to an inland wharf on a river or canal that is used exclusively by non-industrial pleasure craft such as canal narrowboats.

==Emplacement==
Marinas may be located along the banks of rivers connecting to lakes or seas and may be inland.
They are also located on coastal harbors (natural or man made) or coastal lagoons, either as stand alone facilities or within a port complex.

==History==
In the 19th century, the few existing pleasure craft shared the same facilities as trading and fishing vessels. The marina appeared in the 20th century with the popularization of yachting.

==Facilities and services==
A marina may have refuelling, washing and repair facilities, marine and boat chandlers, stores and restaurants.
A marina may include ground facilities such as parking lots for vehicles and boat trailers. Slipways (or boat ramps) transfer a trailered boat into the water.
A marina may have a travel lift, a specialised crane used for lifting heavier boats out of the water and transporting them around the hard stand. A marina may provide in- or out-of-water boat storage.

Fee-based services such as parking, use of picnic areas, pubs, and clubhouses for showers are usually included in long-term rental agreements. Visiting yachtsmen usually have the option of buying each amenity from a fixed schedule of fees; arrangements can be as wide as a single use, such as a shower, or several weeks of temporary berthing. The right to use the facilities is frequently extended at overnight or period rates to visiting yachtsmen.
Since marinas are often limited by available space, it may take years on a waiting list to get a permanent berth.

==Moorings and access==

Boats are moored on buoys, on fixed or floating walkways tied to an anchoring piling by a roller or ring mechanism (floating docks, pontoons).
Buoys are cheaper to rent but less convenient than being able to walk from land to boat. Harbor shuttles (water taxis) or launches, may transfer people between the shore and boats moored on buoys.
The alternative is a tender such as an inflatable boat. Facilities offering fuel, boat ramps and stores will normally have a common-use dock set aside for such short term parking needs.

Where the tidal range is large, marinas may use locks to maintain the water level for several hours before and after low water.

==Economic organisation==

Marinas may be owned and operated by a private club, especially yacht clubs — but also as private enterprises or municipal facilities. Marinas may be standalone private businesses, components of a resort, or owned and operated by public entities.

The unstable situation and the war in neighbouring Afghanistan and Iraq prompted a rush of refugees into the country who arrived in their millions, with Tehran being a magnet for much seeking work, who subsequently helped the city to recover from war wounds, working for far less pay than local construction workers. Many of these refugees are being repatriated with the assistance of the UNHCR, but there are still sizable groups of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in Tehran who are reluctant to leave, being pessimistic about the situation in their own countries. Afghan refugees are mostly Dari-speaking Tajik and Hazara, speaking a variety of Persian, and Iraqi refugees are mainly Mesopotamian Arabic-speakers who are often of Iranian and Persian ethnic heritage.

<text>Shahre Ray, Shahr-e Ray, Shahre Rey, or Shahr-e Rey (, ) or simply Ray or Rey (), is the capital of Rey County in Tehran Province, Iran. Formerly a distinct city, it has now been absorbed into the metropolitan area of Greater Tehran as the 20th district of municipal Tehran, the capital city of the country.

Historically known as Rhages (), Rhagae, and Arsacia, Ray is the oldest existing city in Tehran Province. In the classical era, it was a prominent city belonging to Media, the political and cultural base of the Medes. Ancient Persian inscriptions and the Avesta (Zoroastrian scriptures), among other sources, attest to the importance of ancient Ray. Ray is mentioned several times in the Apocrypha. It is also shown on the fourth-century Peutinger Map. The city was subject to severe destruction during the medieval invasions by the Arabs, Turks, and Mongols. Its position as a capital city was revived during the reigns of the Buyid Daylamites and the Seljuk Turks. Ray is richer than many other ancient cities in the number of its historical monuments. The Neolithic site of Cheshme-Ali, the reconstructed Median-era Rey Castle, the Parthian-era Rashkan Castle, the Sasanian-era Zoroastrian Fire Temple of Bahram, and the once Zoroastrian and now Islamic Shrine of Bibi Shahrbanu are among the many archaeological sites in Ray.

Ray has been home to many historical figures, including royalty, merchants, scholars and poets. The medieval Persian scholar Rhazes, one of the most important figures in medical science, was from Ray. One of the etymologies proposed for the name of the Radhanites—a group of merchants, some of Jewish origin, who kept open the Eurasian trade routes in the early Middle Ages—links them to Ray.

Ray today has many industries and factories in operation. It is connected via the rapid transit system of Tehran Metro to the rest of Greater Tehran.

== Geography ==
=== Mountain ranges === 
Ray County is located in the plain and its mountains are not very tall. These mountains are: 

1. Bibi Sharbanu (): The Bibi Sharbanu mountains are located in the east of Ray City, measuring 1535 meters above sea level. 

2. Arad mountains (): located in the center of Ray County, on the border between Kahrizak and Fashapoye parts, its height is 1428 meters. This range also appears in a map dated to 1307 AH, during the era of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, drawn by two Iranian engineers of the time. In the book &quot;Detailed Geography of Iran&quot;, Mount Arad is mentioned with the name of mountains &quot;Hasanabad&quot; and &quot;Kanargard&quot; (). 

3. Mar_e (mære): located in the southwest of Ray City and in the south of the cities of Hassanabad and Rudshur. Its height is 1503 meters. 

4. Kūh-e Qarah Bologh (): This mountain is located at the intersection of four cities, Zarandiyeh, Saveh, Ray and Qom.
===Rivers===

1. Karaj River: The Karaj River originates from Mount Alborz and flows into the Salt Lake after passing through several cities in Tehran Province. This river runs in a northwest-southeast direction throughout Ray City and after joining one of the branches of Jajroud flows into the salt lake. It is the second largest river after Zayandarud in the central plateau region. 

2. Jajrud river: Jajroud river is one of the permanent and important rivers of Tehran province, which flows along the southern direction and finally into the salt lake. A branch of this river passes through the eastern border of Ray City.

3. Shur Fashapoye River: The Shore River originates from Zanjan province and after passing through Qazvin province, the southwest of Tehran province and Zarandieh city, it reaches Ray City. This river crosses the width of Ray city in a northwest-southeast direction. The river is permanent and is 420 kilometers long.

===Vegetation=== 

The climate of the city is semi-arid and therefore does not have a natural forest, But it has a hand-planted forest of 387 hectares. However, in terms of pasture, it is relatively rich and has 166,200 hectares of pasture.

==Name==

&quot;Shahr-e Rey&quot; (, ) is Persian for &quot;City of Ray&quot;. &quot;Ray&quot; or () derives from Old Persian (), related to Persian (red). It is recorded in Ancient Greek as () and () and in Latin as and . It was once renamed () under the Seleucid Empire.

The name is spelled in various forms, including &quot;Ray&quot;, &quot;Rey&quot;, &quot;Rayy&quot; and &quot;Rhay&quot;. &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot; uses &quot;Ray&quot;.

In the past, the people of Ray were called &quot;Razi&quot;.

==History==
Agricultural settlements were long established as part of the Central Plateau Culture on local foothills such as that of Cheshme-Ali in northern Ray, which dates back to around 6,000 BC. The establishment of Ray has been attributed to ancient mythological monarchs, and it is also believed that Ray was the seat of a dynasty of Zoroastrian leadership.

===Classical era===

The Achaemenid Behistun Inscription mentions Ray (, ; , ; , ) as a part of Media, which was the political and cultural base of the ancient Medes, one of the ancient Iranian peoples.

Ray was one of the main strongholds of the Seleucid Empire. During the Seleucid period, Alexander the Great&#x27;s general Seleucus I Nicator renamed the city as &quot;Europos&quot; (), honoring his home city in Macedonia. In , Ray was conquered by the Parthian king Mithridates I (). Following the Parthian conquest of Ray, the city was renamed Arsacia. The city remained an important site under the Parthians, as demonstrated by its many coin mints, under the name of (the Greek form of &quot;Ragā/Raγā&quot;). Ray was used as one of the shifting capitals of the Parthian Empire, according to Athenaeus. According to Isidore of Charax, under the Parthian and Seleucid eras, Ray was surrounded by the province of Rhagiana together with four other cities. Ray was amongst the bases used by the Parthians to thwart nomadic attacks and to occasionally invade the Central Asian steppe.

Under the Sasanian Empire, Ray () was located near the center of the empire. It was the base of the powerful House of Mehran and the House of Spandiyad, two of the Seven Great Houses of Iran during the Sasanian period.

===Middle Ages===

Siyavash, the son of Mehran and the last King of Ray in the Sasanian Empire, was defeated fighting the Muslim invasion in 643. Ray was then used as a camp site under Arab Muslim military occupation. By the time of the Abbasid Caliphate, Ray was considerably restored and expanded into a new city named Mohammadiya. During the early Islamic period, the language spoken in Ray was the Razi dialect, which was most likely a continuation of the Median language.

The Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine, a shrine containing the tomb of Abd al-Aziz al-Hasani, a fifth generation descendant of Hasan ibn Ali and a companion of Muhammad al-Taqi, was built in the ninth century. It remains as the main Islamic sanctuary of the city to date.

A Tower of Silence, where Zoroastrians of after the Muslim conquest had come to put the bodies of the dead in the open, was built by a wealthy inhabitant of Ray on a hill in the tenth century. The tower, today in ruins and designated as &quot;Gabri&quot; (a term denoting &quot;Zoroastrian&quot;, adopted after the Muslim conquest), was reportedly soon taken by the Muslims.
Also dating to the tenth century is the Bibi Shahrbanu Shrine, which is the site of a former Zoroastrian temple dedicated to Anahita, the ancient Iranian goddess of the waters. The temple has been converted into a Muslim shrine claimed to be the burial of Shahrbanu, a legendary Sasanian princess who was captured by the Muslims and married Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad. It is likely that the name &quot;shahrbanu&quot;, meaning &quot;lady of the land&quot;, is in fact an attribution to Anahita, who bore the title &quot;banu&quot; (&quot;lady&quot;).

Ray was one of the capital cities of the Buyid dynasty. It was one of the cities that were equipped with rapid postal service, which was predominantly used for transferring official mails. The Buyid period came to an end in 1029, when the city was sacked brutally by Mahmud of Ghazni. A zealous Sunni, Mahmud had large numbers of the local population, consisting of Ismailis and Mazdakites, crucified and many books of the great library of Rayy burned as he considered them heretical.
Ray became later a capital city of the Seljuk Empire in the 11th century. During this time, the city of Ray was at its greatest expanse. It had developed a great urban market that also benefited its neighboring regions, including the once small town of Tehran, and had become a remarkable center for silk weaving. Commercial goods imported by traders via the Silk Road were brought into the bazaar of Ray. One of the monuments that survives from this period is the 12th-century Tughrul Tower, a brick tower built in 1140 that is attributed to Tughrul I, the founder of the Seljuk Empire.

Ray was home to a Shia Muslim community and some of the earliest Shia madrasas in Iran already in the 12th century, at least one established by Shia scholar Qazvini Razi, prior to the later Safavid official adoption of Shiism as the state religion.

In the early 13th century, following the Mongol invasion of Iran, Ray was severely destructed. It was abandoned and eventually lost its importance in the presence of the nearby growing town of Tehran. Ray remained abandoned throughout the time of the Timurid Empire.

===Early modern times===

Amin Razi, a Persian geographer from Ray who lived by the time of the Safavid dynasty, attests to the &quot;incomparable abundance&quot; of the gardens and canals of his hometown. In 1618, Italian author Pietro Della Valle described Ray as a large city with large gardens that was administered by a provincial governor but was not urbanized and did not seem to be inhabited.

The shrines of Shah Abdol-Azim and Bibi Shahrbanu, among other religious shrines throughout Iran, were notably reconstructed during the early modern period, using architectural techniques that were developed since the time of the Safavid dynasty to the time of the Qajar dynasty.

There is a relief located at Cheshme-Ali from the time of Fath-Ali Shah of the Qajar dynasty, who often used to explore the city, which shows the Qajar ruler in a hunting scene, replacing a former Sasanian relief that depicted an ancient Persian emperor in the same manner. It was engraved in 1831, and its surrounding was decorated with tablets covered with poetry.

===Contemporary era===

In the middle of the 19th century, Ray was described as a place of ruins, the only settlement being around the Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine. Being the only important pilgrimage site in vicinity to the royal court in the new capital Tehran brought more people to visit the shrine and a major restoration was sponsored by the court. Thus, between the years 1886 and 1888, under the reign of Qajar ruler Naser al-Din Shah, Ray became the first place in Iran to be connected to the capital by a railway. The railway had a short single line and transported a few steam locomotives that were colloquially called (&quot;smoky machine&quot;), between terminals that were called (from French ).

Excavations in the old city began in the late 19th century, and many of the findings were traded. Between 1933 and 1936, the Cheshme-Ali hill was excavated by archaeologists from the Boston Fine Arts Museum and the University Museum at the University of Pennsylvania headed by Erich Schmidt, which resulted in the discovery of a number of 7,000-year-old artifacts. Some of the discovered objects are displayed at museums in Iran, Chicago, and Philadelphia. Due to real estate expansions in the 1980s and 1990s, the hill is now mostly leveled out. Further excavations began in 1997, in a collaboration between the Iranian Ministry of Cultural Heritage, the Department of Archaeological Sciences of the University of Bradford and the Department of Archaeology of the University of Tehran.
In 1951, Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty, the second last shah of the Imperial State of Iran, was buried by the order of his son and successor Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in a mausoleum dedicated to him in Ray. The mausoleum was built near the Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine. Following the 1979 Revolution, the Mausoleum of Reza Shah was destroyed under the direction of Sadegh Khalkhali, an infamous cleric who was appointed by Ruhollah Khomeini as the head of the newly established Revolutionary Courts.

<doc id="202711" wikidata="Q1724002" url="?curid=202711" title="Vaganova method">
<text>The Vaganova method is a ballet technique and training system devised by the Russian dancer and pedagogue Agrippina Vaganova (1879–1951). It was derived from the teachings of the &quot;Premier Maître de Ballet&quot; Marius Petipa, throughout the late 19th century. It was Agrippa Vaganova who perfected and cultivated this form of teaching classical ballet and turned it into a viable syllabus. The method fuses elements of traditional French style from the romantic era with the athleticism and virtuosity of Italian Cecchetti technique. The training system is designed to involve the whole body in every movement, with equal attention paid to the upper body, legs and feet. Vaganova believed that this approach increases consciousness of the body, thus creating a harmony of movement and greater expressive range.

==History==
Upon graduating from the Imperial Ballet School in Saint Petersburg in 1897, Agrippina Vaganova began dancing with the school&#x27;s associated professional company, the Imperial Russian Ballet. She retired from dancing in 1916 to pursue a teaching career and in 1921 returned as a teacher at the school, which had been renamed the Leningrad Choreographic School.

During the 30 years she spent teaching at the Leningrad Choreographic School, Vaganova developed a ballet technique that combined elements of French, Italian, and earlier Russian technique, and a training method to teach the technique. Tenets of the training method included development of lower back strength and arm plasticity, and the strength, flexibility and endurance required for ballet, and it incorporated a detailed instruction process that specified when to teach each topic and how long to teach it. In 1934, Vaganova wrote &quot;Fundamentals of the Classical Dance&quot;, which remains a standard textbook for the instruction of ballet technique. In 1948, Vaganova authored a book titled &quot;The Foundation For Dance&quot; (more commonly known as &quot;Basic Principles of Russian Classical Dance&quot;) that outlined her training method and ballet technique. Following Vaganova&#x27;s death in 1951, her teaching method was preserved by instructors such as Vera Volkova, and Vera Kostrovitskaya.

Today the Vaganova method is the most widely used ballet teaching method in Russia, but is not limited to that country. It has been the predominant method in many other countries, such as Ukraine, Germany, and China. The State Ballet School of Berlin is the most well-known school using the Vaganova method outside Russia. There is a growing trend among American ballet schools to adopt the Vaganova method.

==Criticism==
One criticism is that it overemphasizes perfection of physical conditioning.

<doc id="202713" wikidata="Q5111691" url="?curid=202713" title="Standardized moment">
<text>In probability theory and statistics, a standardized moment of a probability distribution is a moment (often a higher degree central moment) that is normalized, typically by a power of the standard deviation, rendering the moment scale invariant. The shape of different probability distributions can be compared using standardized moments.

== Standard normalization ==
Let &quot;X&quot; be a random variable with a probability distribution &quot;P&quot; and mean value formula_1 (i.e. the first raw moment or moment about zero), the operator E denoting the expected value of &quot;X&quot;. Then the standardized moment of degree &quot;k&quot; is formula_2 that is, the ratio of the &quot;k&quot;th moment about the mean

:formula_3

to the &quot;k&quot;th power of the standard deviation,

:formula_4

The power of &quot;k&quot; is because moments scale as formula_5 meaning that formula_6 they are homogeneous functions of degree &quot;k&quot;, thus the standardized moment is scale invariant. This can also be understood as being because moments have dimension; in the above ratio defining standardized moments, the dimensions cancel, so they are dimensionless numbers.

The first four standardized moments can be written as:

For skewness and kurtosis, alternative definitions exist, which are based on the third and fourth cumulant respectively.

== Other normalizations ==

Another scale invariant, dimensionless measure for characteristics of a distribution is the coefficient of variation, formula_7. However, this is not a standardized moment, firstly because it is a reciprocal, and secondly because formula_8 is the first moment about zero (the mean), not the first moment about the mean (which is zero).

See Normalization (statistics) for further normalizing ratios.
