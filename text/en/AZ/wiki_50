<text>Banbury is an historic market town and civil parish on the River Cherwell in Oxfordshire, South East England. The parish had a population of 54,335 at the 2021 Census.

Banbury is a significant commercial and retail centre for the surrounding area of north Oxfordshire and southern parts of Warwickshire and Northamptonshire which are predominantly rural. Banbury&#x27;s main industries are motorsport, car components, electrical goods, plastics, food processing and printing. Banbury is home to the world&#x27;s largest coffee-processing facility (Jacobs Douwe Egberts), built in 1964. The town is famed for Banbury cakes, a spiced sweet pastry.

Banbury is located north-west of London, south-east of Birmingham, south-east of Coventry and north-west of Oxford.

==Toponymy==
The name Banbury may derive from &quot;Banna&quot;, a Saxon chieftain said to have built a stockade there in the 6th century (or possibly a byname from meaning &quot;felon&quot;, &quot;murderer&quot;), and / meaning &quot;settlement&quot;. In Anglo Saxon it was called (dative ). The name appears as &quot;Banesberie&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. Another known spelling was &quot;Banesebury&quot; in medieval times.

==History==


Archaeological evidence has been found for a British Iron Age settlement with circular buildings, dating back to 200 BC, in the Hennef Way area. Later there was a Roman villa at Wykham Park.

The area was settled by the Saxons around the late 5th century. In about 556 Banbury was the scene of a battle between the local Anglo-Saxons of Cynric and Ceawlin, and the local Romano-British. It was a local centre for Anglo-Saxon settlement by the mid-6th century. Banbury developed in the Anglo-Saxon period under Danish influence, starting in the late 6th century. It was assessed at 50 hides in the Domesday survey and was then held by the Bishop of Lincoln.

The Saxons built Banbury on the west bank of the River Cherwell. On the opposite bank they built Grimsbury, which was formerly part of Northamptonshire. Another district, Neithrop, is one of the oldest areas in Banbury, having first been recorded as a hamlet in the 13th century.

Banbury stands at the junction of two ancient roads: Salt Way (used as a bridle path to the west and south of the town), its primary use being transport of salt; and Banbury Lane, which began near Northampton and is closely followed by the modern road. It continued through what is now Banbury&#x27;s High Street and towards the Fosse Way at Stow-on-the-Wold. Banbury&#x27;s medieval prosperity was based on wool.

Banbury Castle was built from 1135 by Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, and survived into the Civil War in the 1640s, when it was besieged.

During the Civil War, due to its proximity to Oxford, the King&#x27;s capital, Banbury was at one stage a Royalist town, but the inhabitants were known to be strongly Puritan. The town later became pro-Parliamentarian, but the castle was manned by a Royalist garrison who supported King Charles I. The Reindeer Inn (now &#x27;Ye Olde Reine Deer Inn&#x27;) was reputedly used as a base by Oliver Cromwell, particularly in preparing for the Battle of Edge Hill in 1642. In 1645, Parliamentary troops were billeted in nearby Hanwell for nine weeks and villagers petitioned the Warwickshire Committee of Accounts to pay for feeding them. The castle was demolished after the war.

The opening of the Oxford Canal from Hawkesbury Junction to Banbury on 30 March 1778 gave the town a cheap and reliable supply of Warwickshire coal. In 1787 the Oxford Canal was extended southwards, finally opening to Oxford on 1 January 1790. The canal&#x27;s main boat yard was the original outlay of today&#x27;s Tooley&#x27;s Boatyard. The railway reached Banbury in 1850; Merton Street station on the Buckinghamshire Railway to Bletchley opened in May 1850, followed by Bridge Street station, later renamed Banbury General, on the Great Western Railway in September 1850.

People&#x27;s Park was set up as a private park in 1890 and opened in 1910, along with the adjacent bowling green.

The land south of the New Foscote Hospital in Calthorpe and Easington Farm were mostly open farmland until the early 1960s. The Ruscote estate, which now has a notable South Asian community, was expanded in the 1950s because of the growth of the town due to the London overspill and further grew in the mid-1960s.

British Railways closed Merton Street railway station and the Buckingham to Banbury line to passenger traffic at the end of 1960. Merton Street goods depot continued to handle livestock traffic for Banbury&#x27;s cattle market until 1966, when this too was discontinued and the railway dismantled. In March 1962 Sir John Betjeman celebrated the line from Culworth Junction in his poem &quot;Great Central Railway, Sheffield Victoria to Banbury&quot;. British Railways closed this line too in 1966.

The main railway station, previously called Banbury General but now called simply Banbury, is now served by trains running from London Paddington via and once daily, from London Marylebone via and Bicester onwards to Birmingham and and by CrossCountry Trains from and Reading to Birmingham, Manchester and .

Banbury used to have a large cattle market. Situated on Merton Street in Grimsbury, for many decades, cattle and other farm animals were driven there on the hoof from as far as Scotland to be sold to feed the growing population of London and other towns. Since its closure in June 1998, a new housing development and Dashwood Primary School has been built on its site. The estate, which lies between Banbury and Hanwell, was built on the grounds of Hanwell Farm during 2005 and 2006.

===Banburyshire===
The name &#x27;Banburyshire&#x27; is sometimes used informally to describe the area centred on Banbury, claimed to include parts of Northamptonshire and Warwickshire as well as north Oxfordshire. Use of the term dates from the early to mid 19th century. It was common in the 19th century for market towns in England to describe their hinterland by tacking &quot;shire&quot; onto the town&#x27;s name. &quot;Stones Map of Banburyshire&quot; held by the Centre of Banbury Studies was published in the 1870s or 1880s and it asserted that the term originated in the 1830s but no source is given for that assertion. In the 1850s magazine articles used &quot;Banburyshire&quot; or the hyphenated term &quot;Banbury-shire&quot;. The Banburyshire Natural History Society was formed in 1881.
In the 20th century a number of books used the term &quot;Banburyshire&quot; in their titles, dating from the early 1960s.

The county of Oxfordshire has two main commercial centres, the city of Oxford itself that serves most of the south of the county, and Banbury that serves the north (such as Adderbury, Cropredy, Deddington, Wroxton, Great Bourton, and Bloxham) plus parts of the neighbouring counties of Northamptonshire and Warwickshire.

==Governance==
There are three tiers of local government covering Banbury, at civil parish (town), district, and county level: Banbury Town Council, Cherwell District Council, and Oxfordshire County Council. The town council is based at Banbury Town Hall on Bridge Street.

===Administrative history===

Banbury was an ancient parish. The parish historically straddled the boundary between Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire, which followed the River Cherwell. The Oxfordshire part of the parish (west of the river) included the town itself and the hamlets of Neithrop, Calthorpe, Easington, Hardwick, and Wykham. The Northamptonshire part of the parish (east of the river) included the hamlets of Grimsbury and Nethercote.

In 1554, Mary I issued a charter which incorporated the town as a borough. Prior to that, it had been a lower status seigneurial borough, controlled by the Bishop of Lincoln as lord of the manor. Mary&#x27;s charter defined a borough boundary matching the parish, but the borough later came to be defined as a much smaller area, just covering the urban area as it then was.

From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Banbury, the civil functions were exercised by subdivisions of the parish rather than the parish as a whole. In Banbury&#x27;s case, the parish was split into three parts for administering the poor laws: the area of the borough, the remainder of the Oxfordshire part of the parish (known as the township of Neithrop), and the Northamptonshire part of the parish. The latter part was jointly administered with the neighbouring parish of Warkworth. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so the old ecclesiastical parish of Banbury (which retained its church functions) diverged from the civil parishes of Banbury (just covering the borough), Neithrop and Warkworth.

The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. The borough&#x27;s powers were primarily judicial rather than providing public services for the growing town. In order to provide services and infrastructure, the whole ecclesiastical parish of Banbury was made a local board district in 1852, with the local board being responsible for sewers, public health, and other aspects of local government. The borough corporation and the local board then existed alongside each other, with their differently defined areas and roles, until 1889.
In 1889, following the Local Government Act 1888, the Northamptonshire parts of the local board district (Grimsbury and Nethercote) were transferred to Oxfordshire, and the local board&#x27;s functions were transferred to the borough corporation, with the borough being enlarged to cover the whole of the old local board district. The borough council met at Banbury Town Hall until 1930, when it moved its offices and meetings to the former Municipal Technical School (built 1893) on Marlborough Road.

The municipal borough of Banbury was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, with its area becoming part of the new Cherwell district.

No successor parish was created for Banbury at the time of the 1974 reforms and so it became unparished; instead, the Cherwell councillors who represented wards in Banbury acted as charter trustees to preserve the town&#x27;s civic traditions, including appointing one of them to take the title of mayor each year. A number of roads are named after former mayors, including Mascord Road, Mold Crescent and Fairfax Close. A new civil parish of Banbury was created in 2000, with its parish council taking the name Banbury Town Council. Since then, the chair of the town council has taken the title of mayor.

==Geography==

Banbury is in the Cherwell Valley with many hills in and around the town. Apart from the town centre, much of Banbury is on a slope and each entry into the town is downhill. Estates such as Bretch Hill and Hardwick are built on top of a hill and much of the town can be seen from both. Other notable hills include the suburban, Crouch Hill and the more central Pinn Hill, and Strawberry Hill on the outskirts of Easington. Mine Hill and Rye Hill lie, along with many others, to the northeast, southeast and west of Banbury.

Banbury is located at the bank of the River Cherwell which sweeps through the town, going just east of the town centre with Grimsbury being the only estate east of the river. Banbury is at the northern extreme of the UK&#x27;s South East England region, less than from the boundary with the East Midlands, and from that with the West Midlands. As such it has close cultural links with neighbouring Midlands towns such as Stratford-upon-Avon, Leamington Spa, and Warwick.

In 1998 and 2007, Banbury was subject to heavy flooding due to its location by the River Cherwell. Heavy clay and Ironstone deposits surround Banbury.
==Industry and commerce==

The Domesday Book in 1086 listed three mills, with a total fiscal value of 45 shillings, on the Bishop of Lincoln&#x27;s demesne lands, and a fourth which was leased to Robert son of Waukelin by the Bishop. Among Banbury&#x27;s four Medieval mills was probably a forerunner of Banbury Mill, first referred to by this name in 1695. In 1279, Laurence of Hardwick was also paying 3 marks (equivalent to 40 shillings) in annual rent to the Bishop for a mill in the then Hardwick hamlet. The forerunners of Butchers Row were probably long standing butchers&#x27; stalls which were known to be in situ by 1438. The old Victorian Corn Exchange is now used as an entrance to a shopping centre.

The Northern Aluminium Co. Ltd. or Alcan Industries Ltd. pig and rolled aluminium factory was opened in 1931 on land acquired in 1929 on the east of the Southam road, in the then hamlet of Hardwick. The various Alcan facilities on the 53-acre site closed between 2006 and 2007. The factory was demolished between 2008 and 2009. The laboratory was also closed in 2004 and is now used as offices for numerous companies. Another major employer is Jacobs Douwe Egberts, which produces instant coffee. The facility moved to Banbury from Birmingham in 1965.

In the central area were built many large shops, a bus station, and a large car park north of Castle Street. In 1969 proposals for the redevelopment of the central area were in hand, leading to the creation of the Castle shopping centre in 1977 (the centre was later combined into the Castle Quay centre). The 1977 plans to build a multi-storey car park on what is now the open air car park behind Matalan and Poundland were scrapped in 1978 and another one was built to the rear of the Castle Shopping Centre in 1978.

The former Hunt Edmunds brewery premises became Crest Hotels headquarters, but closed in the late 1970s and was abandoned in the late 1980s, while the Crown Hotel and the Foremost Tyres/Excel Exhausts shops found new owners after they closed in 1976 due to falling sales. Hella, a vehicle electronics firm, closed its factory on the Southam Road in the mid-2000s. The ironmonger, Hoods, opened in the mid-1960s and closed in 2007, with the shop becoming part of the then enlarged Marks and Spencer.

===Motorsport===
Owing to the surrounding area&#x27;s notable links with world motorsport, the town is home to many well known organisations within the industry. Prodrive, one of the world&#x27;s largest motorsport and automotive technology specialists, is based in the town as are a host of race teams involved in competition across many different disciplines and countries.

Within Formula One, two teams have had their base of operations in Banbury. The Simtek team which competed in the 1994 and 1995 F1 World Championships was based on the Wildmere Industrial Estate. The Marussia F1 team had its manufacturing and production facility sited on Thorpe Way Industrial Estate using the building formerly owned by Ascari Cars, a luxury sports car manufacturer. Both Simtek and Marussia F1 had been brought to Banbury by Nick Wirth who owned the Simtek team and was the former Technical Director at Marussia. After Marussia F1 went into administration in 2014, their base was purchased by the United States–based Haas F1 Team to service their cars during the European races.

Until 2017, when the team went into administration and subsequently folded, Manor Racing (the successor to Marussia) was based in the town.

Arden Motorsport, a British multi-formula motorsports team (founded by Red Bull Racing boss Christian Horner), is also based in the town.

===Employment===
Banbury has one of the UK&#x27;s lowest unemployment rates, as of April 2016 it stood at 0.7%. Once Poland joined the European Union in 2004, a number of Banbury-based employment agencies began advertising for staff in major Polish newspapers. In 2006 one estimate placed between 5,000 and 6,000 Poles in the town. With the influx of the largely Roman Catholic Poles, one local church was offering a Mass said partially in Polish and specialist Polish food shops had opened.

===Companies and charities===
Jacobs Douwe Egberts, in the Ruscote ward of Banbury, is a large food and coffee producing factory. 
It was built in 1964 and has gone through a number of ownership changes since. It is still sometimes known by its previous names of Bird&#x27;s, Kraft and General Foods or GF.

===Cattle market===
Banbury was once home to Western Europe&#x27;s largest cattle market, on Merton Street in Grimsbury. The market was a key feature of Victorian life in the town and county. It was formally closed in June 1998, after being abandoned several years earlier and was replaced with a new housing development and Dashwood Primary School.

===Buses and coaches===
The town&#x27;s bus routes are operated primarily by Stagecoach in Oxfordshire both within the town and linking it with Brackley, Chipping Norton, Oxford and places further afield including Daventry, Leamington Spa and Stratford-upon-Avon.

===Roads===
Hennef Way (A422) was upgraded to a dual carriageway, easing traffic on the heavily congested road and providing north Banbury and the town centre with higher-capacity links to the M40 motorway.

===Canal===
The Oxford Canal is a popular place for pleasure trips and tourism. The canal&#x27;s main boatyard is now the listed site Tooley&#x27;s Boatyard.

==Media==
The &quot;Banbury Guardian&quot; is published weekly on Thursdays by Johnston Press, is priced for sale and is a tabloid. The &quot;Banbury Cake&quot; was formerly a free newspaper: its print edition ceased publication in 2017 and its website subsequently also closed.

Regional TV news is provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals received from the Oxford TV transmitter, although some parts of the town get a better TV signal from the local relay transmitter which is served by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Oxford, Heart South, and Capital Mid-Counties. Banbury Music Radio was a local Internet radio station.

==Places of interest==

===Banbury Cross===

At one time Banbury had many crosses (the High Cross, the Bread Cross and the White Cross), but these were destroyed by Puritans in 1600. Banbury remained without a cross for more than 250 years until the current Banbury Cross was erected in 1859 at the centre of the town to commemorate the marriage of Victoria, Princess Royal (eldest child of Queen Victoria) to Prince Frederick of Prussia. The current Banbury Cross is a stone, spire-shaped monument decorated in Gothic form. Statues of Queen Victoria, Edward VII and George V were added in 1914 to commemorate the coronation of George V. The cross is high, and topped by a gilt cross. Towns with crosses in England before the reformation were places of Christian pilgrimage.

The English nursery rhyme &quot;Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross&quot;, in its several forms, may refer to one of the crosses destroyed by Puritans in 1600. In April 2005, Princess Anne unveiled a large bronze statue depicting the Fine Lady upon a White Horse of the nursery rhyme. It stands on the corner of West Bar and South Bar, just yards from the present Banbury Cross.

===Banbury Museum &amp; Gallery===

Banbury has a museum in the town centre near Spiceball Park, replacing the old museum near Banbury Cross. It is accessible over a bridge from the Castle Quay Shopping Centre or &quot;via&quot; Spiceball Park Road. Admission to the museum is free. The town&#x27;s tourist information centre is located in the museum entrance in the Castle Quay Shopping Centre.

===Tooley&#x27;s Boatyard===
Tooley&#x27;s Boatyard was built in 1778 and is a historic site with a nearly 250-year-old blacksmiths&#x27; shop and narrow boat dry dock.

===Spiceball Centre and Park===
Spiceball Park is the largest park in Banbury. It is east of the Oxford Canal, mainly west of the River Cherwell, north of Castle Quay and south of Hennef Way. It includes three large fields, a children&#x27;s play area and a skateboard park. Across the road from the main park there is the sports centre, which includes a swimming pool, courts, café and gym facilities. The sports centre began to be re-developed in late 2009, for a new centre and café, which was completed by mid 2010.

===Other recreational areas and parks===
Neithrop is home to the People&#x27;s Park which opened in 1910, and has a bird house, tennis courts, a large field and a children&#x27;s play area. The park is often used in the summer to hold small festivals. The park is also one of the town&#x27;s biggest in terms of the area covered and one of the few major ones not to be built on a steep hill. Easington Recreation Ground is another principal park and recreational area.

===Notable place names===
*Since 1999 bridge 164 on the Oxford Canal in Banbury has borne Tom Rolt&#x27;s name in commemoration of his book &quot;Narrow Boat&quot; (as does the Tom Rolt Centre at the Ellesmere Port section of the National Waterways Museum). A blue plaque commemorating Rolt was unveiled at Tooley&#x27;s Boatyard, Banbury on 7 August 2010 as part of the centenary celebrations of his birth.
*Concorde Avenue was named in a 1995 street naming contest in honour of the 50 years&#x27; peace (1945–1995) in Europe since the Second World War.
*Claypits Close was built in about 2007 and named after the old clay pit on which it was built. There were many small, Victorian clay pits and kilns in the south west of Banbury, but they had closed by the 1920s.
*Gillett Road was named after either Joseph Ashby Gillett, who ran Banbury&#x27;s branch of 18th century Britain&#x27;s &quot;New Bank&quot;, or his descendant Sarah Beatrice Gillett, who was mayor in 1926.

==Education==
One of the campuses of Activate Learning, Banbury and Bicester College, as well as one of the international campuses of Fairleigh Dickinson University at Wroxton Abbey are situated in Banbury. The town also has four secondary schools – North Oxfordshire Academy, Wykham Park Academy, Space Studio Banbury and Blessed George Napier Roman Catholic School – and a number of primary schools. Independent schools in Banbury include Tudor Hall and Al-Madina School.

==Religion==

In 1377 a pardon was given to a Welshman, who was wanted for killing another Welshman, after the accused person had taken sanctuary in St Mary&#x27;s parish church. The Neithrop district of Banbury was the scene of rioting in 1589 after Neithrop&#x27;s maypole was destroyed by Puritans.

Reverend William Whateley (1583–1639), whose father was several times bailiff or mayor of Banbury, was a notable Banbury vicar, who was instituted in 1610 but had already been a &#x27;lecturer&#x27; there for some years. In 1626 Whateley refused communion to his own brother, who had been presented for religious incompetence. A report by the church wardens in 1619 said he was a well liked and tolerant priest. The Quaker meeting house by the town centre lane called &#x27;The Leys&#x27; was built between 1748 and 1750. In 1838, the Catholic St John the Evangelist Church was built, parts of it were designed by Augustus Pugin and it is a Grade II listed building.

In 1968, St. Joseph the Worker Catholic Church was built on Edmunds Road which was at first a mass centre for St. John&#x27;s.

Banbury has several sporting clubs, most notably Banbury United football club. There are also rugby (Banbury RUFC), canoeing, golf, running, triathlon and cricket clubs. These clubs represent a variety of age groups, and play at varying levels, from amateur to national. Banbury United F.C. was first formed as Spencer Villa in 1931 and their home matches played at Middleton Road. At this time it was essentially a works club. In 1934, they changed their name to Banbury Spencer and moved to the Spencer Stadium.

Banbury and District Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1904. The club disappeared in the mid-1920s. A greyhound racing track was opened during the summer of 1951, north of Banbury town centre on the east side of Southam Road. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The racing lasted until the latter part of 1954.

==Twinning==
Banbury is twinned with:
* Ermont in France, since 1982.
* Hennef in Germany, since 1981.

Twinning in Banbury began on 26 October 1978, at a public meeting held at the Post-Graduate Education Centre, and called on the initiative of the late Councillor Ron Smith, the then Town Mayor of Banbury. Initial visits between Banbury and Ermont in 1979, and for a long time after there was a period of informal relationship before a formal agreement was signed in 1982. Contact was first made with Hennef about a possible agreement in October 1980 and within a year the formal agreement was signed. As a consequence of this, two roads in Banbury (Hennef Way and Ermont Way) have been named after the two towns. Likewise a former Railway station square in Hennef has been named Banburyplatz.

<text>In heraldry, Saint George&#x27;s Cross (or the Cross of Saint George) is a red cross on a white background, which from the Late Middle Ages became associated with Saint George, the military saint, often depicted as a crusader.

Associated with the crusades, the red-on-white cross has its origins in the 10th century. It has been used as the ensign of the Republic of Genoa from perhaps as early as the 10th century. 

The symbol was adopted by the Swabian League in the pre-Reformation Holy Roman Empire. George became associated as patron saint of England in the fourteenth century, replacing St Edmund the Martyr. Since then this flag is commonly identified as the national flag of England. Saint George is the patron saint of Catalonia and of the country of Georgia. It figures in the coat of arms of Barcelona. The national flag of Georgia supplements this cross with Jerusalem crosses.

Across the rest of Northern Italy as the symbol of Bologna, Genoa, Padua, Reggio Emilia, Mantua, Vercelli and Alessandria, the form has only received a cult of Saint George bolstering and simplification to the cross of Saint Ambrose, the origin of the cross in their civic designs, as the latter was adopted by the Commune of Milan in 1045, Ambrose having been a late 4th-century bishop of that city.

==Origins and medieval use==


Saint George became widely venerated as a warrior saint during the Third Crusade. There was a legend that he had miraculously assisted Godfrey of Bouillon; also that Richard the Lionheart had placed himself under his protection.
According to legend, the crusaders received miraculous help at the siege of Antioch on 28 June 1098 from a great army on white horses, clothed in white and bearing white banners, led by St George, St Demetrius, and St Mercurius. However, there was no association of the red cross with St George before the end of the crusades.

The &quot;red&quot; cross in particular was associated with the Knights Templar, from the time of the Second Crusade (1145),
but in 1188 red and white crosses were chosen to identify the French and English troops in the &quot;Kings&#x27; Crusade&quot; of Philip II of France and Henry II of England, respectively. 
Together with the Jerusalem Cross, the plain red-on-white became a recognizable symbol of the crusader from about 1190, and in the 13th century it came to be used as a standard or emblem by numerous leaders or polities who wanted to associate themselves with the crusades. 
The red-on-white combination was chosen by the Kingdom of Aragon, among others. 

Saint George was depicted as a crusader knight during this time, but the red cross had no particular association with him. A crusader-era fresco in the crypt of Trani cathedral shows Saint George wearing a white cross on a red surcoat. The white-on-red version was chosen as the (&quot;imperial banner&quot;) by the German crusaders in the 12th century, and Emperor Frederick II used it in his European campaigns of the 1250s after he had returned from the crusades. It continued to be used as the (&quot;imperial war flag&quot;) of the Holy Roman Empire, eventually giving rise to the flag of Savoy and the present-day flags of Switzerland and Denmark. Via the conflict between (pro-Pope) Guelphs and (pro-Imperial) Ghibellines, the cross entered the heraldry of several north Italian principalities.

A is mentioned in the Genovese annals for the year 1198, referring to a red flag with a depiction of St George and the dragon. An illumination of this flag is shown in the annals for the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this &quot;George&#x27;s flag&quot;, from at least 1218, and was known as the (&quot;cross ensign of the commune of Janua&quot;). The flag showing the saint himself was the city&#x27;s principal war flag, but the flag showing the plain cross was used alongside it in the 1240s.

The cross ceased to be a symbol directly associated with the &quot;taking of the cross&quot;, the resolve to fight in a crusade, after the failure of the crusades in the 14th century. With the development of systematic heraldry, there was great demand for variations of the cross symbol and associated terminology. Juliana Berners reports that there were &quot;Crossis innumerabull born dayli&quot;. The term &quot;St George&#x27;s cross&quot; was at first associated with any plain Greek cross touching the edges of the field (not necessarily red on white).

Early representations of Saint George as a crusader knight with bearing a red-on-white cross still date to the late 13th century, and become widespread as the saint&#x27;s attributed arms in the 14th and 15th centuries.
Edward III of England chose Saint George as the patron saint of his Order of the Garter in 1348, and also took to using a red-on-white cross in the hoist of his Royal Standard.

==England==


===Origin===
There was a historiographical tradition claiming that Richard the Lionheart himself adopted both the flag and the patron saint from Genoa at some point during his crusade. This idea can be traced to the Victorian era, Perrin (1922) refers to it as a &quot;common belief&quot;, and it is still popularly repeated today even though it cannot be substantiated as historical.

On the origins of the flag and its connection to the Genoese flag, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, said in a speech in Genoa in 1992:

The St. George&#x27;s flag, a red cross on a white field, was adopted by England and the City of London in 1190 for their ships entering the Mediterranean to benefit from the protection of the Genoese fleet. The English Monarch paid an annual tribute to the Doge of Genoa for this privilege.
The red cross was introduced to England by the late 13th century, but not as a flag, and not at the time associated with Saint George. It was worn by English soldiers as an identification from the early years of the reign of Edward I (1270s), and perhaps originated a few years earlier, in the Second Barons&#x27; War (specifically in the Battle of Evesham of 1265, during which, according to chronicler William Rishanger, Simon de Montfort observed that the king had taken from him the idea of having his soldiers marked with a cross).

Saint George rose to the position of &quot;patron saint of England&quot; in a process beginning in 1348 with the foundation of the Order of the Garter and culminating with the abolition of all saint&#x27;s banners except for the St George&#x27;s banner in 1552. From 1348 and throughout the 15th century, the Saint George&#x27;s Cross was shown in the hoist of the Royal Standards of the Plantagenet kings of England.

=== Flag ===

 

A combined British flag was created in 1606 (after the dynastic union of England and Scotland in 1603, the so-called &quot;Union of the Crowns&quot;) by combining Saint George&#x27;s Cross with the Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cross (the flag of Scotland). The flag was initially for maritime display, later restricted to the King&#x27;s ships. Afterwards, the Saint George flag remained the flag of England for other purposes until the Acts of Union 1707. At the union, the first Union Flag became official for all purposes in the new Kingdom of Great Britain.
From this time, the Saint George&#x27;s Cross came to be seen as a symbol of England and Wales when used alongside symbols for Scotland or Ireland; so in the flags of the Commonwealth of England during 1649 to 1660.

The flag of Saint George is also the rank flag of an Admiral in the Royal Navy, and civilian craft are forbidden to fly it. However, surviving little ships of Dunkirk, which participated in the Dunkirk evacuation during World War II, are allowed to fly it as a jack. This is normally done in the defaced form of the Dunkirk jack.

Churches belonging to the Church of England may fly the Saint George&#x27;s Cross (unless another flag is flown by custom for special reasons). The correct way for the church to fly the Saint George&#x27;s cross (since an order from the Earl Marshal in 1938) is with the arms of the diocese in the upper left-hand corner of the flag.

The flag of St George has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity since the late 20th century, partly due to football-inspired nationalism, and also in response to the devolution movements in Scotland and Wales.

During the 2010 World Cup, UK Prime Minister David Cameron told Parliament that the flag would fly above his official residence at &quot;no extra cost to the tax payer&quot; while England played in the contest.

===Derived usage===

Most of the derived usage is from the flag of England. That article has illustrations of its derivations particularly across Canada, eastern Australia, the Caribbean and the Channel Islands apart from Jersey since Guernsey commonly used the English flag from 1936 (then moved to its present variant in 1985), however the illustrations below have an extremely complex or nil derivation from that flag. 

The flag of the City of London use the St George&#x27;s Cross on a white background, with a red sword in the canton. The sword is believed to represent the sword that beheaded Saint Paul who is the patron saint of the city.

==Georgia==

Saint George is the patron saint of the nation of Georgia, and the Saint George flag was supposedly used in the 5th century by Georgian king Vakhtang Gorgasali. In the 13th century, Queen Tamar of Georgia used the Saint George flag during her campaign against Seljuk Turks. The four Jerusalem crosses were later added by King George V of Georgia, who drove out the Mongols from Georgia in 1334.

The flag fell out during the Russian annexation of Georgia and abolition of the Georgian monarchy. However, the flag was revived by the Georgian patriotic movement in the 1990s. A majority of Georgians supported the restoration of the medieval flag of Georgia, including the influential Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia Ilia II of the Georgian Orthodox Church. The flag was finally adopted by the Georgian parliament on 14 January 2004. It was formally endorsed by a presidential decree signed by Mikheil Saakashvili on 25 January, following his election as President of Georgia. The Georgian Navy&#x27;s naval ensign also used a St. George&#x27;s Cross during its existence.

*The flag of Barcelona combines the cross of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia, with the traditional red and yellow bars of the Senyera, the ancient symbol of the Crown of Aragon (here, the bars are vertical, though the modern flag of Catalonia has horizontal stripes).
*The flag of Almería, Spain, consist of a St George&#x27;s Cross.
*The crest of Royal St. George&#x27;s College in Toronto, Canada, contains a St George&#x27;s Cross.
*The Indian naval flag used to feature a St. George Cross until it was removed in 2022
*Both the flag of Sardinia and the flag of Corsica are derived from the Four Moors flag, also known as the &quot;Cross of Alcoraz&quot;. This consists of a red cross of Saint George on a white background with a &quot;maure&quot; (moor&#x27;s head) in each quarter. This is also found in the flag of Aragon, (Spain), and is based on a war flag of the Reconquista following the Battle of Alcoraz in 1096.
*The flag and arms of Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, consist of a St George&#x27;s Cross, as St George is one of the city&#x27;s patron saints.
*In Sweden, the term &quot;Saint George&#x27;s cross&quot; sometimes refers to the Cross pattée used by Swedish Freemasons. For example, the cross of the Swedish Order of Freemasons was defined by the King of Sweden in 1928 to be a &quot;red St George&#x27;s cross with triangular arms&quot;.
*In Finland, the Cross pattée is called &quot;Yrjön risti&quot;, &quot;George&#x27;s cross&quot;, while the red cross on a white background is called &quot;Pyhän Yrjön risti&quot;, &quot;Saint George&#x27;s cross&quot;.
* Some British Commonwealth countries used the St. George&#x27;s Cross on their naval ensigns, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, South Africa.
* The naval jack of Italy contains a St. George&#x27;s Cross on the second quarter.
* Naval flags of Latvia, contain a St. George&#x27;s Cross coloured in the same pattern as the Latvian national flag.

<doc id="205480" wikidata="Q561101" url="?curid=205480" title="Richard Price">
<text>Richard Price (23 February 1723 – 19 April 1791) was a British moral philosopher, Nonconformist minister and mathematician. He was also a political reformer and pamphleteer, active in radical, republican, and liberal causes such as the French and American Revolutions. He was well-connected and fostered communication between many people, including Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, George Washington, Mirabeau and the Marquis de Condorcet. According to the historian John Davies, Price was &quot;the greatest Welsh thinker of all time&quot;.

Born in Llangeinor, near Bridgend, Wales, Price spent most of his adult life as minister of Newington Green Unitarian Church, then on the outskirts of London. He edited, published and developed the Bayes–Price theorem and the field of actuarial science. He also wrote on issues of demography and finance, and was a Fellow of the Royal Society.

==Early life==

Born on 23 February 1723, Richard Price was the son of Rhys Price, a dissenting minister. His mother was Catherine Richards, his father&#x27;s second wife. Richard was born at Tyn Ton, a farmhouse in the village of Llangeinor, Glamorgan. He was educated privately, then at Neath and Pen-twyn. He studied under Vavasor Griffiths at Chancefield, Talgarth, Powys.

He then moved to London, where he spent the rest of his life. He studied with John Eames and the dissenting academy in Moorfields, London. Leaving the academy in 1744, Price became chaplain and companion to George Streatfield at Stoke Newington, then a village just north of London. He also held the lectureship at Old Jewry, where Samuel Chandler was minister. Streatfield&#x27;s death and that of an uncle in 1757 improved Price&#x27;s circumstances, and on 16 June 1757 he married Sarah Blundell, originally of Belgrave in Leicestershire.

==Newington Green congregation==
In 1758, Price moved to Newington Green, and took up residence in No. 54 the Green, in the middle of a terrace that was even then a hundred years old. (The building still survives as London&#x27;s oldest brick terrace, dated 1658.) Price became minister to the Newington Green meeting-house, a church that continues today as Newington Green Unitarian Church. Among the congregation were Samuel Vaughan and his family. Price had Thomas Amory as preaching colleague from 1770.

When, in 1770, Price became morning preacher at the Gravel Pit Chapel in Hackney, he continued his afternoon sermons at Newington Green. He also accepted duties at the meeting house in Old Jewry.

==Friends and associates==
===Newington Green neighbours===
A close friend of Price was Thomas Rogers, father of Samuel Rogers, a merchant turned banker who had married into a long-established Dissenting family and lived at No. 56 the Green. More than once, Price and the elder Rogers rode on horseback to Wales. Another was the Rev. James Burgh, author of &quot;The Dignity of Human Nature&quot; and &quot;Thoughts on Education&quot;, who opened his Dissenting Academy on the Green in 1750 and sent his pupils to Price&#x27;s sermons. Price, Rogers, and Burgh formed a dining club, eating at each other&#x27;s houses in rotation. Price and Rogers joined the Society for Constitutional Information.

===Bowood circle===

The &quot;Bowood circle&quot; was a group of liberal intellectuals around Lord Shelburne, and named after Bowood House, his seat in Wiltshire. Price met Shelburne in or shortly after 1767, or was introduced by his wife Elizabeth Montagu, a leader of the Blue Stocking intellectual women, after the publication of his &quot;Four Dissertations&quot; in that year.

In 1771, Price had Shelburne employ Thomas Jervis. Another member of the circle was Benjamin Vaughan. In 1772, Price recruited Joseph Priestley, who came to work for Shelburne as librarian from 1773.

===&quot;Club of Honest Whigs&quot;===
The group that Benjamin Franklin christened the &quot;Club of Honest Whigs&quot; was an informal dining group around John Canton. It met originally in St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard, at the London Coffee House; in 1771 it moved to Ludgate Hill. Price and Sir John Pringle were members, as were Priestley and Benjamin Vaughan.

===Visitors===
Price was visited by Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas Paine; other American politicians such as John Adams, who later became the second president of the United States, and his wife Abigail; and British politicians such as Lord Lyttleton, Lord Stanhope (known as &quot;Citizen Stanhope&quot;), and William Pitt the Elder. He knew also the philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith. Among activists, the prison reformer John Howard counted Price as a close friend; also there were John Horne Tooke, and John and Ann Jebb.

===Theologians===

Others acknowledged their debt to Price, such as the Unitarian theologians William Ellery Channing and Theophilus Lindsey. When Lindsey resigned his living and moved to London to create an avowedly Unitarian congregation Price played a role in finding and securing the premises for what became Essex Street Chapel. At the end of the 1770s Price and Lindsey were concerned about the contraction of dissent, at least in the London area. With Andrew Kippis and others, they established the Society for Promoting Knowledge of the Scriptures in 1783.

Price and Priestley took diverging views on morals and metaphysics. In 1778 appeared a published correspondence, &quot;A Free Discussion on the Doctrines of Materialism and Philosophical Necessity&quot;. Price maintained, in opposition to Priestley, the free agency of man and the unity and immateriality of the human soul. Price&#x27;s opinions were Arian, Priestley&#x27;s were Socinian.

===Mary Wollstonecraft===

Mary Wollstonecraft moved her fledgling school for girls from Islington to Newington Green in 1784, with patron Mrs Burgh, widow of Price&#x27;s friend James Burgh. Wollstonecraft, originally an Anglican, attended Price&#x27;s services, where believers of all kinds were welcomed. The Rational Dissenters appealed to Wollstonecraft: they were hard-working, humane, critical but uncynical, and respectful towards women, and proved kinder to her than her own family. Price is believed to have helped her with money to go to Lisbon, Spain, to see her close friend Fanny Blood.

Wollstonecraft was then unpublished: through Price she met the radical publisher Joseph Johnson. The ideas Wollstonecraft ingested from the sermons at Newington Green pushed her towards a political awakening. She later published &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Men&quot; (1790), a response to Burke&#x27;s denunciation of the French Revolution and attack on Price; and &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1792), extending Price&#x27;s arguments about equality to women: Tomalin argues that just as the Dissenters were &quot;excluded as a class from education and civil rights by a lazy-minded majority&quot;, so too were women, and the &quot;character defects of both groups&quot; could be attributed to this discrimination. Price appears 14 times in the diary of William Godwin, Wollstonecraft&#x27;s later husband.

==American Revolution==
The support Price gave to the colonies of British North America in the American War of Independence made him famous. In early 1776, he published the pamphlet &quot;Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty, the Principles of Government, and the Justice and Policy of the War with America&quot;. Sixty thousand copies of this pamphlet were sold within days; and a cheap edition was issued which sold twice as many copies. It commended Shelburne&#x27;s proposals for the colonies, and attacked the Declaratory Act. Additionally, he denounced the &quot;cruel, wicked and diabolical&quot; slave trade while highlighting the contradictions in Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Declaration of Independence, stating, “if there are any men whom they have a right to hold in slavery, there may be others who have a right to hold them in slavery.” Among its critics were Adam Ferguson, William Markham, John Wesley, and Edmund Burke; and Price rapidly became one of the best known men in England. He was presented with the freedom of the city of London, and it is said that his pamphlet had a part in determining the Americans to declare their independence. A second pamphlet, &quot;Additional observations on the nature and value of civil liberty, and the war with America&quot;, followed. Price was a consistent critic of war in general and the corrupting effects of growing government debt.

Price&#x27;s name became identified with the cause of American independence. Franklin was a close friend; Price corresponded with Turgot; and in the winter of 1778 Price was invited by the Continental Congress to go to America and assist in the financial administration of the states, an offer he turned down. In 1781 he, solely with George Washington, received the degree of Doctor of Laws from Yale College. He preached to crowded congregations, and, when Lord Shelburne became Prime Minister in 1782, he was offered the post of his private secretary. The same year he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1785, Price was elected an international member of the American Philosophical Society.

Price wrote also &quot;Observations on the importance of the American Revolution and the means of rendering it a benefit to the World&quot; (1784). Well received by Americans, it suggested that the greatest problem facing Congress was its lack of central powers.

==French Revolution controversy==

Both Price and Priestley, who were millennialists, saw the French Revolution of 1789 as fulfilment of prophecy. On the 101st anniversary of the Glorious Revolution, 4 November 1789, Price preached a sermon entitled &quot;A Discourse on the Love of Our Country&quot;, and ignited the pamphlet war known as the Revolution Controversy, on the political issues raised by the French Revolution. Price drew a bold parallel between the Glorious Revolution of 1688 (the one celebrated by the London Revolution Society dinner) and the French Revolution of 1789, arguing that the former had spread enlightened ideas and paved the way for the second one. Price exhorted the public to divest themselves of national prejudices and embrace &quot;universal benevolence&quot;, a concept of cosmopolitanism that entailed support for the French Revolution and the progress of &quot;enlightened&quot; ideas. It has been called &quot;one of the great political debates in British history&quot;. At the dinner of the London Revolution Society that followed, Price also suggested that the Society should send an address to the National Assembly in Paris. This was the start of a correspondence with many Jacobin clubs in Paris and elsewhere in France. Though the London Revolution Society and the Jacobin clubs agreed on basic tenets, their correspondence displayed a sense of growing misunderstanding as the French Jacobins grew more radical and their British correspondents, including Price, were not prepared to condone political violence. The Society&#x27;s Committee of Correspondence, which included Michael Dodson, took up the contact that was made with French Jacobins, though Price himself withdrew. At the same time, the Revolution Society joined with the Society for Constitutional Information in December 1789, at Price&#x27;s insistence, in condemning the Test Act and Corporation Act as defacing the British polity, with their restrictions on Dissenters.

Burke&#x27;s rebuttal in &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790) attacked Price, whose friends Paine and Wollstonecraft leapt into the fray to defend their mentor; William Coxe was another opponent, disagreeing with Price on interpretation of &quot;our country&quot;. In 1792 Christopher Wyvill published &quot;Defence of Dr. Price and the Reformers of England&quot;, a plea for reform and moderation.

==Later life==
In 1767 Price received the honorary degree of D.D. from the University of Aberdeen, and in 1769 another from the University of Glasgow. In 1786 Sarah Price died, and there had been no children by the marriage.

In the same year Price with other Dissenters founded Hackney New College. On 19 April 1791 Price died. He was buried at Bunhill Fields, where his funeral sermon was preached by Joseph Priestley.

His extended family included William Morgan, the actuary, and his brother George Cadogan Morgan (1754–1798), dissenting minister and scientist, both sons of Richard Price&#x27;s sister Sarah by William Morgan, a surgeon of Bridgend, Glamorganshire.

==Publications==
In 1744 Price published a volume of sermons. It was, however, as a writer on financial and political questions that Price became widely known. Price rejected traditional Christian notions of original sin and moral punishment, preaching the perfectibility of human nature, and he wrote on theological questions. He also wrote on finance, economics, probability, and life insurance.

===Thomas Bayes===
Price was asked to become literary executor of Thomas Bayes, the mathematician. He edited Bayes&#x27;s major work &quot;An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances&quot; (1763), which appeared in &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, and contains Bayes&#x27; Theorem, one of the fundamental results of probability theory. Price wrote an introduction to the paper, which provides some of the philosophical basis of Bayesian statistics. In 1765, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in recognition of his work on the legacy of Bayes.

===Demographer===

From about 1766 Price worked with the Society for Equitable Assurances. In 1769, in a letter to Benjamin Franklin, he made some observations on life expectancy, and the population of London, which were published in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; of that year. Price&#x27;s views included the detrimental effects of large cities, and the need for some constraints on commerce and movement of population.

In particular, Price took an interest in the figures of Franklin and Ezra Stiles on the colonial population in America, thought in some places to be doubling every 22 years. A debate on the British population had begun in the 1750s (with William Brakenridge, Richard Forster, Robert Wallace who pointed to manufacturing and smallpox as factors reducing population, and William Bell), but was inconclusive in the face of a lack of sound figures. The issue was of interest to European writers generally. The quantitative form of Price&#x27;s theory on the contrasting depopulation in England and Wales amounted to an approximate drop in population of 25 per cent since 1688. It was disputed numerically by Arthur Young in his &quot;Political Arithmetic&quot; (1774), which took in also criticism of the physiocrats.

In May 1770 Price presented to the Royal Society a paper on the proper method of calculating the values of contingent reversions. His book &quot;Observations on Reversionary Payments&quot; (1771) became a classic, in use for about a century, and providing the basis for financial calculations of insurance and benefit societies, of which many had recently been formed. The &quot;Northampton table&quot;, a life table compiled by Price with data from Northampton, became standard for about a century in actuarial work. It was used by life insurance companies such as Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical. It, too, overestimated mortality. In consequence, it was good for the insurance business, and adverse for those purchasing annuities. Price&#x27;s nephew William Morgan was an actuary, and became manager of the Equitable in 1775. He later wrote a memoir of Price&#x27;s life.

Price wrote a further &quot;Essay on the Population of England&quot; (2nd edition, 1780), which influenced Thomas Robert Malthus. Price&#x27;s continuing claim in it on British depopulation was challenged by John Howlett in 1781. Investigation of actual causes of ill-health began at this period, in a group of radical physicians around Priestley, including Price but centred on the Midlands and north-west: with John Aikin, Matthew Dobson, John Haygarth and Thomas Percival. Of these Haygarth and Percival supplied Price with figures, to supplement those he had collected himself in Northampton parishes.

===Public finance===
In 1771 Price published his &quot;Appeal to the Public on the Subject of the National Debt&quot; (ed. 1772 and 1774). This pamphlet excited considerable controversy, and is supposed to have influenced William Pitt the Younger in re-establishing the sinking fund for the extinction of the national debt, created by Robert Walpole in 1716 and abolished in 1733. The means proposed for the extinction of the debt are described by Lord Overstone as &quot;a sort of hocus-pocus machinery,&quot; supposed to work &quot;without loss to any one,&quot; and consequently unsound. Price&#x27;s views were attacked by John Brand in 1776. When Brand returned to finance and fiscal matters, &quot;Alteration of the Constitution of the House of Commons and the Inequality of the Land Tax&quot; (1793), he used work of Price, among others.

===Moral philosophy===
The &quot;Review of the Principal Questions in Morals&quot; (1758, 3rd ed. revised 1787) contains Price&#x27;s theory of ethics. The work is supposedly a refutation of Francis Hutcheson. Price represented a different tradition, deontological ethics rather than the virtue ethics of Hutcheson, going back to Samuel Clarke and John Balguy. The book is divided into ten chapters, the first of which gives his main ethical theory, allied to that of Ralph Cudworth. Other chapters show his relation to Joseph Butler and Immanuel Kant. Philosophically and politically Price had something in common with Thomas Reid. As a moralist Price is now regarded as a precursor to the rational intuitionism of the 20th century. He drew, among other sources, on Cicero and Panaetius, and has been labelled a &quot;British Platonist&quot;.

J. G. A. Pocock comments that Price was a moralist first, putting morality well ahead of democratic attachments. Price was widely criticised for that and for an absence of interest in civil society. As well as Burke, John Adams, Adam Ferguson and Josiah Tucker wrote against him. James Mackintosh wrote that Price was attempting to revive moral obligation. Théodore Simon Jouffroy preferred Price to Cudworth, Reid and Dugald Stewart. See also William Whewell&#x27;s &quot;History of Moral Philosophy in England&quot;; Alexander Bain&#x27;s &quot;Mental and Moral Sciences&quot;; and Thomas Fowler&#x27;s monograph on Shaftesbury and Hutcheson.

For Price, right and wrong belong to actions in themselves, and he rejects consequentialism. This ethical value is perceived by reason or understanding, which intuitively recognizes fitness or congruity between actions, agents and total circumstances. Arguing that ethical judgment is an act of discrimination, he endeavours to invalidate moral sense theory. He admits that right actions must be &quot;grateful&quot; to us; that, in fact, moral approbation includes both an act of the understanding and an emotion of the heart. Still it remains true that reason alone, in its highest development, would be a sufficient guide. In this conclusion he is in close agreement with Kant; reason is the arbiter, and right is

# not a matter of the emotions and
# no relative to imperfect human nature.

Price&#x27;s main point of difference with Cudworth is that while Cudworth regards the moral criterion as a νόημα or modification of the mind, existing in germ and developed by circumstances, Price regards it as acquired from the contemplation of actions, but acquired necessarily, immediately intuitively. In his view of disinterested action (ch. iii.) he follows Butler. Happiness he regards as the only end, conceivable by us, of divine Providence, but it is a happiness wholly dependent on rectitude. Virtue tends always to happiness, and in the end must produce it in its perfect form.

===Other works===
Price also wrote &quot;Fast-day Sermons&quot;, published respectively in 1779 and 1781. Throughout the American War, he preached sermons on fast-days and took the opportunity to attack Britain&#x27;s coercive policies toward the colonies. A complete list of his works was given as an appendix to Priestley&#x27;s &quot;Funeral Sermon&quot;.

==Commemoration==

Spray paint and laser cut stencil images of Price created by the artist Stewy were installed on the exterior wall of the John Percival Building at Cardiff University in 2022 in anticipation of the 300th anniversary of Price&#x27;s birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cardiff University/Prifysgol Caerdydd&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2023, an English Heritage blue plaque in honour of Price was installed on a wall at 54 Newington Green, where he lived, and close to the Newington Green Nonconformist chapel where he was a pastor. The plaque was unveiled by newsreader and journalist Huw Edwards. A series of events to celebrate Price&#x27;s tercentenary in 2023 has been organised in Llangeinor, his place of birth, around Wales and in London. The Richard Price Society commemorates Price in multiple ways.

<text>Jean-Pierre Serre (; born 15 September 1926) is a French mathematician who has made contributions to algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1954, the Wolf Prize in 2000 and the inaugural Abel Prize in 2003.

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Born in Bages, Pyrénées-Orientales, to pharmacist parents, Serre was educated at the Lycée de Nîmes. Then he studied at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris from 1945 to 1948. He was awarded his doctorate from the Sorbonne in 1951. From 1948 to 1954 he held positions at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris. In 1956 he was elected professor at the Collège de France, a position he held until his retirement in 1994. 

His wife, Professor Josiane Heulot-Serre, was a chemist; she also was the director of the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Jeunes Filles. Their daughter is the former French diplomat, historian and writer Claudine Monteil. The French mathematician Denis Serre is his nephew. He practices skiing, table tennis, and rock climbing (in Fontainebleau).

===Career===
From a very young age he was an outstanding figure in the school of Henri Cartan, working on algebraic topology, several complex variables and then commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, where he introduced sheaf theory and homological algebra techniques. Serre&#x27;s thesis concerned the Leray–Serre spectral sequence associated to a fibration. Together with Cartan, Serre established the technique of using Eilenberg–MacLane spaces for computing homotopy groups of spheres, which at that time was one of the major problems in topology.

In his speech at the Fields Medal award ceremony in 1954, Hermann Weyl gave high praise to Serre, and also made the point that the award was for the first time awarded to a non-analyst. Serre subsequently changed his research focus.

====Algebraic geometry====
In the 1950s and 1960s, a fruitful collaboration between Serre and the two-years-younger Alexander Grothendieck led to important foundational work, much of it motivated by the Weil conjectures. Two major foundational papers by Serre were &quot;Faisceaux Algébriques Cohérents&quot; (FAC, 1955), on coherent cohomology, and &quot;Géométrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique&quot; (GAGA, 1956).

Even at an early stage in his work Serre had perceived a need to construct more general and refined cohomology theories to tackle the Weil conjectures. The problem was that the cohomology of a coherent sheaf over a finite field could not capture as much topology as singular cohomology with integer coefficients. Amongst Serre&#x27;s early candidate theories of 1954–55 was one based on Witt vector coefficients.

Around 1958 Serre suggested that isotrivial principal bundles on algebraic varieties – those that become trivial after pullback by a finite étale map – are important. This acted as one important source of inspiration for Grothendieck to develop the étale topology and the corresponding theory of étale cohomology. These tools, developed in full by Grothendieck and collaborators in Séminaire de géométrie algébrique (SGA) 4 and SGA 5, provided the tools for the eventual proof of the Weil conjectures by Pierre Deligne.

====Other work====

From 1959 onward Serre&#x27;s interests turned towards group theory, number theory, in particular Galois representations and modular forms.

Amongst his most original contributions were: his &quot;Conjecture II&quot; (still open) on Galois cohomology; his use of group actions on trees (with Hyman Bass); the Borel–Serre compactification; results on the number of points of curves over finite fields; Galois representations in ℓ-adic cohomology and the proof that these representations have often a &quot;large&quot; image; the concept of p-adic modular form; and the Serre conjecture (now a theorem) on mod-&quot;p&quot; representations that made Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem a connected part of mainstream arithmetic geometry.

In his paper FAC, Serre asked whether a finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring is free. This question led to a great deal of activity in commutative algebra, and was finally answered in the affirmative by Daniel Quillen and Andrei Suslin independently in 1976. This result is now known as the Quillen–Suslin theorem.

==Honors and awards==
Serre, at twenty-seven in 1954, was and still is the youngest person ever to have been awarded the Fields Medal. He went on to win the Balzan Prize in 1985, the Steele Prize in 1995, the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 2000, and was the first recipient of the Abel Prize in 2003. He has been awarded other prizes, such as the Gold Medal of the French National Scientific Research Centre (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS).

He is a foreign member of several scientific Academies (US, Norway, Sweden, Russia, the Royal Society, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (1978), American Academy of Arts and Sciences, National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society) and has received many honorary degrees (from Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, Oslo and others). In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

Serre has been awarded the highest honors in France as Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour (Grand Croix de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur) and Grand Cross of the Legion of Merit (Grand Croix de l&#x27;Ordre National du Mérite).

<text>Adam Fredric Duritz (born August 1, 1964) is an American singer, best known as the frontman for the rock band Counting Crows, for which he serves as a founding member and principal composer. Since its founding in 1991, Counting Crows has sold over 20 million records, released seven studio albums that have been certified gold or platinum, and been nominated for two Grammy Awards and an Academy Award.

Duritz has recorded solo material of his own and has collaborated with other musical acts. He has also founded two record labels, &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus Records&quot;. His work scoring music for film earned an award from BMI for co-writing the song &quot;Accidentally in Love&quot; for the movie &quot;Shrek 2&quot;.

==Career==
Duritz and producer/guitarist David Bryson formed Counting Crows in San Francisco in 1991. When Gary Gersh of Geffen Records heard the band&#x27;s demo tape, he was &quot;blown away&quot;. A bidding war between nine different record labels broke out in February 1992. In April, the band—which, by that time, included other members—&quot;signed a deal with Gersh and Geffen believed to be so lucrative that industry wags dubbed them Accounting Crows&quot;.

The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;August and Everything After&quot;, charted within the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and the single &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; (1993) was a number-one hit in Canada. After the band performed as the music guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; jumped 40 spots in the charts. The album has been certified 7× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Six of the band&#x27;s albums have charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and four have been certified gold or platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Counting Crows was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 1994. The band also received a 2004 Academy Award nomination for the song &quot;Accidentally in Love&quot;, which was included in the film &quot;Shrek 2&quot;.

Duritz has collaborated with The Wallflowers (led by Jakob Dylan) on the album &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; on the track &quot;6th Avenue Heartache&quot;; with Ryan Adams on &quot;Gold&quot; and the song &quot;Butterfly in Reverse&quot; from &quot;Hard Candy&quot;; with Peter Stuart on &quot;Propeller&quot; and &quot;Daisy&quot;; with Live on &quot;V&quot;;, with Dashboard Confessional on the track &quot;So Long, So Long&quot; from &quot;Dusk and Summer&quot;, with Maria Taylor on the song &quot;Waiting In Line&quot;, and with Nanci Griffith on the song &quot;Going Back to Georgia&quot; on her album Flyer.

Duritz also contributed the songs &quot;Spin Around&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t See Me&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re a Star&quot; to the &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; soundtrack that was performed by the film&#x27;s fictional title band. Along with bandmates Dan Vickrey, Bryson, and Immerglück, Duritz co-wrote the song &quot;Accidentally in Love&quot; for the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Shrek 2&quot;, winning them each an award from BMI.

Duritz&#x27;s lyrics have been described as &quot;morose&quot; and &quot;tortured&quot; and as &quot;wordy introspection&quot;, while his vocals have been called &quot;expressive&quot;.

In October 2018, Duritz co-founded the Underwater Sunshine Music Festival.

Duritz co-founded the record label &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; in 1997. Before the label was purchased by new ownership, Duritz had signed Joe 90, Gigolo Aunts, and Neilson Hubbard. In 2007, Duritz launched a record label called &quot;Tyrannosaurus Records&quot;. Debut artists on the label included Notar and Blacktop Mourning. , the label was defunct.

Duritz was executive producer for the film &quot;The Locusts&quot; and produced the ensemble comedy film &quot;Freeloaders&quot;. He appeared in the 2007 mockumentary film &quot;Farce of the Penguins&quot;.

Duritz features prominently in Brian T. Atkinson&#x27;s &quot;Love at the Five and Dime: The Songwriting Legacy of Nanci Griffith&quot; (Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2024).

==Personal life==
Duritz is the son of Gilbert and Linda Duritz, both physicians. Duritz has a younger sister, Nicole. Duritz is Jewish.

Duritz has dissociative mental health issues. He disclosed this mental health issue publicly in 2008.

Duritz briefly dated actress Jennifer Aniston in 1995 after mutual friends got them together at The Viper Room. Duritz worked as a bartender at the venue for a period of time after the suicide of Kurt Cobain to help keep his head clear.

In the summer of 2009, he started dating Emmy Rossum. The pair broke up in 2010.

In August 2019, Duritz—who had &quot;rocked voluminous dreadlocks&quot; since Counting Crows was formed—traveled to London to shave them. He had previously revealed that the dreadlocks were extensions.

<doc id="205488" wikidata="Q333922" url="?curid=205488" title="William Whewell">
<text>William Whewell ( ; 24 May 17946 March 1866) was an English polymath, scientist, Anglican priest, philosopher, theologian, and historian of science. He was Master at Trinity College, Cambridge. In his time as a student there, he achieved distinction in both poetry and mathematics.

The breadth of Whewell&#x27;s endeavours is his most remarkable feature. In a time of increasing specialization, Whewell belonged in an earlier era when natural philosophers investigated widely. He published work in mechanics, physics, geology, astronomy, and economics, while also composing poetry, writing a Bridgewater Treatise, translating the works of Goethe, and writing sermons and theological tracts. In mathematics, Whewell introduced what is now called the Whewell equation, defining the shape of a curve without reference to an arbitrarily chosen coordinate system. He also organized thousands of volunteers internationally to study ocean tides, in what is now considered one of the first citizen science projects. He received the Royal Medal for this work in 1837.

One of Whewell&#x27;s greatest gifts to science was his word-smithing. He corresponded with many in his field and helped them come up with neologisms for their discoveries. Whewell coined, among other terms, scientist, physicist, linguistics, consilience, catastrophism, uniformitarianism, and astigmatism; he suggested to Michael Faraday the terms electrode, ion, dielectric, anode, and cathode.

Whewell died in Cambridge in 1866 as a result of a fall from his horse.

==Early life, education and marriages==

Whewell was born in Lancaster, the son of John Whewell and his wife, Elizabeth Bennison.
His father was a master carpenter, and wished him to follow his trade, but William&#x27;s success in mathematics at Lancaster Royal Grammar School and Heversham grammar school won him an exhibition (a type of scholarship) at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1812. He was the eldest of seven children having three brothers and three sisters born after him. Two of the brothers died as infants while the third died in 1812. Two of his sisters married; he corresponded with them in his career as a student and then a professor. His mother died in 1807, when Whewell was 13 years old. His father died in 1816, the year Whewell received his bachelor degree at Trinity College, but before his most significant professional accomplishments.

Whewell married, firstly, in 1841, Cordelia Marshall, daughter of John Marshall. Within days of his marriage, Whewell was recommended to be master of Trinity College in Cambridge, following Christopher Wordsworth. Cordelia died in 1855. In 1858 he married again, to Everina Frances (née Ellis), sister of Robert Leslie Ellis and widow of Sir Gilbert Affleck, 5th Baronet. She died in 1865. He had no children.

==Career==

In 1814 he was awarded the Chancellor&#x27;s Gold Medal for poetry. He was Second Wrangler in 1816, President of the Cambridge Union Society in 1817, became fellow and tutor of his college.

He was professor of mineralogy from 1828 to 1832 and Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy (then called &quot;moral theology and casuistical divinity&quot;) from 1838 to 1855. During the years as professor of philosophy, in 1841, Whewell succeeded Christopher Wordsworth as master.

Whewell influenced the syllabus of the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge, which undergraduates studied. He was a proponent of &#x27;mixed mathematics&#x27;: applied mathematics, descriptive geometry and mathematical physics, in contrast with pure mathematics. Under Whewell, analytic topics such as elliptical integrals were replaced by physical studies of electricity, heat and magnetism. He believed an intuitive geometrical understanding of mathematics, based on Euclid and Newton, was most appropriate.

==Death and legacy==
Whewell died in Cambridge in 1866 as a result of a fall from his horse. He was buried in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge, whilst his wives are buried together in the Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge. A window dedicated to Lady Affleck, his second wife, was installed in her memory in the chancel of All Saints&#x27; Church, Cambridge and made by Morris &amp; Co.

A list of his writings was prepared after his death by Isaac Todhunter in two volumes, the first being an index of the names of persons with whom Whewell corresponded. Another book was published five years later, as a biography of Whewell&#x27;s life interspersed with his letters to his father, his sisters, and other correspondence, written and compiled by his niece by marriage, Janet Mary Douglas, called Mrs Stair Douglas on the book&#x27;s title page. These books are available online in their entirety as part of the Internet Archive.

==Endeavours==

===History and development of science===

In 1826 and 1828, Whewell was engaged with George Airy in conducting experiments in Dolcoath mine in Cornwall, in order to determine the density of the earth. Their united labours were unsuccessful, and Whewell did little more in the way of experimental science. He was the author, however, of an &quot;Essay on Mineralogical Classification&quot;, published in 1828, and carried out extensive work on the tides.

When Whewell started his work on tides, there was a theory explaining the forces causing the tides, based on the work of Newton, Bernoulli, and Laplace. But this explained the forces, not how tides actually propagated in oceans bounded by continents. There was a series of tidal observations for a few ports, such as London and Liverpool, which allowed tide tables to be produced for these ports. However the methods used to create such tables, and in some cases the observations, were closely guarded trade secrets. John Lubbock, a former student of Whewell&#x27;s, had analysed the available historic data (covering up to 25 years) for several ports to allow tables to be generated on a theoretical basis, publishing the methodology. This work was supported by Francis Beaufort, Hydrographer of the Navy, and contributed to the publication of the &quot;Admiralty Tide Tables&quot; starting in 1833.

Whewell built on Lubbock&#x27;s work to develop an understanding of tidal patterns around the world that could be used to generate predictions for many locations without the need for long series of tidal observations at each port. This required extensive new observations, initially obtained through an informal network, and later through formal projects enabled by Beaufort at the Admiralty. In the first of these, in June 1834, every Coast Guard station in the United Kingdom recorded the tides every fifteen minutes for two weeks. The second, in June 1835, was an international collaboration, involving Admiralty Surveyors, other Royal Navy and British observers, as well as those from the United States, France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, and the Netherlands. Islands, such as the Channel Islands, were particularly interesting, adding important detail of the progress of the tides through the ocean. The Admiralty also provided the resources for data analysis, and J.F. Dessiou, an expert calculator on the Admiralty staff, was in charge of the calculations.

Whewell made extensive use of graphical methods, and these became not just ways of displaying results, but tools in the analysis of data. He published a number of maps showing cotidal lines (a term coined by Lubbock) – lines joining points where high tide occurred at the same time. These allowed a graphical representation of the progression of tidal waves through the ocean. From this, Whewell predicted that there should be a place where there was no tidal rise or fall in the southern part of the North Sea. Such a &quot;no-tide zone&quot; is now called an amphidromic point. In 1840, the naval surveyor William Hewett confirmed Whewell&#x27;s prediction. This involved anchoring his ship, HMS &quot;Fairy&quot;, and taking repeated soundings at the same location with lead and line, precautions being needed to allow for irregularities in the sea bed, and the effects of tidal flow. The data showed a rise of no more than . 

Whewell published about 20 papers over a period of 20 years on his tidal researches. This was his major scientific achievement, and was an important source for his understanding of the process of scientific enquiry, the subject of one of his major works &quot;Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences&quot;.

His best-known works are two voluminous books that attempt to systematize the development of the sciences, &quot;History of the Inductive Sciences&quot; (1837) and &quot;The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, Founded Upon Their History&quot; (1840, 1847, 1858–60). While the &quot;History&quot; traced how each branch of the sciences had evolved since antiquity, Whewell viewed the &quot;Philosophy&quot; as the &quot;Moral&quot; of the previous work as it sought to extract a universal theory of knowledge through history.

In the latter, he attempted to follow Francis Bacon&#x27;s plan for discovery. He examined ideas (&quot;explication of conceptions&quot;) and by the &quot;colligation of facts&quot; endeavored to unite these ideas with the facts and so construct science. This colligation is an &quot;act of thought&quot;, a mental operation consisting of bringing together a number of empirical facts by &quot;superinducing&quot; upon them a conception which unites the facts and renders them capable of being expressed in general laws. Whewell refers to as an example Kepler and the discovery of the elliptical orbit: the orbit&#x27;s points were &quot;colligated&quot; by the &quot;conception&quot; of the ellipse, not by the discovery of new facts. These conceptions are not &quot;innate&quot; (as in Kant), but being the fruits of the &quot;progress of scientific thought (history) are unfolded in clearness and distinctness&quot;.

===Whewell&#x27;s three steps of induction===
Whewell analyzed inductive reasoning into three steps:
* The selection of the (fundamental) idea, such as space, number, cause, or likeness (resemblance);
* The formation of the conception, or more special modification of those ideas, as a circle, a uniform force, etc.; and,
* The determination of magnitudes.

Upon these follow special methods of induction applicable to quantity: the method of curves, the method of means, the method of least squares and the method of residues, and special methods depending on resemblance (to which the transition is made through the law of continuity), such as the method of gradation and the method of natural classification. In &quot;Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences&quot; Whewell was the first to use the term &quot;consilience&quot; to discuss the unification of knowledge between the different branches of learning.

===Opponent of English empiricism===
Here, as in his ethical doctrine, Whewell was moved by opposition to contemporary English empiricism. Following Immanuel Kant, he asserted against John Stuart Mill the &quot;a priori&quot; nature of necessary truth, and by his rules for the construction of conceptions he dispensed with the inductive methods of Mill. Yet, according to Laura J. Snyder, &quot;surprisingly, the received view of Whewell&#x27;s methodology in the 20th century has tended to describe him as an anti-inductivist in the Popperian mold, that is it is claimed that Whewell endorses a &#x27;conjectures and refutations&#x27; view of scientific discovery. Whewell explicitly rejects the hypothetico-deductive claim that hypotheses discovered by non-rational guesswork can be confirmed by consequentialist testing. Whewell explained that new hypotheses are &#x27;collected from the facts&#x27; (Philosophy of Inductive Sciences, 1849, 17)&quot;. In sum, the scientific discovery is a partly empirical and partly rational process; the &quot;discovery of the conceptions is neither guesswork nor merely a matter of observations&quot;, we infer more than we see.

===Whewell&#x27;s neologisms===
One of Whewell&#x27;s greatest gifts to science was his wordsmithing. He often corresponded with many in his field and helped them come up with new terms for their discoveries. In fact, Whewell came up with the term &quot;scientist&quot; itself in 1833, and it was first published in Whewell&#x27;s anonymous 1834 review of Mary Somerville&#x27;s &quot;On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences&quot; published in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;. (They had previously been known as &quot;natural philosophers&quot; or &quot;men of science&quot;).

==Work in college administration==

Whewell was prominent not only in scientific research and philosophy but also in university and college administration. His first work, &quot;An Elementary Treatise on Mechanics&quot; (1819), cooperated with those of George Peacock and John Herschel in reforming the Cambridge method of mathematical teaching. His work and publications also helped influence the recognition of the moral and natural sciences as an integral part of the Cambridge curriculum.

In general, however, especially in later years, he opposed reform: he defended the tutorial system, and in a controversy with Connop Thirlwall (1834), opposed the admission of Dissenters; he upheld the clerical fellowship system, the privileged class of &quot;fellow-commoners&quot;, and the authority of heads of colleges in university affairs.

He opposed the appointment of the University Commission (1850) and wrote two pamphlets (&quot;Remarks&quot;) against the reform of the university (1855). He stood against the scheme of entrusting elections to the members of the senate and instead, advocated the use of college funds and the subvention of scientific and professorial work.

He was elected Master of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1841, and retained that position until his death in 1866.

The Whewell Professorship of International Law and the Whewell Scholarships were established through the provisions of his will.

==Whewell&#x27;s interests in architecture==
Aside from Science, Whewell was also interested in the history of architecture throughout his life. He is best known for his writings on Gothic architecture, specifically his book, &quot;Architectural Notes on German Churches&quot; (first published in 1830). In this work, Whewell established a strict nomenclature for German Gothic churches and came up with a theory of stylistic development. His work is associated with the &quot;scientific trend&quot; of architectural writers, along with Thomas Rickman and Robert Willis.

He paid from his own resources for the construction of two new courts of rooms at Trinity College, Cambridge, built in a Gothic style. The two courts were completed in 1860 and (posthumously) in 1868, and are now collectively named Whewell&#x27;s Court (in the singular).

==Whewell&#x27;s works in philosophy and morals==

Between 1835 and 1861 Whewell produced various works on the philosophy of morals and politics, the chief of which, &quot;Elements of Morality&quot;, including &quot;Polity&quot;, was published in 1845. The peculiarity of this work—written from what is known as the intuitional point of view—is its fivefold division of the springs of action and of their objects, of the primary and universal rights of man (personal security, property, contract, family rights, and government), and of the cardinal virtues (, justice, truth, and order).

Among Whewell&#x27;s other works—too numerous to mention—were popular writings such as: 
* the third &quot;Bridgewater Treatise&quot;, &quot;Astronomy and General Physics considered with reference to Natural Theology&quot; (1833),
* the two volumes treatise &quot;The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences: Founded Upon Their History&quot; (1840), 
* the essay &quot;Of the Plurality of Worlds&quot; (1853), in which he argued against the probability of life on other planets, 
* the &quot;Platonic Dialogues for English Readers&quot; (1850–1861), 
* the &quot;Lectures on the History of Moral Philosophy in England&quot; (1852), 
* the essay, &quot;Of a Liberal Education in General, with particular reference to the Leading Studies of the University of Cambridge&quot; (1845), 
* the important edition and abridged translation of Hugo Grotius, &quot;De jure belli ac pacis&quot; (1853), and 
* the edition of the &quot;Mathematical Works&quot; of Isaac Barrow (1860).

Whewell was one of the Cambridge dons whom Charles Darwin met during his education there, and when Darwin returned from the &quot;Beagle&quot; voyage he was directly influenced by Whewell, who persuaded Darwin to become secretary of the Geological Society of London. The title pages of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; open with a quotation from Whewell&#x27;s &quot;Bridgewater Treatise&quot; about science founded on a natural theology of a creator establishing laws:

But with regard to the material world, we can at least go so far as this—we can perceive that events are brought about not by insulated interpositions of Divine power, exerted in each particular case, but by the establishment of general laws.

Though Darwin used the concepts of Whewell as he made and tested his hypotheses regarding the theory of evolution, Whewell did not support Darwin&#x27;s theory itself.

&quot;Whewell also famously opposed the idea of evolution. First he published a new book, &quot;Indications of the Creator&quot;, 1845, composed of extracts from his earlier works to counteract the popular anonymous evolutionary work &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot;. Later Whewell opposed Darwin&#x27;s theories of evolution.&quot;

<text>The inex (plural &quot;inexes&quot;) is an eclipse cycle of 10,571.95 days (about 29 years minus 20 days). The cycle was first described in modern times by Crommelin in 1901, but was named by George van den Bergh who studied it in detail half a century later. One inex after an eclipse of a particular saros series there will be an eclipse in the next saros series, unless the latter saros series has come to an end.

It corresponds to:
*10,571.95 solar days
*28.95 years
*358 synodic months
*388.50011 draconic months
*30.50011 eclipse years (61 eclipse seasons)
*383.67351 anomalistic months
*386.94 sidereal months
*8 eclipse sets

The 30.5 eclipse years means that if there is a solar eclipse (or lunar eclipse), then after one inex a New Moon (resp. Full Moon) will take place at the opposite node of the orbit of the Moon, and under these circumstances another eclipse can occur.

Unlike the saros, the inex is not close to an integer number of &quot;anomalistic months&quot; so successive eclipses are not very similar in their appearance and characteristics. From the remainder of 0.67351, being near , every third eclipse will have a similar position in the moon&#x27;s elliptical orbit and apparent diameter, so the quality of the solar eclipse (total versus annular) will repeat in these groupings of 3 cycles (87 years minus 2 months), called triads. 

Inex series last much longer than saros series. For example, inex series 30 started in saros series −245 in 9435 BC and will continue well beyond 15,000 AD. But inex series are not unbroken: at the beginning and end of a series, eclipses may fail to occur. However once settled down, inex series are very stable and run for many thousands of years. For example, series 30 has produced eclipses every 29 years since saros series −197 in 8045 BC, including most recently the solar eclipse of February 5, 2000.

An inex also is close to an integer number of days (10,571.95) so solar eclipses on average take place at about the same geographical longitude at successive events, although variations of the moon&#x27;s speed at different points of its orbit mask this relation. In addition sequential events occur at opposite geographical latitudes because the eclipses occur at opposite nodes. This is in contrast to the better known saros, which has a period of about days, so successive solar eclipses tend to take place about 120° in longitude apart on the globe (although at the same node and hence at about the same geographical latitude).

The significance of the inex cycle is not in the prediction, but in the organization of eclipses: any eclipse cycle, and indeed the interval between any two eclipses, can be expressed as a combination of saros and inex intervals.

== Solar Saros-Inex panorama ==

A saros-inex panorama has been produced by Luca Quaglia and John Tilley. It shows 61775 solar eclipses from −11000 (11001 BC) to +15000.

Each column of the graph is a complete Saros series which progresses smoothly from partial eclipses into total or annular eclipses and back into partials. Each graph row represents an inex series.

The lifetime of each inex series is not simple due to long-term period variations in the synodic and draconic month lengths. One can see from the data file that in the future (around saros series 300) the graph is horizontal (meaning that after an interval of an inex the moon will be at the same latitude), whereas at the beginning of the panorama around 11,000 BC for the moon to come back to the same latitude at another eclipse required about one saros for every ten inex. This implies that back then 3580+223 or 3803 synodic months equaled 3885+242 or 4127 draconic months. So a synodic month was about 1.0851959 draconic months, as compared to about 1.0851958 today. This decrease by about 0.1 ppm can be compared to the decrease in the length of a tropical year by about 1 ppm in the last 10,000 years (see Tropical year). (Note that if the length of a sidereal month were constant, then a decrease in the length of a year would cause an &quot;increase&quot; in the length of a synodic month.) One source states that the draconic month is increasing by about 0.4 seconds (ca 0.16 ppm) per millennium whereas the synodic month is increasing by about 0.2 seconds (ca 0.08 ppm) per millennium, but doesn&#x27;t explain why the draconic month is increasing faster.

From the data file we can see that eclipses recur with a period of a combination of 15 inex and 1 saros (5593 synodic months, 165164.58 days, or 452.2 tropical years) throughout the whole panorama (26,000 years), for example from the eclipse of saros series −290, inex series 2 (slightly off the panorama to the left) to the eclipse of saros series 580, inex series 60 on the right-side edge of the panorama. Similar cycles with more or less than 15 inex per saros also cover the whole panorama.

== Lunar Saros-Inex panorama ==

Lunar eclipses can also be plotted in a similar diagram, this diagram covering 1000 AD to 2500 AD. The yellow diagonal band represents all the eclipses from 1900 to 2100. This graph immediately illuminates that this 1900–2100 period contains an above average number of total lunar eclipses compared to other adjacent centuries.

<text>An exeligmos () is a period of 54 years, 33 days that can be used to predict successive eclipses with similar properties and location. For a solar eclipse, after every exeligmos a solar eclipse of similar characteristics will occur in a location close to the eclipse before it. For a lunar eclipse the same part of the earth will view an eclipse that is very similar to the one that occurred one exeligmos before it (see main text for visual examples). The exeligmos is an eclipse cycle that is a triple saros, three saroses (or saroi) long, with the advantage that it has nearly an integer number of days so the next eclipse will be visible at locations and times near the eclipse that occurred one exeligmos earlier. In contrast, each saros, an eclipse occurs about eight hours later in the day or about 120° to the west of the eclipse that occurred one saros earlier.

It corresponds to:
*
* ()

The 57 eclipse years means that if there is a solar eclipse (or lunar eclipse), then after one exeligmos a New Moon (resp. Full Moon) will take place at the same node of the orbit of the Moon, and under these circumstances another eclipse can occur.

== Details ==
The Greeks had knowledge of the exeligmos by at latest 100 BC. A Greek astronomical clock called the Antikythera mechanism used epicyclic gearing to predict the dates of consecutive exeligmoses.

The exeligmos is 669 synodic months (every eclipse cycle must be an integer number of synodic months), almost exactly 726 draconic months (which ensures the sun and moon are in alignment during the new moon), and also almost exactly 717 anomalistic months (ensuring the moon is at the same point of its elliptic orbit). It also corresponds to 114 eclipse seasons. The first two factors make this a long-lasting eclipse series. The latter factor is what makes all the eclipses in an exeligmos so similar. The near-integer number of anomalistic months ensures that the apparent diameter of the moon will be nearly the same with each successive eclipse. The fact that it is very nearly a whole integer of days ensures each successive eclipse in the series occurs very close to the previous eclipse in the series.
For each successive eclipse in an exeligmos series the longitude and latitude can change significantly because an exeligmos is over a month longer than a calendar year, and the gamma increases/decreases because an exeligmos is about three hours shorter than a draconic month. The sun&#x27;s apparent diameter also changes significantly in one month, affecting the length and width of a solar eclipse.

<text>Richard McKay Rorty (October 4, 1931 – June 8, 2007) was an American philosopher and historian of ideas. Educated at the University of Chicago and Yale University, Rorty&#x27;s academic career included appointments as the Stuart Professor of Philosophy at Princeton University, the Kenan Professor of Humanities at the University of Virginia, and as a professor of comparative literature at Stanford University. Among his most influential books are &quot;Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature&quot; (1979), &quot;Consequences of Pragmatism&quot; (1982), and &quot;Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity&quot; (1989).

Rorty rejected the long-held idea that correct internal representations of objects in the outside world are a necessary prerequisite for knowledge. Rorty argued instead that knowledge is an &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;linguistic&quot; affair; knowledge relates only to our own language. Rorty argues that language is made up of vocabularies that are temporary and historical, and concludes that &quot;since vocabularies are made by human beings, so are truths&quot;. The acceptance of the preceding arguments leads to what Rorty calls &quot;ironism&quot;; a state of mind where people are completely aware that their knowledge is dependent on their time and place in history, and are therefore somewhat detached from their own beliefs. However, Rorty also argues that &quot;a belief can still regulate action, can still be thought worth dying for, among people who are quite aware that this belief is caused by nothing deeper than contingent historical circumstance&quot;.

==Biography==
Richard Rorty was born on October 4, 1931, in New York City. His parents, James and Winifred Rorty, were activists, writers and social democrats. His maternal grandfather, Walter Rauschenbusch, was a central figure in the Social Gospel movement of the early 20th century.

His father experienced two nervous breakdowns in his later life. The second breakdown, which he had in the early 1960s, was more serious and &quot;included claims to divine prescience.&quot; Consequently, Richard Rorty fell into depression as a teenager and in 1962 began a six-year psychiatric analysis for obsessional neurosis. Rorty wrote about the beauty of rural New Jersey orchids in his short autobiography, &quot;Trotsky and the Wild Orchids,&quot; and his desire to combine aesthetic beauty and social justice. His colleague Jürgen Habermas&#x27;s obituary for Rorty points out that Rorty&#x27;s childhood experiences led him to a vision of philosophy as the reconciliation of &quot;the celestial beauty of orchids with Trotsky&#x27;s dream of justice on earth.&quot; Habermas describes Rorty as an ironist:

Nothing is sacred to Rorty the ironist. Asked at the end of his life about the &quot;holy&quot;, the strict atheist answered with words reminiscent of the young Hegel: &quot;My sense of the holy is bound up with the hope that some day my remote descendants will live in a global civilization in which love is pretty much the only law.&quot;

Rorty enrolled at the University of Chicago shortly before turning 15, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s and a master&#x27;s degree in philosophy (studying under Richard McKeon), continuing at Yale University for a PhD in philosophy (1952–1956). He married another academic, Amélie Oksenberg (Harvard University professor), with whom he had a son, Jay Rorty, in 1954. After two years in the U.S. Army, he taught at Wellesley College for three years until 1961. Rorty divorced his wife and then married Stanford University bioethicist Mary Varney in 1972. They had two children, Kevin and Patricia, now Max. While Richard Rorty was a &quot;strict atheist&quot; (Habermas), Mary Varney Rorty was a practicing Mormon.

Rorty was a professor of philosophy at Princeton University for 21 years. In 1981, he was a recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship, commonly known as the &quot;Genius Grant&quot;, in its first year of awarding, and in 1982 he became Kenan Professor of the Humanities at the University of Virginia, working closely with colleagues and students in multiple departments, especially in English. In 1998 Rorty became professor of comparative literature (and philosophy, by courtesy), at Stanford University, where he spent the remainder of his academic career. During this period he was especially popular, and once quipped that he had been assigned to the position of &quot;transitory professor of trendy studies.&quot;

Rorty&#x27;s doctoral dissertation, &quot;The Concept of Potentiality&quot; was a historical study of the concept, completed under the supervision of Paul Weiss, but his first book (as editor), &quot;The Linguistic Turn&quot; (1967), was firmly in the prevailing analytic mode, collecting classic essays on the linguistic turn in analytic philosophy. However, he gradually became acquainted with the American philosophical movement known as pragmatism, particularly the writings of John Dewey. The noteworthy work being done by analytic philosophers such as Willard Van Orman Quine and Wilfrid Sellars caused significant shifts in his thinking, which were reflected in his next book, &quot;Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature&quot; (1979).

Pragmatists generally hold that the meaning of a proposition is determined by its use in linguistic practice. Rorty combined pragmatism about truth and other matters with a later Wittgensteinian philosophy of language, which declares that meaning is a social-linguistic product, and sentences do not &quot;link up&quot; with the world in a correspondence relation. Rorty wrote in &quot;Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity&quot; (1989):

Truth cannot be out there—cannot exist independently of the human mind—because sentences cannot so exist, or be out there. The world is out there, but descriptions of the world are not. Only descriptions of the world can be true or false. The world on its own unaided by the describing activities of humans cannot. (p. 5)

Views like this led Rorty to question many of philosophy&#x27;s most basic assumptions—and also led to his being apprehended as a postmodern/deconstructionist philosopher. Indeed, from the late 1980s through the 1990s, Rorty focused on the continental philosophical tradition, examining the works of Friederich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Michel Foucault, Jean-François Lyotard and Jacques Derrida. His work from this period includes &quot;Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity&quot; (1989), &quot;Essays on Heidegger and Others: Philosophical Papers&quot; &quot;II&quot; (1991), and &quot;Truth and Progress: Philosophical Papers III&quot; (1998). The latter two works attempt to bridge the dichotomy between analytic and continental philosophy by claiming that the two traditions complement rather than oppose each other.

According to Rorty, analytic philosophy may not have lived up to its pretensions and may not have solved the puzzles it thought it had. Yet such philosophy, in the process of finding reasons for putting those pretensions and puzzles aside, helped earn itself an important place in the history of ideas. By giving up on the quest for apodicticity and finality that Edmund Husserl shared with Rudolf Carnap and Bertrand Russell, and by finding new reasons for thinking that such quest will never succeed, analytic philosophy cleared a path that leads past scientism, just as the German idealists cleared a path that led around empiricism.

In the last fifteen years of his life, Rorty continued to publish his writings, including &quot;Philosophy as Cultural Politics (Philosophical Papers IV), and&quot; &quot;Achieving Our Country&quot; (1998), a political manifesto partly based on readings of Dewey and Walt Whitman in which he defended the idea of a progressive, pragmatic left against what he felt were defeatist, anti-liberal, anti-humanist positions espoused by the critical left and continental school. Rorty felt these anti-humanist positions were personified by figures like Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Foucault. Such theorists were also guilty of an &quot;inverted Platonism&quot; in which they attempted to craft overarching, metaphysical, &quot;sublime&quot; philosophies—which in fact contradicted their core claims to be ironist and contingent.

According to Eduardo Mendieta &quot;Rorty described himself as a &#x27;postmodern bourgeois liberal&#x27;, even if he also attacked the academic left, though not for being anti-truth, but for being unpatriotic. Rorty’s Zen attitude about truth could easily be confused for a form of political relativism—a Machiavellian type of politics.&quot;

Rorty&#x27;s last works, after his move to Stanford University concerned the place of religion in contemporary life, liberal communities, comparative literature and philosophy as &quot;cultural politics.&quot;

Shortly before his death, he wrote a piece called &quot;The Fire of Life&quot; (published in the November 2007 issue of &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine) in which he meditates on his diagnosis and the comfort of poetry. He concludes:

I now wish that I had spent somewhat more of my life with verse. This is not because I fear having missed out on truths that are incapable of statement in prose. There are no such truths; there is nothing about death that Swinburne and Landor knew but Epicurus and Heidegger failed to grasp. Rather, it is because I would have lived more fully if I had been able to rattle off more old chestnuts—just as I would have if I had made more close friends. Cultures with richer vocabularies are more fully human—farther removed from the beasts—than those with poorer ones; individual men and women are more fully human when their memories are amply stocked with verses.

On June 8, 2007, Rorty died in his home from pancreatic cancer.

==Major works==

===&quot;Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature&quot;===

In &quot;Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature&quot; (1979) Rorty argues that the central problems of modern epistemology depend upon a picture of the mind as trying to faithfully represent (or &quot;mirror&quot;) a mind-independent, external reality. When we give up this metaphor, the entire enterprise of foundationalist epistemology simply dissolves.

An epistemological foundationalist believes that in order to avoid the regress inherent in claiming that all beliefs are justified by other beliefs, some beliefs must be self-justifying and form the foundations to all knowledge. Rorty however criticized both the idea that arguments can be based upon self-evident premises (within language) and the idea that arguments can be based upon noninferential sensations (outside language).

The first critique draws on Quine&#x27;s work on sentences thought to be analytically true – that is, sentences thought to be true solely by virtue of what they mean and independently of fact. Quine argues that the problem with analytically true sentences is the attempt to &quot;convert&quot; identity-based but empty analytical truths like &quot;no unmarried man is married&quot; to synonymity-based analytical truths like &quot;no bachelor is married.&quot; When trying to do so, one must first prove that &quot;unmarried man&quot; and &quot;bachelor&quot; means exactly the same, and that is not possible without considering facts – that is, looking towards the domain of synthetic truths. When doing so, one will notice that the two concepts actually differ; &quot;bachelor&quot; sometimes mean &quot;bachelor of arts&quot; for instance. Quine therefore argues that &quot;a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn&quot;, and concludes that this boundary or distinction &quot;[...] is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith.&quot;

The second critique draws on Sellars&#x27;s work on the empiricist idea that there is a non-linguistic but epistemologically relevant &quot;given&quot; available in sensory perception. Sellars argue that only language can work as a foundation for arguments; non-linguistic sensory perceptions are incompatible with language and are therefore irrelevant. In Sellars&#x27; view, the claim that there is an epistemologically relevant &quot;given&quot; in sensory perception is a myth; a fact is not something that is &quot;given&quot; to us, it is something that we as language-users actively &quot;take&quot;. Only after we have learned a language is it possible for us to construe as &quot;empirical data&quot; the particulars and arrays of particulars we have come to be able to observe.

Each critique, taken alone, provides a problem for a conception of how philosophy ought to proceed but leaves enough of the tradition intact to proceed with its former aspirations. Combined, Rorty claimed, the two critiques are devastating. With no privileged realm of truth or meaning that can work as a self-evident foundation for our arguments, we have instead only truth defined as beliefs that pay their way: in other words, beliefs that are useful to us somehow. The only worthwhile description of the actual process of inquiry, Rorty claimed, was a Kuhnian account of the standard phases of the progress of disciplines, oscillating through normal and abnormal periods, between routine problem-solving and intellectual crises.

After rejecting foundationalism, Rorty argues that one of the few roles left for a philosopher is to act as an intellectual gadfly, attempting to induce a revolutionary break with previous practice, a role that Rorty was happy to take on himself. Rorty suggests that each generation tries to subject all disciplines to the model that the most successful discipline of the day employs. In Rorty&#x27;s view, the success of modern science has led academics in philosophy and the humanities to mistakenly imitate scientific methods.

===&quot;Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity&quot;===

In &quot;Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity&quot; (1989), Rorty argues that there is no worthwhile theory of truth, aside from the non-epistemic semantic theory Donald Davidson developed (based on the work of Alfred Tarski). Rorty also suggests that there are two kinds of philosophers; philosophers occupied with &quot;private&quot; or &quot;public&quot; matters. Private philosophers, who provide one with greater abilities to (re)create oneself (a view adapted from Nietzsche and which Rorty also identifies with the novels of Marcel Proust and Vladimir Nabokov) should not be expected to help with public problems. For a public philosophy, one might instead turn to philosophers like Rawls or Habermas, even though, according to Rorty, the latter is a &quot;liberal who doesn&#x27;t want to be an ironist&quot;. While Habermas believes that his &quot;theory of communicative rationality&quot; constitutes an update of rationalism, Rorty thinks that the latter and any &quot;universal&quot; pretensions should be totally abandoned.

This book also marks his first attempt to specifically articulate a political vision consistent with his philosophy, the vision of a diverse community bound together by opposition to cruelty, and not by abstract ideas such as &quot;justice&quot; or &quot;common humanity.&quot; Consistent with his anti-foundationalism, Rorty states that there is &quot;no noncircular theoretical backup for the belief that cruelty is horrible.&quot;

Rorty also introduces the terminology of ironism, which he uses to describe his mindset and his philosophy. Rorty describes the ironist as a person who &quot;worries that the process of socialization which turned her into a human being by giving her a language may have given her the wrong language, and so turned her into the wrong kind of human being. But she cannot give a criterion of wrongness.&quot;

===&quot;Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth&quot;===
Rorty describes the project of this essay collection as trying to &quot;offer an antirepresentationalist account of the relation between natural science and the rest of culture.&quot; Amongst the essays in &quot;Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth: Philosophical Papers, Volume 1&quot; (1990), is &quot;The Priority of Democracy to Philosophy,&quot; in which Rorty defends Rawls against communitarian critics. Rorty argues that liberalism can &quot;get along without philosophical presuppositions,&quot; while at the same time conceding to communitarians that &quot;a conception of the self that makes the community constitutive of the self does comport well with liberal democracy.&quot; Moreover, for Rorty Rawls could be compared to Habermas, a sort of United States&#x27; Habermas, with E. Mendieta&#x27;s words: &quot;An Enlightenment figure who thought that all we have is communicative reason and the use of public reason, two different names for the same thing—the use of reason by a public for the purpose of deciding how to live collectively and what aims should be the goal of the public good&quot;.
For Rorty, social institutions ought to be thought of as &quot;experiments in cooperation rather than as attempts to embody a universal and ahistorical order.&quot;

===&quot;Essays on Heidegger and Others&quot;===
In this text, Rorty focuses primarily on the continental philosophers Martin Heidegger and Jacques Derrida. He argues that these European &quot;post-Nietzscheans&quot; share much with American pragmatists, in that they critique metaphysics and reject the correspondence theory of truth. Taking up and developing what he had argued in previous works, Rorty claims that Derrida is most useful when viewed as a funny writer who attempted to circumvent the Western philosophical tradition, rather than the inventor of a philosophical (or literary) &quot;method&quot;. In this vein, Rorty criticizes Derrida&#x27;s followers like Paul de Man for taking deconstructive literary theory too seriously.

===&quot;Achieving Our Country&quot;===

In &quot;Achieving Our Country: Leftist Thought in Twentieth-Century America&quot; (1998), Rorty differentiates between what he sees as the two sides of the Left, a cultural Left and a progressive Left. He criticizes the cultural Left, which is exemplified by post-structuralists such as Foucault and postmodernists such as Lyotard, for offering critiques of society, but no alternatives (or alternatives that are so vague and general as to be abdications). Although these intellectuals make insightful claims about the ills of society, Rorty suggests that they provide no alternatives and even occasionally deny the possibility of progress. On the other hand, the progressive Left, exemplified for Rorty by the pragmatist John Dewey, Whitman and James Baldwin, makes hope for a better future its priority. Without hope, Rorty argues, change is spiritually inconceivable and the cultural Left has begun to breed cynicism. Rorty sees the progressive Left as acting in the philosophical spirit of pragmatism.

==On human rights==
Rorty&#x27;s notion of human rights is grounded on the notion of sentimentality. He contended that throughout history humans have devised various means of construing certain groups of individuals as inhuman or subhuman. Thinking in rationalist (foundationalist) terms will not solve this problem, he claimed. Rorty advocated the creation of a culture of global human rights in order to stop violations from happening through a sentimental education. He argued that we should create a sense of empathy or teach empathy to others so as to understand others&#x27; suffering.

==On hope==
Rorty advocates for what philosopher Nick Gall characterizes as a &quot;boundless hope&quot; or type of &quot;melancholic meliorism.&quot; According to this view, Rorty replaces foundationalist hopes for certainty with those of perpetual growth and constant change, which he believes enables us to send conversation and hopes in new directions we currently can&#x27;t imagine.

Rorty articulates this boundless hope in his 1982 book &quot;Consequences of Pragmatism,&quot; where he applies his framework of wholesale hope versus retail hope. Herein he says, &quot;Let me sum up by offering a third and final characterization of pragmatism: It is the doctrine that there are no constraints on inquiry save conversational ones-no wholesale constraints derived from the nature of the objects, or of the mind, or of language, but only those retail constraints provided by the remarks of our fellow inquirers.&quot;

==Reception and criticism==
Rorty is among the most widely discussed and controversial contemporary philosophers, and his works have provoked thoughtful responses from many other well-respected figures in the field. In Robert Brandom&#x27;s anthology &quot;Rorty and His Critics&quot;, for example, Rorty&#x27;s philosophy is discussed by Donald Davidson, Jürgen Habermas, Hilary Putnam, John McDowell, Jacques Bouveresse, and Daniel Dennett, among others. In 2007, Roger Scruton wrote, &quot;Rorty was paramount among those thinkers who advance their own opinion as immune to criticism, by pretending that it is not truth but consensus that counts, while defining the consensus in terms of people like themselves.&quot; Ralph Marvin Tumaob concludes that Rorty was influenced by Jean-François Lyotard&#x27;s metanarratives, and added that &quot;postmodernism was influenced further by the works of Rorty&quot;.

McDowell is strongly influenced by Rorty, particularly &quot;Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature&quot; (1979). In continental philosophy, authors such as Jürgen Habermas, Gianni Vattimo, Jacques Derrida, Albrecht Wellmer, Hans Joas, Chantal Mouffe, Simon Critchley, Esa Saarinen, and Mike Sandbothe are influenced in different ways by Rorty&#x27;s thinking. American novelist David Foster Wallace titled a short story in his collection &quot;&quot; &quot;Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature,&quot; and critics have identified Rorty&#x27;s influence in some of Wallace&#x27;s writings on irony.

Susan Haack has been a fierce critic of Rorty&#x27;s neopragmatism. Haack criticises Rorty&#x27;s claim to be a pragmatist at all and wrote a short play called &quot;We Pragmatists&quot;, where Rorty and Charles Sanders Peirce have a fictional conversation using only accurate quotes from their own writing. For Haack, the only link between Rorty&#x27;s neopragmatism and Peirce&#x27;s pragmatism is the name. Haack believes Rorty&#x27;s neopragmatism is anti-philosophical and anti-intellectual, and exposes people further to rhetorical manipulation.

Although Rorty was an avowed liberal, his political and moral philosophies have been attacked by commentators from the Left, some of whom believe them to be insufficient frameworks for social justice. Rorty was also criticized for his rejection of the idea that science can depict the world. One criticism, especially of &quot;Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity&quot;, is that Rorty&#x27;s philosophical hero, the ironist, is an elitist figure. Rorty argues that most people would be &quot;commonsensically nominalist and historicist&quot; but not ironist. They would combine an ongoing attention to the particular as opposed to the transcendent (nominalism) with an awareness of their place in a continuum of contingent lived experience alongside other individuals (historicist), without necessarily having continual doubts about the resulting worldview as the ironist does. An ironist is someone who &quot;has radical and continuing doubts about their final vocabulary&quot;, that is &quot;a set of words which they [humans] employ to justify their actions, their beliefs, and their lives&quot;; &quot;realizes that argument phrased in their vocabulary can neither underwrite nor dissolve these doubts&quot;; and &quot;does not think their vocabulary is closer to reality than others&quot;. On the other hand, the Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo and the Spanish philosopher Santiago Zabala in their 2011 book &quot;Hermeneutic Communism: from Heidegger to Marx&quot; affirm that together with Richard Rorty we also consider it a flaw that &quot;the main thing contemporary academic Marxists inherit from Marx and Engels is the conviction that the quest for the cooperative commonwealth should be scientific rather than utopian, knowing rather than romantic.&quot; As we will show hermeneutics contains all the utopian and romantic features that Rorty refers to because, contrary to the knowledge of science, it does not claim modern universality but rather postmodern particularism.

Rorty often draws on a broad range of other philosophers to support his views, and his interpretation of their work has been contested. Since he is working from a tradition of reinterpretation, he is not interested in &quot;accurately&quot; portraying other thinkers, but rather in using it in the same way a literary critic might use a novel. His essay &quot;The Historiography of Philosophy: Four Genres&quot; is a thorough description of how he treats the greats in the history of philosophy. In &quot;Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity&quot;, Rorty attempts to disarm those who criticize his writings by arguing that their philosophical criticisms are made using axioms that are explicitly rejected within Rorty&#x27;s own philosophy. For instance, he defines allegations of irrationality as affirmations of vernacular &quot;otherness&quot;, and so—Rorty argues—accusations of irrationality can be expected during &quot;any&quot; argument and must simply be brushed aside.

<text>Sir George Biddell Airy (; 27 July 18012 January 1892) was an English mathematician and astronomer, as well as the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics from 1826 to 1828 and the seventh Astronomer Royal from 1835 to 1881. His many achievements include work on planetary orbits, measuring the mean density of the Earth, a method of solution of two-dimensional problems in solid mechanics and, in his role as Astronomer Royal, establishing Greenwich as the location of the prime meridian.

==Biography==
Airy was born at Alnwick in Northumberland, one of a long line of Airys who traced their descent back to a family of the same name residing at Kentmere, in Westmorland, in the 14th century. The branch to which he belonged, having suffered in the English Civil War, moved to Lincolnshire and became farmers. Airy was educated first at elementary schools in Hereford, and afterwards at Colchester Royal Grammar School. An introverted child, Airy gained popularity with his schoolmates through his great skill in the construction of peashooters.

From the age of 13, Airy stayed frequently with his uncle, Arthur Biddell at Playford, Suffolk. Biddell introduced Airy to his friend Thomas Clarkson, the slave trade abolitionist who lived at Playford Hall. Clarkson had an MA in mathematics from Cambridge, and examined Airy in classics and then subsequently arranged for him to be examined by a Fellow from Trinity College, Cambridge on his knowledge of mathematics. As a result, he entered Trinity in 1819, as a sizar, meaning that he paid a reduced fee but essentially worked as a servant to make good the fee reduction. Here he had a brilliant career, and seems to have been almost immediately recognised as the leading man of his year. In 1822 he was elected scholar of Trinity, and in the following year he graduated as senior wrangler and obtained first Smith&#x27;s Prize. On 1 October 1824 he was elected fellow of Trinity, and in December 1826 was appointed Lucasian professor of mathematics in succession to Thomas Turton. This chair he held for little more than a year, being elected in February 1828 Plumian professor of astronomy and director of the new Cambridge Observatory. In 1836 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1840, a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1859 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

===Research===

Some idea of his activity as a writer on mathematical and physical subjects during these early years may be gathered from the fact that previous to this appointment he had contributed three important memoirs to the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; of the Royal Society, and eight to the Cambridge Philosophical Society. At the Cambridge Observatory Airy soon showed his power of organisation. The only telescope in the establishment when he took charge was the transit instrument, and to this he vigorously devoted himself. By the adoption of a regular system of work, and a careful plan of reduction, he was able to keep his observations up to date, and published them annually with a punctuality which astonished his contemporaries. Before long a mural circle was installed, and regular observations were instituted with it in 1833. In the same year the Duke of Northumberland presented the Cambridge observatory with a fine object-glass of 12-inch aperture, which was mounted according to Airy&#x27;s designs and under his superintendence, although construction was not completed until after he moved to Greenwich in 1835.

Airy&#x27;s writings during this time are divided between mathematical physics and astronomy. The former are for the most part concerned with questions relating to the theory of light arising out of his professorial lectures, among which may be specially mentioned his paper &quot;On the Diffraction of an Object-Glass with Circular Aperture,&quot; and his enunciation of the complete theory of the rainbow. In 1831 the Copley Medal of the Royal Society was awarded to him for these researches. Of his astronomical writings during this period the most important are his investigation of the mass of Jupiter, his report to the British Association on the progress of astronomy during the 19th century, and his work &quot;On an Inequality of Long Period in the Motions of the Earth and Venus&quot;.

One of the sections of his able and instructive report was devoted to &quot;A Comparison of the Progress of Astronomy in England with that in other Countries&quot;, very much to the disadvantage of England. This reproach was subsequently to a great extent removed by his own labours.

====Mean density of the Earth====
One of the most remarkable of Airy&#x27;s researches was his determination of the mean density of the Earth. In 1826, the idea occurred to him of attacking this problem by means of pendulum experiments at the top and bottom of a deep mine. His first attempt, made in the same year, at the Dolcoath mine in Cornwall, failed in consequence of an accident to one of the pendulums. A second attempt in 1828 was defeated by a flooding of the mine, and many years elapsed before another opportunity presented itself. The experiments eventually took place at the Harton pit near South Shields in northern England in 1854. Their immediate result was to show that gravity at the bottom of the mine exceeded that at the top by 1/19286 of its amount, the depth being . From this he was led to the final value of Earth&#x27;s specific density of 6.566. This value, although considerably in excess of that previously found by different methods, was held by Airy, from the care and completeness with which the observations were carried out and discussed, to be &quot;entitled to compete with the others on, at least, equal terms.&quot; The currently accepted value for Earth&#x27;s density is 5.5153 g/cm3.

====Reference geoid====
In 1830, Airy calculated the lengths of the polar radius and equatorial radius of the earth using measurements taken in the UK. Although his measurements were superseded by more accurate radius figures (such as those used for GRS 80 and WGS84) his &quot;Airy geoid&quot; (strictly a reference ellipsoid, OSGB36) is still used by Great Britain&#x27;s Ordnance Survey for mapping of England, Scotland and Wales because it better fits the local sea level (about 80 cm below world average).

====Planetary inequalities====
Airy&#x27;s discovery of a new inequality in the motions of Venus and the Earth is in some respects his most remarkable achievement. In correcting the elements of Delambre&#x27;s solar tables he had been led to suspect an inequality overlooked by their constructor. The cause of this he did not long seek in vain; thirteen times the mean motion of Venus is so nearly equal to eight times that of Earth that the difference amounts to only a small fraction of Earth&#x27;s mean motion, and from the fact that the term depending on this difference, although very small in itself, receives in the integration of the differential equations a multiplier of about 2,200,000, Airy was led to infer the existence of a sensible inequality extending over 240 years (&quot;Phil. Trans.&quot; cxxii. 67). The investigation was probably the most laborious that had been made up to Airy&#x27;s time in planetary theory, and represented the first specific improvement in the solar tables effected in England since the establishment of the theory of gravity. In recognition of this work the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society was awarded to him in 1833 (he would win it again in 1846).

====Airy disk====
The resolution of optical devices is limited by diffraction. So even the most perfect lens can&#x27;t quite generate a point image at its focus, but instead there is a bright central pattern now called the Airy disk, surrounded by concentric rings comprising an Airy pattern. The size of the Airy disk depends on the light wavelength and the size of the aperture. John Herschel had previously described the phenomenon, but Airy was the first to explain it theoretically.

This was a key argument in refuting one of the last remaining arguments for absolute geocentrism: the giant star argument. Tycho Brahe and Giovanni Battista Riccioli pointed out that the lack of stellar parallax detectable at the time entailed that stars were a huge distance away. But the naked eye and the early telescopes with small apertures seemed to show that stars were disks of a certain size. This would imply that the stars were many times larger than the Sun (they were not aware of supergiant or hypergiant stars, but some were calculated to be even larger than the size of the whole universe estimated at the time). However, the disk appearances of the stars were spurious: they were not actually seeing stellar images, but Airy disks. With modern telescopes, even with those having the largest magnification, the images of almost all stars correctly appear as mere points of light.

====Astronomer Royal====

In June 1835 Airy was appointed Astronomer Royal in succession to John Pond, and began his long career at the national observatory which constitutes his chief title to fame. The condition of the observatory at the time of his appointment was such that Lord Auckland, the first Lord of the Admiralty, considered that &quot;it ought to be cleared out,&quot; while Airy admitted that &quot;it was in a queer state.&quot; With his usual energy he set to work at once to reorganise the whole management. He remodelled the volumes of observations, put the library on a proper footing, mounted the new (Sheepshanks) equatorial and organised a new magnetic observatory. In 1847 an altazimuth was erected, designed by Airy to enable observations of the moon to be made not only on the meridian, but whenever it might be visible. In 1848 Airy invented the reflex zenith tube to replace the zenith sector previously employed. At the end of 1850 the great transit circle of aperture and focal length was erected, and is still the principal instrument of its class at the observatory. The mounting in 1859 of an equatorial of aperture evoked the comment in his journal for that year, &quot;There is not now a single person employed or instrument used in the observatory which was there in Mr Pond&#x27;s time&quot;; and the transformation was completed by the inauguration of spectroscopic work in 1868 and of the photographic registration of sunspots in 1873.
The formidable undertaking of reducing the accumulated planetary observations made at Greenwich from 1750 to 1830 was already in progress under Airy&#x27;s supervision when he became Astronomer Royal. Shortly afterwards he undertook the further laborious task of reducing the enormous mass of observations of the moon made at Greenwich during the same period under the direction, successively, of James Bradley, Nathaniel Bliss, Nevil Maskelyne and John Pond, to defray the expense of which a large sum of money was allotted by the Treasury. As a result, no fewer than 8,000 lunar observations were rescued from oblivion, and were, in 1846, placed at the disposal of astronomers in such a form that they could be used directly for comparison with the theory and for the improvement of the tables of the moon&#x27;s motion.

For this work Airy received in 1848 a testimonial from the Royal Astronomical Society, and it at once led to the discovery by Peter Andreas Hansen of two new inequalities in the moon&#x27;s motion. After completing these reductions, Airy made inquiries, before engaging in any theoretical investigation in connection with them, whether any other mathematician was pursuing the subject, and learning that Hansen had taken it in hand under the patronage of the king of Denmark, but that, owing to the death of the king and the consequent lack of funds, there was danger of his being compelled to abandon it, he applied to the admiralty on Hansen&#x27;s behalf for the necessary sum. His request was immediately granted, and thus it came about that Hansen&#x27;s famous &quot;Tables de la Lune&quot; were dedicated to &quot;La Haute Amirauté de sa Majesté la Reine de la Grande Bretagne et d&#x27;Irlande&quot;.

In 1851 Airy established a new Prime Meridian at Greenwich. This line, the fourth &quot;Greenwich Meridian&quot;, became the definitive internationally recognised line in 1884. It was superseded by the IERS Reference Meridian in 1984, which runs approximately 102 metres to the east.

====Search for Neptune====
In June 1846, Airy started corresponding with French astronomer Urbain Le Verrier over the latter&#x27;s prediction that irregularities in the motion of Uranus were due to a so-far unobserved body. Aware that Cambridge Astronomer John Couch Adams had suggested that he had made similar predictions, on 9 July Airy urged James Challis to undertake a systematic search in the hope of securing the triumph of discovery for Britain. Ultimately, a rival search in Berlin by Johann Gottfried Galle, instigated by Le Verrier, won the race for priority. Though Airy was &quot;abused most savagely both by English and French&quot; for his failure to act on Adams&#x27;s suggestions more promptly, there have also been claims that Adams&#x27;s communications had been vague and dilatory and further that the search for a new planet was not the responsibility of the Astronomer Royal.

====Ether drag test====

Using a water-filled telescope, in 1871 Airy looked for a change in stellar aberration through the refracting water due to the aether drag hypothesis. Like all other attempts to detect aether drift or drag, Airy obtained a negative result. George Biddell Airy did not set out to discover either a stationary or moving aether. Nor did he set out to prove that the earth itself was either stationary or moving. A simple reading of his paper confirms those facts. Airy&#x27;s experiment was motivated exclusively by what he describes as a discussion in Continental publications (to which he refers in the opening paragraph of his paper) concerning light undergoing a relative increase in refraction upon traversing a refracting medium that has a translational velocity. The hypothesis of refractional increase with refracting medium motion was proposed by Fresnel2,3 in 1818 and experimentally confirmed by Fizeau4 in 1851. That confirmation has been repeated and stands today despite the unpopularity of Fresnel&#x27;s theoretical explanation of partial aether entrainment being responsible for the phenomenon.

====Lunar theory====
In 1872 Airy conceived the idea of treating the lunar theory in a new way, and at the age of seventy-one he embarked on the prodigious toil which this scheme entailed. A general description of his method will be found in the &quot;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot;, vol. xxxiv, No. 3. It consisted essentially in the adoption of Charles-Eugène Delaunay&#x27;s final numerical expressions for longitude, latitude, and parallax, with a symbolic term attached to each number, the value of which was to be determined by substitution in the equations of motion.

In this mode of treating the question the order of the terms is numerical, and though the amount of labour is such as might well have deterred a younger man, yet the details were easy, and a great part of it might be entrusted to &quot;a mere computer&quot;.

The work was published in 1886, when its author was eighty-five years of age. For some little time previously he had been harassed by a suspicion that certain errors had crept into the computations, and accordingly he addressed himself to the task of revision. But his powers were no longer what they had been, and he was never able to examine sufficiently into the matter. In 1890 he tells us how a grievous error had been committed in one of the first steps, and pathetically adds, &quot;My spirit in the work was broken, and I have never heartily proceeded with it since.&quot;

====Engineering mechanics====

=====Stress function method=====
In 1862, Airy presented a new technique to determine the strain and stress field within a beam. This technique, sometimes called the , can be used to find solutions to many two-dimensional problems in solid mechanics (see ). For example, it was used by H. M. Westergaard to determine the stress and strain field around a crack tip and thereby this method contributed to the development of fracture mechanics.

=====Tay Bridge disaster=====
Airy was consulted about wind speeds and pressures likely to be encountered on the proposed Forth suspension bridge being designed by Thomas Bouch for the North British Railway in the late 1870s. He thought that pressures no greater than about could be expected, a comment Bouch took to mean also applied to the first Tay railway bridge then being built. Much greater pressures, however, can be expected in severe storms. Airy was called to give evidence before the Official Inquiry into the Tay Bridge disaster, and was criticised for his advice. However, little was known about the problems of wind resistance of large structures, and a Royal Commission on Wind Pressure was asked to conduct research into the problem.

====Controversy====

Airy was described in his obituary published by the Royal Society as being &quot;a tough adversary&quot; and stories of various disagreements and conflicts with other scientists survive. Francis Ronalds discovered Airy to be his foe while he was inaugural Honorary Director of the Kew Observatory, which Airy considered to be a competitor to Greenwich. Other well documented conflicts were with Charles Babbage and Sir James South.

===Private life===
In July 1824, Airy met Richarda Smith (1804–1875), &quot;a great beauty&quot;, on a walking tour of Derbyshire. He later wrote, &quot;Our eyes met ... and my fate was sealed ... I felt irresistibly that we must be united,&quot; and Airy proposed two days later. Richarda&#x27;s father, the Revd Richard Smith, felt that Airy lacked the financial resources to marry his daughter. Only in 1830, with Airy established in his Cambridge position, was permission for the marriage granted.
The Airys had nine children, the first three of whom died young.

*Elizabeth Airy (born 1833) died of consumption (tuberculosis) in 1852.
*The eldest child to survive to adulthood was Wilfrid (1836–1925), who designed and engineered &quot;Colonel&quot; George Tomline&#x27;s Orwell Park Observatory. Wilfrid&#x27;s daughter was the artist Anna Airy. Anna&#x27;s mother died shortly after she was born, and she was raised by her maiden aunts Christabel and Annot (see below).
*George Airy&#x27;s son Hubert Airy (1838–1903) was a doctor, and a pioneer in the study of migraine. Airy himself suffered from this condition.
*The Airys&#x27; eldest daughter, Hilda (1840–1916), married the mathematician Edward Routh in 1864.
*Christabel (1842–1917) died unmarried, as did the next sister Annot (1843–1924).
*The Airys youngest child was Osmund (1845–1929).

Airy was knighted on 17 June 1872.

Airy retired in 1881, living with his two unmarried daughters at Croom&#x27;s Hill near Greenwich. In 1891, he suffered a fall and an internal injury. He survived the consequential surgery only a few days. His wealth at death was £27,713, equivalent to £3,746,548.49 in 2021. Airy and his wife and three pre-deceased children are buried at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Playford, Suffolk. A cottage owned by Airy still stands, adjacent to the church and now in private hands.

Sir Patrick Moore asserted in his autobiography that the ghost of Airy has been seen haunting the Royal Greenwich Observatory after nightfall. (page 178)

<text>A jack-o&#x27;-lantern (or jack o&#x27;lantern) is a carved lantern, most commonly made from a pumpkin, or formerly a root vegetable such as a mangelwurzel, rutabaga or turnip. Jack-o&#x27;-lanterns are associated with the Halloween holiday. Its name comes from the phenomenon of strange lights flickering over peat bogs, called &quot;jack-o&#x27;-lanterns&quot; (also known as &quot;will-o&#x27;-the-wisps&quot;). It is suggested that the name also has ties to the Irish legend of Stingy Jack, a drunkard who bargains with Satan and is doomed to roam the Earth with only a hollowed turnip to light his way.

Jack-o&#x27;-lanterns carved from pumpkins are a yearly Halloween tradition that developed in the United States when Irish, Cornish, Scottish and other Celtic influenced immigrants brought their root vegetable carving traditions with them. It is common to see jack-o&#x27;-lanterns used as external and interior decorations prior to and on Halloween.

To make a jack-o&#x27;-lantern, the top of a pumpkin is cut off to form a lid, the inside flesh is scooped out, and an image—usually a &quot;scary&quot; or &quot;funny&quot; face—is carved out of the rind exposing the hollow interior. A light source, traditionally a candle flame or tealight, is placed within before the lid is closed. Artificial jack-o&#x27;-lanterns with electric lights are also marketed.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;jack-o&#x27;-lantern&quot; was originally used to describe the visual phenomenon &quot;ignis fatuus&quot; (lit., &quot;foolish fire&quot;) known as a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp in English folklore. Used especially in East England, its earliest known use dates to the 1660s. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;) records use of the term in Britain from 1658 in reference to &quot;ignis fatuus&quot;, and from 1663 to 1704 in reference to a man with a lantern or to a night watchman. The &quot;OED&quot; gives 1837 as the earliest date for when the term was used to refer to a lantern carved from a turnip or pumpkin. 
==History==
===Origin===
The carving of vegetables has been a common practice in many parts of the world. It is believed that the custom of making jack-o&#x27;-lanterns at Halloween time began in Ireland and Britain. In the 19th century, &quot;turnips or mangel wurzels, hollowed out to act as lanterns and often carved with grotesque faces,&quot; were used on Halloween in parts of England, Ireland, Wales and the Scottish Highlands. In Gaelic-speaking regions, Halloween was also the festival of Samhain and was seen as a time when supernatural beings (the ) walked the earth. In Wales such nights were known as Ysbrydnosau (spirit nights), with Calan Gaeaf being the one which occurred on the night of 31 October. Jack-o&#x27;-lanterns were also made at Halloween time in Somerset, England (see Punkie Night) during the 19th century.

By those who made them, the lanterns were said to represent either spirits or supernatural beings, or were used to ward off evil spirits. For example, sometimes they were used by Halloween participants to frighten people, and sometimes they were set on windowsills to keep harmful spirits out of one&#x27;s home. It has also been suggested that the jack-o&#x27;-lanterns originally represented Christian souls in purgatory, as Halloween is the eve of All Saints&#x27; Day (1 November)/All Souls&#x27; Day (2 November).

On January 16, 1836, the &quot;Dublin Penny Journal&quot; published a long story on the legend of &quot;Jack-o&#x27;-the-Lantern&quot;, although this does not mention the lantern being carved from a vegetable. In 1837, the &quot;Limerick Chronicle&quot; refers to a local pub holding a carved gourd competition and presenting a prize to &quot;the best crown of Jack McLantern&quot;. The term &quot;McLantern&quot; also appears in an 1841 publication of the same paper.

There is also evidence that turnips were used to carve what was called a &quot;Hoberdy&#x27;s Lantern&quot; in Worcestershire, England, at the end of the 18th century. The folklorist Jabez Allies outlines other derivations of the name, &quot;Hobany&#x27;s&quot;, which is most likely derived from &quot;Hob and his&quot;, with other variations including &quot;Hob-o&#x27;-Lantern&quot;, &quot;Hobbedy&#x27;s Lantern&quot; and &quot;Hobbady-lantern&quot;.

===In North America===

The application of the term to carved pumpkins in American English is first seen in 1837.

 In the United States and Canada, the carved pumpkin was first associated with the harvest season in general before it became a symbol of Halloween. In 1895, an article on Thanksgiving entertaining recommended giving a lit jack-o&#x27;-lantern as a child&#x27;s prize in Thanksgiving games. The poet John Greenleaf Whittier, who was born in Massachusetts in 1807, wrote the poem &quot;The Pumpkin&quot; (1850), which mentions Thanksgiving but not Halloween:Oh!—fruit loved of boyhood!—the old days recalling,

When wood-grapes were purpling and brown nuts were falling!
When wild, ugly faces we carved in its skin,

Glaring out through the dark with a candle within!

The carved pumpkin lantern&#x27;s association with Halloween is recorded in the 1 November 1866 edition of the &quot;Daily News&quot; (Kingston, Ontario):
In 1879&#x27;s &quot;Funny Nursery Rhymes&quot;, a poem admonishes children to avoid being similar to untrustworthy &quot;Master Jack o&#x27; Lantern,&quot; described as a &quot;wicked, deceiving boy&quot; similar to a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp who &quot;dances, and jumps, and gambols.&quot; He is humorously illustrated as a personification of a lantern.

An 1885 article &quot;Halloween Sports and Customs&quot; contrasts the American jack-o&#x27;-lantern custom with the British bonfire custom:
Adaptations of Washington Irving&#x27;s short story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1820) often show the Headless Horseman with a jack-o&#x27;-lantern in place of his severed head. In the original story, a shattered pumpkin is discovered next to Ichabod Crane&#x27;s abandoned hat on the morning after Crane&#x27;s supposed encounter with the Horseman, but the story does not reference jack-o&#x27;-lanterns or Halloween.

===Folklore===

The story of the jack-o&#x27;-lantern comes in many forms and is similar to the story of Will-o&#x27;-the-wisp retold in different forms across Western Europe, including, Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden. In Switzerland, children will leave bowls of milk or cream out for mythical house spirits called Jack o&#x27; the bowl.
An old Irish folk tale from the mid-18th century tells of Stingy Jack, a lazy yet shrewd blacksmith who uses a cross to trap Satan.
One story says that Jack tricked Satan into climbing an apple tree, and once he was up there, Jack quickly placed crosses around the trunk or carved a cross into the bark, so that Satan could not get down.

Another version of the story says that Jack was getting chased by some villagers from whom he had stolen. He then met Satan, who claimed it was time for him to die. However, the thief stalled his death by tempting Satan with a chance to bedevil the church-going villagers chasing him. Jack told Satan to turn into a coin with which he would pay for the stolen goods (Satan could take on any shape he wanted); later, when the coin (Satan) disappeared, the Christian villagers would fight over who had stolen it. The Devil agreed to this plan. He turned himself into a silver coin and jumped into Jack&#x27;s wallet, only to find himself next to a cross Jack had also picked up in the village. Jack closed the wallet tight, and the cross stripped the Devil of his powers; and so he was trapped.

In both folktales, Jack lets Satan go only after he agrees to never take his soul. Many years later, the thief died, as all living things do. Of course, Jack&#x27;s life had been too sinful for him to go to Heaven; however, Satan had promised not to take his soul, and so he was barred from Hell as well. Jack now had nowhere to go. He asked how he would see where to go, as he had no light, and Satan mockingly tossed him a burning coal, to light his way. Jack carved out one of his turnips (which were his favorite food), put the coal inside it, and began endlessly wandering the Earth for a resting place. He became known as &quot;Jack of the Lantern&quot;, or jack o&#x27;lantern.

Cornish folklorist Dr. Thomas Quiller Couch (d. 1884) recorded the use of the term in a rhyme used in Polperro, Cornwall, in conjunction with Joan the Wad, the Cornish version of Will-o&#x27;-the-wisp. The people of Polperro regarded them both as pixies. The rhyme goes:

&lt;poem&gt;Jack o&#x27; the lantern! Joan the wad,
Who tickled the maid and made her mad
Light me home, the weather&#x27;s bad.&lt;/poem&gt;

Jack-o-lanterns were also a way of protecting one&#x27;s home against the undead. Superstitious people used them specifically to ward off vampires. They thought this because it was said that the jack-o-lantern&#x27;s light was a way of identifying vampires who, once their identity was known, would give up their hunt for you.

==Pumpkin craft==

Sections of the pumpkin or turnip are cut out to make holes, often depicting a face, which may be either cheerful, scary, or comical. Jack-o&#x27;-lanterns are typically made from Connecticut field pumpkins, which are described as &quot;the original commercial jack-o&#x27;-lantern pumpkin&quot;.

==World records==
For a long time, Keene, New Hampshire, held the world record for most jack-o&#x27;-lanterns carved and lit in one place. The Life is Good Company teamed up with Camp Sunshine, a camp for children with life-threatening illnesses and their families, to break the record. A record was set on October 21, 2006, when 30,128 jack-o&#x27;-lanterns were simultaneously lit on Boston Common in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. Highwood, Illinois, tried to set the record on October 31, 2011, with an unofficial count of 30,919 but did not follow the Guinness regulations, so the achievement did not count.

On October 19, 2013, Keene broke the Boston record and reclaimed the world record for most lit jack-o&#x27;-lanterns on display (30,581). The town has broken the record eight times since the original attempt.

<text>Peter Andreas Hansen (born 8 December 1795, Tønder, Schleswig, Denmark; died 28 March 1874, Gotha, Thuringia, Germany) was a Danish-born German astronomer.

==Biography==
The son of a goldsmith, Hansen learned the trade of a watchmaker at Flensburg, and exercised it at Berlin and Tønder, 1818–1820. He had, however, long been a student of science; and Dr Dircks, a physician practising at Tønder, prevailed with his father to send him in 1820 to Copenhagen, where he won the patronage of H.C. Schumacher and attracted the personal notice of King Frederick VI. The Danish survey was then in progress, and he acted as Schumacher&#x27;s assistant in work connected with it, chiefly at the new observatory of Altona, from 1821 to 1825.

Thence he passed on to Gotha as director of the Gotha Observatory; nor could he be tempted to relinquish the post by successive invitations to replace F.G.W. Struve at Dorpat in 1829, Friedrich Wilhelm August Argelander at Helsinki in 1837, and F. W. Bessel at Königsberg in 1847. The problems of gravitational astronomy engaged the chief part of Hansen&#x27;s attention. A research into the mutual perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn secured for him the prize of the Berlin Academy in 1830, and a memoir on cometary disturbances was crowned by the Paris Academy in 1850.

In 1838 he published a revision of the lunar theory, entitled &quot;Fundamenta nova investigationis&quot;, &amp;c., and the improved &quot;Tables of the Moon&quot; (&quot;Hansen&#x27;s Lunar Tables&quot;) based upon it were printed in 1857, at the expense of the British government, their merit being further recognized by a grant of £1000, and by their adoption in the &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot; as from the issue for the year 1862, and other Ephemerides. A theoretical discussion of the disturbances embodied in them (long familiarly known to lunar experts as the &quot;Darlegung&quot;) appeared in the &quot;Abhandlungen&quot; of the Saxon Academy of Sciences in 1862 to 1864. At the time of publication of Hansen&#x27;s Tables of the Moon in 1857, astronomers generally believed that the lunar theory was at last complete; but within about a decade, it was noticed, and shown by Simon Newcomb, that the optimism had been unfounded: deviations between computed and observed positions began to grow at a rate showing that further refinement was necessary. For some years Hansen&#x27;s theory continued to be used with Newcomb&#x27;s corrections (from the &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot;&#x27;s issue for 1883), but it was eventually (as from 1923) superseded by E W Brown&#x27;s theory.

Hansen twice visited Britain and was twice (in 1842 and 1860) the recipient of the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. He communicated to that society in 1847 an able paper on a long-period lunar inequality (&quot;Memoirs Roy. Astr. Society&quot;, xvi. 465), and in 1854 one on the Moon&#x27;s figure, advocating the mistaken hypothesis of its deformation by a huge elevation directed towards the Earth (ib. xxiv. 29). He was awarded the Copley Medal by the Royal Society in 1850, and his &quot;Solar Tables&quot;, compiled with the assistance of Christian Olufsen, appeared in 1854. Hansen gave in 1854 the first intimation that the accepted distance of the sun was too great by some millions of miles (&quot;Month. Notices Roy. Astr. Soc.&quot; xv. 9), the error of J.F. Encke&#x27;s result having been rendered evident through his investigation of a lunar inequality. In 1865, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

He died on 28 March 1874, at the new observatory in the town of Gotha, erected under his care in 1857.

Minor planet 4775 Hansen is named after him.

<text>Prof Heinrich Christian Schumacher FRS(For) FRSE (3 September 1780 – 28 December 1850) was a German-Danish astronomer and mathematician.

==Biography==

Schumacher was born at Bramstedt, in Holstein, near the German/Danish border. He was educated at Altona Gymnasium on the outskirts of Hamburg. He studied in Germany at Kiel, Jena, and Göttingen Universities as well as Copenhagen. He received a doctorate from Dorpat University in Russian Empire in 1807.

From 1808, he was adjunct professor of astronomy in Copenhagen. He directed the Mannheim observatory from 1813 to 1815, and then in 1815 was appointed Professor of Astronomy in Copenhagen and Director of the Observatory.

From 1817 he directed the triangulation of Holstein, to which a few years later was added a complete geodetic survey of Denmark (finished after his death). For the sake of the survey, Schumacher established the Altona Observatory at Altona, and resided there permanently. He cooperated with Carl Friedrich Gauss for the baseline measurement (Braak Base Line) in the village Braak near Hamburg in 1820.

He was elected a Foreign Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1821, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1822.

Schumacher was chiefly occupied with the publication of &quot;Ephemerides&quot; (11 parts, 1822–1832) and of the journal &quot;Astronomische Nachrichten&quot; (founded by himself in 1821 and still being published), of which he edited thirty-one volumes. In 1827 he was elected member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and in 1829 he won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. Schumacher was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1823 and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1834. His portrait now hangs in the Development Office of the Royal Society.

He died in Altona on 28 December 1850. He was buried in the Heilig Geist Kirchhof (Holy Ghost Church) in Altona. The site is now marked by a stone memorial.

==Family==

In 1812 he married Christine Madelaine Schoon.

Their son, Richard Schumacher (1827–1902), was his assistant from 1844 to 1850 at the conservatory at Altona. Having become assistant to Carlos Guillermo Moesta (1825–1884), director of the observatory at Santiago, in 1859, he was associated with the Chilean geodesic survey in 1864. Returning in 1869, he was appointed assistant astronomer at Altona in 1873, and afterwards at Kiel.

Schumacher&#x27;s nephew, Christian Andreas Schumacher (1810–1854), was associated with the geodetic survey of Denmark from 1833 to 1838, and afterwards (1844–1845) improved the observatory at Pulkowa.

==Recognition==
In 1935 the Moon crater Schumacher was named in his honour.

<text>Ryland Peter Cooder (born March 15, 1947) is an American musician, songwriter, film score composer, record producer, and writer. He is a multi-instrumentalist but is best known for his slide guitar work, his interest in traditional music, and his collaborations with traditional musicians from many countries.

Cooder&#x27;s solo work draws upon many genres. He has played with John Lee Hooker, Captain Beefheart, Taj Mahal, Gordon Lightfoot, Ali Farka Touré, Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, Neil Young, Randy Newman, Linda Ronstadt, Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, David Lindley, the Chieftains, Warren Zevon, Manuel Galbán, the Doobie Brothers, Little Feat, and Carla Olson and the Textones (on record and film). He formed the band Little Village, and produced the album &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; (1997), which became a worldwide hit; Wim Wenders directed the documentary film of the same name (1999), which was nominated for an Academy Award in 2000.

Cooder was ranked at No. 8 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2003 list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;, while a 2010 list by Gibson Guitar Corporation placed him at No. 32. In 2011, he published a collection of short stories called &quot;Los Angeles Stories&quot;.

==Early life==
Ryland Peter Cooder was born in Los Angeles, California, on March 15, 1947, the son of Emma Casaroli and Bill Cooder. His mother was of Italian descent. 

He was raised in Santa Monica, California, and graduated from Santa Monica High School in 1964. During the 1960s he briefly attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon. He began playing the guitar when he was three years old. 

Aged four, he accidentally stuck a knife in his left eye; he has sported a glass eye ever since.

==Career==

=== 1960s ===
Cooder performed as part of a pickup trio with Bill Monroe and Doc Watson, in which he played banjo. The trio was not successful, but reflecting his early exposure to the instrument, Cooder subsequently applied banjo tunings and the three finger roll to guitar.

Cooder first attracted attention playing with Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band, notably on the 1967 album &quot;Safe as Milk&quot;, after previously having worked with Taj Mahal and Ed Cassidy in the Rising Sons. At a vital &quot;warm-up&quot; performance at the Mt. Tamalpais Festival (June 10–11, 1967) shortly before the scheduled Monterey Pop Festival (June 16–18, 1967), the band began to play &quot;Electricity&quot; and Don Van Vliet froze, straightened his tie, then walked off the stage and landed on manager Bob Krasnow. He later claimed he had seen a girl in the audience turn into a fish, with bubbles coming from her mouth. This aborted any opportunity for breakthrough success at Monterey, for Cooder immediately decided he could no longer work with Van Vliet, effectively quitting both the event and the band on the spot. Cooder also played with Randy Newman, including on &quot;12 Songs&quot;. Van Dyke Parks worked with Newman and Cooder during the 1960s. Parks arranged Cooder&#x27;s &quot;One Meatball&quot; according to Parks&#x27; 1984 interview with Bob Claster.

Cooder was a session musician on various recording sessions with the Rolling Stones in 1968 and 1969, and his contributions appear on the albums &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; (Yank Rachell-style mandolin on &quot;Love in Vain&quot;), and &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;, on which he contributed the slide guitar on &quot;Sister Morphine&quot;. During this period, Cooder joined with Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman, and longtime Rolling Stones sideman Nicky Hopkins to record &quot;Jamming with Edward!&quot;. Cooder also played slide guitar for the 1970 film soundtrack &quot;Performance&quot;, which contained Jagger&#x27;s first solo single, &quot;Memo from Turner&quot;. The 1975 compilation album &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; features an uncredited Cooder contribution to Bill Wyman&#x27;s &quot;Downtown Suzie&quot;.

Cooder also collaborated with Lowell George of Little Feat, playing bottleneck guitar on the original version of &quot;Willin&#x27;&quot;. He also played bottleneck guitar and mandolin on two tracks on the Gordon Lightfoot album &quot;Sit Down Young Stranger&quot; (later re-titled &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot;), recorded in late 1969 and released in early 1970.

===1970s===
Throughout the 1970s, Cooder released a series of Warner Bros. Records albums that showcased his guitar work, initially on the Reprise Records label, before being reassigned to the main Warners label along with many of Reprise&#x27;s artists when the company retired the imprint. Cooder explored bygone musical genres and found old-time recordings which he then personalized and updated. Thus, on his breakthrough album, &quot;Into the Purple Valley&quot;, he chose unusual instrumentations and arrangements of blues, gospel, calypso, and country songs (giving a tempo change to the cowboy ballad &quot;Billy the Kid&quot;). The album opened with the song &quot;How Can You Keep on Moving (Unless You Migrate Too)&quot; by Agnes &quot;Sis&quot; Cunningham about the Okies who were not welcomed when they migrated west to escape the Dust Bowl in the 1930s – to which Cooder gave a rousing-yet-satirical march accompaniment. In 1970 he collaborated with Ron Nagle and performed on his &quot;Bad Rice&quot; album released on Warner Brothers. His later 1970s albums (with the exception of &quot;Jazz&quot;, which explored ragtime/vaudeville) do not fall under a single genre description, but his self-titled first album could be described as blues; &quot;Into the Purple Valley&quot;, &quot;Boomer&#x27;s Story&quot;, and &quot;Paradise and Lunch&quot; as folk and blues; &quot;Chicken Skin Music&quot; and &quot;Showtime&quot; as a mix of Tex-Mex and Hawaiian; &quot;Bop Till You Drop&quot; as 1950s R&amp;B; and &quot;Borderline&quot; and &quot;Get Rhythm&quot; as rock-based. His 1979 album &quot;Bop Till You Drop&quot; was the first popular music album released that was recorded digitally, using the early 3M digital mastering recorder. It yielded his biggest hit, an R&amp;B cover version of Elvis Presley&#x27;s 1960s recording &quot;Little Sister&quot;.

Cooder is credited on Van Morrison&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Into the Music&quot;, for slide guitar on the song &quot;Full Force Gale&quot;. He also played guitar on Judy Collins&#x27; 1970 concert tour, and is featured on &quot;Living&quot;, the 1971 live album recorded during that tour. He also learned from and performed with Gabby Pahinui and &quot;Atta&quot; Isaacs in Hawaii during the Hawaiian Renaissance of the early 1970s. He is also credited for guitars on several 1971 recordings by Nancy Sinatra that were produced by Andy Wickman and Lenny Waronker – &quot;Is Anybody Goin&#x27; To San Antone&quot;, &quot;Hook &amp; Ladder&quot;, and &quot;Glory Road&quot;. Cooder is credited as a mandolin player on Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot; album in 1972.

===1980s===
Cooder has worked as a studio musician and has also scored many film soundtracks including the Wim Wenders film &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984). Cooder based this soundtrack and title song &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; on Blind Willie Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dark Was the Night (Cold Was the Ground)&quot;, which he described as &quot;the most soulful, transcendent piece in all American music&quot;. Musician Dave Grohl has declared Cooder&#x27;s score for &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; one of his favorite albums. In 2018 Cooder told BBC Radio 4 listeners: &quot;[Wenders] did a very good job at capturing the ambiance out there in the desert, just letting the microphones and the nagra machine roll and get tones and sound from the desert itself, which I discovered was E♭, was in the key of E♭ – that&#x27;s the wind, you know, was nice. So we tuned everything to E♭.&quot;

&quot;Dark Was the Night (Cold Was the Ground)&quot; was also the basis for Cooder&#x27;s song &quot;Powis Square&quot; for the movie &quot;Performance&quot;. His other film work includes Walter Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Long Riders&quot; (1980), &quot;Southern Comfort&quot; (1981), &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; (1984), &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; (1985), &quot;Johnny Handsome&quot;, &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; (1996), Hill&#x27;s &quot;Trespass&quot; (1992) and Mike Nichols&#x27; &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998). Cooder, along with Arlen Roth, dubbed all slide and regular blues guitar parts in the 1986 film &quot;Crossroads&quot;, a take on blues legend Robert Johnson. In 1988, Cooder produced the album by his longtime backing vocalists Bobby King and Terry Evans on Rounder Records titled &quot;Live and Let Live&quot;. He contributed his slide guitar work to every track. He also plays extensively on their 1990 self-produced Rounder release &quot;Rhythm, Blues, Soul &amp; Grooves&quot;. Cooder&#x27;s music also appeared on two episodes of the television program &quot;Tales From the Crypt&quot;: &quot;The Man Who Was Death&quot; and &quot;The Thing From the Grave&quot;.

In 1984, Cooder played on two songs on the debut album by Carla Olson &amp; the Textones, &quot;Midnight Mission&quot; – &quot;Carla&#x27;s Number One is to Survive&quot; and the previously unreleased Bob Dylan song &quot;Clean Cut Kid&quot;. Shortly thereafter he was writing and recording the music for the film &quot;Blue City&quot; and asked the band to appear in the film performing. (He took them to the studio and produced &quot;You Can Run&quot; which he also played on.)

In 1985, Cooder was a guest artist on the song &quot;Rough Edges&quot; from Kim Carnes&#x27; album &quot;Barking at Airplanes&quot;. Kim named her son Ry as a tribute to Ry Cooder.

Also in 1988, Cooder produced and featured in the Les Blank-directed concert documentary film &quot;Ry Cooder &amp; The Moula Banda Rhythm Aces: Let&#x27;s Have a Ball&quot; where he plays in collaboration with a selection of musicians famous in their various musical fields. The following year, he played a janitor in the Jim Henson series &quot;The Ghost of Faffner Hall&quot;, in the episode &quot;Music Is More Than Technique&quot;.

===1990s===
In the early 1990s, Cooder collaborated on two world music &quot;crossover&quot; albums, which blended the traditional American musical genres that Cooder has championed throughout his career with the contemporary improvised music of India and Africa. For &quot;A Meeting by the River&quot; (1993), which also featured his son Joachim Cooder on percussion, he teamed with Hindustani classical musician V.M. Bhatt, a virtuoso of the Mohan Veena (a modified 20-string archtop guitar of Bhatt&#x27;s own invention) and Sukhvinder Singh Namdhari also known as Pinky Tabla Player.

In 1993 he teamed up with multi-instrumentalist Ali Farka Touré from Mali to record the album &quot;Talking Timbuktu&quot;, which he also produced. The album, released in 1994, also featured longtime Cooder collaborator Jim Keltner on drums, veteran blues guitarist Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown, jazz bassist John Patitucci and African percussionists and musicians including Hamma Sankare and Oumar Toure. Both albums won the Grammy Award for Best World Music Album in 1994 and 1995 respectively. Cooder also worked with Tuvan throat singers for the score to the 1993 film &quot;&quot;.

In 1995 he performed in &quot;The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True&quot;, a musical performance of the popular story at the Lincoln Center in New York to benefit the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund. The performance was originally broadcast on both TBS and TNT. It was issued on CD and video in 1996.

In the late 1990s Cooder played a significant role in the increased appreciation of traditional Cuban music, due to his collaboration as producer of the &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; (1997) recording, which became a worldwide hit and revived the careers of some of the greatest surviving exponents of 20th century Cuban music. Wim Wenders, who had previously directed 1984&#x27;s &quot;Paris, Texas&quot;, directed a documentary film of the musicians involved, &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; (1999), which was nominated for an Academy Award in 2000. The enterprise cost him a $25,000 fine for violating the United States embargo against Cuba.

===2000s===
Cooder&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Chávez Ravine&quot; was touted by his record label as being &quot;a post-World War II-era American narrative of &#x27;cool cats&#x27;, radios, UFO sightings, J. Edgar Hoover, red scares, and baseball&quot;. The record is a tribute to the long-gone Los Angeles Latino enclave known as Chávez Ravine. Using real and imagined historical characters, Cooder and friends created an album that recollects various aspects of the poor but vibrant hillside Chicano community that no longer exists. Cooder says, &quot;Here is some music for a place you don&#x27;t know, up a road you don&#x27;t go. Chávez Ravine, where the sidewalk ends.&quot; Drawing from the various musical strains of Los Angeles, including conjunto, R&amp;B, Latin pop, and jazz, Cooder and friends conjure the ghosts of Chávez Ravine and Los Angeles at mid-century. On this fifteen-track album, sung in Spanish and English, Cooder is joined by East L.A. legends like Chicano music patriarch Lalo Guerrero, Pachuco boogie king Don Tosti, Thee Midniters front man Little Willie G, and Ersi Arvizu, of The Sisters and El Chicano.

Cooder&#x27;s next record was released in 2007. Entitled &quot;My Name Is Buddy&quot;, it tells the story of Buddy Red Cat, who travels and sees the world in the company of his like-minded friends, Lefty Mouse and Rev. Tom Toad. The entire recording is a parable of the working class progressivism of the first half of the American twentieth century, and even has a song featuring executed unionist Joe Hill. &quot;My Name Is Buddy&quot; was accompanied by a booklet featuring a story and illustration (by Vincent Valdez) for each track, providing additional context to Buddy&#x27;s adventures.

Cooder produced and performed on an album for Mavis Staples entitled &quot;We&#x27;ll Never Turn Back&quot;, which was released on April 24, 2007. The concept album focused on Gospel songs of the civil rights movement and also included two new original songs by Cooder.

Cooder&#x27;s album &quot;I, Flathead&quot; was released on June 24, 2008. It is the completion of his California trilogy. Based on the drag racing culture of the early 1960s, the album is set on the desert salt flats in southern California. The disc was also released as a deluxe edition with stories written by Cooder to accompany the music.

In late 2009, Cooder toured Japan, New Zealand, and Australia with Nick Lowe, performing some of Lowe&#x27;s songs and a selection of Cooder&#x27;s own material, mainly from the 1970s. Joaquim Cooder (Ry&#x27;s son) provided percussion, and Juliette Commagere and Alex Lilly contributed backing vocals.

The song &quot;Diaraby&quot;, which Cooder recorded with Ali Farka Touré, is used as the theme to &quot;The World&#x27;s&quot; Geo Quiz. &quot;The World&quot; is a radio show distributed by Public Radio International.

In 2009, Cooder performed in &quot;The People Speak&quot;, a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn&#x27;s &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;. Cooder performed with Bob Dylan and Van Dyke Parks on the documentary broadcast on December 13, 2009, on the History Channel. They played &quot;Do Re Mi&quot; and reportedly a couple of other Guthrie songs that were excluded from the final edit. He also traveled with the band Los Tigres del Norte and recorded the 2010 album &quot;San Patricio&quot; with the Chieftains, Lila Downs, Liam Neeson, Linda Ronstadt, Van Dyke Parks, Los Cenzontles, and Los Tigres.

===2010s===

In June 2010, responding to the passage of Arizona SB 1070, he released the single &quot;Quicksand&quot;, which tells the story of Mexicans attempting to emigrate to Arizona through the desert.
Cooder&#x27;s critically acclaimed new album &quot;Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down&quot;, released on August 30, 2011, contains politically charged songs such as &quot;No Banker Left Behind&quot; which was inspired by a Robert Scheer column.

In 2011, he published a collection of short stories called &quot;Los Angeles Stories&quot;, written about people living in Los Angeles in the 1940s and 1950s. The book&#x27;s characters are mostly talented or skilled, clever or hardworking people living in humble circumstances. With story titles such as &quot;La vida es un sueño&quot; and &quot;Kill me, por favor&quot;, the collection&#x27;s stories often have a Hispanic theme, and the book deals partially with Latinos living in Los Angeles during this time.

An &quot;American Songwriter&quot; article in 2012 suggested that Cooder&#x27;s recent string of solo albums have often taken on an allegorical, sociopolitical bent. Music journalist Evan Schlansky said that &quot;Cooder&#x27;s latest effort, &quot;Election Special&quot; (released August 21, 2012, on Nonesuch/Perro Verde) doesn&#x27;t mince words. It&#x27;s designed to send a message to the &#x27;deacons in the High Church of the Next Dollar&#x27;&quot;. The album was composed in support of the Democratic Party and President Barack Obama in the 2012 election.

On September 10, 2013, Cooder released &quot;Live in San Francisco&quot;, featuring the Corridos Famosos band, including Joachim Cooder on drums; Robert Francis on bass; vocalists Terry Evans, Arnold McCuller, and Juliette Commagere; Flaco Jiménez on accordion; and the Mexican brass band La Banda Juvenil. The album was recorded during a two-night run at Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, August 31 and September 1, 2011. It is Cooder&#x27;s first official live recording since &quot;Show Time&quot; in 1977 (which had also been recorded at Great American Music Hall).

In 2015, Cooder toured with Ricky Skaggs, Sharon White and other members of the Whites with their &quot;Music for The Good People&quot; show. The tour continued through into 2016.

On May 11, 2018, Cooder released his first solo album in six years entitled &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;. The subsequent tour featured opening performances by his son, Joachim, who also accompanied Cooder on drums.

In 2019, he toured with Rosanne Cash on a brief tour as a tribute to Johnny Cash called &quot;Cooder and Cash on Cash&quot;.

===2020s===
On April 22, 2022, Cooder and Taj Mahal released &quot;Get on Board: The Songs of Sonny Terry &amp; Brownie McGhee&quot;.

<text>Quincy Delight Jones Jr. (March 14, 1933 – November 3, 2024) was an American record producer, composer, arranger, conductor, trumpeter, and bandleader. Over the course of his seven-decade career, he received many accolades including 28 Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Tony Award as well as nominations for seven Academy Awards and four Golden Globe Awards.

Jones came to prominence in the 1950s as a jazz arranger and conductor before producing pop hit records for Lesley Gore in the early 1960s (including &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot;) and serving as an arranger and conductor for several collaborations between Frank Sinatra and the jazz artist Count Basie. Jones produced three of the most successful albums by Michael Jackson: &quot;Off the Wall&quot; (1979), &quot;Thriller&quot; (1982), and &quot;Bad&quot; (1987). In 1985, Jones produced and conducted the charity song &quot;We Are the World&quot;, which raised funds for victims of famine in Ethiopia.

Jones composed numerous film scores including for &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot; (1965), &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967), &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; (1967), &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (1969), &quot;The Wiz&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (1985). He won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series for the miniseries &quot;Roots&quot; (1977). He received a Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical as a producer for the revival of &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (2016).

Throughout his career he was the recipient of numerous honorary awards including the Grammy Legend Award in 1992, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1995, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2001, the National Medal of the Arts in 2011, the in 2014, and the Academy Honorary Award in June 2024. He was named one of the most influential jazz musicians of the 20th century by &quot;Time&quot;.

==Early life==
Quincy Delight Jones Jr. was born in the South Side of Chicago on March 14, 1933, the elder of two sons to Sara Frances (née Wells; 1904–1999), a bank officer and apartment complex manager, and Quincy Delight Jones (1895–1971), a semi-professional baseball player and carpenter from Charleston, South Carolina. Quincy Jr.&#x27;s paternal grandmother was an ex-slave from Louisville, and he later discovered that his paternal grandfather was Welsh.

Jones said, &quot;He had a baby with my great-grandmother [a slave], and my grandmother was born there [on a plantation in Kentucky]. We traced this all the way back to the Laniers, the same family as Tennessee Williams.&quot; Learning that the Lanier immigrant ancestors were French Huguenots who had court musicians among their ancestors, Jones attributed some of his musicianship to them.

For the 2006 PBS television program &quot;African American Lives&quot;, Jones had his DNA tested and genealogists researched his family history again. His DNA revealed he was mostly African, but also had 34% European ancestry on both sides of his family. Research showed that he had English, French, Italian, and Welsh ancestry through his father. His mother&#x27;s side was of West and Central African descent, specifically from the Tikar people of Cameroon. His mother also had European ancestry, including Lanier male ancestors who fought for the Confederacy, making him eligible for membership in the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Among his ancestors was Elizabeth Washington Lewis, a sister of president George Washington.

Jones&#x27;s family moved to Chicago during the Great Migration. Jones had a younger brother, Lloyd, who was an engineer for the Seattle television station KOMO-TV until his death in 1998. Jones was introduced to music by his mother who always sang religious songs, and next-door neighbor Lucy Jackson. When Jones was five or six, Jackson played stride piano next door, and he would listen through the walls. Jackson recalled that after he heard her one-day, she could not get him off her piano.

When Jones was young, his mother had a schizophrenic breakdown and was sent to a mental institution. His father divorced her and married Elvera Jones, who already had three children: Waymond, Theresa, and Katherine. Elvera and Quincy Sr. had three more children together: Jeanette, Margie, and Richard. The family moved to Sinclair Park, a segregated community in Bremerton, Washington, in 1943. Jones&#x27;s father took a wartime job at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

After the war, the family moved to Seattle, where Jones attended Garfield High School and developed his skills as a trumpeter and arranger. His classmates included Charles Taylor, who played saxophone and whose mother, Evelyn Bundy, was one of Seattle&#x27;s first society jazz bandleaders. Jones and Taylor began playing music together, and at the age of fourteen they played with a National Reserve band. Jones said he acquired more experience with music growing up in a smaller city because of the lack of competition.

Jones cited Ray Charles as an early inspiration for his own music career, noting that Charles overcame his blindness to achieve his musical goals. Jones credited his father&#x27;s sturdy work ethic with giving him the means to proceed, and his loving nature with holding the family together. Jones cited his father&#x27;s rhyming motto: &quot;Once a task is just begun, never leave until it&#x27;s done. Be the labor great or small, do it well or not at all.&quot;

Jones earned a scholarship to Seattle University in 1951. After one semester, he transferred to what is now the Berklee College of Music in Boston on another scholarship, where he played at Izzy Ort&#x27;s Bar &amp; Grille with Bunny Campbell and Preston Sandiford, whom he cited as important influences.

==Career==
=== 1953–1959: Career beginnings with jazz music ===

In 1953, at age 20, Jones traveled with jazz bandleader Lionel Hampton for a European tour of the Hampton orchestra. He said the tour changed his view of racism in the United States, &quot;It gave you some sense of perspective on past, present, and future. It took the myopic conflict between just black and white in the United States and put it on another level because you saw the turmoil between the Armenians and the Turks, and the Cypriots and the Greeks, and the Swedes and the Danes, and the Koreans and the Japanese. Everybody had these hassles, and you saw it was a basic part of human nature, these conflicts. It opened my soul; it opened my mind.&quot;

After leaving the Hampton band in 1954, Jones settled in New York, and started writing &quot;for anyone who would pay&quot;. In early 1956, he accepted a temporary job at CBS&#x27; &quot;&quot;Stage Show&quot;&quot; hosted by Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey that was broadcast live from Studio 50 in New York City (known today as the Ed Sullivan Theater). On January 28, February 4, 11 and 18, as well as on March 17 and 24, Jones played second trumpet in the studio band that supported 21-year-old Elvis Presley in his first six television appearances. Presley sang &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, which became his first No. 1 record and the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine Pop Record of the year. Soon after, as a trumpeter and musical director for Dizzy Gillespie, Jones went on tour of the Middle East and South America sponsored by the United States Information Agency. After returning, he signed a contract with ABC-Paramount and started his recording career as the leader of his band. In 1957, he moved to Paris, where he studied composition and theory with Nadia Boulanger and Olivier Messiaen and performed at the Paris Olympia. Jones became music director at Barclay, a French record company (and the licensee for Mercury in France).

In the 1950s, Jones toured Europe with several jazz orchestras. As musical director of Harold Arlen&#x27;s jazz musical &quot;Free and Easy&quot;, he took to the road again. With musicians from the Arlen show, he formed his big band, The Jones Boys, with eighteen musicians. The band included double bass player Eddie Jones and trumpeter Reunald Jones. None of the three were related. The band toured North America and Europe, and the concerts met enthusiastic audiences and sparkling reviews, but the earnings failed to support a band of this size. Poor budget planning resulted in an economic disaster. The band dissolved, leaving Jones in a financial crisis. &quot;We had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving. That&#x27;s when I discovered that there was , and there was the . If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.&quot; Irving Green, head of Mercury, helped Jones with a personal loan and a job as musical director of the company&#x27;s New York division. He worked with Doug Moody, founder of Mystic Records.

Jones first worked with Frank Sinatra in 1958 when invited by Princess Grace to arrange a benefit concert at the Monaco Sporting Club. Six years later, Sinatra hired him to arrange and conduct Sinatra&#x27;s second album with Count Basie, &quot;It Might as Well Be Swing&quot; (1964). Jones conducted and arranged Sinatra&#x27;s live album with the Basie Band, &quot;Sinatra at the Sands&quot; (1966). Jones was also the arranger/conductor when Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, and Johnny Carson performed with the Basie orchestra in June 1965 in St. Louis, Missouri, in a benefit for Dismas House. The fund-raiser was broadcast to movie theaters around the country and eventually released on VHS. Later that year, Jones was the arranger/conductor when Sinatra and Basie appeared on &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; TV variety show on October 16, 1965. Nineteen years later, Sinatra and Jones teamed up for the 1984 album &quot;L.A. Is My Lady&quot;. Jones said,

=== 1961–1977: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

In 1961, Jones was promoted and became the vice-president of Mercury, the first African American to hold the position. In the same year, at the invitation of director Sidney Lumet, he composed music for &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot; (1964). It was the first of his nearly 40 major motion picture scores. Following the success of &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot;, Jones left Mercury and moved to Los Angeles. After composing film scores for &quot;Mirage&quot; and &quot;The Slender Thread&quot; in 1965, he was in constant demand as a composer.

His film credits over the next seven years came to include &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot;, &quot;The Deadly Affair&quot;, &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot;, &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot;, &quot;Cactus Flower&quot;, &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot;, &quot;They Call Me Mister Tibbs!&quot;, &quot;The Anderson Tapes&quot;, &quot;$ (Dollars)&quot;, and &quot;The Getaway&quot;. He composed &quot;The Streetbeater&quot;, which became the theme music for the television sitcom &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, starring his close friend Redd Foxx, and the themes for other TV shows, including &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;Rebop&quot;, &quot;Banacek&quot;, &quot;The Bill Cosby Show&quot;, the opening episode of &quot;Roots&quot;, &quot;Mad TV&quot;, and the game show &quot;Now You See It&quot;.

In the 1960s, Jones worked as an arranger for Billy Eckstine, Ella Fitzgerald, Shirley Horn, Peggy Lee, Nana Mouskouri, Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, and Dinah Washington. His solo recordings included &quot;Walking in Space&quot;, &quot;Gula Matari&quot;, &quot;Smackwater Jack&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got It Bad Girl&quot;, &quot;Body Heat&quot;, &quot;Mellow Madness&quot;, and &quot;I Heard That!!&quot;

Jones&#x27;s 1962 tune &quot;Soul Bossa Nova&quot;, which originated on the &quot;Big Band Bossa Nova&quot; album, was later used as the theme for the 1997 spy comedy &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot;.

Jones produced all four million-selling singles for Lesley Gore during the early and mid-1960s, including &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot; (UK No. 8; US No. 1), its sequel &quot;Judy&#x27;s Turn to Cry&quot; (US No. 5), &quot;She&#x27;s a Fool&quot; (also a US No. 5) in 1963, and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&quot; (US No. 2 for four weeks in 1964). He continued to produce for Gore until 1966, including notable hits like &quot;That&#x27;s the Way Boys Are&quot; (US No. 12 in 1964), the Greenwich/Barry hits &quot;Look of Love&quot; (US No. 27 in 1965) and &quot;Maybe I Know&quot; (UK No. 20; US No. 14 in 1964), &quot;Sunshine, Lollipops And Rainbows&quot; (No. 13 in 1965), and &quot;My Town, My Guy And Me&quot; (No. 32 in 1965). In 1975, Jones founded Qwest Productions, for which he arranged and produced successful albums by Frank Sinatra and others. He also reunited with Lesley Gore that year, producing her critically acclaimed album &quot;Love Me By Name&quot;, released on A&amp;M Records.

=== 1978–1989: Exploration into pop music ===

In 1978, he produced the soundtrack for &quot;The Wiz&quot;, the musical adaptation of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, which starred Michael Jackson and Diana Ross. While working on &quot;The Wiz&quot;, Jackson asked Jones to recommend some producers for his upcoming solo album. Jones offered some names but eventually offered to produce the record himself. Jackson accepted and the resulting record, &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, sold about 20 million copies. This made Jones the most powerful record producer in the industry at that time. Jones and Jackson&#x27;s next collaboration, &quot;Thriller&quot;, sold 65 million copies and became the highest-selling album of all time. The rise of MTV and the advent of music videos as promotional tools also contributed to &quot;Thriller&quot;&#x27;s sales. Jones worked on Jackson&#x27;s album &quot;Bad&quot;, which sold 45 million copies, and was the last time they worked with each other. Audio interviews with Jones are included in the 2001 special editions of &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot;, and &quot;Bad&quot;.

His 1981 album &quot;The Dude&quot; yielded the hits &quot;Ai No Corrida&quot; (a remake of a song by Chaz Jankel), &quot;Just Once&quot;, and &quot;One Hundred Ways&quot;, both sung by James Ingram. Marking Jones&#x27;s debut as a film producer, 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Color Purple&quot; received 11 Oscar nominations that year, including one for Jones&#x27;s score. Jones, Thomas Newman, and Alan Silvestri are the only composers besides John Williams to have written scores for a Steven Spielberg-directed theatrical feature film. Additionally, through this picture, Jones is credited with introducing Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey to film audiences around the world.
After the 1985 American Music Awards ceremony, Jones used his influence to draw most of the major American recording artists of the day into a studio to record the song &quot;We Are the World&quot; to raise money for the victims of famine in Ethiopia. When people marveled at his ability to make the collaboration work, Jones explained that he had taped a sign on the entrance reading &quot;Check Your Ego at the Door&quot;. He was also quoted as saying, &quot;We don&#x27;t want to make a hunger record in tuxedos&quot;, requiring all participants to wear casual clothing in the studio. In 1986, Jones started off Qwest Entertainment to produce theatrical feature films, through Qwest Film and Television. He launched a home video label, Qwest Home Video, in order to manage the home video titles made by the studio. Qwest Entertainment continued to operate their pre-existing subsidiaries like Qwest Records, Quincy Jones Productions and Qwest Music Publishing.

=== 1990–2024: Established career ===
In 1990, Quincy Jones Productions joined with Time Warner to create Quincy Jones Entertainment (QJE). The company signed a 10-picture deal with Warner Bros. and a two-series deal with NBC Productions, now Universal Television. The television show &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; (Will Smith&#x27;s first acting credit) began in 1990, while &quot;In the House&quot; (on NBC and UPN) aired from 1995 to 1999. Jones also produced first-run syndication&#x27;s &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot; (in association with Telepictures Productions, 1994–1997 only) and FOX&#x27;s &quot;Mad TV&quot;, which ran for 14 seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.quincyjones.com/about&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, he started a huge, ongoing project called &quot;The Evolution of Black Music&quot;. QJE started a weekly talk show with Jones&#x27;s friend, Reverend Jesse Jackson, as the host.

Beginning in the late 1970s, Jones had tried to convince Miles Davis to revive the music he recorded on several classic albums of the 1950s, which was arranged by Gil Evans. Davis always refused, citing a desire to avoid revisiting the past. In 1991, Davis relented. Despite having pneumonia, he agreed to perform the music at the Montreux Jazz Festival. The recording, &quot;Miles &amp; Quincy Live at Montreux&quot;, was his last album; he died several months afterward. Jones had a brief appearance in the 1990 video for the Time song &quot;Jerk Out&quot;, and was a guest actor on an episode of &quot;The Boondocks&quot;. He appeared with Ray Charles in the music video of their song &quot;One Mint Julep&quot; and also with Ray Charles and Chaka Khan in the music video of their song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Good to You&quot;. Jones hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on February 10, 1990, during &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s 15th season. The episode was notable for having 10 musical guests, the most any &quot;SNL&quot; episode has had in its years on the air: Tevin Campbell, Andrae Crouch, Sandra Crouch, rappers Kool Moe Dee and Big Daddy Kane, Melle Mel, Quincy D III, Siedah Garrett, Al Jarreau, and Take 6, and for a performance of Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s &quot;Manteca&quot; by the SNL Band, conducted by Jones. Jones impersonated Marion Barry, the former mayor of Washington, D.C., in the recurring sketch &quot;The Bob Waltman Special&quot;. He later produced his own sketch comedy show, FOX&#x27;s &quot;Mad TV&quot;, which ran from 1995 to 2009.
In 1993, Jones collaborated with David Salzman to produce the concert &quot;An American Reunion&quot;, a celebration of Bill Clinton&#x27;s inauguration as President of the United States. During the same year, he and Salzman renamed his company to Quincy Jones/David Salzman Entertainment.

In 2001, Jones published his autobiography &quot;Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones&quot;. In a 2002 interview, when asked if he would work with Jones again, Michael Jackson suggested he might. But in 2007, when Jones was asked by &quot;NME&quot;, he said: &quot;Man, please! We already did that. I have talked to him about working with him again but I&#x27;ve got too much to do. I&#x27;ve got 900 products, I&#x27;m 74 years old.&quot; Following Jackson&#x27;s death on June 25, 2009, Jones said, &quot;I am absolutely devastated at this tragic and unexpected news. For Michael to be taken away from us so suddenly at such a young age, I just don&#x27;t have the words. Divinity brought our souls together on &quot;The Wiz&quot; and allowed us to do what we were able to throughout the &#x27;80s. To this day, the music we created together on &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot; is played in every corner of the world, and the reason for that is because he had it all... talent, grace, professionalism, and dedication. He was the consummate entertainer, and his contributions and legacy will be felt upon the world forever. I&#x27;ve lost my little brother today, and part of my soul has gone with him.&quot;

Jones appeared in the 1999 Walt Disney Pictures animated film &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, introducing the set piece of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;. In 2002, he made a cameo appearance as himself in the film &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;. On February 10, 2008, Jones joined Usher in presenting the Grammy Award for Album of the Year to Herbie Hancock.

On January 6, 2009, Jones appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; to discuss his career. Daly informally floated the idea that Jones should become the first minister of culture for the United States, pending the inauguration of Barack Obama as president. Daly noted that only the US and Germany, among leading world countries, did not have a cabinet-level position for this role. Commentators on NPR and in the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; also discussed the topic of a minister of culture.
In July 2007, Jones partnered with Wizzard Media to start the Quincy Jones Video Podcast. In each episode, he shares his knowledge and experience in the music industry. The first episode features him in the studio producing &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot; for Celine Dion. This song is included on the Ennio Morricone tribute album &quot;We All Love Ennio Morricone&quot;. Jones helped produce Anita Hall&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Send Love&quot;. In 2013, he produced Emily Bear&#x27;s album &quot;Diversity&quot;. After that, he produced albums for Grace, Justin Kauflin, Alfredo Rodríguez, Andreas Varady, and Nikki Yanofsky. He also became a mentor to Jacob Collier.

In 2010, Jones, along with brand strategist Chris Vance, co-founded Playground Sessions, a NY City-based developer of subscription software that teaches people to play the piano using interactive videos. Pianists Harry Connick Jr. and David Sides are among the company&#x27;s video instructors. Jones worked with Vance and Sides to develop the video lessons and incorporate techniques to modernize the instruction format.

In February 2014, Jones appeared in &quot;Keep on Keepin&#x27; On&quot;, a documentary about his friend, jazz trumpeter and flugelhorn player Clark Terry. In the film, Terry introduces Jones to his protégé Justin Kauflin, whom Jones then signs to his band and label. In July 2014, Jones starred in a documentary film called &quot;The Distortion of Sound&quot;. He was featured on Jacob Collier&#x27;s YouTube cover of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)&quot;. On February 28, 2016, he and Pharrell Williams presented Ennio Morricone with the Oscar for Best Original Score. In August 2016, he and his music were featured at the BBC Proms in the Royal Albert Hall, London. In 2017, Jones and French producer Reza Ackbaraly started Qwest TV, the world&#x27;s first subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) service for jazz and eclectic music from around the world. The platform features a handpicked selection of ad-free concerts, interviews, documentaries, and exclusive, original content, all in HD or 4K.

On March 20, 2020, Jones appeared in a music video by Travis Scott and Young Thug for the song &quot;Out West&quot;. In January 2022, Jones appeared on the album &quot;Dawn FM&quot; by Canadian singer the Weeknd, performing a monolog in the sixth track, &quot;A Tale by Quincy&quot;.

==Activism==

Jones&#x27;s social activism began in the 1960s with his support of Martin Luther King Jr. Jones was one of the founders of the Institute for Black American Music (IBAM), whose events aimed to raise funds for the creation of a national library of African-American art and music. Jones was also one of the founders of the Black Arts Festival in his hometown of Chicago. In the 1970s, Jones formed the Quincy Jones Workshops. Meeting at the Los Angeles Landmark Variety Arts Center, the workshops educated and honed the skills of inner-city youth in musicianship, acting, and songwriting. Among its alumni were Alton McClain, who had a hit song with Alton McClain and Destiny, and Mark Wilkins, who co-wrote the hit song &quot;Havin&#x27; a Love Attack&quot; with Mandrill and became National Promotion Director for Mystic Records.

For many years, Jones worked closely with Bono of U2 on a number of philanthropic causes. He was the founder of the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation, a nonprofit organization that built more than 100 homes in South Africa and which aimed to connect youths with technology, education, culture, and music. One of the organization&#x27;s programs was an intercultural exchange between underprivileged youths from Los Angeles and South Africa.

In 2004, Jones helped to launch the We Are the Future (WAF) project, which gave children in poor and conflict-ridden areas a chance to live their childhoods and develop a sense of hope. The program was the result of a strategic partnership between the Global Forum, the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation, and Hani Masri, with the support of the World Bank, UN agencies, and major companies. The project was launched with a concert in Rome, Italy, in front of an audience of half a million people.

Jones supported a number of other charities, including the NAACP, GLAAD, Peace Games, AmfAR, and the Maybach Foundation. He served on the advisory board of HealthCorps. In July 2007, he announced his endorsement of Hillary Clinton for president. With the election of Barack Obama, Jones said that his next conversation &quot;with President Obama [will be] to beg for a secretary of arts&quot;. This prompted the circulation of an internet petition, asking Obama to create such a Cabinet-level position in his administration.

In 2001, Jones became an honorary member of the board of directors of the Jazz Foundation of America. He worked with the foundation to save the homes and lives of America&#x27;s elderly jazz and blues musicians, including those who had survived Hurricane Katrina. Jones was a spokesperson for the Global Down Syndrome Foundation, co-founded by his friend John Sie, which annually awarded the Quincy Jones Exceptional Advocacy Award. He was also involved in the Linda Crnic Institute which aimed to improve the lives of people with Down Syndrome through advanced biomedical research.

==Personal life==
=== Marriages and family ===
Jones was married three times and had seven children with five women. He was married to Jeri Caldwell from 1957 to 1966, and they had a daughter named Jolie. He had a brief affair with Carol Reynolds, and they had a daughter named Rachel. He was later married to Swedish actress Ulla Andersson from 1967 to 1974, and they had a daughter named Martina and a son named Quincy, who also became a music producer.

The day after his divorce from Andersson, Jones married American actress Peggy Lipton. They had two daughters, Kidada, who was born before they were married, and Rashida, both of whom became actresses. Jones and Lipton divorced in 1990. He later dated and lived with German actress Nastassja Kinski from 1991 to 1995, and they had a daughter named Kenya, who became a fashion model. In an interview with &quot;New York Magazine&quot; Jones stated that he dated Ivanka Trump.

In 1994, rapper Tupac Shakur criticized Jones for having relationships with white women, prompting Jones&#x27;s daughter Rashida to pen a scathing open letter in response, which was published in &quot;The Source&quot;. Jones&#x27;s daughter Kidada developed a romantic relationship with Shakur, became engaged to him, and had been living with him for four months at the time of his death.

=== Interests and beliefs ===

Jones never learned to drive, citing his involvement in a car crash at age 14 as the reason. During this time, he and a group of friends were heading to a rodeo in Yakima when a bus hit them. He said everybody in the car died except him—the scene was gruesome and left him traumatized. He attempted to take driving lessons a few years later but he &quot;just couldn&#x27;t do it&quot; and never drove again.

Jones revealed that Ray Charles introduced him to heroin at the age of 15, although he stopped using it after five months. He was a believer in astrology. In regard to religion, he stated in February 2018 that he believed in a God that opposes the love of money but dismisses the notion of an afterlife. He held a negative opinion of the Catholic Church, believing it is built upon the notions of money and &quot;fear, smoke, and murder&quot;. Jones claimed to have knowledge of the truth of the Kennedy assassination, stating his belief that mobster Sam Giancana was responsible, as well as outing sexual relationships Marlon Brando had with James Baldwin, Richard Pryor, and Marvin Gaye.

=== Legal issues===
In October 2013, the BBC and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said Jones planned to sue Michael Jackson&#x27;s estate for $10 million. Jones said that MJJ Productions, a song company managed by Jackson&#x27;s estate and Sony Music Entertainment, improperly re-edited songs to deprive him of royalties and production fees and breached an agreement giving him the right to remix master recordings for albums released after Jackson&#x27;s death. The songs Jones produced for Jackson were used in the film &quot;This Is It&quot;. Jones was reported to be filing the suits against the Michael Jackson Cirque du Soleil shows and the 25th-anniversary edition of the &quot;Bad&quot; album. He believed he should have received a producer credit in the film.

=== Health issues and death ===
In 1974, Jones developed a life-threatening brain aneurysm, leading to a decision to reduce his workload to spend time with his friends and family. Since his family and friends believed that Jones&#x27;s life was coming to an end, they started to plan a memorial service for him. He attended his own service with his neurologist by his side, in case the excitement overwhelmed him. Some of the entertainers at his service were Richard Pryor, Marvin Gaye, Sarah Vaughan, and Sidney Poitier.

Jones had two brain surgeries, and after the second was warned to never play the trumpet again, because &quot;if he blew a trumpet in the ways that a trumpet player must, the clip [a metal plate in his head that was implanted after his brain aneurysm] would come free and he would die&quot;. He ignored that advice, went on tour in Japan, and one night after playing trumpet had a pain in his head. Doctors said the plate in his brain had nearly come loose, as they had warned, and Jones never played the trumpet again.

On November 3, 2024, Jones died at his home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles at the age of 91. His publicist confirmed his death. The cause of death was not immediately disclosed, but was later revealed to be pancreatic cancer. He was buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles.

== Artistry, legacy and tributes ==

President Joe Biden issued a statement praising Jones as &quot;a great unifier, who believed deeply in the healing power of music to restore hope and uplift those suffering from hunger, poverty, and violence, in America and the continent of Africa&quot;. Former President Barack Obama praised Jones for &quot;building a career that took him from the streets of Chicago to the heights of Hollywood... paving the way for generations of Black executives to leave their mark on the entertainment business&quot;. Former President Bill Clinton stated, &quot;He changed the face of the music industry forever&quot;. Vice President Kamala Harris called him a &quot;trailblazer&quot; and remembered him for his &quot;championing of civil and human rights&quot;.

Numerous celebrities and public figures paid their tributes such as Steven Spielberg, Michael Caine, Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Morgan Freeman, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ron Howard, Francis Ford Coppola, Colman Domingo, Will Smith, Clive Davis and Berry Gordy. Several musicians that have paid tribute include Paul McCartney, BP Fallon, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, John Legend, Lenny Kravitz, Darius Rucker, Nile Rodgers, David Guetta, Kelly Rowland, Victoria Monét, Gladys Knight, Ice-T, The Weeknd, Pharrell Williams, and Russ.

Brazilian musicians Simone, Ivan Lins, Milton Nascimento and percussionist Paulinho da Costa were close friends and partners in Jones&#x27;s most recent works. Japanese film composer Joe Hisaishi, came up with his alias (久石 譲, &quot;Hisaishi Jō)&quot; as a play on Jones&#x27;s name.

==Awards and honors==

In 1968, Jones became the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;The Eyes of Love&quot; from the film &quot;Banning&quot; (1967). Jones was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score for his work on the 1967 film &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, making him the first African American to be nominated twice in the same year. In 1971, Jones became the first African American to be the musical director and conductor of the Academy Awards. He became, in 1995, the first African American to receive the academy&#x27;s Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. He tied with sound designer Willie D. Burton as the second most Oscar-nominated African American, with seven nominations each.

<text>Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve (, trans. &quot;Vasily Yakovlevich Struve&quot;; 15 April 1793 – ) was a Baltic German astronomer and geodesist. He is best known for studying double stars and initiating a triangulation survey later named Struve Geodetic Arc in his honor.

==Life==

He was born to the aristocratic Struve family at Altona, Duchy of Holstein (then a part of the Denmark–Norway kingdoms), the son of Jacob Struve (1755–1841). To avoid military service during the French occupation of Holstein, his family moved to the Russian Empire, equipped with Danish passports.

In 1808 he entered the University of Tartu (Dorpat), where he first studied philology, but soon turned his attention to astronomy. From 1813 to 1820, he taught at the university and collected data at the Tartu Observatory, and in 1820 became a full professor and director of the observatory. His teachings have had a strong effect that is still felt at the university.

Struve was occupied with research on double stars and geodesy in Dorpat until 1839, when he founded and became director of the new Pulkovo Observatory near St Petersburg. Among other honors, he won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1826. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March 1827 and was awarded their Royal Medal the same year. Struve was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1833, and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1834. In 1843 he formally adopted Russian nationality. He retired in 1862 due to failing health.

The asteroid 768 Struveana was named jointly in his honour and that of Otto Wilhelm and Karl Hermann Struve and a lunar crater was named for another 3 astronomers of the Struve family: Friedrich Georg Wilhelm, Otto Wilhelm and Otto.

==Works==

Struve&#x27;s name is best known for his observations of double stars, which he carried on for many years. Although double stars had been studied earlier by William Herschel, John Herschel and Sir James South, Struve outdid any previous efforts. While at Dorpat he obtained in 1824 a refracting telescope with an aperture of 23 cm (about 9 inches) made by Joseph von Fraunhofer, said to be a masterpiece of optical and mechanical quality. With this telescope Struve discovered a very large number of double stars. In 1827 published his double star catalogue &quot;Catalogus novus stellarum duplicium&quot;. Stars of his catalogue are sometimes indicated by the Greek letter sigma, Σ. Thus, 61 Cygni is also designated as Σ2758.

Since most double stars are true binary stars rather than mere optical doubles (as William Herschel had been the first to discover), they orbit around their common barycenter and slowly change position over the years. Thus Struve made micrometric measurements of 2714 double stars from 1824 to 1837 and published these in his work &quot;Stellarum duplicium et multiplicium mensurae micrometricae&quot;.

Struve carefully measured the &quot;constant of aberration&quot; in 1843. He was also the first to measure the parallax of the star Vega, although Friedrich Bessel had been the first to measure the parallax of a star (61 Cygni).

In an 1847 work, &quot;Etudes d&#x27;Astronomie Stellaire: Sur la voie lactee et sur la distance des etoiles fixes,&quot; Struve was one of the first astronomers to identify the effects of interstellar extinction (though he provided no mechanism to explain the effect). His estimate of the average rate of visual extinction, 1 mag per kpc, is remarkably close to modern estimates (0.7–1.0 mag per kpc).

He was also interested in geodetic surveying, and in 1831 published &quot;Beschreibung der Breitengradmessung in den Ostseeprovinzen Russlands&quot;. He initiated the Struve Geodetic Arc, a chain of survey triangulations stretching from Hammerfest in Norway to the Black Sea, through ten countries and over 2,820 km, to establish the exact size and shape of the earth. UNESCO listed the chain on its List of World Heritage Sites in Europe in 2005.

In 1853, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Family==
Struve was the second of a dynasty of astronomers through five generations. He was the great-grandfather of Otto Struve and the father of Otto Wilhelm von Struve. He was also the grandfather of Hermann von Struve, who was Otto Struve&#x27;s uncle.

In 1815 he married Emilie Wall (1796–1834) in Altona, who bore 12 children, 8 of whom survived early childhood. In addition to Otto Wilhelm von Struve, other children were Heinrich Wilhelm von Struve (1822–1908), a prominent chemist, and (1827–1889), who served as a government official in Siberia and later as governor of Astrakhan and Perm.

After his first wife died, he remarried to Johanna Henriette Francisca Bartels (1807–1867), a daughter of the mathematician Martin Bartels, who bore him six more children. The most well-known was Karl von Struve (1835–1907), who served successively as Russian ambassador to Japan, the United States, and the Netherlands.

Bernhard&#x27;s son Pyotr Struve (1870–1944) is probably the best known member of the family in Russia proper (his other descendants mainly resided in Estonia and Latvia, and subsequently in Germany). He was one of the first Russian marxists and penned the manifesto of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party upon its creation in 1898. Even before the party split into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Struve left it for the Constitutional Democratic party, which promoted ideas of liberalism. He represented this party at all the pre-revolutionary State Dumas. After the Russian Revolution, he published several striking articles on its causes and joined the White movement. He was one of the ministers in the governments of Pyotr Wrangel and Denikin. During the following three decades, Pyotr lived in Paris, while his children were prominent in the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia.

<doc id="205512" wikidata="Q24980" url="?curid=205512" title="Monty Python's The Meaning of Life">
<text>Monty Python&#x27;s The Meaning of Life, also known simply as The Meaning of Life, is a 1983 British musical sketch comedy film written and performed by the Monty Python troupe, directed by Terry Jones. &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; was the last feature film to star all six Python members before the death of Graham Chapman in 1989.

Unlike &quot;Holy Grail&quot; and &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, the film&#x27;s two predecessors, which each told a single, more-or-less coherent story, &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; returned to the sketch format of the troupe&#x27;s original television series and their first film from twelve years earlier, &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot;, loosely structured as a series of comic sketches about the various stages of life. It was accompanied by the short film &quot;The Crimson Permanent Assurance&quot;.

Released on 23 June 1983 in the United Kingdom, &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; was not as acclaimed as its predecessors, but was still well received critically and was a minor box office success; the film grossed almost $43 million against a $9 million budget. It was screened at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Grand Prix. The film appears in a 2010 list of the top 20 cult films published by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;.

==Plot==
Six fish in a restaurant&#x27;s tank greet each other, then see their friend being eaten. This leads them to question the meaning of life. In the first sketch, &quot;The Miracle of Birth&quot;, maternity doctors ignore a woman in labour while trying to impress the hospital&#x27;s administrator. In Yorkshire, a Roman Catholic man is made redundant from his job, and informs his numerous children that he must sell them for scientific experiments (&quot;Every Sperm Is Sacred&quot;). A Protestant man looks on disapprovingly and proudly remarks that Protestants can use contraception and have sex for pleasure (although his wife observes that they never do).

In &quot;Growth and Learning&quot;, a class of boys learn school etiquette before partaking in a sex education lesson, which involves watching their teacher have sex with his wife. One boy laughs and is forced into a violent rugby match pitting pupils against the school masters as punishment. &quot;Fighting Each Other&quot; features three scenes concerning the British military. First, during the Battle of the Somme in World War I, a British officer tries to rally his men during an attack, but they instead present him with going-away gifts. Second, a modern army RSM bullies his soldiers to say what they would rather be doing than drill practice, then dismisses each in turn. Lastly, in 1879 during the Anglo-Zulu War during the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, a soldier finds his leg has been bitten off. Suspecting a tiger, the soldiers hunt for it and find two men in a tiger costume.

An announcer introduces &quot;The Middle of the Film,&quot; during which bizarre characters challenge the audience in a segment called &quot;Find the Fish.&quot; &quot;Middle Age&quot; involves an American couple visiting a Hawaiian restaurant with a medieval torture theme, where, to the interest of the fish, the waiter offers a conversation about philosophy and the meaning of life. The customers are unable to make sense of it and move on to a discussion of live organ transplants. In &quot;Live Organ Transplants&quot;, two paramedics visit an organ donor and remove his liver while he is alive. His wife is reluctant to donate her liver, but she relents after a man steps out of a refrigerator and reminds her of humanity&#x27;s insignificance in the universe (&quot;Galaxy Song&quot;). Executives of an American conglomerate debate the meaning of life before a raid by The Crimson Permanent Assurance briefly interrupts them.

&quot;The Autumn Years&quot; starts off with a musician in a French restaurant singing about the joys of having a penis (&quot;The Not Noël Coward Song&quot;). As the song ends, the ill-tempered glutton Mr. Creosote enters the restaurant, causing the fish to scatter and hide. He vomits continuously and devours an enormous meal. After the maître d&#x27;hôtel persuades him to eat an after-dinner mint, Creosote&#x27;s gut explodes, splattering the other diners. In &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;, the restaurant&#x27;s cleaning woman proposes that life is meaningless before revealing that she is a racist. A waiter leads the audience to the house where he was born, recalls his mother&#x27;s lessons about kindness, and then becomes angry when his point trails off.

&quot;Death&quot; features a condemned man choosing the manner of his own execution: being chased off the Cliffs of Dover by topless women in sports gear and falling into his own grave below. In a short animated sequence, despondent leaves commit suicide by throwing themselves from the branches of a tree. The Grim Reaper enters an isolated home and convinces the hosts and dinner guests, with difficulty, that they are all dead. They accompany the Grim Reaper to Heaven, revealed to be the Hawaiian restaurant from earlier. They enter a Las Vegas-style hotel where it is always Christmas and meet the characters from the previous sketches, where a Tony Bennett-esque singer begins to sing about various commercial items that can be bought in Heaven and how amazing life is there (&quot;Christmas in Heaven&quot;).

The song ends abruptly for &quot;The End of the Film&quot;. The hostess from &quot;The Middle of the Film&quot; opens an envelope and blandly reveals the meaning of life: &quot;It&#x27;s nothing very special, really. Try and be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations&quot;.

==Production==
According to Palin, &quot;the writing process was quite cumbersome. An awful lot of material didn&#x27;t get used. &quot;Holy Grail&quot; had a structure, a loose one: the search for the grail. Same with &quot;Life of Brian&quot;. With this, it wasn&#x27;t so clear. In the end, we just said: &#x27;Well, what the heck. We have got lots of good material, let&#x27;s give it the loosest structure, which will be the meaning of life&#x27;&quot;.

After the film&#x27;s title was chosen, Douglas Adams called Jones to tell him he had just finished a new book, to be called &quot;The Meaning of Liff&quot;; Jones was initially concerned about the similarity in titles, which led to the scene in the title sequence of a tombstone which, when hit by a flash of lightning, changes from &quot;The Meaning of Liff&quot; to &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;.
Principal photography began on 12 July 1982 and was completed about two months later, on 11 September. A wide variety of locations were used, such as Porchester Hall in Queensway for the Mr Creosote sketch, where hundreds of pounds of fake vomit had to be cleaned up on the last day due to a wedding being scheduled hours later. The Malham Moors were chosen for the Grim Reaper segment; the countryside near Strathblane was used for the Zulu War; and &quot;Every Sperm Is Sacred&quot; was shot in Colne, Lancashire, with interiors done at Elstree Studios. The school chapel scene with the song &quot;O Lord, Please Don&#x27;t Burn Us&quot; was shot at Churchill College, Cambridge.

The film was produced on a budget of less than US$10 million, which was still bigger than that of the earlier films. This allowed for large-scale choreography and crowd sequences, a more lavishly produced soundtrack that included new original songs, and much more time able to be spent on each sketch, especially &quot;The Crimson Permanent Assurance&quot;. Palin later said that the larger budget, and not making the film for the BBC (i.e., television), allowed the film to be more daring and dark.

The idea for the hospital sketch came from Chapman, himself a doctor, who had noticed that hospitals were changing, with &quot;lots and lots of machinery&quot;. According to Palin, the organ transplant scene harked back to Python&#x27;s love of bureaucracy, and sketches with lots of people coming round from the council with different bits of paper.

During the filming of the scene where Palin&#x27;s character explains Catholicism to his children, his line was &quot;that rubber thing at the end of my &quot;sock&quot;&quot;, which was later overdubbed with &quot;cock&quot;.

===&quot;The Crimson Permanent Assurance&quot;===

The short film &quot;The Crimson Permanent Assurance&quot; introduces the feature. It is about a group of elderly office clerks working in a small accounting firm. They rebel against yuppie corporate masters, transform their office building into a pirate ship, and raid a large financial district. One of the boardrooms raided reappears later in the film, from shortly before the attack begins until the narrator apologises and a skyscraper falls and crushes the marauders.

The short was intended as an animated sequence in the feature, for placement at the end of Part V. Gilliam persuaded the other members of Monty Python to allow him to produce and direct it as a live action piece instead.

==Release==
The original tagline read &quot;It took God six days to create the Heavens and the Earth, and Monty Python just 90 minutes to screw it up&quot; (the length of &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; proper is 90 minutes, but becomes 107 minutes as released with the &quot;Short Subject Presentation&quot;, &quot;The Crimson Permanent Assurance&quot;). In an April 2012 re-release held by the American Film Institute, the tagline is altered to read &quot;It took God six days to create the Heavens and the Earth, and Monty Python just 1 hour and 48 minutes to screw it up&quot;.

Ireland banned the film on its original release as it had previously done with &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;, but later rated it 15 when it was released on video. In the United Kingdom the film was rated 18 when released in the cinema and on its first release on video, but was re-rated 15 in 2000. In the United States the film is rated R.

The film opened in the United States on 31 March 1983. At 257 cinemas it ranked number six at the US box office, grossing US$1,987,853 ($7,734 per screen) in its opening weekend. It played at 554 cinemas at its widest point, and its total gross in the United States and Canada was $14,929,552. In the United Kingdom it opened on 3 screens in London and grossed £49,641 in its first seven days to rank third at the London box office. Internationally it grossed $27.8 million for a worldwide total of $42.7 million.

===Critical reception===
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two and a half stars out of four, calling it a &quot;a barbed, uncompromising attack on generally observed community standards&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby declared it &quot;the &quot;Ben Hur&quot; of sketch films, which is to say that it&#x27;s a tiny bit out of proportion&quot;, concluding it was amusing, but he wished it were consistently amusing. &quot;Variety&quot; staff assessed it as disgusting, ridiculous, tactless, but above all, amusing. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded 3 stars out of 4, calling it &quot;fresh and original and delightfully offensive. What more can you ask of a comedy?&quot; Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film was full of &quot;raunchy talk, blasphemy (well, sacrilege) and one example of what kids call a totally &quot;gnarly,&quot; gross-out scene. The problem for the reviewer (to be specific, this reviewer) is when you are laughing this much it makes logging all the fast-flying offenses almost impossible.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was negative, writing that &quot;The strongest impressions left by this picture have less to do with its largely tedious attempts to burlesque human weakness and pomposity than with the group&#x27;s failure to evolve a coherent satiric outlook.&quot; A review by Steve Jenkins in &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; was also negative, writing that the return to a sketch format constituted a &quot;great leap backwards&quot; for the troupe and that the film&#x27;s outrageous moments &quot;cannot disguise the overall air of &quot;déjà vu&quot; and playing it safe.&quot;

In 2004, acclaimed director Quentin Tarantino once stated &quot;The only time I&#x27;ve ever had to look away, because I couldn&#x27;t bear to watch, was &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;, when that fat b***ard keeps being sick. I felt really nauseous – it was just too much. I was looking around and I thought, &#x27;If anyone here is sick and I have to smell vomit, I&#x27;m going to hurl&#x27;. I just about held onto my lunch in the end, but I still can&#x27;t think about that scene without retching.&quot;

In 2007, &quot;Empire&quot;″s Ian Nathan rated it three of five stars, describing it as &quot;too piecemeal and unfocused, but it possesses some of their most iconic musings and inspired madness&quot;. In 2014, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; gave the film four stars out of five. In his &quot;2015 Movie Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin awarded it three stars, calling it &quot;A barrel of bellylaughs&quot;, identifying the Mr. Creosote and &quot;Every Sperm Is Sacred&quot; sketches as the most memorable. 
&quot;Family Guy&quot; creator Seth MacFarlane states: “I view Monty Python as the great originator of that combination [provocative humour and high-quality original music]. &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; in particular comes to mind, and my favorite example is &quot;Every Sperm Is Sacred.&quot; It&#x27;s so beautifully written, it&#x27;s musically and lyrically legit, the orchestrations are fantastic, the choreography and the presentation are very, very complex – it&#x27;s treated seriously.&quot; The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 86% based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 7.30/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s the Meaning of Life&quot; is rude, ribald, and unafraid to take comedic risks – which is to say it should more than satisfy fans of the titular troupe.&quot; 

===Accolades===
&quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; was awarded the Grand Jury Prize at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival. While the Cannes jury, led by William Styron, were fiercely split on their opinions on several films in competition, &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; had general support, securing it the second-highest honour after the Palme d&#x27;Or for &quot;The Ballad of Narayama&quot;.

At the 37th British Academy Film Awards, Andre Jacquemin, Dave Howman, Michael Palin and Terry Jones were also nominated for Original Song for &quot;Every Sperm is Sacred.&quot; The award went to &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot; in &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;.

==Home media==
A two-disc DVD release in 2003 features a documentary on production and a director&#x27;s cut, which adds deleted scenes into the film, making it 116 minutes. The first is &quot;The Adventures of Martin Luther&quot;, inserted after the scene with the Protestant couple talking about condoms. The second is a promotional video about the British army, which comes between the marching around the square scene and the Zulu army scene. The third and last is an extension of the American characters performed by Idle and Palin; they are shown their room and talk about tampons. In Region 1, it was released on Blu-ray to mark its 30th anniversary.
In May 2020, it was released on Netflix in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="205513" wikidata="Q1394690" url="?curid=205513" title="George Peacock">
<text>George Peacock FRS (9 April 1791 – 8 November 1858) was an English mathematician and Anglican cleric. He founded what has been called the British algebra of logic.

==Early life==
Peacock was born on 9 April 1791 at Thornton Hall, Denton, near Darlington, County Durham. His father, Thomas Peacock, was a priest of the Church of England, incumbent and for 50 years curate of the parish of Denton, where he also kept a school. In early life, Peacock did not show any precocity of genius. He was more remarkable for daring feats of climbing than for any special attachment to study. Initially, he received his elementary education from his father and then at Sedbergh School, and at 17 years of age, he was sent to Richmond School under James Tate, a graduate of Cambridge University. At this school he distinguished himself greatly both in classics and in the rather elementary mathematics then required for entrance at Cambridge. In 1809 he became a student of Trinity College, Cambridge.

In 1812 Peacock took the rank of Second Wrangler, and the second Smith&#x27;s prize, the senior wrangler being John Herschel. Two years later, he became a candidate for a fellowship in his college and won it immediately, partly by means of his extensive and accurate knowledge of the classics. A fellowship then meant about £200 a year, tenable for seven years provided the Fellow did not marry meanwhile, and capable of being extended after the seven years provided the Fellow took clerical orders, which Peacock did in 1819.

==Mathematical career==
The year after taking a Fellowship, Peacock was appointed a tutor and lecturer of his college, which position he continued to hold for many years. Peacock, in common with many other students of his own standing, was profoundly impressed with the need of reforming Cambridge&#x27;s position ignoring the differential notation for calculus, and while still an undergraduate formed a league with Babbage and Herschel to adopt measures to bring it about. In 1815 they formed what they called the &quot;Analytical Society&quot;, the object of which was stated to be to advocate the &quot;d&quot; &#x27;ism of the Continent versus the &quot;dot&quot;-age of the university.

The first movement on the part of the Analytical Society was to translate from the French the smaller work of Lacroix on the differential and integral calculus; it was published in 1816. At that time the French language had the best manuals, as well as the greatest works on mathematics. Peacock followed up the translation with a volume containing a copious &quot;Collection of Examples of the Application of the Differential and Integral Calculus&quot;, which was published in 1820. The sale of both books was rapid, and contributed materially to further the object of the Society. In that time, high wranglers of one year became the examiners of the mathematical tripos three or four years afterwards. Peacock was appointed an examiner in 1817, and he did not fail to make use of the position as a powerful lever to advance the cause of reform. In his questions set for the examination the differential notation was for the first time officially employed in Cambridge. The innovation did not escape censure, but he wrote to a friend as follows: &quot;I assure you that I shall never cease to exert myself to the utmost in the cause of reform, and that I will never decline any office which may increase my power to effect it. I am nearly certain of being nominated to the office of Moderator in the year 1818-1819, and as I am an examiner in virtue of my office, for the next year I shall pursue a course even more decided than hitherto, since I shall feel that men have been prepared for the change, and will then be enabled to have acquired a better system by the publication of improved elementary books. I have considerable influence as a lecturer, and I will not neglect it. It is by silent perseverance only, that we can hope to reduce the many-headed monster of prejudice and make the University answer her character as the loving mother of good learning and science.&quot; These few sentences give an insight into the character of Peacock: he was an ardent reformer and a few years brought success to the cause of the Analytical Society.

Another reform at which Peacock labored was the teaching of algebra. In 1830 he published &quot;A Treatise on Algebra&quot; which had for its object the placing of algebra on a true scientific basis, adequate for the development which it had received at the hands of the Continental mathematicians. To elevate astronomical science the Astronomical Society of London was founded, and the three reformers Peacock, Babbage and Herschel were again prime movers in the undertaking. Peacock was one of the most zealous promoters of an astronomical observatory at Cambridge, and one of the founders of the Philosophical Society of Cambridge.

In 1831 the British Association for the Advancement of Science (prototype of the American, French and Australasian Associations) held its first meeting in the ancient city of York. One of the first resolutions adopted was to procure reports on the state and progress of particular sciences, to be drawn up from time to time by competent persons for the information of the annual meetings, and the first to be placed on the list was a report on the progress of mathematical science. Whewell, the mathematician and philosopher, was a vice-president of the meeting: he was instructed to select the reporter. He first asked William Rowan Hamilton, who declined; he then asked Peacock, who accepted. Peacock had his report ready for the third meeting of the Association, which was held in Cambridge in 1833; although limited to Algebra, Trigonometry, and the Arithmetic of Sines, it is one of the best of the long series of valuable reports which have been prepared for and printed by the Association.

In 1837 Peacock was appointed Lowndean Professor of Astronomy in the University of Cambridge, the chair afterwards occupied by Adams, the co-discoverer of Neptune, and later occupied by Robert Ball, celebrated for his &quot;Theory of Screws&quot;. An object of reform was the statutes of the university; he worked hard at it and was made a member of a commission appointed by the Government for the purpose.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in January 1818.

In 1842, Peacock was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Clerical career==

He was ordained as a deacon in 1819, a priest in 1822 and appointed vicar of Wymeswold in Leicestershire in 1826 (until 1835).

In 1839 he was appointed Dean of Ely cathedral, Cambridgeshire, a position he held for the rest of his life, some 20 years. Together with the architect George Gilbert Scott he undertook a major restoration of the cathedral building. This included the installation of the boarded ceiling.

While holding this position he wrote a text book on algebra, &quot;A Treatise on Algebra&quot; (1830). Later, a second edition appeared in two volumes, the one called &quot;Arithmetical Algebra&quot; (1842) and the other &quot;On Symbolical Algebra and its Applications to the Geometry of Position&quot; (1845).

==Symbolical algebra==

Peacock&#x27;s main contribution to mathematical analysis is his attempt to place algebra on a strictly logical basis. He founded what has been called the British algebra of logic; to which Gregory, De Morgan and Boole belonged. His answer to Maseres and Frend was that the science of algebra consisted of two parts—arithmetical algebra and symbolical algebra—and that they erred in restricting the science to the arithmetical part. His view of arithmetical algebra is as follows: &quot;In arithmetical algebra we consider symbols as representing numbers, and the operations to which they are submitted as included in the same definitions as in common arithmetic; the signs formula_1 and formula_2 denote the operations of addition and subtraction in their ordinary meaning only, and those operations are considered as impossible in all cases where the symbols subjected to them possess values which would render them so in case they were replaced by digital numbers; thus in expressions such as formula_3 we must suppose formula_4 and formula_5 to be quantities of the same kind; in others, like formula_6, we must suppose formula_4 greater than formula_5 and therefore homogeneous with it; in products and quotients, like formula_9 and formula_10 we must suppose the multiplier and divisor to be abstract numbers; all results whatsoever, including negative quantities, which are not strictly deducible as legitimate conclusions from the definitions of the several operations must be rejected as impossible, or as foreign to the science.&quot;

Peacock&#x27;s principle may be stated thus: the elementary symbol of arithmetical algebra denotes a digital, i.e., an integer number; and every combination of elementary symbols must reduce to a digital number, otherwise it is impossible or foreign to the science. If formula_4 and formula_5 are numbers, then formula_3 is always a number; but formula_6 is a number only when formula_5 is less than formula_4. Again, under the same conditions, formula_9 is always a number, but formula_10 is really a number only when formula_5 is an exact divisor of formula_4. Hence the following dilemma: Either formula_10 must be held to be an impossible expression in general, or else the meaning of the fundamental symbol of algebra must be extended so as to include rational fractions. If the former horn of the dilemma is chosen, arithmetical algebra becomes a mere shadow; if the latter horn is chosen, the operations of algebra cannot be defined on the supposition that the elementary symbol is an integer number. Peacock attempts to get out of the difficulty by supposing that a symbol which is used as a multiplier is always an integer number, but that a symbol in the place of the multiplicand may be a fraction. For instance, in formula_9, formula_4 can denote only an integer number, but formula_5 may denote a rational fraction. Now there is no more fundamental principle in arithmetical algebra than that formula_25; which would be illegitimate on Peacock&#x27;s principle.

One of the earliest English writers on arithmetic is Robert Recorde, who dedicated his work to King Edward VI. The author gives his treatise the form of a dialogue between master and scholar. The scholar battles long over this difficulty—that multiplying a thing could make it less. The master attempts to explain the anomaly by reference to proportion; that the product due to a fraction bears the same proportion to the thing multiplied that the fraction bears to unity. But the scholar is not satisfied and the master goes on to say: &quot;If I multiply by more than one, the thing is increased; if I take it but once, it is not changed, and if I take it less than once, it cannot be so much as it was before. Then seeing that a fraction is less than one, if I multiply by a fraction, it follows that I do take it less than once.&quot; Whereupon the scholar replies, &quot;Sir, I do thank you much for this reason, – and I trust that I do perceive the thing.&quot;

The fact is that even in arithmetic the two processes of multiplication and division are generalized into a common multiplication; and the difficulty consists in passing from the original idea of multiplication to the generalized idea of a &quot;tensor&quot;, which idea includes compressing the magnitude as well as stretching it. Let formula_26 denote an integer number; the next step is to gain the idea of the reciprocal of formula_26, not as formula_28 but simply as formula_29. When formula_26 and formula_31 are compounded we get the idea of a rational fraction; for in general formula_32 will not reduce to a number nor to the reciprocal of a number.

Suppose, however, that we pass over this objection; how does Peacock lay the foundation for general algebra? He calls it symbolical algebra, and he passes from arithmetical algebra to symbolical algebra in the following manner: &quot;Symbolical algebra adopts the rules of arithmetical algebra but removes altogether their restrictions; thus symbolical subtraction differs from the same operation in arithmetical algebra in being possible for all relations of value of the symbols or expressions employed. All the results of arithmetical algebra which are deduced by the application of its rules, and which are general in form though particular in value, are results likewise of symbolical algebra where they are general in value as well as in form; thus the product of formula_33 and formula_34 which is formula_35 when formula_26 and formula_37 are whole numbers and therefore general in form though particular in value, will be their product likewise when formula_26 and formula_37 are general in value as well as in form; the series for formula_40 determined by the principles of arithmetical algebra when formula_37 is any whole number, &quot;if it be exhibited in a general form, without reference to a final term&quot;, may be shown upon the same principle to the equivalent series for formula_42 when formula_37 is general both in form and value.&quot;

The principle here indicated by means of examples was named by Peacock the &quot;principle of the permanence of equivalent forms,&quot; and at page 59 of the &quot;Symbolical Algebra&quot; it is thus enunciated: &quot;Whatever algebraic forms are equivalent when the symbols are general in form, but specific in value, will be equivalent likewise when the symbols are general in value as well as in form.&quot;

For example, let formula_4, formula_5, formula_46, formula_47 denote any integer numbers, but subject to the restrictions that formula_5 is less than formula_4, and formula_47 less than formula_46; it may then be shown arithmetically that formula_52. Peacock&#x27;s principle says that the form on the left side is equivalent to the form on the right side, not only when the said restrictions of being less are removed, but when formula_4, formula_5, formula_46, formula_47 denote the most general algebraic symbol. It means that formula_4, formula_5, formula_46, formula_47 may be rational fractions, or surds, or imaginary quantities, or indeed operators such as formula_61. The equivalence is not established by means of the nature of the quantity denoted; the equivalence is assumed to be true, and then it is attempted to find the different interpretations which may be put on the symbol.

It is not difficult to see that the problem before us involves the fundamental problem of a rational logic or theory of knowledge; namely, how are we able to ascend from particular truths to more general truths. If formula_4, formula_5, formula_46, formula_47 denote integer numbers, of which formula_5 is less than formula_4 and formula_47 less than formula_46, then formula_52.

It is first seen that the above restrictions may be removed, and still the above equation holds. But the antecedent is still too narrow; the true scientific problem consists in specifying the meaning of the symbols, which, and only which, will admit of the forms being equal. It is not to find &quot;some meanings&quot;, but the &quot;most general meaning&quot;, which allows the equivalence to be true. Let us examine some other cases; we shall find that Peacock&#x27;s principle is not a solution of the difficulty; the great logical process of generalization cannot be reduced to any such easy and arbitrary procedure. When formula_4, formula_26, formula_37 denote integer numbers, it can be shown that formula_74.

According to Peacock the form on the left is always to be equal to the form on the right, and the meanings of formula_4, formula_26, formula_37 are to be found by interpretation. Suppose that formula_4 takes the form of the incommensurate quantity formula_79, the base of the natural system of logarithms. A number is a degraded form of a complex quantity formula_80 and a complex quantity is a degraded form of a quaternion; consequently one meaning which may be assigned to formula_26 and formula_37 is that of quaternion. Peacock&#x27;s principle would lead us to suppose that formula_83, formula_26 and formula_37 denoting quaternions; but that is just what William Rowan Hamilton, the inventor of the quaternion generalization, denies. There are reasons for believing that he was mistaken, and that the forms remain equivalent even under that extreme generalization of formula_26 and formula_37; but the point is this: it is not a question of conventional definition and formal truth; it is a question of objective definition and real truth. Let the symbols have the prescribed meaning, does or does not the equivalence still hold? And if it does not hold, what is the higher or more complex form which the equivalence assumes? Or does such equivalence form even exist?

==Private life==
Politically, George Peacock was a Whig. He married Frances Elizabeth, the daughter of William Selwyn. They had no children.

His last public act was to attend a meeting of the university reform commission. He died in Ely on 8 November 1858, in the 68th year of his age, and was buried in Ely cemetery.

<text>Johann Franz Encke (; 23 September 179126 August 1865) was a German astronomer. Among his activities, he worked on the calculation of the periods of comets and asteroids, measured the distance from the Earth to the Sun, and made observations of the planet Saturn.

==Biography==
Encke was born in Hamburg, where his father was the Pastor at St. James&#x27; Church, Hamburg. He was the youngest of eight children, and at the time his father died, when he was four years old, the family was in straitened circumstances. Thanks to the financial assistance of a teacher, he was able to be educated at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums. He studied mathematics and astronomy from 1811 at the University of Göttingen under Carl Friedrich Gauss, but he enlisted in the Hanseatic Legion for the campaign of 1813–1814, serving as a sergeant in the artillery of the Prussian army, in Holstein and Mecklenburg. In 1814 he resumed his studies at the University, but after Napoleon&#x27;s escape from Elba he returned to the military, serving until 1815 by which time he had become a lieutenant.

Having returned to Göttingen in 1816, he was at once appointed by Bernhardt von Lindenau as his assistant in the observatory of Seeberg near Gotha (he had become acquainted with von Lindenau during his military service). There he completed his investigation of the comet of 1680, for which the Cotta prize was awarded to him in 1817 by judges Gauss and Olbers. He correctly assigned a period of 71 years to the comet of 1812, now known as &quot;12P/Pons-Brooks&quot;.

Following a suggestion by Jean-Louis Pons, who suspected one of the three comets discovered in 1818 to be the same one already discovered by him in 1805, Encke began to calculate the orbital elements of this comet. At this time, all the known comets had an orbital period of seventy years and more, with an aphelion far beyond the orbit of Uranus. The most famous comet of this family was Comet Halley with its period of seventy-six years. Therefore the orbit of the comet discovered by Pons was a sensation, because his orbit was found to have a period of 3.3 years, so that the aphelion had to be within the orbit of Jupiter. Encke predicted its return for 1822; this return was observable only from the southern hemisphere and was seen by Carl Ludwig Christian Rümker in Australia. The comet was also identified with the one seen by Pierre Méchain in 1786 and by Caroline Herschel in 1795.

Encke sent his calculations as a note to Gauss, Olbers, and Bessel. His former mathematics professor published this note and Encke became famous as the discoverer of the short periodic comets. The first object of this family, the Encke comet, was named after him and so it is one of the few comets not named after the discoverer, but after the one who calculated the orbit. Later this comet was identified as the origin of the Taurids meteor showers.

The importance of the predicted return based on the calculation by Encke was rewarded by the Royal Astronomical Society in London by presenting their Gold Medal to him in 1824. In this year Encke married Amalie Becker (1787–1879), daughter of author, bookseller and publisher Rudolph Zacharias Becker, the publisher of works from the Seeberg Observatory. They had three sons and two daughters. In 1825 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

Eight masterly treatises on the comet&#x27;s movements were published by him in the &quot;Berliner Abhandlungen&quot; (1829–1859). From a fresh discussion of the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769 he deduced a solar parallax of 8.57 arcsecond. This and the corresponding distance to the sun were long accepted as authoritative. His results were published in two separate tracts, entitled &quot;Die Entfernung der Sonne&quot; (The distance to the Sun, 1822–1824).

In 1822 he became director of the Seeberg observatory, and in 1825 was promoted to a corresponding position at Berlin, where a new observatory, built under his superintendence and with the support of Alexander von Humboldt and King Frederick William III of Prussia, was inaugurated in 1835. Mostly on the recommendation of Bessel, Encke became director of the new observatory and secretary of the Academy of Sciences.
He directed the preparation of the star maps of the Academy (1830–1859); beginning in 1830, he edited and greatly improved the &quot;Astronomisches Jahrbuch&quot;; and he issued four volumes of the &quot;Astronomische Beobachtungen auf der Sternwarte zu Berlin&quot; (Observations of the Berlin observatory, 1840–1857). Thereafter Encke was involved in the discovery and orbital parameter determination of other short periodic comets and asteroids.

In 1837, Encke described a broad variation in the brightness of the A Ring of Saturn. The Encke Gap was later named in honour of his observations of Saturn&#x27;s rings.

In 1844, Encke became professor of astronomy at the University of Berlin. Much labour was bestowed by him upon facilitating the computation of the movements of the asteroids. With this end in view he expounded to the Berlin Academy in 1849 a mode of determining an elliptic orbit from three observations, and communicated to that body in 1851 a new method of calculating planetary perturbations by means of rectangular coordinates (republished in W. Ostwald&#x27;s &quot;Klassiker der exacten Wissenschaften&quot;, No. 141, 1903).

Encke visited England in 1840. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1836, a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1839, and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849. Incipient brain-disease compelled him to withdraw from official life in November 1863. He still was director of the Berlin observatory until his death on 26 August 1865 in Spandau. His successor was Wilhelm Julius Foerster.

He contributed extensively to the periodical literature of astronomy.

Encke&#x27;s grave is preserved at a cemetery in the Kreuzberg section of Berlin, the &quot;Friedhof II der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde&quot; (Cemetery No. II of the congregations of Jerusalem&#x27;s Church and New Church) (entrance: opposite to 58–60, Zossener Str.; 61, Baruther Str. only for vehicles of the cemetery). His grave is close to that of the mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.

<text>Sir James Mackintosh FRS FRSE (24 October 1765 – 30 May 1832) was a Scottish jurist, Whig politician and Whig historian. His studies and sympathies embraced many interests. He was trained as a doctor and barrister, and worked also as a journalist, judge, administrator, professor, philosopher and politician.

==Early life==
Mackintosh was born at Aldourie, 7 miles from Inverness, the son of Captain John Mackintosh of Kellachie (Kyllachy, near Tomatin, Inverness-shire). His mother was Marjory MacGillivray, a daughter of Alexander MacGillivray and his wife Anne Fraser, who was a sister to Brigadier-General Simon Fraser of Balnain. Both his parents were from old Highland families. His mother died while he was a child, and his father was frequently abroad, mainly due to the Seven Years War – being wounded in 1761 at the Battle of Villinghausen. 

James was raised by his grandmother, and schooled at Fortrose Seminary academy. At age thirteen he proclaimed himself a Whig, and during playtime he persuaded his friends to join him in debates modelled on those of the House of Commons.

He went in 1780 to King&#x27;s College, University of Aberdeen, where he made a lifelong friend of Robert Hall, later a famous preacher. In 1784, he began to study medicine at University of Edinburgh. He participated to the full in the intellectual ferment, became friendly with Benjamin Constant, but did not quite neglect his medical studies, and took his degree in 1787.

In 1788, Mackintosh moved to London, then agitated by the trial of Warren Hastings and the first lapse into insanity of George III. He was much more interested in these and other political events than in his professional prospects. He was also a founder member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (later the RSPCA).

==French Revolution==
Mackintosh was soon absorbed in the question of the time, the French Revolution. In April 1791, after long meditation, he published his &quot;Vindiciae Gallicae: A Defence of the French Revolution and its English Admirers&quot;, a reply to Edmund Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot;. It placed the author in the front rank of European publicists, and won him the friendship of some of the most distinguished men of the time. The success of the &quot;Vindiciae&quot; finally decided him to give up the medical for the legal profession. He was called to the bar in 1795 and gained a considerable reputation there as well as a tolerable practice.

&quot;Vindiciae Gallicae&quot; was the verdict of a philosophic liberal on the development of the French Revolution up to the spring of 1791. The excesses of the revolutionaries compelled him a few years later to oppose them and agree with Burke, but his earlier defence of the rights of man is a valuable statement of the cultured Whig&#x27;s point of view at the time. Mackintosh was the first to see Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections&quot; as &quot;the manifesto of a counter revolution&quot;.

Charles James Fox singled out Mackintosh&#x27;s book as that which did most justice to the French Revolution, and he preferred it over Burke and Thomas Paine. After Paine&#x27;s &quot;Rights of Man&quot;, Mackintosh&#x27;s book was the most successful reply to Burke and Burke&#x27;s biographer F. P. Lock considers it &quot;one of the best of the replies to Burke, in some respects superior to &quot;Rights of Man&quot;&quot;.

The poet Thomas Campbell claimed that had it not been for Mackintosh&#x27;s book, Burke&#x27;s anti-revolutionary opinions would have become universal amongst the educated classes and that he ensured that he became &quot;the apostle of liberalism&quot;.

Mackintosh wrote to Burke on 22 December 1796, saying that &quot;From the earliest moments of reflexion your writings were my chief study and delight...The enthusiasm with which I then embraced them is now ripened into solid Conviction by the experience and meditation of more mature age. For a time indeed seduced by the love of what I thought liberty I ventured to oppose your Opinions without ever ceasing to venerate your character...I cannot say...that I can even now assent to all your opinions on the present politics of Europe. But I can with truth affirm that I subscribe to your general Principles; that I consider them as the only solid foundation both of political Science and of political prudence&quot;. Burke replied that &quot;As it is on all hands allowed that you were the most able advocate for the cause which you supported, your sacrifice to truth and mature reflexion, adds much to your glory&quot;. However, in private Burke was sceptical of what he considered Mackintosh&#x27;s &quot;supposed conversion&quot;. Burke invited Mackintosh to spend Christmas with him at his home in Beaconsfield, where he was struck by Burke&#x27;s &quot;astonishing effusions of his mind in conversation. Perfectly free from all taint of affectation...Minutely and accurately informed, to a wonderful exactness, with respect to every fact relative to the French Revolution&quot;.

When Mackintosh visited Paris in 1802 during the Peace of Amiens, he responded to compliments from French admirers of his defence of their revolution by saying: &quot;Messieurs, vous m’avez si bien refuté&quot;.

==Lawyer==

As a lawyer his greatest public efforts were his lectures (1799) at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn on the law of nature and nations, of which the introductory discourse was published and ran to several editions; the resulting fame helped open doors for him later in life. Mackintosh was also famed for his speech in 1803 defending Jean Gabriel Peltier, a French refugee, against a libel suit instigated by Napoleon – then First Consul (military dictator) of France. Peltier had argued that Napoleon should be killed at a time when Britain and France were at peace. In front of an audience of ambassadors, it took only one minute for the jury to convict Jean-Gabriel, but the sentence was never applied as it was decidedly a political trial. J-G Peltier was no more satisfied with the judgment than Napoleon. 

The speech was widely published in English and also across Europe in a French translation by Madame de Staël, who became a friend of Mackintosh. In 1803, he was knighted.

==Judge of Bombay==

Upon being knighted, he was appointed Recorder (chief judge) of Bombay, taking up the post in 1804. Within a few months he had established the Bombay Literary Society at his home, where a circle of intellectuals and friends would meet to discuss the history, geography, zoology and botany of the sub-continent as well as its peoples and languages, customs and religions. The group would later evolve into the Asiatic Society of Mumbai.

He was however not at home in India, where he became ill, was disappointed by his literary progress with the mooted &quot;History of England&quot;, and was glad to leave for England in November 1811.

==Member of Parliament==

Mackintosh declined the offer of Spencer Perceval to resume political life under the wing of the dominant Tory party, despite prospects of office. He entered Parliament in July 1813 as a Whig. He was the member for Nairn until 1818, and afterwards for Knaresborough, till his death. 

In London society, and in Paris during his occasional visits, he was a recognized favourite. On Madame de Staël&#x27;s visit to London he was able to keep up in talk with her. A close friend was Richard Sharp MP, known as &quot;Conversation Sharp&quot;. and both men belonged to the Whig social group, the King of Clubs. 

Mackintosh&#x27;s parliamentary career was marked by his liberalism: he opposed reactionary measures of the Tory government; he supported and later succeeded Samuel Romilly in his efforts to reform the criminal code; and took a leading part both in Catholic emancipation and in the Reform Bill. His liberalism was, however, firmly Whiggish in orientation - alongside reformers like Thomas Babington Macaulay, Mackintosh was disdainful of the Utilitarian approach to reform, launching an attack on Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s &#x27;Plan of Parliamentary Reform&#x27; (1817) in the Edinburgh Review in 1818, and criticising the philosophy of human nature which underpinned the ideas of Bentham, James Mill, and other leading Utilitarians.

==Professor==

From 1818-24, he was professor of law and general politics in the East India Company&#x27;s College at Haileybury. While there, on 12 August 1823, Mackintosh wrote a two-sheet letter from Cadogan Place, London to James Savage asking for source material for Savage&#x27;s edition of &quot;The History of Taunton&quot; by Joshua Toulmin.

In the midst of the attractions of London society and of his parliamentary avocations Mackintosh felt that the real work of his life was being neglected. His great ambition was to write a history of England; he also cherished the idea of making some worthy contribution to philosophy. It was not till 1828 that he set about the first task of his literary ambition. 

This was his &quot;Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy&quot;, prefixed to the seventh edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. The dissertation, written mostly in ill-health and in snatches of time taken from his parliamentary engagements, was published in 1831. It was severely attacked in 1835 by James Mill in his &quot;Fragment on Mackintosh&quot;. About the same time he wrote for the &quot;Cabinet Cyclopaedia&quot; a &quot;History of England from the Earliest Times to the Final Establishment of the Reformation&quot;.

A privy councillor since 1828, Mackintosh was appointed Commissioner for the affairs of India under the Whig administration of 1830.

==&quot;History of the Revolution in England in 1688&quot;==
His history of the Glorious Revolution, for which he had done considerable research and collected a large amount of material, was not published till after his death. Mackintosh only completed it to the time of James II&#x27;s abdication. However his voluminous notes on the Glorious Revolution came into the possession of Thomas Babington Macaulay, who used them for his own &quot;History&quot; of the Revolution. Mackintosh&#x27;s notes stopped in the year of 1701, where Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; also ends.

Mackintosh&#x27;s work was published in 1834 and in his review of it, Macaulay said that he had &quot;no hesitation&quot; in proclaiming the book as &quot;decidedly the best history now extant of the reign of James the Second&quot; but lamented that &quot;there is perhaps too much disquisition and too little narrative&quot;. He went on to praise Mackintosh: &quot;We find in it the diligence, the accuracy, and the judgment of Hallam, united to the vivacity and the colouring of Southey. A history of England, written throughout in this manner, would be the most fascinating book in the language. It would be more in request at the circulating libraries than the last novel&quot;.

==Freemasonry==
He was Initiated into Scottish Freemasonry in Lodge Holyrood House (St. Luke&#x27;s), No.44, (Edinburgh) on 28 November 1785.

==Death==
Sir James Mackintosh died at home, 15 Langham Place, London at the age of 66. A chicken bone became stuck in his throat, causing a traumatic choking episode. The bone was removed, but he died a month later on 30 May 1832. He was buried in Hampstead on 4 June.

==Legacy==
A &quot;Life&quot;, by his son Robert James Mackintosh, was published in 1836. An edition of his works, in three volumes, (apart from the &quot;History of England&quot;) was published in 1846, containing his ethical and historical dissertations, a number of essays on political and literary topics, reviews, and other contributions to periodical publications, and speeches on a variety of subjects delivered at the bar and in parliament.

The Mackintosh River in Tasmania was named in his honour, by Henry Hellyer in November 1828.

==Family==
In 1789 Mackintosh married Catherine Stuart, whose brother Daniel later edited the &quot;Morning Post&quot;. His wife&#x27;s prudence counteracted Mackintosh&#x27;s own unpractical temperament, and his efforts in journalism became fairly profitable. They had a son, who died in infancy, and three daughters:

* Mary Mackintosh (1789–1876) married Claudius James Rich
* Maitland Mackintosh (1792–1861), married William Erskine
* Catherine Mackintosh (1795-18??) married Sir William Wiseman, 7th Baronet (1794–1845), and was the mother of Sir William Wiseman, 8th Baronet.

In 1797 Catherine died, and next year Mackintosh married Catherine Allen (died 6 May 1830), sister-in-law of Josiah II and John Wedgwood, through whom he introduced Samuel Taylor Coleridge to the &quot;Morning Post&quot;. They had two sons, one of whom died in infancy, and two daughters:

* Frances Emma Elizabeth Mackintosh (Fanny) (1800–1889), married Hensleigh Wedgwood.
* Robert Mackintosh (1803), died in infancy.
* Bessy Mackintosh (1804–1823)
* Robert James Mackintosh (1806–1864), colonial governor.

<doc id="205521" wikidata="Q1142887" url="?curid=205521" title="In Cold Blood">
<text>In Cold Blood is a non-fiction novel by the American author Truman Capote, first published in 1966. It details the 1959 Clutter family murders in the small farming community of Holcomb, Kansas.

Capote learned of the quadruple murder before the killers were captured, and he traveled to Kansas to write about the crime. He was accompanied by his childhood friend and fellow author Harper Lee, and they interviewed residents and investigators assigned to the case and took thousands of pages of notes. The killers, Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, were arrested six weeks after the murders and later executed by the state of Kansas. Capote ultimately spent six years working on the book.

&quot;In Cold Blood&quot; was an instant critical and commercial success. Considered by many to be the prototypical true crime novel, it is also the second-best-selling book in the genre&#x27;s history, behind Vincent Bugliosi&#x27;s &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; (1974) about the Charles Manson murders. Some critics also consider Capote&#x27;s work the original non-fiction novel, although other writers had already explored the genre, such as Rodolfo Walsh in &quot;Operación Masacre&quot; (1957). &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; has been lauded for its eloquent prose, extensive detail, and triple narrative which describes the lives of the murderers, the victims, and other members of the rural community in alternating sequences. The psychologies and backgrounds of Hickock and Smith are given special attention, as is the pair&#x27;s complex relationship during and after the murders. &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; is regarded by critics as a pioneering work in the true-crime genre, although Capote was disappointed that the book failed to win the Pulitzer Prize. Parts of the book differ from the real events, including important details.

== Crime ==


Herbert &quot;Herb&quot; Clutter was a prosperous farmer in western Kansas. He employed as many as 18 farmhands, who admired and respected him for his fair treatment and good wages. His two elder daughters, Eveanna and Beverly, had moved out and started their adult lives; his two younger children, daughter Nancy, 16, and son Kenyon, 15, were in high school. Clutter&#x27;s wife Bonnie had reportedly been incapacitated by clinical depression and physical ailments since the births of her children, although this was later disputed by her brother and other family members, who maintained that Bonnie&#x27;s depression was not as debilitating as portrayed in the book.

Two ex-convicts recently paroled from the Kansas State Penitentiary, Richard Eugene &quot;Dick&quot; Hickock and Perry Edward Smith, robbed and murdered Herb, Bonnie, Nancy, and Kenyon in the early morning hours of November 15, 1959. A former cellmate of Hickock&#x27;s, Floyd Wells, had worked for Herb Clutter and told Hickock that Clutter kept large amounts of cash in a safe. Hickock soon hatched the idea to steal the safe and start a new life in Mexico. According to Capote, Hickock described his plan as &quot;a cinch, the perfect score.&quot; Hickock later contacted Smith, another former cellmate, about committing the robbery with him. In fact, Herb Clutter had no safe and transacted essentially all of his business by check.

After driving more than 400 miles across the state of Kansas on the evening of November 14, Hickock and Smith arrived in Holcomb, located the Clutter home, and entered through an unlocked door while the family slept. Upon rousing the Clutters and discovering there was no safe, they bound and gagged the family, and continued to search for money, but found little of value in the house. Still determined to leave no witnesses, the pair briefly debated what to do; Smith, notoriously unstable and prone to violent acts in fits of rage, slit Herb Clutter&#x27;s throat and then shot him in the head. Capote writes that Smith recounted later, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to harm the man. I thought he was a very nice gentleman. Soft-spoken. I thought so right up to the moment I cut his throat.&quot; Kenyon, Nancy, and then Mrs. Clutter were also murdered, each by a single shotgun blast to the head. Hickock and Smith left the crime scene with a small portable radio, a pair of binoculars, and less than $50 () in cash.

Smith later claimed in his oral confession that Hickock murdered the two women. When asked to sign his confession, however, Smith refused. According to Capote, he wanted to accept responsibility for all four killings because, he said, he was &quot;sorry for Dick&#x27;s mother.&quot; Smith added, &quot;She&#x27;s a real sweet person.&quot; Hickock always maintained that Smith committed all four killings.

==Investigation and trial==

On the basis of a tip from Wells, who contacted the prison warden after hearing of the murders, Hickock and Smith were identified as suspects and arrested in Las Vegas on December 30, 1959. Both men eventually confessed after interrogations by detectives of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation.

They were brought back to Kansas, where they were tried together at the Finney County courthouse in Garden City, Kansas, from March 22 to 29, 1960. They both pleaded temporary insanity at the trial, but local general practitioners evaluated the accused and pronounced them sane.

Hickock and Smith are also suspected of involvement in the Walker family murders, which is mentioned in the book, although this connection has not been proven. A defense motion that Smith and Hickock undergo comprehensive psychological testing was denied; instead, three local general practitioners were appointed to examine them to determine whether they were sane at the time of the crime.

After only a short interview the doctors determined the defendants were not insane and were capable of being tried under M&#x27;Naghten rules. Defense lawyers sought the opinion of an experienced psychiatrist from the state&#x27;s local mental hospital, who diagnosed definite signs of mental illness in Smith and felt that previous injuries to Hickock&#x27;s head could have affected his behavior. This opinion was not admitted in the trial, however, because under Kansas law the psychiatrist could only opine on the defendant&#x27;s sanity at the time of the crime.

The jury deliberated for only 45 minutes before finding both Hickock and Smith guilty of murder. Their convictions carried a mandatory death sentence at the time. On appeal, Smith and Hickock contested the determinations that they were sane, and asserted that media coverage of the crime and trial had biased the jury, and that they had received inadequate assistance from their attorneys. Aspects of these appeals were submitted three times to the United States Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case.

After five years on death row at the Kansas State Penitentiary, Smith and Hickock were executed by hanging on April 14, 1965. Hickock was executed first and was pronounced dead at 12:41 a.m. after hanging for nearly 20 minutes. Smith followed shortly afterward and was pronounced dead at 1:19 a.m.

== Coverage and public discussion ==
During the first few months of their trial and afterward, Hickock and Smith&#x27;s murder case went unnoticed by most Americans. It was not until months before their executions that they became &quot;two of the most famous murderers in history.&quot; On 18 January 1960, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published &quot;Kansas: The Killers&quot;, a story about the murders. Inspired by that article, Truman Capote wrote, in 1965 serialized in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and in 1966 published, as a &quot;non-fiction novel&quot;, &quot;In Cold Blood,&quot; a true-crime book that detailed the murders and trial. Due to the brutality and severity of the crimes, the trial was covered nationwide, and even received some coverage internationally.

The notoriety of the murders and subsequent trial brought lasting effects to the small Kansas town, and Capote became so famous and related to trials that he was called to help the Senate in an examination of the court case. The trial also brought into the national spotlight a discussion about the death penalty and mental illness. Capote expressed that after completing the book and interviewing Hickock and Smith, he opposed the death penalty.

This trial has also been cited as an example of &quot;the limitations of the M&#x27;Naghten rules (also called M&#x27;Naghten test).&quot; The M&#x27;Naghten rules are used to determine whether or not a criminal was insane at the time of their crime and therefore incapable of being tried fairly. Authors such as Karl Menninger strongly criticized the M&#x27;Naghten test, calling it absurd. Many &quot;lawyers, judges, and psychiatrists&quot; have sought to &quot;get around&quot; the M&#x27;Naghten rules. In &quot;Intention – Law and Society&quot;, James Marshall further criticizes the M&#x27;Naghten rules, calling into question the psychological principles upon which the rules are based. He stated that &quot;the M&#x27;Naghten rules ... are founded on an erroneous hypothesis that behavior is based exclusively on intellectual activity and capacity.&quot;

A 1966 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;neighborliness evaporated&quot; in the Holcomb community. &quot;The natural order seemed suspended. Chaos poised to rush in.&quot; In 2009, 50 years after the Clutter murders, the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; asked Kansas citizens about the effects of the trial, and their opinions of the book and subsequent movie and television series about the events. Many respondents said they had begun to lose their trust in others, &quot;doors were locked. Strangers eyed with suspicion.&quot; Many still felt greatly affected and believed Capote had in a way taken advantage of their &quot;great tragedy&quot;.

==Capote&#x27;s research==
Capote became interested in the murders after reading about them in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.
He brought his childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee (who would later win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;) to help gain the confidence of the locals in Kansas.

Capote did copious research for the book, ultimately compiling 8,000 pages of notes. His research also included letters from Smith&#x27;s Army buddy, Don Cullivan, who was present during the trial.

After the criminals were found, tried, and convicted, Capote conducted personal interviews with both Smith and Hickock. Smith especially fascinated Capote; in the book he is portrayed as the more sensitive of the two killers. The book was not completed until after Smith and Hickock were executed.

An alternative explanation for Capote&#x27;s interest holds that &quot;The New Yorker&quot; presented the Clutter story to him as one of two choices for a story; the other was to follow a Manhattan cleaning woman on her rounds. Capote supposedly chose the Clutter story, believing it would be the easier assignment. Capote later wrote a piece about following a cleaning woman, which he entitled &quot;A Day&#x27;s Work&quot; and included in his book &quot;Music for Chameleons&quot;.

Capote&#x27;s novel was unconventional for its time. New Journalism, as a genre and style of writing, developed during the time in which &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; was written and Capote became a pioneer in showing how it can be used effectively to create a unique non-fiction story. New Journalism is a style of writing by which the author writes the non-fiction novel or story while it is developing in real life. This is exactly what Capote did as he followed the court trials and interviewed those close to the Clutter family to create this story while it was unfolding in the real world. As a result, he simultaneously researched and wrote the story we now know as &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;.

==Veracity==
&quot;In Cold Blood&quot; brought Capote much praise from the literary community. However, some critics have questioned its veracity, arguing that Capote changed facts to suit the story, added scenes that never took place, and manufactured dialogue. Phillip K. Tompkins noted factual discrepancies in &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1966 after he traveled to Kansas and talked to some of the people whom Capote had interviewed. Josephine Meier was the wife of Finney County Undersheriff Wendle Meier, and she denied that she heard Smith cry or that she held his hand, as described by Capote. &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; indicates that Meier and Smith became close, yet she told Tompkins that she spent little time with Smith and did not talk much with him. Tompkins concluded:
True-crime writer Jack Olsen also commented on the fabrications:
His criticisms were quoted in &quot;Esquire&quot;, to which Capote replied, &quot;Jack Olsen is just jealous.&quot;

The prosecutor involved in the case, Duane West, claimed that the story lacked veracity because Capote failed to get the true hero right. Richard Rohlader took the photo showing that two culprits were involved, and West suggested that Rohlader was the one deserving the greatest praise. Without that picture, West believed, the crime might not have been solved. West had been a friend of Capote&#x27;s while he was writing the book, and had been invited by him to New York City to see &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, where he met Carol Channing after the show. Their relationship soured when Capote&#x27;s publisher attempted to get West to sign a non-compete agreement to prevent him from writing his own book about the murders. Despite a series of malicious rumors, Capote himself was never considered a suspect in the killings.

Alvin Dewey was the lead investigator portrayed in &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, and stated that the scene in which he visits the Clutters&#x27; graves was Capote&#x27;s invention. Other Kansas residents whom Capote interviewed later claimed that they or their relatives were mischaracterized or misquoted. Dewey said that the rest of the book was factually accurate, but further evidence indicates that it is not as &quot;immaculately factual&quot; as Capote had always claimed it to be. The book depicts Dewey as being the brilliant investigator who cracks the Clutter murder case, but files recovered from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation show that Floyd Wells came forward of his own volition to name Hickock and Smith as likely suspects; furthermore, Dewey did not immediately act on the information, as the book portrays him doing, because he still believed that the murders were committed by locals who &quot;had a grudge against Herb Clutter&quot;.

Ronald Nye, the son of former Kansas Bureau of Investigation Director Harold R. Nye, collaborated with author Gary McAvoy in disclosing parts of his father&#x27;s personal investigative notebooks which challenged the veracity of &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;. Their book, &quot;And Every Word is True&quot;, lays out previously unknown facts of the investigation, and suggests that Herbert Clutter&#x27;s death may have been a murder-for-hire plot which involved a potential third suspect. However, McAvoy concedes that &quot;neither Hickock nor Smith mention any of this in their confessions, or in their defense at trial&quot;.

==Publication==
&quot;In Cold Blood&quot; was first published as a four-part serial in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, beginning with the September 25, 1965, issue. The piece was an immediate sensation, particularly in Kansas, where the usual number of &quot;New Yorker&quot; copies sold out immediately. &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; was first published in book form by Random House on January 17, 1966. 

The cover, which was designed by S. Neil Fujita, shows a hatpin with what appeared originally as a red drop of blood at its top end. After Capote first saw the design, he requested that the drop be made a deeper shade of red to represent the passage of time since the incident. A black border was added to the ominous image.

==Reviews and impact==
Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Conrad Knickerbocker praised Capote&#x27;s talent for detail throughout the novel and declared the book a &quot;masterpiece&quot;; an &quot;agonizing, terrible, possessed, proof that the times, so surfeited with disasters, are still capable of tragedy.&quot;

In a controversial review of the novel, published in 1966 for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Stanley Kauffmann, criticising Capote&#x27;s writing style throughout the novel, states that Capote &quot;demonstrates on almost every page that he is the most outrageously overrated stylist of our time&quot; and later asserts that &quot;the depth in this book is no deeper than its mine-shaft of factual detail; its height is rarely higher than that of good journalism and often falls below it.&quot;

Tom Wolfe wrote in his essay &quot;Pornoviolence&quot;: &quot;The book is neither a who-done-it nor a will-they-be-caught, since the answers to both questions are known from the outset ... Instead, the book&#x27;s suspense is based largely on a totally new idea in detective stories: the promise of gory details, and the withholding of them until the end.&quot;

In &quot;The Independent&quot;&#x27;s Book of a Lifetime series, reviewer Kate Colquhoun asserts that &quot;the book – for which he made a reputed 8000 pages of research notes – is plotted and structured with taut writerly flair. Its characters pulse with recognisable life; its places are palpable. Careful prose binds the reader to his unfolding story. Put simply, the book was conceived of journalism and born of a novelist.&quot;

==Adaptations==
Three film adaptations have been produced based upon the book. The first focuses on the details of the book, whereas the later two explore Capote&#x27;s fascination with researching the novel. &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; (1967) was directed by Richard Brooks and stars Robert Blake as Perry Smith and Scott Wilson as Richard Hickock. It features John Forsythe as investigator Alvin Dewey from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation who apprehended the killers. It was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Director, Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, and Best Adapted Screenplay.

The second and third films focus on Capote&#x27;s experiences in writing the story and his subsequent fascination with the murders. &quot;Capote&quot; (2005) stars Philip Seymour Hoffman, who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Truman Capote, Clifton Collins Jr. as Perry Smith, and Catherine Keener as Harper Lee. The film was critically acclaimed, won at the 78th Academy Awards for Best Actor (Hoffman), and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress (Keener), Best Director (Bennett Miller), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Dan Futterman). A year later, &quot;Infamous&quot; by Douglas McGrath was released. The film covered the same events as &quot;Capote&quot;, including Capote and Lee researching and writing “In Cold Blood”. In the 2006, film Toby Jones played Capote, Sandra Bullock played Harper Lee, Daniel Craig played Perry Smith and Sigourney Weaver appeared as Babe Paley.

J. T. Hunter&#x27;s novel &quot;In Colder Blood&quot; (2016) discusses Hickock and Smith&#x27;s possible involvement in the Walker family murders. Oni Press published Ande Parks and Chris Samnee&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Capote in Kansas&quot; (2005). Capote&#x27;s book was adapted by Benedict Fitzgerald into the two-part television miniseries &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; (1996), starring Anthony Edwards as Dick Hickock, Eric Roberts as Perry Smith, and Sam Neill as Alvin Dewey.

In 1995 the US composer Mikel Rouse released &quot;Failing Kansas&quot;, a one-person opera using live vocals and video that retells the story using transcripts and testimony from the original case as well as fragments of verse and songs by Robert W. Service, Thomas Gray and Perry Edward Smith.

<doc id="205522" wikidata="Q266611" url="?curid=205522" title="Ann Coulter">
<text>Ann Hart Coulter (; born December 8, 1961) is an American conservative media pundit, author, syndicated columnist, and lawyer. She became known as a media pundit in the late 1990s, appearing in print and on cable news as an outspoken critic of the Clinton administration. Her first book concerned the impeachment of Bill Clinton and sprang from her experience writing legal briefs for Paula Jones&#x27;s attorneys, as well as columns she wrote about the cases. Coulter&#x27;s syndicated column for Universal Press Syndicate appears in newspapers and is featured on conservative websites. Coulter has also written 13 books.

==Early life==

Ann Hart Coulter was born on December 8, 1961, in New York City, to John Vincent Coulter (1926–2008), an FBI agent from a working class Catholic Irish American and German American family in Albany, New York, and Nell Husbands Coulter (née Martin; 1928–2009), a homemaker who was born in Paducah, Kentucky.

Coulter&#x27;s mother&#x27;s ancestry has been traced back on both sides of her family to a group of Puritan settlers in Plymouth Colony, British America arriving on the &quot;Griffin&quot; with Thomas Hooker in 1633, and her father&#x27;s family were Catholic Irish and German immigrants who arrived in America in the 19th century. Her father&#x27;s Irish ancestors emigrated during the famine—and became ship laborers, tilemakers, brickmakers, carpenters and flagmen. Coulter&#x27;s father attended college on the GI Bill and later became an FBI agent.

She has two older brothers: James, an accountant, and John, an attorney. Her family later moved to New Canaan, Connecticut, where Coulter and her two brothers were raised. Coulter graduated from New Canaan High School in 1980.

While attending Cornell University, Coulter helped found &quot;The Cornell Review&quot;, and was a member of the Delta Gamma national sorority. She graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Cornell in 1984 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and received her Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1988, where she was an editor of the &quot;Michigan Law Review&quot;. At Michigan, Coulter was president of the local chapter of the Federalist Society and was trained at the National Journalism Center.

Coulter&#x27;s age was disputed in 2002. While she argued that she was not yet 40, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; columnist Lloyd Grove cited a birthdate of December 8, 1961, which Coulter provided when registering to vote in New Canaan, Connecticut, prior to the 1980 Presidential election, for which she had to be 18 years old to register. A driver&#x27;s license issued several years later purportedly listed her birthdate as December 8, 1963. Coulter has not confirmed either date, citing privacy concerns.

==Career==
After law school, Coulter served as a law clerk in Kansas City for Judge Pasco Bowman II of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. After a short time working in New York City in private practice, where she specialized in corporate law, Coulter left to work for the United States Senate Judiciary Committee after the Republican Party took control of Congress in 1994. She handled crime and immigration issues for Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan and helped craft legislation designed to expedite the deportation of aliens convicted of felonies. She later became a litigator with the Center for Individual Rights.

Coulter has written 13 books, and also publishes a syndicated newspaper column. She is particularly known for her polemical style, and describes herself as someone who likes to &quot;stir up the pot. I don&#x27;t pretend to be impartial or balanced, as broadcasters do&quot;.
She idolized Clare Boothe Luce for her satirical style. She also makes numerous public appearances, speaking on television and radio talk shows, as well as on college campuses, receiving both praise and protest. Coulter typically spends 6 to 12 weeks of the year on speaking engagement tours, and more when she has a book coming out.
In 2010, she made an estimated $500,000 on the speaking circuit, giving speeches on topics of modern conservatism, gay marriage, and what she describes as the hypocrisy of modern American liberalism. During one appearance at the University of Arizona, a pie was thrown at her. In defense of her ideas, Coulter has on occasion responded with inflammatory remarks toward hecklers and protestors who attend her speeches.

===Books===
Coulter has authored twelve books, including many that have appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, with a combined 3 million copies sold .

Coulter&#x27;s first book, &quot;High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton&quot;, was published by Regnery Publishing in 1998 and made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Bestseller list. It details Coulter&#x27;s case for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.

Her second book, &quot;&quot;, published by Crown Forum in 2002, reached the number one spot on &quot;The New York Times&quot; non-fiction best seller list. In &quot;Slander&quot;, Coulter argues that President George W. Bush was given unfair negative media coverage. The factual accuracy of &quot;Slander&quot; was called into question by then-comedian and author, later Democratic U.S. Senator from Minnesota, Al Franken; he also accused her of citing passages out of context. Others investigated these charges, and also raised questions about the book&#x27;s accuracy and presentation of facts. Coulter responded to criticisms in a column called &quot;Answering My Critics&quot;.

In her third book, &quot;Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism&quot;, also published by Crown Forum, she reexamines the 60-year history of the Cold War—including the career of Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Whittaker Chambers-Alger Hiss affair, and Ronald Reagan&#x27;s challenge to Mikhail Gorbachev to &quot;tear down this wall&quot;—and argues that liberals were wrong in their Cold War political analyses and policy decisions, and that McCarthy was correct about Soviet agents working for the U.S. government.
She also argues that the correct identification of Annie Lee Moss, among others, as communists was misreported by the liberal media.
&quot;Treason&quot; was published in 2003, and spent 13 weeks on the Best Seller list.

Crown Forum published a collection of Coulter&#x27;s columns in 2004 as her fourth book, &quot;How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must): The World According to Ann Coulter&quot;.

Coulter&#x27;s fifth book, published by Crown Forum in 2006, is &quot;&quot;.
In it, she argues, first, that American liberalism rejects the idea of God and reviles people of faith, and second, that it bears all the attributes of a religion itself.
&quot;Godless&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

Coulter&#x27;s &quot;If Democrats Had Any Brains, They&#x27;d Be Republicans&quot; (Crown Forum), published in October 2007, and &quot;&quot; (Crown Forum), published on January 6, 2009, both also achieved best-seller status.

On June 7, 2011, Crown Forum published her eighth book &quot;Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America&quot;.

Her ninth book, published September 25, 2012, was &quot;&quot;. It argues that liberals, and Democrats in particular, have taken undue credit for racial civil rights in America.

Coulter&#x27;s tenth book, &quot;Never Trust a Liberal Over 3 – Especially a Republican&quot;, was released on October 14, 2013. It is her second collection of columns and her first published by Regnery since her first book, &quot;High Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;. Coulter published her eleventh book, &quot;Adios, America: The Left&#x27;s Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole&quot;, on June 1, 2015. The book addresses illegal immigration, amnesty programs, and border security in the United States.

===Columns===
In the late 1990s, Coulter&#x27;s weekly (biweekly from 1999 to 2000) syndicated column for Universal Press Syndicate began appearing. Her column is featured on six conservative websites: &quot;Human Events Online&quot;, WorldNetDaily, Townhall.com, VDARE, &quot;FrontPage Magazine&quot;, &quot;Jewish World Review&quot; and her own website. Her syndicator says, &quot;Ann&#x27;s client newspapers stick with her because she has a loyal fan base of conservative readers who look forward to reading her columns in their local newspapers&quot;.

In 1999, Coulter worked as a columnist for &quot;George&quot; magazine. Coulter also wrote weekly columns for the conservative magazine &quot;Human Events&quot; between 1998 and 2003, with occasional columns thereafter. In her columns, she discussed judicial rulings, constitutional issues, and legal matters affecting Congress and the executive branch.

In 2001, as a contributing editor and syndicated columnist for &quot;National Review Online&quot; (NRO), Coulter was asked by editors to make changes to a piece written after the September 11 attacks. On the show &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, Coulter accused &quot;NRO&quot; of censorship and said she was paid $5 per article. &quot;NRO&quot; dropped her column and terminated her editorship. Jonah Goldberg, the editor-at-large of &quot;NRO&quot;, said: &quot;We did not &#x27;fire&#x27; Ann for what she wrote... we ended the relationship because she behaved with a total lack of professionalism, friendship, and loyalty [concerning the editing disagreement].&quot;

In August 2005, the &quot;Arizona Daily Star&quot; dropped Coulter&#x27;s syndicated column, citing reader complaints: &quot;Many readers find her shrill, bombastic, and mean-spirited. And those are the words used by readers who identified themselves as conservatives&quot;.

In July 2006, some newspapers replaced Coulter&#x27;s column with those of other conservative columnists following the publication of her fourth book, &quot;&quot;. After &quot;The Augusta Chronicle&quot; dropped her column, newspaper editor Michael Ryan said: &quot;it came to the point where she was the issue rather than what she was writing about.&quot; Ryan added that he continued himself &quot;to be an Ann Coulter fan&quot; as &quot;her logic is devastating and her viewpoint is right most of the time.&quot;

===Television and radio===

Coulter made her first national media appearance in 1996 after she was hired by the then-fledgling network MSNBC as a legal correspondent. She later appeared on CNN and Fox News, and went on to make frequent guest appearances on many television and radio talk shows.

== Political views ==

Ann Coulter is a conservative columnist and, as a member of the Federalist Society, is a staunch advocate federalism, originalism states&#x27; rights and textualism. In 2003, described herself as a &quot;typical, immodest-dressing, swarthy male-loving, friend-to-homosexuals, ultra-conservative.&quot; She is a registered Republican and former member of the advisory council of GOProud since August 9, 2011. When Milo Yiannopoulos initially defended pederasty, Coulter commented, &quot;Well, Milo learned HIS lesson. Pederasty acceptable only for refugees and illegals. Then libs will support you.&quot;

=== Abortion ===
Coulter supported the &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; ruling, which overturned the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; precedent, because she does not believe in a right to privacy. She believes abortion is a states&#x27; rights issue and opposes federal government regulating both for and against abortion. She describes herself as an &quot;anti-abortion zealot&quot;. She said banning most abortions after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy as &quot;shockingly reasonable&quot;. She believes abortion, excluding abortion exceptions in cases of fetal impairment, rape and danger to a woman&#x27;s life or health, should be illegal in most other cases.

=== Christianity ===
Coulter is a Presbyterian. Coulter was raised by a Catholic father and Protestant mother. At one public lecture she said: &quot;I don&#x27;t care about anything else; Christ died for my sins, and nothing else matters.&quot;

Confronting some critics&#x27; views that her content and style of writing is unchristian, Coulter said that she is &quot;a Christian first and a mean-spirited, bigoted conservative second, and don&#x27;t you ever forget it.&quot; Six years later, in 2011, she also said &quot;Christianity fuels everything I write.&quot;

===Evolution===
Coulter advocates teaching intelligent design, a pseudoscientific anti-evolution ideology, alongside evolution. In &quot;&quot;, Coulter characterized the theory of evolution as bogus science, and contrasted her beliefs to what she called the left&#x27;s &quot;obsession with Darwinism and the Darwinian view of the world, which replaces sanctification of life with sanctification of sex and death&quot;.

===Federalism===
Ann Coulter supports, regardless of her own personal position on the issue, a federalist states&#x27; rights position on abortion, affirmative action, cannabis legalization, capital punishment, contraception, criminal justice reform, education, environmental regulations, gun control, hate crime laws, healthcare, labor laws, minimum wage, religious displays on public buildings, prostitution, right-to-work laws, same-sex marriage, sodomy laws, state preemption laws, state religion, voting rights, and welfare.

=== Civil liberties ===
Coulter endorsed the NSA&#x27;s Terrorist Surveillance Program directed at Al-Qaeda. During a 2011 appearance on &quot;Stossel&quot;, she said &quot;PATRIOT Act, fantastic, Gitmo, fantastic, waterboarding, not bad, though torture would&#x27;ve been better.&quot; She criticized Rand Paul for &quot;this anti-drone stuff&quot;.

Coulter opposes hate crime laws, calling them &quot;unconstitutional&quot;. She also stated that &quot;Hate-crime provisions seem vaguely directed at capturing a sense of cold-bloodedness, but the law can do that without elevating some victims over others.&quot;

===Civil rights===
Although Coulter supported the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling, she is critical of desegregation busing, which she calls &quot;forced busing&quot; and desegregation court rulings since &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. She supports literacy tests for voting, which she claims are not unconstitutional or prohibited in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. She supports the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

===Women&#x27;s rights===
Coulter rejects &quot;the academic convention of euphemism and circumlocution&quot;, and is claimed to play to misogyny in order to further her goals; she &quot;dominates without threatening (at least not straight men)&quot;. Feminist critics also reject Coulter&#x27;s opinion that the gains made by women have gone so far as to create an anti-male society and her call for women to be rejected from the military because they are more vicious than men. Like the late anti-feminist Phyllis Schlafly, Coulter uses traditionally masculine rhetoric as reasoning for the need for traditional gender roles, and she carries this idea of feminized dependency into her governmental policies, according to feminist critics.

Coulter said in 2021 that women should not be allowed to vote.

=== Immigration ===
Coulter has criticized former president George W. Bush&#x27;s immigration proposals. In a 2007 column, she claimed that the current immigration system was set up to deliberately reduce the percentage of whites in the population.

Coulter opposes the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. She strongly opposed amnesty for undocumented immigrants, and at the 2013 CPAC said she had become &quot;a single-issue voter against amnesty&quot;.

In June 2018, during the controversy caused by the Trump administration family separation policy, Coulter dismissed immigrant children as &quot;child actors weeping and crying&quot; and urged Trump not to &quot;fall for it&quot;.

Coulter is an advocate of the white genocide conspiracy theory. She has compared non-white immigration into the United States with genocide, and claiming that &quot;a genocide&quot; is occurring against South African farmers, she has said that the Boers are the &quot;only real refugees&quot; in South Africa. Regarding domestic politics, &quot;Vox&quot; labelled Coulter as one of many providing a voice for &quot;the &#x27;white genocide&#x27; myth&quot;, and the SPLC covered Coulter&#x27;s remarks that if the demographic changes occurring in the U.S. were being &quot;legally imposed on any group other than white Americans, it would be called genocide&quot;.

=== LGBT rights ===
Since the 1990s, Coulter has had many acquaintances in the LGBT community. She describes herself as &quot;the Judy Garland of the Right&quot;, reflecting Garland&#x27;s large fan base from the gay community. In the last few years before 2015 she attracted LGBT fans, namely gay men and drag queens.

Coulter opposes same-sex marriage, opposes &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, and supports, after previously saying she did not, a federal U.S. constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union of one man and one woman. She claims her opposition to same-sex marriage &quot;wasn&#x27;t an anti-gay thing&quot; and that &quot;It&#x27;s genuinely a pro-marriage position to oppose gay marriage&quot;. Coulter claims that same-sex marriage would &quot;ruin gay culture&quot;, because &quot;gays value promiscuous sex over monogamy&quot;.

In an October 2003 C-SPAN debate, Coulter said there was nothing in the US Constitution about same-sex marriage and that she did not think she had taken a position yet on the issue of same-sex marriage. When asked, hypothetically, as Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) judge, if she would overturn a state statutorily legalizing same-sex marriage, she said she would not. When asked if she would support a federal U.S. constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union of one man and one woman, she said, as she when it first came up, she did not because she thought it was pointless as SCOTUS wasn&#x27;t correctly interpreting the constitution as it is according to her. On November 18, 2003, the day &quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot; was decided, she began helping to launch a national effort to amend the U.S. Constitution to prevent same-marriage.

Coulter also opposes civil unions and privatizing marriage. When addressed with the issue of rights granted by marriage, she said, &quot;Gays already can visit loved ones in hospitals. They can also visit neighbors, random acquaintances, and total strangers in hospitals—just like everyone else. Gays can also pass on property to whomever they would like.&quot; She also stated that same-sex sexual intercourse was already protected under the Fourth Amendment, which prevents police from going into your home without a search warrant or court order.

Coulter disagreed with repealing Don&#x27;t Ask Don&#x27;t Tell, stating that it is not an &quot;anti-gay position; it is a pro-military position&quot; because &quot;sexual bonds are disruptive to the military bond&quot;. She also stated that there is &quot;no proof that all the discharges for homosexuality involve actual homosexuals.&quot;

Coulter has expressed her opposition to treatment of LGBT people in the countries of Cuba, China, and Saudi Arabia.

At the 2007 CPAC, Coulter said, &quot;I do want to point out one thing that has been driving me crazy with the media—how they keep describing Mitt Romney&#x27;s position as being pro-gays, and that&#x27;s going to upset the right wingers&quot;, and &quot;Well, you know, screw you! I&#x27;m not anti-gay. We&#x27;re against gay marriage. I don&#x27;t want gays to be discriminated against.&quot; She added, &quot;I don&#x27;t know why all gays aren&#x27;t Republican. I think we have the pro-gay positions, which is anti-crime and for tax cuts. Gays make a lot of money and they&#x27;re victims of crime. No, they are! They should be with us.&quot;

In Coulter&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;If Democrats Had Any Brains, They&#x27;d Be Republicans&quot;, in the chapter &quot;Gays: No Gay Left Behind!&quot;, she argued that Republican policies were more pro-gay than Democratic policies. Coulter attended the 2010 HomoCon of GOProud, where she gave a speech about why gays should oppose same-sex marriage.

At the 2011 CPAC, during her question-and-answer segment, Coulter was asked about GOProud and the controversy over their inclusion at the 2011 CPAC. She boasted how she talked GOProud into dropping its support for same-sex marriage in the party&#x27;s platform, saying, &quot;The left is trying to co-opt gays, and I don&#x27;t think we should let them. I think they should be on our side&quot;, and &quot;Gays are natural conservatives&quot;. Later that year, she joined advisory board for GOProud. On Logo&#x27;s The A-List: Dallas she told gay Republican Taylor Garrett that &quot;The gays have got to be pro-life&quot;, and &quot;As soon as they find the gay gene, guess who the liberal yuppies are gonna start aborting?&quot;

=== War on Drugs ===
Coulter strongly supports continuing the War on Drugs. However, she has said that, if there were not a welfare state, she &quot;wouldn&#x27;t care&quot; if drugs were legal. She spoke about drugs as a guest on &quot;Piers Morgan Live&quot;, where she said that marijuana users &quot;can&#x27;t perform daily functions&quot;.

=== Bernie Sanders ===
In April 2019, Coulter said of Senator Bernie Sanders she would vote and perhaps even work for him in the 2020 U.S. presidential election if he stuck to his &quot;original position&quot; on U.S. border policy. &quot;If he went back to his original position, which is the pro blue-collar position—I mean, it totally makes sense with him&quot;, and &quot;If he went back to that position, I&#x27;d vote for him, I might work for him. I don&#x27;t care about the rest of the socialist stuff. Just, can we do something for ordinary Americans?&quot;

==Political activities and commentary==

Ann Coulter has described herself as a &quot;polemicist&quot; who likes to &quot;stir up the pot&quot; and does not &quot;pretend to be impartial or balanced, as broadcasters do&quot;. While her political activities in the past have included advising a plaintiff suing President Bill Clinton as well as considering a run for Congress, she mostly serves as a political pundit, sometimes creating controversy ranging from rowdy uprisings at some of the colleges where she speaks to protracted discussions in the media.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s John Cloud once observed that Coulter &quot;likes to shock reporters by wondering aloud whether America might be better off if women lost the right to vote&quot;. This was in reference to her statement that &quot;it would be a much better country if women did not vote. That is simply a fact. In fact, in every presidential election since 1950—except Goldwater in &#x27;64—the Republican would have won, if only the men had voted.&quot; Similarly, in an October 2007 interview with &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, Coulter said:
Coulter has also appeared on Fox News and advocated for a poll tax and a literacy test for voters (this was in 1999, and she reiterated her support of a literacy test in 2015).

===Paula Jones – Bill Clinton case===
Coulter first became a public figure shortly before becoming an unpaid legal adviser for the attorneys representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment suit against President Bill Clinton. Coulter&#x27;s friend George Conway had been asked to assist Jones&#x27; attorneys, and shortly afterward Coulter, who wrote a column about the Paula Jones case for &quot;Human Events&quot;, was also asked to help, and she began writing legal briefs for the case.

Coulter later stated that she would come to mistrust the motives of Jones&#x27; head lawyer, Joseph Cammaratta, who by August or September 1997 was advising Jones that her case was weak and to settle, if a favorable settlement could be negotiated. From the outset, Jones had sought an apology from Clinton at least as eagerly as she sought a settlement. However, in a later interview Coulter recounted that she herself had believed that the case was strong, that Jones was telling the truth, that Clinton should be held publicly accountable for his misconduct, and that a settlement would give the impression that Jones was merely interested in extorting money from the President.

David Daley, who wrote the interview piece for &quot;The Hartford Courant&quot; recounted what followed:

In his book, Isikoff also reported Coulter as saying: &quot;We were terrified that Jones would settle. It was contrary to our purpose of bringing down the President.&quot; After the book came out, Coulter clarified her stated motives, saying:

The case went to court after Jones broke with Coulter and her original legal team, and it was dismissed via summary judgment. The judge ruled that even if her allegations proved true, Jones did not show that she had suffered any damages, stating, &quot;... plaintiff has not demonstrated any tangible job detriment or adverse employment action for her refusal to submit to the governor&#x27;s alleged advances. The president is therefore entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff&#x27;s claim of quid pro quo sexual harassment.&quot; The ruling was appealed by Jones&#x27; lawyers. During the pendency of the appeal, Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000 ($151,000 after legal fees) in November 1998, in exchange for Jones&#x27; dismissal of the appeal. By then, the Jones lawsuit had given way to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.

In October 2000, Jones revealed that she would pose for nude pictures in an adult magazine, saying she wanted to use the money to pay taxes and support her grade-school-aged children, in particular saying, &quot;I&#x27;m wanting to put them through college and maybe set up a college fund.&quot; Coulter publicly denounced Jones, calling her &quot;the trailer-park trash they said she was&quot; (Coulter had earlier chastened Clinton supporters for calling Jones this name), after Clinton&#x27;s former campaign strategist James Carville had made the widely reported remark, &quot;Drag a $100 bill through a trailer park, and you&#x27;ll never know what you&#x27;ll find&quot;, and called Jones a &quot;fraud, at least to the extent of pretending to be an honorable and moral person&quot;.

Coulter wrote:
 Jones claimed not to have been offered any help with a book deal of her own or any other additional financial help after the lawsuit.

===Comments on Islam, Arabs, and terrorism===
Coulter&#x27;s September 14, 2001, column eulogized her friend Barbara Olson, killed three days earlier in the September 11 attacks, and ended with a call for war:
These comments resulted in Coulter being fired as a columnist by &quot;National Review&quot;, which she subsequently referred to as &quot;squeamish girly-boys&quot;. Responding to this comment, Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American–Islamic Relations remarked in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; that before September 11, Coulter &quot;would have faced swift repudiation from her colleagues&quot;, but &quot;now it&#x27;s accepted as legitimate commentary&quot;.

One day after the attacks (when death toll estimates were higher than later), Coulter asserted that only Muslims could have been behind them: &quot;Not all Muslims may be terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims—at least all terrorists capable of assembling a murderous plot against America that leaves 7,000 people dead in under two hours.&quot;

Coulter was highly critical in 2002 of the U.S. Department of Transportation and especially its then-secretary Norman Mineta. Her many criticisms include their refusal to use racial profiling as a component of passenger security screening. After a group of Muslims was expelled from a US Airways flight when other passengers expressed concern, sparking a call for Muslims to boycott the airline because of the ejection from a flight of six imams, Coulter wrote, &quot;If only we could get Muslims to boycott all airlines, we could dispense with airport security altogether.&quot;

Coulter also cited the 2002 Senate testimony of FBI whistleblower Coleen Rowley, who was acclaimed for condemning her superiors for refusing to authorize a search warrant for 9-11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui when he refused to consent to a search of his computer. They knew that he was a Muslim in flight school who had overstayed his visa, and the French Intelligence Service had confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups. Coulter said she agreed that probable cause existed in the case, but that refusing consent, being in flight school and overstaying a visa should not constitute grounds for a search. Citing a poll which found that 98 percent of Muslims between the ages of 20 and 45 said they would not fight for Britain in the war in Afghanistan, and that 48 percent said they would fight for Osama bin Laden she asserted &quot;any Muslim who has attended a mosque in Europe—certainly in England, where Moussaoui lived—has had &#x27;affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups,&#x27;&quot; so that she parsed Rowley&#x27;s position as meaning that probable cause&#x27; existed to search Moussaoui&#x27;s computer because he was a Muslim who had lived in England&quot;. Coulter says the poll was &quot;by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&quot;, actually it was by Sunrise, an &quot;Asian&quot; (therefore an Indian subcontinent-oriented) radio station, canvassing the opinions of 500 Muslims in Greater London (not Britain as a whole), mainly of Pakistani origin and aged between 20 and 45. Because &quot;FBI headquarters ... refused to engage in racial profiling&quot;, they failed to uncover the 9-11 plot, Coulter asserted. &quot;The FBI allowed thousands of Americans to be slaughtered on the altar of political correctness. What more do liberals want?&quot;

Coulter wrote in another column that she had reviewed the civil rights lawsuits against certain airlines to determine which of them had subjected Arabs to the most &quot;egregious discrimination&quot; so that she could fly only that airline. She also said that the airline should be bragging instead of denying any of the charges of discrimination brought against them. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; she said, &quot;I think airlines ought to start advertising: &#x27;We have the most civil rights lawsuits brought against us by Arabs.&#x27;&quot; When the interviewer, Jonathan Freedland, replied by asking what Muslims would do for travel, she responded, &quot;They could use flying carpets.&quot;

In the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing, Coulter told &quot;Hannity&quot; host Sean Hannity that the wife of bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev should be jailed for wearing a hijab. Coulter continued by saying &quot;Assimilating immigrants into our culture isn&#x27;t really working. They&#x27;re assimilating us into their culture.&quot;

===2013 CPAC Conference===
In March 2013, Coulter was one of the keynote speakers at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where she made references to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie&#x27;s weight (&quot;CPAC had to cut back on its speakers this year about 300 pounds&quot;) and progressive activist Sandra Fluke&#x27;s hairdo. (Coulter quipped that Fluke didn&#x27;t need birth control pills because &quot;that haircut is birth control enough&quot;.) Coulter advocated against a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants because such new citizens would never vote for Republican candidates: &quot;If amnesty goes through, America becomes California and no Republican will ever win another election.&quot;

===VDARE===
Since 2013, Coulter has been a contributor to VDARE, a far-right website and blog founded by anti-immigration activist and paleo-conservative Peter Brimelow. Michael Malice has said that &quot;Coulter and VDARE can be considered the furthest edge of the Overton Window&quot; as any political position further to the right would be too heretical to find mainstream success. VDARE is controversial because of its alleged white supremacist rhetoric and support of scientific racism and white nationalism.

== Candidate endorsements ==
Coulter initially supported George W. Bush&#x27;s presidency, but later criticized its approach to immigration. She endorsed Duncan Hunter and later Mitt Romney in the 2008 Republican presidential primaries and the 2012 Republican presidential primary and presidential run. In the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, she endorsed Donald Trump. Coulter later distanced herself from Trump following arguments over immigration policies; she called for his impeachment in September 2017, saying &quot;Put a fork in Trump, he&#x27;s dead&quot;. She described herself in 2018 as a &quot;former Trumper&quot;; in a 2020 speech to a Turning Point USA event, she said, &quot;The Trump agenda without Trump would be a lot easier. Our new motto should be &#x27;Going on with Trumpism without Trump.&#x27; That&#x27;s a winning strategy.&quot; Coulter blamed Trump&#x27;s son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner for Trump&#x27;s 2020 election loss, and said that Trump had failed to deliver for the white working class. In August 2024, Coulter spoke out against Donald Trump saying he was an &quot;awful, awful person.” However, she said she would vote for him in the 2024 election because she liked his running mate JD Vance and how we needed &quot;a wall on the border&quot;. &quot;Can’t trust Trump as far as I can throw him, but I do trust JD Vance to care about the left behind people”, Coulter said.

Other candidates Coulter has endorsed include Greg Brannon (2014 Republican primary candidate for North Carolina Senator), Paul Nehlen (2016 Republican primary candidate for Wisconsin&#x27;s 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives), Mo Brooks (2017 Republican primary candidate for Alabama Senator), and Roy Moore (2017 Republican candidate for Alabama Senator).

== Controversies ==

=== Anti-semitism accusations ===
Coulter was accused of antisemitism in an October 8, 2007, interview with Donny Deutsch on &quot;The Big Idea&quot;. During the interview, Coulter stated that the United States is a Christian nation, and said that she wants &quot;Jews to be perfected, as they say&quot; (referring to them being converted to Christianity). Deutsch, a practicing Jew, implied that this was an anti-semitic remark, but Coulter said she did not consider it to be a hateful comment. Coulter&#x27;s comments on the show were condemned by the Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Committee and Bradley Burston, and the National Jewish Democratic Council asked media outlets to cease inviting Coulter as a guest commentator. Talk show host Dennis Prager, while disagreeing with her comments, said that they were not &quot;anti-semitic&quot;, noting, &quot;There is nothing in what Ann Coulter said to a Jewish interviewer on CNBC that indicates she hates Jews or wishes them ill, or does damage to the Jewish people or the Jewish state. And if none of those criteria is present, how can someone be labeled anti-Semitic?&quot; Conservative activist David Horowitz also defended Coulter against the allegation.

Coulter in September 2015 tweeted in response to multiple candidates&#x27; references to Israel during a Republican presidential primary debate, &quot;How many f—ing Jews do these people think there are in the United States?&quot; The Anti-Defamation League referred to the tweets as &quot;ugly, spiteful and anti-Semitic&quot;. In response to accusations of anti-Semitism, she tweeted &quot;I like the Jews, I like fetuses, I like Reagan. Didn&#x27;t need to hear applause lines about them all night.&quot;

=== Plagiarism accusations ===
In October 2001, Coulter was accused of plagiarism for her 1998 book &quot;High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton&quot; by Michael Chapman, a columnist for the journal &quot;Human Events&quot; who claims that passages were taken from a supplement he wrote for the journal in 1997 titled &quot;A Case for Impeachment&quot;.

On the July 5, 2006, episode of &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; on MSNBC, guest John Barrie, the CEO of iParadigms, offered his professional opinion that Coulter plagiarized in her book &quot;Godless&quot; as well as in her columns over the previous year. Barrie ran &quot;Godless&quot; through iThenticate, his company&#x27;s machine, which is able to scan works and compare them to existing texts. He found a 25-word section of the text that was &quot;virtually word-for-word&quot; matched with a Planned Parenthood pamphlet and a 33-word section almost duplicating a 1999 article from the &quot;Portland Press&quot; as some examples of evidence. Barrie also said that it was &quot;very, very difficult to try to determine whether Ann Coulter was citing that material or whether she was just trying to pass it off&quot;.

Left-wing activist group Media Matters for America has appealed to Random House publishing to further investigate Coulter&#x27;s work. The syndicator of her columns cleared her of the plagiarism charges. Universal Press Syndicate and Crown Books also defended Coulter against the charges.
Columnist Bill Nemitz from the &quot;Portland Press Herald&quot; accused Coulter of plagiarizing a very specific sentence from his newspaper in her book &quot;Godless&quot;, but he also acknowledged that one sentence is insufficient grounds for filing suit.

===Cyberbullying===
In August 2024, Coulter received widespread criticism for a tweet with the comment &quot;Talk about weird ...&quot;, referring to Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz&#x27;s 17-year-old son, who has nonverbal learning disorder, crying during his father&#x27;s acceptance speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention. The tweet was deleted shortly after it was posted.

== In popular culture ==
Coulter was played by Cobie Smulders in &quot;&quot;; Betty Gilpin was originally cast in the role but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. The series portrays Coulter&#x27;s actions while assisting the prosecution in &quot;Clinton v. Jones&quot;, the precursor to Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.

Coulter was satirically depicted in season 2, episode 11 of &quot;The Boondocks&quot;—&quot;The S Word&quot;—where she voiced support for a white teacher in the show who said a racial slur.

== Personal life ==
Coulter has been engaged several times, but she has never married and has no children. After the September 11 attacks, she dated a Muslim boyfriend. She has dated &quot;Spin&quot; founder and publisher Bob Guccione Jr. and conservative writer Dinesh D&#x27;Souza. In October 2007, she began dating Andrew Stein, the former president of the New York City Council, a liberal Democrat. On January 7, 2008, however, Stein told the &quot;New York Post&quot; that the relationship was over, citing irreconcilable differences. In 2013 it was reported that Coulter was dating actor Jimmie Walker. Coulter responded to the rumors by saying &quot;He’s the one spreading that [dating] rumor! No, we’re great friends. We do a lot of stuff together. … He is so hilarious, so I see him a lot when I’m in L.A., but we are not technically dating.” In 2017, Norman Lear, who created the television sitcom &quot;Good Times&quot; in which Walker starred, said of Walker &quot;I love him; he’s a wonderful guy. But I’ll tell you something about him that’ll astound you: He dates Ann Coulter.” Coulter responded to Lear&#x27;s comments by saying &quot;This rumor spreads every now and then, but it’s never been true. We’re great friends. He’s hilarious and a Republican. Now, that’s news!”

Kellyanne Conway, who refers to Coulter as a friend, told &quot;New York&quot; magazine in 2017 that Coulter &quot;started dating her security guard probably ten years ago because she couldn&#x27;t see anybody else&quot;.

Coulter owns a house, bought in 2005, in Palm Beach, Florida, a condominium in Manhattan, and an apartment in Los Angeles. She votes in Palm Beach and is not registered to do so in New York or California.

<text>Eric Brown (24 May 1960 – 21 March 2023) was a British science fiction author and &quot;The Guardian&quot; critic.

== Biography ==
Eric Brown was born in Haworth, Yorkshire, in May 1960, and began writing in 1975. In the 1980s he travelled extensively throughout Greece and Asia (some of his novels are set in India). His first publication was in 1982, when his play for children &quot;Noel&#x27;s Ark&quot; appeared.

His career took off in the late 1980s with a succession of short stories in the magazine &quot;Interzone&quot; and other publications. His story &quot;The Time-Lapsed Man&quot; won the &quot;Interzone&quot; readers&#x27; poll for the most admired story of 1988, and an Eastercon short text award in 1995. He was voted the Best New European SF writer of the Year in the early 1990s and subsequently won the BSFA Award twice (for the short stories &quot;Hunting the Slarque&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Children of Winter&quot; in 2001).

Brown publicly admired the science fiction writing of Michael G. Coney, Robert Silverberg, Richard Paul Russo and Robert Charles Wilson, amongst others.

Brown died from sepsis on 21 March 2023, at the age of 62.

<doc id="205531" wikidata="Q3024627" url="?curid=205531" title="Editorial cartoonist">
<text>An editorial cartoonist, also known as a political cartoonist, is an artist who draws editorial cartoons that contain some level of political or social commentary. Their cartoons are used to convey and question an aspect of daily news or current affairs in a national or international context. Political cartoonists generally adopt a caricaturist style of drawing, to capture the likeness of a politician or subject. They may also employ humor or satire to ridicule an individual or group, emphasize their point of view or comment on a particular event.

Because an editorial cartoonist expresses an idea visually, with little or no text or words, it can be understood across many languages and countries. A strong tradition of editorial cartooning can be found throughout the world, in all political environments, including Cuba, Australia, Malaysia, Pakistan, India, Iran, France, Denmark, Canada and the United States.

== Overview ==
The traditional and most common outlet for political cartoonists is the pocket cartoon, which usually appears on the editorial page or the front news page of a newspaper. Editorial cartoons are not usually found in the dedicated comics section, although certain cartoons or comic strips (such as &quot;Doonesbury&quot;) have achieved crossover status.

In India, the most common and popular form of political commentary is the pocket cartoon. R. K. Laxman, Sudhir Dar, Mario Miranda, E. P. Unny, Shekhar Gurera, Ajit Ninan are some of the popular editorial cartoonists, through their daily pocket cartoons.

Editorial cartoonists may reflect the political opinion expressed on the editorial page, or a newspaper in general, but they can also express opposing views, or opt for more populist humor that often reflects the conventional wisdom of the readers.

Historically, the political cartoon has roots in ancient art forms such as prehistoric cave paintings or the hieroglyphs of Egypt, in terms of their role in informing society. Cartoonists in many ways take on the role of a court jester, who, though employed by a king or other ruler, would often mimic and ridicule him and his regime in his performances, to entertain the court or the common person.

==Media trends==
Historically, political cartoons were quick, hand-drawn ink drawings, scanned and reproduced in black and white, and published in print newspapers. The introduction of color came later, and more recently the use of digital drawing tools is a popular and efficient way to produce work quickly for newspaper deadlines.

In recent years, the Internet has become a popular means for distributing this kind of short format media, humor, and minority political opinions, leading to a large growth in the popularity of online and alternative editorial cartoons.

The rise of comics journalism online, which combines the longer comic strip format as a means to relay a story in more depth, is very effective in a vertical web format. As visual journalists, comics journalists can tell a story in a visual way, with words and images.

In the United States, there are more than a hundred published editorial cartoonists from both sides of the political divide. Whereas in the past American newspapers generally used to employ staff political cartoonists, nowadays, the work of many political cartoonists, are distributed via syndication services (such as Andrews McMeel Syndication, Cagle Cartoons, the Tribune Content Agency, King Features Syndicate, Creators Syndicate, and Counterpoint Media).

== Risks ==
A political cartoonist&#x27;s aim is often to encourage debate; they can also fuel controversy. Their work can expose corrupt or abusive regimes, governments or political groups, and therefore often put themselves and their publishers at risk.

In 2005, Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, who participated in the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, received numerous death threats and was attacked in his home by a man with an axe.

In 2015, the French satirical magazine &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot;″s offices were attacked by two Islamist gunmen in reaction to publishing cartoons of Muhammad. Twelve employees were killed, including staff cartoonists Charb, Cabu, Honoré, Tignous and Wolinski.

==Awards==
The Cartoonists Rights Network International awards the annual Courage in Editorial Cartooning Award to political cartoonists who show bravery and risk their own safety to publish their work. In 2015, this accolade was awarded to Atena Farghadani of Iran, who was jailed for more than 12 years for publishing a cartoon of Iran&#x27;s parliament with heads of various animals.

There is a Pulitzer Prize awarded every year for America&#x27;s top editorial cartoonist — as decided by a panel of senior media industry professionals and media academics (see Pulitzer Prize for Illustrated Reporting and Commentary). Other major awards given each year to editorial cartoonists include the Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists, the Thomas Nast Award from the Overseas Press Club, and the Herblock Prize.

==Organizations==
* Association of American Editorial Cartoonists (AAEC): The largest organization of political cartoonists, have over 300 members worldwide. 
* National Cartoonists Society (NCS): welcomes editorial cartoonists in the United States.
* Cartoonists Rights Network International (CRNI): It helps cartoonists who are exiled, jailed or in danger of persecution.
* Indian Institute of Cartoonists (IIC): The only organisation in India dedicated to the art of cartooning and regularly exhibit cartoons of various cartoonists

There are several North American books that have collected together the majority of cartoonists being published at the time. &quot;Attack of the Political Cartoonists&quot;, written by J. P. Trostle, was published in 2004 and includes profiles of 150 mainstream American and Canadian cartoonists. &quot;Attack&quot; was an effort to update the 1962 tome &quot;Today&#x27;s Cartoon&quot;, by &quot;New Orleans States-Item&quot; cartoonist John Chase, which included most of the editorial cartoonists working in the U.S. at the height of the Cold War. The 3-volume &quot;Attitude&quot; series includes some of the political cartoonists who have appeared in alternative newspapers and online — see &quot;&quot;.

There are also a number of North American annual collections published each year, including &quot;Best Editorial Cartoons of the Year&quot; from Pelican Publishing, &quot;Best Political Cartoons of the Year&quot; from Daryl Cagle, and Portfolio, which showcases the best Canadian cartoons of the year.

<text>Sir Thomas Henry Hall Caine (14 May 1853 – 31 August 1931), usually known as Hall Caine, was a British novelist, dramatist, short
story writer, poet and critic of the late 19th and early 20th century. Caine&#x27;s popularity during his lifetime was unprecedented. He wrote 15 novels on subjects of adultery, divorce, domestic violence, illegitimacy, infanticide, religious bigotry and women&#x27;s rights, became an international literary celebrity, and sold a total of ten million books. Caine was the most highly paid novelist of his day. &quot;The Eternal City&quot; is the first novel to have sold over a million copies worldwide. In addition to his books, Caine is the author of more than a dozen plays and was one of the most commercially successful dramatists of his time; many were West End and Broadway productions. Caine adapted seven of his novels for the stage. He collaborated with leading actors and managers, including Wilson Barrett, Viola Allen, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Louis Napoleon Parker, Mrs Patrick Campbell, George Alexander, and Arthur Collins. Most of Caine&#x27;s novels were adapted into silent black and white films. A. E. Coleby&#x27;s 1923 18,454 feet, nineteen-reel film &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; became the longest commercially made British film. Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1929 film &quot;The Manxman&quot;, is Hitchcock&#x27;s last silent film.
Born in Runcorn to a Manx father and Cumbrian mother, Caine was raised in Liverpool. After spending four years in school, Caine was trained as an architectural draughtsman. While growing up he spent childhood holidays with relatives in the Isle of Man. At seventeen he spent a year there as schoolmaster in Maughold. Afterwards he returned to Liverpool and began a career in journalism, becoming a leader-writer on the &quot;Liverpool Mercury&quot;. As a lecturer and theatre critic he developed a circle of eminent literary friends by whom he was influenced. Caine moved to London at Dante Gabriel Rossetti&#x27;s suggestion and lived with the poet, acting as secretary and companion during the last years of Rossetti&#x27;s life. Following the publication of his &quot;Recollections of Rossetti&quot; in 1882 Caine began his career as a writer spanning four decades.
Caine established his residency in the Isle of Man in 1895, where he sat from 1901 to 1908 in the Manx House of Keys, the lower house of its legislature. Caine was elected President of the Manx National Reform League in 1903 and chair of the Keys&#x27; Committee that prepared the 1907 petition for constitutional reform. In 1929
Caine was granted the Freedom of the Borough of Douglas, Isle of Man. Caine visited Russia in 1892 on behalf of the persecuted Jews. In 1895 Caine travelled in the United States and Canada, where he represented the Society of Authors conducting successful negotiations and obtaining important international copyright concessions from the Dominion Parliament.
During the Great War (1914–1918) Caine wrote many patriotic articles and edited &quot;King Albert&#x27;s Book&quot;, the proceeds of which went to help Belgian refugees. In 1917, Caine was created an Officer of the Order of Leopold by King Albert I of Belgium. Caine cancelled many literary contracts in America to devote all his time and energy to the British war effort. On the recommendation of the Prime Minister Lloyd George for services as an Allied propagandist in the United States, King George V made him a Knight Commander of the British Empire in 1918 and a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1922. Aged 78 Caine died in his home at Greeba Castle on the Isle of Man.

==Early life and influences==

===Early days===

Thomas Henry Hall Caine was born on 14 May 1853 at 29 Bridgewater Street, Runcorn, Cheshire, England, the eldest of six children of John Caine (1825–1904) and his wife Sarah Caine (née Hall, (1828–1912)). Sarah was born in Whitehaven, Cumberland, and descended from an old Quaker family of Ralph Halls, china manufacturer. After living for many years in Cumberland the Hall family moved to Liverpool where Sarah, a seamstress, met and married John. As her husband was a member of the Anglican Church and not a Quaker she lost her connection with the Society of Friends. Throughout her life she retained the Quaker simplicity of life and dress. John Caine, a blacksmith, came from the Isle of Man. In the absence of work he emigrated to Liverpool, where he trained as a shipsmith. At the time of Caine&#x27;s birth, he was working temporarily in Runcorn docks. Within a few months the family were back in Liverpool, where Caine spent his childhood and youth. They rented rooms at 14 Rhyl Street, Toxteth, convenient for Liverpool Docks and within a small Manx expat community. By 1858 they had moved to number 21. Early in 1862 they moved to 5 Brougham Street where Caine attended Windsor Street Wesleyan School, and in January 1865 the family moved round the corner to 2 Coburg Street.

During his childhood Caine was occasionally sent to stay with his grandmother, Isabella, and uncle, William, a butcher-farmer, in their thatched cottage at Ballaugh on the Isle of Man. His grandmother nicknamed him &#x27;Hommy-Beg&#x27;, Manx for &#x27;Little Tommy&#x27;. The island has a long history of folklore and superstition, passed from generation to generation. Continuing this tradition Grandmother Caine passed on her knowledge of local myths and legends to her grandson, telling him countless stories of fairies, witches, witch-doctors and the evil eye while they were sat by the fire.

When Caine was nine he lost two of his young sisters within a year. Five year old Sarah developed hydrocephaly after a fever. Fourteen month old Emma died in convulsions brought on by whooping cough she caught from him and his brother John. Caine was to be sent to the Isle of Man to recover from his illness and grief. He was put on a boat to Ramsey by his father, with a label pinned on his coat and assurances that his uncle would meet him. A fierce storm occurred preventing the ferry from reaching land. Caine was rescued by a large rowing boat. He later drew on this experience when writing the scene in &quot;The Bondman&quot; in which Stephen Orry is cast ashore there. Another sister, Lily Hall Caine, made it to adulthood and became a prominent stage actress. Lily died June 1, 1914.

The Caine family belonged to the Baptist Church in Myrtle Street, Liverpool, presided over by the charismatic Hugh Stowell Brown, a Manxman and brother of poet Thomas Edward Brown. Brown&#x27;s public lectures and work among the poor made him a household name in Liverpool. Caine participated in the literary and debating society Brown had established. While Caine was very young he became well known and highly regarded by the people of south Liverpool. There he was in great demand as a speaker, having the ability to engage an audience from his first word. Through studying the works of the Lake School of Poets, and the best writers of the eighteenth century, Caine combined this knowledge with his own ideas of perfection, and went on to develop his level of eloquence to oratory.

From the age of ten Caine was educated at Hope Street Unitarian Higher Grade School in Caledonia Street, Liverpool, becoming head boy in his last year there. Prior to this he attended St. James&#x27;s School and for several years afterwards continued his education attending evening classes at Queen&#x27;s College, Liverpool Institute. He spent many hours on his own avidly reading books, notably at Liverpool&#x27;s Free Library. Caine also experienced what he described as the &#x27;scribbling itch&#x27; for writing. He produced essays, poems, novels and overview histories with little thought of them being published.

In common with all 19th century towns Liverpool was unsanitary. In 1832 there had been a cholera epidemic. As panic and fear of this new and misunderstood disease spread, eight major riots had broken out on the streets along with several smaller uprisings. In 1849 a second epidemic occurred. When Caine was thirteen the third outbreak of cholera occurred in July 1866. Memories of that time were to stay with him, the deaths, the large volume of funerals and prayer meetings in open spaces that were happening all around him.

===Apprentice and schoolmaster===
At fifteen, after leaving school, he was apprenticed to John Murray, an architect and surveyor in Lord Street, Liverpool. Murray was a distant relative of William Ewart Gladstone. On 10 December 1868, the day of the general election when Gladstone was to be elected as Prime Minister, Caine was running to offices in Union Court, belonging to Gladstone&#x27;s brother, with telegrams announcing the results of the contests all over the country. Caine was breaking the news of great majorities before Gladstone had time to open his telegrams. Caine was to meet Gladstone on another occasion when he was on Gladstone&#x27;s estate at Seaforth House. The surveyor-in-chief had not appeared one morning and a fifteen year old Caine took his place. Caine had left a lasting impression on Gladstone, as two years later Caine had a letter from Gladstone&#x27;s brother saying the Prime Minister wished to appoint him steward of the Lancashire Gladstone estates. Caine declined the offer.

Caine&#x27;s maternal grandparents had lived with the rest of his family while they were growing up in Liverpool. His grandfather, Ralph Hall, died in January 1870, when Caine was seventeen. In the same year of his life Caine was reunited with William Tirebuck, a friend from his school days, when the business of their masters brought them together. United in their interest in literature, they made a juvenile attempt to establish a monthly manuscript magazine, assisted by Tirebuck&#x27;s sister. Tirebuck was editor, printer, publisher and postman; Caine was principal author. One of the magazine&#x27;s contributors inherited a small fortune which he invested. About ten thousand copies were printed, followed by a delayed issue no.2. After this venture Tirebuck returned to his position as junior clerk in a merchant&#x27;s office.

Suffering from what he described as &quot;the first hint of one of the nervous attacks which even then beset me&quot;, and later as &quot;the first serious manifestation of the nervous attacks which have pursued me through my life&quot;, Caine quit his job with Murray and, arriving unannounced, went to live with his uncle and aunt, James and Catherine Teare in Maughold on the Isle of Man.

Teare was the local schoolmaster, and as Caine was to learn, ill with tuberculosis. Caine became his assistant teaching in the schoolhouse. Finding their accommodation in part of the schoolhouse was crowded Caine camped in a nearby &quot;tholtan&quot;, a half-ruined cottage. Using his stonemason skills, taught to him by his grandfather Hall, he restored and lived in the cottage. On the stone lintel above the door he carved the name Phoenix Cottage and the date 8 January 1871.

Encouraged by Teare, after he had written to reassure Caine&#x27;s parents that he might one day be able to make a living as a writer, Caine wrote anonymous articles for a local newspaper on a wide range of religious and economic questions.

John Ruskin had started his Guild of St George and began expressing his ideas in his new monthly series, &quot;Fors Clavigera&quot;, written as a result of his feelings regarding the acute poverty and misery in Great Britain at the time. Rumours of undergraduates, following Ruskin&#x27;s ideas, digging the ground outside Oxford, reached Caine. He was inspired by Ruskin to begin writing denunciations of the social system and of the accepted interpretation of the Christian faith. Caine was to become &#x27;an eager pupil and admirer&#x27; of Ruskin. He later became a frequent visitor to Ruskin&#x27;s Coniston home, Brantwood.

Following the death of James Teare in December 1871, Caine carved a headstone for the grave. After officially taking his place as schoolmaster, he also performed the extra unpaid services his uncle had provided, &quot;such as the making of wills for farmers round about, the drafting of agreement and leases, the writing of messages to banks protesting against crushing interest, and occasionally the inditing of love letters for young farm hands to their girls in service on farms that were far away&quot;. Later he drew on this material to use in his writing.
In March 1872, he had a letter from Murray his master, the architect, which said &quot;Why are you wasting your life over there? Come back to your proper work at once.&quot; Caine was on his way back to Liverpool within a week.

===Journalist and theatre critic===
In April 1872, at the age of eighteen, Caine was back home in Liverpool where he set about applying his knowledge, gained working in the drawing office, into articles on architectural subjects, and subsequently published in &quot;The Builder&quot; and &quot;The Building News&quot;. These were Caine&#x27;s first works published for a national audience. The articles caught Ruskin&#x27;s attention and he wrote words of encouragement to Caine.

Seeking to be published, he offered his services, without payment, as a theatre critic to a number of Liverpool newspapers, which were accepted. He used the pseudonym &#x27;Julian&#x27;. Before Henry Irving played Hamlet, his intention to play the part differently to any other actor was known to Caine and he contributed many articles on the subject to various papers. The study of Shakespeare and the Bible from his earliest years were his &#x27;chief mental food&#x27;. As he had become more absorbed by literary studies he was not content with reading Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, so he was reading all of the most notable playwrights of the Elizabethan age and &quot;he began to make acquaintance with the dramatists&quot;. In the summer of 1872 Caine wrote his first play. &quot;The Charter&quot; was an adaptation of Charles Kingsley&#x27;s novel &quot;Alton Locke&quot;, but as an unknown writer he could not get it staged. &quot;Partly from the failure of faith in myself as a draughtsman and partly from a desire to be moving on&quot; Caine left his employment with Murray and joined the office of Richard Owen and later Wainwright and Son. For a few years he was general assistant to a builder, James Bromley who became his friend.

Together with William Tirebuck and George Rose, his friends from school days, Caine applied himself to establishing Liverpool branches of the Shakespeare Society, and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. They called their own organisation Notes and Queries Society and held their meetings at the prominent Royal Institution, Colquitt Street. Caine was president of the society and their meetings were reported in the Liverpool newspapers. The &#x27;Notes&#x27; were often provided by John Ruskin, William Morris and Dante Gabriel Rossetti.

On 16 October 1874 Henry Irving wrote to Caine agreeing to his request to use his portrait in &quot;Stray Leaves&quot; a new monthly magazine he was launching. In his capacity as critic of the Liverpool &quot;Town Crier&quot;, Caine attended the first night of &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Lyceum Theatre, London, on 31 October 1874, with Irving in the title role. Caine was enthralled by Irving&#x27;s performance and after his enthusiastic review was published in the newspaper, he was asked to reprint it as a broad-sheet pamphlet, as it was of such a high quality.

Caine&#x27;s first short story &quot;Max Wieland&quot; was published in the &quot;Liverpool Critic&quot; around 1874. A year later Caine became dramatic critic of the &quot;Spectator&quot;. Caine&#x27;s long narrative poem, &quot;Geraldine&quot;, appeared in print in March 1876. It was a completion of Coleridge&#x27;s unfinished poem &quot;Christabel&quot;.

The Caine family had moved into a larger house in 1873, at 59 South Chester Street, Toxteth, where Caine shared a bedroom with his younger brother John, a shipping clerk. John contracted tuberculosis which he passed to his brother. By 1875 Caine had permanent lodgings in New Brighton, spending weekends there &quot;for the sake of his health&quot;. Caine became increasingly unwell from the beginning of January 1877. In April the same year John, died from tuberculosis, aged 21. Dangerously ill, Caine was terrified of suffering the same fate. He recovered, but the disease left him with permanent lung damage, and throughout his life he had attacks of bronchitis. In his 1913 novel &quot;The Woman Thou Gavest Me&quot;, he describes Mary O’Neil dying of tuberculosis.
Manchester Corporation had covertly been buying land for building the proposed Thirlmere Aqueduct, intended to supply water to the city. When discovered, it outraged the local community. Thirlmere, close to the centre of the Lake District, in an area, not only celebrated in the poetry of early conservationist William Wordsworth and fellow Lake poets, but also used as a summer residence by writers, amongst others. In opposition to damming the lake at Thirlmere to form a reservoir, the first environmental group, Thirlmere Defence Association was formed in 1877. It was supported by the national press, Wordsworth&#x27;s son and John Ruskin. Caine, incensed at what he perceived as a threat to his beloved Cumbria, joined the movement, initiating a Parliamentary petition. Thirlmere was to be the setting for his novel &quot;The Shadow of a Crime&quot;.

In response to his lecture &quot;The Supernatural in Shakespeare&quot;, given in July 1878, in a meeting chaired by Professor Edward Dowden, Matthew Arnold wrote him a long letter of praise. He was also praised by Keats&#x27;s biographer, Lord Houghton. The lecture appeared in &quot;Colburn&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot; in August 1879,

Irving presided at a meeting of the Liverpool Notes and Queries Society in September 1878. At Irving&#x27;s invitation, he travelled to London to attend Irving&#x27;s first night at the Lyceum Theatre under his own management, presenting his new production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; with Ellen Terry as Ophelia on 30 December. It was at this time that Caine was introduced to Irving&#x27;s business manager, Bram Stoker, who was to become one of his closest friends. Stoker was subsequently to dedicate his famous novel &quot;Dracula&quot; to Caine, under the nickname &#x27;Hommy-Beg&#x27;.

In 1879 Caine edited a booklet of the papers presented to the Notes and Queries Society by William Morris, Samuel Huggins and John J. Stevenson on the progress of public and professional thought on the treatment of ancient buildings which was described as &quot;&#x27;well worth reading&quot;. At the 1879 Social Science Congress held in Manchester Town Hall, Caine read his paper &quot;A New Phase of the Question of Architectural Restoration&quot;. He spoke of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, its purpose, actions and achievements. Caine had joined the society the previous year and remained a member for the rest of his life. One of the society&#x27;s founders was William Morris.

===Friendship with Francis Tumblety===
As a young man of 21 Caine encountered the self-proclaimed &#x27;Great American Doctor&#x27;, Francis Tumblety, aged 43, after he set up at 177 Duke Street, Liverpool, offering herbal cure-all elixirs and Patent medicines to the public, which he claimed were secrets of the American Indians. Tumblety posed at various times in his life as a surgeon, an officer in the federal army, and a gentleman. He always followed his name with &quot;M.D.&quot; and used the title &#x27;Doctor&#x27;, without the supporting qualifications, for which he was fined in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1860.

From September 1874, Tumblety was announcing his arrival in Liverpool by advertising in local newspapers, later including testimonials. Following the death of Edward Hanratty in January 1875, the same night he took a spoon of medicine supplied by Tumblety, and action taken by William Carroll to sue Tumblety for £200 after allegedly publishing a false testimonial, Tumblety fled to London. Many newspapers reported the stories and in the wake of this adverse publicity, Tumblety recruited Caine to edit his biography. Late January Tumblety wrote requesting Caine to obtain a quote for printing ten thousand copies in Liverpool, telling of being betrayed by a supposed friend, and praising Caine for his genuine friendship. After Caine forwarded his letters, he wrote on 1 February discussing the upcoming biography and enclosed a letter supposedly originating from the Isle of Wight, by Napoleon III. The following day the first advert for the upcoming pamphlet appeared in the &quot;Liverpool Mercury&quot;. Tumblety changed lodgings, initially missing an urgent telegram from Caine indicating there was a problem with the publication. His response was to tell Caine to stop until he saw the proofs. Tumblety offered to pay for Caine to visit him in London to discuss the pamphlet, his letter dated 16 February indicating Caine had taken up the offer. He told a friend that his visit to Tumblety was &quot;arduous&quot;. A spate of correspondence relating to the publication ensued, Tumblety supplying Caine with names of notable people to be included in the pamphlet, along with money for printing and advertising. Tumblety later wrote of disputes with the printer. Claiming to be too ill to send money, he sent Caine a printer&#x27;s bill for payment. Tumblety had hired an assistant who read the proofs to him. The pamphlet entitled &quot;Passages from the Life of Dr Francis Tumblety&quot;, and the fourth of Tumblety&#x27;s biographies, was published in March 1875.

Tumblety wrote to Caine in April 1875 that he was contemplating manufacturing his pills in London, and required a partner to share the profits, telling Caine to approach Liverpool chemists as proposed outlets. Caine had declined a further invitation to London, but Tumblety persisted with his invites to join him in London, later made by telegram, additionally inviting him on a planned trip to America. Around the time Alfred Thomas Heap was hanged in Kirkdale Gaol, Liverpool, for an abortion-related death, Tumblety, who had been arrested in 1857 for selling abortion drugs, disappeared. Caine made enquiries as to his whereabouts. Briefly Tumblety set up offices in Union Passage, Birmingham. His correspondence turned menacing, demanding money from Caine. Tumblety left London for New York City in August 1876. Failing to entice Caine to join him, he followed months later with a pleading letter from San Francisco, after which there is no record of any further contact.

===Rossetti years===
Caine delivered a series of three lectures on Dante Gabriel Rossetti&#x27;s work and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood movement at Liverpool Library between November 1878 and March 1879. The January lecture entitled &quot;The Poetry of Dante Rossetti&quot; was printed in Colburn&#x27;s &quot;New Monthly Magazine&quot; in July 1879. Caine sent a copy of the magazine to the poet Rossetti, who by that time had become a virtual recluse and was &quot;ravaged by years of addiction to chloral and too much whisky&quot;.
Rossetti wrote his first letter to Caine on 29 July 1879. This letter was the first of nearly two hundred in quick succession. 
Around this time Caine&#x27;s father was badly injured in an accident at work and Caine took responsibility for supporting his parents and siblings. Early in 1880 he wrote &quot;Stones Crying Out&quot;, a short book on the restoration of old buildings. Two of the chapters were papers he had read at the Social Science Congress and Liverpool Library. Rossetti introduced Caine to Ford Madox Brown, who was at the time working on &quot;The Manchester Murals&quot;. Following his visit to write an article on Brown&#x27;s frescoes in July 1880 they became friends. On a later visit Caine accepted Brown&#x27;s invitation to sit for one of the figures while he was working on &quot;The Expulsion of the Danes from Manchester&quot;, the third fresco. On another visit he modelled for &quot;Crabtree watching the Transit of Venus A.D. 1639&quot;, the fifth fresco to be painted. Caine and Rossetti eventually met in September 1880 when Caine visited Rossetti in his home at 16 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London, where he lived &quot;in shabby splendour&quot;.

The strain of overworking was affecting Caine&#x27;s health and in 1881, deciding to focus on his literary career, he left his job at Bromley &amp; Son and went to St John&#x27;s in the Vale, Cumbria. Before long Rossetti wrote that he too was ill and asked Caine to go to London planning to return to Cumbria with him. By the time Caine arrived in London Rossetti had changed his mind and instead Caine became Rossetti&#x27;s housemate. Early in September, persuaded by friends and family Rossetti spent a month with Caine at St John&#x27;s in the Vale, accompanied by Fanny Cornforth. Whilst there, Caine recited a local myth to Rossetti. The myth was to become the inspiration for his first novel &quot;The Shadow of a Crime&quot;. He was also delivering weekly lectures in Liverpool.

Caine negotiated the acquisition of Rossetti&#x27;s largest painting &quot;Dante&#x27;s Dream of the Death of Beatrice&quot; by Liverpool&#x27;s Walker Art Gallery, representing the painter at its installation in November 1881. In January 1882 Caine&#x27;s anthology &quot;Sonnets of Three Centuries&quot; was published.

After Rossetti &quot;had an attack of paralysis on one side&quot;, his medical adviser, Mr John Marshall, recommended a change of air. Architect John Seddon offered Rossetti the use of Westcliffe Bungalow at Birchington, Kent. Caine eventually persuaded Rossetti to make the trip to Birchington, and they both arrived on 4 February 1882, accompanied by Caine&#x27;s sister and Rossetti&#x27;s nurse. Caine stayed with Rossetti until Rossetti&#x27;s death on Easter Sunday, 1882.

==Start of literary career==

From 1882 Caine was employed as a leader-writer on the &quot;Liverpool Mercury&quot; and was given free rein as to the subject and number of articles he wrote. This gave him the opportunity to attend and review numerous first nights at the London theatres. One review angered actor-playwright Wilson Barrett and he demanded a meeting with Caine. Barrett concluding his complaint added &quot;I think you could write a play, and if someday you should hit on a subject suitable to me, I shall be glad if you will let me hear of it&quot;.

Caine&#x27;s &quot;Cobwebs of Criticism: A Review of the First Reviewers of the Lake, Satanic and Cockney Schools&quot; was published in 1883. It began as a series of Liverpool lectures exposing unjustified reviews of poets Byron, Coleridge, Hunt, Keats, Shelley, Southey and Wordsworth that were written during their lifetimes

Returning to London after Rossetti&#x27;s death, Caine moved into 18 Clement&#x27;s Inn in July 1882, sharing rooms with his academic friend Eric Robertson, where they often hosted intellectual gatherings. They frequently had their evening meals delivered from a nearby coffee shop in Clare Market, which were brought by two young women; one was the 19-year-old Mary Chandler who was to eventually marry Caine.
Mary was the fourth of seven children. She was born 23 April 1863, the daughter of Mary and William Chandler, a General Dealer, and grew up in Bethnal Green. William died in 1873 and her mother married John Ward, a Poulterer, in Shoreditch. The family moved to the City of London where John became a Hawker.
Months after Mary had first met Caine, John Ward and the other girl&#x27;s father confronted Caine and Robertson demanding marriage, claiming the young women had been &#x27;ruined&#x27;. According to Caine&#x27;s biographer, nothing more than &#x27;a bit of flirting&#x27; had taken place. Refusing to marry, Caine went to Liverpool to deliver lectures, returning to London in early December 1882. Upon Caine&#x27;s return Mary&#x27;s stepfather abandoned her at Clement&#x27;s Inn. Mary went to Sevenoaks for six months to be educated, financed by Caine; she had received little education as a child.

At the end of October 1883, with enough money to last about four months Caine, accompanied by Mary, went to the Isle of Wight where he rented Vectis Cottage, close to the cliffs and sea near Sandown. There he set to work writing his first novel &quot;The Shadow of a Crime&quot;. Inspired by his Cumbrian heritage the plot was based on one of the oldest legends of the Lake District, told to him by his grandfather, Ralph Hall. In it he uses the Cumbrian dialect that he had listened to and spoke during his childhood. When he had finished he moved back to London. Living in rooms on the fourth floor of New Court, in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, he re-wrote it. After running as a serial in the &quot;Liverpool Weekly Mercury&quot;, Caine&#x27;s novel was published in February 1885, by Chatto &amp; Windus, and serialised in several newspapers. His reputation was immediately established, along with a foremost place among the novelists of the day. He was later invited to write the story of writing &quot;The Shadow of a Crime&quot;, which after its appearance in &quot;the Idler&quot; was published in 1894 in &quot;My First Book&quot;. After the publication of Caine&#x27;s first novel, Mary created a series of scrapbooks containing items relating to his public life.

Mary and Caine&#x27;s son, Ralph Hall, was born in their rented house Yarra, Worseley Road, Hampstead on 15 August 1884. The following month they moved to live in Aberleigh Lodge, Red House Lane, Bexleyheath, next door to William Morris&#x27; Red House, where they remained until 1889.

Caine had many friends in London&#x27;s elite artistic and intellectual circles. As a friend of Stoker and Irving for many years he became a regular at Irving&#x27;s Beefsteak Room gatherings at the Lyceum, presided over by Ellen Terry, where he became acquainted with the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII). At one supper, where the only other guest was composer Alexander Mackenzie, Caine breaking the rules, brought his son Ralph with him.

In order to make essential money and acquire exposure in America, disregarding the advice of his friends, Caine&#x27;s short novel &quot;She&#x27;s All The World To Me&quot;, was published in New York, in 1885 by Harper &amp; Brothers. &quot;She&#x27;s All The World To Me&quot; was the first of his novels to be set on the Isle of Man. Under American copyright laws the book&#x27;s copyright was forfeited to Harper and Brothers, a situation unforeseen by Caine, he was incensed. Caine recycled much of the material from the book in his later works, particularly in &quot;The Deemster&quot;. &quot;She&#x27;s All The World To Me&quot; was serialised in the &quot;Liverpool Weekly Mercury&quot; between 21 March and 4 April 1885 immediately following &quot;The Shadow of a Crime&quot;.

Set in the contrasting locations of the Vale of Newlands in the Lake District and Victorian London, &quot;A Son of Hagar&quot;, Caine&#x27;s third novel was written in 1885–86 and published in 1886 by Chatto and Windus. Begun in collaboration with Robert Buchanan, their partnership was discontinued early on after discovering they did not work well together. Dealing with the theme of illegitimacy, Caine has written a story close to his own life. The opening scene is set in Victorian London police court where a girl is charged with attempted suicide after she and her illegitimate baby had been dragged from the Thames, a scene he could well have witnessed while working as reporter. Later Caine attempted to suppress &quot;A Son of Hagar&quot; from both of the Collected Editions of his novels. Licensed to Thomas Nelson in 1907 by Chatto, the novel was printed in the &quot;Nelson Library&quot;.

In 1886 Mary and Caine travelled to Scotland to watch Irving when he was on tour in Edinburgh where they covertly married on 3 September under Scottish law by declaration before witnesses. Mary became a devoted wife, reading all his work, advising and criticising when appropriate and was his first secretary.

Two of Caine&#x27;s sonnets, &quot;Where Lies the Land!&quot; and &quot;After Sunset&quot;, were included in William Sharp&#x27;s 1886 anthology &quot;Sonnets of this Century&quot;. Publisher Walter Scott engaged Eric Robertson, Caine&#x27;s former roommate, to edit a series entitled &quot;Great Writers&quot;. Aware of the study Caine had already made of Coleridge, Robertson asked Caine to contribute a brief biography of the poet to the series. In three weeks Caine wrote &quot;Life of Coleridge&quot;, published in 1887. November the same year &quot;The Deemster&quot; was published in three volumes by Chatto &amp; Windus. It was set in 18th century Isle of Man, where the title of Deemster is given to the Island&#x27;s judges. The plot includes the story of a fatal fight, with the body being taken out to sea only to float back to land the next day. It ran to more than fifty English editions and was translated into every major European language. Caine sent a copy of the novel to Wilson Barrett as he suited the main character, then set to work adapting his novel into a stage version called Ben-my-Chree, Manx for &#x27;Girl of my Heart&#x27;. Irving, after reading the book, saw potential in it, himself playing the Bishop. The play opened at the Princess Theatre on 17 May 1888 and ran for a profitable nine weeks. It was a popular staple on Barratt&#x27;s provincial and international tours for several years afterwards and was successfully produced by others to whom he licensed the rights. An appreciative Caine acknowledged Barratt&#x27;s substantial contribution by naming him co-writer.

==Middle years==
===First visit to Iceland===
The first title published by Heinemann was Caine&#x27;s 1890 three-volume novel &quot;The Bondman&quot;, a plot of revenge and romance set in the late 18th century Isle of Man and Iceland. It commences with the story of a seaman who marries the daughter of Iceland&#x27;s Governor-General, abandoning her before the birth of their child. Between June and November 1889 it was serialised in the &quot;Isle of Man Times&quot;, &quot;General Advertiser&quot; and several provincial newspapers. Accompanied by Mary, Caine made a research visit to Iceland in August 1889, during which he made a seventy-mile round day trip from Reykjavík to Krýsuvík. William Heinemann was so pleased with initial sales, eventually selling almost half a million copies, that he named his company&#x27;s telegraphic address after the novel&#x27;s main character, &quot;Sunlocks&quot;.

===Cumbria===
Caine leased Castlerigg Cottage in Keswick in 1888. The following year Caine bought Hawthorns out of part of his earnings from &quot;Ben-my-Chree&quot;. Hawthorns was a small square-built stone house on the Penrith Road, a mile outside Keswick, overlooking Bassenthwaite Lake and Derwentwater. Caine also rented a pied-à-terre at Albert Mansions, Victoria Street, London. Hawthorns was close to Chesnut Cottage that Shelley had rented in 1811 and Greta Hall home of the poets Coleridge and Southey. The house had ten acres of land where Caine kept two ponies he had transported from Iceland. Mary learned to make butter and cheese. The Caines lived at Hawthorns for four years.

In 1890 Bram Stoker began his notes for his &quot;Dracula&quot; novel. Caine published a magazine serial in 1895 called &quot;Unto the Third and Fourth Generation&quot;. Stoker and Caine were lifetime literary friends. They shared an interest in mesmerism. Prior to being published in book form the story was renamed &quot;Drink: A Love Story on a Great Question&quot;. &quot;Drink&quot; contains a number of similarities to Stoker&#x27;s novel. In 1906 &quot;Drink&quot; was published by George Newnes, and illustrated by expatriate Italian American illustrator and painter Cyrus Cuneo. It was described in the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; as &#x27;a rather gruesome love story&#x27;. The story is of a girl who inherits a taste for alcohol from her father and is put on the road to recovery by hypnotic influence. Two hundred thousand copies of the book had been sold in England by the time the American edition was published by Appleton in 1907.

===Banning of &quot;Mahomet&quot;===
Caine&#x27;s &quot;Mahomet&quot; is a four-act historical drama based on the life of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, written in 1890 for the actor-manager Henry Irving. In Autumn 1889 Irving presented a copy of Henri de Bornier&#x27;s new play &quot;Mahomet&quot; to Caine, translated into English by Bram Stoker&#x27;s wife, Florence. Irving had been granted the English rights by Jules Claretie, director of France&#x27;s Théâtre Français and he asked Caine to revise it for staging at the Lyceum. The French government stopped Bornier&#x27;s play on 22 March 1890, partly due to the intervention of the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Caine called the play&#x27;s plot &quot;false to history, untrue to character, Western in thought and Parisian in sentiment&quot;. He continued with his own version that concentrated on Muhammad&#x27;s flight from Mecca and his triumphant return from Medina years later. Scenes were handwritten by Caine and subsequently reviewed by Irving after Stoker had them typed. Reviewed pages were returned with Irving&#x27;s edits and often Stoker&#x27;s suggestions. On 20 June a piece appeared in the French &quot;Journal des débats&quot; soon followed by a longer piece in &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; connecting Bornier&#x27;s &quot;Mahomet&quot; with Irving&#x27;s English production. William Henry (Abdullah) Quilliam orchestrated protests. In common with Caine he was of Manx descent, raised in Liverpool and had visited Morocco. Converting to Islam, Quilliam set up Britain&#x27;s first mosque and was made Sheikh al-Islam for the British Isles by Abdul Hamid II. Rumour that the play would be produced in London caused unrest in Britain&#x27;s Muslim communities, threatened British rule in parts of India and strained the nation&#x27;s relations with the Ottoman Empire. It was banned by the Lord Chamberlain, Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Earl of Lathom in his capacity as licencer of stage plays. Lathom&#x27;s intervention was unusual, illustrating the high level of concern by the British government. Caine&#x27;s completed play was accepted by Edward Smith Willard for production in America. Influenced by Renan&#x27;s &quot;Life of Christ&quot; he spent the remainder of 1890 hastily writing his own version. Dissatisfied with the result he refused to publish the book, despite being offered three thousand pounds for it in 1894.

===Morocco===
Caine travelled to Tangier, Morocco, for three weeks in March 1890, researching Muslim and Jewish life. Disregarding the advice of British consular officials Caine explored the Kasbah alone on foot at all hours of the day and night. Returning to Tangier in Spring 1891 to pick up local colour for his next novel &quot;The Scapegoat&quot;, he suffered an attack of malarial fever. Caine became the house-guest of Ion Perdicaris, who arranged Caine&#x27;s nursing until he was sufficiently recovered to return to England. In July of the same year &quot;The Little Manx Nation&quot; was published. It was originally delivered in the form of three lectures on the history of the Isle of Man which were given at the Royal Institution, London on 22 and 29 January and 4 February 1891. The book is dedicated to Manx poet Thomas Edward Brown, who supplied Caine with information on Manx legends and ballads.

&quot;The Scapegoat &quot; was written at Hawthorns immediately after Caine returned home from Morocco, while he was still impeded by malaria. First serialised in &quot;The Illustrated London News &quot; between July and October 1891, and then in &quot;The Penny Illustrated Paper&quot; between October 1891 January 1892. In the story, little Naomi is deaf and dumb and blind. Her mother is dead. She lives with her father, in Israel&#x27;s house. As Israel changes his ways to become a better person Naomi starts to regain her lost senses. The novel was published in two volumes in September 1891 by William Heinemann, and simultaneously in Europe, America and Canada. Set in Morocco in the last years of the Sultan Abd er-Rahman, it exposed anti-Semitic persecution and was described as a &#x27;scathing indictment of Moroccan tyranny&#x27;. The book was praised by &#x27;the most intelligent and influential members of the respectable Jewish community in London&#x27;. Caine&#x27;s Connections with the British Jewish community extended back to Caine&#x27;s youth. Novelist Israel Zangwill, enlisted Caine in the Zionist movement. &quot;The Scapegoat&quot; brought Caine a considerable correspondence, mainly because of its pro-Jewish stance. At this time Caine and Mary&#x27;s second son, Derwent was born on 12 September 1891.

===Mission to Russia===
Following the publication of &quot;The Scapegoat&quot;, Caine was approached by Hermann Adler, the Chief Rabbi and chairman of the Russo-Jewish Committee. Jews were fleeing Russia due to the pogroms and resulting atrocities happening there. Adler, certain no Jew would be allowed entry, requested Caine go to Russia and Poland on behalf of the committee. Caine&#x27;s plans to depart for Russia after Christmas 1891 were delayed until 15 June 1892 due to famine and riots there. Caine funded the trip himself, refusing subsidies offered by the committee. He carried Adler&#x27;s letter, in Hebrew, to present to the rabbis in the various towns on his journey, which &quot;secured him everywhere a most hospitable reception&quot; and for protection against the Russian authorities Caine carried a letter from Lord Salisbury, then Prime Minister. Caine managed to visit several Jewish communities in the Pale of Settlement but got no further than the frontier towns as many were dying due to a cholera outbreak. Fearing he was to suffer the same fate he returned to London, in time to attend Lord Alfred Tennyson&#x27;s funeral in October 1892. Caine remained in London after the funeral working on three novellas &quot;Cap&#x27;n Davey&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot;, &quot;The Last Confession&quot; and &quot;The Blind Mother&quot;, published in 1893 as one volume entitled &quot;Cap&#x27;n Davey&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot;. The book was edited by and dedicated to Stoker. At his suggestion, the last part of the title story was rewritten and &quot;The Last Confession&quot; was added. Set in Morocco, &quot;The Last Confession&quot; is based on Rossetti&#x27;s blank-verse poem of the same name. 
===Isle of Man===
For the purpose of writing &quot;The Manxman&quot; Caine rented Greeba Castle for six months, a castellated house in the Isle of Man overlooking the Douglas to Peel road. It was this book, published as one volume in August 1894 by Heinemann, that ended the system of three-volume novels. It is the story of Pete, a fisherman, considered by Kate&#x27;s father as too poor to marry her. Pete leaves to make his fortune, and is reported dead. Kate falls in love with Philip, Pete&#x27;s cousin and friend. Pete returns, creating a dilemma. The character of Pete was based on the Peel fishermen Caine mixed with and Joseph Mylchreest, a Manxman who made his fortune diamond mining in South Africa. Caine took full advantage of the subsequent Press attention. He was photographed and interviewed for the monthly magazines. The British sales of &quot;The Manxman&quot; totalled nearly 400,000. It was translated into twelve languages, selling over half a million copies by 1913. While in London in June and July 1894, Caine wrote a dramatic version of &quot;The Manxman&quot;, with Philip as the main character. Caine offered it to Herbert Beerbohm Tree, who refused it as being unlikely to appeal to the Haymarket Theatre audiences. On 22 August 1894, three weeks after the book was published, Wilson Barrett&#x27;s adaptation opened at the Grand Theatre, Leeds. Caine bought the Greeba Castle estate in 1896 with part of his earnings from &quot;The Manxman&quot;. His rented London home, 48 Ashley Gardens, in one of five red-brick Victorian mansion blocks adjacent to Westminster Cathedral, was changed to 2 Whitehall Court between Whitehall and the Victoria Embankment.

Caine wrote a guidebook entitled &quot;The Little Man Island: Scenes and Specimen Days in the Isle of Man&quot; for the 1894 tourist season. Published by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company it comprises a mixture of descriptions, pictures and advertising. At the end of the 19th century the Isle of Man was a popular tourist destination, a result of the Wakes Weeks, when Lancashire mills and factories closed for holidays. To meet growing demand the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company purchased new steamers to bring many thousands of tourists to Douglas from Liverpool. The Isle of Man Advertising Committee was set up in 1894 under the Advertising Rate Act. A group of bankers, local businessmen and developers built new hotels, boarding houses and entertainment venues. They formed a Committee publicising the Isle of Man as a holiday resort, opening an office in London with Caine&#x27;s brother in charge. When Caine wrote the Deemster in six weeks at a boarding house on the Douglas esplanade he saw these developments. He believed that the Island&#x27;s economic prosperity lay in developing this trade. The success of Caine&#x27;s novels set in the Isle of Man boosted the tourist trade. Tynwald Day, the island&#x27;s national day, became better known both in England and America because of his novels. Caine and Greeba Castle became a visitor attraction. Cruising around Great Britain aboard the Royal yacht, King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra visited the Isle of Man, in August 1902. They were the first British monarchs to set foot on Manx soil. The King had read most of Caine&#x27;s works and through reading them he wanted to visit the island. The Queen enjoyed Caine&#x27;s Manx novels and was interested to see where his characters lived. The royal party enjoyed Caine&#x27;s hospitality. He was invited to join the royal couple on their yacht and to accompany them on their tour of the island the following day.

===Canadian copyright===
At a time copyrights in Canada were governed by British laws and legal framework the Canadian Government was attempting to enact their 1889 Copyright Bill. Canadian publishers sought to exclude competition from the United States. Collection of duty on imported foreign reprints of British copyright books was to be stopped after 27 March 1895. This situation, named the Canadian copyright question, caused concern to the British Government and they involved both the Copyright Association and the Society of Authors, asking them to comment. During the ongoing discussions Caine maintained high profile, his interventions changing the course of the debate. Publishers in American recognised the threat of their market being flooded with cheap Canadian reprints on which no copyright fees would be paid. Proposed by Caine, the Society of Authors passed a unanimous vote, on 25 February 1895, against the Canadian Copyright Act. Caine suggested &quot;all authors should bind together to oppose the passing of the Act&quot;. The Society sent a petition to the Marquess of Rippon, signed by over 1500 mainly authors and publishers, requesting Queen Victoria withhold assent of the Canadian Copyright Bill. If passed, there would be nothing preventing other colonies asking for the same, threatening authors with the loss of the whole Colonial market. The Society of Authors invited Caine to act as their representative in Canada and to negotiate with the Canadian Government on the 1889 Canadian Act. Similarly Frederick Richard Daldy represented the Copyright Association. Edmund Newcome, the Canadian Deputy Minister of Justice, eventually visited England in August 1895 to address the Canadian copyright problem, after his plans to visit had been postponed multiple times. Newcombe, instructed only to meet with the government, met with Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, in London to begin work on a new draft copyright bill. The Copyright Association and the Society of Authors were kept informed of proceedings.

===First visit to the United States and Canada===
Caine arrived in New York 25 September 1895, accompanied by his wife Mary and eldest son Ralph, where they were met by his New York publisher William Appleton, an active in the struggle for an international copyright. He carried with him a letter of introduction to the Government of Canada from Chamberlain. On the street he was mobbed by fans. The following month Caine reached Canada, where he met with leading members of the publishing trade. He had long discussions with the Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie Bowell and the Canadian Minister of Justice Charles Tupper in Ottawa. At the request of the Canadian Copyright Association Caine went to Toronto where he had talks with the Toronto publishers. Caine resolved the dispute between the Canadian publishers, the Canadian Copyright Association and English authors. The proposed solution, that Canadian publishers would have the right to republish copyright works that had not been published in Canada within sixty days of publication elsewhere, was incorporated into the draft copyright bill. On 25 November 1895 Caine presented the draft bill at the Ottawa copyright conference where all parties agreed to it. The Canadian authorities and publishers were satisfied with the proposal put forward from England as were the American authors and publishers. The bill never became law, the 1889 Act was abandoned and a more flexible solution was found by 1900.

==Peak years==
===Second visit to the United States===

Taking two years to write, Caine&#x27;s novel &quot;The Christian&quot; was published by Heinemann in 1897. It is the first novel in Britain to have sold over a million copies The book was inspired by Rossetti&#x27;s verses &quot;Mary Magdalene at the Door of Simon The Pharisee&quot;, written for his painting, depicting a man trying to pluck back a woman about to enter the gates of heaven. Caine followed it with a lecture tour of Scotland, a one-man dramatic performance of his novelette &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;. &quot;The Christian&quot; was serialised in Britain in the &quot;Windsor Magazine&quot; between December 1896 and November 1897 and in the United States in &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Magazine&quot; between November 1896 and January 1898. Mainly set in Victorian London, it is the story of Glory Quayle, a young woman living an independent life who becomes an actress, and John Storm, who enters the priesthood. It was the first time that Caine had taken up the Woman Question. The character of John Storm is drawn from a composite of the Hon. and Rev. James Adderley, an Anglican priest of Berkley Chapel, Mayfair, London, and Father Stanton, who became an Anglican bishop. Caine dramatised the book in 1896. His play was so popular with the public that the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published it in a thick-paper, illustrated edition. He directed the play, travelling to New York where he went on to deliver a series of lectures and readings there. Viola Allen produced the play for the first time on the stage at Albany, New York on 25 September 1898. It opened at the Knickerbocker Theatre on 10 October 1898, running for twenty-one weeks in New York. Almost one thousand clergymen attended a matinee on 15 November 1898. George C. Tyler, reportedly made one million dollars from the Broadway production of &quot;The Christian&quot;. On his return to London after being on tour, Wilson Barratt gave Caine half of an advance payment received from an Australian manager for Barratt&#x27;s stage adaptation of &quot;The Christian&quot;. Caine rejected both the money and the play. Barratt unsuccessfully sued Caine on the grounds that they had an agreement to collaborate on the dramatisation. &quot;The Christian&quot; was first produced in England at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in October 1899. It failed after two months. Caine authorised a touring production with his sister Lily playing Glory Quayle and managed by her husband George Day which in 1907 was still continuously performed by up to three companies. After Finnish politician and writer Aino Malmberg sought aid from Caine on her country&#x27;s behalf, he offered the Finnish rights to the Finnish National Theatre. Finland belonged to the Russian Empire and was actively seeking Independence. Malmberg translated Caine&#x27;s works into Finnish.

===Rome===
Caine and his wife, Mary, spent four winters in Rome, renting a house, 18 Trinità de&#x27; Monti, near the Spanish Steps. On their visit between January and April 1901 Caine finished &quot;The Eternal City&quot;, his greatest commercial success. It is Caine&#x27;s only novel to be first conceived as a play. The story begins in Rome in 1900 at the fictional Pope Pius X&#x27;s jubilee celebrations, at the height of the dispute between the Vatican and the Italian state on the temporal power of the Church. David Rossi, a socialist and republican is accused of conspiring to assassinate the Italian king. He opposes Baron Bonelli, a corrupt prime minister. Bonelli tries to prevent the culmination of the love story between his mistress Donna Roma Volonna and Rossi. &quot;The Eternal City&quot; was serialised in Britain in 1901 in The Lady&#x27;s Magazine and in the United States in Collier&#x27;s Weekly, between February and August 1901. Immediately afterwards it was published in book form by Heinemann, with an initial print run of 100,000, running to twenty-six editions, selling more than a million copies in English alone and translated into thirteen languages. The stage adaptation opened at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, London on 2 October 1902, produced by actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree, with incidental music by Italian composer Pietro Mascagni. A week after the play opened in London, Caine republished the novel, cutting all the political parts and following the story of the play making it into a &#x27;theatre edition&#x27;. The American production of &quot;The Eternal City&quot; premiered on 17 November, at the Victoria Theatre, New York City, with Viola Allen as Roma, Frederic De Belleville as Bonelli, and Edward J. Morgan as Rossi. Caine supervised rehearsals. Towards the end of 1903 six companies were performing &quot;The Eternal City&quot;, in England, USA, Australia and South Africa.

===&quot;Household Words&quot;===
In 1901 Caine bought &quot;Household Words&quot;, the literary magazine founded by Charles Dickens in 1850. He appointed his son Ralph as editor, and it was sold in 1904. &quot;The Eternal City&quot; appeared as two instalments in the Christmas 1901 and January 1902 editions. He made many contributions including articles about Pope Leo XIII, whom he had a private audience with, the story &quot;A Maid of Mona&quot; and a serialisation of &quot;The Manxman&quot;. His writings on Roman Catholicism caused serious offence to his fellow members of the National Club of London, founded as a Protestant club.

Between 1902 and 1904 the Caine&#x27;s rented a large early Victorian house in London on Wimbledon Common, The Hermitage. It had been the last home of Scottish novelist Margaret Oliphant.
===Second visit to Iceland===
To obtain local colour for his novel &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; Caine visited Iceland in 1903. On one of two exploration trips that started from Reykjavik Caine discovered a cave about 200 feet long in the valley of Thingvellir, afterwards named &quot;Hall&#x27;s Hellin&quot; (Hall&#x27;s cave). On 26 August Caine was at the close of the Iceland Althing where he was a guest of Magnús Stephensen, the island&#x27;s Governor. At the Parliamentary dinner which followed, Caine was introduced &quot;as a distinguished &quot;skald&quot; (bard), whose writings were widely known and greatly admired in Iceland&quot;. &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; was published in November 1904 by Heinemann and translated into thirteen languages. It is set in a sheep-rearing community in rural Iceland, with scenes in London and the French Riviera. In &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; Magnus learns on his wedding day that his bride, Thora, is in love with his brother Oscar, a composer. She marries Oscar after Magnus releases her from the engagement. When Thora dies, a distraught Oscar places the only copies of his compositions in her coffin. Later he has her grave opened and his music retrieved. Caine&#x27;s use of a similar event to Rossetti&#x27;s exhumation of Elizabeth Siddal, where Rossetti recovered his poems that he had buried with her, caused a lasting rift between Caine and the Rossetti family. &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; was simultaneously dramatised, the copyright performance held at the Grand Theatre, Douglas. American and British productions opened days apart in 1905, at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., on 28 August, the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York City on 4 September and at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London on 7 September, with George Alexander playing Oscar and Caine&#x27;s sister Lilian playing Thora. After a long run at Drury Lane it was revived in 1907.

In September 1906 Caine&#x27;s dramatised version of &quot;The Bondman&quot; was produced in London&#x27;s Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, with Mrs Patrick Campbell playing a leading role and Caine&#x27;s son, Derwent (aged sixteen), making a stage début. A copyright performance had taken place at the Theatre Royal, Bolton in November 1982. Caine revised the play for Arthur Collins, moving part of the story to Sicily and creating a happy ending. The highlight of the show was the sulphur mine explosion and volcano eruption. In April 1906 Collins and Caine had gone on a research trip where they spent a day with Leone Testa, the inspector-general of Sicily&#x27;s sulphur mines and while visiting Naples they witnessed Mount Vesuvius erupt. The show ran for eleven weeks followed by eight weeks at the Adelphi Theatre and a revival of The Prodigal Son. The production went on tour in the UK and America. 
Japanese actor and a founder of Japanese modern theatre Otojirō Kawakami staged the play in Japan in 1909, changing the setting to Japan and the Philippines and included the volcanic eruption. When Kawakami&#x27;s new western style theatre Teikoku-za opened in Osaka in March 1910 the first production was The Bondman.

1908 saw the publication of &quot;My Story&quot;, described by Bram Stoker as &quot;autobiographical rather than an autobiography and gives insight to the life and character of his many friends and their influence on his life and work, and of the gradual growth of his mind and of his importance in the world as the success of each book gave him further opportunities.&quot;

===Egyptian nationalism===
On 13 June 1906 British officers shot pigeons for sport in Denshawai, an Egyptian village whose inhabitants were pigeon farmers, resulting in a clash between the officers and several villagers. One villager, falsely accused of murder was killed on the spot. Four villagers were hanged and others punished by jail sentences, hard labour and lashings. The Denshawai Incident proved a turning point in the history of the British occupation of Egypt, starting a fierce political debate both in Egypt and Britain in which intellectuals and men of letters participated, eventually causing the resignation of Lord Cromer, the redoubtable British Consul General and de facto ruler of Egypt since 1882. Crucially poet Wilfred Scawen Blunt exposed the facts in his pamphlet &quot;Atrocities of Justice Under British Rule in Egypt&quot;, provoking a public outcry in Britain. George Bernard Shaw drafted a petition published in &quot;The New Age&quot; with the main purpose of gaining the release of the Egyptian prisoners. Shaw denounces the &quot;Denshawai horror&quot; in his &quot;Preface to Politicians&quot; that introduces his &quot;John Bull&#x27;s Other Island&quot;. Caine&#x27;s literary response to the debate is his controversial novel &quot;The White Prophet.&quot; Shaw reviews &quot;The White Prophet&quot; and opposes literary censorship in &quot;Bernard Shaw on Shams of Rule and of Religion&quot;. Set in Egypt at the start of the twentieth century, twenty years into the British occupation and opening with a ceremonial re-enactment of the Battle of Omdurman, &quot;The White Prophet&quot; is the story of Colonel Charles George Lord, a British officer who joins the crusade of Ishmael Ameer, a Muslim prophet against selfishness and sedition. Lord compares him with Christ and John the Baptist. Ameer plans a coup against the British in Sudan, after developing political ambitions. &quot;The White Prophet&quot; is Caine&#x27;s only book never to have been reprinted; its sympathies for Egyptian nationalism rendered it a commercial failure. Caine used material from &quot;Mahomet&quot; and &quot;The Mahdi&quot; in the novel. Accompanied by his wife, he made three research visits to Egypt, March to May 1907, then January to May in 1908 and similarly in 1909 when he was joined by actor manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Cromer failed to meet Caine during his visit to Egypt in 1907, instead Caine wrote urging him to grant the Egyptians wish &quot;for a speedy fulfilment of England&#x27;s promise to get out of Egypt as soon as it was safe to do so&quot; and to &quot;yield to legitimate claims to national independence&quot;. Originally entitled &quot;The White Christ&quot;, it was serialised in the British and US editions of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; between December 1908 and November 1909, and subsequently translated into seven languages. The Arabic translation was serialised in Cairo-based newspaper &quot;al-Minbar&quot;. Douglas Sladen read the first two instalments of &quot;The White Prophet&quot; and had the idea of writing a counterblast, the novel &quot;The Tragedy of the Pyramids: A Romance of Army Life in Egypt&quot;. Closing the preface he writes &quot;I felt bound to challenge the false light in which he presents the British Army of Occupation in Egypt to the public&quot;. A copyright performance was performed at the Garrick Theatre, London on 27 November 1908. Beerbohm Tree&#x27;s plans to produce a dramatised version at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, London, which he was to direct and star in, were abandoned following threats to lobby the Lord Chamberlain against granting a licence for the play, banning it. Cromer is reported to have protested to the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Department that &quot;the state of the Nationalist agitation in Egypt made a dramatic representation of some of its features injudicious&quot;. The character of John Lord is widely believed to be Cromer. Promoting the publication of &quot;The White Prophet&quot; by Heinemann on 12 August 1909, Caine published a series of eight articles &quot;Aspects of the East&quot; in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Heinemann published Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Critics of The White Prophet&quot; as a pamphlet, endorsing the novel&#x27;s political viewpoint. It was to have been the preface for the second edition.
On 15 August 1910, Caine&#x27;s new stage adaptation of &quot;The Deemster&quot; entitled &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Son&quot; opened at the Grand Theatre, Douglas, Isle of Man, with Caine&#x27;s son, Derwent, playing Dan. It went on to open at London&#x27;s Garrick Theatre on 28 September 1910 with Bransby Williams as Dan, which ran for seven performances.

===Controversy of &quot;The Woman Thou Gavest Me&quot;===
Caine&#x27;s novel &quot;The Woman Thou Gavest Me: Being the Story of Mary O&#x27;Neill&quot;, published by Heinemann in 1913, &quot;caused the biggest furore of any of his novels&quot;. Translated into nine languages, worldwide advance orders for the book exceeded 200,000. From October 1912 it was serialised in Britain in &quot;Nash&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and concurrently in the United States in &quot;Hearst&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. The following month serialisation began in &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. Circulating libraries divided new books into three categories: satisfactory, doubtful and objectionable.
They attempted to boycott &quot;The Woman Thou Gavest Me&quot; along with Compton Mackenzie&#x27;s &quot;Sinister Street&quot; and W. B. Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Garden&quot;, for failing their criteria. The authors directed a publicity campaign opposing the boycott. &quot;The Woman Thou Gavest Me&quot;, the second of Caine&#x27;s novels to address the Woman Question, &quot;arraigns the divorce laws&quot; of the time. Father Bernard Vaughan, known for his sermons on &quot;The Sins of Society&quot;, denounced Caine&#x27;s book saying &quot;it showed startling ignorance of Roman Catholic doctrine and practice&quot;. The novel was one of several books the Catholic Federation in Auckland, New Zealand wanted removed from sale. In Wyndham, Western Australia the committee of Little River Mechanics Institute Free Library ordered the book banned and burnt. American newspapers reported of a Methodist preacher&#x27;s daughter that eloped and married the son of a prominent family, who later divorced her and took away her child. She was arrested on the street for Immorality. After three days in jail Eugene V. Debs, five times Socialist candidate for President of the United States sheltered her in his home. It was Debs&#x27; &quot;challenge to the Christianity of Terre Haute&quot;, Indiana. Parallels were drawn between the problem that Debs handled in real life and Caine&#x27;s fictional story of Mary O&#x27;Neill, who marries unhappily and ends up on the street without shelter, with the whole world turned against her. &quot;The Woman Thou Gavest Me&quot; was reprinted five times before the end of 1913 when nearly half a million copies had been sold. The Times Literary Supplement listed it as the most popular novel of that year. New York&#x27;s Bookman, listed it as the fifth best-seller of October 1913.

English fiction was represented in Europe by Hall Caine, as French fiction was by Anatole France, Italian by Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, and German by Hermann Sudermann. &quot;Among English novelists who have made from fifty to sixty cents for every word in a long novel are Hall Caine and Marie Corelli. Compared with such money earners as these, Dickens, Thackeray, and George Eliot were poorly paid for their labor&quot;.

==Politics==
On 24 October 1901, Caine was elected a Member of the House of Keys in a by-election as a liberal-aligned independent for the constituency of Ramsey, Isle of Man, by a majority of 267 votes. Caine sought election to the Keys after the collapse of Dumbell&#x27;s Banking Company on Friday 2 February 1900. The crash resulted in a number of resignations and retirements, resulting in eleven by-elections. The Bank had held most of the island&#x27;s cash deposits and left businesses and residents without money. At the General election in 1903 Caine was re-elected for another five years.

During Caine&#x27;s election campaign he supported dominion status for the Island with a Manxman as Lieutenant-Governor, a directly elected Legislative Council and departmental officials appointed by and responsible to Tynwald. A pamphlet entitled &quot;Hall Caine&#x27;s Letters and Speeches on Manx Politics&quot; was published in 1903, containing his election speech and articles he wrote for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Black and White&quot;, describing his experiences and aspirations. In recognition of his single election speech Caine was appointed vice-president of the Land Nationalisation Society of Great Britain.

The Manx National Reform League made constitutional and social reform the central issues in the general election of 1903, after an extra-parliamentary initiative by journalist and printer Samuel Norris. It was influenced by Liberal demands for political change in the United Kingdom. In 1903 Caine was elected the first president of the Manx National Reform League. In 1904 the new House of Keys established a committee on constitutional reform, chaired by Caine, that prepared the 1907 petition for constitutional reform.

Caine retired from active politics in 1908. Due to the other pressures on his time he seldom spoke in the Keys. He also had little time to offer to politics on a larger scale. Prior to the Ramsey by-election, Caine was invited by Lloyd George to stand for the British parliament but he refused.

==The Great War==

Caine was aged 61 at the outbreak of the Great War. The British secretly set up the War Propaganda Bureau under MP Charles Masterman. Caine was one of twenty-five leading authors Masterman invited to the Bureau&#x27;s London headquarters, Wellington House on 2 September 1914 with the purpose of best promoting Britain&#x27;s interests during the war. Shortly after, Caine was one of fifty-three of the leading authors in Britain to sign the &#x27;Authors&#x27; Declaration&#x27;, a manifesto drafted by Masterman stating that Britain &quot;could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war.&quot; Issued on 17 September the document was sent by special cable to the &quot;New York Times&quot;. Caine abandoned literary contracts in America valued at 150,000 dollars in order to devote all his energies to the British war effort.

Following the Rape of Belgium Caine edited &quot;King Albert&#x27;s Book&quot; in support of the exiled King Albert of Belgium. It was Caine&#x27;s idea and was published at Christmas 1914 by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. The proceeds from the book, £20,000, went to the Daily Telegraph Belgium Fund, a fund created to support British efforts to receive and maintain Belgian refugees in Britain. In previous years Caine had edited several of these volumes already, the most recent for Queen Alexandra&#x27;s charities in 1905 and 1908. Caine invited authors, artists, composers, statesmen and many notable people to present their view of events in Belgium. &quot;King Albert‘s Book&quot; contains contributions from two hundred and fifty of the most famous people of the time. Among the contributors are British Prime Minister Asquith and then Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, painters Claude Monet and John Collier and composer Claude Debussy.

King Albert of Belgium made Caine an Officer of the Order of Leopold of Belgium for his humanitarian aid to the Belgian refugees in 1918. Caine&#x27;s portrait by the Belgian painter, Alfred Jonniaux, was presented to him by the Fine Art Department of the Belgian Government.

Caine wrote extensively in the English, American and Italian newspapers. He claimed that by this work and his personal influence with Italian statesmen he greatly helped bring Italy into the war on the side of the allies. President Woodrow Wilson had declared the United States neutral and his policy of neutrality was enormously popular with the American people. 
Caine urged America to join the war by writing articles, mainly for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and in 1915 he gave a series of lectures in the United States but these were not well received. In September 1915, at the conclusion of the first year of war, a series of articles featuring royalty, countries and events which included Archduke Ferdinand, the Kaiser and the Sinking of the RMS Lusitania that Caine had contributed to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; were published as a book entitled &quot;The Drama of 365 Days: Scenes in the Great War&quot;. Caine attended Nurse Edith Cavell&#x27;s memorial service in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, on 29 October 1915; the World War I British nurse who is celebrated for saving the lives of soldiers in Brussels from all sides without distinction. His account was published in The Daily Telegraph on 30 October and extensively in other newspapers. In 1916 he was invited to work with Lord Robert Cecil at the Foreign Office towards the creation of the League of Nations after the end of the war. &quot;Our Girls: Their Work for the War&quot;, is the title of Caine&#x27;s Christmas book published by Messrs Hutchinson early in December 1916, consisting of a series of Caine&#x27;s articles written for the Ministry of Munitions, together with additional stories of women&#x27;s working lives in the factories and in the hospitals. It was designed to be a gift for munitions girls to send to their men at the front.

The National War Aims Committee was set up in 1917 to focus on domestic propaganda. Caine was recruited for the committee by the Prime Minister David Lloyd George to write the screenplay for the propaganda film &quot;Victory and Peace&quot;, designed to show what would happen in a German invasion. Most of the negative of the newly finished film was destroyed in a fire at the offices of the London Film Company in June 1918. It was re-filmed over four-months, just as the war ended and was never released.

Towards the end of 1917 Caine was offered a baronetcy in recognition of the contribution he made to the war effort as an allied propagandist and his position as a leading man of letters. Caine declined the hereditary peerage and accepted a knighthood instead. He was made Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire(KBE), insisting on being called, not &#x27;Sir Thomas&#x27; but &#x27;Sir Hall&#x27;.

==After the war==

Begun in 1914 Caine&#x27;s &quot;The Master of Man: The Story of a Sin&quot; had been set aside for the duration of the Great War and resumed on the day after armistice in 1918. It is the story of Bessie Collister who has an illegitimate child. The baby&#x27;s father Victor Stowell, as judge, has to try Bessie for the murder of their child. Heinmann published the novel in July 1921. Of the initial one hundred thousand copies printed seventy thousand were advance orders. Due to his age and health Caine announced it was to be his last novel. Sales of &quot;The Eternal City&quot; in English had reached one million and fifty-two English editions of &quot;The Deemster&quot; had been published.
A Collected Edition of Caine&#x27;s novels followed, also published by Heinmann, issued not in order of publication but in the order of public demand.
The following year Caine acquired the &quot;Sunday Illustrated&quot; newspaper which had been founded by Horatio Bottomley.

Caine&#x27;s last novel &quot;The Woman of Knockaloe&quot; was brought out in 1923, this time published by Cassell&#x27;s. Caine&#x27;s strong anti-German feeling had turned to advocacy of reconciliation and pacifism. In the editorial note Newman Flower explains that the story was never intended to be published, but Flower happened to see the manuscript and persuaded Caine to publish it immediately. The book deals with the harm caused by racial hatred after Mona Craine, a British woman, falls in love with Oskar Heine, a German prisoner of war. The scene of the story is Knockaloe, a farm on the west coast of the Isle of Man, turned into an internment camp 1914–1918 for alien civilians. Caine was former part owner of the farm and suggested the establishment of the camp to the government. The camp was the first and largest of its kind in Europe, containing about twenty-five thousand aliens and two thousand British guard. The site was overlooked by Greeba Castle, Caine&#x27;s Manx house, four miles away. That year he sold the &quot;Sunday Illustrated&quot;. On Armistice Day 1923 Caine&#x27;s first radio broadcast, &quot;A Counsel of Peace&quot;, was made to the nation from the British Broadcasting Corporation in London.

Caine&#x27;s last published work in his lifetime was a revised version of &quot;Recollections of Rossetti&quot;, with a shortened title, to coincide with the 1928 centenary of Rossetti&#x27;s birth.

During the last eight years of his life Caine devoted himself to his life&#x27;s work a &quot;Life of Christ&quot;, which he had begun in 1893. On at least three occasions Caine visited Palestine and Transjordania, the last in 1929; consulting the best-known theologians of the time, and reading every book he could obtain on the subject. His health broke down under the strain and the book remained unfinished. In the statement he prepared for his obituary was written, &quot;one-fifth of the book is in a form fit for publication, the remainder not being in a condition which renders it possible that another author should complete it&quot;. The statement was disregarded by his sons and after extensive editing the book was published posthumously by his sons in 1938. The handwritten manuscript, including text and words, contained three million words, much of it indecipherable, to the extent that Caine&#x27;s former secretaries were called in to transcribe it. An editor, journalist Robert Leighton was employed to cut it down to half-a-million words. &quot;It was severely criticised by the reviewers and the sales were not large&quot;.

Along with Winston Churchill, Caine was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour in October 1922 for his services to literature and was granted the Freedom of Douglas in 1929 for promoting the Isle of Man through his writings.

==Films==
===1910s===
Most of Caine&#x27;s novels have been made into black-and-white silent films. The first film adaptation is &quot;The Christian&quot; (1911), by West&#x27;s Pictures in Australia. The twenty-eight-minute unauthorised film is the first directed by Franklyn Barrett. &quot;The Christian&quot; features the cast of the stage production by William Anderson&#x27;s Company. An unauthorised film of &quot;The Bondman&quot; (1916) was made by Fox Film Corporation in the United States and is the first film they released under their De Luxe brand. All of Fox&#x27;s 110 musicians accompanied &quot;The Bondman&quot; screenings. The music is composed by Max Steiner, Fox&#x27;s musical director. A financial and critical success it was re-released in 1918 as one of Fox&#x27;s Big Six. A further film version of &quot;The Bondman&quot; was released as &quot;The Red Samson&quot; (1917) in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The director was Michael Curtiz, who had by 1916 become one of Hungary&#x27;s most important directors.

The first authorised film of a Caine novel is &quot;The Christian&quot; (1914) released in the United States by the Vitagraph Liebler Company. The first eight reel film they made. Vitagraph leased the Harris Theatre on West 42nd Street, for the purpose of exclusively showing their own films, opening with &quot;The Christian&quot; starring Earle Williams and Edith Storey. Caine wrote the film scenario, the first time ever that a famous author undertook a film scenario of their own work. Vitagraph staff writer Eugene Mullins followed Caine&#x27;s own scenario.

Adapted and directed by established American screenwriter and director George Loane Tucker, &quot;The Christian&quot; (1915) was made by the London Film Company. The 9,000 feet film stars Caine&#x27;s son Derwent Hall Caine as John Storm. &quot;The Manxman&quot; (1916), also produced by the London Film Company and directed by Tucker, was filmed on the Isle of Man and, when released drew huge crowds in Britain and America. It was one of the few British films distributed in the United States that went on to become a financial and critical success. Starring Derwent Hall Caine and Marian Swayne &quot;The Deemster&quot; (1917), made in the United States, is the first special feature film Arrow Film Corporation made. Shot on location on Block Island, Rhode Island, the film was originally entitled &quot;The Bishop’s Son&quot; after Caine&#x27;s 1910 stage adaptation of &quot;The Deemster&quot; in which Derwent had also played Dan Mylrea and on which the film is based. Caine remained closely involved with the production; based in England, Caine reviewed the scenario and produced drawings of the character of the buildings to be used.

Adolph Zukor&#x27;s Famous Players Film Company produced the first version of &quot;The Eternal City&quot; (1915). The $100,000 epic film features stage star Pauline Frederick. Made on location in London and Italy in 1914 the production was interrupted by the start of the Great War and was completed in New York. For distribution of initially &quot;The Eternal City&quot; and other prestigious feature-length films Famous Players created the Select Booking Agency. Caine cabled the producers after attending the British premiere at Marble Arch Pavilion, in London congratulating them. The film was re-released in 1918 as part of the Paramount &quot;Success Series&quot;.

Prime Minister David Lloyd George recruited Caine in 1917 to write the screenplay for the propaganda film &quot;Victory and Peace&quot; (1918), made in Britain and directed by Herbert Brenon. Caine was appointed as chief adviser to the film campaign department of the National War Aims Committee. Lloyd George chose Caine due to his experience in the field of cinema and his &quot;reputation as a man of letters&quot;. On 20 September 1917, in Ithaca, New York, Brenon&#x27;s representative obtained the film rights of &quot;The Woman Thou Gavest Me&quot; from Derwent Hall Caine, Caine&#x27;s American agent, intending to start work in November 1917. The film was advertised but it was never made by Brenon. Adapted for the screen by Beulah Marie Dix, &quot;The Woman Thou Gavest Me&quot; (1919) was made by Famous Players–Lasky. Katherine MacDonald, stars in the film as Mary MacNeil. Immediately after completing &quot;The Woman Thou Gavest Me&quot; she set up her own production company.

===1920s===
Caine wrote the screenplay of &quot;Darby and Joan&quot; (1920). Made by Master Films the film was directed by Percy Nash featuring Derwent Hall Caine and Ivy Close. Many of the scenes were shot in the Isle of Man.

The fourth film adaptation of &quot;The Christian&quot; (1923) was by Goldwyn Pictures and directed by the celebrated Maurice Tourneur. Along with some of the cast, Tourneur travelled to the Isle of Man for location shooting where they were joined by Caine who co-operated in the filming of his work and held daily conferences with Tourneur. After the film was completed in the United States a print was sent to Caine in London where he wrote the intertitles.

Adapted and directed by A.E. Coleby &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; (1923) was made by Stoll Pictures, the largest British film company of the early 1920s, as the centrepiece of their 1923 releases. Costing £37,000 it was at the time the most expensive British production made. The film&#x27;s length at 18,454 feet made it the longest commercially made British film. The 4-hour 40-minute picture was released in two parts; part two titled &quot;The Return of the Prodigal&quot;.

Benito Mussolini featured in &quot;The Eternal City&quot; (1923) by the Samuel Goldwyn Company. Directed by George Fitzmaurice and shot on location in Rome less than a year after the March on Rome resulted in Mussolini&#x27;s National Fascist Party rising to power in Italy. The film portrays Mussolini as a leader saving his people from communism. Caine disapproved of the adaptation and attempted to withdraw his name from it.

The first American made film by noted Swedish actor-director Victor Sjöström for Goldwyn Pictures was adapted from The Master of Man. The title was changed to &quot;The Judge and the Woman&quot; before settling on &quot;Name the Man&quot; (1924). Samuel Goldwyn began negotiating the film rights before the novel was finished.

&quot;The Woman of Knockaloe&quot; was filmed by Paramount Pictures in 1927 as &quot;Barbed Wire&quot; and is the second American made film by German director Erich Pommer. It deals with a phase of WWI where German prisoners of war suffer the hatred of the French women and yet find romance. Then Alfred Hitchcock arrived on the Isle of Man to film &quot;The Manxman&quot; (1929) but he and Caine did not get on well and the rest of the film was shot in Cornwall. &quot;The Manxman&quot; was Hitchcock&#x27;s last silent film. Caine was not happy with it.

The British silent film &quot;The Bondman&quot; (1929) was directed by Herbert Wilcox.

===1930s===
After retiring from the army in 1922, Colonel Hanna joined the British Board of Film Censors and held the position of vice-president and chief censor throughout the 1930s. Gaumont British&#x27;s plan to film &quot;The White Prophet&quot; was abandoned after objections by Colonel Hanna as he thought it contained scenes with &quot;a tendency to bring the British army into contempt and ridicule&quot; and that &quot;no scene of cavalry charging the mob and causing 100 deaths….would be permissible on the screen&quot;.

Shortly before Caine&#x27;s death in 1931, Metro Goldwyn Mayer purchased the screen rights of &quot;The Christian&quot; with the intention of making a talking picture. The rights were reported as selling for £8000.

==Personal and domestic==
In appearance Caine was a short man who tended to dress in a striking fashion. His eyes were dark brown and slightly protuberant, giving him an intense stare. He had red-gold hair and a dark red beard which he trimmed to appear like the Stratford bust of Shakespeare; indeed if people did not notice the likeness he was inclined to point it out to them. He was also preoccupied throughout his life with the state of his health. This was often the result of overwork or other stresses in his life and he sometimes used nervous exhaustion as an excuse to escape from his problems.
In 1912, their son Derwent Hall Caine had an illegitimate daughter, Elin, and she was brought up as Caine and Mary&#x27;s child. By 1914 Mary at last had her own house in London: Heath Brow, which overlooked Hampstead Heath. After the Great War this house had become too big, and Mary moved into Heath End House, again overlooking Hampstead Heath. By 1922 they were informally separated; Caine could not live with Mary, nor could he break with her completely. From that time, they both suffered from various ailments.

On 31 August 1931, aged 78 Caine slipped into a coma and died at his home, Greeba Castle, Isle of Man. On his death certificate is the diagnosis of &quot;cardiac syncope&quot;. Following his death messages of condolence were received from the Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, King George V and Queen Mary.

At Caine&#x27;s funeral on Friday 4 September 1931 representatives of all branches of public life in the Isle of Man followed the coffin. Sixty thousand Manx people and holiday makers paid tribute on the 25-mile journey. At Douglas great crowds lined the route and the majority of businesses closed. An address was made by the Bishop of Man. Caine was buried in Kirk Maughold churchyard.

A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London on 9 September 1931. Rev. R.J. Campbell gave the address. The Prime Minister was represented by Charles Patrick Duff, and A.J. Sylvester represented Lloyd George.
In March 1932, six months after her husband&#x27;s death, Mary Hall Caine died from pneumonia. She was buried alongside her husband.

An Irish limestone obelisk depicting six characters from Caine&#x27;s novels and a likeness of Mary was erected over their grave. The design is based on the ancient Maughold Parish Cross that is preserved in the churchyard. The memorial is the work of artist Archibald Knox.

A statue of Hall Caine stands in Douglas, financed by money from the estate of Derwent Hall Caine.

==Postscript==

===Caine&#x27;s legacy===
Hall Caine was an enormously popular and best-selling author in his time. Crowds would gather outside his houses hoping to get a glimpse of him. He was &quot;accorded the adulation reserved now for pop stars and footballers&quot;, and yet today is virtually unknown.

Allen suggests two reasons for this: the first that, in comparison with Dickens, his characters are not clearly drawn, but are &quot;frequently fuzzy at the edges,&quot; while Dickens&#x27; characters are &quot;diamond-clear&quot;; and the second, that Caine&#x27;s characters also tend to be much the same. Something similar could also be said about his plots. However, the main shortcoming may be that, although Caine&#x27;s novels can be romantic and emotionally moving, they are bereft of humour and, on the contrary, replete with a deadly earnestness.

===Critical appraisals===
* Despite his proving the wealthiest of Victorian novelists, Caine has been largely dismissed as a mere melodramatist by subsequent criticism.
* G. K. Chesterton said in &quot;A Defence of Penny Dreadfuls&quot; that &quot;it is quite clear that this objection, the objection brought by magistrates, has nothing to do with literary merit. Bad story writing is not a crime. Mr. Hall Caine walks the streets openly, and cannot be put in prison for an anticlimax.&quot;
* Thomas Hardy criticised Caine for his excessive egotism.
* According to Luther Munday in &quot;A Chronicle of Friendships&quot;, Oscar Wilde said that Caine &quot;wrote at the top of his voice.&quot;

===Hall Caine Airport===
Hall Caine Airport was an airfield on the Isle of Man which was located near Ramsey. It was named after the author by his sons Gordon Hall Caine and Derwent Hall Caine, who were the project initiators and Hall Caine Airport flourished for a short period prior to the outbreak of the Second World War. From 1935 to 1937 it handled domestic scheduled passenger flights to English, Scottish and Irish airports. By 1937 it had fallen into disuse, primarily due to its location. Both Gordon Hall Caine and Derwent Hall Caine were particularly keen on the development of an aerodrome as they saw it as another bit of the island as being associated with their late father. They were said to be extremely interested in the progress of the Isle of Man and in particular its transport infrastructure. They also wished to include Ramsey&#x27;s municipal authority in the project, as they were both of the opinion that the aerodrome would bring immense benefit to the town.

The final commercial flight from Hall Caine Airport departed at 16:15hrs on Saturday 2 October 1937.

<text>A political cartoon, also known as an editorial cartoon, is a cartoon graphic with caricatures of public figures, expressing the artist&#x27;s opinion. An artist who writes and draws such images is known as an editorial cartoonist. They typically combine artistic skill, hyperbole and satire in order to either question authority or draw attention to corruption, political violence and other social ills.

Developed in England in the latter part of the 18th century, the political cartoon was pioneered by James Gillray, although his and others in the flourishing English industry were sold as individual prints in print shops. Founded in 1841, the British periodical &quot;Punch&quot; appropriated the term &quot;cartoon&quot; to refer to its political cartoons, which led to the term&#x27;s widespread use.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The pictorial satire has been credited as the precursor to the political cartoons in England: John J. Richetti, in &quot;The Cambridge history of English literature, 1660–1780&quot;, states that &quot;English graphic satire really begins with Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme&quot;&quot;. William Hogarth&#x27;s pictures combined social criticism with sequential artistic scenes. A frequent target of his satire was the corruption of early 18th century British politics. An early satirical work was an &quot;Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme&quot; (), about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720 known as the South Sea Bubble, in which many English people lost a great deal of money.

His art often had a strong moralizing element to it, such as in his masterpiece of 1732–33, &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, engraved in 1734. It consisted of eight pictures that depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from sex workers, and gambling—the character&#x27;s life ultimately ends in Bethlem Royal Hospital.

However, his work was only tangentially politicized and was primarily regarded on its artistic merits. George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s.

=== Development ===

The medium began to develop in England in the latter part of the 18th century—especially around the time of the French Revolution—under the direction of its great exponents, James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson, both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and caricature, and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon. Calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account, many of Gillray&#x27;s satires were directed against George III, depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of Revolutionary France and Napoleon. The times in which Gillray lived were peculiarly favourable to the growth of a great school of caricature. Party warfare was carried on with great vigour and not a little bitterness; and personalities were freely indulged in on both sides. Gillray&#x27;s incomparable wit and humour, knowledge of life, fertility of resource, keen sense of the ludicrous, and beauty of execution, at once gave him the first place among caricaturists.

George Cruikshank became the leading cartoonist in the period following Gillray (1820s–40s). His early career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications. He gained notoriety with his political prints that attacked the royal family and leading politicians and was bribed in 1820 &quot;not to caricature His Majesty&quot; (George IV) &quot;in any immoral situation&quot;. His work included a personification of England named John Bull who was developed from about 1790 in conjunction with other British satirical artists such as Gillray and Rowlandson.

=== Cartoonist&#x27;s magazines ===

The art of the editorial cartoon was further developed with the publication of the British periodical &quot;Punch&quot; in 1841, founded by Henry Mayhew and engraver Ebenezer Landells (an earlier magazine that published cartoons was &quot;Monthly Sheet of Caricatures&quot;, printed from 1830 and an important influence on &quot;Punch&quot;). It was bought by Bradbury and Evans in 1842, who capitalised on newly evolving mass printing technologies to turn the magazine into a preeminent national institution. The term &quot;cartoon&quot; to refer to comic drawings was coined by the magazine in 1843; the Houses of Parliament were to be decorated with murals, and &quot;carttons&quot; for the mural were displayed for the public; the term &quot;cartoon&quot; then meant a finished preliminary sketch on a large piece of cardboard, or in Italian. &quot;Punch&quot; humorously appropriated the term to refer to its political cartoons, and the popularity of the &quot;Punch&quot; cartoons led to the term&#x27;s widespread use.

Artists who published in &quot;Punch&quot; during the 1840s and 50s included John Leech, Richard Doyle, John Tenniel and Charles Keene. This group became known as &quot;The &quot;Punch&quot; Brotherhood&quot;, which also included Charles Dickens who joined Bradbury and Evans after leaving Chapman and Hall in 1843. &quot;Punch&quot; authors and artists also contributed to another Bradbury and Evans literary magazine called &quot;Once A Week&quot; (est.1859), created in response to Dickens&#x27; departure from &quot;Household Words&quot;.

The most prolific and influential cartoonist of the 1850s and 60s was John Tenniel, chief cartoon artist for &quot;Punch&quot;, who perfected the art of physical caricature and representation to a point that has changed little up to the present day. For over five decades he was a steadfast social witness to the sweeping national changes that occurred during this period alongside his fellow cartoonist John Leech. The magazine loyally captured the general public mood; in 1857, following the Indian Rebellion and the public outrage that followed, &quot;Punch&quot; published vengeful illustrations such as Tenniel&#x27;s &quot;Justice&quot; and &quot;The British Lion&#x27;s Vengeance on the Bengal Tiger&quot;.

=== Maturation ===

By the mid-19th century, major political newspapers in many countries featured cartoons designed to express the publisher&#x27;s opinion on the politics of the day. One of the most successful was Thomas Nast in New York City, who imported realistic German drawing techniques to major political issues in the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Nast was most famous for his 160 editorial cartoons attacking the criminal characteristics of Boss Tweed&#x27;s political machine in New York City. American art historian Albert Boime argues that:

As a political cartoonist, Thomas Nast wielded more influence than any other artist of the 19th century. He not only enthralled a vast audience with boldness and wit, but swayed it time and again to his personal position on the strength of his visual imagination. Both Lincoln and Grant acknowledged his effectiveness in their behalf, and as a crusading civil reformer he helped destroy the corrupt Tweed Ring that swindled New York City of millions of dollars. Indeed, his impact on American public life was formidable enough to profoundly affect the outcome of every presidential election during the period 1864 to 1884.

Notable editorial cartoons include Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Join, or Die&quot; (1754), on the need for unity in the American colonies; &quot;The Thinkers Club&quot; (1819), a response to the surveillance and censorship of universities in Germany under the Carlsbad Decrees; and E. H. Shepard&#x27;s &quot;The Goose-Step&quot; (1936), on the rearmament of Germany under Adolf Hitler. &quot;The Goose-Step&quot; is one of a number of notable cartoons first published in the British &quot;Punch&quot; magazine.

== Recognition ==
Institutions which archive and document editorial cartoons include the Center for the Study of Political Graphics in the United States, and the British Cartoon Archive in the United Kingdom.

Editorial cartoons and editorial cartoonists are recognised by a number of awards, for example the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning (for US cartoonists, since 1922) and the British Press Awards&#x27; &quot;Cartoonist of the Year&quot;.

== Modern political cartoons ==
Political cartoons can usually be found on the editorial page of many newspapers, although a few (such as Garry Trudeau&#x27;s &quot;Doonesbury&quot;) are sometimes placed on the regular comic strip page. Most cartoonists use visual metaphors and caricatures to address complicated political situations, and thus sum up a current event with a humorous or emotional picture.

Yaakov Kirschen, creator of the Israeli comic strip &quot;Dry Bones&quot;, says his cartoons are designed to make people laugh, which makes them drop their guard and see things the way he does. In an interview, he defined his objective as a cartoonist as an attempt to &quot;seduce rather than to offend.&quot;

Modern political cartooning can be built around traditional visual metaphors and symbols such as Uncle Sam, the Democratic donkey and the Republican elephant. One alternative approach is to emphasize the text or the story line, as seen in &quot;Doonesbury&quot; which tells a linear story in comic strip format.

Cartoons have a great potential to political communication capable of enhancing political comprehension and reconceptualization of events, through specific frames of understanding. Mateus&#x27; analysis &quot;seems to indicate that the double standard thesis can be actually applied to trans-national contexts. This means that the framing of politics and business may not be limited to one country but may reflect a political world-view occurring in contemporary societies. From the double standard standpoint, there are no fundamental differences in the way Canadian political cartoonists and Portuguese political cartoons assess politics and business life&quot;. The article does not state that all political cartoons are based on this kind of double standard, but suggests that the double standard thesis in political cartoons may be a frequent frame among possible others.

A political cartoon commonly draws on two unrelated events and brings them together incongruously for humorous effect. The humour can reduce people&#x27;s political anger and so serves a useful purpose. Such a cartoon also reflects real life and politics, where a deal is often done on unrelated proposals beyond public scrutiny.

== Pocket cartoons ==
A pocket cartoon is a form of cartoon which generally consists of a topical political gag/joke and appears as a single-panel single-column drawing. It was introduced by Osbert Lancaster in 1939 at the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. A 2005 obituary by &quot;The Guardian&quot; of its pocket cartoonist David Austin said &quot;Newspaper readers instinctively look to the pocket cartoon to reassure them that the disasters and afflictions besetting them each morning are not final. By taking a sideways look at the news and bringing out the absurd in it, the pocket cartoonist provides, if not exactly a silver lining, then at least a ray of hope.&quot;

== Controversies related to cartoons ==
Editorial cartoons sometimes cause controversies. Examples include the &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons controversy and Charlie Hebdo shooting (stemming from the publication of cartoons related to Islam) and the 2007 Bangladesh cartoon controversy.

Libel lawsuits have been rare. In Britain, the first successful lawsuit against a cartoonist in over a century came in 1921 when J.H. Thomas, the leader of the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the British Communist Party. Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of &quot;Black Friday&quot;—when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out Miners&#x27; Federation. Thomas won his lawsuit, and restored his reputation.

<doc id="205537" wikidata="Q4008531" url="?curid=205537" title="William Stanley (born 1548)">
<text>Sir William Stanley (1548 – 3 March 1630), son of Sir Rowland Stanley of Hooton (died 1612) and Margaret Aldersy, was a member of the Stanley family, Earls of Derby. He was an officer and a recusant, who served under Elizabeth I of England and is most noted for his surrender of Deventer to the Spanish in 1587.

==Early career==
Stanley was educated with Dr. Standish at Lathom and was brought up in the Catholic faith. After school, he entered the service of his kinsman, Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby (c.1508–1572), and then served in the Netherlands as a volunteer under the Duke of Alba from 1567 to 1570. In 1570 he was sent on service to Ireland.

==Ireland==
On the outbreak of the Second Desmond Rebellion in 1579, Stanley was promoted to captain under Sir William Drury, lord justice of Ireland, who knighted him at Waterford for his service in penetrating Limerick in pursuit of the followers of Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond. He fought in the battle of Monasternenagh and defended the town of Adare. In 1580, he enlisted troops in England and led them to the rebellious province of Munster; but the new lord deputy, Lord Grey, quickly recalled him to the Pale to help put down the rebellion that had broken out in the vicinity of Dublin.

In 1581, he campaigned against the clans of Kavanagh and O&#x27;Toole, and on 30 August 1581 was commissioned to follow the lord deputy in the government&#x27;s campaign against Fiach McHugh O&#x27;Byrne, a rebel leader whose fastness lay in the Wicklow mountains. During that campaign, he was engaged at the Battle of Glenmalure in charge of the rear guard, and covered the retreat of Grey&#x27;s forces after they had been routed from the glens. At the end of the year, his troops were discharged, and he went to England to seek further employment from the queen&#x27;s principal secretary, Lord Burghley.

At the beginning of 1583, Stanley was sent back to Ireland to deal with the rebel Geraldines of Desmond, and was appointed by the Earl of Ormond as commander of the garrison at Lismore; he was also Constable of Castle Maine, which he intended to &quot;&quot;make a town of English&quot;, and granted the lands of the former Killagha Abbey. During this tour of duty he assisted in the pursuit of the earl of Desmond and James Fitzedmund Fitzgerald, the seneschal of Imokilly, and in the final subjugation of Munster at the end of the rebellion.

The defeat of the rebels presented many opportunities for advancement to the New English, those adventurers and administrators who had taken advantage of crown policy in Ireland to establish fortunes for themselves outside of their restricted circumstances at home. Stanley became ambitious and sought the presidency of the province of Connacht by petitioning Sir Francis Walsingham and Burghley, but this was denied. Instead, he was made sheriff of Cork in August 1583, and then assumed the government of Munster in the absence of Sir John Norris. He boasted of having hanged 300 rebels and of leaving the rest so terrified that, &quot;a man might now travel the whole country and none molest him&quot;&quot;.

At the end of 1584, the new lord deputy, Sir John Perrot, sent Stanley north in the company of Sir Henry Bagenal to act against the Ulster chieftains and the Scots led by Sorley Boy MacDonnell. During this campaign, he received severe wounds and was laid up for several months. He had marched with two companies to Ballycastle to join up with a troop of cavalry stationed in Bunamargey Abbey (the burial place of the MacDonnells), after Bagenal was forced to take refuge in Carrickfergus. On 1 January 1585, the enemy took him completely by surprise in camp beside the abbey, when half a dozen horsemen at the head of the Scots foot set the thatched roof of the church on fire. Stanley was forced to fight in his shirt, having had no time to don armour, and was wounded in the thigh, the arm and side, and in the back (he claimed he had turned to his men to urge them on). Some of the horse were burned in the abbey, and the enemy fell away without pursuit, and soon after twenty-four oared galleys of the Scots rowed across Ballycastle Bay while Stanley&#x27;s ships remained at anchor in flat calm conditions. Although he subsequently almost defeated Sorley Boy&#x27;s nephew, reinforcements arrived from Scotland and there was little more to be achieved. Stanley returned to England in October, where his service in Ireland was considered to have been brilliant.

==Leicester&#x27;s expedition==
At the start of the Anglo-Spanish War, Stanley accompanied Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester in the 1585 expedition to the Netherlands, and was then sent to Ireland for the recruitment of troops. He expressed his enthusiasm for Irish soldiers, considering those who had fought under the Geraldine John of Desmond as resolute as any in Europe; in 1579 he had commented that the only difference between English and Irish soldiers lay in the superior discipline of the former.

Having raised 1,400 troops – most of them Irish – Stanley set out for the continent. En route he stayed in London, where it was reported that he had been in the confidence of Jesuits and privy to part of the Babington Plot, and that he had corresponded with the Spanish ambassador, Mendoza, and with the Tower-bound Earl of Arundel. When ordered to carry on to the Netherlands, he tarried in England, supposedly in the expectation of an attempt on Elizabeth&#x27;s life or the arrival of a Spanish fleet. Eventually, he was obliged to sail, but anticipated joining with the Duke of Parma.

In August 1586, Stanley joined Leicester and, with John Norris, took Doesborg in a violent assault. Following his service at Zutphen, where Sir Philip Sidney was fatally wounded, Leicester deemed him &quot;worth his weight in pearl&quot;; in October, with Sir William Pelham he took Deventer, where he was appointed governor of the city in command of a garrison of his own – mostly Irish – troops, numbering 1,200.

The quarrel between Leicester and Norris resulted in a commission for Stanley to act independently of the latter, who had taken over command of the English forces on Leicester&#x27;s departure, an arrangement that prompted dissent from the States General of the Netherlands. Stanley promptly communicated with the Spanish governor of Zutphen, and Deventer was surrendered by him to the Spanish in January 1587, whereupon he and 600 of his men entered the service of King Philip II. 300 remained loyal to Elizabeth. This occurred the day after the fort of Zutphen had similarly been betrayed by the English commander Rowland York (28 January).

Cardinal William Allen published a letter at Antwerp justifying Stanley&#x27;s actions and setting out the case for the assassination of Elizabeth I as an act of tyrannicide, citing Pope Pius V&#x27;s 1570 papal bull &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot;. At the time, the queen had been considering Stanley for honours and titles, including his appointment as viceroy of Ireland; but he was almost certainly in complete sympathy with the Jesuits, which order his brother had joined and whose members sang his praises. Thereafter he plotted an invasion of England – the troops to disembark at Milford-Haven and in Ireland, where bases for the larger operation might be established – but he was disappointed at the countenance he received from the Spanish authorities, although they did award him a crown pension, in the 1580s amounting to 300 escudos per month (the arrears of which he had to pursue in later years).

==Later career==
In 1588, the year of the Spanish Armada, Stanley was at the head of 700 men in the Netherlands, ready to embark with the invasion fleet. After the failure of the Armada, Sir William Fitzwilliam, lord deputy of Ireland, speculated that Stanley might be chosen to lead the Spanish army in any further attempt to invade England. In any event, he maintained his regiment in the Netherlands while travelling often to Spain to urge action against Elizabeth. Stanley drew up plans for the conquest of Alderney in the late 1580s, but these too were cast aside by the Duke of Parma. Philip II remained obstinate in his refusal to deploy the English regiment outside the Low Countries.

In the early 1590s, he fostered numerous attempts to assassinate the Queen, but all of them were poorly planned and easily detected. Patrick O&#x27;Collun, an Irish fencing master, and his accomplice John Annias, who had both served under Stanley, were executed at Tyburn in 1594 for having agreed at Stanley&#x27;s instigation to murder the Queen, as were Richard Williams and Edmund York the following year. Stanley is said to have been greatly under the influence of his former army lieutenant Jacques de Francisco (Captain Jacques), a somewhat shadowy individual, and the Jesuit William Holt, both of whom believed sincerely that the killing of Elizabeth was a meritorious act.

By 1595 Stanley was desperate and suffered a reproof from the Spanish governor of the Netherlands for his violent language against Elizabeth. In December 1596 he helped deliver a renegade Scottish courtier John Wemyss of Logie to the Count of Fuentes. He continued in military service for the Spanish and was opposed to King James I on his accession in 1603, but he soon sued for a pardon and seemed desirous of returning to England. Sir Robert Cecil exonerated him from complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but he never gained permission to visit England and spent the rest of his life in relative obscurity. He maintained a close association with the Jesuits, and when he had fallen out with them, with the English Carthusians.

Stanley died at Ghent on 3 March 1630, aged eighty years old.

==Legacy==
In 1560, he married Anne Dutton, a bride of ten, but the marriage was dissolved in 1565. His second marriage was to Elizabeth Egerton (d. 1614), sister of Sir John Egerton (&quot;black Sir John&quot;), who married William&#x27;s sister Margaret. He had two sons and three daughters; one of his sons, James Stanley, was an associate of the Earl of Arundel in the 17th century, as they plotted to overthrow the Jamestown Colony.

<text>Named meteor showers recur at approximately the same dates each year. They appear to radiate from a certain point in the sky, known as the radiant, and vary in the speed, frequency and brightness of the meteors. As of January 2024, there are 110 established meteor showers.

==Table of meteor showers==
Dates are given for 2024. The dates will vary from year to year due to the leap year cycle. This list includes showers with radiants in both the northern and southern hemispheres. There is some overlap, but generally showers whose radiants have positive declinations are best seen from the northern hemisphere, and those with negative declinations are best observed from the southern hemisphere.

<doc id="205542" wikidata="Q10509" url="?curid=205542" title="Elche">
<text>Elche (, ; , , , is a city and municipality of Spain, belonging to the province of Alicante, in the Valencian Community. According to 2024&#x27;s data, Elche has a population of 234,800 inhabitants, making it the third most populated municipality in the region (after Valencia and Alicante) and the 20th largest Spanish municipality. It is part of the comarca of Baix Vinalopó.

Part of the municipality is coastal yet the city proper is roughly away from the Mediterranean Sea. A small creek called Vinalopó flows through the city. Elche is the centre of the footwear industry in Spain. The main airport of the province of Alicante (Alicante–Elche Miguel Hernández Airport) is located inside Elche&#x27;s municipality, and it serves both Elche and Alicante, being the fifth-busiest airport in Spain.

Together with Alicante and other municipalities, Elche forms a conurbation of some 800,000 inhabitants. The city is noted for its urban Palm Grove, designated as World Heritage Site.

== History ==

&quot;L&#x27;Alcúdia&quot; is 10 km from the current city&#x27;s location and the immediate predecessor of current day Elche. This original location was settled by the Greeks and then occupied by Carthaginians and Romans. Greek Ionian colonists from the Achaean city Helike established their new colony, naming it &quot;Helíkē&quot; () around 600BC. It was a point of resistance against Carthaginian advance in Spain between the First and Second Punic Wars. The Romans called the city &quot;Ilici&quot; or &quot;Illice&quot; and granted it the status of colonia; after a brief Byzantine rule, the Goths took over, establishing an episcopal see.

In 1905, archaeologists uncovered a synagogue in Elche dating back to the fourth to sixth centuries CE. This dating marks it as the earliest known synagogue in Spain, and marks the presence of an ancient Jewish community.
Elche lost importance during the period of Moorish occupation, when it was moved slightly north to its present location. James II of Aragon took the city from the Moors in the 13th century, during the &quot;Reconquista&quot;. The city grew throughout the 18th century and became more important during the 19th century with the arrival of the railway and a booming industrial development of what used to be the traditional footwear industry.

Many archaeological remains have been found in Elche, with the stone bust of the &quot;Lady of Elche&quot; (&quot;Dama de Elche/Dama d&#x27;Elx&quot; in Spanish and Valencian, respectively) being the most important. This may date from the Iberian period (4th century BC). The original is in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain.

Elche was granted the title of city by King Amadeo in 1871.

The espadrille industry developed in the 19th century, eventually becoming the leading Spanish municipality at producing textile footwear. By the late century, local entrepreneurs began to invest in leather footwear factories. The footwear industry grew during the Great War and thereafter.

== Geography ==
The city is known for the Palmeral de Elche, that is an UNESCO World Heritage Site and is the only palm grove in Europe with North African origins and the largest on the continent.

Outside the Elche city domain, other large plantations contain approximately 130,000 date palms. In total, Elche and its vicinity hold 200,000 palms. The Palm Grove ranges over 3.5 km2 (1.4 sq mi), including 1.5 km2 (0.58 sq mi) within the city of Elche.

The Alejandro Ramos Folqués Archaeological and History Museum of Elche has been turned into an archaeological cultural model at a regional level of great importance. Situated in the interior of the Altamira Palace - in the Elche historical center and very close to Saint María basilica - it was opened on May 18, 2006, with a grand exhibition about Iberic culture, among where the Lady of Elche was found - one of the most significant pieces of Iberic art, transferred temporarily by the National Archaeological Museum for six months (from May 18 to November 1 in 2006).

Like a permanent exhibition, the museum offers a general overview of the distinct stages that have been taking place in the city, such as the Neolithic, the Copper Age, the Bronze Age, the Iberian stage, the process of Romanization, the Visigothic era, and the Islamic settlement (current site of the city) until the present.

The archaeological remains come from, among others, the Alcudia site, Elche Park (situated in one of the gardens in the city and which has provided important sculptural remains) and El Arenero de Monforte del Cid.

==== Festa Museum ====
The Festa Museum, about the Mystery of Elche, originated with the intention of showing La Festa to the visitors that come to the city throughout the year. The museum is made of two rooms: the first is where scenic tradition that involves the Mystery is collected, which can be posters, sketches, crowns, costumes, guitars...and the other is a more dynamic room, where new technologies are used, combining many visual images like typical smells and sounds from La Festa. Part of the museum is located in what was Saint Sebastian&#x27;s Shrine, which is also closely linked to Assumptionist drama and was restored for the purpose of creating the museum.

Palm Grove Museum (Palmeral Museum)

==== Museo del Palmeral ====
The Palm Grove Museum, found in a traditional house of the Garden of Saint Placidus (Huerto de San Plácido), close to the Garden of Healing (Huerto del Cura). The museum is dedicated to recognizing the municipal relationship with the palm groves. It shows the origins, history, culture of the palm grove, as well as the uses and its evolution. In the rooms, an overview of the history of the Palm Grove is shown through videos, panels, demonstrative elements and sounds, which continues with a visit to its own garden outside.

==== The Traditional Culture Centre Pusol School Museum ====
The Traditional Culture Center Pusol School Museum was created in the year 1969 as an activity linked to the Pedagogical Project “The School and its Fear,” which developed the study of the purposes and traditions of the Field of Elche (Campo de Elche). In the museum, unique collections are housed that show distinct ethnological aspects (agriculture, business, industry, folklore, traditions, etc.) available for scientific studies at all levels. In 2009, it was included by UNESCO in the Register of Good Safeguarding Practices for Intangible Cultural Heritage.

In addition to these, other museums and places of interest exist in Elche:

* Paleontological Museum in the plaza of Saint Juan Church.
* Alcudia Museum, situated in the archaeological site where the Lady of Elche was found.

<doc id="205543" wikidata="Q1807488" url="?curid=205543" title="Coat of arms of Saskatchewan">
<text>The coat of arms of Saskatchewan, officially known as His Majesty&#x27;s Arms in right of Saskatchewan, is the heraldic symbol representing the Canadian province of Saskatchewan.

The arms, consisting of only the shield, was assigned by royal warrant of King Edward VII on 25 August 1906. It uses the provincial colours, green and gold. The remainder of the coat of arms was requested by the province in 1985, Saskatchewan Heritage Year, and was granted by royal proclamation of Queen Elizabeth II on 16 September 1986.

==Symbolism==
On the gold chief is a lion passant or leopard, a royal symbol of England. (English lions are usually gold with blue tongues and claws; however, the default colours for a heraldic lion on a gold field are red with blue tongue and claws.) The three gold sheaves of wheat, or garbs, represent the province&#x27;s agriculture; the heraldic sheaf of wheat has become a generalized symbol of the province.

The helmet above the shield is gold and faces left, a symbol of Saskatchewan&#x27;s co-sovereign status in Confederation. The mantling is in the national colours of Canada. The crest is a beaver, Canada&#x27;s national animal, holding a western red lily, Saskatchewan&#x27;s provincial flower. The crest is surmounted by a crown, representing royal sovereignty.

Both supporters – a royal lion to the left, and an indigenous white-tailed deer to the right – are wearing collars of First Nations beadwork, from which are suspended badges in the same six-pointed shape as the insignia of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit. The lion&#x27;s badge is emblazoned with a maple leaf and the deer&#x27;s, with a red lily. The supporters stand on a compartment of red lilies.

The motto is : from many peoples, strength.

== Blazon ==
The original royal warrant of 1906 blazoned the shield as follows:

The royal proclamation of 1986 blazoned the augmentations as follows:
