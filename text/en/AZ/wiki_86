<doc id="210085" wikidata="Q1194480" url="?curid=210085" title="Genre fiction">
<text>Genre fiction, also known as formula fiction or popular fiction, is a term used in the book-trade for fictional works written with the intent of fitting into a specific literary genre in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.
The main genres are crime, fantasy, romance, science fiction and horror—as well as perhaps Western, inspirational and historical fiction.

Slipstream genre is sometimes thought to be in between genre and non-genre fiction.

==Genre and the marketing of fiction==
In the publishing industry the term &quot;category fiction&quot; is often used as a synonym for genre fiction, with the categories serving as the familiar shelf headings within the fiction section of a bookstore, such as Western or mystery.

Some authors classified instead as literary fiction have written genre novels under pseudonyms, while others are argued to have employed genre elements in literary fiction.

Romance fiction had an estimated $1.375 billion share in the US book market in 2007. Religion/inspirational literature followed with $819 million, science fiction/fantasy with $700 million, mystery with $650 million and classic literary fiction with $466 million.

==History of genres==

Genre began as a classification system for ancient Greek literature. Poetry, prose, and drama had specific calculated styles that related to the theme of the story. Among the genres were the epic in poetry and tragedy and comedy for plays. In later periods other genres such as the chivalric romance, opera, and prose fiction developed.

Though the novel is often seen as a modern genre – Ian Watt, in &quot;The Rise of the Novel&quot; (1957) suggests that the novel first came into being in the early 18th century – it has also been described as possessing &quot;a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years&quot;, from the time of both Classical Greece and Rome.

The &quot;romance&quot; is a closely related long prose narrative. Walter Scott defined it as &quot;a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents&quot;, whereas in the novel &quot;the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society&quot;. However, many romances, including the historical romances of Scott, Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, are also frequently called novels, and Scott describes romance as a &quot;kindred term&quot;. Romance, as defined here, should not be confused with the genre fiction love romance or romance novel. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: &quot;a novel is &quot;le roman&quot;, &quot;der Roman&quot;, &quot;il romanzo&quot;.&quot;

Genre fiction developed from various subgenres of the novel (and its &quot;romance&quot; version) during the nineteenth century, along with the growth of the mass-marketing of fiction in the twentieth century: this includes the gothic novel, fantasy, science fiction, adventure novel, historical romance, and the detective novel. Some scholars see precursors to the genre fiction romance novels in literary fiction of the 18th and 19th centuries, including Samuel Richardson&#x27;s sentimental novel &quot;Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded&quot; (1740) and the novels of Jane Austen such as &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1813).

Critics have often regarded genre fiction as having less artistic merit than literary fiction, but this assumption has been contested after the growth of fiction that blurs these boundaries and the serious study of genre fiction within universities.

==Genres==

The following are some of the main genres as they are used in contemporary publishing:

===Crime===

Crime fiction is the literary genre that fictionalises crimes, their detection, criminals, and their motives. It is usually distinguished from mainstream fiction and other genres such as historical fiction or science fiction, but the boundaries are indistinct. Crime fiction has multiple subgenres, including detective fiction (such as the whodunit), courtroom drama, hard-boiled fiction, mystery fiction, and legal thrillers. Suspense and mystery are key elements to the genre.

===Fantasy===

Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in imaginary worlds where magic and magical creatures are common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap among the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. Fantasy works frequently feature a medieval setting.

===Romance===
The romance novel or &quot;romantic novel&quot; primarily focuses on the relationship and romantic love between two people, and must have an &quot;emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.&quot; There are many subgenres of the romance novel including fantasy, historical, science fiction, same sex romantic fiction, and paranormal fiction.

According to &quot;Romance Writers of America&quot; data, the most popular subgenres are romantic suspense, contemporary romance, historical romance, erotic romance, paranormal romance, and young adult romance.

The romantic novel is not to be confused with romance as a literary form, which Walter Scott defined as &quot;a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents&quot;.
*Other: Inspirational romance, chick-lit, category romance, women&#x27;s fiction.

===Science fiction===

Science fiction is a genre of speculative fiction dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a &quot;literature of ideas&quot;. It usually eschews the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have at least pretense of science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection has become tenuous or non-existent in much of science fiction.

===Horror===

Horror fiction aims to frighten or disgust its readers. Although many horror novels feature supernatural phenomena or monsters, it is not a requirement. Early horror drew much inspiration from Romanticism and Gothic fiction. Modern horror, such as cosmic horror and splatterpunk, tends to be less melodramatic and more explicit. Horror is often mixed with other genres.

==Critical reception and controversies==
Horror novelist Stephen King was awarded the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 2003, polarizing opinions and leading to debate on genre fiction&#x27;s literary merit. Negative comments about genre fiction have sparked responses from &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Salon&quot;, &quot;the Atlantic&quot;, and the &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot;. Nobel laureate Doris Lessing described science fiction as &quot;some of the best social fiction of our time&quot;, and called Greg Bear, author of &quot;Blood Music&quot;, &quot;a great writer&quot;.

In the 2000s, the BBC defended itself against charges that it discussed genre fiction with a &quot;sneering derogatory tone&quot;. The Man Booker Prize and British Book Awards have been criticized for ignoring genre fiction in their selection process.

Some critics have claimed that reading romance and suspense thrillers makes readers more sensitive, because these novels focus on interpersonal relationships.

==19th-century British and Irish genre fiction==

Sir John Barrow&#x27;s descriptive 1831 account of the Mutiny on the Bounty immortalised the Royal Navy ship and her people. The legend of Dick Turpin was popularised when the 18th-century English highwayman&#x27;s exploits appeared in the novel &quot;Rookwood&quot; in 1834.

Although pre-dated by John Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;The King of the Golden River&quot; in 1841, the history of the modern fantasy genre is generally said to begin with George MacDonald, the influential author of &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot; and &quot;Phantastes&quot; (1858). William Morris was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the nineteenth century. Wilkie Collins&#x27; epistolary novel &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (1868) is generally considered the first detective novel in the English language, while &quot;The Woman in White&quot; is regarded as one of the finest sensation novels. H. G. Wells&#x27;s (1866–1946) writing career began in the 1890s with science fiction novels like &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1895), and &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1898) which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by Martians, and Wells is seen, along with Frenchman Jules Verne (1828–1905), as a major figure in the development of the science fiction genre.

Penny dreadful publications were an alternative to mainstream works, and were aimed at working class adolescents, introducing the infamous Sweeney Todd. The premier ghost story writer of the 19th century was the Irish writer Sheridan Le Fanu. His works include the macabre mystery novel &quot;Uncle Silas&quot; 1865, and his Gothic novella &quot;Carmilla&quot; 1872, which tells the story of a young woman&#x27;s susceptibility to the attentions of a female vampire. The vampire genre fiction began with John William Polidori&#x27;s &quot;The Vampyre&quot; (1819). This short story was inspired by the life of Lord Byron and his poem &quot;The Giaour&quot;. An important later work is &quot;Varney the Vampire&quot; (1845), where many standard vampire conventions originated: Varney has fangs, leaves two puncture wounds on the neck of his victims, and has hypnotic powers and superhuman strength. Varney was also the first example of the &quot;sympathetic vampire&quot;, who loathes his condition but is a slave to it. Bram Stoker, yet another Irish writer, was the author of the seminal horror work &quot;Dracula&quot; and featured as its primary antagonist the vampire Count Dracula, with the vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing his arch-enemy. &quot;Dracula&quot; has been attributed to a number of literary genres including vampire literature, horror fiction, gothic novel and invasion literature.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes is a brilliant London-based &quot;consulting detective&quot;, famous for his intellectual prowess, skilful use of astute observation, deductive reasoning and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Holmes&#x27; archenemy Professor Moriarty, is widely considered to be the first true example of a supervillain, while Sherlock Holmes has become a by-word for a detective. Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes, from 1880 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914. All but four Conan Doyle stories are narrated by Holmes&#x27; friend, assistant, and biographer, Dr John H. Watson.

==20th-century genre fiction==
===Early 20th century===
Erskine Childers&#x27; &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot; (1903) defined the spy novel and Follett has also called it &quot;the first modern thriller&quot;.

Emma Orczy&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1903) was originally a highly successful play, when staged in London in 1905. The novel &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; was published soon after the play opened and was an immediate success. Orczy gained a following of readers in Britain and throughout the world. The popularity of the novel, which recounted the adventures of a member of the English gentry in the French Revolutionary period, encouraged her to write a number of sequels for her &quot;reckless daredevil&quot; over the next 35 years. The play was performed to great acclaim in France, Italy, Germany and Spain, while the novel was translated into 16 languages. Subsequently, the story has been adapted for television, film, a musical and other media. Baroness Orczy&#x27;s character &quot;The Old Man in the Corner&quot; (1908) was among the earliest armchair detectives to be created. Her short stories about &quot;Lady Molly of Scotland Yard&quot; (1910) were an early example of a female detective as main character.

John Buchan wrote the adventure novels on &quot;Prester John&quot; (1910) and four novels telling the adventures of Richard Hannay, of which the first, &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; (1915) is the best known. Novels featuring a gentleman adventurer were popular in the interwar period, exemplified by the series of H. C. McNeile with &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; (1920) and Leslie Charteris, whose many books chronicled the adventures of Simon Templar, alias &quot;The Saint&quot;.

The medievalist scholar M. R. James wrote highly regarded ghost stories (1904–1928) in contemporary settings.

This was called the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. Agatha Christie, a writer of crime novels, short stories and plays, is best remembered for her 80 detective novels and her successful West End theatre plays. Christie&#x27;s works, particularly those featuring the detectives Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, made her one of the most important and innovative writers in the development of the genre. Her most influential novels include &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; (1926); one of her most controversial novels, its innovative twist ending had a significant impact on the genre), &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1934), &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1937) and &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (1939). Other female writers dubbed &quot;Queens of crime&quot; include Dorothy L. Sayers (gentleman detective, Lord Peter Wimsey), Margery Allingham (Albert Campion, supposedly created as a parody of Sayers&#x27; Wimsey,) and New Zealander Ngaio Marsh (Roderick Alleyn). Georgette Heyer recreated the historical romance genre since 1921, and also wrote detective fiction (1932–1953).

A major work of science fiction, from the early 20th century, is &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot; by Scottish writer David Lindsay, first published in 1920. It combines fantasy, philosophy, and science fiction in an exploration of the nature of good and evil and their relationship with existence. It has been described by critic and philosopher Colin Wilson as the &quot;greatest novel of the twentieth century&quot;, and was a central influence on C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Space Trilogy&quot;. Also J. R. R. Tolkien said he read the book &quot;with avidity&quot;, and praised it as a work of philosophy, religion, and morality. It was made widely available in paperback form when published as one of the precursor volumes to the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in 1968.

From the early 1930s to late 1940s, an informal literary discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the &quot;Inklings&quot;. Its leading members were the major fantasy novelists; C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. Lewis is known for &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; (1942), &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; (1950–1956) and &quot;The Space Trilogy&quot; (1938–1945), while Tolkien is best known as the author of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1937), &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1954–1955), and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; (1977).

===Later 20th century===
In thriller writing, Ian Fleming created the character James Bond 007 in January 1952, while on holiday at his Jamaican estate, Goldeneye. Fleming chronicled Bond&#x27;s adventures in twelve novels, including &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1953), &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1954), &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1958), &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1959), &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1961), &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1962), and nine short story works.

In contrast to the larger-than-life spy capers of Bond, John le Carré was an author of spy novels who depicted a shadowy world of espionage and counter-espionage, and his best known novel &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; (1963), is often regarded as one of the greatest in the genre. Frederick Forsyth writes thriller novels, including &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1971), &quot;The Odessa File&quot; (1972), &quot;The Dogs of War&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Fourth Protocol&quot; (1984). Ken Follett writes spy thrillers, his first success being &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; (1978), followed by &quot;The Key to Rebecca&quot; (1980), as well as historical novels, notably &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot; (1989), and its sequel &quot;World Without End&quot; (2007). Elleston Trevor is remembered for his 1964 adventure story &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot;, while the thriller novelist Philip Nicholson is best known for &quot;Man on Fire&quot;. Peter George&#x27;s &quot;Red Alert&quot; (1958), is a Cold War thriller.

War novels include Alistair MacLean thrillers &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1957), &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; (1968), and Jack Higgins&#x27; &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; (1975). Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s nautical historical novels feature the &quot;Aubrey–Maturin series&quot; set in the Royal Navy, the first being &quot;Master and Commander&quot; (1969).

Ronald Welch&#x27;s Carnegie Medal winning novel &quot;Knight Crusader&quot; is set in the 12th century and gives a depiction of the Third Crusade, featuring the Christian leader and King of England Richard the Lionheart.

In crime fiction, the murder mysteries of Ruth Rendell and P. D. James are popular.

Nigel Tranter wrote historical novels of celebrated Scottish warriors: Robert the Bruce in &quot;The Bruce Trilogy&quot;, and William Wallace in &quot;The Wallace&quot; (1975).

====Science fiction====
John Wyndham wrote post-apocalyptic science fiction, his most notable works being &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; (1951), and &quot;The Midwich Cuckoos&quot; (1957). George Langelaan&#x27;s &quot;The Fly&quot; (1957), is a science fiction short story. Science fiction novelist Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) is based on his various short stories, particularly &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (1951). His other major novels include &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Fountains of Paradise&quot; (1979). Brian Aldiss is Clarke&#x27;s contemporary.

Michael Moorcock (born 1939) is a writer, primarily of science fiction and fantasy, who has also published a number of literary novels. He was involved with the &#x27;New Wave&#x27; of science fiction writers &quot;part of whose aim was to invest the genre with literary merit&quot; Similarly J. G. Ballard (born 1930) &quot;became known in the 1960s as the most prominent of the &#x27;New Wave&#x27; science fiction writers&quot;. A later major figure in science fiction was Iain M. Banks who created a fictional anarchist, socialist, and utopian society named &quot;The Culture&quot;. The novels that feature in it include &quot;Excession&quot; (1996), and &quot;Inversions&quot; (1998). He also published mainstream novels, including the highly controversial &quot;The Wasp Factory&quot; in 1984. Nobel prize winner Doris Lessing also published a sequence of five science fiction novels the &quot;Canopus in Argos: Archives&quot; between 1979 and 1983.

Terry Pratchett is best known for his &quot;Discworld&quot; series of comic fantasy novels, that begins with &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; (1983), and includes &quot;Mort&quot; (1987), &quot;Hogfather&quot; (1996), and &quot;Night Watch&quot; (2002). Pratchett&#x27;s other most notable work is the 1990 novel &quot;Good Omens&quot;.

Philip Pullman&#x27;s fantasy trilogy &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; comprises &quot;Northern Lights&quot; (1995), &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; (2000).

<doc id="210088" wikidata="Q1052870" url="?curid=210088" title="Macintosh IIci">
<text>The Macintosh IIci is a personal computer designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from September 1989 to February 1993. It is a more powerful version of the Macintosh IIcx, released earlier that year, and shares the same compact case design. With three NuBus expansion slots and a Processor Direct Slot, the IIci also improved upon the IIcx&#x27;s 16 MHz Motorola 68030 CPU and 68882 FPU, replacing them with 25 MHz versions of these chips.

The Macintosh Quadra 700 was introduced at the end of 1991 as Apple&#x27;s mainstream workstation product to replace the IIci, albeit at a significantly higher price point: by this time, Apple authorized resellers were offering entry-level IIci systems for US$4,000 or less, whereas the Quadra 700 entered the market above US$6,000. Because of this, Apple continued to sell the IIci until early 1993 when it was succeeded by the Centris 650 while the Quadra 700 was replaced by the Quadra 800.

== Hardware ==
The IIci introduced several technical and architectural enhancements, some of which were important in preparing for System 7 (which was then called the Blue project) and would influence future Macintoshes, though some of them came at the cost of compatibility:
* a new, 32-bit clean ROM with built-in 32-bit QuickDraw that consists of two parts: one part that is the same across all Macintoshes, and another area (called the overpatch area) that is specific to each Macintosh.
* discontiguous physical memory that is mapped into a contiguous memory area by the MMU. Some of the System 7 virtual memory functions had to be added to the ROM to support getting the physical address of the memory.
* an optional 32 KB Level 2 cache. The cache card, which fit into the Processor Direct Slot (initially called a &quot;cache connector&quot; by Apple), was later included in all systems at no charge. Third-party cards offered up to 128 KB, but the added cache size yielded little benefit over the base card.
* a first for a modular Macintosh — onboard graphics for an external display. This freed one of the system&#x27;s three NuBus slots. However, because the integrated graphics used the system&#x27;s RAM for its framebuffer, some users used a NuBus graphics card to reclaim the lost memory. Also, it was popular to install faster memory in the first bank of SIMM slots, as this is the bank used by the video subsystem. The onboard graphics supported up to 8-bit color at resolutions of either 640x480 or 512x384. 

The IIci was one of the most popular and longest-lived Macintosh models of the 20th century. For much of its lifespan, it was the business &quot;workhorse&quot; of the Macintosh line. For a short time in 1989, before the introduction of the 40 MHz Macintosh IIfx, the IIci was the fastest Mac available.

The IIci came with either a 40- or an 80-megabyte hard disk.

===Upgradability===
Possible upgrades include the 40 or 50 MHz DayStar PowerCache 68030, a 33 or 40 MHz DayStar Turbo 040, and the DayStar Turbo 601 PowerPC Upgrade running at either 66 MHz or 100 MHz. DayStar Digital, which was bought by XLR8, still holds the Daystar product logo and name for its line of products. 68030 and 68040 upgrades were also made by Sonnet, Diimo and other companies. The MicroMac DiiMO 030 accelerator was a 50MHz 68030 CPU with optional 68882 FPU, in a form factor which plugged directly into the IIci processor direct slot.

When the Quadra 700 was released in 1991, a logic board upgrade was made available for the IIci to upgrade it to the performance level of the Quadra.

===Easter eggs===
An easter egg exists in the IIci ROM. If the system date is set to September 20, 1989 (the machine&#x27;s release date) and the keys are held during boot time, an image of the development team will be displayed.

The signatures of the product design team can be seen in the molded plastic of the case if one removes the motherboard.

<doc id="210091" wikidata="Q2032198" url="?curid=210091" title="Reflexive space">
<text>In the area of mathematics known as functional analysis, a reflexive space is a locally convex topological vector space for which the canonical evaluation map from formula_1 into its bidual (which is the strong dual of the strong dual of formula_1) is a homeomorphism (or equivalently, a TVS isomorphism). 
A normed space is reflexive if and only if this canonical evaluation map is surjective, in which case this (always linear) evaluation map is an isometric isomorphism and the normed space is a Banach space. Those spaces for which the canonical evaluation map is surjective are called semi-reflexive spaces. 

In 1951, R. C. James discovered a Banach space, now known as James&#x27; space, that is reflexive (meaning that the canonical evaluation map is not an isomorphism) but is nevertheless isometrically isomorphic to its bidual (any such isometric isomorphism is necessarily the canonical evaluation map). So importantly, for a Banach space to be reflexive, it is not enough for it to be isometrically isomorphic to its bidual; it is the canonical evaluation map in particular that has to be a homeomorphism.

Reflexive spaces play an important role in the general theory of locally convex TVSs and in the theory of Banach spaces in particular. Hilbert spaces are prominent examples of reflexive Banach spaces. Reflexive Banach spaces are often characterized by their geometric properties.

== Definition ==

;Definition of the bidual

Suppose that formula_1 is a topological vector space (TVS) over the field formula_4 (which is either the real or complex numbers) whose continuous dual space, formula_5 separates points on formula_1 (that is, for any formula_7 there exists some formula_8 such that formula_9). 
Let formula_10 (some texts write formula_11) denote the strong dual of formula_12 which is the vector space formula_13 of continuous linear functionals on formula_1 endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded subsets of formula_1; 
this topology is also called the strong dual topology and it is the &quot;default&quot; topology placed on a continuous dual space (unless another topology is specified). 
If formula_1 is a normed space, then the strong dual of formula_1 is the continuous dual space formula_13 with its usual norm topology. 
The bidual of formula_12 denoted by formula_20 is the strong dual of formula_10; that is, it is the space formula_22 
If formula_1 is a normed space, then formula_24 is the continuous dual space of the Banach space formula_10 with its usual norm topology. 

;Definitions of the evaluation map and reflexive spaces

For any formula_26 let formula_27 be defined by formula_28 where formula_29 is a linear map called the evaluation map at formula_30; 
since formula_31 is necessarily continuous, it follows that formula_32 
Since formula_13 separates points on formula_12 the linear map formula_35 defined by formula_36 is injective where this map is called the evaluation map or the canonical map. 
Call formula_1 semi-reflexive if formula_35 is bijective (or equivalently, surjective) and we call formula_1 reflexive if in addition formula_40 is an isomorphism of TVSs.
A normable space is reflexive if and only if it is semi-reflexive or equivalently, if and only if the evaluation map is surjective.

Suppose formula_1 is a normed vector space over the number field formula_42 or formula_43 (the real numbers or the complex numbers), with a norm formula_44 Consider its dual normed space formula_5 that consists of all continuous linear functionals formula_46 and is equipped with the dual norm formula_47 defined by
formula_48

The dual formula_13 is a normed space (a Banach space to be precise), and its dual normed space formula_50 is called bidual space for formula_51 The bidual consists of all continuous linear functionals formula_52 and is equipped with the norm formula_53 dual to formula_54 Each vector formula_55 generates a scalar function formula_56 by the formula:
formula_57
and formula_58 is a continuous linear functional on formula_5 that is, formula_60 One obtains in this way a map
formula_61
called evaluation map, that is linear. It follows from the Hahn–Banach theorem that formula_62 is injective and preserves norms:
formula_63
that is, formula_62 maps formula_1 isometrically onto its image formula_66 in formula_67 Furthermore, the image formula_66 is closed in formula_20 but it need not be equal to formula_67

A normed space formula_1 is called reflexive if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

A reflexive space formula_1 is a Banach space, since formula_1 is then isometric to the Banach space formula_67

=== Remark ===

A Banach space formula_1 is reflexive if it is linearly isometric to its bidual under this canonical embedding formula_76 James&#x27; space is an example of a non-reflexive space which is linearly isometric to its bidual. Furthermore, the image of James&#x27; space under the canonical embedding formula_62 has codimension one in its bidual.

A Banach space formula_1 is called quasi-reflexive (of order formula_79) if the quotient formula_80 has finite dimension formula_81

=== Examples ===

# Every finite-dimensional normed space is reflexive, simply because in this case, the space, its dual and bidual all have the same linear dimension, hence the linear injection formula_62 from the definition is bijective, by the rank–nullity theorem.
# The Banach space formula_83 of scalar sequences tending to 0 at infinity, equipped with the supremum norm, is not reflexive. It follows from the general properties below that formula_84 and formula_85 are not reflexive, because formula_84 is isomorphic to the dual of formula_83 and formula_85 is isomorphic to the dual of formula_89
# All Hilbert spaces are reflexive, as are the Lp spaces formula_90 for formula_91 More generally: all uniformly convex Banach spaces are reflexive according to the Milman–Pettis theorem. The formula_92 and formula_93 spaces are not reflexive (unless they are finite dimensional, which happens for example when formula_94 is a measure on a finite set). Likewise, the Banach space formula_95 of continuous functions on formula_96 is not reflexive.
# The spaces formula_97 of operators in the Schatten class on a Hilbert space formula_98 are uniformly convex, hence reflexive, when formula_91 When the dimension of formula_98 is infinite, then formula_101 (the trace class) is not reflexive, because it contains a subspace isomorphic to formula_102 and formula_103 (the bounded linear operators on formula_98) is not reflexive, because it contains a subspace isomorphic to formula_105 In both cases, the subspace can be chosen to be the operators diagonal with respect to a given orthonormal basis of formula_106

=== Properties ===

Since every finite-dimensional normed space is a reflexive Banach space, only infinite-dimensional spaces can be non-reflexive.

If a Banach space formula_107 is isomorphic to a reflexive Banach space formula_1 then formula_107 is reflexive.

Every closed linear subspace of a reflexive space is reflexive. The continuous dual of a reflexive space is reflexive. Every quotient of a reflexive space by a closed subspace is reflexive.

Let formula_1 be a Banach space. The following are equivalent.
Since norm-closed convex subsets in a Banach space are weakly closed, 
it follows from the third property that closed bounded convex subsets of a reflexive space formula_1 are weakly compact. Thus, for every decreasing sequence of non-empty closed bounded convex subsets of formula_12 the intersection is non-empty. As a consequence, every continuous convex function formula_113 on a closed convex subset formula_114 of formula_12 such that the set
formula_116
is non-empty and bounded for some real number formula_117 attains its minimum value on formula_118

The promised geometric property of reflexive Banach spaces is the following: if formula_114 is a closed non-empty convex subset of the reflexive space formula_12 then for every formula_55 there exists a formula_122 such that formula_123 minimizes the distance between formula_30 and points of formula_118 This follows from the preceding result for convex functions, applied toformula_126 Note that while the minimal distance between formula_30 and formula_114 is uniquely defined by formula_129 the point formula_130 is not. The closest point formula_130 is unique when formula_1 is uniformly convex.

A reflexive Banach space is separable if and only if its continuous dual is separable. This follows from the fact that for every normed space formula_133 separability of the continuous dual formula_134 implies separability of formula_135

=== Super-reflexive space ===

Informally, a super-reflexive Banach space formula_1 has the following property: given an arbitrary Banach space formula_133 if all finite-dimensional subspaces of formula_107 have a very similar copy sitting somewhere in formula_12 then formula_107 must be reflexive. By this definition, the space formula_1 itself must be reflexive. As an elementary example, every Banach space formula_107 whose two dimensional subspaces are isometric to subspaces of formula_143 satisfies the parallelogram law, hence 
formula_107 is a Hilbert space, therefore formula_107 is reflexive. So formula_146 is super-reflexive.

The formal definition does not use isometries, but almost isometries. A Banach space formula_107 is finitely representable 
in a Banach space formula_1 if for every finite-dimensional subspace formula_149 of formula_107 and every formula_151 there is a subspace formula_152 of formula_1 such that the multiplicative Banach–Mazur distance between formula_152 and formula_149 satisfies
formula_156

A Banach space finitely representable in formula_146 is a Hilbert space. Every Banach space is finitely representable in formula_158 The Lp space formula_159 is finitely representable in formula_160

A Banach space formula_1 is super-reflexive if all Banach spaces formula_107 finitely representable in formula_1 are reflexive, or, in other words, if no non-reflexive space formula_107 is finitely representable in formula_51 The notion of ultraproduct of a family of Banach spaces 
allows for a concise definition: the Banach space formula_1 is super-reflexive when its ultrapowers are reflexive.

James proved that a space is super-reflexive if and only if its dual is super-reflexive.

=== Finite trees in Banach spaces ===

One of James&#x27; characterizations of super-reflexivity uses the growth of separated trees.
The description of a vectorial binary tree begins with a rooted binary tree labeled by vectors: a tree of height formula_167 in a Banach space formula_1 is a family of formula_169 vectors of formula_12 that can be organized in successive levels, starting with level 0 that consists of a single vector formula_171 the root of the tree, followed, for formula_172 by a family of formula_1732 vectors forming level formula_174
formula_175
that are the children of vertices of level formula_176 In addition to the tree structure, it is required here that each vector that is an internal vertex of the tree be the midpoint between its two children:
formula_177

Given a positive real number formula_117 the tree is said to be formula_179-separated if for every internal vertex, the two children are formula_179-separated in the given space norm:
formula_181

Theorem.
The Banach space formula_1 is super-reflexive if and only if for every formula_183 there is a number formula_184 such that every formula_179-separated tree contained in the unit ball of formula_1 has height less than formula_187

Uniformly convex spaces are super-reflexive.
Let formula_1 be uniformly convex, with modulus of convexity formula_189 and let formula_179 be a real number in formula_191 By the properties of the modulus of convexity, a formula_179-separated tree of height formula_193 contained in the unit ball, must have all points of level formula_194 contained in the ball of radius formula_195 By induction, it follows that all points of level formula_196 are contained in the ball of radius
formula_197

If the height formula_167 was so large that 
formula_199
then the two points formula_200 of the first level could not be formula_179-separated, contrary to the assumption. This gives the required bound formula_202 function of formula_203 only.

Using the tree-characterization, Enflo proved 
that super-reflexive Banach spaces admit an equivalent uniformly convex norm. Trees in a Banach space are a special instance of vector-valued martingales. Adding techniques from scalar martingale theory, Pisier improved Enflo&#x27;s result by showing that a super-reflexive space formula_1 admits an equivalent uniformly convex norm for which the modulus of convexity satisfies, for some constant formula_205 and some real number formula_206
formula_207

== Reflexive locally convex spaces ==

The notion of reflexive Banach space can be generalized to topological vector spaces in the following way.

Let formula_1 be a topological vector space over a number field formula_209 (of real numbers formula_210 or complex numbers formula_211). Consider its strong dual space formula_212 which consists of all continuous linear functionals formula_46 and is equipped with the strong topology formula_214 that is, the topology of uniform convergence on bounded subsets in formula_51 The space formula_10 is a topological vector space (to be more precise, a locally convex space), so one can consider its strong dual space formula_217 which is called the strong bidual space for formula_51 It consists of all continuous linear functionals formula_219 and is equipped with the strong topology formula_220 Each vector formula_55 generates a map formula_222 by the following formula:
formula_223
This is a continuous linear functional on formula_212 that is, formula_225 This induces a map called the evaluation map:
formula_226
This map is linear. If formula_1 is locally convex, from the Hahn–Banach theorem it follows that formula_62 is injective and open (that is, for each neighbourhood of zero formula_229 in formula_1 there is a neighbourhood of zero formula_231 in formula_232 such that formula_233). But it can be non-surjective and/or discontinuous.

A locally convex space formula_1 is called 
* semi-reflexive if the evaluation map formula_235 is surjective (hence bijective),
* reflexive if the evaluation map formula_235 is surjective and continuous (in this case formula_62 is an isomorphism of topological vector spaces).



=== Semireflexive spaces ===
==== Characterizations ====

If formula_1 is a Hausdorff locally convex space then the following are equivalent:
#formula_1 is semireflexive;
#The weak topology on formula_1 had the Heine-Borel property (that is, for the weak topology formula_241 every closed and bounded subset of formula_242 is weakly compact). 
#If linear form on formula_13 that continuous when formula_13 has the strong dual topology, then it is continuous when formula_13 has the weak topology; 
#formula_246 is barreled; 
#formula_1 with the weak topology formula_248 is quasi-complete.

=== Characterizations of reflexive spaces ===

If formula_1 is a Hausdorff locally convex space then the following are equivalent:
#formula_1 is reflexive;
#formula_1 is semireflexive and infrabarreled;
#formula_1 is semireflexive and barreled;
#formula_1 is barreled and the weak topology on formula_1 had the Heine-Borel property (that is, for the weak topology formula_255 every closed and bounded subset of formula_242 is weakly compact).
#formula_1 is semireflexive and quasibarrelled.

If formula_1 is a normed space then the following are equivalent:
#formula_1 is reflexive;
#The closed unit ball is compact when formula_1 has the weak topology formula_261
#formula_1 is a Banach space and formula_10 is reflexive.
#Every sequence formula_264 with formula_265 for all formula_167 of nonempty closed bounded convex subsets of formula_1 has nonempty intersection.

=== Sufficient conditions ===

;Normed spaces

A normed space that is semireflexive is a reflexive Banach space.
A closed vector subspace of a reflexive Banach space is reflexive.

Let formula_1 be a Banach space and formula_269 a closed vector subspace of formula_51 If two of formula_271 and formula_272 are reflexive then they all are. This is why reflexivity is referred to as a .

;Topological vector spaces

If a barreled locally convex Hausdorff space is semireflexive then it is reflexive.

The strong dual of a reflexive space is reflexive.Every Montel space is reflexive. And the strong dual of a Montel space is a Montel space (and thus is reflexive).

=== Properties ===

A locally convex Hausdorff reflexive space is barrelled.
If formula_1 is a normed space then formula_274 is an isometry onto a closed subspace of formula_275 This isometry can be expressed by:
formula_276

Suppose that formula_1 is a normed space and formula_24 is its bidual equipped with the bidual norm. Then the unit ball of formula_12 
formula_280 
is dense in the unit ball 
formula_281 
of formula_24 for the weak topology formula_283

=== Examples ===

=== Counter-examples ===

*There exists a non-reflexive locally convex TVS whose strong dual is reflexive.

== Other types of reflexivity ==

A stereotype space, or polar reflexive space, is defined as a topological vector space (TVS) satisfying a similar condition of reflexivity, but with the topology of uniform convergence on totally bounded subsets (instead of bounded subsets) in the definition of dual space formula_284 More precisely, a TVS formula_1 is called polar reflexive or stereotype if the evaluation map into the second dual space
formula_286
is an isomorphism of topological vector spaces. Here the stereotype dual space formula_287 is defined as the space of continuous linear functionals formula_13 endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on totally bounded sets in formula_1 (and the &quot;stereotype second dual space&quot; formula_290 is the space dual to formula_291 in the same sense).

In contrast to the classical reflexive spaces the class Ste of stereotype spaces is very wide (it contains, in particular, all Fréchet spaces and thus, all Banach spaces), it forms a closed monoidal category, and it admits standard operations (defined inside of Ste) of constructing new spaces, like taking closed subspaces, quotient spaces, projective and injective limits, the space of operators, tensor products, etc. The category Ste have applications in duality theory for non-commutative groups.

Similarly, one can replace the class of bounded (and totally bounded) subsets in formula_1 in the definition of dual space formula_5 by other classes of subsets, for example, by the class of compact subsets in formula_1 – the spaces defined by the corresponding reflexivity condition are called , and they form an even wider class than Ste, but it is not clear (2012), whether this class forms a category with properties similar to those of Ste.

<doc id="210092" wikidata="Q337436" url="?curid=210092" title="Sanzō Nosaka">
<text>was a Japanese writer, editor, labor organizer, communist agent, politician, and university professor and a founder of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP). He was the son of a wealthy Japanese merchant, and attended Keio University. While in university, Nosaka became interested in social movements, and joined a moderate labor organization after graduation, working as a research staff member, and as a writer and editor of the organization&#x27;s magazine. He traveled to Britain in 1919 to study political economy, where he deepened his studies of Marxism and became a confirmed communist. Nosaka was a founding member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, but his activity within British communist circles led to him being deported from Britain in 1921.

After leaving Britain, Nosaka traveled through the Soviet Union (USSR). He returned to Japan in 1922, where he co-founded the Japanese Communist Party (JCP). Nosaka became a labor organizer, but was arrested twice by the Japanese government for his activities. After being released from prison a second time, Nosaka secretly returned to the USSR in 1931, where he became an agent of the Comintern. He traveled to the West Coast of the United States, where he worked as a spy from 1934 to 1938.

After leaving the United States, Nosaka worked in China from 1940 to 1945, supporting the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) by encouraging and recruiting captured Japanese soldiers to support and fight for the Chinese communists against the Imperial Japanese Army, and coordinating a spy network that operated throughout Japanese-occupied China. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Nosaka returned to Japan with hundreds of other Japanese communists, where he led the Japanese Communist Party during the occupation of Japan.

Nosaka attempted to brand the JCP as a &quot;lovable&quot; populist party supporting Japan&#x27;s peaceful transition to socialism, but his strategy was criticized within the party and within the Soviet Union. During the Korean War the JCP temporarily endorsed violence, and Nosaka disappeared from public life and went underground. He re-emerged to lead the JCP again in 1955, after which he attempted to disrupt the US-Japan Security Treaty by organizing public demonstrations, but he generally supported the JCP&#x27;s role as a peaceful party. In 1958 Nosaka became Chairman of the JCP, a position he held until retirement at the age of 90, after which he was declared Honorary Chairman. Nosaka joined the faculty of Keio University, and he was widely idolized among left-wing intellectuals until shortly before his death, when the fall of the Soviet Union exposed controversial aspects of his relationship with Stalin&#x27;s Communist regime.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Sanzō Nosaka was the son of a prosperous Japanese merchant and was raised in a bourgeois environment. As a young man Nosaka was known for his fashionable taste in clothing and for the large dog that often accompanied him in public. He was quiet, serious, studious, introverted, and more comfortable in libraries than at public demonstrations. After his secondary education, Nosaka attended Keio University, which was then considered a &quot;rich boys school&quot;. At Keio, Nosaka became interested in the international labor movement, an interest that was largely supported by one of his professors, Kiichi Horie. Nosaka decided to write his senior thesis on the moderate labor organization founded by Bunji Suzuki, &quot;Yuaikai&quot; (&quot;The Friendly Society&quot;). To research his thesis, Nosaka contacted &quot;Yuaikai&quot;&#x27;s head office, and acquainted himself with its senior leaders: Suzuki initially mistook Nosaka for a salesman the first time they met, but eventually grew fond of Nosaka. When Nosaka graduated from Keio, in 1915, he joined &quot;Yuaikai&quot; and worked for the organization as a research staff member and as an editor of the organization&#x27;s journal, &quot;Rodo Oyobi Sangyo&quot; (&quot;Labour and Industry&quot;).

Nosaka became interested in communism after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. As a greater volume of leftist literature entered Japan from the West, Nosaka&#x27;s political orientation moved farther from the center. The first Western texts on revolutionary social theory available in Japan were mostly on anarchism, but Nosaka also enjoyed Edward Bellamy&#x27;s utopian novel, &quot;Looking Backward&quot;. In 1918–1919 Nosaka read an English copy of &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; brought to Japan by his friend, Shinzo Koizumi. After reading &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;, Nosaka embraced the theories of Marxism.

Nosaka announced his intentions to go abroad to study social theory in the November 1918 issue of &quot;Rodo Oyobi Sangyo&quot;. He sailed out of Kobe harbor on July 7, 1919, and arrived in London on August 27. After his arrival, Nosaka studied political economy at London University. Like many British intellectuals at the time, Nosaka deepened his studies of Marxism, and became a confirmed communist at the university. While in London Nosaka became active in communist circles. He affiliated himself with notable trade union leaders active in London, and attended the September 8–13, 1919 Glasgow Trade Union Congress as a correspondent for &quot;Rodo Oyobi Sangyo&quot;. Nosaka was a founding member of the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1920, and attended the Party&#x27;s first session as a representative from London. Nosaka&#x27;s activities within the Communist Party brought him to the attention of Scotland Yard, and Nosaka was deported from Britain in 1921. After he left Britain, Nosaka traveled through Europe to the newly formed Soviet Union. In Russia, with the help of friendly contacts in the communist hierarchy, Nosaka became influential within the Communist Party. Nosaka was suspected of being either a British or Japanese agent; but, because of his contacts among high-ranking Finnish and Russian leaders, Nosaka was never purged. Nosaka wrote A Brief Review of the Labour Movement in Japan. It was published by the International Council of Trade and Industrial Unions in 1921

After attending the Far Eastern People&#x27;s Conference in the Soviet Union, Nosaka returned to Japan in 1922, and helped found the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) that same year. Nosaka was more secretive about his relationship with the Communist Party than he had been in Britain, and kept his membership a secret from Bunji Suzuki and other moderate labour leaders. After his return, Nosaka worked as a trade unionist and editor of the JCP&#x27;s official newspaper, &quot;Musansha Shimbun&quot;.

Because of his activities within the Communist Party (which was illegal in Japan), Nosaka, like many communists in Japan, was arrested (twice in his case), interrogated, and tortured by the Kenpeitai, but he was released after short periods both times. Nosaka was first arrested in 1923, and released within a year. After his release, Nosaka became more active within the Japanese labor movement. In March 1928, the Japanese police began a campaign to harass and destroy the JCP, beginning with the May 15 Incident. After his second arrest in 1929, Nosaka spent two years in jail. He was released in 1931 on the grounds of illness. The short lengths of Nosaka&#x27;s arrests aroused suspicion among other Japanese communists that Nosaka had given important information to the Japanese secret police, but these suspicions were never acted upon.

===Comintern agent===
Upon his release, Nosaka secretly returned to the Soviet Union, arriving in Moscow in March 1931. While there, Nosaka served as a representative of the JCP, and worked as an executive member of the Comintern. While in Moscow Nosaka helped to draft the &quot;1932 Thesis&quot;, which became the guiding document of the JCP until 1946. Most of his colleagues active in the JCP, who were not able to go abroad, were subsequently arrested by the kempeitai by the fall of 1932.

One of Nosaka&#x27;s friends was Kenzo Yamamoto, a legendary Japanese communist who had been in the Soviet Union with his common-law wife, Matsu, since 1928. Yamamoto had a reputation as a great womanizer; and, when rumors circulated that Yamamoto was engaged in an affair with Nosaka&#x27;s wife, Ryu, Nosaka wrote a confidential letter to the NKVD (dated February 22, 1939) indicating that he believed Yamamoto and his wife were likely Japanese spies in the pay of the Kenpeitai. On Stalin&#x27;s orders, both Yamamoto and Matsu were arrested as spies. A firing squad executed Yamamoto, and Matsu died in a gulag. Both Yamamoto and his wife were formally rehabilitated after their deaths by Nikita Khrushchev on May 23, 1956, recognizing the lack of any evidence that the two were actually spies. In his autobiography, Nosaka later wrote that he had tried to save Yamamoto&#x27;s life.

In 1934, Nosaka secretly traveled to the West Coast of the United States, where he became involved in intelligence work on behalf of the International Liaison Department of the Comintern against the Imperial Japanese government. Nosaka&#x27;s activities included disseminating information to communists still active in Japan, infiltrating and making contact with the Japanese communities active in the United States, and establishing a number of communist front organizations in Seattle, Los Angeles, and other cities on the West Coast. Nosaka worked to gain funding from the Comintern for his activities, and attempted to have other Japanese Communists secretly relocated to America. He planned to recruit American and Japanese agents to send to Yokohama to establish a cell that would operate as a communist front organization. Because the records from this period are incomplete, historians cannot be certain to what extent Nosaka&#x27;s efforts in America were successful. Nosaka worked as a Comintern agent in America until 1938, when he returned to Moscow. In 1940, the Comintern ordered Nosaka to aid communist forces in China.

In May 1943, Nosaka was the representative of the JCP in the case of the dissolution of the Comintern.

==Activities in China==
From March 1940 to the end of 1945, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Nosaka resided at the Chinese Red Army base in Yan&#x27;an, in Shaanxi Province, where he headed the Japanese People&#x27;s Emancipation League (JPEL). The JPEL engaged in the &quot;re-education&quot; of numerous Japanese prisoners of war (POWs) and created propaganda on behalf of the Chinese Communists. Japanese troops captured by the Communists were then used by the Communists in various civilian and military roles, and were especially valued because their level of technical expertise was generally greater than that of most Chinese soldiers. &quot;Re-educated&quot; Japanese troops were instrumental in a number of Communist victories after World War II, including the 1949 Pingjin Campaign, in which most of the artillery fielded by the Communists was manned by Japanese gunners. In general, the method of &quot;re-education&quot; devised and employed by Nosaka was highly effective.

Initially, the Red Army was a purely guerrilla force without the facilities to imprison POWs. The policy of the Eighth Route Army, the main communist force active during World War II, was to interrogate prisoners and then release them. After reports surfaced that the Japanese were punishing Japanese prisoners after they returned, the Red Army&#x27;s policy gradually changed to one of retraining POWs, and the communists began to implement this policy after Nosaka arrived in Yan&#x27;an. By the time of its war with China, the Japanese army was educating its officers and common soldiers to die rather than surrender. Injured soldiers were easily captured, and made up the bulk of Japanese POWs. Captured Japanese believed that they would be killed, but were instead fed and clothed, and began to develop a rapport with their captors.

Besides Nosaka&#x27;s regimen of psychological indoctrination, there were several reasons that Japanese POWs chose to join the Chinese communists. Communist guerrillas took care to develop an early rapport with their prisoners by treating them well. Captured Japanese soldiers were generally moved when they learned of the terrible conditions the war inflicted on the Chinese people, a perspective that they had not been exposed to before their capture. Closer to the end of the war, the growing possibility of defeat created anxiety among the Japanese army. Because of the Japanese military&#x27;s policy to never surrender, Japanese soldiers never received any training about how to act as POWs: upon returning to Japanese ranks, many would face disgrace, punishment, and starvation. Many Japanese soldiers committed suicide after their capture, but those who chose to live generally came to sympathize with the Chinese. The Japanese army was aware of the existence of Nosaka&#x27;s Communist Japanese soldiers, and feared the phenomena out of proportion to their actual threat. Koji Ariyoshi, an American who met Nosaka in Yan&#x27;an wrote that Nosaka was &quot;the Japanese national who undoubtedly contributed the most in the war against Japanese militarism&quot;. The Japanese army attempted to use numerous spies and assassins in order to eliminate Nosaka (who used the name &quot;Okano Susumu&quot; for the duration of the war), but were unsuccessful. Nosaka maintained a network of agents throughout Japanese-occupied China, which he used to gather information about events within the Japanese Empire and about the war.

From 1940 to 1943, Nosaka&#x27;s presence in China was kept a secret. Under a Chinese name, Lin Zhe, he directed the work of the Research Office of the Japanese Problem. His work with the Research Office in Yan&#x27;an brought Yan&#x27;an&#x27;s intelligence information about Japan up to date. Nosaka collected newspapers and other publications from Japan. To research the enemy, Nosaka and his crew took care to analyze current events in Japan and China, which they did by stocking Japanese newspapers, magazines, journals, and diaries that were purchased or seized on the battlefield.

Nosaka&#x27;s Japanese &quot;prisoner converts&quot; fought freely for the Chinese communists once their re-education was complete. In Yan&#x27;an, the Japanese lived normal lives without guards, owned a cooperative store, and printed their own news bulletins and propaganda. Visiting American officers used Nosaka&#x27;s Japanese soldiers to critique and improve their own methods of anti-Japanese psychological warfare. Shortly after Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945, Nosaka began to march with approximately 200 other Japanese Communists across northern China. They arrived at the coast after picking up hundreds of other Japanese along the way. Demanding immediate repatriation from the first Americans they found, they declared their intention to return and work &quot;for the democratization of Japan and the establishment of peace in the Far East&quot;. Although there are no records of the exact number of Japanese &quot;re-educated&quot; by Nosaka who elected to remain in Communist-occupied China after 1945, it is estimated that &quot;the number must have been considerable&quot;.

Nosaka&#x27;s contributions to the eventual victory of the Red Army were not forgotten by the leaders he had worked with in China. In 1965, on the twentieth anniversary of Japan&#x27;s defeat, Nosaka was publicly praised by name by the highest-ranking general in China at the time, Lin Biao.

In February 14, 1945, Nosaka Sanzo (Under his alias Okano) was mentioned in Fumimaro Konoe&#x27;s &quot;Konoe Memorial&quot;. It was a report Konoe had written to Emperor Hirohito in the waning years of WW2. In Konoe&#x27;s report, he called for Hirohito to surrender to the Allies to prevent a &quot;communist revolution&quot; in Japan. Citing threats such as Okano, as well as Soviet Expansionism.

===Japanese political career===

After World War II, Nosaka&#x27;s return to Japan was facilitated by E. Herbert Norman, the Canadian representative to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, who may also have been a Soviet spy. Before returning to Japan, Nosaka gained Stalin&#x27;s endorsement for the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party. Nosaka&#x27;s re-entry to Japan was also aided by the American diplomat John S. Service, who had a history of being friendly to Chinese Communists. Before returning to Japan, Nosaka advised Joseph Stalin to retain the position of the Japanese Emperor, but to replace Emperor Hirohito with Crown Prince Akihito if the Communists ever gained control of Japan.

Nosaka returned to Japan in January 1946, and received a hero&#x27;s welcome by the JCP. He returned to China as a recognized protege of Mao Zedong, and enjoyed the informal recognition as a &quot;roving ambassador&quot; for Japanese communism. After his return to Japan, Nosaka worked to organize Japanese communists. Nosaka&#x27;s strategy was to foster what he called a &quot;lovable&quot; image for the JCP, seeking to take advantage of the seemingly pro-labor American-led Occupation to bring about a peaceful socialist revolution in Japan. This strategy was highly successful at first, attracting for the party a large following within the student and labor movements and among intellectuals. In the general elections of 1946, Nosaka and four other members of the JCP were elected to the Diet, and the party received 4% of the popular vote. Thereafter, the JCP made further progress infiltrating Japanese labor associations and socialist parties, and in the general elections of 1949, the JCP gained 10% of the popular vote.

However, with the fall of China in 1949 and increasing Cold War tensions around the world, the United States initiated the so-called &quot;Reverse Course&quot; in Occupation policy, shifting away from demilitarization and democratization to remilitarization, suppressing leftists, and strengthening Japan&#x27;s conservative elements in support of U.S. Cold War objectives in Asia. At the Occupation&#x27;s urging, the Japanese state and private corporations carried out a sweeping &quot;Red Purge&quot;, firing tens of thousands of communists and suspected communists from their jobs in both government and the private sector.

In January 1950, in response to the Occupation-backed Red Purge and at the behest of Stalin, the Soviet-led Cominform published a tract harshly criticizing the JCP&#x27;s peaceful line as &quot;opportunism&quot; and &quot;glorifying American imperialism&quot; and demanding that the JCP take steps to pursue immediate violent revolution in Japan. Competition between JCP factions to win Cominform approval in the wake of this devastating &quot;Cominform Criticism&quot; ultimately led by the summer of 1951 to a complete reversal in JCP tactics from the peaceful pursuit of revolution within democratic institutions to an embrace of immediate and violent revolution along Maoist lines. This resulted in a campaign of terror in which JCP activists threw Molotov cocktails at police boxes across Japan and cadres were sent into the countryside with instructions to organize oppressed farmers into &quot;mountain village guerrilla units&quot; (&quot;sanson kōsakutai&quot;). As punishment for his advocacy of the &quot;lovable&quot; image, Nosaka was temporarily driven out of the party and forced to go underground.

After Nosaka went underground, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency reported that he temporarily returned to China. Meanwhile, the JCP&#x27;s new militant line was a disaster. A full-blown communist revolution failed to emerge in Japan, the JCP activists were rapidly arrested and imprisoned, and in the 1952 general election, the JCP was wiped out in the polls, losing every one of the 35 seats it held in the Lower House of the Japanese Diet. The JCP spent the next three years gradually backing down from the militant line, finally renouncing it fully in 1955, which paved the way for Nosaka&#x27;s return to power. Nosaka re-emerged in Japan in 1955 as the First Secretary of the JCP. Nosaka was briefly arrested after he resurfaced, but quickly released.

In 1958, Nosaka became the chairman of the JCP&#x27;s Central Committee. He played a part in organizing the Anpo protests in 1960 against the revised US-Japan Security Treaty. In May 1960, as the protests were reaching their height, Nosaka published a lengthy essay in the Communist journal &quot;Zen&#x27;ei&quot; titled &quot;We Will Not Accept the New Security Treaty.&quot; These massive demonstrations forced the American president, Dwight Eisenhower, to cancel a visit to Japan, and forced the Japanese Premier, Nobusuke Kishi, to resign, but failed to achieve their main goal of preventing passage of the revised Security Treaty, which Kishi ruthlessly rammed through the Diet in spite of the popular opposition. In Japanese public opinion, the demonstrations were received as a national embarrassment, and the JCP received only 3% of the popular vote in the 1960 elections.

The Anpo protests outraged and energized the Japanese right wing. On October 12, during a televised election debate, Inejirō Asanuma, the chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, was assassinated by a 17-year-old right-wing youth, Otoya Yamaguchi, who rushed onto the stage and fatally stabbed him twice in the stomach with a wakizashi. After his arrest, Yamaguchi told police that he had hoped to assassinate Nosaka as well. On November 13, 1963, Nosaka survived an assassination attempt while making a speech in Osaka. The perpetrator was 22-year-old Masahiro Nakao, a member of the rightist group Dai Nippon Gokuku Dan. Nakao, armed with a dagger, leaped on a platform where Nosaka was giving his speech. Nakao was subdued by Party members who turned him over to the police.

Nosaka attempted to keep the JCP neutral during the Sino-Soviet Split of the 1960s, though the CIA interpreted that Nosaka&#x27;s party remained somewhat more friendly with the Chinese. On Nosaka&#x27;s seventieth birthday party in 1962, Nosaka received extravagant praise from Beijing. Deng Xiaoping praised Nosaka as an &quot;outstanding fighter of the Japanese people and comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people&quot;. The Soviets sent Nosaka a matter-of-fact confirmation of his status within the JCP, and within a month sent the JCP another letter scolding the Party for not adequately supporting Soviet positions. The Soviets&#x27; measured praise of Nosaka was consistent with earlier Cominform criticism of Nosaka&#x27;s political theories, which advocated a peaceful transition into communism.

After his re-entry into public life in 1955, Nosaka was elected to the House of Councillors, a post that he held until 1977. Nosaka joined the faculty of Keio University, and was one of many prominent communist intellectuals active in Japanese academic institutions in his time. Nosaka remained the JCP&#x27;s chairman from 1958 to 1982, when he stepped down at the age of 90 and took the role of &quot;Honorary Chairman&quot;.

===Scandal===
On September 27, 1992, two Journalists working for the magazine &quot;Shukan Bunshun&quot;, Akira Kato and Shun&#x27;ichi Kobayashi, publicly revealed evidence of Nosaka&#x27;s involvement in the deaths of Kenzo Yamamoto and his wife. On a trip to Moscow, Kobayashi and Kato had managed to purchase a number of KGB documents, which had been kept secret since the Stalinist era. Among these documents was the letter that Nosaka had written in 1939 denouncing Yamamoto and his wife.

The revelations of Nosaka&#x27;s involvement in Yamamoto&#x27;s death shocked the JCP, already reduced to six seats in the Diet after the 1991 elections. &quot;Akahata&quot; (&quot;Red Flag&quot;), a prominent communist newspaper, sent a team of journalists to Moscow to investigate the allegations, and they confirmed the authenticity of the documents.

After the allegations against Nosaka became widely known, he checked himself into Yoyogi Hospital in Tokyo (a common tactic of Japanese politicians facing scandal). When a team of investigators sent by the JCP visited him, Nosaka confessed that the letter was his, but refused to discuss the matter further. The JCP ordered Nosaka to be present for a general Party meeting on December 27, 1992. After some deliberation, the party that Nosaka helped found expelled him by unanimous vote. The Party newspaper reported that Nosaka, when asked if he had any reply to the charges against him, would only state: &quot;I have nothing to say&quot;.

One year after being expelled from the Japanese Communist Party, Sanzō Nosaka died at home of old age. Outside the JCP, Nosaka was remembered for his gentle demeanor, good manners, and conservative sense of style, &quot;just like a British gentleman&quot;. He was 101 years old.

<text>A portrait is a painting, photograph, sculpture, or other artistic representation of a person, in which the face is always predominant. In arts, a portrait can be represented as half body and even full body. If the subject in full body better represents personality and mood, this type of presentation may be chosen. The intent is to display the likeness, personality, and even the mood of the person. For this reason, in photography a portrait is generally not a snapshot, but a composed image of a person in a still position. A portrait often shows a person looking directly at the painter or photographer, to most successfully engage the subject with the viewer, but portrait can be represented as a profile (from aside) and 3/4.

==History==
===Prehistorical portraiture===
Plastered human skulls were reconstructed human skulls that were made in the ancient Levant between 9000 and 6000 BC in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period. They represent some of the oldest forms of art in the Middle East and demonstrate that the prehistoric population took great care in burying their ancestors below their homes. The skulls denote some of the earliest sculptural examples of portraiture in the history of art.

===Historical portraiture===
Most early representations that are clearly intended to show an individual are of rulers, and tend to follow idealizing artistic conventions, rather than the individual features of the subject&#x27;s body, though when there is no other evidence as to the ruler&#x27;s appearance the degree of idealization can be hard to assess. Nonetheless, many subjects, such as Akhenaten and some other Egyptian pharaohs, can be recognised by their distinctive features. The 28 surviving rather small statues of Gudea, ruler of Lagash in Sumer between –2124 BC, show a consistent appearance with some individuality, although it is sometimes disputed that these count as portraits.

Some of the earliest surviving painted portraits of people who were not rulers are the Greco-Roman funeral portraits that survived in the dry climate of Egypt&#x27;s Faiyum district. These are almost the only paintings from the classical world that have survived, apart from frescos, though many sculptures and portraits on coins have fared better. Although the appearance of the figures differs considerably, they are considerably idealized, and all show relatively young people, making it uncertain whether they were painted from life.

 The art of the portrait flourished in Ancient Greek and especially Roman sculpture, where sitters demanded individualized and realistic portraits, even unflattering ones. During the 4th century, the portrait began to retreat in favor of an idealized symbol of what that person looked like. (Compare the portraits of Roman Emperors Constantine I and Theodosius I at their entries.) In the Europe of the Early Middle Ages representations of individuals are mostly generalized. True portraits of the outward appearance of individuals re-emerged in the late Middle Ages, in tomb monuments, donor portraits, miniatures in illuminated manuscripts and then panel paintings.

Moche culture of Peru was one of the few ancient civilizations which produced portraits. These works accurately represent anatomical features in great detail. The individuals portrayed would have been recognizable without the need for other symbols or a written reference to their names. The individuals portrayed were members of the ruling elite, priests, warriors and even distinguished artisans. They were represented during several stages of their lives. The faces of gods were also depicted. To date, no portraits of women have been found. There is particular emphasis on the representation of the details of headdresses, hairstyles, body adornment and face painting.

One of the best-known portraits in the Western world is Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s painting titled &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, which is a painting of Lisa del Giocondo. What has been claimed as the world&#x27;s oldest known portrait was found in 2006 in the Vilhonneur grotto near Angoulême and is thought to be 27,000 years old.

==Self-portraiture==
When the artist creates a portrait of himself or herself, it is called a “self-portrait.” Identifiable examples become numerous in the late Middle Ages. But if the definition is extended, the first was by the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten&#x27;s sculptor Bak, who carved a representation of himself and his wife Taheri . However, it seems likely that self-portraits go back to the cave paintings, the earliest representational art, and literature records several classical examples that are now lost.

==Official portrait==
Official portraits are photographs of important personalities, such as kings, politicians, or business executives. The portrait is usually decorated with official colors and symbols such as a flag, presidential stripes, or a coat of arms, belonging to a country, state, or municipality. The image may be used during events or meetings, or on products. A well-known example is the portraying of presidents of the United States, a tradition that has existed since the country&#x27;s founding.

==Portrait photography==

Portrait photography is a popular commercial industry all over the world. Many people enjoy having professionally made &quot;family portraits&quot; to hang in their homes, or special portraits to commemorate certain events, such as graduations or weddings.

Since the dawn of photography, people have made portraits. The popularity of the daguerreotype in the middle of the 19th century was due in large part to the demand for inexpensive portraiture. Studios sprang up in cities around the world, some cranking out more than 500 plates a day. The style of these early works reflected the technical challenges associated with 30-second exposure times and the painterly aesthetic of the time. Subjects were generally seated against plain backgrounds and lit with the soft light of an overhead window and whatever else could be reflected with mirrors.

As photographic techniques developed, an intrepid group of photographers took their talents out of the studio and onto battlefields, across oceans and into remote wilderness. William Shew&#x27;s &quot;Daguerreotype Saloon&quot;, Roger Fenton&#x27;s &quot;Photographic Van&quot; and Mathew Brady&#x27;s &quot;What-is-it?&quot; wagon set the standards for making portraits and other photographs in the field.Some photographers took the technique to other countries. Augustus Washington moved to Monrovia, Liberia from Hartford, Connecticut and created daguerreotype portraits for many political leaders for the country.

==Politics==
In politics, portraits of the leader are often used as a symbol of the state. In most countries, it is common protocol for a portrait of the head of state to appear in important government buildings.

==Literature==
In literature the term &quot;portrait&quot; refers to a written description or analysis of a person or thing. A written portrait often gives deep insight, and offers an analysis that goes far beyond the superficial. For example, the American author Patricia Cornwell wrote a best-selling 2002 book entitled &quot;Portrait of a Killer&quot; about the personality, background, and possible motivations of Jack the Ripper, as well as the media coverage of his murders, and the subsequent police investigation of his crimes.

However, in literature a portrait of a character is a subtle combination of fact and fiction, exploring the individual psychology of the character in the wider context of their environment. When the subject of the narrative is a historical figure, then the writer is free to create a compelling and dramatic portrait of the person that draws on imaginative invention for verisimilitude. An example is Hilary Mantel&#x27;s &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; (2009) which, while acknowledging the work of the historian Mary Robertson for background information, imagines an intimate portrait of Thomas Cromwell and his intense relationship with Henry VIII at a critical time in English history. It could be argued that in literature any portrait is a discreet assembly of facts, anecdotes, and author&#x27;s insights. Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, written in the 2nd century AD, offer a prime example of historical literary portraits, as a source of information about the individuals and their times. Painted portraits can also play a role in literature. These can be fictional portraits, such as that of Dorian Gray in the eponymous 1891 novel by Oscar Wilde. But sometimes also real portraits feature in literature. An example is the portrait of Richard III that plays a role in Josephine Tey&#x27;s 1951 novel &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot;.

<text>A hunter-gatherer or forager is a human living in a community, or according to an ancestrally derived lifestyle, in which most or all food is obtained by foraging, that is, by gathering food from local naturally occurring sources, especially wild edible plants but also insects, fungi, honey, bird eggs, or anything safe to eat, or by hunting game (pursuing or trapping and killing wild animals, including catching fish). This is a common practice among most vertebrates that are omnivores. Hunter-gatherer societies stand in contrast to the more sedentary agricultural societies, which rely mainly on cultivating crops and raising domesticated animals for food production, although the boundaries between the two ways of living are not completely distinct.

Hunting and gathering was humanity&#x27;s original and most enduring successful competitive adaptation in the natural world, occupying at least 90 percent of human history. Following the invention of agriculture, hunter-gatherers who did not change were displaced or conquered by farming or pastoralist groups in most parts of the world. Across Western Eurasia, it was not until approximately 4,000 BC that farming and metallurgical societies completely replaced hunter-gatherers. These technologically advanced societies expanded faster in areas with less forest, pushing hunter-gatherers into denser woodlands. Only the middle-late Bronze Age and Iron Age societies were able to fully replace hunter-gatherers in their final stronghold located in the most densely forested areas. Unlike their Bronze and Iron Age counterparts, Neolithic societies could not establish themselves in dense forests, and Copper Age societies had only limited success.
In addition to men, a single study found that women engage in hunting in 79% of modern hunter-gatherer societies. However, an attempted verification of this study found &quot;that multiple methodological failures all bias their results in the same direction...their analysis does not contradict the wide body of empirical evidence for gendered divisions of labor in foraging societies&quot;. Only a few contemporary societies of uncontacted people are still classified as hunter-gatherers, and many supplement their foraging activity with horticulture or pastoralism.

==Archaeological evidence==

Hunting and gathering was presumably the subsistence strategy employed by human societies beginning some 1.8 million years ago, by &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, and from its appearance some 200,000 years ago by &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Prehistoric hunter-gatherers lived in groups that consisted of several families resulting in a size of a few dozen people. It remained the only mode of subsistence until the end of the Mesolithic period some 10,000 years ago, and after this was replaced only gradually with the spread of the Neolithic Revolution.
The Late Pleistocene witnessed the spread of modern humans outside of Africa as well as the extinction of all other human species. Humans spread to the Australian continent and the Americas for the first time, coincident with the extinction of numerous predominantly megafaunal species. Major extinctions were incurred in Australia beginning approximately 50,000 years ago and in the Americas about 15,000 years ago. Ancient North Eurasians lived in extreme conditions of the mammoth steppes of Siberia and survived by hunting mammoths, bison and woolly rhinoceroses. The settlement of the Americas began when Paleolithic hunter-gatherers entered North America from the North Asian mammoth steppe via the Beringia land bridge.

During the 1970s, Lewis Binford suggested that early humans obtained food via scavenging, not hunting. Early humans in the Lower Paleolithic lived in forests and woodlands, which allowed them to collect seafood, eggs, nuts, and fruits besides scavenging. Rather than killing large animals for meat, according to this view, they used carcasses of such animals that had either been killed by predators or that had died of natural causes. Scientists have demonstrated that the evidence for early human behaviors for hunting versus carcass scavenging vary based on the ecology, including the types of predators that existed and the environment.

According to the endurance running hypothesis, long-distance running as in persistence hunting, a method still practiced by some hunter-gatherer groups in modern times, was likely the driving evolutionary force leading to the evolution of certain human characteristics. This hypothesis does not necessarily contradict the scavenging hypothesis: both subsistence strategies may have been in use sequentially, alternately or even simultaneously.
Starting at the transition between the Middle to Upper Paleolithic period, some 80,000 to 70,000 years ago, some hunter-gatherer bands began to specialize, concentrating on hunting a smaller selection of (often larger) game and gathering a smaller selection of food. This specialization of work also involved creating specialized tools such as fishing nets, hooks, and bone harpoons. The transition into the subsequent Neolithic period is chiefly defined by the unprecedented development of nascent agricultural practices. Agriculture originated as early as 12,000 years ago in the Middle East, and also independently originated in many other areas including Southeast Asia, parts of Africa, Mesoamerica, and the Andes.

Forest gardening was also being used as a food production system in various parts of the world over this period.
Many groups continued their hunter-gatherer ways of life, although their numbers have continually declined, partly as a result of pressure from growing agricultural and pastoral communities. Many of them reside in the developing world, either in arid regions or tropical forests. Areas that were formerly available to hunter-gatherers were—and continue to be—encroached upon by the settlements of agriculturalists. In the resulting competition for land use, hunter-gatherer societies either adopted these practices or moved to other areas. In addition, Jared Diamond has blamed a decline in the availability of wild foods, particularly animal resources. In North and South America, for example, most large mammal species had gone extinct by the end of the Pleistocene—according to Diamond, because of overexploitation by humans, one of several explanations offered for the Quaternary extinction event there.

As the number and size of agricultural societies increased, they expanded into lands traditionally used by hunter-gatherers. This process of agriculture-driven expansion led to the development of the first forms of government in agricultural centers, such as the Fertile Crescent, Ancient India, Ancient China, Olmec, Sub-Saharan Africa and Norte Chico.

As a result of the now near-universal human reliance upon agriculture, the few contemporary hunter-gatherer cultures usually live in areas unsuitable for agricultural use.

Archaeologists can use evidence such as stone tool use to track hunter-gatherer activities, including mobility.

Ethnobotany is the field of study whereby food plants of various peoples and tribes worldwide are documented.

==Common characteristics==


===Habitat and population===
Most hunter-gatherers are nomadic or semi-nomadic and live in temporary settlements. Mobile communities typically construct shelters using impermanent building materials, or they may use natural rock shelters, where they are available.

Some hunter-gatherer cultures, such as the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast and the Yokuts, lived in particularly rich environments that allowed them to be sedentary or semi-sedentary. Amongst the earliest example of permanent settlements is the Osipovka culture (14–10.3 thousand years ago), which lived in a fish-rich environment that allowed them to be able to stay at the same place all year. One group, the Chumash, had the highest recorded population density of any known hunter and gatherer society with an estimated 21.6 persons per square mile.

===Social and economic structure===
Hunter-gatherers tend to have an egalitarian social ethos, although settled hunter-gatherers (for example, those inhabiting the Northwest Coast of North America and the Calusa in Florida) are an exception to this rule. For example, the San people or &quot;Bushmen&quot; of southern Africa have social customs that strongly discourage hoarding and displays of authority, and encourage economic equality via sharing of food and material goods. Karl Marx defined this socio-economic system as primitive communism.

The egalitarianism typical of human hunters and gatherers is never total but is striking when viewed in an evolutionary context. One of humanity&#x27;s two closest primate relatives, chimpanzees, are anything but egalitarian, forming themselves into hierarchies that are often dominated by an alpha male. So great is the contrast with human hunter-gatherers that it is widely argued by paleoanthropologists that resistance to being dominated was a key factor driving the evolutionary emergence of human consciousness, language, kinship and social organization.

Most anthropologists believe that hunter-gatherers do not have permanent leaders; instead, the person taking the initiative at any one time depends on the task being performed.
Within a particular tribe or people, hunter-gatherers are connected by both kinship and band (residence/domestic group) membership. Postmarital residence among hunter-gatherers tends to be matrilocal, at least initially. Young mothers can enjoy childcare support from their own mothers, who continue living nearby in the same camp. The systems of kinship and descent among human hunter-gatherers were relatively flexible, although there is evidence that early human kinship in general tended to be matrilineal.

The conventional assumption has been that women did most of the gathering, while men concentrated on big game hunting. In recent years, however, this assumption has been challenged by new research findings. Women in many hunter-gatherer societies hunted small game and, in some cases, even participated in big-game hunting. An illustrative account is Megan Biesele&#x27;s study of the southern African Ju/&#x27;hoan, &#x27;Women Like Meat&#x27;. A 2006 study suggests that the sexual division of labor was the fundamental organizational innovation that gave &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; the edge over the Neanderthals, allowing our ancestors to migrate from Africa and spread across the globe.

A 1986 study found most hunter-gatherers have a symbolically structured sexual division of labor. However, it is true that in a small minority of cases, women hunted the same kind of quarry as men, sometimes doing so alongside men. Among the Ju&#x27;/hoansi people of Namibia, women help men track down quarry. In the Australian Martu, both women and men participate in hunting but with a different style of gendered division; while men are willing to take more risks to hunt bigger animals such as kangaroo for political gain as a form of &quot;competitive magnanimity&quot;, women target smaller game such as lizards to feed their children and promote working relationships with other women, preferring a more constant supply of sustenance. In 2018, 9000-year-old remains of a female hunter along with a toolkit of projectile points and animal processing implements were discovered at the Andean site of Wilamaya Patjxa, Puno District in Peru. A 2020 study inspired by this discovery found that of 27 identified burials with hunter gatherers of a known sex who were also buried with hunting tools, 11 were female hunter gatherers, while 16 were male hunter gatherers. Combined with uncertainties, these findings suggest that anywhere from 30 to 50 percent of big game hunters were female. A 2023 study that looked at studies of contemporary hunter gatherer societies from the 1800s to the present day found that women hunted in 79 percent of hunter gatherer societies. However, an attempted verification of this study found &quot;that multiple methodological failures all bias their results in the same direction...their analysis does not contradict the wide body of empirical evidence for gendered divisions of labor in foraging societies&quot;.
At the 1966 &quot;Man the Hunter&quot; conference, anthropologists Richard Borshay Lee and Irven DeVore suggested that egalitarianism was one of several central characteristics of nomadic hunting and gathering societies because mobility requires minimization of material possessions throughout a population. Therefore, no surplus of resources can be accumulated by any single member. Other characteristics Lee and DeVore proposed were flux in territorial boundaries as well as in demographic composition.

At the same conference, Marshall Sahlins presented a paper entitled, &quot;Notes on the Original Affluent Society&quot;, in which he challenged the popular view of hunter-gatherers lives as &quot;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short&quot;, as Thomas Hobbes had put it in 1651. According to Sahlins, ethnographic data indicated that hunter-gatherers worked far fewer hours and enjoyed more leisure than typical members of industrial society, and they still ate well. Their &quot;affluence&quot; came from the idea that they were satisfied with very little in the material sense. Later, in 1996, Ross Sackett performed two distinct meta-analyses to empirically test Sahlin&#x27;s view. The first of these studies looked at 102 time-allocation studies, and the second one analyzed 207 energy-expenditure studies. Sackett found that adults in foraging and horticultural societies work on average, about 6.5 hours a day, whereas people in agricultural and industrial societies work on average 8.8 hours a day. Sahlins&#x27; theory has been criticized for only including time spent hunting and gathering while omitting time spent on collecting firewood, food preparation, etc. Other scholars also assert that hunter-gatherer societies were not &quot;affluent&quot; but suffered from extremely high infant mortality, frequent disease, and perennial warfare.

Researchers Gurven and Kaplan have estimated that around 57% of hunter-gatherers reach the age of 15. Of those that reach 15 years of age, 64% continue to live to or past the age of 45. This places the life expectancy between 21 and 37 years. They further estimate that 70% of deaths are due to diseases of some kind, 20% of deaths come from violence or accidents and 10% are due to degenerative diseases.

Mutual exchange and sharing of resources (i.e., meat gained from hunting) are important in the economic systems of hunter-gatherer societies. Therefore, these societies can be described as based on a &quot;gift economy&quot;.

A 2010 paper argued that while hunter-gatherers may have lower levels of inequality than modern, industrialised societies, that does not mean inequality does not exist. The researchers estimated that the average Gini coefficient amongst hunter-gatherers was 0.25, equivalent to the country of Denmark in 2007. In addition, wealth transmission across generations was also a feature of hunter-gatherers, meaning that &quot;wealthy&quot; hunter-gatherers, within the context of their communities, were more likely to have children as wealthy as them than poorer members of their community and indeed hunter-gatherer societies demonstrate an understanding of social stratification. Thus while the researchers agreed that hunter-gatherers were more egalitarian than modern societies, prior characterisations of them living in a state of egalitarian primitive communism were inaccurate and misleading.

This study, however, exclusively examined modern hunter-gatherer communities, offering limited insight into the exact nature of social structures that existed prior to the Neolithic Revolution. Alain Testart and others have said that anthropologists should be careful when using research on current hunter-gatherer societies to determine the structure of societies in the paleolithic era, emphasising cross-cultural influences, progress and development that such societies have undergone in the past 10,000 years.

==Diet==

As one moves away from the equator, the importance of plant food decreases and the importance of aquatic food increases. In cold and heavily forested environments, edible plant foods and large game are less abundant and hunter-gatherers may turn to aquatic resources to compensate. Hunter-gatherers in cold climates also rely more on stored food than those in warm climates. However, aquatic resources tend to be costly, requiring boats and fishing technology, and this may have impeded their intensive use in prehistory. Marine food probably did not start becoming prominent in the diet until relatively recently, during the Late Stone Age in southern Africa and the Upper Paleolithic in Europe.

Fat is important in assessing the quality of game among hunter-gatherers, to the point that lean animals are often considered secondary resources or even starvation food. Consuming too much lean meat leads to adverse health effects like protein poisoning, and can in extreme cases lead to death. Additionally, a diet high in protein and low in other macronutrients results in the body using the protein as energy, possibly leading to protein deficiency. Lean meat especially becomes a problem when animals go through a lean season that requires them to metabolize fat deposits.

In areas where plant and fish resources are scarce, hunter-gatherers may trade meat with horticulturalists for carbohydrates. For example, tropical hunter-gatherers may have an excess of protein but be deficient in carbohydrates, and conversely tropical horticulturalists may have a surplus of carbohydrates but inadequate protein. Trading may thus be the most cost-effective means of acquiring carbohydrate resources.

==Variability==

Hunter-gatherer societies manifest significant variability, depending on climate zone/life zone, available technology, and societal structure. Archaeologists examine hunter-gatherer tool kits to measure variability across different groups. Collard &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) found temperature to be the only statistically significant factor to impact hunter-gatherer tool kits. Using temperature as a proxy for risk, Collard &quot;et al.&#x27;s&quot; results suggest that environments with extreme temperatures pose a threat to hunter-gatherer systems significant enough to warrant increased variability of tools. These results support Torrence&#x27;s (1989) theory that the risk of failure is indeed the most important factor in determining the structure of hunter-gatherer toolkits.

One way to divide hunter-gatherer groups is by their return systems. James Woodburn uses the categories &quot;immediate return&quot; hunter-gatherers for egalitarianism and &quot;delayed return&quot; for nonegalitarian. Immediate return foragers consume their food within a day or two after they procure it. Delayed return foragers store the surplus food.

Hunting-gathering was the common human mode of subsistence throughout the Paleolithic, but the observation of current-day hunters and gatherers does not necessarily reflect Paleolithic societies; the hunter-gatherer cultures examined today have had much contact with modern civilization and do not represent &quot;pristine&quot; conditions found in uncontacted peoples.

The transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture is not necessarily a one-way process.
It has been argued that hunting and gathering represents an adaptive strategy, which may still be exploited, if necessary, when environmental change causes extreme food stress for agriculturalists. In fact, it is sometimes difficult to draw a clear line between agricultural and hunter-gatherer societies, especially since the widespread adoption of agriculture and resulting cultural diffusion that has occurred in the last 10,000 years.

Nowadays, some scholars speak about the existence within cultural evolution of the so-called mixed-economies or dual economies which imply a combination of food procurement (gathering and hunting) and food production or when foragers have trade relations with farmers.

==Modern and revisionist perspectives==

Some of the theorists who advocate this &quot;revisionist&quot; critique imply that, because the &quot;pure hunter-gatherer&quot; disappeared not long after colonial (or even agricultural) contact began, nothing meaningful can be learned about prehistoric hunter-gatherers from studies of modern ones (Kelly, 24–29; see Wilmsen)

Lee and Guenther have rejected most of the arguments put forward by Wilmsen. Doron Shultziner and others have argued that we can learn a lot about the life-styles of prehistoric hunter-gatherers from studies of contemporary hunter-gatherers—especially their impressive levels of egalitarianism.

There are nevertheless a number of contemporary hunter-gatherer peoples who, after contact with other societies, continue their ways of life with very little external influence or with modifications that perpetuate the viability of hunting and gathering in the 21st century. One such group is the Pila Nguru (Spinifex people) of Western Australia, whose land in the Great Victoria Desert has proved unsuitable for European agriculture (and even pastoralism). Another are the Sentinelese of the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean, who live on North Sentinel Island and to date have maintained their independent existence, repelling attempts to engage with and contact them. The Savanna Pumé of Venezuela also live in an area that is inhospitable to large scale economic exploitation and maintain their subsistence based on hunting and gathering, as well as incorporating a small amount of manioc horticulture that supplements, but is not replacing, reliance on foraged foods.

==Americas==

Evidence suggests big-game hunter-gatherers crossed the Bering Strait from Asia (Eurasia) into North America over a land bridge (Beringia), that existed between 47,000 and 14,000 years ago. Around 18,500–15,500 years ago, these hunter-gatherers are believed to have followed herds of now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna along ice-free corridors that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets. Another route proposed is that, either on foot or using primitive boats, they migrated down the Pacific coast to South America.

Hunter-gatherers would eventually flourish all over the Americas, primarily based in the Great Plains of the United States and Canada, with offshoots as far east as the Gaspé Peninsula on the Atlantic coast, and as far south as Chile, Monte Verde. American hunter-gatherers were spread over a wide geographical area, thus there were regional variations in lifestyles. However, all the individual groups shared a common style of stone tool production, making knapping styles and progress identifiable. This early Paleo-Indian period lithic reduction tool adaptations have been found across the Americas, utilized by highly mobile bands consisting of approximately 25 to 50 members of an extended family.

The Archaic period in the Americas saw a changing environment featuring a warmer more arid climate and the disappearance of the last megafauna. The majority of population groups at this time were still highly mobile hunter-gatherers. Individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally, however, and thus archaeologists have identified a pattern of increasing regional generalization, as seen with the Southwest, Arctic, Poverty Point, Dalton and Plano traditions. These regional adaptations would become the norm, with reliance less on hunting and gathering, with a more mixed economy of small game, fish, seasonally wild vegetables and harvested plant foods.

Scholars like Kat Anderson have suggested that the term Hunter-gatherer is reductive because it implies that Native Americans never stayed in one place long enough to affect the environment around them. However, many of the landscapes in the Americas today are due to the way the Natives of that area originally tended the land. Anderson specifically looks at California Natives and the practices they utilized to tame their land. Some of these practices included pruning, weeding, sowing, burning, and selective harvesting. These practices allowed them to take from the environment in a sustainable manner for centuries.

California Indians view the idea of wilderness in a negative light. They believe that wilderness is the result of humans losing their knowledge of the natural world and how to care for it. When the earth turns back to wilderness after the connection with humans is lost then the plants and animals will retreat and hide from the humans.

<text>Joseph Wilhelm Mengelberg (28 March 1871 – 21 March 1951) was a Dutch conductor, famous for his performances of Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler and Strauss with the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest symphonic conductors of the 20th century.

== Biography ==
Mengelberg was the fourth of fifteen children of German-born parents in Utrecht, Netherlands. His father was the Dutch-German sculptor Friedrich Wilhelm Mengelberg. He was a distant cousin of the musicologist and composer and the uncle of the conductor, composer and critic Karel Mengelberg, who was himself the father of the pianist and composer Misha Mengelberg. After studies in Utrecht with the composer and conductor Richard Hol, the composer Anton Averkamp (1861–1934) and the violinist Henri Wilhelm Petri (1856–1914), Mengelberg went on to study piano and composition at the Cologne conservatory (now the Hochschule für Musik Köln), where his principal teachers were Franz Wüllner, Isidor Seiss and Adolf Jensen.

In 1891, when he was 20, he was chosen as general music director of the city of Lucerne Switzerland, where he conducted an orchestra and a choir, directed a music school, taught piano lessons and continued to compose. Four years later, in 1895, when he was 24, Mengelberg was appointed principal conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra, a position he held until 1945.

In this position, Mengelberg was to premiere a number of notable orchestral works. For example, in 1898, Richard Strauss dedicated his tone poem &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot; to Mengelberg and the Concertgebouw Orchestra, telling journalists that he &quot;had at last found an orchestra capable of playing all passages, so that he no longer needed to feel embarrassed when writing difficulties&quot;. Among other notable premieres were those on 29 March 1939, when Mengelberg conducted the premiere of the Violin Concerto No. 2 by Béla Bartók with violinist Zoltán Székely, and on 23 November 1939, he premiered the &quot;Peacock Variations&quot; of Zoltán Kodály.

Mengelberg founded the long-standing Mahler tradition of the Concertgebouw. He met and befriended Gustav Mahler in 1902, and invited Mahler to conduct his Third Symphony in Amsterdam in 1903, and on 23 October 1904 Mahler led the orchestra in his Fourth Symphony twice in one concert, with no other work on the program. Mahler wrote to his wife Alma Mahler that this programming idea (presumably Mengelberg&#x27;s) was a &quot;stroke of genius&quot;. Mahler regularly visited The Netherlands to introduce his work to Dutch audiences, including also his First, Fifth, and Seventh Symphonies, as well as &quot;Das klagende Lied&quot; and &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot;. Mahler edited some of his symphonies while rehearsing them with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, making them sound better for the acoustics of the Concertgebouw. This is perhaps one reason that this concert hall and its orchestra are renowned for their Mahler tradition. In 1920, Mengelberg instituted a Mahler Festival in which all the composer&#x27;s music was performed in nine concerts.

Mengelberg also founded, in 1899, the annual Concertgebouw tradition of performing the St. Matthew Passion of Johann Sebastian Bach on Palm Sunday.

One criticism of Mengelberg&#x27;s influence over Dutch musical life, most clearly articulated by the composer Willem Pijper, was that Mengelberg did not particularly champion Dutch composers during his Concertgebouw tenure, especially after 1920.

Mengelberg was music director of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra from 1922 to 1928. Beginning in January 1926, he shared the podium with Arturo Toscanini; Toscanini biographer Harvey Sachs has documented that Mengelberg and Toscanini clashed over interpretations of music and even rehearsal techniques, creating division among the musicians that eventually resulted in Mengelberg leaving the orchestra. Mengelberg made a series of recordings with the Philharmonic for both the Victor Talking Machine Company and Brunswick Records, including a 1928 electrical recording of Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot; that was later reissued on LP and CD. One of his first electrical recordings, for Victor, was a two-disc set devoted to &quot;A Victory Ball&quot; by Ernest Schelling.

In 1933, Mengelberg generated negative publicity in what was known as the &quot;Mengelberg Crisis&quot;. Mengelberg had changed his residence to Switzerland to evade high tax rates in the country.

Mengelberg was described by Fred Goldbeck as &quot;the perfect dictator/conductor, a Napoleon of the orchestra&quot;; Alan Sanders writes, &quot;his treatment of the orchestra was autocratic. In later years his behaviour became extreme, and there are extraordinary stories of abusive verbal exchanges between him and his players at rehearsal&quot;. Berta Geissmar records an incident in 1938 when Mengelberg rehearsed the London Philharmonic Orchestra in the &quot;Vorspiel und Liebestod&quot; from &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and he gave them tortuous lectures as though they had never seen the music before.

===World War II and aftermath===
Mengelberg&#x27;s wife died in 1943. The most controversial aspect of Mengelberg&#x27;s biography centers on his actions and behaviour during the years of the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands between 1940 and 1945. His biographer Frits Zwart wrote, for Radio Nederland, of an &quot;interview Mengelberg had given with the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;, the German Nazi newspaper...the gist of it was that, on hearing of the Dutch surrender to the German invaders on 10 May 1940, he had brought a toast with a glass of champagne [and] had also spoken about the close bond existing between the Netherlands and Germany.&quot; Zwart also notes that Mengelberg conducted in Germany and in German-occupied countries throughout the war, and was photographed in the company of Nazis such as Arthur Seyss-Inquart. 

Explanations have ranged from political naiveté in general, to a general &quot;blind spot&quot; for criticism of anything German, given his own ancestry. After the war, in 1945, the Netherlands&#x27; Honour Council (&quot;Ereraad&quot;) for Music banned him from conducting in the Netherlands for life. In 1947, after an appeal by his lawyers, the Council reduced his ban to six years. Also in 1947, Queen Wilhelmina withdrew his Gold Medal of Honor. This notwithstanding, he continued to draw a pension from the orchestra until 1949, when the city council of Amsterdam cut off the pension. Mengelberg retreated in exile to Zuort, Sent, Switzerland, where he remained until his death in 1951, just two months before the expiration of his exile order.

Zwart wrote a two-volume biography of Mengelberg, published in Dutch in 1999 (1st volume) and in 2016 (2nd volume), with an English translation published in 2019. The 2021 documentary film &quot;De lijst van Mengelberg&quot; states that Mengelberg clearly held political sympathies favourable to the National Socialist regime and ideology, as indicated by the presence of copies at Mengelberg&#x27;s villa in Switzerland of such publications as the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; which had handwritten comments in the margins of the newspapers, some of the comments laudatory. The documentary also notes that Mengelberg wrote letters to the occupying authorities to attempt to prevent the deportation of up to 48 musicians and people of Jewish background to the Westerbork transit camp. In 1943, the authorities ceased consideration of Mengelberg&#x27;s requests, having noticed the high frequency of his communications of behalf of Dutch Jewish citizens. 34 of the people for whom Mengelberg advocated avoided deportation to Westerbork and survived the occupation and the war, including 13 musicians of the Concertgebouw Orchestra and Sara Bosmans-Benedicts, mother of Henriëtte Bosmans.

At the 1945 &quot;Ereraad&quot; hearing, the council described these actions by Mengelberg as him acting in &quot;self-interest&quot;. The Dutch veterinarian Aat Tromp, whose father Sam Tromp was one of the Jewish musicians of the Concertgebouw Orchestra on whose behalf Mengelberg communicated to the authorities and who had received protective treatment, has commented in the documentary:

: &quot;Mengelberg redde het leven van mijn familie. We zitten hier als overlevenden door hem. Kan je over iemand die je leven heeft gered, zeggen dat hij fout was? Hij was politiek gezien fout, maar hij heeft niemand vermoord. Hij heeft mensen gered. Dus om te zeggen: &#x27;Je bent een oorlogsmisdadiger&#x27;, dat lijkt mij niet terecht.&quot;

: (&quot;Mengelberg saved my family&#x27;s life. We sit here as survivors because of him. Can you say about someone who saved your life that he was wrong? He was wrong politically, but he didn&#x27;t kill anyone. He saved people. So to say, &#x27;You are a war criminal&#x27;, that doesn&#x27;t seem right to me.&quot;)

== Performance style ==

&quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; (1980) entry on Mengelberg describes him as a &quot;martinet addicted to meticulous and voluble rehearsals&quot;; it also notes that he did not hesitate to make what he called &quot;changements&quot; to a composer&#x27;s scores when he felt it would aid clarity.

Mengelberg&#x27;s recordings with the Concertgebouw Orchestra are marked by frequent use of an unusually prominent portamento, the sliding of the string players&#x27; left fingers from one note to another. The scholar Robert Philip has shown that Mengelberg&#x27;s recordings with other orchestras do not show this portamento, and that &quot;the unusual approach to portamento... was a stylistic feature which he developed with [the Concertgebouw] over a long period of rehearsal, and that it was not a style which could be transferred to other orchestras when Mengelberg visited them&quot; Philip also notes that this portamento required the strings to use uniform fingering prescribed by Mengelberg, and that this was also unusual for the time, when much orchestral fingering was typically &quot;free&quot;, with different players fingering a passage differently. Freely bowed portamento sounded lighter than that we hear in Mengelberg&#x27;s recordings, as not all players would slide on the same notes. Philip mentions recordings by the Vienna Philharmonic under Bruno Walter as examples of this style.

In addition, Mengelberg employed fluctuations of tempo that were extreme even in an era in which tempo fluctuation was more common than in modern practice. While admirers of Mengelberg value his tempo inflections, detractors have criticized them. For example, the musicologist and music theorist Walter Frisch has argued that &quot;in the Brahms performances recorded by Willem Mengelberg, tempo fluctuation too often tends to obscure the broader shape of a passage or movement&quot;. Frisch argues that this obscuring of structure does not result from the tempo fluctuations of two conductors he admires who also used much tempo inflection, Wilhelm Furtwängler and Hermann Abendroth.

== Recorded legacy ==
Mengelberg made commercial recordings in the United States with the New York Philharmonic for Victor (1922–30) and Brunswick (1926–27). In Amsterdam with the Concertgebouw Orchestra he made a series of records issued in various countries on the Columbia and Odeon labels (1926–32) as well as two works recorded for the Dutch branch of Decca in 1935. Mengelberg recorded with the Concertgebouw Orchestra and the Berlin Philharmonic for Telefunken (1937–42). After his death, Philips issued recordings of live performances recorded by Dutch radio services, and these have been reissued by Decca.

In addition to his recordings of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot; and &quot;Don Juan&quot;, Mengelberg left discs of symphonies by Beethoven, Tchaikovsky and Brahms, Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 4 and the Adagietto from Symphony No. 5.

His most characteristic performances are marked by a tremendous expressiveness and freedom of tempo, perhaps most remarkable in his recording of Mahler&#x27;s Fourth Symphony but certainly present in the aforementioned &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; and other performances as well. These qualities, shared (perhaps to a lesser extent) by only a handful of other conductors of the era of sound recording, such as Wilhelm Furtwängler and Leonard Bernstein, make much of his work unusually controversial among classical music listeners; recordings that more mainstream listeners consider unlistenable will be hailed by others as among the greatest recordings ever made.

Many of his recorded performances, including some live concerts in Amsterdam during World War II, have been reissued on LP and CD. While he was known for his recordings of the German repertoire, Capitol Records issued a powerful, nearly high fidelity recording of César Franck&#x27;s Symphony in D minor, recorded in the 1940s by Telefunken with the Concertgebouw Orchestra.

Due to the Dutch government&#x27;s six-year ban on Mengelberg&#x27;s conducting activities, he made no more recordings after 1945. Some of his performances in Amsterdam were recorded on the innovative German tape recorder, the Magnetophon, resulting in unusually high fidelity for the time.

Sound films of Mengelberg conducting the Concertgebouw Orchestra, during live concerts in Amsterdam, have survived; among these are a 1931 performance of Weber&#x27;s &quot;Oberon&quot; overture. His 1939 recording of Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, while not captured on film, was created on a Philips optical system which used film as the (audio-only) recording medium.

<text>Edmund Lee Gettier III (; October 31, 1927 – March 23, 2021) was an American philosopher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He is best known for his article written in 1963: &quot;Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?&quot;, which has generated an extensive philosophical literature trying to respond to what became known as the Gettier problem.

==Life==
Edmund Lee Gettier III was born on October 31, 1927, in Baltimore, Maryland.

Gettier obtained his B.A. from Johns Hopkins University in 1949. He earned his PhD in philosophy from Cornell University in 1961 with a dissertation on “Bertrand Russell’s Theories of Belief” written under the supervision of Norman Malcolm.

Gettier taught philosophy at Wayne State University from 1957 until 1967 initially as an Instructor, then as an assistant professor, and, latterly, as an associate professor. His philosophical colleagues at Wayne State included, among others, Alvin Plantinga and Héctor-Neri Castaneda.

In the academic year of 1964–65, he held a postdoctoral Mellon Fellowship at the University of Pittsburgh. His recorded field of research was &quot;Bertrand Russell&#x27;s theories of belief, and their effect on contemporary thought.&quot; While at Pittsburgh, he met a young Bas C. Van Fraasen and published his first and only book review of John Passmore&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Reasoning&quot;.

In 1967, Gettier was recruited to the faculty of philosophy at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, being promoted to full professor there in 1972. He taught there until his retirement, as Professor Emeritus, in 2001.

Gettier died on March 23, 2021, aged 93.

Gettier&#x27;s fame rests on a three-page article, published in &quot;Analysis&quot; in 1963, that remains one of the most famous in recent philosophical history. In it, Gettier challenges the definition of knowledge as &quot;justified true belief&quot; that dates back to Plato&#x27;s &quot;Theaetetus&quot; but is discounted at the end of that very dialogue. This account was accepted by most philosophers at the time, most prominently the epistemologist Clarence Irving Lewis and his student Roderick Chisholm. Gettier&#x27;s article offered counterexamples to this account in the form of cases in which subjects had true beliefs that were also justified but for which the beliefs were true for reasons unrelated to the justification. Some philosophers, however, thought the definition of knowledge as justified true belief had already been questioned in a general way by the work of Wittgenstein. (Later, a similar argument was found in the papers of Bertrand Russell.)

==Work==
===Gettier problem===

Gettier provides several examples of beliefs that are both true and justified, but that we should not intuitively term knowledge. Cases of this sort are termed &quot;Gettier (counter-)examples&quot;. Because Gettier&#x27;s criticism of the justified true belief model is systemic, some of his examples, that demonstrate the philosophical issues, lack practical plausibility; for example, one scenario hypothesizes that one job-seeking candidate is somehow aware of exactly how many coins are in the other candidate&#x27;s pocket. Accordingly, other authors have imagined more realistic and plausible counterexamples. For example: I am watching the men&#x27;s Wimbledon Final, and John McEnroe is playing Jimmy Connors, it is match point, and McEnroe wins. I say to myself: &quot;John McEnroe is this year&#x27;s men&#x27;s champion at Wimbledon&quot;. Unbeknownst to me, however, the BBC were experiencing a broadcasting fault and so had broadcast a tape of last year&#x27;s final, when McEnroe also beat Connors. I had been watching last year&#x27;s Wimbledon final, so I believed that McEnroe had bested Connors. But at that same time, in real life, McEnroe was repeating last year&#x27;s victory and besting Connors! So my belief that McEnroe bested Connors to become this year&#x27;s Wimbledon champion is true, and I had good reason to believe so (my belief was justified) — and yet, there is a sense in which I could not really have claimed to &quot;know&quot; that McEnroe had bested Connors because I was only accidentally right that McEnroe beat Connors — my belief was not based on the right kind of justification.

Gettier inspired a great deal of work by philosophers attempting to recover a working definition of knowledge. Major responses include:
* Gettier&#x27;s use of &quot;justification&quot; is too general, and only some kinds of justification count.
* Gettier&#x27;s examples do not count as justification at all, and only some kinds of evidence are justificatory.
* Knowledge must have a fourth condition, such as &quot;no false premises&quot; or &quot;indefeasibility&quot;.
* Robert Nozick suggests knowledge must consist of justified true belief that is &quot;truth-tracking&quot; — a belief such that if it was revealed to be false, it would not have been believed, and conversely.
* Colin McGinn suggests that knowledge is atomic (it is not divisible into smaller components). We have knowledge when we have knowledge, and an accurate definition of knowledge may even contain the word &quot;knowledge&quot;.

A 2001 study by Weinberg, Nichols, and Stich suggests that the effect of the Gettier problem varies by culture. In particular, people from Western countries seem more likely to agree with the judgments described in the story than do those from East Asia. Subsequent studies were unable to replicate these results.

What is interesting, according to philosopher Duncan Pritchard, is that Gettier wrote his paper in a bid to get tenure and that he had little interest in epistemology as he never published anything else in the field, and declined to attend a 2013 conference celebrating the 50th anniversary of his article&#x27;s publication at the University of Edinburgh.

<text>Thomas Gibson Nickerson (March 20, 1805 – February 7, 1883) was an American sailor and author. In 1819, when he was fourteen years old, Nickerson served as cabin boy on the whaleship &quot;Essex&quot;. On this voyage, the ship was sunk by a whale, and the crew spent three months at sea before the survivors were rescued. In 1876 he wrote &quot;The Loss of the Ship &quot;Essex&quot;&quot;, an account of the ordeal and of his subsequent experiences at sea. The manuscript was lost until 1960, and was first published in 1984.

==Overview==
Nickerson was born in Harwich, Massachusetts, the son of Rebecca (Gibson) and Thomas Nickerson. His mother was from Nantucket while his father was from Cape Cod. Both his parents died before he was two years old, and he was raised by his grandparents on Nantucket. Nickerson made his first sea voyage in 1819, at the age of fourteen, on the ill-fated whaler &quot;Essex,&quot; which sailed from Nantucket Harbor. A whale rammed and sank &quot;Essex&quot; on November 20, 1820. The first mate, Owen Chase, later wrote about the incident in the &quot;Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex,&quot; a book that inspired Herman Melville to write &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.
When &quot;Essex&quot; sank her crew took to three small boats and set off for the coast of South America. After a harrowing 89 days at sea, Nickerson and two companions were rescued by . Nickerson returned to sea after his rescue, serving on other whale ships. He became a boatsteerer on the whaler , which was wrecked on 11 February 1823.

Nickerson eventually worked his way up to captain of a merchant vessel. Upon retiring he ran a boarding house in Nantucket, which was visited by the writer Leon Lewis, who encouraged him to write down his story of the three months he was lost at sea with the &quot;Essex&quot; survivors. Nickerson did this, and in 1876, he sent an 80-page manuscript, as well as accounts of other adventures he had later in life, to Lewis for editing. Lewis, however, never prepared the manuscript for publication and left it in a trunk in the care of Darius Ogden, a neighbor in Penn Yan, New York. Nickerson died in 1883, seven years after sending his manuscript to Lewis. The trunk containing the manuscript was inherited by Ogden&#x27;s grandson, James Finch. The trunk&#x27;s contents were finally inspected in 1960 and &quot;The Loss of the Ship &quot;Essex&quot; Sunk by a Whale and the Ordeal of the Crew in Open Boats&quot; was discovered. Finch&#x27;s wife Ann, recognizing the manuscript&#x27;s importance, contacted the Nantucket Historical Association. It took another twenty years before it was authenticated by Edouard A. Stackpole, a Nantucket whaling historian. The Finches donated the manuscript to the Association, who published an abridged version in 1984, a century after Nickerson&#x27;s death.

* A 2001 dramatized documentary, entitled &quot;Revenge of the Whale&quot;, was produced and broadcast on September 7, 2001, by NBC, in which Thomas Nickerson was voiced by actor Jeffrey Carlson.
* In 2013, the television movie &quot;The Whale&quot; was broadcast on BBC One on December 22, wherein an elderly Thomas Nickerson recounted the events of &quot;Essex.&quot; The elder Nickerson was played by Martin Sheen, and the younger Nickerson by Charles Furness.
* In 2015, the theatrical film &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; was released, directed by Ron Howard. The older Thomas Nickerson is portrayed by Brendan Gleeson and the young Nickerson is played by Tom Holland.

<doc id="210118" wikidata="Q309961" url="?curid=210118" title="Group f/64">
<text>Group or f.64 was a group founded by seven American 20th-century San Francisco Bay Area photographers who shared a common photographic style characterized by sharply focused and carefully framed images seen through a particularly Western (U.S.) viewpoint. In part, they formed in opposition to the pictorialist photographic style that had dominated much of the early 20th century, but moreover, they wanted to promote a new modernist aesthetic that was based on precisely exposed images of natural forms and found objects.

==Background==
The late 1920s and early 1930s were a time of substantial social and economic uncertainty in the United States. The United States was suffering through the Great Depression, and people were seeking some respite from their everyday hardships. The American West was seen as the base for future economic recovery because of massive public works projects like the Hoover Dam. The public sought out news and images of the West because it represented a land of hope in an otherwise bleak time. They were increasingly attracted to the work of such photographers as Ansel Adams, whose strikingly detailed photographs of the American West were seen as &quot;pictorial testimony... of inspiration and redemptive power.&quot;

At the same time, workers throughout the country were beginning to organize for better wages and working conditions. There was a growing movement among the economically oppressed to band together for solidarity and bargaining strength, and photographers were directly participating in these activities. Shortly before Group was formed, Edward Weston went to a meeting of the John Reed Club, which was founded to support Marxist artists and writers. These circumstances not only helped set up the situation in which a group of like-minded friends decided to come together around a common interest, but they played a significant role in how they thought about their effort. Group was more than a club of artists; they described themselves as engaged in a battle against a &quot;tide of oppressive pictorialism&quot; and purposely called their defining proclamation a &quot;manifesto&quot;, with all the political overtones that the name implies.

While all of this social change was going on, photographers were struggling to redefine what their medium looked like and what it was supposed to represent. Until the 1920s the primary aesthetic standard of photography was pictorialism, championed by Alfred Stieglitz and others as the highest form of photographic art. That began to change in the early 1920s with a new generation of photographers like Paul Strand and Imogen Cunningham, but by the end of that decade there was no clear successor to pictorialism as a common visual art form. Photographers like Weston were tired of the old way of seeing and were eager to promote their new vision.

==Formation and participants==
Group was created when Ansel Adams and Willard Van Dyke, an apprentice of Edward Weston, decided to organize some of their fellow photographers for the purposes of promoting a common aesthetic principle. In the early 1930s Van Dyke established a small photography gallery in his home at 683 Brockhurst in Oakland. He called the gallery &quot;683&quot; &quot;as our way of thumbing our nose at the New York people who didn&#x27;t know us&quot;, a direct reference to Stieglitz and his earlier New York gallery called &quot;291&quot;. Van Dyke&#x27;s home/gallery became a gathering place for a close circle of photographers that eventually became the core of Group .

In 1931, Weston was given an exhibition at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco, and because of the public&#x27;s interest in that show the photographers who gathered at Van Dyke&#x27;s home decided to put together a group exhibition of their work. They convinced the director at the de Young Museum to give them the space, and on November 15, 1932, the first exhibition of Group opened to large crowds. The group members in the exhibition were Ansel Adams (10 photographs), Imogen Cunningham, John Paul Edwards, Sonya Noskowiak, Henry Swift, Willard Van Dyke, and Edward Weston (nine photographs each). Four other photographers—Preston Holder, Consuelo Kanaga, Alma Lavenson, and Edward Weston&#x27;s son Brett Weston—were invited to join the exhibition, each contributing four photographs. Edward Weston&#x27;s prints were priced at $15 each; all of the others were $10 each. The show ran for six weeks.

In 1934 the group posted a notice in &quot;Camera Craft&quot; magazine that said &quot;The F:64 group includes in its membership such well known names as Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, Willard Van Dyke, John Paul Edwards, Imogene Cunningham, Consuela Kanaga and several others.&quot; While this announcement implies that all of the photographers in the first exhibition were &quot;members&quot; of Group , not all of the individuals considered themselves as such. In an interview later in her life, Kanaga said &quot;I was in that show with Edward Weston, Imogen Cunningham, Willard Van Dyke and Ansel Adams, but I wasn&#x27;t in a group, nor did I belong to anything ever. I wasn&#x27;t a belonger.&quot;

Some photo historians view Group as an organized faction consisting of the first seven photographers, and view the other four photographers as associated with the group by virtue of their visual aesthetics. However, in an interview in 1997 Dody Weston Thompson reported that in 1949 she was invited to join Group . She also recounted that Brett Weston, whom she married in 1952, also considered himself a member. This suggests that an absolute delineation of membership is difficult to determine in light of the informality of the group’s shifting social composition during the 1930s and 1940s.

==Name and purpose==
There is some difference of opinion about how the group was named. Van Dyke recalled that he first suggested the name &quot;US 256&quot;, which was then the commonly used &quot;Uniform System&quot; designation for a very small aperture stop on a camera lens. According to Van Dyke, Adams thought the name would be confusing to the public, and Adams suggested &quot;&quot;, which was a corresponding aperture setting in the &quot;focal system&quot; that was gaining popularity. However, in an interview in 1975 Holder recalled that he and Van Dyke thought up the name during a ferry ride from Oakland to San Francisco. The group originally wrote their name &quot;Group f.64&quot;, but as the notation with a slash was replacing that with a dot or period, they soon changed it to &quot;Group &quot;.

The term refers to a small aperture setting on a large format camera, which secures great depth of field, rendering a photograph evenly sharp from foreground to background. Such a small aperture sometimes requires a long exposure and therefore a selection of relatively slow-moving or motionless subject matter, such as landscapes and still life, but in the typically bright California light this is less a factor in the subject matter chosen than the sheer size and clumsiness of the cameras, compared to the smaller cameras increasingly used in action and reportage photography in the 1930s.

The even sharpness corresponds to the ideal of straight photography which the group espoused in response to the pictorialist methods that were still in fashion at the time in California (even though they had long since died away in New York).

==Manifesto==
Group displayed the following manifesto at their 1932 exhibit:

==Aesthetics==
Photography historian Naomi Rosenblum described Group &#x27;s vision as focused on &quot;what surrounded them in such abundance: the landscape, the flourishing organic growth and the still viable rural life. Pointing their lenses at the kind of agrarian objects that had vanished from the artistic consciousness of many eastern urbanites fence posts, barn roofs, and rusting farm implements they treated these objects with the same sharp scrutiny as were latches and blast furnaces in the East. However, even in California, these themes look to a vanishing way of life, and the energy contained in the images derived in many instances from formal design rather than from the kind of intense belief in the future that had motivated easterners enamored of machine culture.&quot;

In 1933 Adams wrote the following for &quot;Camera Craft&quot; magazine:
==History==
After their initial show in 1932, records indicate that some or all of the photographs from that show were exhibited in Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Oregon and Carmel.

By 1934 the effects of the Great Depression were felt throughout California, and the Group members had a series of difficult discussions about the premises for art in those challenging economic times. The effects of the Depression, coupled with the departure of several members of the group from San Francisco (including Weston who moved to Santa Barbara to be with his son and Van Dyke who moved to New York) led to the dissolution of Group by the end of 1935. Many of its members continued to photograph and are now known as some of the most influential artists of the 20th century.

The most complete collections of prints from Group photographers are now housed at the Center for Creative Photography and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

<text>The Nag Hammadi library (also known as the [[Sheneset-Chenoboskion|Chenoboskion]] Manuscripts and the Gnostic Gospels) is a collection of early Christian and Gnostic texts discovered near the Upper Egyptian town of Nag Hammadi in 1945.

Thirteen leather-bound papyrus codices buried in a sealed jar were found by a local farmer named Muhammed al-Samman. The writings in these codices comprise 52 mostly Gnostic treatises, but they also include three works belonging to the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot; and a partial translation/alteration of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. In his introduction to &quot;The Nag Hammadi Library in English&quot;, James Robinson suggests that these codices may have belonged to a nearby Pachomian monastery and were buried after Saint Athanasius condemned the use of non-canonical books in his Festal Letter of 367 A.D. The Pachomian hypothesis has been further expanded by Lundhaug &amp; Jenott (2015, 2018) and further strengthened by Linjamaa (2024). In his 2024 book, Linjamaa argues that the Nag Hammadi library was used by a small intellectual monastic elite at a Pachomian monastery, and that they were used as a smaller part of a much wider Christian library.

The contents of the codices were written in the Coptic language. The best-known of these works is probably the Gospel of Thomas, of which the Nag Hammadi codices contain the only complete text. After the discovery, scholars recognized that fragments of these sayings attributed to Jesus appeared in manuscripts discovered at Oxyrhynchus in 1898 (P. Oxy. 1), and matching quotations were recognized in other early Christian sources. Most interpreters date the writing of the Gospel of Thomas to the second century, but based on much earlier sources. The buried manuscripts date from the 3rd and 4th centuries.

The Nag Hammadi codices are now housed in the Coptic Museum in Cairo, Egypt.

==Discovery==

Scholars first became aware of the Nag Hammadi library in 1946. Making careful inquiries from 1947–1950, Jean Doresse discovered that a local farmer, who was a teenager at the time, dug up the texts from a graveyard in the desert, located near tombs from the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt. In the 1970s, James Robinson sought out the local farmer in question, identifying him as Muhammad ‘Ali al-Samman. Al-Samman told Robinson a complex story involving a mission occasioned by a blood feud, digging to obtain fresh soil for agricultural use and thus finding the manuscripts in a buried jar, hesitating to break the jar due to superstitions about a &quot;jinn,&quot; and—at the mission&#x27;s culmination—engaging in cannibalism with the target&#x27;s heart. His mother claimed that she burned some of the manuscripts as tinder for the family oven; Robinson identified these with Codex XII. Robinson gave multiple accounts of this interview, with the number of people present at the discovery ranging from two to eight. Jean Doresse&#x27;s account contains none of these elements.

Later scholarship has drawn attention to al-Samman&#x27;s mention of a corpse and a &quot;bed of charcoal&quot; at the site of the putative &quot;fresh soil&quot; excavation—aspects of the story that were vehemently denied by al-Samman&#x27;s brother. It has been suggested that the library was initially a simple grave robbing, and the more fanciful aspects of the story were concocted as a cover story. Burials of books were common in Egypt, in the early centuries AD; but if the library was a funerary deposit, it conflicts with Robinson&#x27;s belief that the manuscripts were purposely hidden out of fear of persecution. Instead, Lewis &amp; Blount (2014) have proposed that the Nag Hammadi codices had been privately commissioned by a wealthy non-monastic individual, and that the books had been buried with him as funerary prestige items. The &quot;blood feud&quot; story, however, has been generally accepted.

Slowly, most of the tracts came into the hands of Phokion J. Tanos, a Cypriot antiques dealer in Cairo, and they were thereafter being retained by the Department of Antiquities, for fear that they would be sold out of the country. After the revolution in 1952, the texts were handed to the Coptic Museum in Cairo, and declared national property. Pahor Labib, the director of the Coptic Museum at that time, was keen to keep the manuscripts in their country of origin.

Meanwhile, a single codex had been sold in Cairo to a Belgian antiques dealer. After an attempt was made to sell the codex in both New York City and Paris, it was acquired by the Carl Gustav Jung Institute in Zurich in 1951, through the mediation of Gilles Quispel. It was intended as a birthday present for Jung; for this reason, this codex is typically known as the Jung Codex, being Codex I in the collection. Jung&#x27;s death in 1961 resulted in a quarrel over the ownership of the Jung Codex; the pages were not given to the Coptic Museum in Cairo until 1975, after a first edition of the text had been published. The papyri were finally brought together in Cairo: of the 1945 find, eleven complete books and fragments of two others, &#x27;amounting to well over 1000 written pages&#x27;, are preserved there.

==Translation==
The first edition of a text found at Nag Hammadi was from the Jung Codex, a partial translation of which appeared in Cairo in 1956, and a single extensive facsimile edition was planned. Due to the difficult political circumstances in Egypt, individual tracts followed from the Cairo and Zurich collections only slowly.

This state of affairs did not change until 1966, with the holding of the Messina Congress in Italy. At this conference, intended to allow scholars to arrive at a group consensus concerning the definition of Gnosticism, James M. Robinson assembled a group of editors and translators whose express task was to publish a bilingual edition of the Nag Hammadi codices in English, in collaboration with the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity at the Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California, where Robinson was a faculty member.

Robinson was elected secretary of the International Committee for the Nag Hammadi Codices, which had been formed in 1970 by UNESCO and the Egyptian Ministry of Culture; it was in this capacity that he oversaw the project. A facsimile edition in twelve volumes was published between 1972 and 1977, with subsequent additions in 1979 and 1984 from the publisher Brill Publishers in Leiden, entitled, &quot;The Facsimile Edition of the Nag Hammadi Codices.&quot; This made all the texts available for all interested parties to study in some form.

At the same time, in the German Democratic Republic, a group of scholars—including Alexander Böhlig, Martin Krause and New Testament scholars Gesine Schenke, Hans-Martin Schenke and Hans-Gebhard Bethge—were preparing the first German language translation of the find. The last three scholars prepared a complete scholarly translation under the auspices of the Berlin Humboldt University, which was published in 2001.

The James M. Robinson translation was first published in 1977, with the name &quot;The Nag Hammadi Library in English&quot;, in collaboration between E.J. Brill and Harper &amp; Row. The single-volume publication, according to Robinson, &#x27;marked the end of one stage of Nag Hammadi scholarship and the beginning of another&#x27; (from the Preface to the third revised edition). Paperback editions followed in 1981 and 1984, from E.J. Brill and Harper, respectively. A third, completely revised, edition was published in 1988. This marks the final stage in the gradual dispersal of gnostic texts into the wider public arena—the full complement of codices was finally available in unadulterated form to people around the world, in a variety of languages. A cross-reference apparatus for Robinson&#x27;s translation and the Biblical canon also exists.

Another English edition was published in 1987, by Yale scholar Bentley Layton, called &quot;The Gnostic Scriptures: A New Translation with Annotations&quot; (Garden City: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1987). The volume included new translations from the Nag Hammadi Library, together with extracts from the heresiological writers, and other gnostic material. It remains, along with &quot;The Nag Hammadi Library in English,&quot; one of the more accessible volumes of translations of the Nag Hammadi find. It includes extensive historical introductions to individual gnostic groups, notes on translation, annotations to the text, and the organization of tracts into clearly defined movements.

Not all scholars agree that the entire library should be considered Gnostic. Paterson Brown has argued that the three Nag Hammadi Gospels of Thomas, Philip and Truth cannot be so labeled, since each, in his opinion, may explicitly affirm the basic reality and sanctity of incarnate life, which Gnosticism by definition considers illusory.

==List of codices and tractates==
The following table contains a list of codices and tractates in the Nag Hammadi library as given by . Abbreviations are from &quot;The Coptic Gnostic Library&quot;.

The so-called &quot;Codex XIII&quot; is not a codex, but rather the text of &quot;Trimorphic Protennoia&quot;, written on &quot;eight leaves removed from a thirteenth book in late antiquity and tucked inside the front cover of the sixth.&quot; (Robinson, NHLE, p. 10) Only a few lines from the beginning of &quot;Origin of the World&quot; are discernible on the bottom of the eighth leaf.

==Dating==
Although the manuscripts discovered at Nag Hammadi are generally dated to the 4th century, there is some debate regarding the original composition of the texts. 
# The Gospel of Thomas is held by most to be the earliest of the &quot;gnostic&quot; gospels composed. Scholars generally date the text to the early to mid-2nd century. The Gospel of Thomas, it is often claimed, has some gnostic elements but lacks the full gnostic cosmology. However, even the description of these elements as &quot;gnostic&quot; is based mainly upon the presupposition that the text as a whole is a &quot;gnostic&quot; gospel, and this idea itself is based upon little other than the fact that it was found along with gnostic texts at Nag Hammadi. Some scholars including Nicholas Perrin argue that &quot;Thomas&quot; is dependent on the &quot;Diatessaron&quot;, which was composed shortly after 172 by Tatian in Syria. Others contend for an earlier date, with a minority claiming a date of perhaps 50 AD, citing a relationship to the hypothetical Q document among other reasons.
# The &quot;Gospel of Truth&quot; and the teachings of the Pistis Sophia can be approximately dated to the early 2nd century as they were part of the original Valentinian school, though the gospel itself is 3rd century.
# Documents with a Sethian influence (like the Gospel of Judas, or outright Sethian like Coptic Gospel of the Egyptians) can be dated substantially later than 40 and substantially earlier than 250; most scholars giving them a 2nd-century date. More conservative scholars using the traditional dating method would argue in these cases for the early 3rd century.
# Some gnostic gospels (for example Trimorphic Protennoia) make use of fully developed Neoplatonism and thus need to be dated after Plotinus in the 3rd century.

== Working elephants ==
=== Circus elephants ===
* Fanny, former circus elephant that resided in Slater Park Zoo in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, from 1958 to 1993.

<text>A Schipperke (; ) is a small breed of dog that is believed to have originated in the 1600s in Flanders. There has been a long informal debate over whether this type of dog is a spitz or miniature sheepdog. In their home country of Belgium they are considered a small shepherd. DNA research has shown that Schipperkes have a close relationship to the Spitz family of dog breeds.

== Description ==

===Physical===

The Schipperke is a small, sturdy, usually black dog in the Spitz family. Their pointed ears are erect atop the head. Schipperkes are double coated with a soft, fluffy undercoat that is covered by a somewhat harsher-feeling and longer outer coat. One of the breed&#x27;s characteristics is a long ruff that surrounds the neck and then a strip trails down towards the rear of the dog. They also have longer fur on their hind legs, called culottes. The breed is usually black, but sometimes blonde or cream-colored (some blondes have a silkier coat); very rarely they can have a liver-red coloration. The coat is shiny. Dogs of this breed usually weigh .

== Health ==

The Schipperke has no particular health problems. The UK Kennel Club survey puts the median lifespan of the breed at 13 years old, with about 20% living to 15 years or more. Of the 36 deceased dogs in the survey, the oldest dog was years old. There is a known case where a Schipperke lived to be 18 to 19 years old. Nonetheless, inactivity, lack of exercise, and over-feeding are very harmful, and can lead to joint and skeletal problems and tooth, heart, lung, or digestive conditions. Schipperkes&#x27; primary orthopedic problem tends to be luxating patella and Legg-Perthes syndrome (knee and hip disorders, respectively). Some Schipperkes have demonstrated tendencies to epilepsy, although there are no tests: these seem to be related to genetic transmission.

The one caveat to the Schipperke&#x27;s good health is MPS IIIB, a genetic mutation that occurs in at most 15% of the total breed population. It only occurs in Schipperkes. The University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine has developed a test for the disease and began accepting samples in April 2003. Clinical signs appear between two and four years of age, and there are no known cures or treatments. The disease affects balance, negotiation of obstacles (such as stairs), and is similar to such lysosomal storage diseases in humans as Tay–Sachs disease and Gaucher&#x27;s disease.
The Schipperke is also prone to some other physical problems as reported by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals.

DNA research has shown that Schipperkes have a rising rate of inbreeding in their population.

== History ==
The earlier common references to Schipperkes suggest that they may have originated in the 1600&#x27;s in Flanders.
Schipperkes were first recognized as a formal breed in the 1880s, their standard being written in 1889. Much of what is known of their origins and early history comes from &quot;Chasse et Pêche&quot; (French for &quot;Hunting and Fishing&quot;) magazine, articles from which were translated into English and published by the English magazine &quot;The Stockkeeper&quot;.

The breed name &quot;Schipperke&quot; means &quot;little boatman&quot; or &quot;little captain&quot; in the Flemish language. However while they were occasionally seen on barges it was not their original or primary function, and in the areas of Leuven and Brussels &quot;scheper&quot; (which sounds similar to &quot;schipper&quot;; a German Shepherd dog is known in Dutch as a &quot;Duitse scheper&quot;) was the word for shepherd, making the name translate as &quot;little shepherd&quot;.

Before the name &quot;Schipperke&quot; was officially taken, the breed was also known colloquially as &quot;Spits&quot; or &quot;Spitzke&quot;, a name commonly used to describe a small dog with pointed ears. They were also occasionally called &quot;Moorke&quot;, meaning &quot;little black animal&quot;. Schipperkes are widely referred to in the United States, albeit erroneously, as &quot;Belgian canal barge dogs&quot; or &quot;Belgian ship dogs.&quot; Apparently, however, their history dates to a seventeenth-century black shepherd dog commonly called the Leuvenaar, a 40-pound dog often found in the Louvain region of Belgium and employed to guard flocks and transport. These dogs are apparently the foundational breed for both the modern, and smaller, Schipperke and the modern, and larger, &quot;Black&quot; Belgian Shepherd Dog, also known as the Groenendael.

In World War II, the Belgian Resistance used the dogs to run messages between various resistance hideouts and cells, to which occupying Nazi forces were none the wiser.

== Genetic genealogy/DNA research ==

DNA laboratory studies have shown that the Schipperke is more closely related to the Pomeranian dog than the Belgian sheepdog and is very closely tied to Spitz type breeds. DNA studies also show a steady increase of inbreeding in Schipperkes.

<text>William Prynne (1600 – 24 October 1669), an English lawyer, voluble author, polemicist and political figure, was a prominent Puritan opponent of church policy under William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury (1633–1645). His views were Presbyterian, but he became known in the 1640s as an Erastian, arguing for overall state control of religious matters. 

Recent scholarship has portrayed Prynne as an important Caroline era propagandist whose innovative political storytelling and publishing techniques played a major role in fomenting public distrust of Charles I and Archbishop Laud.

==Early life==
Born at Swainswick, near Bath, Somerset, William Prynne was educated at Bath Grammar School and Oriel College, Oxford. He graduated as a BA on 22 January 1621, entered as a student of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in the same year, and was called to the bar in 1628.

According to Anthony Wood, he was confirmed in his militant puritanism by the influence of John Preston, then a lecturer at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. In 1627 he published his first of over 200 works, a theological treatise titled &quot;The Perpetuity of a Regenerate Man&#x27;s Estate&quot;. This was followed in the next three years by three others attacking Arminianism and its teachers. In the preface to one of them he appealed to Parliament to suppress anything written against Calvinist doctrine and to force the clergy to subscribe to the conclusion of the Synod of Dort.

Prynne was a strong disciplinarian. After arguing that the custom of drinking healths was sinful, he asserted that for men to wear their hair long was &quot;unseemly and unlawful unto Christians&quot;, while it was &quot;mannish, unnatural, impudent, and unchristian&quot; for women to cut it short.

==1630s==
Like many Puritans abhorring decadence, Prynne strongly opposed religious feast days, including Christmas, and revelry such as stage plays. He included in his &quot;Histriomastix&quot; (1632) a denunciation of actresses which was widely felt to be an attack on Queen Henrietta Maria. This book led to the most prominent incidents in his life, but the timing was accidental.

About 1624 Prynne had begun a book against stage-plays; on 31 May 1630 he gained a licence to print it and about November 1632 it was published. &quot;Histriomastix&quot; has over a thousand pages, in which he presents plays as unlawful, incentives to immorality, and condemned by the Scriptures, Church Fathers, modern Christian writers, and pagan philosophers. By chance, the Queen and her ladies, in January 1633, took part in the performance of Walter Montagu&#x27;s &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Paradise&quot;: this was an innovation at court. A passage reflecting on the character of female actors in general was construed as an aspersion on the Queen; passages attacking the spectators of plays and magistrates who failed to suppress them, pointed by references to Nero and other tyrants, were taken as seen on King Charles I.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Cottington, ordered &quot;Histriomastix&quot; to &quot;be burnt, in the most public manner that can be.&quot; As David Cressy has pointed out, this was an innovative act of public censorship. It imported continental public book-burning by the hangman for the first time. &quot;Though not used in England&quot;, Lord Cottington noted, this manner of book burning suited Prynne&#x27;s work because of its &quot;strangeness and heinousness&quot;. William Noy, as attorney-general, took proceedings against Prynne in the Star-chamber. After a year&#x27;s imprisonment in the Tower of London, he was sentenced on 17 February 1634 to life imprisonment, a fine of £5,000, expulsion from Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, deprival of his Oxford University degree, and amputation of both his ears in the pillory, where he was held on 7–10 May. His book was burnt before him, and with over a thousand pages it suffocated Prynne in its smoke.

On 11 June Prynne addressed a letter to Archbishop Laud, whom he saw as his chief persecutor, charging him with illegality and injustice. Laud handed the letter to the Attorney-General as material for a new prosecution, but when Prynne was required to own his handwriting, he contrived to get hold of the letter and tore it to pieces. Prynne wrote in the Tower and published anonymous tracts against episcopacy and the &quot;Book of Sports&quot;. In &quot;A Divine Tragedy lately acted, or a Collection of sundry memorable Examples of God&#x27;s Judgment upon Sabbath-breakers&quot; he introduced Noy&#x27;s recent death as a warning. In an appendix to John Bastwick&#x27;s &quot;Flagellum Pontificis&quot; and in &quot;A Breviate of the Bishops&#x27; intolerable Usurpations&quot; he attacked prelates in general (1635). An anonymous attack on Matthew Wren, Bishop of Norwich brought him again before the Star Chamber. On 14 June 1637 Prynne was sentenced once more to a fine of £5,000, to imprisonment for life, and to lose the rest of his ears. At the proposal of Chief Justice John Finch, he was also to be branded on the cheeks with the letters S. L., standing for &quot;seditious libeller&quot;. Prynne was pilloried on 30 June in company with Henry Burton and John Bastwick; Prynne was handled barbarously by the executioner. He made, as he returned to his prison, a couple of Latin verses explaining the &#x27;S. L.&#x27; with which he was branded to mean &#x27;stigmata laudis&#x27; (&quot;sign of praise&quot;, or &quot;sign of Laud&quot;).

His imprisonment was then much closer: no pens or ink, nor any books allowed but the Bible, the prayer book, and some orthodox theology. To isolate him from his friends, he was sent first to Carnarvon Castle in July 1637, and then to Mont Orgueil in Jersey. The governor, Philippe de Carteret II treated Prynne well, which he repaid by defending Carteret&#x27;s character in 1645, when he was accused as a malignant and a tyrant. He occupied his imprisonment by writing verse.

==1640s==
He was released by the Long Parliament in 1640. The House of Commons declared the two sentences against him illegal, restored him to his degree and to his membership of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and voted him pecuniary reparation (as late as October 1648 he was still trying to collect it). He supported the Parliamentary cause in the English Civil War, particularly in the press, and in many pamphlets, while still pursuing the bishops.

In 1643 Prynne became involved in the controversy which followed the surrender of Bristol by Nathaniel Fiennes. Together with his ally Clement Walker, he presented articles of accusation against Fiennes to the House of Commons (15 November 1643), managed the case for the prosecution at the court-martial, which took place in the following December, and secured a condemnation of the offending officer. Prynne was also one of the counsel for the parliament at the trial of Lord Maguire in February 1645.

He was able to have the satisfaction of overseeing the trial of William Laud, which was to end in Laud&#x27;s execution. He collected and arranged evidence to prove the charges against him, bore testimony himself in support of many of them, hunted up witnesses against the archbishop, and assisted the counsel for the prosecution in every way. At the time some thought he was clearly tampering with the witnesses. Prynne had the duty of searching Laud&#x27;s room in the Tower for papers. He published a redacted edition of Laud&#x27;s diary and a volume intended to serve as an introduction to his trial. After Laud&#x27;s execution, Prynne was charged by the House of Commons (4 March 1645) to produce an account of the trial; other controversies prevented him from finishing the book.

In the rapidly shifting climate of opinion of the time, Prynne, having been at the forefront of radical opposition, soon found himself a conservative figure, defending Presbyterianism against the Independents favoured by Oliver Cromwell and the army. From 1644 he wrote pamphlets against Independents. He attacked John Goodwin and crossed his old companion in suffering, Henry Burton. He controverted and denounced John Lilburne, and called on Parliament to crush the sectaries. Prynne was equally hostile to the demands of the presbyterian clergy for the establishment of their system: Prynne maintained the supremacy of the state over the church. &#x27;Mr. Prynne and the Erastian lawyers are now our remora,&#x27; complains Robert Baillie in September 1645. He denied in his pamphlets the right of the clergy to excommunicate or to suspend from the reception of the sacrament except on conditions defined by the laws of the state. He was answered by Samuel Rutherford. William M. Lamont writes:

Prynne also came into collision with John Milton, whose doctrine on divorce he had denounced, and was replied to by the poet in a passage in his &quot;Colasterion&quot;. Milton also inserted in the original draft of his sonnet &quot;On the Forcers of Conscience&quot; a reference to &quot;marginal Prynne&#x27;s ears&quot;.

During 1647 the breach between the army and the Parliament turned Prynne&#x27;s attention from theology to politics. He wrote a number of pamphlets against the army, and championed the cause of the eleven presbyterian leaders whom the army impeached. He also undertook official work. From February 1644 he had been a member of the committee of accounts, and on 1 May 1647 he was appointed one of the commissioners for the Visitation of the University of Oxford. In April 1648 Prynne accompanied Philip Herbert, 5th Earl of Pembroke when he came as chancellor of Oxford to expel recalcitrant heads of houses.

In November 1648 Prynne was elected Member of Parliament for Newport in Cornwall for the Long Parliament. As soon as he took his seat, he showed his opposition to the army. He urged the Commons to declare them rebels, and argued that concessions made by Charles in the recent treaty were a satisfactory basis for a peace. Two days later Pride&#x27;s Purge took place. Prynne was arrested by Colonel Thomas Pride and Sir Hardress Waller, and kept prisoner first at an eating-house (called Hell), and then at the Swan and King&#x27;s Head inns in the Strand.

==Pride&#x27;s Purge to the Restoration==
The purged Prynne protested in letters to Lord Fairfax, and by printed declarations on behalf of himself and the other arrested members. He published also a denunciation of the proposed trial of King Charles, being answered by a collection of extracts from his own earlier pamphlets. Released from custody some time in January 1649, Prynne retired to Swainswick, and began a paper war against the new government. He became a thorn in Cromwell&#x27;s side. He wrote three pamphlets against the engagement to be faithful to the Commonwealth, and proved that neither in conscience, law, nor prudence was he bound to pay the taxes which it imposed. The government retaliated by imprisoning him for nearly three years without a trial. On 30 June 1650 he was arrested and confined, first in Dunster Castle and afterwards in Taunton Castle (12 June 1651) and Pendennis Castle (27 June 1651). He was finally offered his liberty on giving security to the amount of £1,000 that he would henceforward do nothing against the government; but, refusing to make any promise, he was released unconditionally on 18 February 1653.

On his release Prynne returned to pamphleteering. He wrote against suspected plots emanating from the Pope and attacked Quakerism, vindicated the rights of patrons against the triers, and discussed the right limits of the Sabbath. The proposal to lift the thirteenth-century ban on the residence of Jews, being promoted then in England by Manasseh ben Israel, among others, inspired him with a pamphlet against the scheme, called in brief the &quot;Short Demurrer&quot;. The pamphlet was printed shortly before the Whitehall Conference, and was influential in strengthening opinion against the readmission of the Jews. In particular, Prynne doubts the probability that the Jews would be converted to Christianity once in England. Oliver Cromwell allowed the Jews to return to the British Isles on the condition that the Jews attend compulsory Christian sermons on a Sunday, to encourage their conversion to Christianity. Cromwell based this decision on St. Paul&#x27;s epistle to the Romans 10:15. The offer of the crown to Cromwell by the &quot;petition and advice&quot; suggested a parallel between Cromwell and Richard III. Similarly, when the Protector, as Cromwell then was styled, set up a House of Lords, Prynne expanded the tract in defence of their rights which he had published in 1648 into an historical treatise of five hundred pages. These writings, however, attracted little attention.

After the fall of Richard Cromwell he regained the popular ear. As soon as the Long Parliament was re-established, Prynne got together a few of the members excluded by Pride&#x27;s purge and endeavoured to take his place in the house. On 7 May 1659 he was kept back by the guards, but on 9 May he managed to get in, and kept his seat there for a whole sitting. Arthur Haslerig and Sir Henry Vane threatened him, but Prynne told them he had as good right there as either, and had suffered more for the rights of parliament than any of them. They could only get rid of him by adjourning the house, and forcibly keeping him out when it reassembled. On 27 December when the parliament was again restored after its interruption by John Lambert, Prynne and his friends made a fresh attempt to enter, but were once more excluded. From May 1659 to February 1660 he went on publishing tracts on the case of the &quot;secluded members and attacks on the ref-formed Rump Parliament and the army&quot;. Marchamont Nedham, Henry Stubbe, John Rogers, and others printed serious answers to his arguments, while obscure libellers ridiculed him.

On 21 February 1660 George Monck ordered the guards of the house to readmit the secluded members. Prynne, girt with an old basket-hilted sword, marched into Westminster Hall at their head; though the effect was spoiled when Sir William Waller tripped on the sword. The house charged him to bring in a bill for the dissolution of the Long Parliament. In the debate on the bill Prynne asserted the rights of Charles II of England and claimed that the writs should be issued in his name. He also helped to forward the Restoration by accelerating the passing of the Militia Bill, which placed the control of the forces in the hands of the king&#x27;s friends. A letter which he addressed to Charles II shows that he was personally thanked by the king for his services.

==From 1660==
Prynne supported the Restoration, and was rewarded with public office. In April 1660 he was elected MP for Bath in the Convention Parliament. He was bitter against the regicides and the supporters of the previous government, trying to restrict the scope of the Act of Indemnity. He successfully moved to have Charles Fleetwood excepted, and urged the exclusion of Richard Cromwell and Judge Francis Thorpe. He proposed punitive and financial measures of broad scope, was zealous for the disbanding of the army, and was one of the commissioners appointed to pay it off. In the debates on religion he was one of the leaders of the presbyterians, spoke against the Thirty-nine Articles, denied the claims of the bishops, urged the validity of presbyterian ordination, and supported the bill for turning the king&#x27;s ecclesiastical declaration into law.

As a politician Prynne was during his latter years of minor importance. He was re-elected MP for Bath to the Cavalier Parliament of May 1661. He asserted his presbyterianism by refusing to kneel when the two houses received the sacrament together. A few weeks earlier he had published a pamphlet demanding the revision of the prayer-book, but the new parliament was opposed to any concessions to nonconformity. On 15 July a pamphlet by Prynne against the Corporation Bill was voted scandalous and seditious. In January 1667 Prynne was one of the managers of Lord Mordaunt&#x27;s impeachment. He spoke several times on Clarendon&#x27;s impeachment, and opposed the bill for his banishment. On constitutional subjects and points of procedure his opinion had weight, and in 1667 he was privately consulted by the king on the question whether a parliament which had been prorogued could be convened before the day fixed for its resumption.

He became the Keeper of Records in the Tower of London; as a writer his most lasting works belong to that period, for the amount of historical material they contain. During this time, he expanded upon &quot;An Exact Abridgement of the Records in the Tower of London&quot;, published by the Cotton library under the stewardship of Sir Thomas Cotton. The text contained comprehensive records of parliaments held between the reigns of Edward II and Richard III of England, and was considered a tribute to Prynne&#x27;s fascination toward parliament&#x27;s relationship with the English monarchy. The book was printed by renowned London publisher William Leake.

&quot;Histriomastix&quot; is the one of his works that receives attention from modern scholars, but for its relevance to English Renaissance theatre. Anthony à Wood found him affable, obliging towards researchers, and courteous in the fashion of the early part of the century. Prynne died unmarried on 24 October 1669. He was buried in the undercroft of the chapel of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

<text>Alfred Thayer Mahan (; September 27, 1840 – December 1, 1914) was a United States naval officer and historian, whom John Keegan called &quot;the most important American strategist of the nineteenth century.&quot; His 1890 book &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783&quot; won immediate recognition, especially in Europe, and with the publication of its 1892 successor, &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon the French Revolution and Empire, 1793–1812&quot;, he affirmed his status as a globally-known and regarded military strategist, historian, and theorist. Mahan&#x27;s works encouraged the development of large capital ships — eventually leading to dreadnought battleships — as he was an advocate of the &#x27;decisive battle&#x27; and of naval blockades. Critics, however, charged him with failing to adequately explain the rise of largely land-based empires, such as the German or Ottoman Empires, though Mahan did accurately predict both empires&#x27; defeats in World War I. Mahan directly influenced the dominant interwar period and World War II-era Japanese naval doctrine of the , and he became a &quot;household name&quot; in Germany. He also promoted American control over Hawaii though he was &quot;lukewarm&quot; in regards to American imperialism in general. Four U.S. Navy ships have borne his name, as well as various buildings and roads; and his works are still read, discussed, and debated in military, historical, and scholarly circles.

==Early life==
Mahan was born on September 27, 1840, at West Point, New York, to Dennis Hart Mahan, a professor at the United States Military Academy and the foremost American expert on fortifications, and Mary Helena Okill Mahan (1815–1893), daughter of John Okill and Mary Jay, daughter of Sir James Jay. Mahan&#x27;s middle name honors &quot;the father of West Point&quot;, Sylvanus Thayer. Mahan attended Saint James School, an Episcopal college preparatory academy in western Maryland. He then studied at Columbia for two years, where he was a member of the Philolexian Society debating club. Against the wishes of his father, Mahan then entered the U.S. Naval Academy, where he graduated second in his class in 1859.

==Early career==
After graduation he was assigned to the frigate from 9 June 1859 until 1861. He then joined the steam-corvette of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and participated in the Battle of Port Royal in South Carolina early in the American Civil War. Commissioned as a lieutenant in 1861, Mahan served as an officer on and and as an instructor at the Naval Academy. In 1865, he was promoted to lieutenant commander, and then to commander (1872), and captain (1885). As commander of the he was stationed at Callao, Peru, protecting U.S. interests during the final stages of the War of the Pacific.

While in actual command of a ship, his skills were not exemplary; and a number of vessels under his command were involved in collisions with both moving and stationary objects. He preferred old square-rigged vessels rather than smoky, noisy steamships of his own day; and he tried to avoid active sea duty.

==Naval War College and writings==
In 1885, he was appointed as a lecturer in naval history and tactics at the Naval War College. Before entering on his duties, College President Rear Admiral Stephen B. Luce pointed Mahan in the direction of writing his future studies on the influence of sea power. During his first year on the faculty, he remained at his home in New York City researching and writing his lectures. Though he was prepared to become a professor in 1886, Luce was given command of the North Atlantic Squadron, and Mahan became President of the Naval War College by default (June 22, 1886 – January 12, 1889, July 22, 1892 – May 10, 1893). There, in 1888, he met and befriended future president Theodore Roosevelt, then a visiting lecturer.

Mahan&#x27;s lectures, based on secondary sources and the military theories of Antoine-Henri Jomini, became his sea-power studies: &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783&quot; (1890); &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon the French Revolution and Empire, 1793–1812&quot; (2 vols., 1892); &quot;Sea Power in Relation to the War of 1812&quot; (2 vols., 1905), and &quot;The Life of Nelson: The Embodiment of the Sea Power of Great Britain&quot; (2 vols., 1897). Mahan stressed the importance of the individual in shaping history and extolled the traditional values of loyalty, courage, and service to the state. Mahan sought to resurrect Horatio Nelson as a national hero in Britain and used his biography as a platform for expressing his views on naval strategy and tactics. Mahan was criticized for so strongly condemning Nelson&#x27;s love affair with Lady Emma Hamilton, but it remained the standard biography until the appearance of Carola Oman&#x27;s &quot;Nelson&quot;, 50 years later.

Mahan struck up a friendship with pioneering British naval historian Sir John Knox Laughton, the pair maintaining the relationship through correspondence and visits when Mahan was in London. Mahan was later described as a &quot;disciple&quot; of Laughton, but the two were at pains to distinguish between each other&#x27;s line of work. Laughton saw Mahan as a theorist while Mahan called Laughton &quot;the historian&quot;. Mahan worked closely with William McCarty Little, another critical figure in the early history of the Naval War College. A principal developer of wargaming in the United States Navy, Mahan credited Little for assisting him with preparing maps and charts for his lectures and first book.

==Origin and limitation of strategic views==
Mahan&#x27;s views were shaped by 17th-century conflicts between the Dutch Republic, the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of France, and Habsburg Spain, and by the naval conflicts between France and Spain during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. British naval superiority eventually defeated France, consistently preventing invasion and an effective blockade. Mahan emphasized that naval operations were chiefly to be won by decisive battles and blockades. In the 19th century, the United States sought greater control over its seaborne commerce in order to protect its economic interests which relied heavily on exports bound mainly for Europe.

According to Peter Paret&#x27;s &quot;Makers of Modern Strategy from Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age&quot;, Mahan&#x27;s emphasis on sea power as the most important cause of Britain&#x27;s rise to world power neglected diplomacy and land arms. Furthermore, theories of sea power do not explain the rise of land empires, such as Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s German Empire or the Russian Empire.

==Sea power==
Mahan believed that national greatness was inextricably associated with the sea, with its commercial use in peace and its control in war; and he used history as a stock of examples to exemplify his theories, arguing that the education of naval officers should be based on a rigorous study of history. Mahan&#x27;s framework derived from Jomini, and emphasized strategic locations (such as choke points, canals, and coaling stations), as well as quantifiable levels of fighting power in a fleet. Mahan also believed that in peacetime, states should increase production and shipping capacities and acquire overseas possessions, though he stressed that the number of coal fueling stations and strategic bases should be limited to avoid draining too many resources from the mother country.

The primary mission of a navy was to secure the command of the sea, which would permit the maintenance of sea communications for one&#x27;s own ships while denying their use to the enemy and, if necessary, closely supervise neutral trade. Control of the sea could be achieved not by destruction of commerce but only by destroying or neutralizing the enemy fleet. Such a strategy called for the concentration of naval forces composed of capital ships, not too large but numerous, well-manned with crews thoroughly trained, and operating under the principle that the best defense is an aggressive offense.

Mahan contended that with a command of the sea, even if local and temporary, naval operations in support of land forces could be of decisive importance. He also believed that naval supremacy could be exercised by a transnational consortium acting in defense of a multinational system of free trade. His theories, expounded before the submarine became a serious factor in warfare, delayed the introduction of convoys as a defense against the Imperial German Navy&#x27;s U-boat campaign during World War I. By the 1930s, the U.S. Navy had built long-range submarines to raid Japanese shipping; but in World War II, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, still tied to Mahan, designed its submarines as ancillaries to the fleet and failed to attack American supply lines in the Pacific. Mahan&#x27;s analysis of the Spanish-American War suggested to him that the great distances in the Pacific required the American battle fleet to be designed with long-range striking power.

Mahan believed first, that good political and naval leadership was no less important than geography when it came to the development of sea power. Second, Mahan&#x27;s unit of political analysis insofar as sea power was concerned was a transnational consortium, rather than a single nation state. Third, his economic ideal was free trade rather than autarky. Fourth, his recognition of the influence of geography on strategy was tempered by a strong appreciation of the power of contingency to affect outcomes.

In 1890, Mahan prepared a secret contingency plan for war between the British Empire and the United States. Mahan believed that if the Royal Navy blockaded the East Coast of the United States, the US Navy should be concentrated in one of its ports, preferably New York Harbor with its two widely separated exits, and employ torpedo boats to defend the other harbors. This concentration of the U.S. fleet would force the British to tie down such a large proportion of their navy to watch the New York exits that other American ports would be relatively safe. Detached American cruisers should wage &quot;constant offensive action&quot; against the enemy&#x27;s exposed positions; and if the British were to weaken their blockade force off New York to attack another American port, the concentrated U.S. fleet could capture British coaling ports in Nova Scotia, thereby seriously weakening British ability to engage in naval operations off the American coast. This contingency plan was a clear example of Mahan&#x27;s application of his principles of naval war, with a clear reliance on Jomini&#x27;s principle of controlling strategic points.

==Impact==
Timeliness contributed no small part to the widespread acceptance of Mahan&#x27;s theories. Although his history was relatively thin, based as it was on secondary sources, his vigorous style, and clear theory won widespread acceptance of navalists and supporters of the New Imperialism in Africa and Asia.

Given the rapid technological changes underway in propulsion (from coal to oil and from reciprocating engines to turbines), ordnance (with better fire directors, and new high explosives), and armor and the emergence of new craft such as destroyers and submarines, Mahan&#x27;s emphasis on the capital ship and the command of the sea came at an opportune moment.

===Germany===
Mahan&#x27;s name became a household word in the Imperial German Navy after Kaiser Wilhelm II ordered his officers to read Mahan, and Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz (1849–1930) used Mahan&#x27;s reputation to finance a powerful High Seas Fleet. Tirpitz, an intense navalist who believed ardently in Mahan&#x27;s dictum that whatever power rules the sea also ruled the world, had &quot;The Influence of Sea Power Upon History&quot; translated into German in 1898 and had 8,000 copies distributed for free as a way of pressuring the &quot;Reichstag&quot; to vote for the First Navy Bill.

Tirpitz used Mahan not only as a way of winning over German public opinion but also as a guide to strategic thinking. Before 1914, Tirpitz completely rejected commerce raiding as a strategy and instead embraced Mahan&#x27;s ideal of a decisive battle of annihilation between two fleets as the way to win command of the seas. Tirpitz always planned for the German High Seas Fleet to win the &quot;Entscheidungsschlacht&quot; (decisive battle) against the British Grand Fleet somewhere in &quot;the waters between Helgoland and the Thames&quot;, a strategy he based on his reading of &quot;The Influence of Sea Power Upon History&quot;.

However, the naval warfare of World War I proved completely different than German planners, influenced by Mahan, had anticipated because the Royal Navy avoided open battle and focused on blockading Germany. As a result, after the Battles of Heligoland Bight and Dogger Bank, Admiral Hugo von Pohl kept most of Germany&#x27;s surface fleet at its North Sea bases. In 1916, his successor, Reinhard Scheer, tried to lure the Grand Fleet into a Mahanian decisive battle at the Battle of Jutland, but the engagement ended in a strategic defeat. Finally as the German army neared defeat in the Hundred Days Offensive, the German Navy&#x27;s high command, without informing the government, tried to mobilize the fleet for a decisive engagement with the Royal Navy. The sailors rebelled in the Kiel mutiny, instigating the German Revolution of 1918–1919 which toppled the Hohenzollern monarchy.

===United Kingdom===
Mahan and British First Sea Lord John Fisher (1841–1920) both addressed the problem of how to dominate home waters and distant seas with naval forces unable to do both. Mahan argued for a universal principle of concentration of powerful ships in home waters with minimized strength in distant seas. Fisher instead decided to use submarines to defend home waters and mobile battlecruisers to protect British interests.

===France===
Though in 1914, French naval doctrine was dominated by Mahan&#x27;s theory of sea power, the course of World War I changed ideas about the place of the navy. The refusal of the German fleet to engage in a decisive battle, the Dardanelles expedition of 1915, the development of submarine warfare, and the organization of convoys all showed the French Navy&#x27;s new role in combined operations with the French Army. The Navy&#x27;s part in securing victory was not fully understood by French public opinion in 1918, but a synthesis of old and new ideas arose from the lessons of the war, especially by Admiral Raoul Castex (1878–1968), who synthesized in his five-volume &quot;Théories Stratégiques&quot; the classical and materialist schools of naval theory. He reversed Mahan&#x27;s theory that command of the sea precedes maritime communications and foresaw the enlarged roles of aircraft and submarines in naval warfare.

===Japan===
&quot;The Influence of Seapower Upon History, 1660–1783&quot; was translated into Japanese and was used as a textbook in the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). That usage strongly affected the IJN&#x27;s plan to end Russian naval expansion in the Far East, which culminated in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. It has been argued that the IJN&#x27;s pursuit of the &quot;decisive battle&quot; (Kantai Kessen) contributed to Imperial Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II, because the development of the submarine and the aircraft carrier, combined with advances in technology, largely rendered obsolete the doctrine of the decisive battle between fleets. Nevertheless, the IJN did not adhere strictly to Mahanian doctrine because its forces were often tactically divided, particularly during the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Midway.

===United States===
Mahan believed that if the United States were to build an Isthmian canal, it would become a Pacific power, and therefore it should take possession of Hawaii to protect the West Coast. Nevertheless, his support for American imperialism was more ambivalent than is often stated, and he remained lukewarm about American annexation of the Philippines. Mahan was a major influence on the Roosevelt family. In addition to Theodore, he corresponded with Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt until his death in 1914. During World War II, Roosevelt would ignore the late Mahan&#x27;s prior advice to him that the Commonwealth of the Philippines could not be defended against an Imperial Japanese invasion, leading to a futile defense of the islands against the Japanese Philippines campaign.

==Later career==
Between 1889 and 1892, Mahan was engaged in special service for the Bureau of Navigation, and in 1893 he was appointed to command the powerful new protected cruiser on a visit to Europe, where he was feted. He returned to lecture at the War College and then, in 1896, he retired from active service, returning briefly to duty in 1898 to consult on naval strategy during the Spanish–American War.

Mahan continued to write, and he received honorary degrees from Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Dartmouth, and McGill. In 1902, Mahan popularized the term &quot;Middle East,&quot; which he used in the article &quot;The Persian Gulf and International Relations,&quot; published in September in the &quot;National Review&quot;.

As a delegate to the 1899 Hague Convention, Mahan argued against prohibiting the use of asphyxiating gases in warfare on the ground that such weapons would inflict such terrible casualties that belligerents would be forced to end wars more quickly, thus providing a net advantage for world peace.

In 1902, Mahan was elected president of the American Historical Association, and his address, &quot;Subordination in Historical Treatment&quot;, is his most explicit explanation of his philosophy of history.

In 1906, Mahan became rear admiral by an Act of Congress that promoted all retired captains who had served in the American Civil War. At the outbreak of World War I, he published statements favorable to the cause of the Allies, but in an attempt to enforce American neutrality, President Woodrow Wilson ordered that all active and retired officers refrain from publicly commenting on the war.

==Religious life==
Mahan was reared as an Episcopalian and became a devout churchman with High Church sympathies. For instance, late in life he strongly opposed revision of the Book of Common Prayer. Nevertheless, Mahan also appears to have undergone a conversion experience about 1871, when he realized that he could experience God&#x27;s favor, not through his own merits, but only through &quot;trust in the completed work of Christ on the cross.&quot; Geissler called one of his religious addresses almost &quot;evangelical, albeit of the dignified stiff-upper-lip variety.&quot; And Mahan never mentioned a conversion experience in his autobiography.

In later life, Mahan often spoke to Episcopal parishes. In 1899, at Holy Trinity Church in Brooklyn, Mahan emphasized his own religious experience and declared that one needed a personal relationship with God given through the work of the Holy Spirit. In 1909, Mahan published &quot;The Harvest Within: Thoughts on the Life of the Christian&quot;, which was &quot;part personal testimony, part biblical analysis, part expository sermon.&quot;

==Death and commemoration==

Mahan died in Washington, D.C., of heart failure on December 1, 1914, a few months after the outbreak of World War I.

==Family==
Alfred Thayer Mahan married Ellen Lyle Evans (born November 27, 1851) in June 1872. Together, they had two daughters and one son; Helen Evans Mahan, born August 6, 1873; Ellen Kuhn Mahan, born July 10, 1877; and Lyle Evans Mahan, born 12 February 1881. Lyle Mahan alleged that his mother and father inherited several modest fortunes, though he admits that between maintaining multiple households (the Mahans owned at least two homes for most of their lives) and funding his sisters&#x27; and his own educations, they were not immensely wealthy. Lyle would go on to be a successful attorney and financier, and named his only son Alfred
Thayer Mahan II (born 1905, died 1985).

==In fiction==
In &quot;1901&quot;, an alternate history by Robert Conroy, the main character is a young United States Army officer named Patrick Mahan, a fictitious nephew of Admiral Mahan, who himself appears briefly in the story as well.

In Harry Turtledove&#x27;s &quot;Southern Victory&quot;, another alternate history, Mahan is frequently mentioned but never appears. He is spoken of as having been President of the United States from 1889 to 1897, and the Mahan Bedroom is a famous room in the Powel House in Philadelphia, analogous to the actual Lincoln Bedroom in the White House. As President, Mahan prevented the construction of a Confederate shipping canal in Nicaragua and opined that the main problem with republics is that &quot;over time, the voters are apt to get tired of paying for what their country needs to defend itself&quot;.

The protagonist in G.C. Edmondson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Ship that Sailed the Time Stream&quot; frequently mentions Mahan and/or Mahan&#x27;s ghost as an exclamation.

In &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot;, Erskine Childers has his character Davies &quot;aimlessly fingering a volume of Mahan&quot;.

<doc id="210137" wikidata="Q131478" url="?curid=210137" title="Der Spiegel">
<text> (, , stylized in all caps) is a German weekly news magazine published in Hamburg. With a weekly circulation of about 724,000 copies in 2022, it is one of the largest such publications in Europe. It was founded in 1947 by John Seymour Chaloner, a British army officer, and Rudolf Augstein, a former &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; radio operator who was recognized in 2000 by the International Press Institute as one of the fifty World Press Freedom Heroes.

 is known in German-speaking countries mostly for its investigative journalism. It has played a key role in uncovering many political scandals such as the &quot;Spiegel&quot; affair in 1962 and the Flick affair in the 1980s. The news website by the same name was launched in 1994 under the name &quot;Spiegel Online&quot; with an independent editorial staff. Today, the content is created by a shared editorial team and the website uses the same media brand as the printed magazine.

==History==

The first edition of was published in Hanover on Saturday, 4 January 1947. Its release was initiated and sponsored by the British occupational administration and preceded by a magazine titled &quot;Diese Woche&quot; (German: &quot;This Week&quot;), which had first been published in November 1946. After disagreements with the British, the magazine was handed over to Rudolf Augstein as chief editor, and was renamed . From the first edition in January 1947, Augstein held the position of editor-in-chief, which he retained until his death on 7 November 2002.

After 1950, the magazine was owned by Rudolf Augstein and John Jahr; Jahr&#x27;s share merged with Richard Gruner&#x27;s in 1965 to form the publishing company Gruner + Jahr. In 1969, Augstein bought out Gruner + Jahr for DM 42 million and became the sole owner of . In 1971, Gruner + Jahr bought back a 25% share in the magazine. In 1974, Augstein restructured the company to make the employees shareholders. All employees with more than three years seniority were offered the opportunity to become an associate and participate in the management of the company, as well as in the profits. Since 1952, has been headquartered in its own building in the old town part of Hamburg.

 circulation rose quickly. From 15,000 copies in 1947, it grew to 65,000 in 1948 and 437,000 in 1961. It was nearly 500,000 copies in 1962. By the 1970s, it had reached a plateau at about 900,000 copies. When the German reunification in 1990 made it available to a new readership in former East Germany, the circulation exceeded one million.

The magazine&#x27;s influence is based on two pillars; firstly the moral authority established by investigative journalism since the early years and proven alive by several scoops during the 1980s; secondly the economic power of the prolific &quot;Spiegel&quot; publishing house. Since 1988, it has produced the TV program &quot;Spiegel TV&quot;, and further diversified during the 1990s.

During the second quarter of 1992 the circulation of was 1.1 million copies. In 1994, &quot;Spiegel Online&quot; was launched. It had separate and independent editorial staff from . In 1999, the circulation of was 1,061,000 copies.
 had an average circulation of 1,076,000 copies in 2003. In 2007 the magazine started a new regional supplement in Switzerland. A 50-page study of Switzerland, it was the first regional supplement of the magazine.

In 2010 was employing the equivalent of 80 full-time fact checkers, which the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; called &quot;most likely the world&#x27;s largest fact checking operation&quot;. The same year it was the third best-selling general interest magazine in Europe with a circulation of 1,016,373 copies.

In 2018, became involved in a journalistic scandal after it discovered and made public that one of its leading reporters, Claas Relotius, had &quot;falsified his articles on a grand scale&quot;. 

==Reception==
When Stefan Aust took over in 1994, the magazine&#x27;s readers realized that his personality was different from his predecessor. In 2005, a documentary by Stephan Lamby quoted him as follows: &quot;We stand at a very big cannon!&quot; Politicians of all stripes who had to deal with the magazine&#x27;s attention often voiced their disaffection for it. The outspoken conservative Franz Josef Strauss contended that was &quot;the Gestapo of our time&quot;. He referred to journalists in general as &quot;rats&quot;. The Social Democrat Willy Brandt called it &quot;Scheißblatt&quot; (i.e., a &quot;shit paper&quot;) during his term in office as Chancellor.

 often produces feature-length articles on problems affecting Germany (like demographic trends, the federal system&#x27;s gridlock or the issues of its education system) and describes optional strategies and their risks in depth. The magazine plays the role of opinion leader in the German press. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, is one of continental Europe&#x27;s most influential magazines.

==Investigative journalism==
 has a distinctive reputation for revealing political misconduct and scandals. Online Encyclopædia Britannica emphasizes this quality of the magazine as follows: &quot;The magazine is renowned for its aggressive, vigorous, and well-written exposés of government malpractice and scandals.&quot; It merited recognition for this as early as 1950 when the federal parliament launched an inquiry into &quot;Spiegel&quot;s accusations that bribed members of parliament had promoted Bonn over Frankfurt as the seat of West Germany&#x27;s government.

During the Spiegel scandal in 1962, which followed the release of a report about the possible low state of readiness of the German armed forces, minister of defense and conservative figurehead Franz Josef Strauss had investigated. In the course of this investigation, the editorial offices were raided by police while Rudolf Augstein and other editors were arrested on charges of treason. Despite a lack of sufficient authority, Strauss even went after the article&#x27;s author, , who was consequently arrested in Spain where he was on holiday. When the legal case collapsed, the scandal led to a major shake-up in chancellor Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s cabinet, and Strauss had to stand down. The affair was generally received as an attack on the freedom of the press. Since then, has repeatedly played a significant role in revealing political grievances and misdeeds, including the Flick Affair.

In 2010, the magazine supported WikiLeaks in publishing leaked materials from the United States State Department, along with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, , and &quot;Le Monde&quot; and in October 2013 with the help of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden unveiled the systematic wiretapping of Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel&#x27;s private cell phone over a period of over 10 years at the hands of the National Security Agency&#x27;s Special Collection Service (SCS).

According to a 2013 report by The New York Times, the magazine&#x27;s leading role in German investigative journalism has diminished, since other German media outlets, including &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;, &quot;Bild&quot;, ARD and ZDF, have become more involved in investigative reporting.

In November 2023, Der Spiegel joined with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and 69 media partners including Distributed Denial of Secrets and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and more than 270 journalists in 55 countries and territories to produce the &#x27;Cyprus Confidential&#x27; report on the financial network which supports the regime of Vladimir Putin, mostly with connections to Cyprus, and showed Cyprus to have strong links with high-up figures in the Kremlin, some of whom have been sanctioned. Government officials including Cyprus president Nikos Christodoulides and European lawmakers began responding to the investigation&#x27;s findings in less than 24 hours, calling for reforms and launching probes.

==Fake news scandals==

 has reportedly been involved in controversies over publishing fake news.

===2018 fabrication scandal===
On 19 December 2018, made public that reporter Claas Relotius had admitted that he had &quot;falsified his articles on a grand scale&quot;, inventing facts, persons and quotations in at least 14 of his stories. The magazine uncovered the fraud after a co-author of one of Relotius&#x27;s stories, Juan Moreno, became suspicious of the veracity of Relotius&#x27;s contributions and gathered evidence against him. Relotius resigned, telling the magazine that he was &quot;sick&quot; and needed to get help. left his articles accessible, but with a notice referring to the magazine&#x27;s ongoing investigation into the fabrications.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; cited a former journalist who said &quot;some of the articles at issue appeared to confirm certain German stereotypes about Trump voters, asking &quot;was this possible because of ideological bias?&quot; An apology ensued from for looking for a cliché of a Trump-voting town, and not finding it. Mathias Bröckers, former &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; editor, wrote: &quot;the imaginative author simply delivered what his superiors demanded and fit into their spin&quot;. American journalist James Kirchick claimed in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that &quot; has long peddled crude and sensational anti-Americanism.&quot; The US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell also wrote a letter to the magazine&#x27;s editors, saying that Claas Relotius&#x27;s journalism showed an anti-American bias. He also expressed shock at how Der Spiegel allowed &quot;anti-American coverage.&quot;

===2022 fake news about refugee death at the Greece–Turkey borders===
In the summer of 2022, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; published three articles and a podcast regarding the death of a refugee girl named &quot;Maria&quot; on an islet in the Evros river at the Greece–Turkey borders, accusing Greece of failing to aid the refugees which caused the girl&#x27;s death. But at the end of December 2022, the magazine retracted the articles and the podcast. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reported that the story had been fabricated. In 2023, the Swiss newspaper &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot; (NZZ) wrote that this story was &quot;one of the largest fake news breakdowns since Claas Relotius.&quot;

=== People&#x27;s Mojahedin Organization of Iran ===
The Hamburg state court ordered Der Spiegel in 2019 to remove unsupported claims from an article that accused the  People&#x27;s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK) of &quot;torture&quot; and &quot;psychoterror.&quot;

<doc id="210142" wikidata="Q223183" url="?curid=210142" title="Peter II of Yugoslavia">
<text>Peter II Karađorđević (; 6 September 1923 – 3 November 1970) was the last King of Yugoslavia, reigning from October 1934 until he was deposed in November 1945. He was the last reigning member of the Karađorđević dynasty.

The eldest child of King Alexander I and Maria of Romania, Peter acceded to the Yugoslav throne in 1934 at the age of 11 after his father was assassinated during a state visit to France. A regency was set up under his cousin Prince Paul. After Paul declared Yugoslavia&#x27;s accession to the Tripartite Pact in late March 1941, a pro-British coup d&#x27;état deposed the regent and declared Peter of age.

In response, Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia ten days later and quickly overran the country, forcing the king and his ministers into exile. A government-in-exile was set up in June 1941 following Peter&#x27;s arrival at London. In March 1944, he married Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark. Their only son, Alexander, was born a year later. In November 1945, the Yugoslav Constituent Assembly formally deposed Peter and proclaimed Yugoslavia a republic.

Peter settled in the United States after his deposition. Suffering from depression and alcoholism later in his life, he died of cirrhosis in November 1970 at the age of 47. His remains were buried at the Saint Sava Monastery Church in Libertyville, Illinois, before being transferred to the Royal Mausoleum of Oplenac in 2013.

==Early life==

Peter II was born on 6 September 1923 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. He was the eldest son of Alexander I of Yugoslavia and Maria of Romania. His godparents were his maternal aunt Queen Elizabeth of Greece, his maternal grandfather King Ferdinand I of Romania and King George V of the United Kingdom, for whom his son, the Duke of York, stood proxy.

Prince Peter was initially tutored at the Royal Palace, Belgrade, before attending Sandroyd School then in Cobham, Surrey where Reed&#x27;s School now stands. When he was 11 years old, Prince Peter succeeded to the Yugoslav throne on 9 October 1934 upon his father&#x27;s assassination in Marseille during a state visit to France. In view of the new monarch&#x27;s youth, a regency was set up under his father&#x27;s cousin Prince Paul.

Prince Regent Paul took the view that he must not change the kingdom from the way that King Alexander had left it so that his son could take possession of it unaltered when he turned 18 in September 1941, and resisted any attempts to revise the 1931 constitution. On 20 August 1939, Paul permitted the prime minister, Dragiša Cvetković, to sign an agreement with Vladko Maček, the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, which created a new Banovina of Croatia with substantial autonomy and a much greater size, covering much of what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina, and satisfying at least in part the long-standing demands of the Croats.

The agreement was very unpopular with the Serbs, especially when reports emerged that the &quot;prečani&quot; Serbs were being discriminated against by the authorities of the autonomous &quot;banovina&quot;. The tense international situation of August 1939 with the Danzig crisis pushing Europe to the brink of war meant Paul wanted to settle one of the more debilitating internal disputes in order to make Yugoslavia more capable of surviving the coming storm.

The agreement came at the cost of both Paul and Cvetković being condemned by Serbian public opinion for &quot;selling out&quot; to the Croats, all the more so as many Croats made it clear that they saw the &quot;banovina&quot; of Croatia as only a stepping stone towards independence. The unpopularity of the agreement and the Cvetković government, was one of the reasons for the coup d&#x27;état of 27 March 1941 as many Serbs believed that Peter, the son of King Alexander, would continue with his father&#x27;s centralising policies when he reached his majority.

==Second World War==

Prince Regent Paul declared that the Kingdom of Yugoslavia would join the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. Two days later, King Peter, at age 17, was proclaimed of age after a pro-British coup d&#x27;état. The initially bloodless coup was led by General Dušan Simović on 27 March 1941 in the name of Peter. As General Simović led his men toward the Royal Compound, which was surrounded by guards loyal to the Regent, Peter climbed down a drain-pipe to greet the rebels.

As the Regent&#x27;s guards surrendered without fighting, Simović arrived to tell Peter: &quot;Your Majesty, I salute you as King of Yugoslavia. From this moment you will exercise your full sovereign power&quot;. The coup was very popular in Belgrade and Peter was well received by the crowds. The people who had come out in Belgrade to show their support for the coup had a very pro-Allied character, many of the protesters waving British and French flags. The crowds in Belgrade cheered Peter wildly as the 17-year-old king drove his car down the streets without his bodyguards to be greeted by his subjects.

The new government that Peter swore in on 27 March 1941 was headed by General Simović and comprised members of the People&#x27;s Radical Party, the Croatian Peasant Party, the Democratic Party, the Croatian Independent Democrats, the Slovene People&#x27;s Party, the Yugoslav Muslim Organization, the Agrarian Party and the Yugoslav National Party. With the exception of the Yugoslav Radical Alliance and the banned Yugoslav Communist Party and the &quot;Ustashe&quot;, all of the main political parties were represented in the new government.

Postponing Operation Barbarossa, Nazi Germany simultaneously attacked Yugoslavia and Greece on 6 April 1941, Orthodox Easter Sunday. The Luftwaffe bombed Belgrade, killing between 3,000 and 4,000 people. Within a week, Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary and Italy invaded Yugoslavia, and the government was forced to surrender on 17 April. Parts of Yugoslavia were annexed by Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary and Germany. The remaining parts were governed by two German-controlled puppet governments, the Independent State of Croatia and the Serbian Government of National Salvation. 

Peter left the country with the Royal Yugoslav Government&#x27;s ministers following the Axis invasion. Initially the Yugoslav king and his government ministers went to Greece where they refuelled at a British airfield in rural Greece where locals did not at first believe that he was king of Yugoslavia. They then went to British-ruled Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine, and Cairo in Egypt. In Athens on 16 April 1941, Peter issued a press statement saying he would fight until victory before fleeing Greece.

In Jerusalem on 4 May 1941, Peter affirmed in a press statement the Cvetković–Maček agreement of 23 August 1939, which turned Yugoslavia into a semi-federation as the basis of the post-war political system he was planning to introduce once his nation was liberated. Of the 22 men Peter had sworn in as ministers on 27 March 1941, two were killed during the German invasion and another five chose not to go into exile.

Džafer Kulenović of the Yugoslav Muslim Organization switched sides and went over to the &quot;Ustashe&quot;, urging Bosnian Muslims to join the Croats in killing Serbs; Father Franc Kulovec of the Slovene People&#x27;s Party was killed during the bombing of Belgrade; and Vladko Maček of the Croatian Peasant Party decided not to go into exile. As a result, the Yugoslav government-in-exile was dominated by Serb ministers.

The constitutional basis of the government-in-exile was always murky, as the government had come into power as a result of a coup d&#x27;état. Regardless, it professed to be based on the 1931 constitution, which made the king the chief executive officer of the state and ministers only responsible to the Crown. The politicians took the view that the 1941 coup d&#x27;état had been a popular revolution which had restored democracy, but as long as the 1931 constitution was technically still in effect, King Peter had very broad executive powers.

=== Government-in-exile ===

In June 1941, King Peter arrived in London, where he joined other governments in exile from Nazi-occupied Europe. When Peter and his government landed in London they were greeted as heroes by the British media. The British press presented what the Serbian historian Stevan K. Pavlowitch called a &quot;romanticized&quot; picture of the young Peter, who became a &quot;symbol of his country&#x27;s struggle to keep its freedom in alliance with Great Britain&quot;. He was supplied with a Lendrum &amp; Hartman Limited Buick delivered to his exile home near Cambridge. 

A sign of the initial high regard for Peter in the neutral United States, he was featured as a hero in October 1941 edition of the comic book &quot;Military Comics: Stories of the Army and Navy&quot;, which presented a somewhat fictionalized version of the 27 March 1941 coup d&#x27;état in Belgrade in which a group of secondary school students who are upset by Yugoslavia&#x27;s signing of the Tripartite Pact rally for the king and overthrow the regent.
Peter quickly learned that the degree of attention the British were willing to give to the governments-in-exile was directly related to what assets the government-in-exile could bring to the Allied cause. As only a few hundred Yugoslav soldiers had escaped to Egypt, the Yugoslav government-in-exile did not have much to contribute.

Initially, the government-in-exile planned to make good its losses by recruiting an army from Yugoslav immigrants in the neutral United States, but the American government objected to this plan, and instead the government-in-exile had to recruit from the ethnic Slovene POWs captured while fighting with the Royal Italian Army. From the British POW camps, enough ethnic Slovenes volunteered to provide one infantry battalion, who were reluctant to fight against the Italians as they would be executed for treason if captured. In terms of military forces available in the Middle East, Yugoslavia was as Pavlowitch put it the &quot;least important of the allies&quot;. The Yugoslav officer corps in Egypt was prone to feuding between younger officers who blamed the senior officers for Yugoslavia&#x27;s swift defeat in April 1941, and such was the extent of the in-fighting that the government-in-exile had to ask the British military police to impose its will on its own army.

In this context, when King Peter and the rest of the government-in-exile heard reports in mid-1941 that a guerrilla movement called the Chetniks led by Colonel Draža Mihailović were fighting the Germans, he triumphantly seized upon these reports as proving that he did have an asset to the Allied cause that was tying down German forces that otherwise would be fighting on the other fronts. It was not until October 1941 that the government-in-exile was finally able to establish contact with General Mihailović. In September 1941, a liaison mission from the Special Operations Executive (SOE) parachuted into Yugoslavia to meet Mihailović, and afterwards, became the main means which Mihailović communicated with the Allies. It was through the SOE mission attached with the Chetniks that King Peter and the rest of government-in-exile communicated with Mihailović.
The news that the Croat fascists of the &quot;Ustashe&quot; had started a campaign to exterminate one-third of the &quot;prečani&quot; Serbs in the &quot;Krajina&quot; region and in Bosnia, expel another one-third and force the rest to convert to Roman Catholicism brought tensions in the government-in-exile between the Serb ministers and the few remaining Croat ministers to the boiling point and by October–November 1941, the cabinet almost collapsed. Adding to the tension was that the Croatian ministers refused to believe the reports about &quot;Ustashe&quot; atrocities, dismissing them as anti-Croat &quot;Serb propaganda&quot;, which infuriated the Serbian ministers.

Several Serb ministers told King Peter that they found it difficult to be in the same room as the Croat ministers, after they were blithely dismissive of reports of the &quot;Ustashe&quot; killing &quot;prečani&quot; Serbs in a variety of gruesome ways. Regardless, it was felt necessary to retain them in order to maintain the claim that the Yugoslav government-in-exile spoke for all the peoples of Yugoslavia. The Croat ministers were unwilling to resign, fearing a Serb-dominated government returning after the war. With neither side willing to risk the cabinet collapsing, the crisis passed. Relations between the Croat and Serb ministers remained notably cold and distant.

Disagreements had emerged over who was to head the government-in-exile. General Borivoje Mirković wanted a cabinet of generals headed by himself, which was opposed by all of the politicians and Simović. Radoje Knežević wanted a coalition government of the political parties whose leaders had chosen to go into exile. General Simović wanted a &quot;government of national salvation&quot; made up of &quot;distinguished personalities&quot; from all walks of life which he would lead, which would exclude most of the politicians.

Simović as Prime Minister had an authoritarian manner and a disdain for politicians, and was soon feuding with the rest of his cabinet, who started writing letters to Peter asking him to dismiss his overbearing prime minister. The leader of the anti-Simović group was the distinguished scholar and historian Slobodan Jovanović, who served as deputy prime minister. As a liberal Serb, he opposed the more chauvinistic Serb nationalists, and so held a degree of credibility with the non-Serb ministers. Simović felt he had a duty to &quot;tutor&quot; the teenage king in the ways of statecraft and politics, and their relation became strained. Peter found Simović to be too dominating, and resented being &quot;lectured&quot; by his prime minister. 

Outside of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia was the only place in Europe in 1941 that a full-scale guerrilla war was being waged against the Axis, leading as Pavlowitch put for Mihailović &quot;...being built up by Yugoslav and British propaganda into an Allied superman&quot;. The popularity of Mihailović in Britain helped to seal the end of Simović&#x27;s political career as the latter had been turned into a hero by the British press for leading the 27 March coup d&#x27;état, which made Peter for a long time reluctant to dismiss him. But with another Yugoslav hero in the form of Mihailović, Peter could dispense with Simović without fear of Fleet Street. 

The instructions given by the prime minister Slobodan Jovanović to Mihailović in January 1942 were to protect the &quot;prečani&quot; Serbs from the massacres being waged by the Ustashe, but otherwise he was not to engage in any actions that would bring down reprisals against civilians unless absolutely necessary while at the same time he was to build up his forces to engage in a general uprising when the Allies landed in the Balkans. In October 1941, Mihailović had already decided upon a policy of limiting the Chetniks to sabotage attacks and of building up his forces for an uprising when the Allies returned to the Balkans. The German policy that for every German soldier killed, 100 Serb civilians would be shot in reprisal and for every wounded German soldier, 50 Serb civilians would be shot in reprisal worked to deter Chetniks from attacking the Wehrmacht after October 1941 as Mihailović concluded that guerrilla attacks were not worth the reprisals.

The Chetniks were most active in Serbia and Montenegro while the Communist Partisans drew most of their support from the &quot;prečani&quot; Serbs in Bosnia and in the &quot;Krajina&quot; and from anti-fascist Croats, Slovenes and Bosnian Muslims. Unlike the Chetniks who had a narrowly Serbian and Orthodox nationalist message, the Partisans were a pan-Yugoslav force. The Partisans were considerably better organized than the Chetniks and were more willing to accept the reprisals committed against innocent civilians by the Axis when they staged guerrilla attacks, leading to a situation where the Partisans ended up doing more of the fighting against the occupiers and the collaborators, an aspect of the war in Yugoslavia which caused Britain and the United States to ultimately favor the Partisans.

At the same time, British policy in Yugoslavia was increasingly for the resistance to engage in maximum violence against the Axis in order to tie down German and Italian divisions that would otherwise be fighting the Allies, no matter what the cost in reprisals to innocent civilians, a policy that clashed with the Chetnik policy of waiting for the Allies to return to Yugoslavia before engaging in a general uprising. The very way in which Mihailović and the Chetniks had been built up in 1941 in the British media, partly by the Yugoslav government-in-exile itself, as a force of ferocious guerrillas fiercely fighting the Germans at every turn, led to very grave disappointments by 1942 when it emerged at very best the Chetniks were waiting for the British to return to the Balkans before they were willing to engage in heavy fighting.

The King completed his education at Cambridge University before being commissioned in the Royal Air Force. In mid-1941, the Yugoslav government-in-exile opened talks with the Greek government-in-exile for a post-war confederation––the Balkan Union––that would unite Yugoslavia, Greece and Bulgaria once King Boris III of Bulgaria was overthrown. The Greek prime minister Emmanouil Tsouderos supported the confederation plan, but objected to the Yugoslav plans to bring in Bulgaria and for the proposed confederation to have an executive government in charge of all economic, foreign policy and military questions, leading Tsouderous to ask the British Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden to mediate.

In July 1941, the Yugoslav government-in-exile recognized the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, and starting in September 1941 Peter regularly met with President Edvard Beneš to discuss a new Yugoslav-Czechoslovak alliance to replace the Little Entente that Beneš had negotiated with Peter&#x27;s father, King Alexander, in 1921. On 31 December 1941, the Greek-Yugoslav talks concluded and on 15 January 1942 the &quot;Accord entre le Royaume de Yougoslavie et le Royaume Grèce concernant la constitution de l&#x27;Union balkanique&quot; was signed in London. The accord committed Yugoslavia and Greece after the war to have a common currency; a customs union; to co-ordinate their foreign policies; for a military alliance with joint staff talks for a common defense plan; and a committee consisting of the Yugoslav and Greek finance ministers, foreign ministers, and defense ministers to meet regularly to plan policies for the Balkan Union.
After signing the accord, King Peter and King George II of Greece spoke to the British press at a luncheon where the two kings spoke of the &quot;Balkan Union&quot; as being open to all of the states of the Balkans. On 11 January 1942, Peter dismissed his prime minister, General Dušan Simović, who proved himself to be an inept politician who was unable to get along with his cabinet, which had been threatening to all jointly resign since late 1941 if General Simović continued as prime minister. The new prime minister was Slobodan Jovanović, a widely respected historian.

At the same time that Peter dismissed Simović, he appointed Mihailović minister of war; as Mihailović remained in Yugoslavia, his position in the cabinet was purely symbolic. On 19 January 1942 at the Dorchester Hotel in London, the king and President Beneš together with the rest of the Yugoslav and Czechoslovak cabinets had lunch together to discuss a post-war regional association. Peter in his speech noted that he was happy that two of the men who negotiated the Little Entente, Momčilo Ninčić and Edvard Beneš &quot;are here today&quot; in this room. The plans to ally the proposed Greek-Yugoslav confederation with the proposed Czechoslovak-Polish confederation that Beneš had signed with General Władysław Sikorski, the leader of the Polish government-in-exile, drew intense objections from the Soviet Union which preferred the states of eastern Europe remain separate to keep them weak.

As in Yugoslavia, the Greek resistance was divided between communists and royalists, and Tsouderos objected to Peter that his friendship with Beneš and his plans to link the &quot;Balkan Union&quot; with the Polish-Czechoslovak confederation would cause the Soviets to cease recognizing George II as the king of the Hellenes. Tsouderos&#x27;s fear was that the Soviet Union would recognize the Communist-dominated EAM as the legitimate government of Greece, and for this reason, wanted to do nothing that would antagonize Moscow. It was largely because of opposition from Tsouderos that Peter shelved his plans for a post-war Polish-Czechoslovak-Yugoslav-Greek alliance.

The very dependence of the government-in-exile on the British was a source of much tension, and Peter in 1942 tried to involve the Soviet Union and the United States as counter-balances. In 1942 Peter made a diplomatic visit to America and Canada, where he met American President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. The whirlwind tour was unsuccessful in securing Allied support for the exiled Yugoslav monarchist cause. Roosevelt and Churchill had already engaged the support of the Communist Yugoslav Government in the Allied effort to defeat Nazi Germany, with a view to ending the Second World War. Roosevelt made Yugoslavia eligible for Lend-Lease aid during Peter&#x27;s visit, but given the small size of the Yugoslav forces in exile, this was not of much assistance.

During his visit to the United States, King Peter met the Serbian-American scientist Nikola Tesla on 8 July 1942 and wrote in his diary: &quot;I visited Dr Nikola Tesla, in his apartment in the Hotel New Yorker. After I had greeted him the aged scientist said: &#x27;It is my greatest honour. I am glad you are in your youth, and I am content that you will be a great ruler. I believe I will live until you come back to a free Yugoslavia. From your father you have received his last words: &quot;Guard Yugoslavia.&quot; I am proud to be a Serbian and a Yugoslav. Our people cannot perish. Preserve the unity of all Yugoslavs – the Serbs, the Croats and the Slovenes.&#x27;&quot;
In order to obtain support from Britain, Peter put his hopes for restoration on General Draža Mihailović, the leader of the Chetniks. On 10 June 1942, Peter promoted Mihailović to full general and made him the Chief of Staff of the Royal Yugoslav Army. Pavlowitch summarized the importance of Mihailović to King Peter by noting: &quot;There was no other instance of the leader of a resistance movement being taken directly into an exiled government while remaining in occupied territory&quot;. Peter and the rest of the government-in-exile failed to appreciate that the Serb nationalism of Mihailović and the other Chetnik leaders was extremely offensive to the other peoples of Yugoslavia, all the more so as when reports of massacres committed by the Chetniks against Croats and Bosnian Muslims emerged.

For the peoples of Yugoslavia who were not Serbian, the king&#x27;s support for the Chetniks seemed to suggest that after the war he was planning to establish a state that would be dominated by chauvinistic Serb nationalists, which led to those who wanted to resist the Axis occupation to support the Partisans who at least promised to establish a state where all the peoples of Yugoslavia would be equal.

The intense Serb nationalism of the Chetniks also caused alarm in London and Washington, sparking fears about the stability of Yugoslavia if it were restructured as a Serb-dominated state, which caused some decision-makers to feel that Yugoslavia would be more stable if ruled by the Croatian Communist Josip Broz Tito. Peter&#x27;s efforts to have the United States as a counterbalance failed as the Americans shared the British frustration with the unwillingness of the Chetniks to engage in maximum violence against the Germans and were increasingly troubled by the reports that the Chetniks were collaborating with the Germans.

The Chetnik movement was motivated by a strong sense of resentment against all of the pre-war elites who were felt to have failed Yugoslavia in April 1941, and Mihailović did not have full control of his movement, being in many cases more of a figurehead whom many Chetnik commanders ignored whenever it was convenient for them. Besides for foreign policy considerations, the government-in-exile felt threatened by the anti-elitist and populist sentiments of the Chetniks and wanted to harness Mihailović to keep the Chetniks in a conservative direction.

The government-in-exile in London saw the Chetniks as a military movement whereas the Chetnik commanders saw their movement as both political and military. All of the Chetnik commanders professed to be monarchists who were loyal to King Peter, but in many cases the monarchism of the Chetniks was only superficial, being more of a legitimising device for the Chetnik leaders who justified their actions in the name of the distant king in London. Finally, the allegations, which first appeared in the press in 1942, that the Chetniks were not engaging in resistance, but instead collaborating with the Germans and the Italians in order to fight against the Communist Partisans proved to be extremely damaging to the image of King Peter in the West.

The government-in-exile tried its best to prevent the civil war between the Partisans and the Chetniks, but with no control over either the communists or the royalists, its efforts were futile. Jovanović at first tried to mediate an end to the civil war, arguing that the Partisans and Chetniks should be co-operating in fighting the Axis instead of each other, and when that failed, he tried to promote a &quot;neutrality&quot; agreement that would commit both movements from refraining from attacking each other that was likewise futile.

By 1943, the evidence that at least some Chetnik commanders were co-operating with the Axis was much stronger and Peter&#x27;s insistence on defending the Chetniks was to do his reputation enormous damage in both Britain and the United States. Peter also did nothing to silence those ministers in his government who told the Anglo-American press that the Chetniks should crush the Communist Partisans to save the pre-1941 social order, which gave the impression that the government-in-exile cared more about restoring the social order than it did about winning the war.

Pavlowitch described Peter as an &quot;immature&quot; young man who was easily manipulated by the feuding politicians within the cabinet of his government-in-exile, and as a result, he was highly inconsistent in his policies as he changed his mind depending on who had last spoken to him. The Croat ministers preferred to talk directly to the king rather than their Serb counterparts while generally none of the Serb ministers were prepared to openly challenge the king, instead of flattening his ego. Peter always spoke of enjoying &quot;ruling&quot; rather more than he did the duty of &quot;reigning&quot;, and did not behave as a strict constitutional monarch, becoming the focal point of the culture of intrigue which characterised the cabinet of the government-in-exile.

==Marriage==

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported on 1 August 1943 about the royal romance in London between King Peter and Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark that: &quot;The princess, a pretty, dark-haired girl, used to serve waffles and coffee to American officers and nurses over a snack bar at the London Red Cross club. There she met King Peter, a slender young man in naval uniform who often dropped in to listen to the music of a United States infantry band&quot;. In April 1942, Peter proposed marriage to Princess Alexandra after a few weeks of courtship and she accepted.

While the Western media portrayed a &quot;fairy tale romance&quot; across the backdrop of wartime London between the young Yugoslav king and a Greek princess, the announcement of Peter&#x27;s engagement to Alexandra in July 1943 caused immense controversy in his homeland. According to Serbian tradition, a leader must not marry during a national emergency, and the news that Peter had become engaged while his homeland was torn by war caused a backlash against him.

This was all the more so because of the catastrophic turn in Yugoslavia starting in April 1941 with war, genocide, revolution, civil war and a disastrous collapse in living standards, in what had been before 1941 one of Europe&#x27;s poorest and most backward countries, all ravaging the land. However much Peter was in love with Alexandra, his engagement and &quot;fairy tale&quot; wedding in the relative comfort of London while his subjects were suffering so much was seen as a callous break with Serbian traditions.

The cabinet in a rare show of unity had all objected to Peter&#x27;s plans for a wedding in wartime when the issue was first discussed in April 1942, and the issue was not raised again until April 1943. Again, when the matter was discussed in early 1943 the Serb ministers had objected while from Serbia itself General Mihailović reported that public opinion strongly disapproved. The Prime Minister, Slobodan Jovanović, was opposed to announcing the engagement while Yugoslavia was still occupied, predicting that the news would discredit the monarchy in Serbia, and rather than postpone the engagement, which was announced in July 1943, Peter dismissed Jovanović on 26 June 1943.

In early 1944, the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill applied strong pressure on Peter to dismiss his prime minister, Božidar Purić, whom almost everybody viewed as incompetent, and to sever his links with General Mihailović, whom Churchill was convinced by this point was a collaborator. At the same time, the British threatened to stop arms shipments to Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Partisans unless he recognized King Peter as the rightful king of Yugoslavia. Churchill wanted to preserve the Yugoslav monarchy to keep the country in the western sphere of influence after the war while incorporating the Partisans into the royalist government-in-exile.

Peter married Alexandra on 20 March 1944 at the Yugoslav legation in London. Among the guests at the ceremony, there were four reigning monarchs (George VI of the United Kingdom, who served as Peter&#x27;s best man, George II of Greece, Haakon VII of Norway and Wilhelmina of the Netherlands), Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent and several other members of European royalty, including the two brothers of the groom (Prince Tomislav and Prince Andrew), the mother of the bride Princess Aspasia of Greece and Denmark, and Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, Prince-Consort of the Netherlands. They had one son, Crown Prince Alexander, who was born on 17 July 1945.

The news that King Peter had married in wartime did much to discredit him with his people, and becoming very unsettled as it started to sink in that he might have sacrificed his throne for love, Peter became unusually open to British &quot;advice&quot; in early 1944. Churchill had announced in the House of Commons in May 1944 that Peter had dismissed Purić as Prime Minister and Mihailović as Chief of Staff and the new prime minister was Ivan Šubašić, when none of these things had actually happened.

After a week of strong British pressure, Peter capitulated and on 1 June 1944 appointed Šubašić prime minister. The mandate of the new Šubašić government was to form a coalition with Marshal Tito&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Movement. On 10 June 1944, Šubašić flew to the island of Vis to meet Tito for talks, and on 16 June 1944 it was announced that the Partisans were the only recognized agents of the government-in-exile in Yugoslavia and the governing bodies set up by the Communists were the provisional government of Yugoslavia.

Šubašić did not consult with King Peter and presented the agreement with Tito as a &quot;fait accompli&quot; to the king. The cabinet announced by Šubašić was very left-wing and on 29 August 1944 Mihailović was dismissed as chief of staff. On 12 September 1944, King Peter went on the BBC to appeal to all his subjects to support Tito and warned that the &quot;stigma of treason&quot; would stick to those who refused this command. At the same time, Stalin, anxious to allay Western fears about the future of Eastern Europe, ordered a very reluctant Tito, in a meeting in Moscow, to allow Peter to return to Yugoslavia though with the advice that he &quot;should slip a knife into his back at the appropriate moment&quot;.

==Deposition and exile==

Although the war was over, Peter was not allowed to return home. Prime Minister Šubašić arrived in Belgrade in November 1944 and shortly afterwards, went to Moscow to negotiate an agreement with Stalin; that Peter would not be allowed to return until a plebiscite was held on if Yugoslavia should become a republic or remain a monarchy. Šubašić also agreed to Stalin&#x27;s demand for a three-man regency council to govern until the plebiscite, which enraged Peter who noted that he was 21 years old and did not require a regent anymore.

Peter also objected to the regents who numbered 1 Croat, 1 Slovene and 1 Serb as they were all nominated by Tito, complaining the regents were biased against him. In March 1945, the regency council started to govern in Belgrade while a cabinet was formed what was now called the Democratic Federation of Yugoslavia numbering 28 men, of whom 23 were Partisans. The National Liberation Front government was in theory a coalition, but in fact it was a Communist-dominated regime with the non-Communist ministers there only as a &quot;window dressing&quot; to disguise the extent of Communist dominance.

The new government attempted to freeze Peter&#x27;s assets abroad, claiming that they were stolen. Peter and Tito took to denouncing each other with Tito telling the press that he was creating a democracy in Yugoslavia while Peter accused him of creating a Communist dictatorship. In the elections for the constituent assembly on 11 November 1945, there was widespread voting fraud and intimidation; with opposition newspapers prevented from having the truth published by the government denying them a voice.

Peter was deposed by Yugoslavia&#x27;s Communist Constituent Assembly on 29 November 1945 with Yugoslavia proclaimed a republic. After this declaration, he settled in the United States. In 1948, Peter visited Chicago, staying at the Drake Hotel, visited the Inland Steel works and Armour stockyards &quot;where many Yugoslavs work&quot; and spent much time at the Serbian Orthodox Seminary of St. Sava.

As a living former king of a European country, Peter was something of a novelty for Americans, and addressed various civic groups in the Midwest, for example in 1949 it was reported that the &quot;young, modern, democratic monarch who refused to accept the situation in his country&quot; spoke to the Kohler Woman&#x27;s club in Sheboygan on the subject of &quot;My kingdom for freedom&quot;. In 1951, Peter went on the &quot;Ford Festival&quot; TV show, where he was described as a &quot;sad-eyed youth&quot; who was &quot;a flop as a TV personality&quot; as he was noticeably nervous in front of the TV cameras and was quickly dismissed by the host, James Melton.

Up until his death, Peter continued to nurture hopes that one day he would be restored to the Yugoslav throne, in the words of the American journalist Peter Hockenos being a &quot;forlorn figure&quot; while &quot;rival emigre groups drew the hapless king into their incessant schemings and quarrels. The royalist community resembled a bad caricature of a powerless, squabbling diaspora&quot;. A romantic, impractical man, Peter held to a completely unrealistic hope that there were still bands of Chetniks active in the rural areas of central Serbia who would rise up at the right moment when Peter led an army of emigres in an invasion of Yugoslavia, and together they would overthrow Marshal Tito.
In 1953, the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; newspaper in London reported that Peter, who was living in France, was suffering from &quot;money tangles&quot;, had a &quot;cheque bounce in Paris&quot; and was involved in an &quot;unpleasant scene&quot; in a party in Biarritz hosted by the Marquis de Cuevas. Peter filed for divorce in 1953. He hired attorney René de Chambrun, the son-in-law of former Vichy French Prime Minister Pierre Laval. The couple reconciled in 1955.

While living in France in the 1950s, Peter, whose lifestyle was beyond his means, had a problem with the &quot;bouncing cheques&quot; he kept writing and which led him to being banned from the expensive French restaurants and hotels he loved so much, as he spent money that he did not have. The actress Ilka Chase, who met the former king and Queen Alexandra on the French Riviera in 1955, wrote: 
In 1956, Queen Alexandra published a memoir, &quot;For the Love of a King&quot;, which one American reviewer described as: 
In 1959, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported about Peter&#x27;s visit to the Chicago suburb of Waukegan:


==Final years and death==
From 1964 to his death Peter served as the Royal Patron of the Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem in the United States. In 1963, Alexandra, who was suffering from severe depression, tried to commit suicide. Peter himself suffered from depression and alcoholism, and his heavy drinking caused him to suffer from cirrhosis of the liver. As the Chicago area had a substantial Yugoslav immigrant population, Peter spent much of his exile in Chicago, where he maintained ties with anti-communist Serbian emigres, especially with the Serbian National Defense Council.

The Non-Aligned Movement of the Third World nations, which had as one of its leaders Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia, was felt to be useful for American foreign policy in the Cold War as being disruptive to the Soviet bloc, creating the example of a communist regime in eastern Europe that was independent of the Soviet Union. The United States did not wish to push Tito towards the Kremlin by supporting the Serb royalist movement.

In 1963, Peter told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;: &quot;The State Department has told me that I am a guest in your country, and so I must not discuss American foreign policy towards Yugoslavia.&quot; Instead, Peter frequently attended various civic events in the Chicago area, speaking at a fundraiser for the Knights of Malta in 1964, hosting the local meeting of the &quot;Alliance Francaise&quot; in 1965, attending a memorial for General Mihailović at the Milhailovich Memorial Home in 1966 and in 1967 attending an event for the Knights of Malta where he knighted &quot;50 persons from Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin&quot;. In 1967, Peter took on a job for the first time in his life, working for the Sterling Savings &amp; Loan Association in Los Angeles. When asked about the press if working for a living would hurt his image as a king, Peter replied: &quot;I think it raises my stature a little.&quot;

After many years of suffering from cirrhosis, he died in Denver, Colorado, at Denver Health Medical Center on 3 November 1970, after a failed liver transplant. He was interred in Saint Sava Monastery Church at Libertyville, Illinois, the only European monarch so far to have been buried in the United States.

In the 1980s, the American soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot; was shown on Yugoslav television. As one of the stars of &quot;Dynasty&quot;, the actress Catherine Oxenberg, is descended from the House of Karađorđević, being the granddaughter of the Prince Regent Paul, this sparked immense national pride in Serbia and by 1990 led to a major revival of popular interest in the House of Karađorđević, which was exploited by the regime of Slobodan Milošević to burnish its nationalist line. The revival of Karađorđević nostalgia led to something of a popular rehabilitation of King Peter, whose death in 1970 had been barely noticed in his homeland.

==Return of remains and state funeral==

On 4 March 2007, former Crown Prince Alexander announced plans to have his father&#x27;s remains repatriated to Serbia. Peter II had chosen St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Monastery as his interim resting place because of the extenuating circumstances that afflicted his homeland. After talks with the Serbian government, the move was confirmed in January 2013 with the burial place being the Royal Family Mausoleum in Oplenac.

On 22 January 2013, Peter&#x27;s remains were returned to Belgrade. He was laid in state in the Royal Chapel in Dedinje before being buried in the Royal Family Mausoleum at Oplenac on 26 May 2013 along with his wife, Queen Alexandra. His mother, Queen Maria, and his brother, Prince Andrej, lie nearby. The Serbian Royal Regalia were placed over Peter&#x27;s coffin. Present at the return ceremony were the Prime Minister Ivica Dačić, Peter&#x27;s son Alexander with his family, and Serbian Patriarch Irinej. The latter openly advocated for the restoration of the Serbian monarchy.

<text>Tortoise is an American post-rock band formed in Chicago, Illinois in 1990. The band incorporates krautrock, dub, minimal music, electronica and jazz into their music, and their eclectic style has left a great influence on the post-rock genre. Tortoise have been consistently credited for the rise of the post-rock movement in the 1990s.

==History==
=== 1990s ===
The group&#x27;s origins lie in the late 1980s pairing of Doug McCombs (bassist with Eleventh Dream Day) and drummer John Herndon, who initially wanted to establish themselves as a freelance rhythm section (like reggae legends Sly and Robbie). The idea did not come to fruition, but their interest in grooving rhythms, as well as their recording studio knowledge led to partnerships with drummer John McEntire and bassist Bundy K. Brown (both formerly of Bastro and Gastr Del Sol) joining, followed by percussionist Dan Bitney. Though songs are credited to all the musicians, McEntire became perceived as the group&#x27;s guiding force, as his contributions mainly took the form of being the recording engineer and mixer.

Their first single was issued in 1993, and their self-titled debut album followed a year later. Instrumental and mostly mid-tempo, &quot;Tortoise&quot; slowly garnered praise and attention, notably for its unusual instrumentation (two bass guitars, three percussionists switching between drums, vibraphones and marimbas). A remix album followed, &quot;Rhythms, Resolutions and Clusters&quot;.

Brown left and was replaced by David Pajo (formerly of Slint) for 1996&#x27;s &quot;Millions Now Living Will Never Die&quot;, which showed up on many year-end best of lists, and the 20-minute &quot;Djed&quot; was described by critic John Bush as proof that &quot;Tortoise made experimental rock do double duty as evocative, beautiful music.&quot; Also in 1996, the band contributed to the AIDS benefit album &quot;&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization.

They released a Japanese-only compilation featuring tracks from the eponymous debut, &quot;Rhythms&quot;, singles and compilation appearances, named &quot;A Digest Compendium of the Tortoise&#x27;s World&quot; on November 21, 1996.

In 1998, Tortoise released &quot;TNT&quot;, arguably their most jazz-inflected album. Jeff Parker had joined as a guitarist alongside Pajo, who left the band following the album&#x27;s completion.

=== 2000s–present ===
2001 led to &quot;Standards&quot;, where Tortoise incorporated more electronic sounds and post-production into its music than in previous works. In 2001, the band curated an edition of the British All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival. They then returned in 2004 to curate another day of the same event.

&quot;It&#x27;s All Around You&quot; was released in 2004. In 2006, Tortoise collaborated with Bonnie &#x27;Prince&#x27; Billy on an album of covers entitled &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;, and released &quot;A Lazarus Taxon&quot;, a box set containing two CDs of single tracks and remixes, a third CD with an expanded &quot;Rhythms, Resolutions and Clusters&quot; (out of print) and a DVD of videos and film of live performances. In 2001, the band recorded &quot;Didjeridoo&quot; for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Red Hot + Indigo&quot;, a tribute to Duke Ellington, which raised money for various charities devoted to AIDS related causes.

Bitney and McEntire also contributed to the Bright Eyes album &quot;Cassadaga&quot;. The group has worked with multi-instrumentalist Paul Duncan of the band Warm Ghost.

Tortoise released their sixth album, &quot;Beacons of Ancestorship&quot;, on June 23, 2009. The band toured the Midwestern US in September and October 2009, and then in Europe in November and December. The band performed at the ATP New York 2010 music festival, which was held in Monticello, New York.

In 2012, Tortoise wrote and recorded the soundtrack to Eduardo Sánchez&#x27;s &quot;Lovely Molly&quot;, a psychological horror film partly inspired by traditional folk songs. A seventh studio album, &quot;The Catastrophist&quot;, was released by Thrill Jockey in early 2016, preceded by the single &quot;Gesceap&quot;.

==Musical style==
As Tortoise rose to prominence in their early career, their often instrumental music has been noted for its ambiguous categorization. The members have roots in Chicago&#x27;s fertile music scene, playing in various indie rock and punk rock groups. Tortoise was among the first American indie rock bands to incorporate styles closer to krautrock, dub, minimal music, electronica and various jazz styles, rather than the strong rock and roll roots that had dominated the genre.

Tortoise has been cited as one of the prime forces behind the development and popularity of the post-rock movement. CMJ writer Jim Allen highlighted the influence of progressive rock on Tortoise&#x27;s post-rock style.

Other groups related to Tortoise include The Sea and Cake, Brokeback, Slint, Isotope 217, Chicago Odense Ensemble, Tar Babies, and the Chicago Underground Duo. Tortoise records on the Thrill Jockey label.

<text>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a 1998 neo-noir black comedy crime film written and directed by Guy Ritchie. It follows a heist involving a confident young card sharp who loses £500,000 to a powerful crime lord in a rigged game of three-card brag, prompting him to pay off his debts by enlisting his friends to help him rob a small-time gang operating out of the apartment next door. It stars an ensemble cast featuring Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran, Jason Statham, Steven Mackintosh, Vinnie Jones, and Sting.

The film brought Ritchie international acclaim and introduced Statham (a former diver) and Jones (a former footballer) to worldwide audiences in their feature film debuts. It was also a commercial success, grossing over $28 million at the box office against a $1.35 million budget. A television spin-off called &quot;Lock, Stock...&quot; followed in 2000, running for seven episodes.

== Plot ==
Long-time friends and small-time London criminals Eddie, Tom, Soap, and Bacon put together £100,000 so that Eddie, a card sharp, can participate in one of &quot;Hatchet&quot; Harry Lonsdale&#x27;s high-stakes three-card brag games. The game, however, is rigged and they wind up owing £500,000 to Harry, to be paid within a week. Harry sends his debt collector Big Chris to Eddie&#x27;s father JD, since Harry&#x27;s true intention is to acquire JD&#x27;s bar in payment of the debt.

Also interested in two expensive antique Holland &amp; Holland shotguns up for auction, Harry gets his enforcer Barry &quot;the Baptist&quot; to hire two thieves, Gary and Dean, to steal them from a bankrupt lord. After the incompetent thieves unwittingly sell them to Nick &quot;the Greek&quot;, a local fence, Barry threatens them into retrieving the guns. Meanwhile, Eddie returns home and overhears his neighbours, a gang of robbers led by a brutal man called &quot;Dog&quot;, planning a heist on some cannabis growers loaded with cash and drugs. He tells the other three and they decide to rob the neighbours after they return from their heist. Tom buys the shotguns from Nick (both unaware of their true value), for use in the plan.

Dog&#x27;s gang execute their heist, and despite a gang member&#x27;s death by his own Bren gun and an incriminating encounter with a traffic warden, they succeed, returning with a duffel bag full of money and a van loaded with bags of cannabis. Eddie and his friends ambush them and escape in the van containing the cannabis and the warden. They transfer the loot to their own van and return home, knocking out the warden and dumping him by the road before arranging for Nick to fence the drugs to violent gangster Rory Breaker. Rory agrees to buy the cannabis at half price but two of his men visit the house of the growers, discover that they have been robbed and the cannabis he just bought has been stolen from his own growers. Rory threatens Nick into giving him Eddie&#x27;s address and tasks one of the two surviving growers, Winston, to identify the robbers.

While the friends celebrate at JD&#x27;s bar, Dog&#x27;s crew, having accidentally discovered that they were robbed by their neighbours, set up an ambush in Eddie&#x27;s flat. Rory and his gang arrive at the flat instead and in the ensuing shoot-out, all except Dog and Winston are killed. Winston leaves with the drugs. Dog attempts to escape with the shotguns and the cash but Big Chris arrives, incapacitates him, and takes both. Attempting to recover the guns, Gary and Dean follow Chris, oblivious to the fact that Chris is bringing them to Harry.

Having delivered the money and guns to Harry, Chris returns to his car to find Dog holding his son Little Chris at knifepoint, demanding the cash be returned to him. Chris complies and starts the car. Meanwhile, Gary and Dean burst into Harry&#x27;s office. The ensuing confrontation results in the deaths of Gary, Dean, Barry and Harry.
Having discovered the carnage at their flat and their loot missing, the four friends head to Harry&#x27;s office, finding a second set of corpses, and decide to take the money for themselves. Chris deliberately crashes into their car to disable Dog and then fatally bludgeons him with his car door. He then retrieves the cash from the unconscious Eddie but allows Tom to leave with the shotguns after a brief stand-off.

The friends are arrested but soon released after the warden identifies Dog and his crew as the culprits. Back at the bar, Eddie, Bacon and Soap dispatch Tom to discard the guns, as they are the only remaining evidence linking them to the case. While Tom is away, Chris arrives to announce his intentions of leaving the friends alone, but warns them not to seek him out in the future. Chris then returns the bag, from which he has taken all the cash for himself and his son and which is now empty save for a catalogue of antique weapons. Leafing through the catalogue, the three friends learn that the shotguns are actually far more valuable than they had realised and frantically call Tom to dissuade him from disposing of them. The film ends with Tom leaning over Southwark Bridge, holding his mobile phone ringing in his mouth, as he attempts to drop the guns into the River Thames.

;Release history
==Production==

The production of the film followed Guy Ritchie&#x27;s single short film which preceded &quot;Lock, Stock&quot;. As stated in filmscouts.com:Although it was Ritchie&#x27;s first feature, his previous short film &quot;The Hard Case&quot; was sufficiently impressive to secure interest not only from financial backers but also persuaded Sting to take the role of JD. &quot;I&#x27;d seen Guy&#x27;s short film and was excited by the pace and energy in it. The way in which he handles violence and action appealed to me. I don&#x27;t like gratuitous violence. I think it&#x27;s much more chilling when it&#x27;s suggested rather than graphic.&quot; For Ritchie, getting exactly the right actor for each role was essential. &quot;The casting took forever and we auditioned hundreds of people, but I was determined to hold out until we got the real McCoy.&quot; This led to employing several genuine ex-cons, who certainly invest the film with its menacing undertones. Ritchie also looked to the celebrity arena to secure the right cast such as Vinnie Jones. &quot;I didn&#x27;t hesitate in casting Vinnie as I have the most incredible respect for his acting capabilities.&quot;

A one-hour documentary of the production of the film was released featuring much of the cast along with Ritchie.

Locations include Shoreditch for the gang hideout and Clerkenwell for JD&#x27;s bar.

The film was Lenny McLean&#x27;s final film appearance, as he died in July 1998, shortly before the film&#x27;s release.

==Release==
Summit Entertainment acquired worldwide rights to the film excluding the UK upon its premiere at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, which already held UK rights, acquiring distribution rights for North America (with PolyGram-subsidiary Gramercy Pictures distributing the film in the United States), Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Austria, the Benelux, France, Spain and Switzerland from Summit, with Summit handling international sales in all other regions.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was released on 28 August 1998 in the United Kingdom and was the second-highest grossing local production for the year behind &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; with a gross of $18.9 million. It was released on 5 March 1999 in the United States, where its total gross was .

===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 75% based on 67 reviews, with an average rating of 6.70/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; is a grimy, twisted, and funny twist on the Tarantino hip gangster formula&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on 30 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

John Ferguson in &quot;Radio Times&quot; called the film &quot;the best British crime movie since &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot;. Roger Ebert in &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Lock, Stock&quot; is fun, in a slapdash way; it has an exuberance, and in a time when movies follow formulas like zombies, it&#x27;s alive&quot;.&quot;&quot;

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for a British Academy Film Award in 1998 for the outstanding British Film of the Year. In 1999, it was nominated for a Brit Award for Soundtrack/Cast Recording. In 2000, Ritchie won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. In 2004, &quot;Total Film&quot; named it the 38th greatest British film of all time. In 2016, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Lock, Stock&quot; 75th on their list of the 100 best British films.

==Television==
A spin-off television series, co-written by Ritchie was developed for Channel 4. The show featured a new cast of characters: Moon, Jamie, Bacon, and Lee (portrayed by Daniel Caltagirone, Scott Maslen, Shaun Parkes, and Del Synnott, respectively); who comedically fail at various criminal business ventures, similar to the cast of the feature film. &quot;Lock, Stock...&quot; aired from May 29 through July 11, 2000.

<doc id="210155" wikidata="Q1051469" url="?curid=210155" title="The Core">
<text>The Core is a 2003 American science fiction disaster film directed by Jon Amiel and starring Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Delroy Lindo, Stanley Tucci, D. J. Qualls, Richard Jenkins, Tcheky Karyo, Bruce Greenwood, and Alfre Woodard.

The film focuses on a team whose mission is to drill to the center of the Earth and set off a series of nuclear explosions in order to restart the rotation of the Earth&#x27;s core.

The film was released on March 28, 2003, by Paramount Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $74 million worldwide with a production budget of $85 million.

==Plot==

Several small, disparate incidents involving the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field cause geophysicist Dr. Josh Keyes and scientists Dr. Serge Leveque and Dr. Conrad Zimsky to conclude that the Earth&#x27;s molten core has somehow stopped rotating. Unless restarted, the field is set to collapse within months, exposing the surface to devastating solar radiation.

The U.S. government backs a secret project to build a vessel to drill to the core and release nuclear weapons to restart the rotation. They utilize the work of Dr. Ed &quot;Braz&quot; Brazzelton who has developed &quot;Unobtainium&quot;, a material that can withstand the extreme pressure and convert intense heat into electricity, as well as a laser-based high-speed drilling array.

NASA pilots Commander Robert Iverson and Major Rebecca &quot;Beck&quot; Childs are enlisted to pilot the multi-compartment vessel &quot;Virgil&quot;, while computer hacker Theodore Donald &quot;Rat&quot; Finch is brought on to both keep news of the pending disaster and their attempt to restart the core off the Internet.

&quot;Virgil&quot; is launched through the Marianas Trench and makes its way through the crust. While traversing the mantle, the team accidentally drills through a gigantic empty geode structure, damaging the lasers when it lands at its base. As they traverse outside the ship to free the vessel, the geode is flooded with magma, and Iverson is killed by a falling shard. The rest return in time as &quot;Virgil&quot; continues its descent.

Further down, as &quot;Virgil&quot; passes through a field of enormous diamond formations, one of them breaches the last compartment housing the detonation timers for the nuclear charges. Leveque sacrifices himself to ensure the others have the charges and launch codes before the compartment is crushed.

The team reaches the molten core and realizes it is much &quot;less&quot; dense than previously believed, throwing off their calculations on restarting its motions. Communicating with the surface, overseer of the operation Lieutenant General Thomas Purcell, orders them to abandon the effort and return immediately as they plan to use a secondary protocol to restart the core. Finch is secretly communicating with the &quot;Virgil&quot; team and learns that this secondary protocol is the top-secret project DESTINI (Deep Earth Seismic Trigger INItiative).

Keyes discovers Zimsky was a lead scientist on DESTINI, a U.S. tectonic weapon that, when first tested, accidentally stopped the core&#x27;s rotation. Finch redirects power from DESTINI to prevent Purcell from reactivating it, as Keyes fears that could destroy the Earth instead of restarting the core. Meanwhile, destructive events, including a lightning storm in Rome and a burst of ultraviolet rays that destroys the Golden Gate Bridge, alert the world to the situation despite Finch&#x27;s best efforts to keep the bad news from becoming public knowledge.

On &quot;Virgil&quot;, the remaining team plans to place a bomb in each of the remaining compartments, jettison them, and time their detonations in an exact sequence to trigger the core&#x27;s rotation through constructive wave interference, where the force of each blast will push against the next. However, the override mechanism to permit detachment of each compartment is located externally and Brazzelton dies in sacrificing himself to engage it.

As they set the charges, Keyes and Zimsky realize that they need &quot;more&quot; explosive power than previously thought and in their race to adjust timings, Zimsky becomes trapped in a detached compartment. Keyes uses &quot;Virgil&quot;″s nuclear power source to provide the additional energy for the final detonation. While it leaves the main compartment powerless and Keyes and Childs trapped, the other explosions successfully restart the core&#x27;s rotation.

Keyes recalls that the unobtainium shell can convert heat and pressure to energy, and the two of them wire the shell directly to their systems in time to power the craft and ride the pressure wave out of the core and towards the surface through tectonic plates, eventually breaching into the ocean floor near Hawaii. Due to the cold water &quot;Virgil&quot; no longer has power to establish communications. The government searches for them, and Finch, tracking nearby whale sound, realizes that the &quot;Virgil&quot; crew are using low-power ultrasound to draw whales nearby. Keyes and Childs are soon rescued.

In the aftermath, Finch uploads information about &quot;Virgil&quot; and its team and the classified information about DESTINI across the Internet, causing the world to revere the crew as heroes.

==Production==
&quot;The Core&quot; began development in the late 1990s under producer David Foster for Paramount Pictures and was one of several &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; inspired projects in development at the time along with &quot;Inner Earth&quot; at 20th Century Fox and a straight adaptation of the novel at Walt Disney Pictures. Initially Peter Hyams had been announced to be in final negotiations to direct. In September 2001, it was announced Jon Amiel had signed on to direct. That same month, it was announced Aaron Eckhart had signed on to star in the film with co-star Hilary Swank joining the following month in October.

&quot;The Core&quot; had out-to-sea scenes, starring , with full support of the US Navy.

The original plan for the shuttle landing scene had been for &quot;Endeavour&quot; to attempt a landing at Los Angeles International Airport with the shuttle coming to a halt on the nearby beaches. However, due to the events of September 11, 2001, the crew was not allowed to film at LAX. The scene was therefore rewritten with &quot;Endeavour&quot; landing in the L.A. River.

==Reception==
&quot;The Core&quot; garnered mixed reviews from critics. On Metacritic, another aggregation website, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100 based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. In his review, Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four and said &quot;I have such an unreasonable affection for this movie, indeed, that it is only by slapping myself alongside the head and drinking black coffee that I can restrain myself from recommending it.&quot;

The film grossed $31.1 million in United States theaters, and another $43.0 million overseas for a total worldwide gross of $74.1 million against a production budget of $85 million.

Several reviews cited the numerous scientific inaccuracies in the film. Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;The brazen silliness of &quot;The Core&quot; is becalming and inauthentic, like taking a bath in nondairy coffee creamer. The Earth core&#x27;s inability to turn is mirrored in the cast&#x27;s inability to give the picture any spin.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was a little more forgiving, saying: &quot;If &quot;The Core&quot; finally has to be classified as a mess, it is an enjoyable one if you&#x27;re in a throwback mood. After all, a film that comes up with a rare metal called unobtainium can&#x27;t be dismissed out of hand.&quot;

In response to criticism of his screenplay&#x27;s lack of scientific realism, screenwriter John Rogers responded that he tried to make the science accurate, but expended three years fighting &quot;to get rid of the ... dinosaurs, magma-walks in &#x27;space-suits&#x27;, bullshit-sci-crap sources for the Earth&#x27;s crisis, and a windshield for the ship &quot;Virgil&quot;.&quot;

On March 30, 2009, it was reported that Dustin Hoffman was leading a campaign to get more real science into science-fiction movies. Hoffman is on the advisory board of the Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange, an initiative of the United States National Academy of Sciences, intended to foster collaborations between scientists and entertainment industry professionals in order to minimize inaccurate representations of science and technology such as those found in &quot;The Core&quot;.

In a poll of hundreds of scientists about bad science fiction films, &quot;The Core&quot; was voted the worst.

On February 21, 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ran an article about American professor Sidney Perkowitz&#x27;s proposals to curb bad science in science fiction movies. In the article, Perkowitz is said to have hated &quot;The Core&quot;. &quot;If you violate [the coherent rules of science] you are in trouble. The chances are that the public will pick it up and that is what matters to Hollywood. &quot;The Core&quot; did not make money because people understood the science was so out to lunch&quot;.

<text>Aston University (abbreviated as Aston for post-nominals) is a public university situated in the city centre of Birmingham, England. Aston began as the Birmingham Municipal Technical School in 1895, evolving into the UK&#x27;s first college of advanced technology in 1956. Aston University received its royal charter from Queen Elizabeth II on 22 April 1966.

Aston pioneered the integrated placement year concept over 50 years ago, and more than 73% of Aston students take a placement year, the highest percentage in the UK. The annual income of the institution for 2021–22 was £197.7 million of which £19.3 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £219.4 million.

In 2020, Aston University was named &quot;University of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and the newspaper also awarded Aston Students&#x27; Union its &quot;Buildings That Inspire&quot; award. The Times Higher Education Awards named Aston University as its &quot;Outstanding Entrepreneurial University&quot; in 2020.

In September 2021, Aston was shortlisted for University of the Year in the Times Higher Education Awards 2021.

In March 2024, it was announced that Aston University had become the second university in England to be awarded the Athena SWAN Gold Award at an institutional level in recognition of efforts to promote gender equality.

==History==

===Predecessor institutions===
The origins of Aston University are a School of Metallurgy formed in the Birmingham and Midland Institute in 1875. The Birmingham Municipal Technical School separated from the Institute in 1895, teaching chemistry, physics, metallurgy and electrical engineering; it expanded and by 1917 was also teaching botany and other subjects to trainee teachers. In 1911, commercial classes were introduced and grew into an independent School of Commerce by 1916. The school changed its name in 1927 to the Birmingham Central Technical College, to reflect its changing approach to teaching technology.


In 1951, the Technical College was renamed the &quot;College of Technology, Birmingham&quot;, and work began on the Main Building at Gosta Green. In 1956, it became the first elite designated college of advanced technology and underwent a major expansion. It moved into buildings that were constructed between 1949 and 1955 to a design by Ashley &amp; Newman. Princess Margaret laid one of the first foundation stones at the base of the new building in 1951. The building is one of Europe&#x27;s largest freestanding brick buildings. In 1955, the College of Advanced Technology was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. The college expanded again to a design by the City Architect of Birmingham Alwyn Sheppard Fidler between 1957 and 1965.

===University status===
It officially became the &quot;University of Aston in Birmingham&quot; on receipt of its royal charter on 22 April 1966, and the first chancellor of the university, Lord Nelson of Stafford, was installed on 10 May. The charter of the university outlines objectives appropriate to a technological university: &quot;to advance, disseminate and apply learning and knowledge by teaching and research, for the benefit of industry and commerce and of the community generally: and to enable students to obtain the advantage of a university education, and such teaching and research may include periods outside the University in industry or commerce or wherever the University considers proper for the best advancement of its objects.&quot; The emphasis given to the sandwich course system, and the maintenance of strong links with industry, arises naturally from the institution&#x27;s history. The motto of the university is the same as that of the City of Birmingham – &quot;Forward&quot;.

In 1983, Aston University, in partnership with Birmingham City Council and Lloyds Bank, established Birmingham Technology Ltd., which manages the Aston Science Park adjacent to the university site. The establishment of the Aston Science Park and Aston University&#x27;s contribution to the city of Birmingham was fully recognised when the area was granted its own postal address &quot;The Aston Triangle&quot; in 1984, emphasising the campus as an official district of Birmingham. The logo of the establishment takes from the shape of the area.

===2000 to present===
Aston University hosted the British Science Festival in September 2010, said to be Europe&#x27;s largest public science event.

Since May 2011, Sir John Sunderland has been the Chancellor of Aston University.

The university is a lead sponsor of Aston University Engineering Academy, a university technical college (UTC) which opened in September 2012. The UTC is for students aged 14 to 19 wishing to pursue further study and careers in engineering, and is located at the edge of the Aston University campus.

In October 2014, Aston announced plans to launch Aston Medical School in October 2015. The university also announced a £35 million cash injection for a major upgrade of the campus, including a new £19 million revamp of Aston Business School and improvement work to the Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies and the School of Languages and Social Sciences.

In February 2017, Aston University launched its online programme website. Four of their MSc programmes are offered 100% online to students in the UK and worldwide, including the Aston Business School&#x27;s MBA.

In July 2017, Aston became the first University in the UK to have degree apprenticeship graduates. Aston began working in close partnership with Capgemini, to create the first degree apprenticeship: Digital and Technology Solutions in 2012.

In 2021, the university announced plans to close its Department of History, Languages and Translation, focusing instead on health, engineering, and business. This decision led to protests from members of the university, as well as humanities scholars broadly. Professional groups, including the Royal Historical Society and the American Historical Association, condemned the move, and public figures, including Sir Keith Burnett and Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green criticised the university leadership. Facing public opposition and protests from staff and students, university officials reversed their position and agreed to save the History programme, although cuts to language instruction would continue.

==Campus==
Established in 1895 as the Birmingham Municipal Technical School, The university is situated on a 60-acre campus at Gosta Green, in the city centre of Birmingham, England. As well as being home to over 3,000 students, the Aston University campus has the following amenities available: sports centres, swimming pool, 120 station gym, library, cafés, restaurants, pubs, shops, travel centre, hairdresser, health centre, dentist, places of worship, opticians, a bank, automated teller machines and plenty of outside space.

It provides online access to over 40 electronic databases and more than 3,400 electronic journals. The library is open 24 hours a day to Aston students and staff during exam time, and on average, around 12 hours a day during term time.

Around the campus there are also various open-access IT suites, offering computer and internet access 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They offer access to a range of software packages, database systems and computer-aided learning materials.

===Sports===
The Aston&#x27;s sports facilities include a 25 m swimming pool, sauna and steam room, two sports halls, 120-station gym, weights and fitness rooms, two-storey dance studio and 35 sports clubs. The campus also has two 3G floodlit sports pitches. Clubs train and compete, many in the British Universities and Colleges Sports (BUCS) Leagues. Off campus the university manages a 40-acre sports ground with floodlit pitches, pavilion for all outdoor sports.

===Coat of arms===

The university&#x27;s arms were granted on 18 March 1955 by Garter, Clarenceux and Norroy and Ulster kings of Arms to the Birmingham Corporation, for use by the former College of Technology. They were designed to show the college&#x27;s connection with the city and with the teaching of technology. The arms consist of a shield and crest. The shield has two sections – the field (the main background) which is coloured blue and a chief (the broad band across the top of the shield) of silver. On the field is a diagonal line of five gold diamonds joined one to the other, similar to the first quarter of the Arms of the City of Birmingham and incorporated in the Arms of the college to show its connection with the city. This was adopted by the family of Birmingham which derived its name from the then hamlet of Birmingham, and provided the Lords of the Manor from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries. On the chief is depicted an open book bound in red placed between two black hammers, showing the connection of the university with technology, the book representing learning and the hammers engineering and allied trades.

The crest is also designed to stress the pursuit of knowledge. It consists of a red torch held erect by a forearm between two branches of gold laurel. Having been originally worn on the helmet of a fully armed person, the crest is always placed on the top of the helm. The method of joining the crest to the helm was usually concealed by decoration and, in the university&#x27;s arms, this is effected by the use of a wreath and a crown. The wreath is silver, red and black, these colours being taken from the shield. It is surmounted by a mural crown (resembling a wall), which is reserved in modern grants for persons and organisations connected with public corporations. The cloth mantling which hangs down from the top of the helm is the survival of the cloak which was originally worn to protect the armour, coloured in the two principal colours of the shield, blue and gold.

In 2016, to mark the 50th anniversary of the university, Her Majesty&#x27;s College of Arms granted the favour of supporters to Aston University&#x27;s arms, following a request from the Vice-Chancellor, Julia King, the Baroness Brown of Cambridge.
On 29 September, during a service at St Phillips Cathedral, The Letters Patent was formally presented to Aston University by the York Herald, Michael Peter Desmond O&#x27;Donoghue Esq..
The arms are supported by a Canada goose and a red squirrel. The Canada goose represents the family of geese living on the university campus. The squirrel is the crest of the arms of Aston Manor and is a rebus. (The picture is a pun on the persons name. The owners of Aston Manor were the Holte family and a squirrel&#x27;s nest is called a holt). This explains the ancient connection between the squirrel and Aston. The animal also appears on the university mace and on the chancellor&#x27;s chain of office. This chain was originally the property of the mayor of Aston Manor.
The gorse around the animals&#x27; necks is a reference to Gosta Green. During the 18th century, it was known as &quot;Gostie&quot; Green, this combined the name of the landowner (William de Gorsty) with the local plant called &#x27;gorse&#x27;.

===Rankings and reputation===


Aston University has been ranked in the top 25 of UK institutions in the 2022 Guardian University Guide.

Aston University holds an overall Gold rating as part of the UK Government&#x27;s 2023 Teaching Excellence Framework. The framework evaluates universities on criteria including teaching quality, learning environment and student outcomes, taking into account factors such as student satisfaction, retention rates and employment.

Many factors make up the overall League Table rankings; Aston prides itself on consistently strong performances for the metrics related to student outcome successes. For example, in the 2021 &quot;Guardian&quot; University Guide Aston are ranked 11th in the UK for ‘Continuation’ which measures the proportion of students that drop-out of university following their first year. The 2021 &quot;Guardian&quot; Guide also ranks Aston joint 24th in the UK for ‘Value Added’ which compares student University grades against their expected grades based on entry qualifications.

In addition to this, the 2021 &quot;Times&quot;/&quot;Sunday Times&quot; Good University Guide ranks Aston University 31st in the UK for the proportion of students achieving a 1st or 2:1 degree classification, and the same publication ranks Aston 30th in the UK for ‘Graduate Prospects’, based on the proportion of graduates in a professional level job or further study within 15 months of graduation.

In addition to these immediate successes of Aston&#x27;s students and graduates, there is also evidence of strong long-term benefits of Aston degrees, as the 2020 Longitudinal Education Outcomes study found that Aston graduates had the 15th largest median salary of all UK institutions 5 years after graduation.

===Research===
In the latest 2021 Research Excellence Framework, which assesses the quality of research in UK higher education institutions, Aston is ranked joint 58th by GPA and 56th for research power (the grade point average score of a university, multiplied by the full-time equivalent number of researchers submitted). In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), 88% of Aston academic staff were submitted for research assessment, one of the highest proportions in the UK. According to the RAE, the university&#x27;s strengths include Business and Management, General Engineering, Subjects Allied to Medicine (Optometry, Biology, Pharmacy and Psychology), Languages and European Studies.

===Admissions===

== Student life ==

===Students&#x27; Union===
Aston Students&#x27; Union (SU) (formerly Guild) is a non-profit, independent charity set up with the aim of representing and supporting its members who are primarily current students at Aston University. The SU operates a number of commercial and non-commercial services including; the Advice &amp; Representation Centre (ARC), the Aston Athletic Union which supports the university sports clubs, the Aston Societies Federation which supports a large number of non-sporting societies, the SU Shop, Copyshop and B4 Bar. The SU is funded by grant income from Aston University and by funds raised by the SU&#x27;s commercial services. The SU is led by a Trustee Board consisting of elected students and external trustees. Day-to-day management is by a team of permanent staff and by an elected student team called the Executive Committee. The SU building consists of 5 floors and is located in the centre of the Aston University Campus. The Union received a block grant of over £2.1 million from the university in 2022 

On 29 November 2006, the students voted to disaffiliate the Guild (now Union) from the National Union of Students, but voted to re-affiliate on 26 November 2014.

===Student housing===
All of the student housing that Aston owned was sold to UNITE Students in 2016. In the 1970s, three tower blocks containing student accommodation were constructed on Aston University campus; Dalton, Lawrence and Stafford Towers. In April 2007, Aston University submitted a planning application for demolition of the three 1970s towers and to replace them with new student accommodation blocks as well as apartments for tutors, retail units and administrative offices. Lawrence and Dalton Towers were demolished on 8 May 2011. Stafford Tower, Gem Sports Centre and Lakeside Conference Centre were demolished on 27 April 2014 to make way for a new entrance to Aston University and a five-acre green space. The new landscaped area includes a new walkway into the university from the city centre and a pavilion, to be used for teaching and as a catering facility for outdoor events. The new buildings are named the William Murdoch, the James Watt, the Harriet Martineau and the Mary Sturge Residences.

Another addition to Aston University student dwelling stock is the Lakeside complex on campus which was completed in August 1999.

<doc id="210162" wikidata="Q451799" url="?curid=210162" title="William F. Albright">
<text>William Foxwell Albright (May 24, 1891– September 19, 1971) was an American archaeologist, biblical scholar, philologist, and expert on ceramics. He is considered &quot;one of the twentieth century&#x27;s most influential American biblical scholars&quot;, having become known to the public in 1948 for his role in the authentication of the Dead Sea Scrolls. His scholarly reputation arose as a leading theorist and practitioner of biblical archaeology.

Albright was a leading theorist and practitioner of biblical archaeology, and is regarded as the founder of the biblical archaeology movement. He served as the W. W. Spence Professor of Semitic Languages at Johns Hopkins University from 1930 to 1958 and was the Director of the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem for several terms between 1922 and 1936. Albright made significant contributions to the fields of Near Eastern studies, biblical archaeology, and ceramic typology, and his work has had a lasting impact on the understanding of ancient Near Eastern history and the historicity of the Bible.

==Biography==
Albright was born on May 24, 1891, in Coquimbo, Chile, the eldest of six children of the American Evangelical Methodist missionaries Wilbur Finley Albright and Cornish-American Zephine Viola Foxwell. Albright was an alumnus of Upper Iowa University. He married Ruth Norton in 1921 and had four sons. He received his Doctor of Philosophy degree from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1916 and accepted a professorship there in 1927. Albright was W. W. Spence Professor of Semitic Languages from 1930 until his retirement in 1958. He was the Director of the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem from 1922–1929, and 1933–1936, and did important archaeological work at sites in Palestine such as Gibeah (Tell el-Fûl, 1922) and Tell Beit Mirsim (1926, 1928, 1930, and 1932).

Albright became known to the public in 1948 for his role in the authentication of the Dead Sea Scrolls, but made his scholarly reputation as the leading theorist and practitioner of biblical archaeology, &quot;that branch of archaeology that sheds light upon &#x27;the social and political structure, the religious concepts and practices and other human activities and relationships that are found in the Bible or pertain to peoples mentioned in the Bible.&quot; Albright was not, however, a biblical literalist; in his &quot;Yahweh and the Gods of Canaan&quot;, for example, he argued that Yahwism and ancient Caananite religion had a reciprocal relationship, in which &quot;both gained much in the exchange which set in about the tenth century and continued until the fifth century B.C&quot;.

Although primarily a biblical archaeologist, Albright was a polymath who made contributions in almost every field of Near Eastern studies: an example of his range is a 1953 paper, &quot;New Light from Egypt on the Chronology and History of Israel and Judah&quot;, in which he established that Egyptian pharaoh Shoshenq I—the Biblical Shishaq—came to power somewhere between 945 and 940 BC.

A prolific author, his works in addition to &quot;Yahweh and the Gods of Canaan&quot;, include &quot;The Archaeology of Palestine: From the Stone Age to Christianity&quot;, and &quot;The Biblical Period from Abraham to Ezra&quot;. He also edited the Anchor Bible volumes on Jeremiah, Matthew, and Revelation.

Throughout his life Albright was honored with awards, honorary doctorates, and medals, and was proclaimed &quot;Yakir Yerushalayim&quot; (Worthy Citizen of Jerusalem)—the first time that title had been awarded to a non-Jew. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1929. He was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1955 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1956. After his death on September 19, 1971, his legacy continued through the many scholars inspired by his work, who specialized in the fields pioneered by Albright. The American School of Oriental Research, Jerusalem, was renamed the Albright Institute of Archaeological Research, in honor of Albright&#x27;s archeological achievements.

==Historical research and hypotheses==
From the 1930s until his death, he was the dean of biblical archaeologists and the acknowledged founder of the biblical archaeology movement. Coming from his background in German biblical criticism of the historicity of the biblical accounts, Albright, through his seminal work in archaeology (and his development of the standard pottery typology for Palestine and the Holy Land) concluded that the biblical accounts of Israelite history were, contrary to the dominant German biblical criticism of the day, largely accurate. This area remains widely contested among scholars. Albright&#x27;s student George Ernest Wright inherited his leadership of the biblical archaeology movement, contributing definitive work at Shechem and Gezer. Albright inspired, trained and worked with the first generation of world-class Israeli archaeologists, who have carried on his work, and maintained his perspective.

Other students such as Joseph Fitzmyer, Frank Moore Cross, Raymond E. Brown, and David Noel Freedman, became international leaders in the study of the Bible and the ancient Near East, including Northwest Semitic epigraphy and paleography. John Bright, Cyrus H. McCormick Professor of Hebrew and Old Testament Interpretation at Union Seminary in Richmond (PhD, Johns Hopkins, 1940), went on to become &quot;the first distinguished American historian of the Old Testament&quot; and &quot;arguably the most influential scholar of the Albright school&quot;, owing to his &quot;distinctly American commonsense flavor, similar to that of W[illiam] James&quot;. Thus Albright and his students influenced a broad swath of American higher education from the 1940s through the 1970s, after which revisionist scholars such as T. L. Thompson, John Van Seters, Niels Peter Lemche, and Philip R. Davies developed and advanced a minimalist critique of Albright&#x27;s view that archaeology supports the broad outlines of the history of Israel as presented in the Bible. Like other academic polymaths (Edmund Husserl in and Max Weber in the fields of sociology and the sociology of religion), Albright created and advanced the discipline of biblical archaeology, which is now taught at universities worldwide and has exponents across national, cultural, and religious lines.

==Influence and legacy==
Albright&#x27;s publication in the &quot;Annual of the American Schools of Oriental Research&quot;, 1932, of his excavations of Tell Beit Mirsim, and descriptions of the Bronze Age and Iron Age layers at the site in 1938 and 1943, marked a major contribution to the dating of sites based on ceramic typologies, which is still in use. &quot;With this work, Albright made Israeli archaeology into a science, instead of what it had formerly been: a digging in which the details are more or less well-described in an indifferent chronological framework which is as general as possible and often wildly wrong&quot;.

As editor of the &quot;Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research&quot; from 1931 to 1968, Albright influenced biblical scholarship and Palestinian archaeology. Albright advocated &quot;biblical archaeology&quot; in which the archaeologist&#x27;s task, according to fellow biblical archaeologist William G. Dever, is &quot;to illuminate, to understand, and, in their greatest excesses, to &#x27;prove&#x27; the Bible.&quot; Here, Albright&#x27;s American Methodist upbringing was clearly apparent. He insisted, for example, that &quot;as a whole, the picture in Genesis is historical, and there is no reason to doubt the general accuracy of the biographical details&quot; (i.e., of figures such as Abraham). Similarly he claimed that archaeology had proved the essential historicity of the Book of Exodus, and the conquest of Canaan as described in the Book of Joshua and the Book of Judges.

In the years since his death, Albright&#x27;s methods and conclusions have been increasingly questioned. In 1993, William G. Dever wrote that: [Albright&#x27;s] central theses have all been overturned, partly by further advances in Biblical criticism, but mostly by the continuing archaeological research of younger Americans and Israelis to whom he himself gave encouragement and momentum... The irony is that, in the long run, it will have been the newer &#x27;secular&#x27; archaeology that contributed the most to Biblical studies, &quot;not&quot; &#x27;Biblical archaeology.&#x27;

Biblical scholar Thomas L. Thompson wrote that by 2002 the methods of &quot;biblical archaeology&quot; had also become outmoded:Wright and Albright&#x27;s] historical interpretation can make no claim to be objective, proceeding as it does from a methodology which distorts its data by selectivity which is hardly representative, which ignores the enormous lack of data for the history of the early second millennium, and which wilfully establishes hypotheses on the basis of unexamined biblical texts, to be proven by such (for this period) meaningless mathematical criteria as the &quot;balance of probability&quot; ...

<doc id="210164" wikidata="Q303553" url="?curid=210164" title="Alphaeus Philemon Cole">
<text>Alphaeus Philemon Cole (July 12, 1876 – November 25, 1988) was an American artist, engraver, etcher and supercentenarian. He was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, the son of noted wood-engraver Timothy Cole. Until his death, at age 112 years and 136 days, Alphaeus had been the world&#x27;s oldest verified living man and the oldest living person in the United States.

==Biography==
Cole studied art first under Isaac Craig, in Italy, then in Paris from 1892 to 1901 with Jean Paul Laurens and Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant at the Académie Julian, and later at the École des Beaux-Arts. In the mid-1890s, he began to produce many vibrant works, mostly various still lifes and portraits. His painting of Dante was exhibited in the 1900 Paris Salon, and more artwork was displayed at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York.

Cole moved to England and married sculptor Margaret Ward Walmsley in 1903. He began to venture into the fields of wood/steel engraving and etching, but these works sold less than his portraits. He contributed several drawings to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. They moved again, to the United States, in 1911. In 1918, Cole became a member of the Salmagundi Club, the nation&#x27;s oldest professional art club. From 1924 to 1931, he taught portrait and still life classes at Cooper Union. He was elected to the National Academy of Design in 1930. He was the president of the New York Water Color Club from 1931 to 1941. In the 1940s, Cole worked as a judge of paintings in Max Pochapin&#x27;s Manhattan Hall of Art, a merchandising art gallery, which was a revolutionary idea at the time. From 1952 to 1953, he was president of Allied Artists of America. His first wife died in 1961, and Cole married Anita Rio (born 1873), a singer, and the widow of painter Eugene Higgins, in 1962. She died in 1971.

Cole actively painted and exhibited up to the age of 103. He died at New York&#x27;s Chelsea Hotel, where he had lived for 35 years. Cole&#x27;s work is in the permanent collections of London&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery and the Brooklyn Museum, and his papers are stored at the Smithsonian Institution.

Cole was subsequently verified as having been the oldest living man following the death of 111-year-old Norwegian skier Herman Smith-Johannsen, on January 5, 1987. He was also the oldest living person in the United States for seven months after the death of 112-year-old Elzona Maxey on April 25, 1988.

He died in New York City, aged 112 years and 136 days.

<text>Arthroscopy (also called arthroscopic or keyhole surgery) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure on a joint in which an examination and sometimes treatment of damage is performed using an arthroscope, an endoscope that is inserted into the joint through a small incision. Arthroscopic procedures can be performed during ACL reconstruction.

The advantage over traditional open surgery is that the joint does not have to be opened up fully. For knee arthroscopy only two small incisions are made, one for the arthroscope and one for the surgical instruments to be used in the knee cavity. This reduces recovery time and may increase the rate of success due to less trauma to the connective tissue. It has gained popularity due to evidence of faster recovery times with less scarring, because of the smaller incisions. Irrigation fluid (most commonly &#x27;normal&#x27; saline) is used to distend the joint and make a surgical space.

The surgical instruments are smaller than traditional instruments. Surgeons view the joint area on a video monitor, and can diagnose and repair torn joint tissue, such as ligaments. It is technically possible to do an arthroscopic examination of almost every joint, but is most commonly used for the knee, shoulder, elbow, wrist, ankle, foot, and hip.
==Types==

===Knee===
Knee arthroscopy, or arthroscopic knee surgery, is a surgery that uses arthroscopic techniques.

It has, in many cases, replaced the classic open surgery (arthrotomy) that was performed in the past. Arthroscopic knee surgery is one of the most common orthopaedic procedures, performed approximately 2 million times worldwide each year. The procedures are more commonly performed to treat meniscus injury and to perform anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

While knee arthroscopy is commonly used for partial meniscectomy (trimming a torn meniscus) on middle aged to older adults with knee pain, the claimed positive results seem to lack scientific evidence. Many studies have shown the outcomes from knee arthroscopic surgery for osteoarthritis and degenerative meniscal tears are no better than the outcomes from placebo (fake) surgery or other treatments (such as exercise therapy).

During an average knee arthroscopy, a small fiberoptic camera (the arthroscope) is inserted into the joint through a small incision, about 4 mm (1/8 inch) width. More incisions might be performed in order to visually check other parts of the knee and to insert the miniature instruments that are used to perform surgical procedures.

====Knee osteoarthritis====
The BMJ Rapid Recommendations group makes a strong recommendation against arthroscopy for osteoarthritis on the basis that there is high quality evidence that there is no lasting benefit and less than 15% of people have a small short-term benefit. There are rare but serious adverse effects that can occur, including venous thromboembolism, infections, and nerve damage. The BMJ Rapid Recommendation includes infographics and shared decision-making tools to facilitate a conversation between doctors and patients about the risks and benefits of arthroscopic surgery.

Two major trials of arthroscopic surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee found no benefit for these surgeries. Even though randomized control trials have demonstrated this to be a procedure which involves the risks of surgery with questionable or no demonstrable long-term benefit, insurance companies (government and private) world-wide have generally felt obliged to continue funding it. An exception is Germany, where funding has been removed for the indication of knee osteoarthritis. It is claimed that German surgeons have continued to perform knee arthroscopy and instead claim rebates on the basis of a sub-diagnosis, such as meniscal tear.

A 2017 meta-analysis confirmed that there is only a very small and usually unimportant reduction in pain and improvement in function at 3 months (e.g. an average pain reduction of approximately 5 on a scale from 0 to 100). A separate review found that most people would consider a reduction in pain of approximately 12 on the same 0 to 100 scale important—suggesting that for most people, the pain reduction at 3 months is not important. Arthroscopy did not reduce pain or improve function or quality of life at one year. There are important adverse effects.

====Meniscal tears====
One of the primary reasons for performing arthroscopies is to repair or trim a painful and torn or damaged meniscus. The technical terms for the surgery is arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM). Arthroscopic surgery, however, does not appear to result in benefits to adults when performed for knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis who have a meniscal tear. This may be due to the fact that a torn meniscus may often not cause pain and symptoms, which may be caused by the osteoarthritis alone. Some groups have made a strong recommendation against arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in nearly all patients, stating that the only group of patients who may—or may not—benefit are those with a true locked knee. Professional knee societies, however, highlight other symptoms and related factors they believe are important, and continue to support limited use of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in carefully selected patients.

===Hip===

Hip arthroscopy was initially used for the diagnosis of unexplained hip pain, but is now widely used in the treatment of conditions both in and outside the hip joint. The most common indication currently is for the treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and its associated pathologies. Hip conditions that may be treated arthroscopically also includes labral tears, loose / foreign body removal, hip washout (for infection) or biopsy, chondral (cartilage) lesions, osteochondritis dissecans, ligamentum teres injuries (and reconstruction), Iliopsoas tendinopathy (or &#x27;snapping psoas&#x27;), trochanteric pain syndrome, snapping iliotibial band, osteoarthritis (controversial), sciatic nerve compression (piriformis syndrome), ischiofemoral impingement and direct assessment of hip replacement.

Hip arthroscopy is a widely adopted treatment for a range of conditions, including labral tears, femoroacetabular impingement, osteochondritis dissecans.

===Shoulder===
Arthroscopy is commonly used for treatment of diseases of the shoulder including subacromial impingement, acromioclavicular osteoarthritis, rotator cuff tears, frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis), chronic tendonitis, removal of loose bodies and partial tears of the long biceps tendon, SLAP lesions and shoulder instability. The most common indications include subacromial decompression, bankarts lesion repair and rotator cuff repair. All these procedures were done by opening the joint through big incisions before the advent of arthroscopy.
Arthroscopic shoulder surgeries have gained momentum in the past decade. &quot;Keyhole surgery&quot; of the shoulder as it is popularly known has reduced inpatient time and rehabilitation requirements and is often a daycare procedure.

=== Wrist ===
Arthroscopy of the wrist is used to investigate and treat symptoms of repetitive strain injury, fractures of the wrist and torn or damaged ligaments. It can also be used to ascertain joint damage caused by wrist osteoarthritis.

===Spine===
Many invasive spine procedures involve the removal of bone, muscle, and ligaments to access and treat problematic areas. In some cases, thoracic (mid-spine) conditions require a surgeon to access the problem area through the rib cage, dramatically lengthening recovery time.

Arthroscopic procedures (also endoscopic spinal procedures) allow access to and treatment of spinal conditions with minimal damage to surrounding tissues. Recovery times are greatly reduced due to the relatively small size of incisions, and many patients are treated as outpatients. Recovery rates and times vary according to condition severity and the patient&#x27;s overall health.

Arthroscopic procedures treat
* Spinal disc herniation and degenerative discs
* spinal deformity
* tumors
* general spine trauma

===Temporomandibular joint===
Arthroscopy of the temporomandibular joint is sometimes used as either a diagnostic procedure for symptoms and signs related to these joints, or as a therapeutic measure in conditions like temporomandibular joint dysfunction. TMJ arthroscopy can be a purely diagnostic procedure, or it can have its own beneficial effects which may result from washing out of the joint during the procedure, thought to remove debris and inflammatory mediators, and may enable a displaced disc to return to its correct position. Arthroscopy is also used to visualize the inside of the joint during certain surgical procedures involving the articular disc or the articular surfaces, similar to laparoscopy. Examples include release of adhesions (e.g., by blunt dissection or with a laser) or release of the disc. Biopsies or disc reduction can also be carried out during arthroscopy. It is carried out under general anesthetic.

== History ==
Professor Kenji Takagi in Tokyo has traditionally been credited with performing the first arthroscopic examination of a knee joint, in 1919. He used a 7.3 mm cystoscope for his first arthroscopies. The Danish physician Severin Nordentoft reported on arthroscopies of the knee joint in 1912 at the Proceedings of the 41st Congress of the German Society of Surgeons at Berlin. He called the procedure (in Latin) &quot;arthroscopia genu&quot;, and used sterile saline or boric acid solution as his optic media, and entering the joint by a portal on the outer border of the patella. It is not clear if these examinations were of deceased or of living patients.

Pioneering work began as early as the 1920s with the work of Eugen Bircher. He published several papers in the 1920s about his use of arthroscopy of the knee for diagnostic purposes. After diagnosing torn tissue, he used open surgery to remove or repair the damaged tissue. Initially, he used an electric Jacobaeus thoracolaparoscope for his diagnostic procedures, which produced a dim view of the joint. Later, he developed a double-contrast approach to improve visibility. He gave up endoscopy in 1930, and his work was largely neglected for several decades.

While he is often considered the inventor of arthroscopy of the knee, the Japanese surgeon Masaki Watanabe, MD, receives primary credit for using arthroscopy for interventional surgery. Watanabe was inspired by the work and teaching of Dr Richard O&#x27;Connor. Later, Dr. Heshmat Shahriaree began experimenting with ways to excise fragments of menisci.

The first operating arthroscope was designed by them, and they worked together to produce the first high-quality color intraarticular photography. The field benefited significantly from technological advances, particularly advances in flexible fiber optics during the 1970s and 1980s.

Canadian doctor Robert Jackson is credited with bringing the procedure to the Western world. In 1964, Jackson was in Tokyo completing a one-year fellowship and serving as a physician for the Canadian Olympic team. While there, he spent time at the clinic of Watanabe learning the thirty year old procedure that had only been used to investigate arthritis in the elderly. Jackson returned to Toronto where he continued to practice the technique, eventually becoming &quot;the world&#x27;s foremost expert on arthroscopy&quot;.

According to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Jackson&#x27;s particular genius was to recognize a wider application for the procedure than Watanabe ever did.&quot; Jackson realized the technique could be used for young, athletic patients that had suffered injuries. Torn knee cartilage or ligaments previously would require an arthrotomy procedure and might mean a year or more of rehab or the end of a career. Jackson believed the less invasive procedure with its smaller incisions would be able to save the career of injured athletes. While many were skeptical at first, Jackson&#x27;s efforts to develop, teach and popularize the procedure helped to prolong the careers of athletes such as Bobby Orr, Willis Reed, Joan Benoit and Mary Lou Retton. For this, Jackson was named one of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s forty most impactful people in sport&#x27;s history, coming in at #37, and the only doctor on the list.

== Complications ==
Arthroscopy is considered a low-risk procedure with a very low rates of serious complications. Commonly, irrigation fluid may leak (extravasates) into the surrounding soft tissue, causing edema which is generally a temporary phenomenon, taking anywhere from 7–15 days to completely settle. Rarely, this fluid may be the cause of a serious complication, compartment syndrome. However, postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis (PAGCL) is a rare complication of arthroscopic surgery and involves chondrolysis wherein the articular cartilage of the shoulder undergoes rapid, degenerative changes shortly after arthroscopic surgery.

<doc id="210170" wikidata="Q3390930" url="?curid=210170" title="A Plea for Captain John Brown">
<text>&quot;A Plea for Captain John Brown&quot; is an essay by Henry David Thoreau, based on a speech he first delivered to an audience at Concord, Massachusetts, on October 30, 1859, two weeks after John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry, and repeated several times before Brown&#x27;s execution on December 2, 1859. It was later published as a part of &quot;Echoes of Harper&#x27;s Ferry&quot; in 1860.

==Context==

John Brown, a radical abolitionist, and 21 other men seized the Federal armory at Harper&#x27;s Ferry, the holding place for approximately 100,000 rifles and muskets, hoping to arm slaves and create a violent rebellion against the South. After 36 hours, the revolt was suppressed by Federal forces led by Robert E. Lee, and Brown was jailed. The raid resulted in thirteen deaths: twelve rebels and one U.S. Marine. 

Ralph Waldo Emerson, in a memorial essay written after Thoreau&#x27;s death, describes the first presentation of this essay:Before the first friendly word had been spoken for Captain John Brown, he [Thoreau] sent notices to most houses in Concord, that he would speak in a public ball on the condition and character of John Brown, on Sunday evening, and invited all people to come. The Republican Committee, the Abolitionist Committee, sent him word that it was premature and not advisable. He replied,—“I did not send to you for advice, but to announce that I am to speak.” The hall was filled at an early hour by people of all parties, and his earnest eulogy of the hero was heard by all respectfully, by many with a sympathy that surprised themselves.

Brown himself, after being found guilty of murder, treason, and inciting a slave insurrection, was hanged on December 2, 1859. Although largely called a failure at the time, the raid and Brown&#x27;s subsequent execution impelled the American Civil War.

== Synopsis ==

Thoreau&#x27;s essay espoused John Brown and his fight for abolition. In opposition with popular opinion of the time – Thoreau vehemently refuted the claims of newspapers and his fellow countrymen who characterized Brown as foolish and insane – he painted a portrait of a peerless man whose embrace of a cause was unparalleled. Brown&#x27;s commitment to justice and adherence to the United States Constitution forced him to fight state-sponsored injustice, one he was only affected by in spirit.

A unique man, Thoreau proclaimed in admiration, Brown was highly moral and humane. Independent, &quot;under the auspices of John Brown and nobody else&quot;, and direct of speech, Brown instilled fear, which he attributed to a lack of cause, into large groups of men who supported slavery. Incomparable to man, Thoreau likens Brown&#x27;s execution – he states that he regards Brown as dead before his actual death – to Christ&#x27;s crucifixion at the hands of Pontius Pilate, with whom he compares the American government.

Thoreau vents at the scores of Americans who have voiced their displeasure and scorn for John Brown. The same people, Thoreau says, can&#x27;t relate to Brown because of their concrete stances and &quot;dead&quot; existences; they are truly not living, only a handful of men have lived. Thoreau also criticizes contemporary Christians, who say their prayers and then go to sleep aware of injustice but doing nothing to change it. Similarly, Thoreau states those who believe Brown threw his life away and died as a fool, are themselves fools. Brown gave his life for justice, not for material gains, and was completely sane, perhaps more so than any other human being. Rebutting the arguments based on the small number of rebels, Thoreau responds &quot;when were the good and the brave ever in a majority?&quot; Thoreau also points out the irony of &quot;The Liberator&quot;, an abolitionist newspaper, labeling Brown&#x27;s actions as misguided.

<text>Kandula is a famous war elephant mentioned in the Sinhala chronicle Mahavamsa.

According to the chronicle, when Dutugamunu of Sri Lanka (101–77 BC) was born, many items of value were said to have appeared spontaneously, which were found and brought in by various people as gifts to the newborn. Among them a fine elephant who was found by a fisherman named &quot;Kandula&quot;. The elephant was named for its finder and became the companion of Dutugamunu, serving as his mount during the wars that led to the unification of Sri Lanka. The climactic duel between the Indian king Ellalan and Dutugemunu is said to have occurred near Anuradhapura where the two kings mounted on elephants; Dutugemunu mounting Kandula and Elara mounting Maha Pambata. King Ealara is said to have been slain in this elephant-mounted duel.

An Asian elephant born in 2001 at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. was named after Kandula. He is the first Asian elephant to be conceived by artificial insemination and the 5th AI birth ever utilizing a method developed by a team of German veterinarians.

The mascot of the Sri Lanka Light Infantry Regiment is also named Kandula, after the royal elephant of Dutugamunu.

<text>St. Martin&#x27;s Cathedral, Utrecht, or Dom Church (), is a Gothic church dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours, which was the cathedral of the Diocese of Utrecht during the Middle Ages. It is the country&#x27;s only pre-Reformation cathedral, but has been a Protestant church since 1580.

It was once the Netherlands&#x27; largest church, but the nave collapsed in a storm in 1674 and has never been rebuilt, leaving the tower isolated from the east end.

The building is the one church in the Netherlands that closely resembles the style of classic Gothic architecture as developed in France. All other Gothic churches in the Netherlands belong to one of the many regional variants. Unlike most of its French predecessors, the building has only one tower, the Dom Tower, which is the hallmark of the city.

In the joint 2021, 2022 session of the World Heritage Committee the cathedral, Dom Tower, and the Domplein was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the Lower Germanic Limes, for its Roman archaeological remains within the square.

==History==
The first chapel in Utrecht was founded around 630 AD by Frankish clergy under the patronage of the Merovingian kings but was destroyed during an attack of the Frisians on Utrecht shortly thereafter. The site of this first chapel within Utrecht is unknown. Saint Willibrord (died 739), the Apostle to the Frisians, established a second chapel devoted to Saint Martin on (or close to) the site of the current building. This church was destroyed by the Normans in the 9th century during one of their many raids on Utrecht, but was reconstructed by Bishop Balderic in the 10th century. During this period St. Martin&#x27;s came to be the principal church of Utrecht, see of the bishop. The church had its own small territorial close (known as an &quot;immunity&quot;) and was led by a cathedral chapter of canons, who generally belonged to the nobility.

The church was repeatedly destroyed by fires and then rebuilt. A Romanesque style church was built by Bishop Adalbold and consecrated in 1023. It is thought to have been the center of a cross-shaped conglomeration of five churches, called a &#x27;, built to commemorate Conrad II. This building, also known as Adalbold&#x27;s Dom, was partially destroyed in the fire of 1253 which ravaged much of Utrecht, leading Bishop Henry van Vianen to initiate the construction of the current Gothic structure in 1254. The construction of the Gothic cathedral continued into the 16th century. The first part to be built was the choir. The Dom Tower was started in 1321 and finished in 1382. After 1515, steadily diminishing financing prevented completion of this building project, of which an almost complete series of building accounts exists. In 1566, the &#x27; or Iconoclast Fury swept across much of the Low Countries, justified by the Calvinist belief that statues in a house of God were idolatrous images which must be destroyed. As a result, many of the ornaments on both the exterior and interior of the cathedral were destroyed.

In 1580 the Utrecht city government devolved the cathedral from the Diocese of Utrecht to local Calvinists. From then on Protestant services were held in the building with one brief exception, in 1672 and 1673, during the Franco-Dutch War, when Catholic Masses were again held in the cathedral. A year after the French retreat, the still unfinished and insufficiently supported nave collapsed on 1 August 1674 during a massive storm that caused a tornado. Over the subsequent centuries, much of the enormous building fell into further neglect. The pitiable state of the cathedral led to some small restoration activities in the nineteenth century, followed by major renovations in the early twentieth century with the aim of returning the cathedral to its original state. However, the nave was never rebuilt.

The Catholic Church remained strong within Utrecht following the Reformation but was legally obliged to worship discreetly in clandestine churches (&quot;&quot;). One of these churches, St. Gertrude&#x27;s, later became the principal cathedral of the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands.

The Catholic Church, during the 1853 reestablishment of the episcopal hierarchy in the Netherlands, designated the former St. Catherine&#x27;s Church of the Carmelites as the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht.

==Current-day church==
What remains of St. Martin&#x27;s today are the choir, the transept and the Dom Tower. The central nave of the cathedral which collapsed in the storm of 1674 is now a square with large trees, the &quot;&quot;. Stones in various colours indicate in the pavement the original outlines of the church. 
The cloister and a chapter house to the south, the latter of which is now an important hall of Utrecht University, are also still intact in their original form and standing. The Union of Utrecht, a founding document of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, was signed in the chapter house.

In 2004, 750 years after construction began, the collapsed parts were temporarily rebuilt in scaffolding material. The scaffolding was also blown down in a storm, like the original nave. In 2013, a project started to expose the cathedral&#x27;s archaeological artifacts.

Since 2019, the Dom tower has been undergoing major renovations. When the church spire was temporarily removed, between November 2021 and July 2022, the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft briefly became the church with the tallest tower in the Netherlands. The renovation works were completed in 2024 and the tower was officially opened with new lighting in november 2024.

==Burials and memorials in the Dom==
Utrecht was an important city in the western Holy Roman Empire and had particularly close links to the imperial Salian dynasty. In the early Middle Ages the Holy Roman Emperor was always an honorary canon of the cathedral. The Emperor Conrad II and the Emperor Henry V both died in Utrecht, in 1039 and 1125 respectively. Their bowels and hearts were interred in the cathedral. The modest &quot;Emperors&#x27; stones&quot; (&quot;keizerssteentjes&quot;) in the floor of the choir of the cathedral are a reminder of this fact.

The only medieval tomb of importance to remain relatively unscathed in the cathedral is that of the 14th-century Bishop Guy of Avesnes – the brother of John II, Count of Holland, Hainaut, and Zeeland.

There are many other beautifully carved burial slabs and memorials in the cathedral. Of particular note is the monumental cenotaph, which contained the heart of the 16th-century Bishop George van Egmond.

<text>Development economics is a branch of economics that deals with economic aspects of the development process in low- and middle- income countries. Its focus is not only on methods of promoting economic development, economic growth and structural change but also on improving the potential for the mass of the population, for example, through health, education and workplace conditions, whether through public or private channels.

Development economics involves the creation of theories and methods that aid in the determination of policies and practices and can be implemented at either the domestic or international level. This may involve restructuring market incentives or using mathematical methods such as intertemporal optimization for project analysis, or it may involve a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. Common topics include growth theory, poverty and inequality, human capital, and institutions.

Unlike in many other fields of economics, approaches in development economics may incorporate social and political factors to devise particular plans. Also unlike many other fields of economics, there is no consensus on what students should know. Different approaches may consider the factors that contribute to economic convergence or non-convergence across households, regions, and countries.

==Theories of development economics==

=== Mercantilism and physiocracy ===

The earliest Western theory of development economics was mercantilism, which developed in the 17th century, paralleling the rise of the nation state. Earlier theories had given little attention to development. For example, scholasticism, the dominant school of thought during medieval feudalism, emphasized reconciliation with Christian theology and ethics, rather than development. The 16th- and 17th-century School of Salamanca, credited as the earliest modern school of economics, likewise did not address development specifically.

Major European nations in the 17th and 18th centuries all adopted mercantilist ideals to varying degrees, the influence only ebbing with the 18th-century development of physiocrats in France and classical economics in Britain. Mercantilism held that a nation&#x27;s prosperity depended on its supply of capital, represented by bullion (gold, silver, and trade value) held by the state. It emphasised the maintenance of a high positive trade balance (maximising exports and minimising imports) as a means of accumulating this bullion. To achieve a positive trade balance, protectionist measures such as tariffs and subsidies to home industries were advocated. Mercantilist development theory also advocated colonialism.

Theorists most associated with mercantilism include Philipp von Hörnigk, who in his &quot;Austria Over All, If She Only Will&quot; of 1684 gave the only comprehensive statement of mercantilist theory, emphasizing production and an export-led economy. In France, mercantilist policy is most associated with 17th-century finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, whose policies proved influential in later American development.

Mercantilist ideas continue in the theories of economic nationalism and neomercantilism.

=== Economic nationalism ===
Following mercantilism was the related theory of economic nationalism, promulgated in the 19th century related to the development and industrialization of the United States and Germany, notably in the policies of the American System in America and the Zollverein (customs union) in Germany. A significant difference from mercantilism was the de-emphasis on colonies, in favor of a focus on domestic production.

The names most associated with 19th-century economic nationalism are the first United States Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, the German-American Friedrich List, and the American politician Henry Clay. Hamilton&#x27;s 1791 &quot;Report on Manufactures,&quot; his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, is the founding text of the American System, and drew from the mercantilist economies of Britain under Elizabeth I and France under Colbert. List&#x27;s 1841 &quot;Das Nationale System der Politischen Ökonomie&quot; (translated into English as The National System of Political Economy), which emphasized stages of growth. Hamilton professed that developing an industrialized economy was impossible without protectionism because import duties are necessary to shelter domestic &quot;infant industries&quot; until they could achieve economies of scale. Such theories proved influential in the United States, with much higher American average tariff rates on manufactured products between 1824 and the WWII period than most other countries, Nationalist policies, including protectionism, were pursued by Clay, and later by Abraham Lincoln, under the influence of economist Henry Charles Carey.

Forms of economic nationalism and neomercantilism have also been key in Japan&#x27;s development in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the more recent development of the Four Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore), and, most significantly, China.

Following Brexit and the 2016 United States presidential election, some experts have argued a new kind of &quot;self-seeking capitalism&quot; popularly known as could have a considerable impact on cross-border investment flows and long-term capital allocation

=== Post-WWII theories ===
The origins of modern development economics are often traced to the need for, and likely problems with the industrialization of eastern Europe in the aftermath of World War II. The key authors are Paul Rosenstein-Rodan, Kurt Mandelbaum, Ragnar Nurkse, and Sir Hans Wolfgang Singer. Only after the war did economists turn their concerns towards Asia, Africa, and Latin America. At the heart of these studies, by authors such as Simon Kuznets and W. Arthur Lewis was an analysis of not only economic growth but also structural transformation.

===Linear-stages-of-growth model===

An early theory of development economics, the linear-stages-of-growth model was first formulated in the 1950s by W. W. Rostow in &quot;The Stages of Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto,&quot; following work of Marx and List. This theory modifies Marx&#x27;s stages theory of development and focuses on the accelerated accumulation of capital, through the utilization of both domestic and international savings as a means of spurring investment, as the primary means of promoting economic growth and, thus, development. The linear-stages-of-growth model posits that there are a series of five consecutive stages of development that all countries must go through during the process of development. These stages are &quot;the traditional society, the pre-conditions for take-off, the take-off, the drive to maturity, and the age of high mass-consumption&quot; Simple versions of the Harrod–Domar model provide a mathematical illustration of the argument that improved capital investment leads to greater economic growth.

Such theories have been criticized for not recognizing that, while necessary, capital accumulation is not a sufficient condition for development. That is to say that this early and simplistic theory failed to account for political, social, and institutional obstacles to development. Furthermore, this theory was developed in the early years of the Cold War and was largely derived from the successes of the Marshall Plan. This has led to the major criticism that the theory assumes that the conditions found in developing countries are the same as those found in post-WWII Europe.

===Structural-change theory===

Structural-change theory deals with policies focused on changing the economic structures of developing countries from being composed primarily of subsistence agricultural practices to being a &quot;more modern, more urbanized, and more industrially diverse manufacturing and service economy.&quot; There are two major forms of structural-change theory: W. Lewis&#x27; &quot;two-sector surplus model&quot;, which views agrarian societies as consisting of large amounts of surplus labor which can be utilized to spur the development of an urbanized industrial sector, and Hollis Chenery&#x27;s &quot;patterns of development&quot; approach, which holds that different countries become wealthy via different trajectories. The &quot;pattern&quot; that a particular country will follow, in this framework, depends on its size and resources, and potentially other factors including its current income level and comparative advantages relative to other nations. Empirical analysis in this framework studies the &quot;sequential process through which the economic, industrial, and institutional structure of an underdeveloped economy is transformed over time to permit new industries to replace traditional agriculture as the engine of economic growth.&quot;

Structural-change approaches to development economics have faced criticism for their emphasis on urban development at the expense of rural development which can lead to a substantial rise in inequality between internal regions of a country. The two-sector surplus model, which was developed in the 1950s, has been further criticized for its underlying assumption that predominantly agrarian societies suffer from a surplus of labor. Actual empirical studies have shown that such labor surpluses are only seasonal and drawing such labor to urban areas can result in a collapse of the agricultural sector. The patterns of development approach has been criticized for lacking a theoretical framework.

===International dependence theory===
International dependence theories gained prominence in the 1970s as a reaction to the failure of earlier theories to lead to widespread successes in international development. Unlike earlier theories, international dependence theories have their origins in developing countries and view obstacles to development as being primarily external in nature, rather than internal. These theories view developing countries as being economically and politically dependent on more powerful, developed countries that have an interest in maintaining their dominant position. There are three different, major formulations of international dependence theory: neocolonial dependence theory, the false-paradigm model, and the dualistic-dependence model. The first formulation of international dependence theory, neocolonial dependence theory, has its origins in Marxism and views the failure of many developing nations to undergo successful development as being the result of the historical development of the international capitalist system.

===Neoclassical theory===
First gaining prominence with the rise of several conservative governments in the developed world during the 1980s, neoclassical theories represent a radical shift away from International Dependence Theories. Neoclassical theories argue that governments should not intervene in the economy; in other words, these theories are claiming that an unobstructed free market is the best means of inducing rapid and successful development. Competitive free markets unrestrained by excessive government regulation are seen as being able to naturally ensure that the allocation of resources occurs with the greatest efficiency possible and that economic growth is raised and stabilized.

There are several different approaches within the realm of neoclassical theory, each with subtle, but important, differences in their views regarding the extent to which the market should be left unregulated. These different takes on neoclassical theory are the &quot;free market approach&quot;, &quot;public-choice theory&quot;, and the &quot;market-friendly approach&quot;. Of the three, both the free-market approach and public-choice theory contend that the market should be totally free, meaning that any intervention by the government is necessarily bad. Public-choice theory is arguably the more radical of the two with its view, closely associated with libertarianism, that governments themselves are rarely good and therefore should be as minimal as possible.

Academic economists have given varied policy advice to governments of developing countries. See for example, Economy of Chile (Arnold Harberger), Economic history of Taiwan (Sho-Chieh Tsiang). Anne Krueger noted in 1996 that success and failure of policy recommendations worldwide had not consistently been incorporated into prevailing academic writings on trade and development.

The market-friendly approach, unlike the other two, is a more recent development and is often associated with the World Bank. This approach still advocates free markets but recognizes that there are many imperfections in the markets of many developing nations and thus argues that some government intervention is an effective means of fixing such imperfections.

==Topics of research==
Development economics also includes topics such as third world debt, and the functions of such organisations as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. In fact, the majority of development economists are employed by, do consulting with, or receive funding from institutions like the IMF and the World Bank. Many such economists are interested in ways of promoting stable and sustainable growth in poor countries and areas, by promoting domestic self-reliance and education in some of the lowest income countries in the world. Where economic issues merge with social and political ones, it is referred to as development studies.

=== Geography and development ===
Economists Jeffrey D. Sachs, Andrew Mellinger, and John Gallup argue that a nation&#x27;s geographical location and topography are key determinants and predictors of its economic prosperity. Areas developed along the coast and near &quot;navigable waterways&quot; are far wealthier and more densely populated than those further inland. Furthermore, countries outside the tropic zones, which have more temperate climates, have also developed considerably more than those located within the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. These climates outside the tropic zones, described as &quot;temperate-near,&quot; hold roughly a quarter of the world&#x27;s population and produce more than half of the world&#x27;s GNP, yet account for only 8.4% of the world&#x27;s inhabited area. Understanding of these different geographies and climates is imperative, they argue, because future aid programs and policies to facilitate economic development must account for these differences.

===Economic development and ethnicity===
A growing body of research has been emerging among development economists since the very late 20th century focusing on interactions between ethnic diversity and economic development, particularly at the level of the nation-state. While most research looks at empirical economics at both the macro and the micro level, this field of study has a particularly heavy sociological approach. The more conservative branch of research focuses on tests for causality in the relationship between different levels of ethnic diversity and economic performance, while a smaller and more radical branch argues for the role of neoliberal economics in enhancing or causing ethnic conflict. Moreover, comparing these two theoretical approaches brings the issue of endogeneity (endogenicity) into questions. This remains a highly contested and uncertain field of research, as well as politically sensitive, largely due to its possible policy implications.

====The role of ethnicity in economic development====
Much discussion among researchers centers around defining and measuring two key but related variables: ethnicity and diversity. It is debated whether ethnicity should be defined by culture, language, or religion. While conflicts in Rwanda were largely along tribal lines, Nigeria&#x27;s string of conflicts is thought to be – at least to some degree – religiously based. Some have proposed that, as the saliency of these different ethnic variables tends to vary over time and across geography, research methodologies should vary according to the context. Somalia provides an interesting example. Due to the fact that about 85% of its population defined themselves as Somali, Somalia was considered to be a rather ethnically homogeneous nation. However, civil war caused ethnicity (or ethnic affiliation) to be redefined according to clan groups.

There is also much discussion in academia concerning the creation of an index for &quot;ethnic heterogeneity&quot;. Several indices have been proposed in order to model ethnic diversity (with regards to conflict). Easterly and Levine have proposed an ethno-linguistic fractionalization index defined as FRAC or ELF defined by:
:formula_1 
where &quot;si&quot; is size of group &quot;i&quot; as a percentage of total population. The ELF index is a measure of the probability that two randomly chosen individuals belong to different ethno-linguistic groups. Other researchers have also applied this index to religious rather than ethno-linguistic groups. Though commonly used, Alesina and La Ferrara point out that the ELF index fails to account for the possibility that fewer large ethnic groups may result in greater inter-ethnic conflict than many small ethnic groups. More recently, researchers such as Montalvo and Reynal-Querol, have put forward the &quot;Q&quot; polarization index as a more appropriate measure of ethnic division. Based on a simplified adaptation of a polarization index developed by Esteban and Ray, the &quot;Q&quot; index is defined as 
:formula_2
where &quot;si&quot; once again represents the size of group &quot;i&quot; as a percentage of total population, and is intended to capture the social distance between existing ethnic groups within an area.

Early researchers, such as Jonathan Pool, considered a concept dating back to the account of the Tower of Babel: that linguistic unity may allow for higher levels of development. While pointing out obvious oversimplifications and the subjectivity of definitions and data collection, Pool suggested that we had yet to see a robust economy emerge from a nation with a high degree of linguistic diversity. In his research Pool used the &quot;size of the largest native-language community as a percentage of the population&quot; as his measure of linguistic diversity. Not much later, however, Horowitz pointed out that both highly diverse and highly homogeneous societies exhibit less conflict than those in between. Similarly, Collier and Hoeffler provided evidence that both highly homogenous and highly heterogeneous societies exhibit lower risk of civil war, while societies that are more polarized are at greater risk. As a matter of fact, their research suggests that a society with only two ethnic groups is about 50% more likely to experience civil war than either of the two extremes. Nonetheless, Mauro points out that ethno-linguistic fractionalization is positively correlated with corruption, which in turn is negatively correlated with economic growth. Moreover, in a study on economic growth in African countries, Easterly and Levine find that linguistic fractionalization plays a significant role in reducing national income growth and in explaining poor policies. In addition, empirical research in the U.S., at the municipal level, has revealed that ethnic fractionalization (based on race) may be correlated with poor fiscal management and lower investments in public goods. Finally, more recent research would propose that ethno-linguistic fractionalization is indeed negatively correlated with economic growth while more polarized societies exhibit greater public consumption, lower levels of investment and more frequent civil wars.

====Economic development and its impact on ethnic conflict====
Increasingly, attention is being drawn to the role of economics in &quot;spawning&quot; or &quot;cultivating&quot; ethnic conflict. Critics of earlier development theories, mentioned above, point out that &quot;ethnicity&quot; and ethnic conflict cannot be treated as exogenous variables. There is a body of literature that discusses how economic growth and development, particularly in the context of a globalizing world characterized by free trade, appears to be leading to the extinction and homogenization of languages. Manuel Castells asserts that the &quot;widespread destructuring of organizations, delegitimation of institutions, fading away of major social movements, and ephemeral cultural expressions&quot; which characterize globalization lead to a renewed search for meaning; one that is based on identity rather than on practices. Barber and Lewis argue that culturally-based movements of resistance have emerged as a reaction to the threat of modernization (perceived or actual) and neoliberal development.

On a different note, Chua suggests that ethnic conflict often results from the envy of the majority toward a wealthy minority which has benefited from trade in a neoliberal world. She argues that conflict is likely to erupt through political manipulation and the vilification of the minority. Prasch points out that, as economic growth often occurs in tandem with increased inequality, ethnic or religious organizations may be seen as both assistance and an outlet for the disadvantaged. However, empirical research by Piazza argues that economics and unequal development have little to do with social unrest in the form of terrorism. Rather, &quot;more diverse societies, in terms of ethnic and religious demography, and political systems with large, complex, multiparty systems were more likely to experience terrorism than were more homogeneous states with few or no parties at the national level&quot;.

====Recovery from conflict (civil war)====
Violent conflict and economic development are deeply intertwined. Paul Collier describes how poor countries are more prone to civil conflict. The conflict lowers incomes catching countries in a &quot;conflict trap.&quot; Violent conflict destroys physical capital (equipment and infrastructure), diverts valuable resources to military spending, discourages investment and disrupts exchange.

Recovery from civil conflict is very uncertain. Countries that maintain stability can experience a &quot;peace dividend,&quot; through the rapid re-accumulation of physical capital (investment flows back to the recovering country because of the high return). However, successful recovery depends on the quality of legal system and the protection of private property. Investment is more productive in countries with higher quality institutions. Firms that experienced a civil war were more sensitive to the quality of the legal system than similar firms that had never been exposed to conflict.

==Growth indicator controversy==
Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, real income, median income and disposable income are used by many developmental economists as an approximation of general national well-being. However, these measures are criticized as not measuring economic growth well enough, especially in countries where there is much economic activity that is not part of measured financial transactions (such as housekeeping and self-homebuilding), or where funding is not available for accurate measurements to be made publicly available for other economists to use in their studies (including private and institutional fraud, in some countries).

Even though per-capita GDP as measured can make economic well-being appear smaller than it really is in some developing countries, the discrepancy could be still bigger in a developed country where people may perform outside of financial transactions an even higher-value service than housekeeping or homebuilding as gifts or in their own households, such as counseling, lifestyle coaching, a more valuable home décor service, and time management. Even free choice can be considered to add value to lifestyles without necessarily increasing the financial transaction amounts.

More recent theories of Human Development have begun to see beyond purely financial measures of development, for example with measures such as medical care available, education, equality, and political freedom. One measure used is the Genuine Progress Indicator, which relates strongly to theories of distributive justice. Actual knowledge about what creates growth is largely unproven; however recent advances in econometrics and more accurate measurements in many countries are creating new knowledge by compensating for the effects of variables to determine probable causes out of merely correlational statistics.

==Recent developments==
Recent theories revolve around questions about what variables or inputs correlate or affect economic growth the most: elementary, secondary, or higher education, government policy stability, tariffs and subsidies, fair court systems, available infrastructure, availability of medical care, prenatal care and clean water, ease of entry and exit into trade, and equality of income distribution (for example, as indicated by the Gini coefficient), and how to advise governments about macroeconomic policies, which include all policies that affect the economy.
Education enables countries to adapt the latest technology and creates an environment for new innovations.

The cause of limited growth and divergence in economic growth lies in the high rate of acceleration of technological change by a small number of developed countries. These countries&#x27; acceleration of technology was due to increased incentive structures for mass education which in turn created a framework for the population to create and adapt new innovations and methods. Furthermore, the content of their education was composed of secular schooling that resulted in higher productivity levels and modern economic growth.

Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute also highlight the importance of using economic growth to improve the human condition, raising people out of poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Despite research showing almost no relation between growth and the achievement of the goals 2 to 7 and statistics showing that during periods of growth poverty levels in some cases have actually risen (e.g. Uganda grew by 2.5% annually between 2000 and 2003, yet poverty levels rose by 3.8%), researchers at the ODI suggest growth is necessary, but that it must be equitable. This concept of inclusive growth is shared even by key world leaders such as former Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who emphasises that:
:&quot;Sustained and equitable growth based on dynamic structural economic change is necessary for making substantial progress in reducing poverty. It also enables faster progress towards the other Millennium Development Goals. While economic growth is necessary, it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty.&quot;
Researchers at the ODI thus emphasise the need to ensure social protection is extended to allow universal access and that active policy measures are introduced to encourage the private sector to create new jobs as the economy grows (as opposed to jobless growth) and seek to employ people from disadvantaged groups.

<text>Brevet Colonel Sir Samuel Rickard Christophers (27 November 1873 – 19 February 1978) was a British protozoologist and medical entomologist specialising in mosquitoes.

==Education==
Christophers was born and raised in Liverpool, the son of Samuel Hunt Christophers and Mary Selina Christophers née Rickard and educated at the Liverpool Institute and University of Liverpool, graduating MB in 1896.

==Career==
In 1897, he took part in an Amazonian expedition and in 1898 went to Italy as part of the Malaria Commission, followed by a trip to Africa to study malaria. In 1901, the Malaria Commission moved to India.

On his return to England in 1902, he became a Lieutenant in the Indian Medical Service, moving back to India in 1904. In 1910 he was appointed the first Director of the Central Malaria Bureau, coordinating anti-malarial training and research throughout India. He spent World War I on anti-malaria duties in Iraq and in 1919 returned again to India as Director of the Central Research Institute at Kasauli in the foothills of the Himalayas.

Christophers was also an honorary physician to King George V from 1927 to 1930. He was awarded CIE in 1915, OBE in 1918 and knighted in 1931. He retired from the Indian Medical Service 27 November 1930 a Brevet Colonel. On his retirement in 1932–38, he joined the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine where he became Professor of Malaria Studies in the University of London and Leverhulme Fellow of the Medical Research Council in charge of the Malaria unit at the LSHTM. In 1944 Christophers was awarded the Manson Medal by the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene for his significant contribution to the fields of tropical medicine and hygiene.

== Personal life ==
Sir Philip Manson-Bahr, son-in-law of Sir Patrick Manson, described Sir Rickard Christophers in 1956:

&quot;&#x27;Christophers is known everywhere for his endearing qualities. He has a modest bearing and a curious hesitant manner accompanied by a cheerful giggle. He is the friend, philosopher and mentor of all keen young men of science&quot;&quot;&quot;&#x27;

He died at Broadstone in Dorset.

He had married Elise Emma Sherman in London in September 1902. She was the daughter of the owner of a coffee estate in India. Their first child, Elise Iseult, was born in June 1903 in Allahabad, India, and their son, Samuel Vagn, in December the following year in Madras. Lady Christophers died in England in 1962.

==Awards==
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1926. He was the sixteenth president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene from 1939 to 1943.

An expert on tropical medicines, Christophers studied many diseases, particularly malaria. His work on the research of this disease won him the Royal Society&#x27;s 1952 Buchanan Medal for &quot;outstanding research&quot; on the Anopheles mosquito that transmitted malaria. In his career he also contributed to the taxonomy of other parasites.

<doc id="210187" wikidata="Q727881" url="?curid=210187" title="Brennus">
<text>Brennus or Brennos is the name of two Gaulish chieftains, famous in ancient history:

* Brennus, chieftain of the Senones, a Gallic tribe originating from the modern areas of France known as Seine-et-Marne, Loiret, and Yonne; in 387 BC, in the Battle of the Allia, he led an army of Cisalpine Gauls in their attack on Rome.
* Another Brennus was one of the leaders of the army of Gauls who attempted to invade and settle in the Greek mainland in 278 BC. After a looting spree and after managing to pass Thermopylae by encircling the Greek army and forcing it to retreat he made his way to the rich treasury at Delphi but he was defeated by the re-assembled Greek army. Brennus was heavily injured at the battle of Delphi and committed suicide there.

The linguistic origins of the name are unclear, despite two theories linking it to Welsh words. Despite suggestions by scholars as early as the 12th century AD, including one by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, Brennus is not likely to share a common origin with the Welsh personal name &#x27; (or&#x27;) meaning &quot;crow&quot;; the similarity of the names is deemed to be superficial. Recurrence of the name Brennus makes it possible that it was a title rather than a proper name. However, despite assertions by some 19th-century scholars, Brennus and the modern Welsh word for &quot;king&quot;, &#x27; (earlier&#x27;) are not related. &quot;Brenin&quot; is instead derived from the Celtic , meaning &quot;(someone) pre-eminent, outstanding&quot;.

==Similar names==
Variants and adaptations of the name may include:
* Brân the Blessed, Welsh &quot;Bendigeidfran&quot;, a legendary giant leader of the British from the Mabinogion, the probable Welsh antecedent of Geoffrey&#x27;s Brennius;
* Brinno, chief of the Cananefates – a tribe from &quot;Germania Inferior&quot; – whose name was said by Tacitus to be that of &quot;a family of rebels&quot;;
* &quot;Brennius&quot;, listed in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; as brother of Bellinus, the latter a legendary king of the Britons; the two are said to have conquered Gaul and then Rome. Monmouth likely created Brennius as a composite of the two historical Gauls named Brennus. Geoffrey&#x27;s Brennius was mentioned by Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, in 1530, when the duke, while arguing in favor of the claims of the House of Tudor claims to imperial status, told Holy Roman Imperial ambassador Eustace Chapuys that Brennius had founded Bristol and conquered Rome.

==Allusions==
* The name was given to the French battleship &quot;Brennus&quot; (commissioned 1896).
* The name in its form &quot;Brennos&quot; is used for one of three fictitious &quot;barbarian&quot; chieftains in the 2008 video game &quot;Civilization Revolution&quot;.

<text>Open mapping theorem may refer to:

* Open mapping theorem (functional analysis) (also known as the Banach–Schauder theorem), states that a surjective continuous linear transformation of a Banach space &quot;X&quot; onto a Banach space &quot;Y&quot; is an open mapping
* Open mapping theorem (complex analysis), states that a non-constant holomorphic function on a connected open set in the complex plane is an open mapping
* Open mapping theorem (topological groups), states that a surjective continuous homomorphism of a locally compact Hausdorff group &quot;G&quot; onto a locally compact Hausdorff group &quot;H&quot; is an open mapping if &quot;G&quot; is &quot;σ&quot;-compact. Like the open mapping theorem in functional analysis, the proof in the setting of topological groups uses the Baire category theorem.

== See also ==
* In calculus, part of the inverse function theorem which states that a continuously differentiable function between Euclidean spaces whose derivative matrix is invertible at a point is an open mapping in a neighborhood of the point. More generally, if a mapping &quot;F&quot; : &quot;U&quot; → R&quot;m&quot; from an open set &quot;U&quot; ⊂ R&quot;n&quot; to R&quot;m&quot; is such that the Jacobian derivative &quot;dF&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is surjective at every point &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot;, then &quot;F&quot; is an open mapping.
* The invariance of domain theorem shows that certain mappings between subsets of R&quot;n&quot; are open.</text><links>

<text>Philo of Alexandria (; ; ; ), also called , was a Hellenistic Jewish philosopher who lived in Alexandria, in the Roman province of Egypt.

The only event in Philo&#x27;s life that can be decisively dated is his representation of the Alexandrian Jews in a delegation to the Roman emperor Caligula in 40 CE following civil strife between the Jewish and Greek communities of Alexandria.

Philo was a leading writer of the Hellenistic Jewish community in Alexandria, Egypt. He wrote expansively in Koine Greek on philosophy, politics, and religion in his time; specifically, he explored the connections between Greek Platonic philosophy and late Second Temple Judaism. For example, he maintained that the Greek-language Septuagint and the Jewish law still being developed by the rabbis of the period together serve as a blueprint for the pursuit of individual enlightenment.

Philo&#x27;s deployment of allegory to harmonize Jewish scripture, mainly the Torah, with Greek philosophy was the first documented of its kind, and thereby often misunderstood. Many critics of Philo assumed his allegorical perspective would lend credibility to the notion of legend over historicity. Philo often advocated a literal understanding of the Torah and the historicity of such described events, while at other times favoring allegorical readings.

==Life==
Philo&#x27;s dates of birth and death are unknown but can be judged by Philo&#x27;s description of himself as &quot;old&quot; when he was part of the delegation to Gaius Caligula in 38 CE. Jewish history professor Daniel R. Schwartz estimates his birth year as sometime between 15 and 10 BCE. Philo&#x27;s reference to an event under the reign of Emperor Claudius indicates that he died sometime between 45 and 50 CE. Philo also recounts that he visited the Second Temple in Jerusalem at least once in his lifetime.

=== Family ===
Although the names of his parents are unknown, it is known that Philo came from a family which was noble, honourable and wealthy. It was either his father or paternal grandfather who was granted Roman citizenship from Roman dictator Gaius Julius Caesar. Jerome wrote that Philo came &quot;de genere sacerdotum&quot; (from a priestly family). His ancestors and family had social ties and connections to the priesthood in Judea, the Hasmonean dynasty, the Herodian dynasty and the Julio-Claudian dynasty in Rome.

Philo had one brother, Alexander Lysimachus, who was the general tax administrator of customs in Alexandria. He accumulated an immense amount of wealth, becoming not only the richest man in that city but also in the entire Hellenistic world. Alexander was so rich that he gave a loan to the wife of king Herod Agrippa, as well as gold and silver to overlay the nine gates of the temple in Jerusalem. Due to his extreme wealth, Alexander was also influential in imperial Roman circles as a friend of emperor Claudius. Through Alexander, Philo had two nephews, Tiberius Julius Alexander and Marcus Julius Alexander. The latter was the first husband of the Herodian princess Berenice. Marcus died in 43 or 44. Some scholars identify Alexander Lysimachus as the Alexander referenced in the Book of Acts, who presided over the Sanhedrin trial of John and Peter.

=== Diplomacy ===
Philo lived in an era of increasing ethnic tension in Alexandria, exacerbated by the new strictures of imperial rule. Some expatriate Hellenes (Greeks) in Alexandria condemned the Jews for a supposed alliance with Rome, even as Rome was seeking to suppress Jewish national and cultural identity in the Roman province of Judaea. In &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, Josephus tells of Philo&#x27;s selection by the Alexandrian Jewish community as their principal representative before the Roman emperor Gaius Caligula. He says that Philo agreed to represent the Alexandrian Jews about the civil disorder that had developed between the Jews and the Greeks. Josephus also tells us that Philo was skilled in philosophy and that he was brother to the alabarch Alexander. According to Josephus, Philo and the larger Jewish community refused to treat the emperor as a god, to erect statues in honour of the emperor, and to build altars and temples to the emperor. Josephus says Philo believed that God actively supported this refusal.

Josephus&#x27; complete comments about Philo:
This event is also described in Book 2, Chapter 5 of Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Historia Ecclesiae&quot;

=== Education ===
Philo along with his brothers received a thorough education. They were educated in the Hellenistic culture of Alexandria and the culture of ancient Rome, to a degree in Ancient Egyptian religion and particularly in the traditions of Judaism, in the study of Jewish traditional literature and in Greek philosophy.

In his works, Philo shows extensive influence not only from philosophers such as Plato and the Stoics, but also poets and orators, especially Homer, Euripides, and Demosthenes. Philo&#x27;s largest philosophical influence was Plato, drawing heavily from the &quot;Timaeus&quot; and the &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, and also from the &quot;Phaedo&quot;, &quot;Theaetetus&quot;, &quot;Symposium&quot;, &quot;Republic&quot;, and &quot;Laws&quot;.

The extent of Philo&#x27;s knowledge of Hebrew, however, is debated. Philo was more fluent in Greek than in Hebrew and read the Jewish Scriptures chiefly from the Septuagint, a Koine Greek translation of Hebraic texts later compiled as the Hebrew Bible and the deuterocanonical books. His numerous etymologies of Hebrew names, which are along the lines of the etymologic &quot;midrash&quot; to Genesis and of the earlier rabbinism, although not modern Hebrew philology, suggest some familiarity. Philo offers for some names three or four etymologies, sometimes including the correct Hebrew root (e.g., as the origin of the name Jordan). However, his works do not display much understanding of Hebrew grammar, and they tend to follow the translation of the Septuagint more closely than the Hebrew version. .

Philo identified the angel of the Lord (in the singular) with the Logos. In the text attributed to Philo, he &quot;consistently uses as a designation for God&quot;. According to David B. Capes, &quot;the problem for this case, however, is that Christian scholars are responsible for copying and transmitting Philo&#x27;s words to later generations&quot;, and adds,
 James Royse concludes:

== Philosophy ==
Philo represents the apex of Jewish-Hellenistic syncretism. His work attempts to combine Plato and Moses into one philosophical system.

=== Allegorical interpretation ===

Philo bases his doctrines on the Hebrew Bible, which he considers the source and standard not only of religious truth but of all truth. Its pronouncements are the , , and (holy word, godly word, righteous word), uttered sometimes directly and sometimes through the mouth of a prophet, and especially through Moses, whom Philo considers the true medium of revelation. However, he distinguishes between the words uttered by God himself, such as the Ten Commandments, and the edicts of Moses (as the special laws).

Philo regards the Bible as the source not only of religious revelation but also of philosophical truth. By applying the Stoic mode of allegorical interpretation to the Hebrew Bible, he interpreted the stories of the first five books as elaborate metaphors and symbols to demonstrate that Greek philosophers&#x27; ideas had preceded them in the Bible: Heraclitus&#x27;s concept of binary oppositions, according to &quot;Who is the Heir of Divine Things?&quot; § 43 [i. 503]; and the conception of the wise man expounded by Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, in &quot;Every Good Man is Free&quot;, § 8 [ii. 454]. Philo did not reject the subjective experience of ancient Judaism; yet, he repeatedly explained that the Septuagint cannot be understood as a concrete, objective history. 
Philo&#x27;s allegorical interpretation of scripture allows him to grapple with morally disturbing events and impose a cohesive explanation of stories. Specifically, Philo interprets the characters of the Bible as aspects of the human being and the stories of the Bible as episodes from universal human experience. For example, Adam represents the mind and Eve, the senses. Noah represents tranquility, a stage of &quot;relative&quot;—incomplete but progressing—righteousness. According to Josephus, Philo was inspired mainly in this by Aristobulus of Alexandria and the Alexandrian school.

==== Numerology ====
Philo frequently engaged in Pythagorean-inspired numerology, explaining at length the importance of the first 10 numerals:

# One is God’s number and the basis for all numbers. 
# Two is the number of schism, that which has been created, and death. 
# Three is the number of the body (&quot;De Allegoriis Legum,&quot; i. 2 [i. 44]) or of the Divine Being in connection with its fundamental powers (&quot;De Sacrificiis Abelis et Caini,&quot; § 15 [i. 173]). 
# Four is potentially what ten is actually: the perfect number (&quot;De Opificio Mundi,&quot; §§ 15, 16 [i. 10, 11], etc.); but in an evil sense, four is the number of the passions, πάθη (&quot;De Congressu Quærendæ Eruditionis Gratia.&quot; § 17 [i. 532]). 
# Five is the number of the senses and of sensibility (&quot;De Opificio Mundi,&quot; § 20 [i. 14], etc.). 
# Six, the product of the masculine and feminine numbers 3×2 and in its parts equal to 3+3, is the symbol of the movement of organic beings (&quot;De Allegoriis Legum,&quot; i. 2 [i. 44]). 
# Seven has the most various attributes (&quot;De Opiticio Mundi,&quot; §§ 30-43 [i. 21 et seq.]; comp. I. G. Müller, &quot;Philo und die Weltschöpfung,&quot; 1841, p. 211). 
# Eight, the number of the cube, has many of the attributes determined by the Pythagoreans (&quot;Quæstiones in Genesin,&quot; iii. 49 [i. 223, Aucher]). 
# Nine is the number of strife, according to Gen. xiv. (&quot;De Congressu Qu. Eruditionis Gratia,&quot; § 17 [i. 532]). 
# Ten is the number of perfection (&quot;De Plantatione Noë,&quot; § 29 [i. 347]).

Philo also determines the values of the numbers 50, 70, 100, 12, and 120. There is also extensive symbolism of objects. Philo elaborates on the extensive symbolism of proper names, following the example of the Bible and the Midrash, to which he adds many new interpretations.

=== Theology===
Philo stated his theology both through the negation of opposing ideas and through detailed, positive explanations of the nature of God; he contrasted the nature of God with the nature of the physical world. Philo did not consider God similar to Heaven, the world, or man; he affirmed a transcendent God without physical features or emotional qualities resembling those of human beings. Following Plato, Philo equates matter to nothingness and sees its effect in fallacy, discord, damage, and decay of things. Only God&#x27;s existence is specific; no appropriate predicates can be conceived. To Philo, God exists beyond time and space and does not make special interventions into the world because God already encompasses the entire cosmos.

Philo also integrated select theology from the rabbinic tradition, including God&#x27;s transcendence, and humankind&#x27;s inability to behold an ineffable God. He argued that God has no attributes (ἁπλοῡς)—in consequence, no name (ἅρρητος)—and, therefore, that God cannot be perceived by man (ἀκατάληπτος). Furthermore, he posited that God cannot change (ἅτρεπτος): God is always the same (ἀΐδιος). God needs no other being (χρῄζει γὰρ οὐδενὸς τὸ παράπαν) for self-existence or the creation of material things, and God is self-sufficient (ἑαυτῷ ἱκανός). God can never perish (ἅφθαρτος), is self-existent (ὁ ὤν, τὸ ὄν), and has no relations with any other being (τὸ γὰρ ὄν, ᾗ ὄν ἐστιν, οὐχὶ τῶν πρός τι).

==== Anthropomorphism ====
Philo considered the anthropomorphism of the Bible to be an impiety that was incompatible with the Platonic conception of &quot;God in opposition to matter&quot;, instead interpreting the ascription to God of hands and feet, eyes and ears, tongue and windpipe, as allegories. In Philo&#x27;s interpretation, Hebrew scripture adapts itself to human conceptions, and so God is occasionally represented as a man for pedagogic reasons. The same holds true for God&#x27;s anthropopathic attributes. God, as such, is untouched by unreasonable emotions, as appears in Exodus 32:12, wherein Moses, torn by his feelings, perceives God alone to be calm. He is free from sorrow, pain, and other affections. But God is frequently represented as endowed with human emotions, and this serves to explain expressions referring to human repentance in the ancient Jewish context.

Similarly, God cannot exist or change in space. He has no &quot;where&quot; (πού, obtained by changing the accent in Genesis 3:9: &quot;Adam, where [ποῡ] art thou?&quot;), is not in any place. He is Himself the place; the dwelling-place of God means the same as God Himself, as in the Mishnah = &quot;God is&quot; (comp. Freudenthal, &quot;Hellenistische Studien,&quot; p. 73), corresponding to the tenet of Greek philosophy that the existence of all things is summed up in God. God as such is motionless, as the Bible indicates by the phrase &quot;God stands&quot;.

==== Divine attributes ====
Philo endeavored to find the Divine Being active and acting in the world, in agreement with Stoicism, yet his Platonic 
conception of Matter as evil required that he place God outside of the world in order to prevent God from having any contact with evil. Hence, he was obliged to separate from the Divine Being the activity displayed in the world and to transfer it to the divine powers, which accordingly were sometimes inherent in God and at other times exterior to God. In order to balance these Platonic and Stoic conceptions, Philo conceived of these divine attributes as types or patterns of actual things (&quot;archetypal ideas&quot;) in keeping with Plato, but also regarded them as the efficient causes that not only represent the types of things, but also produce and maintain them. Philo endeavored to harmonize this conception with the Bible by designating these powers as angels. Philo conceives the powers both as independent hypostases and as immanent attributes of a Divine Being.

In the same way, Philo contrasts the two divine attributes of goodness and power (ἄγαθότης and ἀρχή, δίναμις χαριστική and συγκολαστική) as expressed in the names of God; designating &quot;Yhwh&quot; as Goodness, Philo interpreted &quot;Elohim&quot; (LXX. Θεός) as designating the &quot;cosmic power&quot;; and as he considered the Creation the most important proof of divine goodness, he found the idea of goodness especially in Θεός.

==== Logos ====
Philo also treats the divine powers of God as a single independent being, or demiurge, which he designates &quot;Logos&quot;. Philo&#x27;s conception of the Logos is influenced by Heraclitus&#x27; conception of the &quot;dividing Logos&quot; (λόγος τομεύς), which calls the various objects into existence by the combination of contrasts (&quot;Quis Rerum Divinarum Heres Sit,&quot; § 43 [i. 503]), as well as the Stoic characterization of the Logos as the active and vivifying power.

But Philo followed the Platonic distinction between imperfect matter and perfect Form, and Philo&#x27;s conception of the Logos is directly related to the Middle Platonic view of God as unmoved and utterly transcendent; therefore, intermediary beings were necessary to bridge the enormous gap between God and the material world. The Logos was the highest of these intermediary beings and was called by Philo &quot;the first-born of God.&quot;

Philo also adapted Platonic elements in designating the Logos as the &quot;idea of ideas&quot; and the &quot;archetypal idea&quot;. Philo identified Plato&#x27;s Ideas with the demiurge&#x27;s thoughts. These thoughts make the contents of Logos; they were the seals for making sensual things during world creation. Logos resembles a book with creature paradigms. An Architect&#x27;s design before the construction of a city serves to Philo as another simile of Logos. Since creation, Logos binds things together. As the receptacle and holder of ideas, Logos is distinct from the material world. At the same time, Logos pervades the world, supporting it. This image of God is the type for all other things (the &quot;Archetypal Idea&quot; of Plato), a seal impressed upon things. The Logos is a kind of shadow cast by God, having the outlines but not the blinding light of the Divine Being. He calls the Logos &quot;second god [deuteros theos]&quot; the &quot;name of God,&quot; 

There are, in addition, Biblical elements: Philo connects his doctrine of the Logos with Scripture, first of all, based on Genesis 1:27, the relation of the Logos to God. He translates this passage as follows: &quot;He made man after the image of God,&quot; concluding from that place that an image of God existed. The Logos is also designated as &quot;high priest&quot; in reference to the exalted position that the high priest occupied after the Exile as the physical center of the Jews&#x27; relationship with God. The Logos, like the high priest, is the expiator of the Jews&#x27; sins and the mediator and advocate for humankind before, and envoy to, God: ἱκέτης, and παράκλητος. He puts human minds in order. The right reason is an infallible law, the source of any other laws. The angel blocking Balaam&#x27;s way in Numbers 22:22–35 is interpreted by Philo as a manifestation of the Logos, which acts as Balaam&#x27;s—or humankind&#x27;s—conscience. As such, the Logos becomes the aspect of the divine that operates in the world through whom the world is created and sustained.

Peter Schäfer argues that Philo&#x27;s Logos was derived from his understanding of the &quot;postbiblical Wisdom literature, in particular the Wisdom of Solomon&quot;. The Wisdom of Solomon is a Jewish work composed in Alexandria, Egypt, around the 1st century BCE, to bolster the faith of the Jewish community in a hostile Greek world. It is one of the seven Sapiential or Wisdom books included in the Septuagint.

=== Soul ===
The Logos has a special relation to humankind. Philo seems to look at humans as a trichotomy of nous (mind), (soul), and (body), which was common to the Hellenistic view of the mind-body relationship. In Philo&#x27;s writings, however, mind and spirit are used interchangeably. The soul is the type; man is the copy. The similarity is found in the mind (νοῦς) of humans. For the shaping of the nous, the individual has the Logos for a pattern to follow. The latter officiates here also as &quot;the divider&quot; (τομεύς), separating and uniting. The Logos, as &quot;interpreter,&quot; announces God&#x27;s designs to humankind, acting in this respect as prophet and priest. As the latter, the Logos softens punishments by making God&#x27;s merciful power stronger than the punitive. The Logos has a special mystic influence upon the human soul, illuminating it and nourishing it with higher spiritual food, like the manna, of which the most diminutive piece has the same vitality as the whole.

=== Ethics and politics ===
Philo&#x27;s ethics were strongly influenced by Pythagoreanism and Stoicism, preferring a morality of virtues without passions, such as lust/desire and anger, but with a &quot;common human sympathy&quot;. Commentators can also infer from his mission to Caligula that Philo was involved in politics. However, the nature of his political beliefs, especially his viewpoint on the Roman Empire, is a matter of debate.

Philo did suggest in his writings that a prudent man should withhold his genuine opinion about tyrants:

==Works==
The works of Philo are mostly allegorical interpretations of the Torah (known in the Hellenic world as the Pentateuch) but also include histories and comments on philosophy. Most of these were preserved in Greek by the Church Fathers; some survive only through an Armenian translation, and a smaller number survive in a Latin translation. The exact dates of writing and original organization plans are unknown for many of the texts attributed to Philo.

===Commentaries on the Pentateuch===
Most of Philo&#x27;s surviving work deals with the Torah (the first five books of the Bible). Within this corpus are three categories:
* &quot;Quaestiones&quot; (&quot;&quot;) – short verse-by-verse exposition: four books on the Book of Genesis and two on the Book of Exodus. All six books are preserved through an Armenian translation published by Jean-Baptiste Aucher in 1826. A comparison with surviving Greek and Latin fragments recommends the translation as literal and accurate as it goes, but it suggests that some original content is missing. There are thought to be twelve original books, six of which are about Genesis and six of which are about Exodus.
* &quot;Allegorical Commentary&quot; – a longer exegesis explaining esoteric meanings; the surviving text deals only with the Book of Genesis, with the notable omission of Genesis 1.
* &quot;Exposition of the Law&quot; – a more straightforward synthesis of topics in the Pentateuch, probably written for Gentiles as well as Jews.

Philo&#x27;s commentary on the Pentateuch is usually classified into three genres.

==== Quaestiones ====
The &quot;Quaestiones&quot; explain the Pentateuch catechetically, in the form of questions and answers (&quot;Zητήματα καὶ Λύσεις, Quæstiones et Solutiones&quot;). Only the following fragments have been preserved: abundant passages in Armenian – possibly the complete work – in explanation of Genesis and Exodus, an old Latin translation of a part of the &quot;Genesis&quot;, and fragments from the Greek text in Eusebius, in the &quot;Sacra Parallela&quot;, in the &quot;Catena&quot;, and also in Ambrosius. The explanation is confined chiefly to determining the literal sense, although Philo frequently refers to the allegorical sense as the higher.

==== Allegorical commentary of the Torah ====
Νόμων Ἱερῶν Ἀλληγορίαι, or &quot;Legum Allegoriæ&quot;, deals, so far as it has been preserved, with selected passages from Genesis. According to Philo&#x27;s original idea, the history of primal humanity is here considered a symbol of the religious and moral development of the human soul. This commentary included the following treatises:
#&quot;Legum allegoriae&quot;, books i.–iii., on Gen. ii. 1–iii. 1a, 8b–19 (on the original extent and contents of these three books and the probably more correct combination of i. and ii.)
#&quot;De cherubim&quot;, on Gen. iii. 24, iv. 1;
#&quot;De sacrificiis Abelis et Caini&quot;, on Gen. iv. 2–4;
#&quot;De eo quod deterius potiori insidiatur&quot;;
#&quot;De posteritate Caini&quot;, on Gen. iv. 16-25
#&quot;De gigantibus&quot;, on Gen. vi. 1–4;
#&quot;Quod Deus sit immutabilis&quot;, on Gen. vi. 4–12
#&quot;De Agricultura Noë&quot;, on Gen. ix. 20;
#&quot;De Plantatione&quot;, on Gen. ix. 20b;
#&quot;De Ebrietate&quot;, on Gen. ix. 21
#&quot;Resipuit; Noë, seu De Sobrietate&quot;, on Gen. ix. 24–27;
#&quot;De Confusione Linguarum&quot;, on Gen. xi. 1–9;
#&quot;De Migratione Abrahami&quot;, on Gen. xii. 1–6;
#&quot;Quis Rerum Divinarum Heres Sit&quot;, on Gen. xv. 2–18;
#&quot;De Congressu Quærendæ Eruditionis Gratia&quot;, on Gen. xvi. 1–6;
#&quot;De Profugis&quot;, on Gen. xvi. 6–14;
#&quot;De Mutatione Nominum&quot;, on Gen. xvii, 1–22;
#&quot;De Somniis&quot;, book i., on Gen. xxviii. 12 et seq., xxxi. 11 et seq. (Jacob&#x27;s dreams); &quot;De Somniis&quot;, book ii., on Gen. xxxvii. 40 et seq. (the dreams of Joseph, of the cupbearer, the baker, and Pharaoh). Philo&#x27;s three other books on dreams have been lost. The first of these (on the dreams of Abimelech and Laban) preceded the present book i., and discussed the dreams in which God Himself spoke with the dreamers, this fitting in very well with Gen. xx. 3.

==== Exposition of the Law ====

Philo wrote a systematic work on Moses and his laws, which is usually prefaced by the treatise &quot;De Opificio Mundi&quot;. The Creation is, according to Philo, the basis for the Mosaic legislation, which is in complete harmony with nature (&quot;De Opificio Mundi&quot;, § 1 [i. 1]). The exposition of the Law then follows in two sections. First come the biographies of the men who antedated the several written laws of the Torah, as Enos, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. These were the Patriarchs, who were the living impersonations of the active law of virtue before there were any written laws.

Then, the laws are discussed in detail: first, the chief ten commandments (the Decalogue), and then the precepts in amplification of each law. The work is divided into the following treatises: 
#&quot;De Opificio Mundi&quot; (comp. Siegfried in &quot;Zeitschrift für Wissenschaftliche Theologie&quot;, 1874, pp. 562–565; L Cohn&#x27;s important separate edition of this treatise, Breslau, 1889, preceded the edition of the same in &quot;Philonis Alexandrini&quot;, etc., 1896, i.).
#&quot;De Abrahamo&quot;, on Abraham, the representative of the virtue acquired by learning. The lives of Isaac and Jacob have been lost. The three patriarchs were intended as types of the ideal cosmopolitan condition of the world.
#&quot;De Josepho&quot;, the life of Joseph, intended to show how the wise man must act in the actually existing state.
#&quot;De Vita Mosis&quot;, books i.-iii.; Schürer, l.c. p. 523, combines the three books into two; but, as Massebieau shows (l.c. pp. 42 et seq.), a passage, though hardly an entire book, is missing at the end of the present second book (Wendland, in &quot;Hermes&quot;, xxxi. 440). Schürer (l.c. pp. 515, 524) excludes this work here, although he admits that from a literary point of view, it fits into this group, but he considers it foreign to the work in general, since Moses, unlike the Patriarchs, can not be conceived as a universally valid type of moral action, and can not be described as such. The latter point may be admitted. However, the question remains whether it is necessary to consider the matter in this light. It seems most natural to preface the discussion of the law with the biography of the legislator. In contrast, the transition from Joseph to the legislation, from the statesman who has nothing to do with the divine laws to the discussion of these laws themselves, is forced and abrupt. As the perfect man, Moses unites in himself, in a way, all the faculties of the patriarchal types. His is the &quot;most pure mind&quot; (&quot;De Mutatione Nominum&quot;, 37 [i. 610]), he is the &quot;lover of virtue&quot;, who has been purified from all passions (&quot;De Allegoriis Legum&quot;, iii. 45, 48 [i. 113, 115]). As the person awaiting the divine revelation, he is also specially fitted to announce it to others after receiving it in the form of the Commandments (ib. iii. 4 [i. 89 et seq.]).
#&quot;De Decalogo&quot;, the introductory treatise to the chief ten commandments of the Law.
#&quot;De Specialibus Legibus&quot;, in which treatise Philo attempts to systematize the several laws of the Torah and to arrange them in conformity with the Ten Commandments. To the first and second commandments he adds the laws relating to priests and sacrifices; to the third (misuse of the name of God), the laws on oaths, vows, etc.; to the fourth (on the Sabbath), the laws on festivals; to the fifth (to honor father and mother), the laws on respect for parents, old age, etc.; to the sixth, the marriage laws; to the seventh, the civil and criminal laws; to the eighth, the laws on theft; to the ninth, the laws on truthful testifying; and to the tenth, the laws on lust. The first book includes the following treatises of the current editions: &quot;De Circumcisione&quot;; &quot;De Monarchia&quot;, books i. and ii.; &quot;De Sacerdotum Honoribus&quot;; &quot;De Victimis&quot;. On the division of the book into these sections, the titles of the latter, and newly found sections of the text, see Schürer, l.c. p. 517; Wendland, l.c. pp. 136 et seq. The second book includes in the editions a section also entitled &quot;De Specialibus Legibus&quot; (ii. 270–277), to which is added the treatise &quot;De Septenario&quot;, which is, however, incomplete in Mangey. The greater part of the missing portion was supplied under the title &quot;De Cophini Festo et de Colendis Parentibus&quot; by Mai (1818) and was printed in Richter&#x27;s edition, v. 48–50, Leipsic, 1828. The complete text of the second book was published by Tischendorf in his &quot;Philonea&quot; (pp. 1–83). The third book is included under the title &quot;De Specialibus Legibus&quot; in ed. Mangey, ii. 299–334. The fourth book also is entitled &quot;De Specialibus Legibus&quot;; to it, the last sections are added under the titles &quot;De Judice&quot; and &quot;De Concupiscentia&quot; in the usual editions, and they include, also, as an appendix, the sections &quot;De Justitia&quot; and &quot;De Creatione Principum&quot;. 
#The treatises &quot;De Fortitudine&quot;, &quot;De Caritate&quot;, and &quot;De Pœnitentia&quot; are a kind of appendix to &quot;De Specialibus Legibus&quot;. combines them into a special book, which, he thinks, was composed by Philo.
#&quot;De Præmiis et Pœnis&quot; and &quot;De Execratione&quot;. On the connection of both This is the conclusion of the exposition of the Mosaic law.

This exposition is more exoteric than allegorical and might have been intended for gentile audiences.

=== Independent works ===
Philo is also credited with writing:
* Apologies for Judaism, including &quot;On the Life of Moses&quot;, &quot;On the Jews&quot;, and &quot;On the Contemplative Life&quot;.
* Historical works (describing current events in Alexandria and the Roman Empire), including &quot;Ad Flaccum&quot; and &quot;De legatione ad Gaium&quot;
* Philosophical works including &quot;Every Good Man Is Free&quot;, &quot;On the Eternity of the World&quot;, &quot;On Animals&quot;, and &quot;On Providence&quot;, the latter two surviving only through Armenian translation.
* Works now lost, but mentioned by Eusebius of Caesarea.

#&quot;On Providence&quot;, preserved only in Armenian, and printed from Aucher&#x27;s Latin translation in the editions of Richter and others (on Greek fragments of the work see Schürer, l.c. pp. 531 et seq.).
#&quot;De Animalibus&quot; (on the title, see Schürer, l.c. p. 532; in Richter&#x27;s ed. viii. 101–144).
#ϓποθετικά (&quot;Counsels&quot;), a work known only through fragments in Eusebius, &quot;Præparatio Evangelica&quot;, viii. 6, 7. The meaning of the title is open to discussion; it may be identical with the following
#Περὶ Ἰουδαίων an apology for the Jews (Schürer, l.c. pp. 532 et seq.).

==== That all good men are free ====
This is the second half of a work on the freedom of the just according to Stoic principles. The genuineness of this work has been disputed by Frankel (in &quot;Monatsschrift&quot;, ii. 30 et seq., 61 et seq.), by Grätz (&quot;Gesch.&quot; iii. 464 et seq.), and more recently by Ansfeld (1887), Hilgenfeld (in &quot;Zeitschrift für Wissenschaftliche Theologie&quot;, 1888, pp. 49–71), and others. Now Wendland, Ohle, Schürer, Massebieau, and Krell consider it genuine, except the partly interpolated passages on the Essenes.

==== &quot;Embassy to Gaius&quot; ====
In (&quot;Embassy to Gaius&quot;), Philo describes his diplomatic mission to Gaius Caligula, one of the few events in his life which is explicitly known. He relates that he was carrying a petition describing the sufferings of the Alexandrian Jews and asking the emperor to secure their rights. 

==== &quot;Against Flaccus&quot; ====
In &quot;Against Flaccus&quot;, Philo describes the situation of the Jews in Egypt, writing that they numbered not less than a million and inhabited two of the five districts in Alexandria. He recounts the abuses of the prefect Aulus Avilius Flaccus, who he says retaliated against the Jews when they refused to worship Caligula as a god. Daniel Schwartz surmises that given this tense background, it may have been politically convenient for Philo to favor abstract monotheism instead of overt pro-Judeanism.

Philo considers Caligula&#x27;s plan to erect a statue of himself in the Second Temple to be a provocation, asking, &quot;Are you making war upon us, because you anticipate that we will not endure such indignity, but that we will fight on behalf of our laws, and die in defence of our national customs? For you cannot possibly have been ignorant of what was likely to result from your attempt to introduce these innovations respecting our temple.&quot; In his entire presentation, he implicitly supports the Jewish commitment to rebel against the emperor rather than allow such sacrilege to take place.

This account, consisting initially of five books, has been preserved in fragments only (see Schürer, l.c. pp. 525 et seq.). Philo intended to show the fearful punishment meted out by God to the persecutors of the Jews (on Philo&#x27;s predilection for similar discussions see Siegfried, &quot;Philo von Alexandria&quot;, p. 157). Philo says he was regarded by his people as having unusual prudence due to his age, education, and knowledge. This indicates that he was already an older man at this time (40 CE).

==== &quot;On the Contemplative Life&quot; ====
This work describes the mode of life and the religious festivals of a society of Jewish ascetics, who, according to the author, are widely scattered over the earth and are found predominantly in every nome in Egypt. The writer, however, confines himself to describing the Therapeutae, a colony of hermits settled on Lake Mareotis in Egypt, where each lives separately in his own dwelling. Six days of the week they spend in pious contemplation, chiefly in connection with Scripture. On the seventh day, both men and women assemble together in a hall, and the leader delivers a discourse consisting of an allegorical interpretation of a scriptural passage. The feast of the fiftieth day is the most celebrated. The ceremony begins with a frugal meal consisting of bread, salted vegetables, and water, during which a passage of Scripture is interpreted. After the meal, the members of the society, in turn, sing religious songs of various kinds, to which the assembly answers with a refrain. The ceremony ends with a choral representation of the triumphal festival Moses and Miriam arranged after the passage through the Red Sea, the voices of the men and the women uniting in a choral symphony until the sun rises. After a common morning prayer, each goes home to resume contemplation. Such is the contemplative life (βίος θεωρητικός) led by these Θεραπευταί (&quot;servants of Yhwh&quot;).

The ancient Christian Church regarded these &quot;Therapeutæ&quot; as disguised Christian monks. This view has found advocates even recently P. E. Lucius&#x27;s opinion, particularly that the Christian monastery of the third century was here glorified in a Jewish disguise, was widely accepted (&quot;Die Therapeuten&quot;, 1879).

Massebieau (&quot;Revue de l&#x27;Histoire des Religions&quot;, 1887, xvi. 170 et seq., 284 et seq.), Conybeare (&quot;Philo About the Contemplative Life&quot;, Oxford, 1895), and Wendland (&quot;Die Therapeuten&quot;, etc., Leipsig, 1896) ascribe the entire work to Philo, basing their argument wholly on linguistic reasons, which seem sufficiently conclusive. However, there are significant dissimilarities between the fundamental conceptions of the author of the &quot;De Vita Contemplativa&quot; and those of Philo. The latter looks upon Greek culture and philosophy as allies, and the former is hostile to Greek philosophy (see Siegfried in &quot;Protestantische Kirchenzeitung&quot;, 1896, No.42). He repudiates a science that numbered among Its followers the sacred band of the Pythagoreans, inspired men like Parmenides, Empedocles, Zeno, Cleanthes, Heraclitus, and Plato, whom Philo prized (&quot;Quod Omnis Probus&quot;, i., ii.; &quot;Quis Rerum Divinarum Heres Sit&quot;, 43; &quot;De Providentia&quot;, ii. 42, 48, etc.). He considers the symposium a detestable, common drinking bout. This can not be explained as a Stoic diatribe, for Philo would not have repeated it in this case. And Philo would have been the last to interpret the Platonic Eros in the vulgar way in which it is explained in the &quot;De Vita Contemplativa&quot;, 7 (ii. 480), as he repeatedly uses the myth of double man allegorically in his interpretation of Scripture (&quot;De Opificio Mundi&quot;, 24; &quot;De Allegoriis Legum&quot;, ii. 24). It must furthermore be remembered that Philo in none of his other works mentions these colonies of allegorizing ascetics, in which he would have been highly interested had he known of them. However, pupils of Philo may subsequently have founded similar colonies near Alexandria that endeavored to realize his ideal of a pure life triumphing over the senses and passions, and they might also have been responsible for the one-sided development of certain of the master&#x27;s principles. While Philo desired to renounce the lusts of this world, he held fast to the scientific culture of Hellenism, which the author of this book denounces. Although Philo liked to withdraw from the world to give himself up entirely to contemplation and bitterly regretted the lack of such repose (&quot;De Specialibus Legibus&quot;, 1 [ii. 299]), he did not abandon the work that was required of him by the welfare of his people.

===Other works ascribed to Philo===

*&quot;De Mundo&quot;, a collection of extracts from Philo, especially from the preceding work
*&quot;De Sampsone&quot; and &quot;De Jona&quot;, in Armenian, published with Latin translation by Jean-Baptiste Aucher.
*&quot;Interpretatio Hebraicorum Nominum&quot;, a collection, by an anonymous Jew, of the Hebrew names occurring in Philo. Origen enlarged it by adding New Testament names, and Jerome revised it. See below for the etymology of names occurring in Philo&#x27;s exegetical works.
*A &quot;Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum&quot;, which was printed in the sixteenth century and then disappeared, has been discussed by Cohn in &quot;J. Q. R.&quot; 1898, x. 277–332. It narrates Biblical history from Adam to Saul
*The pseudo-Philonic &quot;Breviarium Temporum&quot;, published by Annius of Viterbo
For a list of Philo&#x27;s lost works, see Schürer, l.c. p. 534.
*&quot;De Incorruptibilitate Mundi&quot;. Jakob Bernays has argued convincingly that this work is spurious. Its basic idea that the world is eternal and indestructible contradicts all those Jewish teachings that were, for Philo, an indisputable presupposition. Bernays has proved simultaneously that the text has been confused through wrong pagination, and he has cleverly restored it.

== Legacy ==
Although Philo was a Jewish Middle Platonist, his influence on both Platonism and Judaism was limited compared to his adaptation by the early Christian Church fathers. His impact on Platonism was mainly restricted to Christian Middle Platonists such as Clement of Alexandria and Origen, and even potential connections to Numenius of Apamea, a 2nd-century CE Middle Platonist who also wrote on Judaism and was influenced by Pythagoreanism, cannot be definitively proven.

=== Judaism ===
Though never properly attributed, Philo&#x27;s marriage of Jewish exegesis with Stoicism and Platonism provided a formula later picked up by other Midrash content from the 3rd and 4th centuries. Philo&#x27;s ideas were further developed by later Judaism in the doctrines of the Divine Word creating the world, the divine throne-chariot and its cherub, the divine splendor and its Shekhinah, the name of God, as well as the names of the angels.

Some claimed this lack of credit or affinity for Philo by the Rabbinic leadership at the time was due to his adoption of allegorical instead of literal interpretations of the Hebrew Bible. However, this was more likely due to his criticism of Rabbinic scholars, as Philo argued their works and ideas were &quot;full of Sybaritic profligacy and licentiousness to their everlasting shame&quot;, &quot;eager to give a specious appearance to infamous actions, so as to secure notoriety for disgraceful deeds&quot;, and ultimately, that he &quot;disregards the envious disposition of such men, and shall proceed to narrate the true events of Moses&#x27; life,&quot; of which he felt were unjustly hidden.

For a long time, Philo was read and analyzed chiefly by Christian authors. Azariah dei Rossi&#x27;s &quot;Me&#x27;or Enayim: Imre Binah&quot; (1575), one of the first Jewish commentaries on Philo, describes four &quot;serious defects&quot; of Philo: reading the Torah in Greek, not Hebrew; belief in primordial matter rather than ; unbelief in the Lord as evidenced by excessively allegorical interpretation of scripture; and neglect of the Jewish oral tradition. Dei Rossi later gives a possible defense of Philo and writes that he can neither absolve nor convict him.

== List of extant works ==
Some 50 works by Philo have survived, and he is known to have written some 20 to 25 further works which have been lost.

<text>Babar the Elephant (, ; ) is an elephant character named Babar who first appeared in 1931 in the French children&#x27;s book &quot;Histoire de Babar&quot; by Jean de Brunhoff.

The book is based on a tale that Brunhoff&#x27;s wife, Cécile, had invented for their children. It tells of a young African elephant, named Babar, whose mother is killed by a big game hunter. Babar the Elephant escapes, and in the process leaves the jungle in exile, visits a big city, and returns to bring the benefits of civilization to his fellow elephants. Just as he returns to his community of elephants, their king tragically dies from eating a poisonous mushroom. Because of his travels and civilization, Babar is chosen king of the elephant kingdom. He marries his cousin, Celeste (), and they subsequently have children and teach them valuable lessons.

==Story synopsis==
After Babar&#x27;s mother is shot and killed by a hunter, he flees the jungle and finds his way to an unspecified big city with no particular characteristics. He is befriended by the Old Lady, who buys him clothes and hires him a tutor. Babar&#x27;s cousins Celeste and Arthur find him in the big city and help him return to the Elephant realm. Following the death of the King of the Elephants, who had eaten a poisonous mushroom (the illustrations indicate that it is a fly agaric), a council of old elephants approach Babar, saying that as he has &quot;lived among men and learnt much&quot;, he would be suitable to become the new King. Babar is crowned King of the Elephants and marries his cousin, Celeste.

In Jean de Brunhoff&#x27;s second Babar book, &quot;The Travels of Babar&quot;, when the married couple leave by balloon on their honeymoon:

... stormy winds down the balloon on an island, and yet again will the royal couple escape by whale, be marooned on an even smaller island and be rescued by a passing ocean liner only to be turned over to an animal trainer and put to work in a circus. And when they escape and return home, what awaits them but war with the rhinoceroses.

It was sparked when Arthur tied a firecracker to the tail of Lord Rataxes. Babar wins the war by having the elephants paint monster faces on their backsides, which cause the frightened rhinoceroses to run away. After the victory celebrations, the book ends with Babar, Celeste and the Old Lady sitting together and discussing how Babar can rule wisely and make all the elephants happy.

In the third book, &quot;Babar the King&quot;, Babar founds the city of Celesteville. After many dromedaries are found, they help with building the city. Each elephant citizen is given a job to do. Once the city is built, everyone celebrates. However, problems arise; the Old Lady is bitten by a snake, and Cornelius&#x27; home catches fire. Babar has a dream where he is visited by Misfortune and other demons which are chased away by elephant angels representing Courage, Hope, and other virtues. The morning after the hopeful dream, the Old Lady and Cornelius make full recoveries.

Among Babar&#x27;s other associates in the various incarnations of the series are the monkey Zephir, the old elephant counsellor Cornelius (also later Pompadour who was created for the &quot;Babar&quot; television series), Babar&#x27;s cousin Arthur, and Babar&#x27;s children, Pom, Flora, and Alexander. A younger daughter, Isabelle, is later introduced. The Old Lady comes to live in the Kingdom as an honored guest.

Besides his Westernizing policies, Babar engages in battle with the warlike rhinoceroses of a hostile bordering nation, led by Lord Rataxes. Much later, in &quot;Babar and the Adventures of Badou&quot;, Pom grows to become the father of Prince Babar II (known as Badou).

==History==
In 1931, Jean de Brunhoff introduced Babar in &quot;Histoire de Babar&quot;, and Babar enjoyed immediate success. In 1933, A.A. Milne introduced an English-language version, &quot;The Story of Babar&quot;, in Britain and the United States.

Before his death in 1937, Jean de Brunhoff published six more stories. His son Laurent de Brunhoff, also a writer and illustrator, carried on the series from 1946, beginning with &quot;Babar et Le Coquin d&#x27;Arthur&quot;.

An animated television series, &quot;Babar&quot; was produced in Canada by Nelvana Limited and the Clifford Ross Company, running from 3 January 1989 to 5 June 1991, with 65 episodes. An additional 13 episodes aired in 2000. The character has also appeared in a number of films. The first two of Jean de Brunhoff&#x27;s Babar books have inspired two major concert works: &quot;L&#x27;Histoire de Babar, le petit éléphant&quot; (&quot;The Story of Babar, the Little Elephant&quot;) by Francis Poulenc in 1940; and &quot;The Travels of Babar (Le Voyage de Babar)&quot; by Raphael Mostel in 1994. In 2010, a sequel and spin-off, &quot;Babar and the Adventures of Badou&quot;, was released, introducing new characters, including Badou, Babar&#x27;s grandson and Pom&#x27;s son. It takes place several years after the original series.

==Influence and legacy==
Babar, who likes to wear a bright green suit, introduces a very French form of Western civilization to the elephants, and they soon dress in Western attire. The attention to stylish clothing perhaps reflects the fact that the original publisher of the books was &quot;Editions du Jardin des Modes&quot;, owned by Condé-Nast. The Babar books were the first Condé-Nast publications not specifically about fashion.

Author Maurice Sendak described the innovations of Jean de Brunhoff:

Like an extravagant piece of poetry, the interplay between few words and many pictures, commonly called the picture book, is a difficult, exquisite, and most easily collapsible form that few have mastered...Jean de Brunhoff was a master of this form. Between 1931 and 1937 he completed a body of work that forever changed the face of the illustrated book.
The series has over 100 licensees worldwide, and the &quot;Babar&quot; brand has a multi-generational following. There are 12 Babar stores in Japan. A global cultural phenomenon, whose fans span generations, Babar stands along with Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse as one of the most recognized children&#x27;s characters in the world. There are now over 30,000 Babar publications in over 17 languages, and over 8 million books have been sold. Laurent de Brunhoff&#x27;s &quot;Babar&#x27;s Yoga for Elephants&quot; is a top seller in the U.S. with over 100,000 copies sold to date. The Babar series of books are recommended reading on former First Lady Laura Bush&#x27;s national reading initiative list. All 78 episodes of the TV series are broadcast in 30 languages in over 150 countries, making Babar one of the largest distributed animation shows in history. Babar has been a perennial favourite for years at the White House Easter Egg Roll.

Since 2001, the Babar franchise has been owned by Corus Entertainment&#x27;s Nelvana in conjunction with the artist, Clifford Ross.

Babar made a nameless appearance in &quot;The New Traveller&#x27;s Almanac&quot; (part of &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; series). Babar and his elephants escort Mina Murray and Allan Quatermain through the African jungle. Mina considers them &quot;civilized and gentle&quot;, but Allan denies that their leader is really wearing a crown.

In the 1988 comedy film &quot;Coming to America&quot;, the Joffer royal family have a pet elephant named &quot;Babar&quot;. In 1993, de Brunhoff&#x27;s elephant inspired the BaBar experiment, an international hadron physics collaboration based in the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory at Stanford University.

==Criticism==
Herbert R. Kohl and Vivian Paley, have argued that, although superficially delightful, the stories can be seen as a justification for colonialism. Others argue that the French civilization described in the early books had already been destroyed by World War I and the books were an exercise in nostalgia for pre-1914 France. Ariel Dorfman&#x27;s &quot;The Empire&#x27;s Old Clothes&quot; is another critical view, in which he concludes: &quot;In imagining the independence of the land of the elephants, Jean de Brunhoff anticipates, more than a decade before history forced Europe to put it into practice, the theory of neocolonialism&quot;.

In April 2012, &quot;Babar&#x27;s Travels&quot; was removed from the shelves by library staff in East Sussex in response to parental complaints for what was perceived as stereotypes of Africans. Jean de Brunhoff&#x27;s son Laurent de Brunhoff was embarrassed by stereotypical Africans and Native Americans in &quot;Babar&#x27;s Picnic&quot; and asked the publisher to withdraw it.

A more sympathetic view is expressed in the 2008 &quot;New Yorker&quot; article &quot;Freeing the Elephants&quot;, in which Adam Gopnik argues it &quot;is not an unconscious expression of the French colonial imagination; it is a self-conscious comedy about the French colonial imagination and its close relation to the French domestic imagination. The gist ... is explicit and intelligent: the lure of the city, of civilization, of style and order and bourgeois living is real, for elephants as for humans&quot;. He concludes that the satisfaction derived from &quot;Babar&quot; is based on the knowledge that &quot;while it is a very good thing to be an elephant, still, the life of an elephant is dangerous, wild, and painful. It is therefore a safer thing to be an elephant in a house near a park&quot;.

<text>Nelvana Limited (; also known as Nelvana Enterprises, Nelvana International or Nelvana Digital; commonly known as Nelvana; stylized as &quot;nelvana&quot;) is a Canadian animation studio and entertainment production company owned by Corus Entertainment since 2000. Founded in July 1971 by Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert, and Clive A. Smith, it was named after Nelvana of the Northern Lights, the first Canadian national superhero, who was created by Adrian Dingle. The company&#x27;s production logo is a polar bear looking at Polaris, the North Star.

The company is based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in North America and it maintains international offices in France, Ireland and Japan, as well as smaller offices in the top three cities in the U.S. Many of its films, shows and specials are based on licensed properties and literature, but original programming is also part of its roster. Although the company specializes in children&#x27;s media, Nelvana has also co-produced adult animations like the first season of &quot;Clone High&quot;, &quot;John Callahan&#x27;s Quads!&quot;, &quot;Bob &amp; Margaret&quot;, and &quot;Committed&quot;.

Nelvana International distributes three Nickelodeon shows: &quot;Taina&quot;, the first five seasons of &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, and &quot;The Backyardigans&quot; (a co-production with Nick Jr.). , its library comprised more than 1,650 cumulative half-hours of original programming.

==History==
===Laff Arts===
Michael Hirsh and Patrick Loubert first met as friends and partners at York University, Canada in 1967. They made films with other students. This was Loubert&#x27;s first experience with filming; he recalled:

The fledgling Canadian television and film industry was developing at the time. Loubert, Hirsh, and York University friends Jack Christie and Peter Dewdney founded a small company named Laff Arts that produced small experimental films. They were joined by Vitaphone animator-designer Clive A. Smith in Toronto, Ontario; Smith&#x27;s interest was in rock n&#x27; roll music, and helped produce the Beatles&#x27; animated series and 1968 film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; before moving to Canada to work on short films and commercials.

Smith designed the company&#x27;s business card; on the front was a suited businessman, and inside was the businessman with the pants down. The company was dissolved after an ad agency advised them that the company&#x27;s name was unprofessional.

===Nelvana===

Nelvana was founded by Hirsh, Loubert, and Smith in 1971. Hirsh recalls:

They bought ownership rights to a collection of local comic books from the 1940s and then produced a half-hour television documentary focused on Canadian comics for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Their two-year travelling tour of the art from the National Gallery of Canada, &quot;Comic Art Traditions in Canada, 1941–45&quot;, gave locals a chance to revisit the country&#x27;s past heritage in that field. Meanwhile, Hirsh and Loubert collaborated on a related primer from Peter Martin and Associates, &quot;The Great Canadian Comic Books&quot;. During this time the new company was named Nelvana after World War II-era Canadian comic book superheroine Nelvana of the Northern Lights.

A derelict apartment in downtown Toronto served as the company&#x27;s first building, and a homemade wooden stand mounted over a toilet was among its first camera equipment. &quot;To create zooms,&quot; Hirsh recalled of his early experience with this machine, &quot;we would pile up phone books under the art work.&quot; During their first year and a half, the trio lived off a superfluous Chargex credit card that Loubert received at university, spending up to C$7,500 on it before they reclaimed double that cost as their first ever transaction. Under those conditions, Nelvana was involved in the production of documentaries and live-action films during the early 1970s. In the area of part-time animation work, they made ten C$1,500 fillers for the CBC.

Among the studio&#x27;s first productions was a low-budget CBC short subject series, &quot;Small Star Cinema&quot;, which combined live-action and animation to tell stories of ordinary life from a child&#x27;s point of view. It was followed by Nelvana&#x27;s first ever television special &quot;Christmas Two Step&quot; in 1975, a similarly styled special in which a girl tries to be a lead dancer at a Christmas pageant. When Nelvana was founded in 1971, their original goal was to make live-action programs involving animation in them during their early days.

Nelvana worked on their first television specials: &quot;A Cosmic Christmas&quot; (1977), &quot;The Devil and Daniel Mouse&quot; (1978), &quot;Romie-0 and Julie-8&quot; (1979), &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Eat the Planet&quot; (better known by its subtitle, &quot;Intergalactic Thanksgiving&quot;) (1979), &quot;Easter Fever&quot; (1980) and &quot;Take Me Up to the Ball Game&quot; (1980). During that time, George Lucas, who was impressed with &quot;A Cosmic Christmas&quot;, commissioned the company to work on a 10-minute sequence for the CBS and CTV TV film &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; in 1978. This short scene, officially entitled &quot;The Faithful Wookiee&quot;, featured the voices of Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels and James Earl Jones, and introduced the bounty hunter Boba Fett.

===1980s===
At the beginning of the 1980s, Nelvana chose to co-produce its first feature film, &quot;Rock &amp; Rule&quot;, over working on &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, internationally-produced animated science fiction anthology. &quot;Rock &amp; Rule&quot; was inspired by &quot;The Devil and Daniel Mouse&quot; and cost five years and $8 million using all of the studio&#x27;s resources. The film was released by MGM/UA in 1983 with little promotion in the U.S. and was a financial failure. The company survived by working full-time on children&#x27;s television series. These included its first three live-action franchises (&quot;The Edison Twins&quot;, &quot;20 Minute Workout&quot; and &quot;Mr. Microchip&quot;), the first season of &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; with DIC Entertainment, and the pilot episode of &quot;The Get Along Gang&quot;.

Early in the decade, the company worked on four television specials based on American Greetings properties. They were &quot;The Magic of Herself the Elf&quot;, based on Mattel&#x27;s toy line; &quot;Strawberry Shortcake: Housewarming Surprise&quot;; &quot;Strawberry Shortcake and the Baby Without a Name&quot;; and &quot;Strawberry Shortcake Meets the Berrykins&quot;, the last three of which featured the eponymous doll. There were two shows made by Nelvana based on the AmToy properties, &quot;Madballs&quot; and &quot;My Pet Monster&quot;.

Despite the successes of their earlier works, perhaps its greatest success at the time came in the form of the Care Bears, thanks to its acquisition of the character rights from American Greetings, the franchise owners. In early 1985, the first film based on the toy line turned the company&#x27;s assets around, grossing US$23 million in the U.S., and another $1.5 million in its native Canada. Its tremendous success gave way to two more feature films, &quot;A New Generation&quot; and &quot;Adventure in Wonderland&quot;, as well as a television series.
In the area of science fiction, Nelvana co-produced &quot;Droids&quot; and &quot;Ewoks&quot;, two Saturday-morning series based on &quot;Star Wars&quot;. At one point, there was talk of an animated CBS show from the studio, based on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot;; the plan never came to fruition, but concept art was created by Ted Bastien.

For Orion Pictures&#x27; 1986 live-action western comedy, &quot;Three Amigos&quot;, the company made use of lip-sync animation for a musical sequence in which the main characters sing a song at a campfire, with their horses singing along. In 1987, Michael Hirsh co-produced Nelvana&#x27;s first self-made film of this calibre, the comedy feature &quot;Burglar&quot;, which was the first live-action feature film the company had ever co-produced.

Also in 1987, the company, along with independent filmmaker Pierre David, film, video, and television production company Malofilm Group, and home video distributor New Star Entertainment, formed Image Organization, an independent production company that mainly specialized in the thriller genre and tied itself to over 100 films in the international market by 1996. Nelvana and New Star would sell their shares in the company to David and Malofilm in 1989.

In 1988, Nelvana and Scholastic Corporation co-produced a video series of The Video Adventures of Clifford the Big Red Dog based on the 1962 book. It was also distributed by Family Home Entertainment on the video releases.

The company&#x27;s fourth live-action series, &quot;T. and T.&quot;, premiered in 1988 on Canada&#x27;s Global network. The show&#x27;s titular duo was Mr. T of &quot;A-Team&quot; fame, playing a former boxer named T.S. Turner, and Canadian actress Kristina Nicoll as an East Coast lawyer by the name of Terri Taler. Nelvana faced bankruptcy for the second time when the show&#x27;s original U.S. distributor, Qintex Entertainment (formerly Hal Roach Studios) was going out of business; in six weeks, they were saved when they found a replacement. Also that year, Nelvana established BearSpots, a facility for producing television commercials that lasted until 1993.

As the decade came to a close, the revived Nelvana had its next big success with and an HBO television show based on Jean de Brunhoff&#x27;s &quot;Babar&quot; book series. This franchise, its first international co-production, won many ACE Awards in the U.S. and Geminis in Canada. In September 1989, ABC began to air &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, a show co-produced by Nelvana and based on the film by Tim Burton.

===1990s===
Following &quot;Babar&quot;&#x27;s success, the studio acquired the rights to animated series based on Hergé&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, Maurice Sendak&#x27;s &quot;Little Bear&quot;, Joanna Cole&#x27;s &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; and the British comic strip &quot;Rupert Bear&quot;. Nelvana had self-made successes of its own during the 1990s, such as &quot;Eek! The Cat&quot;, &quot;Dog City&quot; (with The Jim Henson Company) and &quot;Ned&#x27;s Newt&quot; (with TMO Film GmbH). Less successful was its animated series for children, Roseanne Barr&#x27;s &quot;Little Rosey&quot;, for the American Broadcasting Company, which was cancelled in 1991, after its first season.

In Autumn 1993, Nelvana signed a multi-year project to co-produce five feature films for Paramount Pictures, with Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall co-producing; the first two began co-production the following summer, at a cost of over US$20 million each. Three of the projects were based on books by E. B. White (&quot;The Trumpet of the Swan&quot;), Clive Barker (&quot;The Thief of Always&quot;) and Graeme Base (&quot;The Sign of the Seahorse&quot;); an original co-production called &quot;Mask Vision&quot; was also in the works.

However, none of those films ever made it past the finishing stage. During the 1990s, another set of features from Nelvana was distributed by various companies. A 1993 live-action psychological thriller called &quot;Malice&quot; came out under the Columbia Pictures banner; 1997 saw the studio&#x27;s retelling of &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; from Warner Bros.; and &quot;&quot; was released in Canada by Alliance Atlantis in 1999. Among them, only &quot;Malice&quot; would go on to achieve box-office success in North America. Its US$46 million gross was the highest ever attained by a Nelvana co-production, doubling what the first &quot;Care Bears Movie&quot; received during its original release.

In 1993, Nelvana along with Galaxy Films and De Souza Productions co-produced &quot;Cadillacs and Dinosaurs&quot; for the CBS network, based on the comic book of the same name (formally known as &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot;) by Mark Schultz. It only lasted one season.

In September 1995, Nelvana co-produced &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; and &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot; based on the popular well-known book series. Tracy Ryan portrayed Nancy Drew while Colin Gray and Paul Popowich portrayed Frank and Joe Hardy, respectively. In addition, Jehene Erwin and Joy Tanner portrayed Bess Marvin and George Fayne, respectively, on &quot;Nancy Drew&quot;, while Fiona Highet played new character Kate Craigen. The series were based on &quot;The Nancy Drew Files&quot; and &quot;The Hardy Boys Casefiles&quot;. However, the series was not distributed well, mostly due to it being in first-run syndication, and both series were cancelled in December.

In September 1996, Golden Books Family Entertainment was in talks to acquire the company for US$102 million, just after having purchased the family video library of Broadway Video Entertainment, a subsidiary of Broadway Video. Many of the company&#x27;s staff members, including Smith and Loubert, expressed interest in the proposition. But Hirsh went up against it, arguing with then COO Eleanor Olmsted about its possible effects on his institution. Two months later Golden Books withdrew from the deal stating that they would concentrate more on children&#x27;s entertainment.

In November 1996, Virgin Interactive released &quot;Toonstruck&quot;, a PC-based adventure game featuring animation and artwork co-produced by Nelvana and Rainbow Animation. The game was set in an animated world using traditional 2D animation, but also featured the digitized likeness of actor Christopher Lloyd as a live-action character trapped in the animated world interacting with the cartoon characters around him. A sequel to the game was planned, but was cancelled due to poor sales.

In 1997, a small computer animation company called Windlight Studios was absorbed into Nelvana&#x27;s assets. Its co-founder, Scott Dyer, became Nelvana&#x27;s senior vice-president in charge of production in late 2001.

In late 1997, Nelvana and the United Kingdom&#x27;s Channel 4 began work on &quot;Bob and Margaret&quot;, the company&#x27;s first animated franchise for adults since &quot;Rock &amp; Rule&quot;. It was based on the National Film Board of Canada&#x27;s &quot;Bob&#x27;s Birthday&quot;, an Academy Award winner for Best Short, which Channel 4 also co-produced.

In December 1997, Nelvana began distributing a syndicated programming block, the Nelvana Kidz Klub, through MediaVentures International, a Chicago-based distributor. The block was offered internationally on a barter program distribution model with one–two hours of daily sections or three–four hours of the weekend block.

In 1998, Nelvana entered into an agreement with U.S. network CBS to program a new Saturday morning animation block for the 1998-99 television season, which would be branded as CBS Kidshow. The block would feature six new series based on children&#x27;s book properties, and all were to comply with the U.S. government&#x27;s educational programming guidelines. In April 1998, Nelvana entered into an agreement with ITV franchise Scottish Television to co-produce these new series, and hold distribution rights to them in the United Kingdom. In August 1998, Nelvana acquired Kids Can Press, publishers of the &quot;Franklin&quot; and &quot;Elliot Moose&quot; children&#x27;s books upon which the &quot;Franklin&quot; and &quot;Elliot Moose&quot; were based. This turned them into an &quot;integrated company&quot; in which Kids Can&#x27;s subsequent publications would begin with Nelvana&#x27;s franchising of those works.

The company&#x27;s first two computer-animated shows, &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; and &quot;Rolie Polie Olie&quot; (with Paris-based Sparx* and distributed by Disney Channel), premiered on U.S. television in 1998.

In March 1999, Nelvana reported a 75% increase in earnings in 1998, credited to increased original production and sales of its library programming, the deal with CBS, and the addition of a publishing business with the acquisition of Kids Can Press. In August 1999, Nelvana announced a US$40 million deal to produce six new series based on popular children&#x27;s books for a planned PBS block. The six series—&quot;Corduroy&quot;, &quot;Elliot Moose&quot;, &quot;Timothy Goes to School&quot;, &quot;Seven Little Monsters&quot;, &quot;George Shrinks&quot;, and &quot;Marvin the Tap-Dancing Horse&quot;—were launched the following September as part of the &quot;PBS Kids Bookworm Bunch&quot; line-up. That same month, it acquired the North American rights to its first anime property, Clamp&#x27;s &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; (which was renamed &quot;Cardcaptors&quot; for its English dub).

===2000s===

In April 2000, Nelvana announced that it had filed for two category 2 television licences from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to launch digital cable channels. The first, titled &quot;The Nelvana Channel&quot;, would&#x27;ve presented the company&#x27;s library of material alongside related information in a picture-in-picture format. The second, &quot;Booknet&quot;, was to be focused on adaptations of adult and children&#x27;s literature, and would have been a 60/40 joint venture between Corus Entertainment and Nelvana. The channels were approved that following November. Both licences expired as neither launched by the required date of November 24, 2004.

On April 14, 2000, Nelvana announced its purchase of the Palo Alto-based children&#x27;s book publisher Klutz in a US$74 million deal—at that time, its largest buyout ever—and integrated it into its Branded Consumer Products division. The company, founded in 1977, was best known for its children&#x27;s series, &quot;Books Plus&quot;. Nelvana&#x27;s separate subsidiary, Kids Can, began taking advantage of the acquisition by making its output available through Klutz merchandise.

In September 2000, Corus bought Nelvana for $540 million. The company saw the purchase as being a complement to its children&#x27;s television networks, including YTV and Treehouse.

A year after Corus&#x27; purchase, co-founders and co-CEOs Loubert and Smith left the studio. Loubert voluntarily left in November after Corus eliminated 50 positions from the staff, saying &quot;The time has come that Corus will stop acquiring for a while and start operating. John Cassaday has made that clear, but this makes my job less rather than more&quot;.

In 2001, Nelvana acquired the rights to the English-language version of yet another anime series, &quot;Medabots&quot;. The following January, &quot;Beyblade&quot; (in association with Hasbro and Mitsubishi) became its third such property.

In October 2002, Corus announced Hirsh&#x27;s resignation; the following month, Paul Robertson, former president of Corus Television and head of YTV, became leader of the studio&#x27;s senior management. With Hirsh&#x27;s departure, Corus announced a C$200 million writedown for the company; by next August, it planned to reduce the staff down to 200. Hirsh has also taken an advisory role in the studio.

The following September, Corus launched their home entertainment division. Texas-based FUNimation, along with British company Maverick, has distributed titles from the studio with this label, including &quot;Redwall&quot;, &quot;Pecola&quot;, &quot;Tales from the Cryptkeeper&quot;, &quot;Timothy Goes to School&quot; and the holiday special &quot;The Santa Claus Brothers&quot;. Nelvana&#x27;s newer titles have been distributed by MGM, Lionsgate and ADV Films, which have no involvement with the label. In 2007, home video distribution rights for the company&#x27;s catalogue were transferred to Shout! Factory.

In 2004, the studio co-produced an animation anthology, which included 10 recurring shorts. Titled &quot;Funpak&quot;, it aired on YTV for 13 weeks starting in February 2005, with the winning short announced to be greenlit in May of that year. One of the shorts, &quot;Sidekick&quot;, was the one adapted into a successful cartoon series from 2010–2013.

In May 2006, NBCUniversal announced a joint venture with Nelvana, Ion Media Networks, Scholastic, and Classic Media, known as Qubo, which aimed to operate a multi-platform children&#x27;s educational television brand in the U.S. featuring programming from its partners.

In September 2006, Nelvana was integrated into Corus&#x27;s children&#x27;s television division, headed by executive vice-president and general manager Scott Dyer who, in addition to Nelvana, oversaw YTV, Treehouse TV, and Discovery Kids Canada. A spin-off unit, Nelvana Enterprises, was created in the process, to focus on international distribution of the company&#x27;s shows. Doug Murphy became president of the new distribution unit.

In October 2006, Nelvana announced a co-production agreement with Canadian toy maker Spin Master and Japanese partners TMS Entertainment, Sega Toys and Japan Vistec to create the new anime property &quot;Bakugan Battle Brawlers&quot;. The series debuted in Canada on Teletoon the following summer and became a quick success. In 2008, merchandising rights were sold by Nelvana to Cartoon Network in the U.S., and the series began airing on the channel in February 2008. The initial incarnation of the franchise ran for four seasons, spanning 189 episodes and stimulated billions in merchandise sales.

===2010s===

Following &quot;Bakugan&quot;, Nelvana entered into another anime co-production, this time reviving the &quot;Beyblade&quot; property with d-rights, Takara Tomy and Hasbro. &quot;&quot; debuted globally in 2010, running for 167 episodes before inspiring a sub-franchise consisting of &quot;BeyWheelz&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

Their next program &quot;Mike the Knight&quot; debuted in 2011, a co-production between HIT Entertainment aired on Treehouse TV and CBeebies later in the year.

&quot;Detentionaire&quot; was produced between 2011 and 2015. Created for Teletoon, the show has also been aired internationally, including on ABC3, and has been released on a digital platform provided by Cartoon Network.

In 2012, Corus Entertainment acquired Canadian animation software developer Toon Boom. Nelvana had already used the company&#x27;s software on projects like &quot;6teen&quot;, &quot;Ruby Gloom&quot; as well as the aforementioned &quot;Detentionaire&quot;. Going forward, all of the studio&#x27;s internally animated 2D productions would utilize their sister company&#x27;s suite of products.

After Murphy had been appointed as CEO of Corus Entertainment, Scott Dyer was named president of Nelvana in 2015. The next year, Pam Westman became head of Nelvana.

On October 19, 2016, Nelvana redesigned their logo to mark the studio&#x27;s 45th anniversary, as well as take part in Corus&#x27; brand refresh following latter&#x27;s acquisition of Shaw Media. According to Dyer, this also symbolized a strategic shift from merchandise-based properties to more creator-driven projects, as well as a return to international co-productions. At that year&#x27;s MIPCOM, the studio showcased new shows &quot;Esme &amp; Roy&quot; (with Sesame Workshop), &quot;Hotel Transylvania: The Series&quot; and &quot;Mysticons&quot;. Nelvana also presented &quot;Bravest Warriors&quot;, a pre-existing series from Frederator Studios that they were now producing and &quot;Corn &amp; Peg&quot;, a co-production with the US Nickelodeon.

The following October, Nelvana announced the launch of a new joint venture with Discovery Communications (WBD) to create children&#x27;s content for Canada, Latin America and the rest of the world. Later named &quot;redknot&quot;, the division&#x27;s first two projects include &quot;The Dog &amp; Pony Show&quot; and &quot;Agent Binky: Pets of the Universe&quot;.

In 2018, Nelvana appointed Cinedigm as the company&#x27;s new U.S. home video partner. In late 2018, the company relaunched &quot;Bakugan&quot; with &quot;&quot;, a co-production between Nelvana, Spin Master Entertainment, TMS Entertainment and Man of Action Studios.

The studio launched its first short film, &quot;The Most Magnificent Thing&quot;, in 2019 to showcase its technical abilities. Later that year, Dyer announced his retirement, with Westman named as his replacement.

===2020s===
In October 2020, Nelvana agreed to co-produce &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends: All Engines Go&quot; (with Mattel Television), a re-imagined revival of the original &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; series, marking the franchise&#x27;s first 2D-animated television series. That same month, the company entered an agreement with Duncan Studio to produce animated feature films. The first project announced from this collaboration was a feature film adaptation of the Ryan Andrews novel &quot;This Was Our Pact&quot;. Written by Will Collins and starring Peter Dinklage as &quot;a mysterious and charismatic bear&quot;, the film will be co-produced by Dinklage through his production company, Estuary Films.

In July 2024, as a result of budget cuts and layoffs across Corus Entertainment, a number of positions at Nelvana were eliminated, including that of Vice President Athena Georgaklis, and all development of new projects was paused. Nelvana co-CEO John Gossling announced: &quot;We&#x27;re making tough decisions to shutter areas of the business we can no longer sustain and pause longer-term development activities while we implement efficiency initiatives.&quot; Nelvana also sold its software subsidiary Toon Boom Animation to private equity firm Integrated Media Company for $111 million to help Corus pay down debt.

==Franchises==
Many of Nelvana&#x27;s TV shows are based on properties from other companies, most of which started in other forms of media (excluding its namesake superhero, which never received an adaptation of any kind). A great deal of them are based on children&#x27;s literature and comic books; examples include &quot;Blazing Dragons&quot;, &quot;Stickin&#x27; Around&quot;, &quot;Wayside&quot;, &quot;Cadillacs and Dinosaurs&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, &quot;Anatole&quot;, &quot;Babar&quot;, &quot;The Berenstain Bears&quot;, &quot;Franklin&quot;, &quot;Jane and the Dragon&quot;, &quot;Little Bear&quot;, &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot;, &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot;, &quot;Redwall&quot;, &quot;Rupert&quot;, &quot;My Dad the Rock Star&quot;, and the shows of the &quot;PBS Kids Bookworm Bunch&quot; block, as well as &quot;Tales from the Cryptkeeper&quot;, &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, &quot;Jacob Two-Two&quot;, &quot;Sidekick&quot; and Teletoon/Nick Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Miss Spider&#x27;s Sunny Patch Friends&quot;.

Nelvana has also had considerable success with animated fare based on toys; American Greetings&#x27; &quot;Care Bears&quot; has been the most familiar example of this. Also, there have been series and specials based on &quot;Strawberry Shortcake&quot; (also from American Greetings), &quot;Madballs&quot; and &quot;My Pet Monster&quot; (from AmToy) and &quot;Rescue Heroes&quot; (from Fisher-Price). Nelvana also produced &quot;Fresh Beat Band of Spies&quot;, an animated revival of &quot;The Fresh Beat Band&quot; that is produced by 6 Point Harness for Nickelodeon.

It has also adapted big-screen franchises to televised properties, such as &quot;Star Wars&quot; (&quot;Droids&quot; and &quot;Ewoks&quot;), &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, &quot;An American Tail&quot; (&quot;Fievel&#x27;s American Tails&quot;), &quot;Free Willy&quot; and &quot;The Neverending Story&quot;. It has even ventured into the video game world with a show based on Nintendo&#x27;s Donkey Kong: &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;.

In the field of anime, the company holds the North American rights to Clamp/Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; series. Also, it holds international licensing rights to &quot;Beyblade&quot; and &quot;Medabots&quot; and the Bakugan franchise.

As with many other animation studios, Nelvana has a wide range of established original series and characters within its roster; &quot;6teen&quot;, &quot;Clone High&quot;, &quot;Birdz&quot;, &quot;Corn &amp; Peg&quot;, and &quot;Eek! The Cat&quot; are some of Nelvana&#x27;s more notable animated series not adapted from older works.

, the studio has made close to 25 feature films for theatre, home entertainment, and television distribution. Well-known releases include &quot;Rock &amp; Rule&quot;, the first five &quot;Care Bears&quot; films, two &quot;Babar&quot; films, and the 1997 &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot;.

Live-action has been a part of its mainstay from its early years. The company has had &quot;Burglar&quot; and &quot;Malice&quot; as its own feature projects in that area, and has contributed as such to &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; and &quot;Three Amigos&quot;. On television, Nelvana has made live-action shows such as &quot;The Edison Twins&quot;, &quot;Nancy Drew&quot;, &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot;, and &quot;Life with Boys&quot;.

On February 5, 2013, Nelvana launched the Treehouse Direct channel on YouTube.

On April 29, 2015, they launched a YouTube channel promoted by YTV as Nelvana Retro, which was renamed &quot;YTV Direct&quot; in 2016 after also deciding to incorporate non-Nelvana content such as Nickelodeon shows. It was later renamed Keep it Weird to incorporate more content from the company.

==Around the world==
&quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, created by animator Butch Hartman, was distributed by Nelvana outside the U.S. from 2001 to 2005. This show has been in the top of the ratings for Nickelodeon, YTV and the BBC, and has also been successful among viewers in all European markets, Latin America, Australia, and Canada. Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Taina&quot; was also distributed by Nelvana in 2001 and 2002. The series was cancelled in 2002, but had mixed to positive reviews and ratings in late 2001. Nick Jr.&#x27;s &quot;The Backyardigans&quot;, in addition to being distributed by Nelvana outside the U.S., was also co-produced by Nelvana.

In the United States, Nelvana&#x27;s series have been broadcast on terrestrial, cable, and streaming networks, and internationally on over 360 television stations in more 180 countries, in approximately 50 languages.

==Notable personnel==
Apart from its three founders, there have been several key personnel from Nelvana&#x27;s past and present, a great deal of whom have left the company. Some of the better-known people who have worked for the studio at one point or another include animators Wayne Gilbert, Peter Hudecki, Vincenzo Natali, Arna Selznick, Natalie Turner, and John van Bruggen, and voice actors Tara Strong, Cree Summer, Maurice LaMarche, and Michael Cera. The British and Canadian duo of Alison Snowden and David Fine won an Academy Award for animation before starting to work for Nelvana.

Former Nelvana employees Roger Allers, Charles Bonifacio, Ralph Palmer, Kori Rae, Joe Ranft, David Soren, and Ralph Zondag went on to become staff members at Walt Disney Feature Animation and DreamWorks Animation starting in the 1980s. Allers went on to work on &quot;Open Season&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, and &quot;Cars&quot;. Lenora Hume, from the company&#x27;s early years, is the senior vice-president of DisneyToon Studios and Pixar.

==Influence in popular culture==
The &quot;Nelvana Independent Short Film Grand Prize&quot;, given out at the Ottawa International Animation Festival from 2004 to 2006, was sponsored by the company. The recipients of this prize were 2004&#x27;s &quot;Ryan&quot;, the Chris Landreth biography about Canadian animator Ryan Larkin; 2005&#x27;s &quot;Milch&quot;, from director Igor Kovalyov; and, in 2006, Joanna Quinn&#x27;s &quot;Dreams and Desires: Family Ties&quot;.

<text>Patricia Neal (born Patsy Louise Neal; January 20, 1926 – August 8, 2010) was an American actress of stage and screen. She is well known for, among other roles, playing World WarII widow Helen Benson in &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951), radio journalist Marcia Jeffries in &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957), wealthy matron Emily Eustace Failenson in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961), and the worn-out housekeeper Alma Brown in &quot;Hud&quot; (1963) (for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress). She also featured as the matriarch in the television film &quot;The Homecoming: A Christmas Story&quot; (1971); her role as Olivia Walton was re-cast for the series it inspired, &quot;The Waltons&quot;. A major star of the 1950s and 1960s, she was the recipient of an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, and two British Academy Film Awards, and was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards.

==Early life and education==
Neal was born in Packard, Whitley County, Kentucky, to William Burdette Neal and Eura Mildred (née Petrey) Neal. She had two siblings.

Neal grew up in Knoxville, Tennessee, where she attended Knoxville High School, and studied drama at Northwestern, where she was a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority. At Northwestern, she was crowned Syllabus Queen in a campus-wide beauty pageant. She left Northwestern after talent scouts convinced her to leave for New York.

==Career==
Neal gained her first job in New York as an understudy in the Broadway production of the John Van Druten play &quot;The Voice of the Turtle&quot;. Next, she appeared in Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;Another Part of the Forest&quot; (1946), winning the 1947 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play, in the first presentation of the Tony awards.

Neal made her film debut with Ronald Reagan in &quot;John Loves Mary&quot;, followed by another role with Reagan in &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot;, and then &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (all 1949). The shooting of the last film coincided with her affair with her married co-star, Gary Cooper, with whom she worked again in &quot;Bright Leaf&quot; (1950).
Neal starred with John Garfield in &quot;The Breaking Point&quot; (1950), in &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951) with Michael Rennie, and in &quot;Operation Pacific&quot; (also 1951) starring John Wayne. She suffered a nervous breakdown around this time, following the end of her relationship with Cooper, and left Hollywood for New York, returning to Broadway in 1952 for a revival of &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;. In 1955, she starred in Edith Sommer&#x27;s &quot;A Roomful of Roses&quot;, staged by Guthrie McClintic.
While in New York, Neal became a member of the Actors Studio. Based on connections with other members, she subsequently co-starred in the film &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957, directed by Elia Kazan), the play &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; (1959, directed by Arthur Penn), the film &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961), and the film &quot;Hud&quot; (1963), directed by Martin Ritt and starring Paul Newman. During the same period, she appeared on television in an episode of &quot;The Play of the Week&quot; (1960), featuring an Actors Studio-dominated cast in a double bill of plays by August Strindberg, and in a British production of Clifford Odets&#x27; &quot;Clash by Night&quot; (1959), which co-starred one of the first generation of Actors Studio members, Nehemiah Persoff.
Neal won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;Hud&quot; (1963), co-starring with Paul Newman. When the film was initially released it was predicted she would be a nominee in the supporting actress category, but when she began collecting awards, they were always for Best Actress, from the New York Film Critics, the National Board of Review and a BAFTA award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.

Neal was re-united with John Wayne in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; (1965), winning her second BAFTA Award. Her next film was &quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot; (1968), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award. She starred as the matriarch in the television film &quot;The Homecoming: A Christmas Story&quot; (1971), which inspired the television series &quot;The Waltons&quot;; she won a Golden Globe for her performance. In a 1999 interview with the Archive of American Television, &quot;Waltons&quot; creator Earl Hamner said he and producers were unsure if Neal&#x27;s health would allow her to commit to the schedule of a weekly television series; so, instead, they cast Michael Learned in the role of Olivia Walton. Neal played a dying widowed mother trying to find a home for her three children in an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; broadcast in 1975.

Neal appeared in a series of television commercials in the 1970s and 1980s, notably for pain relief medicine Anacin and Maxim instant coffee.

Neal played the title role in Robert Altman&#x27;s movie &quot;Cookie&#x27;s Fortune&quot; (1999). She worked on Silvana Vienne&#x27;s movie &quot;Beyond Baklava: The Fairy Tale Story of Sylvia&#x27;s Baklava&quot; (2007), appearing as herself in the portions of the documentary talking about alternative ways to end violence in the world. In the same year as the film&#x27;s release, Neal received one of two annually-presented Lifetime Achievement Awards at the SunDeis Film Festival in Waltham, Massachusetts. (Academy Award nominee Roy Scheider was the recipient of the other.)

Having won a Tony Award in their inaugural year (1947) and eventually becoming the last surviving winner from that first ceremony, Neal often appeared as a presenter in later years. Her original Tony was lost, so she was given a surprise replacement by Bill Irwin when they were about to present the 2006 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play to Cynthia Nixon. In April 2009, Neal received a lifetime achievement award from WorldFest Houston on the occasion of the debut of her film, &quot;Flying By&quot;. Neal was a long-term actress with Philip Langner&#x27;s Theatre at Sea/Sail With the Stars productions with the Theatre Guild. In her final years she appeared in a number of health-care videos.

Neal was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 2003. She was a subject of the British television show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1978 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at a cocktail party on London&#x27;s Park Lane.

==Personal life==

In 1948, either during filming or after finishing work on &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (1949), Neal began an affair with her married co-star Gary Cooper, whom she had met in 1947 when she was 21 and he was 46. Cooper&#x27;s wife confronted him and Cooper confessed that he was in love with Neal, and continued to see her. Cooper and his wife were legally separated in May 1951, but he did not seek a divorce. Neal later claimed that Cooper hit her after she went on a date with Kirk Douglas, and that he arranged for her to have an abortion when she became pregnant with Cooper&#x27;s child. Neal ended their relationship in late December 1951. 

During this time, she was a Democrat who supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.
Neal met British writer Roald Dahl at a dinner party hosted by Lillian Hellman in 1952, while Dahl was living in New York. They married on July 2, 1953, at Trinity Church in New York. The marriage produced five children.
*Olivia Twenty (1955–1962)
*Chantal Sophia &quot;Tessa&quot; (born 1957) (mother of Sophie Dahl)
*Theo Matthew (born 1960)
*Ophelia Magdalena (born 1964)
*Lucy Neal (born 1965)

On December 5, 1960, their son Theo, four months old, suffered brain damage when his baby carriage was struck by a taxicab in New York City. In May 1961, the family returned to Gipsy House in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, where Theo continued his rehabilitation. Neal described the two years of family life during Theo&#x27;s recovery as one of the most beautiful periods of her life. However, on November 17, 1962, their daughter Olivia died at age 7 from measles encephalitis. The story of Olivia&#x27;s death and how Neal and Dahl coped with the tragedy was dramatized in 2020 as a made-for-TV movie, &quot;To Olivia&quot;.

Neal was a heavy smoker. She suffered three burst cerebral aneurysms while pregnant in 1965 and was in a coma for three weeks. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine ran an obituary, but she survived with the assistance of Dahl and a number of volunteers who developed a gruelling style of therapy which fundamentally changed the way that stroke patients were treated. This period of their lives was dramatised in the television film &quot;The Patricia Neal Story&quot; (1981), in which the couple was played by Glenda Jackson and Dirk Bogarde. 
On August 4, 1965, Neal gave birth to a healthy daughter. She subsequently relearned to walk and talk, and after her recovery, was nominated for an Oscar for her 1968 performance in &quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot;.

In 1983, following Dahl&#x27;s 11-year affair with Felicity D&#x27;Abreu, a set designer he met when she worked with Neal on a Maxim Coffee advertisement, Neal&#x27;s marriage ended in divorce. She returned to live in the US. In her autobiography, &quot;As I Am&quot; (1988), Neal wrote: &quot;A strong positive mental attitude will create more miracles than any wonder drug.&quot;

==Death==
Neal died at her home in Edgartown, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts, on August 8, 2010, from lung cancer. She was 84 years old.

She had become a Catholic four months before she died and was buried in the Abbey of Regina Laudis in Bethlehem, Connecticut, where the actress Dolores Hart, her friend since the early 1960s, had become a nun and ultimately prioress. Neal had been a longtime supporter of the abbey&#x27;s open-air theatre and arts program.
==Legacy==
In 1978, Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center in Knoxville dedicated the Patricia Neal Rehabilitation Center in her honor. The center provides intense treatment for stroke, spinal cord, and brain injury patients. It serves as part of Neal&#x27;s advocacy for paralysis victims. She regularly visited the center in Knoxville, providing encouragement to its patients and staff. Neal appeared as the center&#x27;s spokeswoman in advertisements until her death.

<doc id="210216" wikidata="Q1171366" url="?curid=210216" title="The L-Shaped Room">
<text>The L-Shaped Room is a 1962 British drama romance film directed by Bryan Forbes, based on the 1960 novel of the same name by Lynne Reid Banks. It tells the story of Jane Fosset, a young French woman, unmarried and pregnant, who moves into a cheap London boarding house, befriending a young man, Toby, in the building. The work is considered part of the kitchen sink realism school of British drama. The film reflected a trend in British films of greater frankness about sex and displays a sympathetic treatment of outsiders &quot;unmarried mothers, lesbian or black&quot; as well as a &quot;largely natural and non-judgmental handling of their problems&quot;. As director, Forbes represents &quot;a more romantic, wistful type of realism&quot; than that of Tony Richardson or Lindsay Anderson.

Caron&#x27;s performance earned her the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for best actress, as well as a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Cicely Courtneidge gave what she considered her finest film performance, in a role wholly unlike her usual parts; she played an elderly lesbian, living in a drab London flat with her cat, recalling her career as an actress and forlornly trying to keep in touch with former friends. &quot;The Times&quot; described her performance as a triumph. For Bell, the film marked his breakthrough as a leading actor in film and television.

==Plot==

A 27-year-old French woman, Jane Fosset, arrives alone at a run down boarding house in Notting Hill, London, moving into an L-shaped room in the attic. Beautiful but withdrawn, she encounters the residents of her house, each a social outsider in his or her own way, including a gay, black trumpeter.

Jane is pregnant and has no desire to marry the father. On her first visit to a doctor, she wants to find out if she really is pregnant and consider her options. The doctor&#x27;s assumption that she must want either marriage or an abortion annoys her to the extent that Jane determines to have the child. She and Toby start a romance which is disrupted when he learns that she is pregnant by a previous lover. They try to work things out but he is also unhappy with his lack of income or success as a writer.

==Music==
Peter Katin&#x27;s recording of Johannes Brahms&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor, Op. 15 with orchestra conducted by Muir Mathieson is used as the background music, and excerpts occur frequently throughout the film. The original film score for the jazz club scene was composed by John Barry.

==Reception==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;Although it is full of the trappings of contemporary frustration ... the film has nothing specific to say about life in a London bedsitter in 1962. Despite his cogently amusing dialogue, Bryan Forbes&#x27; rather capricious direction makes this only too clear quite early on, for after a brilliantly authentic piece of scene setting, with the unseen landlady&#x27;s spine-chilling small talk on the stairs and the lights going out on each landing of the hideous house, he disappointingly spills over into melodrama – bugs in the bed, bangings on the wall, black face at the window. ... Moreover, neither direction nor script is ever tough enough to succeed in suggesting loneliness, and Forbes&#x27; obvious talent (and preference) for drawing likeable performances from his actors tends to work against him. Avis Bunnage&#x27;s unpredictable landlady, Cicely Courtneidge&#x27;s self-contained old trouper, Patricia Phoenix&#x27;s gregarious prostitute ... are all &quot;characters&quot;. Emlyn Williams&#x27; unprincipled gynaecologist is a cardboard villain. On the other hand, Leslie Caron has never been more appealing ... and Tom Bell exactly hits off frustrated attitudes of a would-be intellectual who cannot afford a bottle of non-vintage wine, let alone a wife with child. Indeed, when the film is soberly engaged in telling a simple, romantic story, it does achieve a certain assurance as well as considerable charm. There are scenes, like the one when Toby fails to turn up at the café, when music, camerawork and acting pull together on a genuinely elegiac note. In this context, too, one likes the film for its inherent wholesomeness.&quot;

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther wrote &quot;[Leslie Caron] pours into this role so much powerful feeling, so much heart and understanding, that she imbues a basically threadbare little story with tremendous compassion and charm. The credit, however, is not all Miss Caron&#x27;s. She must share it with an excellent cast, including Tom Bell, a new actor who plays the writer on a par with her. Particularly she must share it with the remarkable young director Bryan Forbes, who also wrote the screenplay from a novel by Lynne Reid Banks. Mr Forbes is a sometime actor whose first directorial job was last year&#x27;s beautiful and sensitive &quot;Whistle Down the Wind.&quot; In this little picture, he has achieved much the same human quality, with shadings of spiritual devotion, as in that.&quot;

<doc id="210219" wikidata="Q387370" url="?curid=210219" title="Irma la Douce">
<text>Irma la Douce (, &quot;Irma the Sweet&quot;) is a 1963 American romantic comedy film directed by Billy Wilder from a screenplay he co-wrote with I. A. L. Diamond, based on the 1956 French stage musical of the same name by Marguerite Monnot and Alexandre Breffort. The film stars Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine.

==Plot==
Nestor Patou, an honest policeman, has been transferred from the Bois de Boulogne to Les Halles, a more urban neighborhood in Paris. He finds a street full of prostitutes working at the Hotel Casanova and raids the place. The inspector fires Nestor, who is mistakenly framed for bribery.

Kicked off the force and humiliated, Nestor finds himself drawn to the very neighborhood that ended his career with the Paris police—returning to Chez Moustache, a popular tavern for prostitutes and pimps. Down on his luck, Nestor befriends Irma la Douce, a popular prostitute. He reluctantly accepts, as a confidant, the proprietor of Chez Moustache, a man known only as Moustache. In a running joke, Moustache tells of a storied prior life, claiming to have been, among other things, an attorney, a colonel in the Foreign Legion, and a doctor who worked with Albert Schweitzer in Africa, ending with the repeated line, &quot;but that&#x27;s another story&quot;. After saving Irma from her abusive pimp, Hippolyte, Nestor moves in with her, and unwittingly becomes a new one.

Nestor becomes infatuated and devises a plan to derail Irma&#x27;s life as a prostitute. With the help of Moustache, Nestor disguises himself as Lord X, a wealthy English lord, who becomes Irma&#x27;s exclusive client. Lord X has supposedly been rendered impotent by his service in World War II but is eager to support her in exchange for two visits each week. To finance Lord X&#x27;s expensive habit, Nestor takes graveyard shifts in the marketplace; missing all night and tired all day, Irma suspects an affair.

Irma seduces Lord X and persuades him to take her to England. At that point, Nestor decides to end the charade and kill off his alter ego. Unaware he is being tailed by Hippolyte, he tosses his disguise into the Seine. Seeing Lord X&#x27;s clothes floating in the water, Hippolyte concludes Nestor killed him.

Arrested and sent to prison, Nestor escapes when he discovers that Irma is pregnant. He narrowly avoids being recaptured when the police search for him at the apartment; donning his old uniform, Nestor blends in with the other police and eludes capture.

With the help of Hippolyte, Nestor arranges for the police to search for him along the Seine, from which he emerges dressed as Lord X. Exonerated of the murder, Nestor and Irma agree to get married. At the church, Irma goes into labor and has their baby. Moustache identifies the real Lord X as a guest. As Lord X leaves, a clearly baffled Moustache looks at the audience.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was conceived in 1962 as a vehicle for Marilyn Monroe. The project would have reunited her with Wilder and Lemmon, both of whom had worked with her on &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;. After Monroe&#x27;s death, Shirley MacLaine was cast in the film after starring in &quot;The Apartment&quot;. MacLaine was paid $350,000 plus a percentage.

While the film was mostly shot at the Samuel Goldwyn Studio in Hollywood, some exteriors were shot around Paris: Les Halles, the church of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, and the banks of the Seine.

==Reception==
The film was successful, grossing $25,246,588 in the United States and Canada on a budget of $5 million. It was the fifth highest-grossing film of 1963, earning an estimated $12 million in rentals in the United States and Canada. &quot;Irma la Douce&quot; earned over $15 million in worldwide rentals, but because of profit participation for Wilder and the two stars, United Artists only made a profit of $440,000 during the film&#x27;s theatrical run. It was the most popular film of all time in the Netherlands with admissions of 3.6 million.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a brisk and bubbly film&quot; with Lemmon &quot;little short of brilliant&quot; and MacLaine having &quot;a wonderously casual and candid air that sweeps indignation before it and leaves one sweetly enamoured of her.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; praised the &quot;scintillating performances&quot; by Lemmon and MacLaine but thought that the film &quot;lacks the originality of some of Wilder&#x27;s recent efforts&quot; and that the 147-minute running time was &quot;an awfully long haul for a frivolous farce.&quot; Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that &quot;I found it a brilliant, though outrageously outspoken comedy.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; panned the film as &quot;overblown and overlong, two hours and three quarters tediously spent on a single joke.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Though the film stretches for two and a third hours, and rarely ventures away from the two principals and the studio-built Rue Casanova, the humour and spontaneity endure surprisingly well ... most credit goes to Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon for yet another &quot;tour de force&quot; of comedy playing.&quot; The film has a rating of 76% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews.

<doc id="210222" wikidata="Q254828" url="?curid=210222" title="Rachel Roberts (actress)">
<text>Rachel Roberts (20 September 192726 November 1980) was a British actress. She is best remembered for her screen performances as the older mistress of the central male characters in both &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; (1960) and &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; (1963). For each, she won the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress. She was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for &quot;This Sporting Life&quot;. Her other notable film appearances included &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974), &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; (1975) and &quot;Yanks&quot; (1979).

Roberts&#x27; theatre credits included the original production of the musical &quot;Maggie May&quot; in 1964. She was nominated for the 1974 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for the plays, &quot;Chemin de Fer&quot; and &quot;The Visit&quot;, and won a Drama Desk Award in 1976 for &quot;Habeas Corpus&quot;.

== Early life and career ==
Roberts was born in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, Wales. After a Baptist upbringing (against which she rebelled), followed by study at the University of Wales and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, she began working with a repertory company in Swansea in 1950. She made her film debut in the Welsh-set comedy &quot;Valley of Song&quot; (1953), directed by Gilbert Gunn.

Her portrayal of Brenda in Karel Reisz&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; (1960) won her a British Academy Film Award. Lindsay Anderson cast her as the suffering Mrs Hammond in &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; (1963), earning her another BAFTA and an Oscar nomination. Both films were significant examples of the British New Wave of film-making.

In theatre, she performed at the Royal Court and played the title role as the life-enhancing prostitute in Lionel Bart&#x27;s musical &quot;Maggie May&quot; (1964). In films, she continued to play women with lusty appetites as in Lindsay Anderson&#x27;s &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; (1973), although the haunting Australian-made &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; (1975), directed by Peter Weir, provided her with a different kind of role, as the authoritarian head teacher of a Victorian girls&#x27; school.

After relocating to Los Angeles in the early 1970s, she appeared in supporting roles in several American films such as &quot;Foul Play&quot; (1978). Her final British film was &quot;Yanks&quot; (1979), directed by John Schlesinger, for which she received a Supporting Actress BAFTA.

In 1976, she won a Drama Desk Award for her performance in Alan Bennett&#x27;s play &quot;Habeas Corpus&quot;. In 1979, Roberts co-starred with Jill Bennett in the London Weekend Television production of Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;The Old Crowd&quot;, directed by Lindsay Anderson and Stephen Frears.

==Personal life==
Roberts was married twice and had no children. She first married actor Alan Dobie in 1955. They divorced in 1960. The following year, Roberts married actor Rex Harrison in Genoa, Italy. The marriage was tumultuous; Roberts and Harrison both drank excessively and engaged in public fights. Harrison later left Roberts and they divorced in 1971. Later that year, Harrison married British socialite Elizabeth Rees-Williams, Roberts&#x27; former best friend.

Roberts was known in the entertainment industry for the eccentric behaviour that stemmed from her alcoholism. She had a habit of imitating a Welsh Corgi when intoxicated and once, at a party thrown by Richard Harris, attacked actor Robert Mitchum on all fours, chewing his trousers and chomping on his bare skin, while he patted her on the head, saying &quot;there, there&quot;. In diary entries from June 1967, Richard Burton describes a visit from the Harrisons where &quot;Rachel became stupendously drunk and was or became totally uncontrollable...She insulted Rex sexually, morally, physically and in every way. She lay on the floor in the bar and barked like a dog. At one time she started to masturbate her basset hound - a lovely sloppy old dog called Omar.&quot; At the time of her death, Roberts was intermittently with Darren Ramirez, a Mexican almost 20 years younger. It was a largely platonic relationship. In her final years she became obsessed with rekindling her relationship with Harrison.

==Death==
Rachel Roberts was devastated by her divorce from Rex Harrison, and her alcoholism and depression worsened. She moved to Hollywood in 1975 and tried to forget the relationship. In 1980, Roberts attempted to reconcile with Harrison, but he was married to his sixth and final wife, Mercia Tinker.

On 26 November 1980, Rachel Roberts died at her home in Los Angeles at the age of 53. Her death was initially attributed to a heart attack. Her gardener found her body on her kitchen floor, lying amidst shards of glass; she had fallen through a decorative glass divide between two rooms. An autopsy later determined that her death was a result of swallowing lye or another alkali, or another unidentified caustic substance, as well as barbiturates and alcohol, as detailed in her posthumously published journals. The corrosive effect of the alkali was the immediate cause of death. The coroner documented the cause of death as &quot;swallowing a caustic substance&quot; and, later, &quot;acute barbiturate intoxication.&quot; Her death was ruled a suicide.

Roberts was cremated at the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles. Her journals became the basis for &quot;No Bells on Sunday: The Memoirs of Rachel Roberts&quot;, published in 1984.

In 1992, Roberts&#x27; ashes, along with those of her friend Jill Bennett, who committed suicide in 1990, were scattered on the River Thames in London by director Lindsay Anderson during a boat trip, with several of the two actresses&#x27; professional colleagues and friends aboard; musician Alan Price sang &quot;Is That All There Is?&quot; The event was included as a segment in Anderson&#x27;s BBC documentary film, also titled &quot;Is That All There Is?&quot;.

<text>The Lower Canada Rebellion (), commonly referred to as the Patriots&#x27; Rebellion () in French, is the name given to the armed conflict in 1837–38 between rebels and the colonial government of Lower Canada (now southern Quebec). Together with the simultaneous rebellion in the neighbouring colony of Upper Canada (now southern Ontario), it formed the Rebellions of 1837–38 ().

As a result of the rebellions, the Province of Canada was created from the former Lower Canada and Upper Canada.

== History ==
The rebellion had been preceded by nearly three decades of efforts at political reform in Lower Canada, led from the early 1800s by James Stuart and Louis-Joseph Papineau, who formed the Parti patriote and sought accountability from the elected general assembly and the appointed governor of the colony. After the Constitutional Act 1791, Lower Canada could elect a House of Assembly, which led to the rise of two parties: the English Party and the Canadian Party. The English Party was mostly composed of the English merchants and bourgeoisie and had the support of bureaucrats and the old seigneurial families. The Canadian Party was formed by aristocrats, French or English. The Catholic Church did not openly advocate for any political party but tended to support the English party. With the power in the hand of the population, the French-Canadian business class needed support from the population more than from the British business class. Since the population was mostly French-Canadian, those elected to the House of Assembly tended to be French-speaking and to support the French-Canadian business class. The House of Assembly gave an illusion of power to French-Canadians, but the Executive and Legislative Councils advised the governor, who could veto any legislation. Both councils were made of people chosen by the English party. The appointed legislative council was dominated by a small group of businessmen known as the Château Clique, the equivalent of the Family Compact in Upper Canada.

In the early 19th century the economy of Lower Canada changed drastically. Logging became more important than agriculture and the fur trade, which worried those who worked in the fields. Activists in Lower Canada began to work for reform of the economic disfranchisement of the French-speaking majority and working-class English-speaking citizens. The rebellion opposed the colonial government&#x27;s appointed upper house of the legislature. Many of those appointed were English-speaking. French speakers felt that English-speakers were disproportionately represented in the lucrative fields of banking, timber, and transportation.

Sir James Henry Craig, governor from 1807 to 1812, encountered multiple crises. He called elections three times in 16 months because he was not satisfied with the people elected even though they kept being re-elected. Craig thought that the Canadian Party and its supporters wanted a French-Canadian republic, and feared that if the United States invaded Lower Canada, the Canadian Party would collaborate. In 1810, Craig imprisoned journalists working for the &quot;Le Canadien&quot; newspaper, in particular Pierre-Stanislas Bédard, the leader of the Canadian Party and editor of the newspaper. That created a leadership crisis in the party.

During the War of 1812 many rumours circulated in the colony of a possible invasion. The French-Canadians depended on the protection of Britain, which created a certain unity in the colony during wartime.

At the same time, some among the English-speaking business elite advocated a union of Upper and Lower Canada to ensure competitiveness with the increasingly-large and powerful economy of the United States, while some rebels were inspired by the success of the American War of Independence. The British-appointed governor, George Ramsey, Earl of Dalhousie, favoured unification. In Lower Canada, the growing sense of nationalism among English- and the French-speaking citizens was organized into the Parti canadien, which, after 1826, was called the parti patriote.
In 1811, James Stuart became leader of the Parti canadien in the assembly and in 1815, reformer Louis-Joseph Papineau was elected as speaker. The elected assembly had little power since its decisions could be vetoed by either the legislative council and the governor, appointed by the British government. Dalhousie and Papineau were soon at odds over the issue of uniting the Canadas. Dalhousie forced an election in 1827, rather than accept Papineau as assembly speaker. Dalhousie mistakenly hoped that the elected members would change and then decided to prorogue the parliament. The population reacted by sending a petition signed by 87,000 people to London against Dalhousie. Reformers in England had Dalhousie reassigned to India, but the legislative council and the assembly were still unable to reach a compromise.

From 1828 to 1832, there was a brief calm, and the assembly was able to pass several important laws. In 1832, the Patriote newspapers published controversial articles about the Legislative Council, and both heads of the newspapers got arrested. That created a huge tension in the population against the British government, especially when the army shot three people in a crowd during a Montreal by-election in 1832 and nobody was arrested.

After hearing about the 99 grievances submitted by Robert Gourlay, Papineau wrote the &quot;Ninety-two Resolutions&quot; while he was secretly co-ordinating with Upper Canada. After protestors were shot in Montreal in 1832, Papineau had to submit the list of &quot;resolutions&quot; to the governor himself. The document that was presented to the House of Assembly on January 7, 1834, and had 92 demands to the British government. By 1834, the assembly had passed the Ninety-two Resolutions, outlining its grievances against the legislative council. The goal was to group all together, in a single document, the people&#x27;s grievances. It was addressed to the British government to tell it the problems of the colony. The Patriotes were supported by an overwhelming majority of Lower Canada&#x27;s population of all origins. There were popular gatherings all around the colony to sign a petition that was sent to London to show that the document was popular. In 1834, the Parti patriote swept the election by gaining more than three quarters of the popular vote.

When London received the resolutions, they asked Governor Lord Gosford to analyze it. At first, he was trying to attract the Patriotes away from Papineau and his influence. However, the same governor created a loyal militia made of volunteers to fight the Patriotes. In 1836, the government was able to vote some subsidies to the administration during the assembly because the assembly members from the City of Quebec decided to go against Papineau. The period of calm did not last long because a month later, Papineau found Gosford&#x27;s secret instructions, which said that the British never planned on accepting the resolutions.

However, the reformers in Lower Canada were divided over several issues. A moderate reformer, John Neilson, had quit the party in 1830 and joined the Constitutional Association four years later. Papineau&#x27;s anticlerical position alienated reformers in the Catholic Church, and his support for secular, rather than religious, schools resulted in opposition by the powerful Bishop, Jean-Jacques Lartigue, who called on all Catholics to reject the reform movement and to support the authorities, forcing many to choose between their religion and their political convictions.

In 1837, the Russell resolutions rejected all of the Patriotes&#x27; resolutions and gave the right to the governor to take subsidies without voting in the assembly. It also said that the legislative council would continue to be chosen by the Crown. The Russell Resolutions were adopted in Westminster by a huge majority.

==Organizing for armed conflict==
Papineau continued to push for reform. He petitioned the British government, but in March 1837 the administration of Lord Melbourne rejected all of Papineau&#x27;s requests. After the Russell Resolutions were announced, the Patriotes used their newspapers to organize popular gatherings to inform people about their positions. They encouraged people to boycott British produce and illegally import goods from the United States. The gatherings took place all over Lower Canada, and thousands participated. Papineau attended most gatherings in the summer of 1837, to ensure that people would pressure the government only by political measures, such as the boycott of British produce.

Governor Gosford tried to forbid those gatherings but they were attended even by those loyal to him. At the end of the summer, many of Gosford&#x27;s local representatives quit, in a show of support for the Patriotes. Gosford hired loyal people and tried to gain the Patriotes&#x27; trust by appointing seven French-Canadian members to the Legislative Assembly. In September and October 1837, a group of more radical Patriotes tried to intimidate the colonial government by going out into the street and rioting near the homes of certain loyalists. At the end of October, the largest of the Patriotes&#x27; gatherings took place in Saint-Charles, led by Wolfred Nelson. It lasted for two days and formed &quot;La Confédération des Six-Comtés&quot;.

Papineau organized protests and assemblies and eventually approved formation of the paramilitary &quot;Société des Fils de la Liberté&quot; during the &quot;assemblée des six-comtés&quot;. In his last speech before the armed conflict, Papineau said that it was not yet time to fight. He thought that political actions could still avoid fighting. Wolfred Nelson made a speech immediately afterwards, saying that he disagreed with Papineau and thought that it was time to fight. After the &quot;Assemblée des Six-Comtés&quot;, the Patriotes were divided between supporters of Papineau and supporters of Nelson. On the other side, the supporters of the Russell Resolutions called a Constitutional Association led by Peter McGill and John Molson, and held gatherings around the province calling for government troops to return order to the colony.

On November 6, 1837, &quot;Les Fils de la Liberté&quot; were holding a meeting in Montreal, when the Doric Club began fighting with them and violence and vandalism broke out everywhere in the city of Montreal. Arrest warrants were issued for those responsible for the leaders of the Assemblée des Six-Comtés. The first armed conflict occurred in 1837 when the 26 members of the Patriotes who had been charged with illegal activities chose to resist their arrest by the authorities under the direction of John Colborne. Arrest warrants against Papineau and other assembly members were issued. They left Montréal and hid in the countryside. Papineau escaped to the United States, and other rebels organized in the countryside.

On November 16, Constable Malo was sent to arrest three Patriotes. He transported them from Saint-Jean, accompanied by 15 people. The prisoners were liberated in Longueuil, where 150 Patriotes were waiting for them. The victory significantly improved the morale of the Patriotes, who knew that this event meant that government troops would soon intervene. However, the Patriotes were not quite ready to fight regular soldiers. Led by Wolfred Nelson, they defeated a government force at the Battle of Saint-Denis on November 23, 1837. He had 800 people ready to fight, half of them equipped with firearms. With confidence among the Patriote supporters wavering, Nelson threatened them to make sure that they would not leave. Papineau was not there during the fight, which surprised many people.

Government troops soon beat back the rebels, defeating them at Saint-Charles on November 25 and at Saint-Eustache on December 14, burning a rebel outpost after their second victory. On December 5, the government declared martial law in Montreal. At the Battle of Saint-Charles, the Patriotes were defeated. General Brown was confident but was not a capable commander. There was no discipline in the camp. Different people offered him men, but he turned down all the offers. Once the battle started, Brown escaped the fight. After the Battle of Saint-Charles, Nelson tried to keep Saint-Denis safe, but knew there was no hope. The main leaders, including Papineau, O&#x27;Callaghan, and Nelson, left for the United States. The last battle of the rebellions was the Battle of Saint-Eustache. When the battle came, on December 14, 1837, there were between 500 and 600 people ready to fight. The government forces were expecting strong resistance and so had brought 2,000 men. Most Patriote leaders were killed or fled during the battle. The Battle of Saint-Eustache was a significant defeat. The defeat of the rebellions can be explained by the fact that the Patriotes were not quite ready to fight.

When news of the arrest of the Patriote leaders reached Upper Canada, William Lyon Mackenzie launched an armed rebellion in December 1837. After the insurrection, the government prepared for another armed conflict. It reorganized the whole organization, mostly in the urban areas like Montréal and Quebec. The government had 5,000 regular troops stationed in Lower Canada, and knew that the leaders of the Patriote movement were in the United States, so the government maintained contact with spies in the United States, and the American government kept their British counterparts informed of rebel activity. In February 1838, rebel leaders who had escaped across the border into the United States raided Lower Canada. During the summer of 1838, the Patriotes in the United States formed a secret society, called &quot;Frères chasseurs,&quot; to invade Lower Canada from the United States. The secret group also had members in Lower Canada itself, who would assist in the invasion. The goal was an independent state of Lower Canada.

Two major armed conflicts occurred when groups of Lower Canadian Patriotes, led by Robert Nelson, crossed the Canada–U.S. border in an attempt to invade Lower Canada and Upper Canada, overthrow the colonial government, and establish two independent republics. A second revolt began with the Battle of Beauharnois in November 1838, which was also suppressed by the British. The &quot;Frères Chasseurs&quot; had camps around Lower Canada, in which they were arming themselves. Their main camp was in Napierville. They had many participants but not enough weapons. They planned to take control of the road between the United States and Napierville, but were intercepted by volunteers. The &quot;Frères Chasseurs&quot; were defeated in 30 minutes. Shortly afterward, Robert Nelson and other members came from Napierville to take control of the same area. However, volunteers were already waiting and had help from the Loyal Rangers of Clarenceville. This time, the battle lasted longer, but the &quot;Frères Chasseurs&quot; were ultimately defeated. Then, three secondary camps were scattered very easily by armed volunteers.

Most Patriotes left the camps when they heard government forces approaching, and the latter were ultimately barely involved in the second uprising of the Patriotes. The British government subsequently dispatched Lord Durham to investigate the cause of the rebellion. His report in 1839 recommended that the Canadas be united into one colony (the Province of Canada) to assimilate the French-speaking Canadiens into English Canadian culture. For Durham, the fact that there were two groups (English and French) created a hostile environment. He thought that the way to solve to problems in Lower Canada was to assimilate the French-Canadians. He also recommended accepting the rebels&#x27; grievances by granting responsible government to the new colony.

== Aftermath ==

After the first insurrection, the Pied-du-Courant Prison in Montreal was overfull. In July, Durham emptied it. When hostilities resumed in 1838, the prison filled with even more prisoners. Martial law was declared. This allowed the government to imprison people without reason. Ninety-nine prisoners from the second rebellion were sentenced to death. Twelve were hanged; the last hanging is dramatized in the 2001 film &quot;February 15, 1839&quot;. The government feared that the populace would sympathize with the prisoners. So, 141 prisoners from Lower and Upper Canada were instead sent to work camps in Australia. In Sydney two bays are named for Canadian internment camps for convicts involved in
the Lower Canada Rebellion - Exile Bay and France Bay. In 1844, they were allowed to return. Although they had to pay for their fare home, most had returned by 1845.

After the military defeat of the Patriotes, Lower Canada was merged with Upper Canada under the Act of Union, passed by the British Parliament. The Canadiens had a narrow majority in the new province, but with continued emigration of English-speakers to Canada West, that dominance was short lived. Eight years after the Union, the coalition between Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine and Robert Baldwin achieved elected responsible government in the Province of Canada. The instability of this new regime (see Joint Premiers of the Province of Canada) eventually led to the formation of the Great Coalition. 1867 brought another major constitutional change and the formation of the Canadian Confederation.

Joseph Schull, author of a book on the rebellion, once said: 

The Lower Canada Rebellion, along with the Upper Canadian Rebellion, is often seen as an example of what might have occurred in the United States if the American Revolutionary War had failed. In Quebec, the rebellion, as well as the parliamentary and popular struggle, is now commemorated as the Journée nationale des Patriotes (National Patriots&#x27; Day) on the Canadian statutory holiday, Victoria Day. Since the late 20th century, the day has become a symbol for the Quebec independence movement and, to a lesser extent, a symbol of Canada&#x27;s small republican movement.

<doc id="210224" wikidata="Q616491" url="?curid=210224" title="Love with the Proper Stranger">
<text>Love with the Proper Stranger is a 1963 American romantic drama film made by Pakula-Mulligan Productions and Boardwalk Productions and released by Paramount Pictures. It was directed by Robert Mulligan and produced by Alan J. Pakula from a screenplay by Arnold Schulman.

The film stars Natalie Wood, Steve McQueen, Edie Adams, Herschel Bernardi and Harvey Lembeck. The film also marked the screen debut of Tom Bosley and features a brief, uncredited appearance by the director&#x27;s younger brother Richard Mulligan, who later became a well-known television actor. The film received five Academy Award nominations including Best Actress (for Wood).

The film addresses themes of abortion, norms of conventional marriage and adulthood.

==Plot==
The film tells the story of first generation Italian, Angie Rossini, a salesclerk at Macy&#x27;s department store who finds herself pregnant after a one-night stand with part-time musician Rocky Papasano. When she confronts him at a mass audition at Carnegie Hall, he claims to not remember her. Her only request is that Rocky help fund and find the name of a doctor who is willing to perform an abortion. Meanwhile, Angie is being pressured by her working-class older brothers to marry Anthony, an unappealing but successful restaurateur.

Rocky and Angie scrape up enough money for the abortion but are confronted by Angie&#x27;s brothers, who chase them through the neighborhood. Rocky is able to sneak into a friend&#x27;s warehouse, where the two discuss life, their mistakes and future prospects. When he and Angie meet the crude abortion-care provider in a dubious part of the New York City Meatpacking District (who turns out not to be a doctor but a back-room abortionist), Rocky refuses to let her go through with the dangerous procedure, much to the relief of Angie, who rests from the trauma in Rocky&#x27;s ex-girlfriend&#x27;s apartment. The maturity he shows in doing this brings them closer, and Angie grows to respect him. After meeting her brothers, Rocky (who was given the requisite black eye by the oldest brother) decides to &quot;take his medicine&quot; by agreeing to marry her. Angie, who has more romantic aspirations in life, is insulted by the insinuation of marriage-by-duty and refuses. Angie wants romance, with &quot;bells and banjos&quot;.

As an act of independence, Angie moves out of her family home, much to the chagrin of her immigrant mother. She begins dating the restaurateur, Anthony, who offers to marry her (and claim the baby as his own). By acting aloof, she confuses and attracts Rocky back to Macy&#x27;s, where he inquires about her condition. When Rocky mentions marriage once again, Angie invites him to &quot;just come over for dinner&quot; at her apartment. The dinner is structured as a &quot;date night&quot; with a well-prepared meal and cocktails. Rocky is impressed with her ability as a homemaker, but even more impressed by her well-dressed and sexy appearance. After two stiff drinks, he makes crude advances on her and is rejected yet again. Angie says she does not want to make the same mistake again, citing the &quot;bells and banjos&quot; she expects in her relationships, and that after all the time spent together, she actually &quot;likes him&quot;. They quarrel, and the sobbing Angie throws him out of the apartment, slamming the door. The next day, Rocky wins her heart by waiting for her outside the crowded Macy&#x27;s, holding the sign, &quot;Better Wed Than Dead&quot;, ringing bells and playing a banjo.

<doc id="210227" wikidata="Q2257188" url="?curid=210227" title="The Pumpkin Eater">
<text>The Pumpkin Eater is a 1964 British drama film directed by Jack Clayton and starring Anne Bancroft and Peter Finch. The film was adapted by Harold Pinter from the 1962 novel of the same title by Penelope Mortimer. The title is a reference to the nursery rhyme &quot;Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater&quot;.

== Plot ==
The film&#x27;s narrative revolves around Jo Armitage, a woman with an ambiguous number of children from three marriages, who becomes negative and withdrawn after discovering that her third (and current) husband, Jake, has been unfaithful to her. After a series of loosely related events in which Jake&#x27;s infidelity is balanced by his reliability as a breadwinner and a father, Jo and Jake take a first tentative step toward reconciliation.

Thematically, there are two issues: Jo&#x27;s frequent childbearing and Jake&#x27;s extramarital affairs. The question of Jo&#x27;s fertility is first broached by her psychiatrist. He suggests that she may feel uncomfortable with the messiness or vulgarity of sex and that she may be using childbirth to justify it to herself. This does not prevent her from becoming pregnant again, but she follows suggestions by Jake and her doctor that she have an abortion and be sterilized, and she seems happy after the operation.

Meanwhile, signs accumulate that Jake has been having affairs while pursuing a successful career as a screenwriter. The first indication of his infidelity concerns Philpot, a young woman who lived with the Armitage family for a while. Jake reacts irrationally and unconvincingly to Jo&#x27;s questions after the children tell her the woman fainted into Jake&#x27;s arms. The second sign comes from Bob Conway, an acquaintance who alleges an affair between his wife and Jake during production of a film in Morocco. Finally, Jake admits some of his infidelities under heated interrogation by Jo. After venting her frustration by furiously assaulting him, she retaliates by having an affair with her second husband. This elicits coldness from Jake.

In the film&#x27;s finale, Jo spends a night alone in a windmill (near the converted barn she had lived in with her second husband and children) that the couple has been renovating. The following morning, Jake and their children arrive at the windmill with food. Seeing how happy her children are with Jake, Jo indicates her acceptance of him sadly, but graciously, accepting a tin of beer from him, a gesture which echoes another scene in the windmill from a happier time in their marriage.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote &quot;Though &quot;Pumpkin Eater&quot; in outline resembles a compendium of womanly woes, it plays like a house afire, almost invariably ignited by actress Bancroft, who could probably strike dramatic lightning from a recitation of tide tables...And her spectacular scenes with Finch, pitched against the din of a more or less anonymous army of progeny, are a litany of love, hate, lies, jealousy and excruciating domestic boredom.&quot; 

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;[Pinter&#x27;s] script vividly brings to life the principal characters in this story of a shattered marriage, though Pinter&#x27;s resort to flashback technique is confusing in the early stages. Jack Clayton&#x27;s direction gets off to a slow, almost casual start, but the pace quickens as the drama becomes more intense. He has used the considerable acting talents at his command for the maximum results.&quot;

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was critical of Pinter&#x27;s script, and Clayton&#x27;s direction, which he felt was &quot;somewhat mechanical, too, tumbling his drama in a confusion of jump cuts and fleeting images...With a good deal more body to the drama and point to the characters, Mr. Clayton would have a picture that comes close to representing truth.&quot; 

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; stated &quot;There is something phantasmally absurd about this well-meaning, ambitious film...It could well be that Pinter&#x27;s brilliance is altogether the wrong kind of brilliance to let loose on the scripting of this already nerve-raw, nightmarish subject. Jo...makes an eminently worthwhile, but virtually intractable, subject for a film: worthwhile because neurotics rarely get a square, sympathetic, penetrating deal in the cinema; intractable because, like many neurotics, she is a fixated and evidently crashing bore, and one of the most difficult things to do is to present a bore fairly without at the same time boring your audience too.&quot;

The film has continued to provoke comments. In a 1999 obituary of Penelope Mortimer, Giles Gordon in &quot;The Guardian&quot; characterized Harold Pinter as someone who values what is &quot;written between the lines,&quot; making him &quot;her ideal translator and interpreter&quot; for the film adaptation of Mortimer&#x27;s novel. 

In 2006, David Hare wrote that &quot;Pinter regularly offers actors what will become the opportunities of a lifetime: to Meryl Streep, obviously, in &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;; to Peter Finch and Anne Bancroft in one of the most overlooked of all British films, &quot;The Pumpkin Eater&quot;; and, unforgettably, to Dirk Bogarde, both in &quot;Accident&quot; and &quot;The Servant&quot;.&quot;

Of the capable supporting cast, Yootha Joyce as a psychotic young woman sitting opposite Bancroft under the hairdryers, delivered a performance that has been called by Clayton&#x27;s biographer one of the &quot;best screen acting miniatures one could hope to see.&quot;

<text>Marriage Italian Style ( ) is a 1964 romantic comedy-drama film directed by Vittorio De Sica, starring Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni.

The film was adapted by Leonardo Benvenuti, Renato Castellani, Piero De Bernardi, and Tonino Guerra from the play &quot;Filumena Marturano&quot; by Eduardo De Filippo. &quot;Filumena Marturano&quot; had previously been adapted as a 1950 Argentine film.

==Plot==
Set during the World War II era, the film follows a cynical but successful 28-year-old businessman named Domenico (Mastroianni), who, after meeting a naive 17-year-old country girl, Filumena (Loren), during a bombing outside a Neapolitan brothel, starts an on-again, off-again relationship spanning 22 years. From the very beginning, Filumena is deeply in love with Domenico, but her love is not reciprocated. After Filumena expresses her wish to be solely his woman, Domenico arranges a leased home for her, with Rosalie as a maid and Alfredo (Aldo Puglisi) as the butler, and arranges a job for her in his shop. He eventually takes her into his house as a semi-official mistress under the pretence that she is the niece of Carmela (his mother&#x27;s former maid) there to take care of his ailing, senile mother. Domenico&#x27;s mindset about Filumena&#x27;s past keeps him from taking their relationship seriously.

After falling for the 20-year-old cashier in his store, Domenico (now 50) plans to marry her. But he finds himself cornered when Filumena feigns illness and, while &quot;on her deathbed,&quot; asks him to marry her. Thinking she will be dead in a matter of hours and the marriage won&#x27;t even be registered, he agrees. After being proclaimed his legal bride, the shrewd and resourceful Filumena drops the charade of feigning death. This sends Domenico into a fit of rage, as he feels that Filumena tricked him for his money. But Filumena reveals the real reason for the marriage: she did it for the three children she had borne (Umberto, Riccardo, and Michele). As the children were coming of age, she wanted them to have Domenico&#x27;s family name.

Domenico won&#x27;t accept this and decides to contest the marriage. The law rules in his favour, and the marriage is annulled. Filumena accepts the annulment but tells Domenico that he had fathered one of the children. She does not say which one, as she considers all of them equal. However, she gives him a hint that his child was conceived on the night Domenico had said &quot;to pretend we are in love&quot; and had given her a 100-lira note, on which she had written the date and kept it in a locket ever since. She gives the note to Domenico, having torn off the corner containing the date. Domenico is visibly rattled by this revelation but can&#x27;t solve the clue.

Domenico tries desperately to figure out which child he had fathered. He visits the children at their workplaces and tries other means but hits a dead end.

He meets up with Filumena and tries to force an answer out of her, but she reveals nothing more. As a last resort, Domenico decides to confront the children directly, but Filumena vehemently opposes this, as the prospect of Domenico&#x27;s money would drive a wedge between the children. As Filumena and Domenico scuffle, they tumble down, fall into each other&#x27;s arms, and passionately kiss. They then declare their love for each other and decide to (re)marry.

At the church, the boys wait, and Domenico arrives. Domenico mentions that, because he will be marrying their mother, he will give them his name. He continues to prod them for clues but again comes out with nothing, as they each share some of his traits. Filumena rushes in; Domenico, smiling with joy, tells her how wonderful she looks, and the marriage takes place.

Back at home, the boys bid their mother goodnight. As, one after another, they say goodnight to Domenico calling him their father, he smiles broadly and says that he will see them tomorrow.

Filumena sits and weeps with joy at this. When Domenico asks why she is crying, she states that it feels wonderful to cry.

==Reception==
===Box office===
It was the second-highest-grossing Italian film in Italy for the year, behind only &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, with a gross of $3,725,000.

===Critical response===
The film was received favourably. &quot;Marriage Italian Style&quot; has an approval rating of 80% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 5 reviews, and an average rating of 8/10.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that it was the fourth quality collaboration between director Vittorio De Sica and Sophia Loren, and the second to include Marcello Mastroianni in the mix, with the &quot;warmup&quot; for this movie having been 1963&#x27;s &quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot;. The review described it as a &quot;wonderfully flamboyant&quot; film, and provided some context for the film, noting that Naples (at least in 1964) was &quot;a quite unusual place, where the people are highly individual and may have bizarre relationships&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
The film was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Actress in a Leading Role (for Loren) in 1964 and Best Foreign Language Film in 1965. It was also entered in the 4th Moscow International Film Festival in 1965.
