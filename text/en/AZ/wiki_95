<text>The Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in the City and Diocese of Washington, commonly known as Washington National Cathedral or National Cathedral, is a cathedral of the Episcopal Church. The cathedral is located in Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. The structure is of Neo-Gothic design closely modeled on English Gothic style of the late fourteenth century. It is the second-largest church building in the United States, and the third-tallest building in Washington, D.C. The cathedral is the seat of both the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church and the bishop of the Diocese of Washington. Over 270,000 people visit the structure annually.

The Protestant Episcopal Cathedral Foundation, under the first seven bishops of Washington, erected the cathedral under a charter passed by the United States Congress on January 6, 1893. Construction began on September 29, 1907, when the foundation stone was laid in the presence of President Theodore Roosevelt and a crowd of more than 20,000, and ended 83 years later when the &quot;final finial&quot; was placed in the presence of President George H. W. Bush on September 29, 1990. Decorative and restorative work, particularly of damage from a nearby earthquake in 2011, is ongoing The Foundation is the legal entity of which all institutions on the Cathedral Close are a part; its corporate staff provides services for the institutions to help enable their missions, conducts work of the Foundation itself that is not done by the other entities, and serves as staff for the board of trustees.

The cathedral stands at Massachusetts and Wisconsin Avenues in the northwest quadrant of Washington. It is an associate member of the inter-denominational Washington Theological Consortium. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2007, it was ranked third on the List of America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects.

==History==
===Construction===
In 1792, Pierre L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s &quot;Plan of the Federal City&quot; specified a site for a &quot;great church for national purposes&quot;. However he defined it as non-sectarian and nondenominational. Alexander Hamilton modified L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s plan and eliminated the &quot;church&quot; and several other proposed monuments and that plan was never reproduced. The working plan for the new city was subsequently produced by Andrew Ellicott and it varied in many respects from L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s. although the essence remained. The National Portrait Gallery now occupies that site. 

In 1891, a meeting was held to begin plans for an Episcopal cathedral in Washington. On January 6, 1893, the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral Foundation of the District of Columbia was granted a charter from Congress to establish the cathedral. The 52nd United States Congress declared in the act to incorporate the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral Foundation of the District of Columbia that the &quot;said corporation is hereby empowered to establish and maintain within the District of Columbia a cathedral and institutions of learning for the promotion of religion and education and charity.&quot; The commanding site on Mount Saint Alban was chosen. Henry Yates Satterlee, first Episcopal bishop of the Diocese of Washington, chose George Frederick Bodley, Britain&#x27;s leading Anglican church architect, as the head architect. Henry Vaughan was selected supervising architect.

Construction started on September 29, 1907, with a ceremonial address by President Theodore Roosevelt and the laying of the cornerstone. In 1912, Bethlehem Chapel opened for services in the unfinished cathedral, which have continued daily ever since. When construction of the cathedral resumed after a brief hiatus for World War I, both Bodley and Vaughan had died. Gen. John J. Pershing led fundraising efforts for the church after World War I. American architect Philip Hubert Frohman took over the design of the cathedral and was thenceforth designated the principal architect. Funding for Washington National Cathedral has come entirely from private sources. Maintenance and upkeep continue to rely entirely upon private support.
===National role===
From its earliest days, the cathedral has been promoted as more than simply an Episcopal cathedral. Planners hoped it would play a role similar to Westminster Abbey. They wanted it to be a national shrine and a venue for great services. For much of the cathedral&#x27;s history, this was captured in the phrase &quot;a house of prayer for all people.&quot; In more recent times the phrases &quot;national house of prayer&quot; and &quot;spiritual home for the nation&quot; have been used. The cathedral has achieved this status simply by offering itself and being accepted by religious and political leaders as playing this role.

Its initial charter was similar to those granted to American University, The Catholic University of America, and other not-for-profit entities founded in the District of Columbia . Contrary to popular misconception, the government has not designated it as a national house of prayer.

During World War II, monthly services were held there &quot;on behalf of a united people in a time of emergency.&quot; Before and since, the structure has hosted other major events, both religious and secular, that have drawn the attention of the American people, as well as tourists from around the world.

===2011 earthquake===

The cathedral was damaged in August 2011 during the Virginia earthquake. Finial stones on several pinnacles broke off, and several pinnacles twisted out of alignment or collapsed entirely. Some gargoyles and other carvings were damaged, and a hole was punched through the metal-clad roof by falling masonry. Cracks also appeared in the flying buttresses surrounding the apse. Inside, initial inspections revealed less damage, with some mortar joints loose or falling out. The cathedral, which had no earthquake insurance, struggled to cope with the cost of the damage.

Washington National Cathedral closed from August 24 to November 7, 2011, as $2 million was spent to stabilize the structure and remove damaged or loose stone. Safety netting was erected throughout the nave to protect visitors from any debris that might fall from above. The cathedral reopened for the consecration and installation of Mariann Budde as the ninth Bishop of Washington on November 12, 2011. At that time, estimates of the cost of the damage were about $25 million.

Identifying the full extent of the damage and construction planning and studies over the next two years consumed another $2.5 million. In 2011, the cathedral received a $700,000 preservation work matching grant from the Save America&#x27;s Treasures program, a public-private partnership operated by the nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation. The program, which is federally funded, required the cathedral to match the grant dollar-for-dollar with private funds and use the money solely for preservation work.

Although fundraising to repair the damage began soon after the earthquake, it took the cathedral three years to raise the $15 million to complete the first phase of repairs. In August 2013, the cost of the repairs was re-estimated at $26 million. About $10 million had already been raised by this date to pay for the repairs, half of that coming from the Lilly Endowment. The cathedral began charging a $10 admission fee for tourists in January 2014, and started renting out its worship and other spaces to outside groups to raise cash. The cathedral also transformed the Herb Cottage (its old baptistry building adjacent to the cathedral) into a for-profit coffeehouse operated by the Open City café chain.

Phase I of the restoration, which cost $10 million, repaired the internal ceiling&#x27;s stone and mortar and was completed in February 2015. The planned 10-year, $22 million Phase II will repair or replace the damaged stones atop the cathedral.

In June 2015, Washington National Cathedral leaders said the church needed $200 million, which would both complete repairs and expand its endowment to give the cathedral financial stability. The cathedral began working on a capital fundraising campaign, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; said was one of the largest ever by an American religious institution, to begin in 2018 or 2019. Hall said that the cathedral also planned to reopen the former College of Preachers and its Center for Prayer and Pilgrimage (a space on the cathedral&#x27;s crypt level dedicated to prayer, meditation, and devotional practice). After three years of deficit spending, however, the cathedral also announced additional cuts to music programs to balance its budget.

In September 2022, the Cathedral launched a $150 million comprehensive campaign, &quot;A Cathedral for the Future,&quot; which targets raising all necessary funds to complete the remaining earthquake repairs, estimated at around $24 million. Once full funding is acquired, project managers estimate it will take several years to complete, given the complexity of the work and the great heights and weather conditions. The Cathedral hopes to complete all earthquake repairs by 2030.

=== Lee-Jackson stained glass windows ===

In June 2016, after an examination by a five-person task force, it was announced that two Confederate battle flag images would be removed from stained glass windows commemorating the lives of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. The windows were installed in 1953 after lobbying by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. In its report, the task force wrote that it &quot;is unanimous in its decision that the windows provide a catalyst for honest discussions about race and the legacy of slavery and for addressing the uncomfortable and too often avoided issues of race in America. Moreover, the windows serve as a profound witness to the cathedral&#x27;s own complex history in relationship to race.&quot;

On September 6, 2017, the cathedral, in a statement signed by the Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, the Very Rev. Randolph Marshall Hollerith, dean of the cathedral, and John Donoghue, chair of the cathedral chapter, announced its decision to deconsecrate and remove the stained glass windows honoring Lee and Jackson. The Robert E. Lee window was subsequently loaned to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of African American History and Culture for an exhibit on the legacy of Reconstruction.

On September 23, 2023, the &quot;Now and Forever&quot; Windows were unveiled and dedicated at the Cathedral. The dedication service featured remarks from visual artist and window designer Kerry James Marshall, and a special reading of &#x27;American Song&#x27; by poet Elizabeth Alexander.

==Financial challenges and recent success ==
In January 2003, Nathan D. Baxter, dean of the cathedral, announced his retirement effective from June 30, 2003. Baxter had led the cathedral since 1991. After an 18-month search, Samuel T. Lloyd III was named dean and began his tenure on April 23, 2005. Using a $15 million bequest the cathedral received in 2000, Lloyd rapidly expanded the cathedral&#x27;s programming. Meanwhile, the cathedral deferred maintenance and declined to make needed repairs. Construction also began in summer 2005 on a $34 million, four-level, 430-car underground parking garage. It opened in 2007. The structure was pushed by John Bryson Chane, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, and was mostly funded by debt. Payments on the garage were $500,000 per year, with a major increase in the annual debt service beginning in 2017. In early 2008, the National Cathedral Association, the church&#x27;s fundraising donor network, was disbanded after cathedral leaders concluded that the building was &quot;finished&quot; and it was no longer necessary to raise significant funds for construction.

The 2008–2009 Great Recession hit the cathedral hard. By June 2010, the cathedral cut its budget from $27 million to $13 million, outsourced the operation of its gift shop, shut its greenhouse, cancelled its plans to replace the Skinner organ in the sanctuary, and ceased operation of the College of Preachers that had provided Episcopal clergy nationwide with continuing theological education. The cathedral also laid off 100 of its 170 staff members, including its art conservator and its liturgist (who researched and advocated the use of liturgies at the cathedral). It also significantly cut back on programming, music performances, and classes. To help stabilize its finances, the cathedral began an $11 million fundraising campaign and used $2.5 million of its $50 million endowment to plug budget holes. The National Cathedral Association was recreated as well.

In June 2010, the cathedral announced that it was exploring the sale of its rare book collection, the value of which was estimated to be several million dollars. It sold a number of books to a private collector in 2011 for $857,000 and in 2013 donated most of the remaining collection to Virginia Theological Seminary.

As the economic downturn continued, a report by cathedral staff identified $30 million in needed maintenance and repairs. Among the problems were cracked and missing mortar in the oldest sections of the building; broken HVAC, mechanical, and plumbing systems throughout the structure; extensive preservation needs; and a main organ in disrepair. Repointing the building was estimated to cost at least $5 million, while organ repair was set at $15 million.

The Very Rev. Randolph Marshall Hollerith was named the 11th dean of the Cathedral on May 23, 2016 and began his tenure on Aug. 1, 2016. He was installed in November, 2016. In 2019, he launched the Cathedral&#x27;s five-year Strategic Plan to focus on Welcoming, Deepening, Convening and Serving. In order to carry out the mission priorities of the five-year plan, the Cathedral launched a $150 million &quot;A Cathedral for the Future&quot; comprehensive campaign; at its public launch in 2022, the campaign had already surpassed $115 million. The multifaceted campaign aims to secure total funding to complete earthquake repairs, fully renovate the 1938 Ernest M. Skinner &amp; Son pipe organ, replace the audio system in the Cathedral nave, and sustain all operations over a five-year period. A centerpiece of the campaign is the new Virginia Mae Center (formerly known as the College of Preachers), which underwent a $24 million renovation to reopen as a fully accessible retreat house and conference center, and to serve as a hub of operations for the newly launched Cathedral College of Faith &amp; Culture.

Hollerith also navigated the Cathedral through dramatic changes and a pivot to digital-first operations when the COVID-19 pandemic closed the Cathedral&#x27;s doors for nearly 18 months. From March 2020 through July 2021, all Cathedral services were online, with only minimal clergy and musicians inside the Cathedral. The Cathedral&#x27;s first Easter service during COVID, in 2020, attracted more than 50,000 online viewers, and the Cathedral now counts a virtual congregation that spans six continents, with 3,000-5,000 viewers joining online for Sunday worship services every week. 

Since 2016, under Hollerith&#x27;s leadership and financial stewardship, the Cathedral has stabilized its finances, reporting consecutive annual operating surpluses in its audited financial statements, and moving forward with some large capital projects including the renovation and opening of the Virginia Mae Center, commencement of the great organ renovation, and continued earthquake repairs. 

==Architecture==

The cathedral&#x27;s final design shows a mix of influences from the various Gothic architectural styles of the Middle Ages, identifiable in its pointed arches, flying buttresses, a variety of ceiling vaulting, stained-glass windows and carved decorations in stone, and by its three similar towers, two on the west front and one surmounting the crossing.

The structure consists of a long, narrow rectangular mass formed by a nine-bay nave with wide side aisles and a five-bay chancel, intersected by a six-bay transept. Above the crossing, rising above the ground, is the Gloria in Excelsis Tower; its top, at above sea level, is the highest point in Washington. The Pilgrim Observation Gallery—which occupies a space about 3/4ths of the way up in the west-end towers—provides sweeping views of the city. Unique in North America, the central tower has two full sets of bells—a 53-bell carillon and a 10-bell peal for change ringing; the change bells are rung by members of the Washington Ringing Society. The cathedral sits on a landscaped plot on Mount Saint Alban. The one-story porch projecting from the south transept has a large portal with a carved tympanum. This portal is approached by the Pilgrim Steps, a long flight of steps wide.

Most of the building is constructed using a buff-colored Indiana limestone over a traditional masonry core. Structural, load-bearing steel is limited to the roof&#x27;s trusses (traditionally built of timber); concrete is used significantly in the support structures for bells of the central tower, and the floors in the west towers.

Glastonbury Abbey provided stone for the bishop&#x27;s formal seat, the cathedra. The high altar, the Jerusalem Altar, is made from stones quarried at Solomon&#x27;s Quarry near Jerusalem, reputedly where the stones for Solomon&#x27;s Temple were quarried. In the floor directly in front of that altar are set ten stones from the Chapel of Moses on Mount Sinai, representing the Ten Commandments as a foundation for the Jerusalem Altar.

In contrast to the stone floors that dominate most of the cathedral, the main altar’s eastward orientation features a wooden floor adorned with the  Jerusalem Cross. Notably, this space serves as the stage for orchestra and choir concerts on  United States Independence Day  and a place for state funerals, where the coffins rest on the Jerusalem Cross. 

There are many other works of art including over two hundred stained glass windows, the most familiar of which may be the Space Window, honoring mankind&#x27;s landing on the Moon, which includes a fragment of lunar rock at its center; the rock was presented at the dedication service on July 21, 1974, the fifth anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. Extensive wrought iron adorns the building, much of it the work of Samuel Yellin. A substantial gate of forged iron and carbon steel by Albert Paley was installed on the north side of the crypt level in 2008. Intricate woodcarving, wall-sized murals and mosaics, and monumental cast bronze gates can also be found. Most of the interior decorative elements have Christian symbolism, in reference to the church&#x27;s Episcopal roots, but the cathedral is filled with memorials to persons or events of national significance: statues of Washington and Lincoln, state seals embedded in the marble floor of the narthex, state flags that hang along the nave, stained glass commemorating events like the Lewis and Clark expedition and the raising of the American flag at Iwo Jima.

The cathedral was built with several intentional &quot;flaws&quot; in keeping with an apocryphal medieval custom that sought to illustrate that only God can be perfect. Artistically speaking, these flaws (which often come in the form of intentional asymmetries) draw the observer&#x27;s focus to the sacred geometry as well as compensate for visual distortions, a practice that has been used since the Pyramids and the Parthenon. The architects designed the crypt chapels in Norman, Romanesque, and Transitional styles predating the Gothic, as though the cathedral had been built as a successor to earlier churches, a common occurrence in European cathedrals.

Numerous grotesques and gargoyles adorn the exterior, most of them designed by the carvers; one of the more famous of these is a caricature of then-master carver Roger Morigi on the north exterior of the nave. There were also two competitions held for the public to provide designs to supplement those of the carvers. The second of these produced the famous Darth Vader grotesque which is high on the northwest tower, sculpted by Jay Hall Carpenter and carved by Patrick J. Plunkett.

The west facade follows an iconographic program of Creation rather than that of the Last Judgement as was traditional in medieval churches. All of the sculptural work was designed by Frederick Hart and features tympanum carvings of the creation of the Sun and Moon over the outer doors and the creation of man over the center. Hart also sculpted the three statues of Adam and Saints Peter and Paul. The west doors are cast bronze rather than wrought iron. The west rose window, often used as a trademark of the cathedral, was designed by Rowan LeCompte and is an abstract depiction of the creation of light. LeCompte, who also designed the clerestory windows and the mosaics in the Resurrection Chapel, chose a nonrepresentational design because he feared that a figural window could fail to be seen adequately from the great distance to the nave.

===Canterbury Pulpit===

The Cathedral&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Pulpit&quot; was carved from stones from Canterbury Cathedral, the spiritual center of Anglicanism. It rises ten feet height and thirteen steps high. Made of Caen limestone believed to have originated with William the Conqueror, the pulpit was sculpted under the direction of W. D. Caröe. The central panel depicts King John&#x27;s signing of Magna Carta in 1215 as Stephen Langton, archbishop of Canterbury, looks on. The side panels depict figures in the history of the English Church: Venerable Bede and William Tyndale. Jon Meacham wrote in 2013 of the pulpit, &quot;it is from here, from this rock, that preachers are given the peculiar opportunity to address not only those in the pews but those in power.&quot; It was from this pulpit that Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his final Sunday sermon on March 31, 1968, four days before his assassination.

===Architects===

The cathedral&#x27;s master plan was designed by George Frederick Bodley (founder of Watts &amp; Co.), a highly regarded British Gothic Revival architect of the late-19th and early-20th centuries, and was influenced by Canterbury. Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. contributed a landscaping plan for the cathedral close and Nellie B. Allen designed a knot garden for the Bishop&#x27;s Garden. After Bodley died in 1907, his partner Henry Vaughan revised the original design, but work stopped during World War I and Vaughan died in 1917.

When work resumed after the war, the chapter hired Boston architecture firm Frohman, Robb and Little to execute the building. Philip Hubert Frohman, who had designed his first fully functional home at age 14 and received his architectural degree at age 16, and his partners worked to perfect Bodley&#x27;s vision, adding the carillon section of the central tower, enlarging the west façade, and making numerous smaller changes. Ralph Adams Cram was hired to supervise Frohman, because of his experience with the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, but Cram insisted on so many major changes to the original design that Frohman convinced the cathedral chapter to fire him. By Frohman&#x27;s death in 1972, the final plans had been completed and the building was finished accordingly.

==Leadership and funding==

The cathedral is both the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Washington (currently Mariann Edgar Budde) and the primatial seat of the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church (currently Sean Rowe). Budde was elected by the Diocese of Washington in June 2011, to replace Bishop John Bryson Chane; upon her confirmation in November 2011 she became the ninth bishop of the diocese and the first woman to fill the role.

The National Cathedral Association (NCA) began in 1899 to help raise funds to build the Cathedral. Across the United States, it has more than 14,000 members, more than 88 percent of whom live outside the Washington area, and who are divided into committees by state. Supporters who give at least $60 per year are automatically enrolled in the NCA, which includes free admission to the Cathedral and other benefits.

The budget, $27 million in 2008, was trimmed to $13 million in 2010. Staff was reduced from 170 to 70. There was an endowment of $50 million. The current 2024-2025 budget has grown back to approximately $25 million (approximately $17 million in inflation-adjusted 2008 dollars). 

===Cathedral leadership===
Gary R. Hall was chosen to be the 10th dean of Washington National Cathedral in July 2012. Hall retired as dean on Dec. 31, 2015. 

In May 2016, Randolph Marshall Hollerith was named as the next dean of the cathedral. Hollerith came to the National Cathedral from St. James Episcopal Church in Richmond, Virginia, where he was rector from 2000 to 2016.

The worship department is, like the cathedral itself, rooted in the doctrine and practice of the Episcopal Church, and based in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. Weekday services of Morning Prayer are offered by Cathedral clergy online. From September through May, the cathedral choirs sing Evensong Sunday through Thursday. Two services of the Eucharist are held on Sundays, along with Choral Evensong. The Cathedral&#x27;s current Canon for Worship is the Rev. Canon Rosemarie Logan Duncan.

The cathedral also has been a temporary home to several congregations, including a Jewish synagogue and an Eastern Orthodox community. It has also been the site for several ecumenical and interfaith services. In October 2005, at the cathedral, the Rev. Nancy Wilson was consecrated and installed as moderator (denominational executive) of the Metropolitan Community Church, by its founding moderator, the Rev. Troy Perry.

Each Christmas, the cathedral holds special services, which are broadcast to the world. The Christmas service at the cathedral was broadcast to the nation on television from 1953 until 2010 and is still webcast live from the cathedral&#x27;s homepage and its YouTube channel.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Cathedral stopped offering their 9am Contemporary Eucharist, thus only offering the 8am Holy Eucharist (said) and the 11:15 Principal Holy Eucharist. The 11:15 service typically features a blended worship style with music offered by the Cathedral Choir and Cathedral Contemporary Ensemble.

In September 2024, Michael McCarthy stepped down as Canon for Music and Director of Institutional Planning after nearly 21 years. 

=== Choirs ===
The Washington National Cathedral Choir of Men and Boys, founded in 1909, is one of very few cathedral choirs of men and boys in the United States with an affiliated school, in the English choir tradition. The eighteen to twenty-two boys singing treble are of ages 8 to 14 and attend St. Albans School, the Cathedral school for boys, on vocal scholarships.

In 1997, the Cathedral Choir of Men and Girls was formed by Bruce Neswick, using the same men as the choir of the men and boys. The Choir consists of middle and high school girls attending the National Cathedral School on vocal scholarships. The two choirs currently share service duties and occasionally collaborate.
Both choirs have recorded several CDs, including a Christmas album; a U.S. premiere recording of Ståle Kleiberg&#x27;s &quot;Requiem for the Victims of Nazi Persecution&quot; in 2004; and a patriotic album, &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; in 2005.

The choirs rehearse separately every weekday morning in a graded class incorporated into their school schedule. The choristers sing Evensong five days a week (the Boys Choir on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the Girls Choir on Mondays and Wednesdays). The choirs alternate Sunday worship duties, singing both morning Eucharist and afternoon Evensong when they are on call. The choirs also sing for numerous state and national events. The choirs are featured annually on &quot;Christmas at Washington National Cathedral&quot;, broadcast nationally on Christmas Day.

As of Fall 2024, the chorister schedule has adapted as a result of post-COVID program challenges. The Choristers sing one Sunday morning monthly (boys and girls together), alternate Sunday Evensong services weekly, and the Girls Cathedral Choir sings Evensong on Wednesdays, and the Boys Cathedral Choir sings Evensong on Thursdays. All other services are sung by the (Professional) Cathedral Choir. 

The resident symphonic chorus of Washington National Cathedral is the Cathedral Choral Society.

=== The Great Organ ===
The Great Organ was installed by the Ernest M. Skinner &amp; Son Organ Company in 1938. The original instrument consisted of approximately 8,400 pipes. The instrument was enlarged by the Aeolian-Skinner Organ Company in 1963 and again between 1970 and 1975, during which time more than half of the original instrument was removed. The present instrument consists of 189 ranks and 10,647 pipes.

==== Renovation ====
Although the instrument was mechanically restored in the late 80s and early 90s, the instrument has deteriorated to the point where a third of the instrument was unplayable, including the entire Solo division. Furthermore, the layout of the organ created a confusing sonic effect for listeners, and the neo-classical approach to organ building that was popular during the era of the Organ Reform Movement had become obsolete. The organ was to be replaced with a new instrument built by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders, but this plan was scrapped in 2009. 

As of 2023, plans are being developed for a renovation of the instrument. The organ will be renovated by Foley-Baker Inc. of Tolland, CT over a span of 4 years from 2024 to 2028 at the cost of $14 million, and is expected to reduce the size of the organ to 172 ranks and 9,787 pipes.It will include a complete removal of the instrument, and the addition of a suitable digital organ by the Walker Technical Company for the duration of the project. This renovation will include the addition of a new division within the Nave to improve the clarity of the organ to listeners within the Nave, a new mechanical chassis for the instrument, and the removal of some of the least successful pipes from the 1970s renovation. Approximately 50 ranks of pipes from the original 1938 instrument remain, and as many of these ranks will be reused as possible, as well as some of the pipes from the 1970s renovation. The rest of the instrument will consist of new pipework which will seamlessly integrate with what remains from the previous instrument.

On December 31, 2023 the temporary Walker organ was unveiled during worship services. The original pipe organ was removed over the course of several weeks and shipped to Foley-Baker for repairs. 

=== Bells ===
The cathedral is unique in North America in having both a carillon and a set of change ringing bells.

The ring of 10 bells (tenor in D) are hung in the English style for full circle ringing. All ten were cast in 1962 by Mears &amp; Stainbank (now known as The Whitechapel Bell Foundry) of London, England.

The carillon has 53 bells ranging from to and was manufactured by John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough, England in 1963. The bells are hung &quot;dead&quot;, meaning rigidly fixed, and are struck on the inside by hammers activated from the keyboard.

=== Contemporary music ===
In 2016, under the leadership of then-Associate for Worship and Music, the Rev. Dr. Andrew K. Barnett, the Cathedral transformed its 9:00am Sunday Eucharist into a BAS Communion Service with both contemporary language and music. This meant regular collaborations with Barnett&#x27;s Theodicy Jazz Collective. Following Barnett&#x27;s departure in 2019 (to All Saints, Atlanta), GRAMMY-Award nominee Daryl L.A. Hunt joined the Cathedral as Associate Director of Music for Contemporary Worship where he expanded the Cathedral Band and focused the Cathedral&#x27;s contemporary music offerings towards African American spirituals and contemporary ensemble music. Since March 2020, the Cathedral&#x27;s Principal Sunday Eucharist at 11:15am has included a blend of contemporary and traditional music with contributions from Michele Fowlin, Associate Director of Music for Contemporary Worship.

==In popular culture==
The cathedral played a major role in &quot;The West Wing&quot; season 2 finale &quot;Two Cathedrals.&quot; In a scene following the funeral of a major character, President Bartlet engages in a one-sided argument with God which seamlessly blends English and Latin dialogue. The cathedral also makes appearances in the following movies: &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; (1993), &quot;Lady-like&quot; (2017), and the short documentary &quot;The Stone Carvers&quot; (1984), which describes the construction of the cathedral.

<text>This list of birds of Great Britain comprises all bird species that have been recorded in a wild state in Great Britain. It follows the official British List, maintained by the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union (BOU). Decisions relating to the British List are published by the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union Records Committee (BOURC) in its annual reports in the BOU&#x27;s journal &quot;Ibis&quot;. These reports were formerly geographically based and included the whole of the British Isles, but records for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are now published by their own ornithological associations. Records from the Isle of Man are adjudicated by the Manx Ornithological Society.

Bird species admitted to the British List are those in BOU categories A, B or C:
*A: species that have been recorded in an apparently natural state at least once since 1 January 1950.
*B: species that were recorded in an apparently natural state at least once between 1 January 1800 and 31 December 1949, but have not been recorded subsequently.
*C: species that, although originally introduced by humans, either deliberately or accidentally, have established breeding populations derived from introduced stock, which maintain themselves without necessary recourse to further introduction.
Birds can be listed in more than one category: for example, the Canada goose has a large introduced population but there have also been a few naturally occurring vagrants, and the white-tailed eagle is a native species that is also subject to an ongoing reintroduction project, so both species meet the criteria for categories A and C.

Categories D and E (not listed here) are used for record keeping only, and species in these categories are not included in the British List:
*D: species that would otherwise appear in categories A or B except that there is reasonable doubt that they have ever occurred in a natural state.
*E: species that have been recorded as introductions, transportees, or escapees from captivity, and whose breeding populations (if any) are not believed to be self-sustaining.
A further category (not listed here) is being compiled:
* F: species recorded before 1800, including fossil species.

As of 13 August 2024, there are 641 species of birds on the British List, the latest addition being western olivaceous warbler on 20-21 October 2023. Five species groups (birds that were not identified to species level) are included in an appendix to the December 2023 amendment – southern/northern giant petrel (&quot;Macronectes giganteus&quot;/&quot;halli&quot;), Fea&#x27;s/Desertas petrel (&quot;Pterodroma feae&quot;/&quot;desertas&quot;), black-bellied/white-bellied storm petrel (&quot;Fregetta tropica/grallaria&quot;), brown/south polar skua (&quot;Stercorarius antarctica/maccormickii&quot;), and Asian/Mediterranean/Turkestan short-toed lark (&quot;Alaudala cheleensis&quot;/&quot;rufescens&quot;/&quot;heinei&quot;). A number of additional species are awaiting consideration by the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union Records Committee.

Species listed on this page as &quot;rare&quot; are those for which a full description is required for acceptance of the record by the British Birds Rarities Committee. Other species have an indication of their breeding and wintering status in Great Britain.

In general the avifauna of Britain is similar to that of the rest of Europe. Because of its mild winters, Great Britain has a considerable population of wintering species, particularly ducks, geese and swans. There are also a number of species, such as the oystercatcher, that are resident on the island of Great Britain, but migrants elsewhere. Britain receives a number of vagrants from Asia and North America. Some American gulls, ducks and waders are regular enough not to be considered rare, including the ring-billed gull, surf scoter and pectoral sandpiper. There is one endemic bird species found in Great Britain: the Scottish crossbill.

<text>The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is an agency of the United States federal government responsible for developing and promoting United States foreign trade policies. Part of the Executive Office of the President, it is headed by the United States Trade Representative, a Cabinet-level position that serves as the United States president&#x27;s primary advisor, negotiator, and spokesperson on trade matters. USTR has more than two hundred employees, with offices in Geneva, Switzerland, and Brussels, Belgium.

USTR was established as the Office of the Special Trade Representative (STR) by the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, leads trade negotiations at bilateral and multilateral levels, and coordinates trade policy with other government agencies through the Trade Policy Committee (TPC), Trade Policy Committee Review Group (TPCRG), and Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC). Its areas of expertise include foreign direct investment, commodity agreements, trade-related intellectual property protection, and trade disputes before the World Trade Organization. Based in Washington, D.C., Juan Millan is the current acting United States trade representative.

==Organization==
===Leadership===
The head of the office holds the title of United States Trade Representative (USTR), which is a Cabinet-level position, though not technically within the Cabinet, as is the case with office heads not of US departments but rather of offices contained within the Executive Office of the President. To fill the post, the president nominates someone for the position, and the appointment is then approved or rejected by a simple majority of the Senate. The United States trade representative and deputy United States trade representatives (DUSTR) carry the title of ambassador.

In the Obama administration, Michael Froman served as the US trade representative from 2013 to 2017, with Michael Punke and Robert Holleyman serving as deputy US trade representatives. Ambassador Punke also concurrently served as the U.S. ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Robert Lighthizer served during the Trump&#x27;s first presidency. Katherine Tai served during the presidency of Joe Biden.

===Office of WTO and Multilateral Affairs===
The USTR participates in the World Trade Organization, which is currently in the Doha Development Round. This is partially managed by the USTR Office of WTO and Multilateral Affairs (WAMA). Relevant WTO agreements include the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the Generalized System of Preferences.

==History of the United States trade representative==
Trade negotiations became more complicated in the twentieth century with the rise of multilateral organizations and technological advances allowing for more commerce. As a result, the organization of the U.S. government (with Congress in charge of regulating foreign commerce and the executive branch in charge of treaties) became less efficient and in 1962 Congress passed a bill calling for the president to appoint a Special Representative for Trade Negotiations who would make suggestions to the president on the matters of trade. In the 1970s, Congress expanded this position, making it more accountable to Congress (the position has been called &quot;a creature of congress&quot;), and made it cabinet-level. Finally, in 1980 the position was renamed the United States Trade Representative.

The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 elevated the position&#x27;s role to &quot;coordinate trade policy, serve as the President&#x27;s principal trade advisor and trade &#x27;spokesperson&#x27;, and lead U.S. international trade negotiations&quot;. It also &quot;required the USTR to report to both the President and Congress&quot;.

==Issue areas==

==Reports==
===&quot;National Trade Estimate&quot;===
The &quot;National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers&quot; (&quot;National Trade Estimate&quot; or &quot;NTE&quot;) is an annual series prepared by the USTR, which reports significant foreign barriers to U.S. exports. Since 1986, the &quot;NTE&quot; has provided, where feasible, quantitative estimates of the impact of these foreign practices on the value of U.S. exports. Information is also included on actions taken to eliminate barriers. It is based on information provided by USTR, the U.S. departments of commerce and agriculture, and other agencies and sources.

===The Special 301 Report===


The Special 301 Report is prepared annually by the USTR under Section 182 as amended of the Trade Act of 1974. The act states that the USTR must on an annual basis, by April of each year:
identify those foreign countries that deny adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights, or deny fair and equitable markets access to United States persons that rely upon intellectual property protection, and those foreign countries identified under&quot; this &quot;paragraph that are determined by the Trade Representative to be priority foreign countries&quot;. The Act defines &quot;priority foreign countries&quot; as &quot;those foreign countries that have the most onerous or egregious acts, policies, or practices that deny adequate and effective intellectual property rights, or deny fair and equitable market access to United States persons that rely upon intellectual property protection, whose acts, policies, or practices described in&quot; this &quot;paragraph have the greatest adverse impact (actual or potential) on the relevant United States products, and that are not entering into good faith negotiations, or making significant progress in bilateral or multilateral negotiations to provide adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights.
The Uruguay Round Agreement Act furthermore states that countries may be identified under Special 301 &quot;taking into account the history of intellectual property laws and practices of the foreign country, including any previous identifications&quot; and &quot;the history of efforts of the United States, and the response of the foreign country, to achieve adequate and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights&quot;. It also states that compliance with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights does not include a country from being identified as denying &quot;adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights&quot;.

===Notorious markets===

In 2006, along with the International Intellectual Property Alliance, the USTR published a list of places where large-scale copyright infringement takes place in the Special 301 Report. Since 2010, the notorious markets report has been published as a separate report.

<doc id="211356" wikidata="Q204113" url="?curid=211356" title="Trapezius">
<text>The trapezius is a large paired trapezoid-shaped surface muscle that extends longitudinally from the occipital bone to the lower thoracic vertebrae of the spine and laterally to the spine of the scapula. It moves the scapula and supports the arm.

The trapezius has three functional parts: 

* an upper (descending) part which supports the weight of the arm; 
* a middle region (transverse), which retracts the scapula; and 
* a lower (ascending) part which medially rotates and depresses the scapula.

== Name and history ==
The trapezius muscle resembles a trapezium, also known as a trapezoid, or diamond-shaped quadrilateral. The word &quot;spinotrapezius&quot; refers to the human trapezius, although it is not commonly used in modern texts. In other mammals, it refers to a portion of the analogous muscle.

==Structure==
The &quot;superior&quot; or &quot;upper&quot; (or descending) fibers of the trapezius originate from the spinous process of C7, the external occipital protuberance, the medial third of the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone (both in the back of the head), and the ligamentum nuchae. From this origin, they proceed downward and laterally to be inserted into the posterior border of the lateral third of the clavicle.

The middle fibers, or transverse of the trapezius arise from the spinous process of the seventh cervical (both in the back of the neck), and the spinous processes of the first, second, and third thoracic vertebrae. They are inserted into the medial margin of the acromion, and into the superior lip of the posterior border of the spine of the scapula.

The &quot;inferior&quot; or &quot;lower&quot; (or ascending) fibers of the trapezius arise from the spinous processes of the remaining thoracic vertebrae (T4–T12). From this origin, they proceed upward and laterally to converge near the scapula and end in an aponeurosis, which glides over the smooth triangular surface on the medial end of the spine, to be inserted into a tubercle at the apex of this smooth triangular surface.

At its occipital origin, the trapezius is connected to the bone by a thin fibrous lamina, firmly adherent to the skin. The superficial and deep epimysia are continuous with an investing deep fascia that encircles the neck and also contains both sternocleidomastoid muscles.

At the middle, the muscle is connected to the spinous processes by a broad semi-elliptical aponeurosis, which reaches from the sixth cervical to the third thoracic vertebræ and forms, with that of the opposite muscle, a tendinous ellipse. The rest of the muscle arises by numerous short tendinous fibers.

It is possible to feel the muscles of the superior trapezius as they become active by holding a weight in one hand in front of the body and, with the other hand, touching the area between the shoulder and the neck.

===Innervation===
Motor function is supplied by the accessory nerve. Sensation, including pain and the sense of joint position (proprioception), travel via the ventral rami of the third (C3) and fourth (C4) cervical spinal nerves. Since it is a muscle of the upper limb, the trapezius is not innervated by dorsal rami, despite being placed superficially in the back.

==Function==
Contraction of the trapezius muscle can have two effects: movement of the scapulae when the spinal origins are stable, and movement of the spine when the scapulae are stable. Its main function is to stabilize and move the scapula.

===Scapular movements===
The upper fibers elevate the scapulae, the middle fibers retract the scapulae, and the lower fibers depress the scapulae.

In addition to scapular translation, the trapezius induces scapular rotation. The upper and lower fibers tend to rotate the scapula around the sternoclavicular articulation so that the acromion and inferior angles move up and the medial border moves down (upward rotation). The upper and lower fibers work in tandem with serratus anterior to upwardly rotate the scapulae, and work in opposition to the levator scapulae and the rhomboids, which effect downward rotation.

An example of trapezius function is an overhead press. When activating together, the upper and lower fibers also assist the middle fibers (along with other muscles such as the rhomboids) with scapular retraction/adduction.

The trapezius also assists in abduction of the shoulder above 90 degrees by rotating the glenoid upward. Injury to cranial nerve XI will cause weakness in abducting the shoulder above 90 degrees.

===Spinal movements===

When the scapulae are stable, a co-contraction of both sides can extend the neck.

== Clinical significance ==
Dysfunction of the trapezius can result in winged scapula, sometimes further specified as &quot;lateral winging&quot; and in an abnormal mobility or function of the scapula (scapular dyskinesia). There are multiple causes of trapezius dysfunction.

=== Palsy ===
Trapezius palsy, due to damage of the spinal accessory nerve, is characterized by difficulty with arm adduction and abduction, and associated with a drooping shoulder, and shoulder and neck pain. Intractable trapezius palsy can be surgically managed with an Eden–Lange procedure.

===Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy===
The trapezius muscle is one of the commonly affected muscles in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). The lower and middle fibers are affected initially, and the upper fibers are commonly spared until late in the disease.

===Underdevelopment===
Although rare, underdevelopment or absence of the trapezius has been reported to correlate to neck pain and poor scapular control that are not responsive to physical therapy. Absence of the trapezius has been reported in association with Poland syndrome.

==Society and culture==

===Exercises===
* The upper portion of the trapezius can be developed by elevating the shoulders. Common exercises for this movement are any version of the clean, particularly the hang clean, and the shoulder shrug. The uppermost area can be trained through neck extension.
* Middle fibers are developed by pulling shoulder blades together. This adduction also uses the upper/lower fibers.
* The lower part can be developed by drawing the shoulder blades downward while keeping the arms almost straight and stiff.

It is mainly used in throwing, with the deltoid muscle and rotator cuff.

<text>In human anatomy, the acromion (from Greek: &quot;akros&quot;, &quot;highest&quot;, &quot;ōmos&quot;, &quot;shoulder&quot;, : acromia) or summit of the shoulder is a bony process on the scapula (shoulder blade). Together with the coracoid process, it extends laterally over the shoulder joint. The acromion is a continuation of the scapular spine, and hooks over anteriorly. It articulates with the clavicle (collar bone) to form the acromioclavicular joint.

The acromion forms the summit of the shoulder and is a large, somewhat triangular or oblong process, flattened from behind forward. It projects laterally at first, then curves forward and upward to overhang the glenoid fossa. It starts from the base of acromion which marks its projecting point emerging from the spine of scapula.

===Surfaces===
Its superior surface, directed upward, backward, and lateralward, is , rough, and gives attachment to some fibers of the deltoideus, and in the rest of its extent is subcutaneous. Its inferior surface is smooth and concave.

===Borders===
Its lateral border is thick and irregular, and presents three or four tubercles for the tendinous origins of the deltoid. Its medial border, shorter than the lateral, is concave, gives attachment to a portion of the trapezius, and presents about its center a small oval surface for articulation with the acromial end of the clavicle.

===Variation===
There are three morphologically distinct types of acromia and a correlation between these morphologies and rotator cuff tear:
====&quot;Os acromiale&quot;====
The acromion has four ossification centers called (from tip to base) pre-acromion, meso-acromion, meta-acromion, and basi-acromion. In most cases, the first three fuse at 15–18 years, whereas the base part fuses to the scapular spine at 12 years. However, in between 1% and 15% of cases, this osseous union fails and the acromion remains separate as an accessory bone. This condition is referred to as &quot;os acromiale&quot;, but rarely causes pain. Earlier estimates of its prevalence were as low as 1.4%, and this higher estimate was made by Sammarco in the year 2000, based on radiographic and anatomical studies.

Four types of &quot;os acromiale&quot; can be distinguished:
* A non-union between the meso- and meta-acromia, the most common or typical &quot;os acromiale&quot;
* A non-union between the pre- and meso-acromia
* A non-union between the pre- and meso-acromia; and between the meso- and meta-acromia, atypical
* A non-union between the pre- and meso-acromia; between the pre- and meso-acromia; and between the meta- and basi-acromia

This feature was common in skeletons recovered from the Mary Rose shipwreck: it is thought that in those men, much archery practice from childhood on with the mediaeval war bow (which needs a pull three times as strong as the modern standard Olympic bow) pulled at the acromion so much that it prevented bony fusion of the acromion with the scapula.

Although historically regarded as an incidental finding, the &quot;os acromiale&quot; may occasionally produce symptoms from subacromial impingement or instability at the site of non-union. In people with symptoms of &quot;os acromiale&quot;, dynamic ultrasound sometimes shows hypermobility in the area during shoulder movement, or .


==Changes from Age==
Anterior acromial spur formation is an age-dependent process, with a significantly increased likelihood after the age of 50. However, variation in acromial morphological condition are not acquired from the age-related changes such as spur formation and thus contribute to impingement disease independently.

==In other animals==
The acromion process of bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) is particularly elongated compared to that of humans.

Turtles have an acromion that forms the anterior part of the triradiate pectoral girdle (together with the coracoid and scapula). In this highly specialized endoskeletal structure, the scapula is a dorsal (directed upwards) process attached to the first rib; the coracoid is a posteroventral (directed backward and down) process; and the acromion is a medioventral (directed inwards and down) process (also known as the prescapular process) located at the base of the scapula. This had led to some controversy regarding the evolutionary origin of turtles, because in both pareiasaurs and non-mammalian therapsids the acromion is located at the dorsal tip of the scapula.
In modern turtles, the acromion projects ventrally and articulates with the plastron (the flat lower part of the shell), but it evolved independently in pareiasaurs and turtles long before the plastron. In these primitive ancestors, the acromion projected forward to form a strong and flexible articulation between the shoulder girdle and the clavicle. Notwithstanding these changes, the acromion of turtles retains its original function, to support the shoulder girdle and increase stride length.

<doc id="211367" wikidata="Q400837" url="?curid=211367" title="Ahmed Chalabi">
<text>Ahmed Abdel Hadi Chalabi (; 30 October 1945 – 3 November 2015) was an Iraqi dissident politician, convicted fraudster and founder of the Iraqi National Congress (INC) who served as the President of the Governing Council of Iraq (37th Prime Minister of Iraq) and a Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq under Ibrahim al-Jaafari. He is believed to be an Iranian agent and having close ties with Iran.

Chalabi was interim Minister of Oil in Iraq in April–May 2005 and December 2005 – January 2006 and Deputy Prime Minister from May 2005 to May 2006. Chalabi failed to win a seat in parliament in the December 2005 elections, and when the new Iraqi cabinet was announced in May 2006, he was not given a post. Once dubbed the &quot;George Washington of Iraq&quot; by American supporters, he was initially a CIA-backed operative, who later fell out of favor, with U.S. Special Forces raiding his private residence in Baghdad only one year after the invasion of Iraq. He later came under investigation by several U.S. government agencies after switching his allegiances to become an instrument of pro-Iranian influence in Iraqi politics.

In the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Iraqi National Congress (INC), with the assistance of lobbying powerhouse BKSH &amp; Associates, provided a major portion of the information on which the Office of Special Plans based its condemnation of the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, including reports of weapons of mass destruction and alleged ties to al-Qaeda. Most, if not all, of this information has turned out to be false and Chalabi has been called a fabricator. Along with this, Chalabi also subsequently boasted, in an interview with the British Sunday Telegraph, about the impact that their faulty intelligence had on American policy. These factors led to a falling-out between him and the U.S. government. Furthermore, Chalabi was found guilty of bank fraud in the Petra Bank scandal in Jordan and he was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in absentia.

In 2008, Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance Director Jay Garner stated that he believed Chalabi was an Iranian agent. In January 2012, a French intelligence official stated that he believed Chalabi to be &quot;acting on behalf of Iran&quot;.

== Early life ==
Chalabi was the son of a prominent Shia family, one of the wealthy power elite of Baghdad. He was born in Kadhimiya in 1945. His family, who dated back 300 years to the Sultanate, ran Iraq&#x27;s oldest commercial bank under the British-backed Kingdom of Iraq. His father, Abdel Hadi Chalabi, a wealthy grain merchant and member of the Iraqi parliament, became head of the senate when King Abdullah I of Jordan was assassinated.

His family retired from public life to a farmhouse near Baghdad when the military seized power. Chalabi left Iraq with his family in 1958, following the 14 July Revolution, and spent most of his life in the United States and the United Kingdom. He was educated at Baghdad College and Seaford College in Sussex, England before leaving for America.

=== Western education ===
In exile, following the Ba&#x27;ath party takeover, his family acted as the Iraqi Shia clergy&#x27;s bankers. In the mid-1960s, he studied with cryptographer Whitfield Diffie at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from which he received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics. In 1969, he earned a PhD in mathematics from the University of Chicago under the direction of George Glauberman on the Theory of Knots. After which he took a position in the mathematics department at the American University of Beirut. He published three mathematics papers between 1973 and 1980, in the field of abstract algebra.

In 1971, Chalabi married Leila Osseiran, daughter of Lebanese politician Adel Osseiran. They had four children, Tamara, Mariam, Hashem and Hadi. Whilst still at Beirut the civil war broke out in 1975, so he moved to Jordan and found work as an interpreter.

== Business career ==
Chalabi was a bold and shrewd investor, amassing a fortune of $100 million . During his life he was accused of corruption many times. In 1977, he founded the Petra Bank in Jordan with Crown Prince Hassan, the King&#x27;s brother. In May 1989, the Governor of the Central Bank of Jordan, Mohammed Said Nabulsi, issued a decree ordering all banks in the country to deposit 35% of their reserves with the Central Bank. Petra Bank was the only bank that was unable to meet this requirement. An investigation was launched which led to accusations of embezzlement and false accounting. The bank failed, causing a $350 million bail-out by the Central Bank, after which Chalabi fled the country. It was widely reported that Chalabi escaped Jordan locked in the trunk of a car owned by Prince Hassan of Jordan. Chalabi was convicted and sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; for bank fraud by a Jordanian military tribunal to 22 years in prison. Chalabi maintained that his prosecution was a politically motivated effort to discredit him sponsored by Saddam Hussein. 

=== Exile in the UK ===
Living abroad by 1992 in London, and unable to return home for fear of his life, he set up the Iraqi National Congress (INC) with an agenda of regime change for his homeland. The organization was open to all ethnic and religious groups of Iraq, including Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen, Sunni and Shia Muslims. Already a fluent English speaker, he turned his attention to Washington, D.C.

In 1995, after preparation and lobbying, he persuaded President Bill Clinton to fund an expedition into northern Iraq to use subterfuge to start an insurgency. Chalabi was convinced that the Iraqi military would rise up to overthrow the dictator. The commanders to whom he had spoken, were the same who openly supported Saddam and crushed his opponents in the Kurdish and Shia revolts. The insurgency failed, lacking the promised ground troops, and 100 insurgents were killed by the military. The command structure of INC fell apart with factional infighting. Chalabi was banned from those frequent visits to CIA headquarters at Langley, Virginia. Nonetheless, Chalabi was doggedly determined: in 1998 Congress passed the Iraq Liberation Act passing into American law the objective of &quot;regime change&quot; in Iraq.

It was reported by BBC News in May 2005 that the Jordanian government was considering whether to pardon Chalabi, in part to ease the relations between Jordan and the new Iraqi government of which Chalabi was a member. According to one report, Chalabi proposed a $32 million compensation fund for depositors affected by Petra Bank&#x27;s failure. The website for Petra Bank contains a press release stating that Chalabi would refuse the pardon. Although Chalabi always maintained the case was a plot to frame him by Baghdad, the issue was revisited when the U.S. State Department raised questions about the accounting practices of the Iraqi National Congress (INC). According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Chalabi insisted on a public apology, which the Jordanians refused to give.&quot;

Conservative pundit Arnaud de Borchgrave stated that following his escape from Jordan as a wanted fugitive, Chalabi established the Iraqi National Congress by sending out &quot;scores of all-expenses-paid invitations to Iraqi exiles to a conference in Vienna a month later. The conference created INC - and made Mr Chalabi its president&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://www.washingtontimes.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, the Jordan&#x27;s Central Bank Governor, Mohammed Said Nabulsi, had referred to Chalabi as &quot;one of the most notorious crooks in the history of the Middle East&quot;. Chalabi headed the executive council of the INC, an umbrella Iraqi opposition group created in 1992 for the purpose of fomenting the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. The INC received major funding and assistance from the United States. Chalabi was involved in organizing a resistance movement among Kurds in northern Iraq in the early mid-1990s. When that effort was crushed and hundreds of his supporters were killed, Chalabi fled the country. Chalabi lobbied in Washington for the passage of the Iraq Liberation Act (passed October 1998). This earmarked US$97 million to support Iraqi opposition groups. Chalabi and the INC were widely reported to be active CIA assets in the pre-2003 period, with one report in the British Guardian newspaper estimating that CIA operatives had funnelled an estimated $100m to the INC, which had helped to finance the epic failure of the 1996 coup attempt by Kurdish forces. In 2001 it was revealed that INC was accused of false accounting and irregularities. During the period from March 2000 to September 2003, the U.S. State Department paid nearly $33 million to the INC, according to a General Accounting Office report released in 2004, some of which was used to purchase office artefacts.

==Invasion of Iraq==
Before the Iraq War (2003), Chalabi enjoyed close political and business relationships with some members of the U.S. government, including some prominent neoconservatives within the Pentagon. Chalabi was said to have had political contacts within the Project for the New American Century, most notably with Paul Wolfowitz, a student of nuclear strategist Albert Wohlstetter, and Richard Perle. He also enjoyed considerable support among politicians and political pundits in the United States, most notably Jim Hoagland of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, who held him up as a notable force for democracy in Iraq. He was a special guest of First Lady Laura Bush at the 2004 State of the Union Address. Chalabi was flown back to Iraq after the invasion with a force of 700 US-trained militia and was, according to the &quot;Washington Times&quot;, being paid over $300,000 a month by the US government, with the direct support of Vice President Dick Cheney, Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and Douglas Feith.

The CIA was largely skeptical of Chalabi and the INC, but information allegedly from his group (most famously from a defector codenamed &quot;Curveball&quot;) made its way into intelligence dossiers used by President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair to justify an invasion of Iraq. &quot;Curveball&quot;, Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, fed officials hundreds of pages of bogus &quot;firsthand&quot; descriptions of mobile biological weapons factories on wheels and rails. Secretary of State Colin Powell later used this information in a U.N. presentation trying to garner support for the war, despite warnings from German intelligence that &quot;Curveball&quot; was fabricating claims. Since then, the CIA has admitted that the defector made up the story, and Powell said in 2011 the information should not have been used in his presentation. A later congressionally appointed investigation (Robb-Silberman) concluded that Curveball had no relation whatsoever to the INC, and that press reports linking Curveball to the INC were erroneous.

The INC often worked with the media, most notably with Judith Miller, concerning her WMD stories for &quot;The New York Times&quot; starting on 26 February 1998. After the war, given the lack of discovery of WMDs, most of the WMD claims of the INC were shown to have been either misleading, exaggerated, or completely made up while INC information about the whereabouts of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s loyalists and Chalabi&#x27;s personal enemies were accurate. Another of Chalabi&#x27;s advocates was American Enterprise Institute&#x27;s Iraq specialist Danielle Pletka. Chalabi received advice on media and television presentation techniques from the Irish scriptwriter and commentator Eoghan Harris prior to the invasion of Iraq.

During the initial ten days of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, American intelligence discovered signs that Ahmed Chalabi was communicating with the Iranians and sharing details about US troop movements with their government. While this act of betrayal angered the Americans, it was largely downplayed at the time. The U.S. aimed to prevent the conflict from spreading beyond Iraq&#x27;s borders, so it was seen as beneficial that the Iranians were aware that U.S. troops had no intention of entering Iran. When questioned later about his dealings with the Iranian government during that period, Chalabi provided an ambiguous response: &quot;I did not pass any information to Iran that compromised any national security information of the United States.&quot;

In April as U.S. forces took control during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, Chalabi entered with allied troops the southern town of Shatrah. 300 US-trained FIF (Freedom for Iraq Fighters) expected opposition, but none emerged. Thousands of Iraqis cheered the troops. Chalabi returned under their aegis and was given a position on the Iraq interim governing council by the Coalition Provisional Authority. He served as president of the council in September 2003. He denounced a plan to let the UN choose an interim government for Iraq. &quot;We are grateful to President Bush for liberating Iraq, but it is time for the Iraqi people to run their affairs,&quot; he was quoted as saying in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In August 2003, Chalabi was the only candidate whose unfavorable ratings exceeded his favorable ones with Iraqis in a State Department poll. In a survey of nearly 3,000 Iraqis in February 2004 (by Oxford Research International, sponsored by the BBC in the United Kingdom, ABC in the U.S., ARD of Germany, and the NHK in Japan), only 0.2 percent of respondents said he was the most trustworthy leader in Iraq (see survey link below, question #13). A secret document written in 2002 by the British Overseas and Defence Secretariat reportedly described Chalabi as &quot;a convicted fraudster popular on Capitol Hill.&quot;

In response to the WMD controversy, Chalabi told London&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in February 2004, We are heroes in error. As far as we&#x27;re concerned, we&#x27;ve been entirely successful. That tyrant Saddam is gone and the Americans are in Baghdad. What was said before is not important. The Bush administration is looking for a scapegoat.

==Falling out with the U.S., 2004–05==
As Chalabi&#x27;s position of trust with the Pentagon crumbled, he found a new political position as a champion of Iraq&#x27;s Shia (Chalabi himself was Shia). Beginning 25 January 2004, Chalabi and his close associates promoted the claim that leaders around the world were illegally profiting from the Oil for Food program. These charges were around the same time that UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi indicated that Chalabi would likely not be welcome in a future Iraqi government. Up until this time, Chalabi had been mentioned formally several times in connection with possible future leadership positions. Chalabi contended that documents in his possession detailed the misconduct, but he did not provide any documents or other evidence. The U.S. sharply criticized Chalabi&#x27;s Oil for Food investigation as undermining the credibility of its own.

Additionally, Chalabi and other members of the INC were investigated for fraud involving the exchange of Iraqi currency, grand theft of both national and private assets, and many other criminal charges in Iraq. On 19 May 2004 the U.S. government discontinued their regular payments to Chalabi for information he provided. Iraqi police, supported by U.S. soldiers, raided his offices and residence on 20 May, taking documents and computers, presumably to be used as evidence. A major target of the raid was Aras Habib, Chalabi&#x27;s long-term director of intelligence, who controlled the vast network of agents bankrolled by U.S. funding. The U.S. announced that they had stopped funding the INC, having previously paid the organization $330,000 per month.

In June 2004, it was reported that Chalabi gave U.S. state secrets to Iran in April, including the fact that one of the United States&#x27; most valuable sources of Iranian intelligence was a broken Iranian code used by their spy services. Chalabi allegedly learned of the code through a drunk American involved in the code-breaking operation. Chalabi denied all of the charges, which nothing ever came of.

An arrest warrant for alleged counterfeiting was issued for Chalabi on 8 August 2004, while at the same time a warrant was issued on murder charges against his nephew Salem Chalabi (at the time, head of the Iraqi Special Tribunal), while they both were out of the country. Chalabi returned to Iraq on 10 August planning to make himself available to Iraqi government officials, but he was never arrested. Charges were later dropped against Chalabi, with Judge Zuhair al-Maliki citing lack of evidence.

On 1 September 2004, Chalabi told reporters of an assassination attempt made on him near Latifiya, a town south of Baghdad. Chalabi reported he was returning from a meeting with Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani (whose trust Chalabi enjoyed) in Najaf, where a few days earlier a cease-fire had taken effect, ending three weeks of confrontations between followers of Muqtada al-Sadr and the U.S. military, at the time.

He regained enough credibility to be made deputy prime minister on 28 April 2005. At the same time he was made acting oil minister, before the appointment of Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum in May 2005. On protesting IMF austerity measures, Al-Uloum was instructed to extend his vacation by a month in December 2005 by Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari, and Chalabi was reappointed as acting oil minister. Al-Uloum returned to the post in January 2006.

In November 2005, Chalabi traveled to the U.S. and met with top U.S. government officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. At this time Chalabi also traveled to Iran to meet with Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

==Political activity in Iraq, 2005–15==
The Iraqi National Congress, headed by Chalabi, was a part of the United Iraqi Alliance in the 2005 legislative election. After the election, Chalabi claimed that he had the support of the majority of elected members of United Iraqi Alliance and staked claim to be the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Iraq; however, Ibrahim al-Jaafari later emerged as the consensus candidate for prime minister.

Prior to the December 2005 elections, the Iraqi National Congress had left the United Iraqi Alliance and formed the National Congress Coalition, which ran in the elections but failed to win a single seat in Parliament, gaining less than 0.5% of the vote. Other groups joining the INC in this list included: Democratic Iraqi Grouping, Democratic Joint Action Front, First Democratic National Party, Independent List, Iraqi Constitutional Movement, Iraqi Constitutional Party, Tariq Abd al-Karim Al Shahd al-Budairi, and the Turkoman Decision Party. He was refused a seat in the cabinet. Dogged by allegations, still unproven, of corruption he retorted that he had never &quot;participated in any scheme of intelligence against the United States.&quot;

Chalabi attended the 2006 Bilderberg Conference meeting outside of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. In October 2007, Chalabi was appointed by Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki to head the Iraqi services committee, a consortium of eight service ministries and two Baghdad municipal posts tasked with the &quot;surge&quot; plan&#x27;s next phase, restoring electricity, health, education and local security services to Baghdad neighborhoods. &quot;The key is going to be getting the concerned local citizens—and all the citizens—feeling that this government is reconnected with them... [Chalabi] agrees with that,&quot; said Gen. David Petraeus. Chalabi &quot;is an important part of the process,&quot; said Col. Steven Boylan, Petraeus&#x27; spokesman. &quot;He has a lot of energy.&quot; In April 2008, journalist Melik Kaylan wrote about Chalabi, &quot;Arguably, he has, more than anyone in the country, evolved a detailed sense of what ails Baghdadis and how to fix things.&quot;

After the invasion Chalabi was placed in charge of &quot;de-Ba&#x27;athification&quot;—the removal of senior office holders judged to have been close supporters of the deposed Saddam Hussein. The role fell into disuse, but in early 2010 Chalabi was accused of reviving this dormant post to eliminate his political enemies, especially Sunnis. The banning of some 500 candidates prior to the general election of 7 March 2010 at the initiative of Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress was reported to have badly damaged previously improving relations between the Shia and Sunni.

On 26 January 2012, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported Western intelligence officials expressing concern that Chalabi was working with the leading opposition group in Bahrain, Al Wefaq National Islamic Society. A French intelligence official said, &quot;When we hear that some members of the opposition are in touch with Hezbollah or with shady figures like the Iraqi Ahmed Chalabi, of whom we think he is acting on behalf of Iran, then this worries us&quot;. The connection between Chalabi and Al Wefaq was acknowledged by Jawad Fairooz, secretary general of Wefaq and a former member of Parliament in Bahrain. Fairooz said, &quot;Mr Chalabi has helped us with contacts in Washington like other people have done and we thank them.&quot;

During an interview in 2014, he was shown to be frail and depressed about his country&#x27;s future:
Iraq is a mess. Daesh is organised, with one command, united and well run, and we are so fragmented. We have no discipline, no command structure, no effective plans.

==Death==
The period leading up to Chalabi&#x27;s death was marked by regular pronouncements released by Chalabi in various formats in which he would expose alleged corruption of highest officials in the Paul Bremer-led Provisional Coalition Authority and in the Iraqi Government led by Nouri Al Maliki. Chalabi died on 3 November 2015, four days after his 70th birthday, having apparently suffered a heart attack at his home in Kadhimiya, Baghdad. Iraqi Press speculated at the time of his death that it came about as a result of being poisoned due to his ongoing efforts to expose regime corruption. He died while serving as member of the Iraqi Parliament and chaired its Finance Committee. Ahmed Chalabi was laid to rest at the Kadhimiya Holy Shrine, a high honour bestowed by Iraq&#x27;s influential Shia theocratic establishment.

<doc id="211371" wikidata="Q4875616" url="?curid=211371" title="Be/X-ray binary">
<text>Be/X-ray binaries (BeXRBs) are a class of high-mass X-ray binaries that consist of a Be star and a neutron star. The neutron star is usually in a wide highly elliptical orbit around the Be star. The Be stellar wind forms a disk confined to a plane often different from the orbital plane of the neutron star. When the neutron star passes through the Be disk, it accretes a large mass of hot gas in a short time. As the gas falls onto the neutron star, a bright flare in hard X-rays is seen.

==X Persei==

X Persei is a binary system containing a γ Cassiopeiae variable and a pulsar. It has a relatively long period and low eccentricity for this type of binary, which means the x-ray emission is persistent and not usually strongly variable. Some strong x-ray flares have been observed, presumably related to changes in the accretion disc, but no correlations have been found with the strong optical variations.

==LSI+61°303==

LSI+61°303 is a possible example of a Be/X-ray binary star. It is a periodic, radio-emitting binary system that is also the gamma-ray source, CG135+01. It is also a variable radio source characterized by periodic, non-thermal radio outbursts with a period of 26.496 d. The 26.5 d period is attributed to the eccentric orbital motion of a compact object, possibly a neutron star, around a rapidly rotating B0 Ve star. Photometric observations at optical and infrared wavelengths also show a 26.5 d modulation. Although the mass of the compact object in the LS I +61 303 system is not known accurately, it is likely that it is too large to be a neutron star and so it is likely to be a black hole.

Of the 20 or so members of the Be/X-ray binary class, as of 1996, only X Persei and LSI+61°303 have X-ray outbursts of much higher luminosity and harder spectrum (&quot;kT&quot; ≈ 10–20 keV) vs. (&quot;kT&quot; ≤ 1 keV). LSI+61°303 also shows strong radio outbursts, more similar to those of the &quot;standard&quot; short-period high-mass X-ray binaries such as SS 433, Cyg X-3 and Cir X-1.

==RX J0209.6-7427==
RX J0209.6-7427 is a Be/X-ray binary star located in the Magellanic Bridge. A couple of rare outbursts have been observed from this source hosting a neutron star. The last outburst was detected in 2019 after about 26 years. The accreting neutron star in this Be/X-ray binary system is an ultraluminous X-ray Pulsar (ULXP) making it the second closest ULXP and the first ULXP in our neighbouring Galaxy in the Magellanic Clouds.

<text>The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is an American think tank specializing in U.S. foreign policy and international relations. Founded in 1921, it is an independent and nonpartisan 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. CFR is based in New York City, with an additional office in Washington, D.C. Its membership has included senior politicians, secretaries of state, CIA directors, bankers, lawyers, professors, corporate directors, CEOs, and prominent media figures.

CFR meetings convene government officials, global business leaders, and prominent members of the intelligence and foreign-policy communities to discuss international issues. CFR publishes the bi-monthly journal &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; since 1922. It also runs the David Rockefeller Studies Program, which makes recommendations to presidential administrations and the diplomatic community, testifies before Congress, interacts with the media, and publishes research on foreign policy issues.

Michael Froman is the organization&#x27;s 15th president.

==History==
===Origins, 1918 to 1945===

In September 1917, near the end of World War I, President Woodrow Wilson established a working fellowship of about 150 scholars called &quot;The Inquiry&quot;, tasked with briefing him about options for the postwar world after Germany was defeated. This academic group, directed by Wilson&#x27;s closest adviser and long-time friend &quot;Colonel&quot; Edward M. House, and with Walter Lippmann as Head of Research, met to assemble the strategy for the postwar world. The team produced more than 2,000 documents detailing and analyzing the political, economic, and social facts globally that would be helpful for Wilson in the peace talks. Their reports formed the basis for the Fourteen Points, which outlined Wilson&#x27;s strategy for peace after the war&#x27;s end. These scholars then traveled to the Paris Peace Conference 1919 and participated in the discussions there.
As a result of discussions at the Peace Conference, a small group of British and American diplomats and scholars met on May 30, 1919, at the Hotel Majestic in Paris. They decided to create an Anglo-American organization called &quot;The Institute of International Affairs&quot;, which would have offices in London and New York. Ultimately, the British and American delegates formed separate institutes, with the British developing the Royal Institute of International Affairs (known as Chatham House) in London. Due to the isolationist views prevalent in American society at that time, the scholars had difficulty gaining traction with their plan and turned their focus instead to a set of discreet meetings which had been taking place since June 1918 in New York City, under the name &quot;Council on Foreign Relations&quot;. The meetings were headed by corporate lawyer Elihu Root, who had served as Secretary of State under President Theodore Roosevelt, and attended by 108 &quot;high-ranking officers of banking, manufacturing, trading and finance companies, together with many lawyers&quot;.
The members were proponents of Wilson&#x27;s internationalism, but they were particularly concerned about &quot;the effect that the war and the treaty of peace might have on postwar business&quot;. The scholars from the inquiry saw an opportunity to create an organization that brought diplomats, high-level government officials, and academics together with lawyers, bankers, and industrialists to influence government policy. On July 29, 1921, they filed a certification of incorporation, officially forming the Council on Foreign Relations. Founding members included its first honorary president, Elihu Root, and first elected president, John W. Davis, vice-president Paul D. Cravath, and secretary–treasurer Edwin F. Gay.
In 1922, Gay, who was a former dean of the Harvard Business School and director of the Shipping Board during the war, headed the Council&#x27;s efforts to begin publication of a magazine that would be the &quot;authoritative&quot; source on foreign policy. He gathered US$125,000 () from the wealthy members on the council, as well as by sending letters soliciting funds to &quot;the thousand richest Americans&quot;. Using these funds, the first issue of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; was published in September 1922. Within a few years, it had gained a reputation as the &quot;most authoritative American review dealing with international relations&quot;.

In the late 1930s, the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation began financially supporting the Council. In 1938, they created various Committees on Foreign Relations, which later became governed by the American Committees on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C., throughout the country, funded by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation. Influential men were to be chosen in a number of cities, and would then be brought together for discussions in their own communities as well as participating in an annual conference in New York. These local committees served to influence local leaders and shape public opinion to build support for the Council&#x27;s policies, while also acting as &quot;useful listening posts&quot; through which the Council and U.S. government could &quot;sense the mood of the country&quot;.

During the Second World War, the Council achieved much greater prominence within the government and the State Department, when it established the strictly confidential &quot;War and Peace Studies&quot;, funded entirely by the Rockefeller Foundation. The secrecy surrounding this group was such that the Council members who were not involved in its deliberations were completely unaware of the study group&#x27;s existence. It was divided into four functional topic groups: economic and financial; security and armaments; territorial; and political. The security and armaments group was headed by Allen Welsh Dulles, who later became a pivotal figure in the CIA&#x27;s predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). CFR ultimately produced 682 memoranda for the State Department, which were marked classified and circulated among the appropriate government departments•

=== Cold War era, 1945 to 1979 ===

A critical study found that of 502 government officials surveyed from 1945 to 1972, more than half were members of the Council. During the Eisenhower administration 40% of the top U.S. foreign policy officials were CFR members (Eisenhower himself had been a council member); under Truman, 42% of the top posts were filled by council members. During the Kennedy administration, this number rose to 51%, and peaked at 57% under the Johnson administration.

In an anonymous piece called &quot;The Sources of Soviet Conduct&quot; that appeared in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; in 1947, CFR study group member George Kennan coined the term &quot;containment&quot;. The essay would prove to be highly influential in US foreign policy for seven upcoming presidential administrations. Forty years later, Kennan explained that he had never suspected the Russians of any desire to launch an attack on America; he thought that it was obvious enough and he did not need to explain it in his essay. William Bundy credited CFR&#x27;s study groups with helping to lay the framework of thinking that led to the Marshall Plan and NATO. Due to new interest in the group, membership grew towards 1,000.
Dwight D. Eisenhower chaired a CFR study group while he served as President of Columbia University. One member later said, &quot;whatever General Eisenhower knows about economics, he has learned at the study group meetings.&quot; The CFR study group devised an expanded study group called &quot;Americans for Eisenhower&quot; to increase his chances for the presidency. Eisenhower would later draw many Cabinet members from CFR ranks and become a CFR member himself. His primary CFR appointment was Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. Dulles gave a public address at the Harold Pratt House in New York City in which he announced a new direction for Eisenhower&#x27;s foreign policy: &quot;There is no local defense which alone will contain the mighty land power of the communist world. Local defenses must be reinforced by the further deterrent of massive retaliatory power.&quot; After this speech, the council convened a session on &quot;Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy&quot; and chose Henry Kissinger to head it. Kissinger spent the following academic year working on the project at Council headquarters. The book of the same name that he published from his research in 1957 gave him national recognition, topping the national bestseller lists.

CFR played an important role in the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community. CFR promoted a blueprint of the ECSC and helped Jean Monnet promote the ESCS.

On November 24, 1953, a study group heard a report from political scientist William Henderson regarding the ongoing conflict between France and Vietnamese Communist leader Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s Viet Minh forces, a struggle that would later become known as the First Indochina War. Henderson argued that Ho&#x27;s cause was primarily nationalist in nature and that Marxism had &quot;little to do with the current revolution.&quot; Further, the report said, the United States could work with Ho to guide his movement away from Communism. State Department officials, however, expressed skepticism about direct American intervention in Vietnam and the idea was tabled. Over the next twenty years, the United States would find itself allied with anti-Communist South Vietnam and against Ho and his supporters in the Vietnam War.

The Council served as a &quot;breeding ground&quot; for important American policies such as mutual deterrence, arms control, and nuclear non-proliferation.

In 1962 the group began a program of bringing select Air Force officers to the Harold Pratt House to study alongside its scholars. The Army, Navy and Marine Corps requested they start similar programs for their own officers.

A four-year-long study of relations between America and China was conducted by the Council between 1964 and 1968. One study published in 1966 concluded that American citizens were more open to talks with China than their elected leaders. Henry Kissinger had continued to publish in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; and was appointed by President Richard Nixon to serve as National Security Adviser in 1969. In 1971, he embarked on a secret trip to Beijing to broach talks with Chinese leaders. Nixon went to China in 1972, and diplomatic relations were completely normalized by President Carter&#x27;s Secretary of State, another Council member, Cyrus Vance.

The Vietnam War created a rift within the organization. When Hamilton Fish Armstrong announced in 1970 that he would be leaving the helm of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; after 45 years, new chairman David Rockefeller approached a family friend, William Bundy, to take over the position. Anti-war advocates within the Council rose in protest against this appointment, claiming that Bundy&#x27;s hawkish record in the State and Defense Departments and the CIA precluded him from taking over an independent journal. Some considered Bundy a war criminal for his prior actions.

In November 1979, while chairman of CFR, David Rockefeller became embroiled in an international incident when he and Henry Kissinger, along with John J. McCloy and Rockefeller aides, persuaded President Jimmy Carter through the State Department to admit the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, into the US for hospital treatment for lymphoma. This action directly precipitated what is known as the Iran hostage crisis and placed Rockefeller under intense media scrutiny (particularly from &quot;The New York Times&quot;) for the first time in his public life.

In his book, &quot;White House Diary&quot;, Carter wrote of the affair, &quot;April 9 [1979] David Rockefeller came in, apparently to induce me to let the shah come to the United States. Rockefeller, Kissinger, and Brzezinski seem to be adopting this as a joint project&quot;.

==Membership==

The CFR has two types of membership: life membership; and term membership, which lasts for 5 years and is available only to those between the ages of 30 and 36. Only U.S. citizens (native born or naturalized) and permanent residents who have applied for U.S. citizenship are eligible. A candidate for life membership must be nominated in writing by one Council member and seconded by a minimum of three others. Visiting fellows are prohibited from applying for membership until they have completed their fellowship tenure.

Corporate membership is divided into &quot;Associates&quot;, &quot;Affiliates&quot;, &quot;President&#x27;s Circle&quot;, and &quot;Founders&quot;. All corporate executive members have opportunities to hear speakers, including foreign heads of state, chairmen and CEOs of multinational corporations, and U.S. officials and Congressmen. President and premium members are also entitled to attend small, private dinners or receptions with senior American officials and world leaders.

The CFR has a Young Professionals Briefing Series designed for young leaders interested in international relations to be eligible for term membership.

Women were excluded from membership until the 1960s.

==As a charity==
The Council on Foreign Relations received a three-star rating (out of four stars) from Charity Navigator in fiscal year 2016, as measured by an analysis of the council&#x27;s financial data and &quot;accountability and transparency&quot;. In fiscal year 2023, the council received a four-star rating (98 percent) from Charity Navigator.

==Reception==
In an article for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Richard Harwood described the membership of the CFR as &quot;the nearest thing we have to a ruling establishment in the United States&quot;.

In 2019, CFR was criticized for accepting a donation from Len Blavatnik, a Ukrainian-born billionaire with close links to Vladimir Putin. The council was reported to be under fire from its own members and dozens of international affairs experts over its acceptance of a $12 million gift to fund an internship program. Fifty-five international relations scholars and Russia experts wrote a letter to the organization&#x27;s board and CFR president Richard N. Haass: &quot;It is our considered view that Blavatnik uses his &#x27;philanthropy&#x27;—funds obtained by and with the consent of the Kremlin, at the expense of the state budget and the Russian people—at leading western academic and cultural institutions to advance his access to political circles. We regard this as another step in the longstanding effort of Mr. Blavatnik—who ... has close ties to the Kremlin and its kleptocratic network—to launder his image in the West.&quot;

==Publications==

<text>The Committee for the Liberation of Iraq (CLI) was a non-governmental organization which described itself as a &quot;distinguished group of Americans&quot; who wanted to &quot;free Iraq from Saddam Hussein&quot;.

==History==
The organization was founded in 2002. In a news release announcing its formation, the group said its goal was to &quot;promote regional peace, political freedom and international security through replacement of the Saddam Hussein regime with a democratic government that respects the rights of the Iraqi people and ceases to threaten the community of nations.&quot; It had close links to the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) and the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), important shapers of the Bush administration&#x27;s foreign policy.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in November 2002 that &quot;the organization is modeled on a successful lobbying campaign to expand the NATO alliance. Members include former secretary of state George P. Shultz, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and former senator Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.). ... While the Iraq committee is an independent entity, committee officers said they expect to work closely with the administration. They already have met with Hadley and Bush political adviser Karl Rove. Committee officers and a White House spokesman said Rice, Hadley and Cheney will soon meet with the group.&quot;

With the successful removal of Saddam Hussein, the committee appears to have disbanded, and its once-prominent website no longer exists. However, its offices still remain on Pennsylvania Avenue and 10th Street.

== Personnel ==

<doc id="211376" wikidata="Q7292419" url="?curid=211376" title="Randy Scheunemann">
<text>Randall James &quot;Randy&quot; Scheunemann (born January 12, 1960) is an American neoconservative lobbyist. He is the President of the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, which was created by the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), of which he is a board member. He was Trent Lott&#x27;s National Security Aide and was an advisor to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on Iraq. He is a paid lobbyist for the country of Georgia and was 2008 presidential candidate John McCain&#x27;s foreign policy aide.

== Family ==
Scheunemann moved with his parents to the neighborhood of River Hills, in Burnsville, Minnesota in 1965.

*Father: Paul Scheunemann, born 1926, died 2003. Mayor of Burnsville 1978-1982. Stricken with polio at age 15; used a wheelchair thereafter.
*Mother: Gladys (Olson), born 1932, died 2000

== Education and early career ==
Scheunemann attended public school in Burnsville, Minnesota: Sioux Trail elementary school (1966–1972), John Metcalf Junior High School (1972–1975) and finally Burnsville High School (1975–1978) from which he graduated in 1978.

Scheunemann has a degree from the University of Minnesota, and did graduate work at Tufts University. He moved to Capitol Hill in 1986, working in the office of Republican Senator Dave Durenberger. In 1993, he moved onto the staff of Republican Senator Bob Dole, as a foreign policy advisor. He left Dole&#x27;s staff to work for Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.

==Lobbyist==
In 1998, Scheunemann went to work for the public relations firm Mercury Group.

During the 2002 and early 2003 campaign by the George W. Bush administration to generate public support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Scheunemann had a close association with Iraq exile Ahmad Chalabi.

Until May 2008, Scheunemann was co-owner of a two-person Washington, D.C. lobbying firm, Orion Strategies, LLC. The firm has lobbied on behalf of the Open Society Policy Center, the Caspian Alliance, Lockheed Martin, BP, and the National Rifle Association of America, among foreign governments such as Latvia, Taiwan, Croatia, and Macedonia.

He is a member of the board of directors of the International Republican Institute.

== 2008 McCain presidential advisor ==

While the foreign affairs advisor to Republican presidential candidate John McCain, Scheunemann was also a registered foreign agent (lobbyist) for the Republic of Georgia.

On April 17, 2008, McCain spoke on the phone with Georgia President Mikheil Saakashvili about the situation in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two troubled provinces that are considered part of Georgia but have been de facto independent since 1990. That same day, McCain issued a public statement condemning Russia and expressing strong support for the Georgian position. Also on that same day, Georgia signed a new, $200,000 lobbying contract with Scheunemann&#x27;s firm, Orion Strategies. Scheunemann remained with Orion Strategies until May 15, when the McCain campaign imposed an anti-lobbyist policy and he was required to separate himself from the company.

In mid-July 2008, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; linked Scheunemann to Stephen Payne, a lobbyist covertly filmed as he discussed a lobbying contract and offered to arrange meetings with Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and others, and recommended donations to the George W. Bush Presidential Library. Payne said Scheunemann had been &quot;working with me on my payroll for five of the last eight years.&quot;
 In late October 2008, &quot;Politico&quot; regarded Scheunemann as a potential pick as the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs if John McCain defeats Democratic candidate Barack Obama.

A day after the election, a CNN article claimed that Scheunemann had been fired by the McCain campaign a week earlier for &quot;trashing&quot; campaign staff and &quot;positioning himself with Palin at the expense of John McCain&#x27;s campaign message.&quot;
 A later article, however, stated that Scheunemann had not been fired, but that many of McCain&#x27;s top staff wanted him fired and removed his access to his campaign email and Blackberry.

==After 2008==
Scheunemann has been focusing on his consulting firm called Orion Strategies, not to be confused with the strategic communications firm Orion Strategies that is based out of West Virginia. In 2013 Scheunemann was involved in a verbal altercation with Richard B. Spencer on a chairlift at Whitefish Mountain Resort. Later in 2013 the two men were involved in another altercation at the Big Mountain Club at the resort, and had to be separated by staff. Scheunemann told staff that he would assault Spencer if he saw him again. Both men resigned from the club following the second incident.

<doc id="211381" wikidata="Q3138090" url="?curid=211381" title="Postage stamps and postal history of Canada">
<text>The postal and philatelic history of Canada concerns postage of the territories which have formed Canada. Before Canadian confederation, the colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland issued stamps in their own names. The postal history falls into four major periods: French control (1604–1763), British control (1763–1841), colonial government control (1841–1867), and Canada, since 1867.

== Origins ==
At St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland on 3 August 1527 the first known letter was sent from North America. While in St. John&#x27;s, John Rut had written a letter to King Henry VIII on his findings and his planned voyage. The letter in part reads as follows: &quot;Pleasing your Honourable Grace to heare of your servant John Rut with all his company here in good health thanks be to God.&quot; The conclusion of the letter reads:...the third day of August we entered into a good harbour called St. John and there we found Eleuen Saile of Normans and one Brittaine and two Portugal barks all a fishing and so we are ready to depart towards Cap de Bras that is 25 leagues as shortly as we have fished and so along the Coast until we may meete with our fellowe and so with all diligence that lyes in me toward parts to that Ilands that we are command at our departing and thus Jesu save and keepe you Honourable Grace and all your Honourable Reuer. In the Haven of St. John the third day of August written in hast 1527, by your servant John Rut to his uttermost of his power.

== French control ==
The earliest reference to a postal service is of couriers in 1705, namely the &quot;first courier&quot; Pedro da Silva, carrying the Governor&#x27;s dispatches by boat, along with (for a fee) private letters. A regular postal system was proposed in 1721, but would have been too expensive at the time, and was not created until 1734, when a road existed between Montreal and Quebec. Post houses were established at intervals of nine miles (14 km) or so, along with ferries across the rivers. Fees were ten sols between the two major cities, and five sols to Trois-Rivières, Quebec.

== British control ==
The British captured Montreal in 1760, and shortly thereafter established a military postal system that handled letters between Quebec and Montreal, and from Montreal to Albany, New York.

The peace treaty of 1763 inaugurated the development of a civilian post. The Postmasters General of the American colonies, Benjamin Franklin and William Foxcroft surveyed a route between New York and Quebec, and contracted Quebec-Montreal mail to a Hugh Finlay, who provided a weekly service at 8d per letter. Mail to New York took two weeks and cost about a shilling. The service was quite successful, the Quebec-Montreal route increasing to twice a week, and eventually branching out to include Skenesborough.

The American Revolutionary War disrupted mail to New York, and also showed the weakness in not having an all-British route to Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1787 a complicated route was set up through Riviere du Loup, Fredericton, Digby, and Annapolis. Upper Canada had its own semi-monthly route through Kingston, Niagara, Detroit, and as far as Michilimackinac on Lake Huron.

Finlay was succeeded in 1800 by George Heriot, then in 1816 Daniel Sutherland took over as Postmaster General. By this time dozens of post offices were being opened. 1816 was also when the postal services of Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia were separated, and not rejoined until 1868.

Postmarks had been in use since 1764, Finlay having been introduced to them by Franklin. The earliest markings were town names in a straight line. As is typical of the period, the postal service introduced ever-more-complicated systems of rates for mail, depending on destination and distance. In 1840 Rowland Hill proposed a uniform rate for Great Britain that could be prepaid by postage stamps, and on May 25, 1849, the Legislative Assembly of Canada resolved to adopt the use of stamps in the Province of Canada.

==Colonial Governments==
The colonies co-operated in the local control of the postal system after they assumed the administration from the General Post office in London in 1851, but each colony issued its own stamps until it joined Confederation. All colonies ceased issuing postage stamps after confederation.

=== British Columbia ===

The colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island jointly issued stamps valid in both colonies in 1860. In 1865, each colony issued its own series. After the two colonies were merged in 1866, the united colony issued stamps from 1867 to 1869.

=== Province of Canada ===

The Province of Canada began issuing stamps on April 23, 1851. The first were in the values of 3d, 6d, and 12d. Designed by Sir Sandford Fleming, the &quot;Threepenny Beaver&quot; depicted a beaver in an oval frame, and is considered the first Canadian postage stamp. It was the first stamp to picture an animal and not a monarch. It was the first official postage stamp anywhere to picture an animal, though an unofficial postmaster&#x27;s provisional from St. Louis, Missouri, showed two bears in 1845. The 6d was a portrait of Prince Albert from a drawing by William Drummond Esq. The 12d (1 shilling) was reproduced from a full-length painting of Queen Victoria done by Alfred Edward Chalon. All three stamps were produced by the firm of Rawdon, Wright, Hatch and Edson of New York.

In April 1851, the rate for inland letters to Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Cape Breton and Prince Edward Island was 3d per ½ oz. Letters to the USA was 6d per ½ oz, excluding California and Oregon, which was 9d per ½ oz. The first issues were made on laid paper, which did not stick as well to envelopes; thus in 1852 the printers switched to wove paper. All of these early stamps were imperforate issues. These earliest issues on laid paper are quite rare; a grand total of only 1,450 copies of the 12d were ever issued. Copies today, depending on their condition, may sell for US$50,000 or more.

Between 1852 and 1857, the postal service came out with new values: ½d, 7½d, and 10d, while removing the 12d. The first two depicting Victoria, and the 10d featuring a portrait of Jacques Cartier. The 7½d was unusual in that it was also denominated &quot;6 Pence Sterling&quot;. In 1858 the first perforated stamps were issued in ½d, 3d, and 6d values, depicting Queen Victoria, a beaver and HRH Prince Albert.

In 1859 the province standardized on a single decimal monetary system, which also meant new stamps would be needed. Between 1859 and 1864, the American Bank Note Company, New York produced seven new stamps in: 1¢, 2¢, 5¢, (two) 10¢, 12½¢, and 17¢ values. In general, existing designs were used. These were the last stamps produced for the Province of Canada.

=== New Brunswick ===

New Brunswick first issued stamps in 1851; they were imperforate and denominated in pence. They consisted of a 3d red, 6d olive yellow, 1/- bright red violet and a 1/- dull violet issues, all on bluish paper. All four stamps were diamond-shaped and bore the New Brunswick coat of arms. In 1860, six new stamps, denominated in cents, were issued. The 1¢ depicted a steam locomotive, the 2¢, 5¢, and 10¢ values showed a young Queen Victoria, while the 12½¢ depicted a steamship and the 17¢ showed the Prince of Wales in Highland regalia.

=== Newfoundland ===
The colony and later the dominion of Newfoundland had a 90-year history of issuing postage stamps. The first issues were in 1857. The last issue was in 1947, two years before Newfoundland joined the confederation. Newfoundland stamps remain valid for mail posted anywhere in Canada.

=== Nova Scotia ===

Nova Scotia&#x27;s first issue was from 1851 to 1857, in pence. The second issue, in cents, was from 1861 to 1863.

=== Prince Edward Island ===

Prince Edward Island issued stamps in pence from 1862 to 1865, and a second series from 1868 to 1870. The third series, in cents, was issued in 1872.

== Canada ==
=== Victorian period ===
The Dominion came into existence July 1, 1867, assembled from colonies each of which had their own stamps, so the new government issued a new series of stamps on April 1, 1868, superseding all previous issues. These featured a profile of Queen Victoria, based on an engraving by Charles Henry Jeens and became known to philatelists as the &quot;Large Queens&quot;. They ranged in value from ½¢ to 15¢. While mostly printed on wove paper, a few of the 1¢, 2¢, and 3¢ values were also printed on laid paper; only three examples of the Canada 2c Large Queen on laid paper are known, making it Canada&#x27;s rarest stamp.

Except for the 15c value which was in use as late as 1897, the Large Queens had a relatively short life, being replaced in 1870 by the &quot;Small Queens&quot;, smaller stamps of the same basic design, adopted to be able to produce more stamps more quickly. The Small Queens came in a number of printings between 1870 and 1897. In 1893 20¢ and 50¢ stamps came out with a 3/4 portrait of Victoria.

When Prince Edward Island became a Canadian province in 1873, it sold off all its remaining pre-Canadian stamps at discounted prices, flooding the market with over 1.5 million cheap stamps. Since these stamps had next to no value, forgers had no compelling reason to make copies. Today, since forged versions of Prince Edward Island stamps are harder to find than the original, the forgeries are more valuable. Library and Archives Canada holds a forged, lithographed version of a stamp from 1870 that features an engraving of Queen Victoria.

In 1897, the American Bank Note Company secured the contract to print stamps for Canada, which lasted until 1923. The company&#x27;s first job was to print a series for the Diamond Jubilee celebrating the 60th year of Queen Victoria and the 30th year of confederation, the first commemorative stamps of Canada. The design was a side-by-side of the Chalon vignette of the young Victoria and the likeness photographed by Alexander Bassano in 1887. The series included 16 denominations ranging from ½¢ to five dollars, a princely sum in those days, and more aimed at collectors than mailers. Only 9,937 of the $4 value were ever sold, and they are rare and expensive today.

1897 also saw the &quot;Maple Leaf Issue&quot;, regular stamps with the central design based on a Jubilee portrait for Victoria, with maple leaves in each corner. It was in use for only a few months before being replaced by a modified design that replaced the lower leaves with numerals of value, motivated by the French-speaking population who found it difficult to read the textual denomination on the original design. (The Universal Postal Union would require the use of Arabic numerals in 1907.)

In 1898, a first step towards Imperial Penny Postage happened when a number of Dominions agreed on a uniform rate of 1d (2¢ in Canada). Canada issued an interesting stamp depicting a map of the entire world, with British possessions marked in red, inscribed &quot;XMAS 1898&quot; (the rate took effect on Christmas Day), and &quot;WE HOLD A VASTER EMPIRE THAN HAS BEEN&quot; underneath, a line extracted from &quot;A Song of Empire&quot; composed by Sir Lewis Morris in 1887. The stamp was notable as the first multi-colour stamp of Canada, and also for the tremendous variability of the red highlighting, resulting in amusing geographical incongruities.

===Edward VII===
Upon the accession of King Edward VII, the basic maple leaf was retained but updated with a portrait of Edward wearing the ermine Robes of State. Seven stamps bearing Edward VII based upon his coronation painting were issued between 1903 and 1908. In addition, a commemorative stamp of Quebec&#x27;s Tercentenary was issued in 1908 featuring Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. Canada&#x27;s first experiments with coil stamps occurred during this period.

===George V===

King George V was depicted in 1911 as Admiral of the Fleet in a widely admired design that continued in use until 1928.

1928 saw the &quot;Scroll Issue&quot;, so-called because &quot;CANADA&quot; appeared in a scroll across the top. This was the first issue to be bilingual. The pictorials are among the finest stamps ever produced, especially the 50¢ value Bluenose stamp portraying the legendary schooner &quot;Bluenose&quot;.

The &quot;Arch Issue&quot; of 1930 was similarly elegant. The last issue for George V, in 1935, was called the &quot;Dated Die Issue&quot; because the year appeared in very small print in the design.

===Edward VIII===
No stamps were issued during the reign of Edward VIII since he abdicated the throne before the Coronation Ceremony took place.

===George VI===

The dated die concept was used in 1937 as well, in the stamps issued for newly crowned King George VI. A group of three stamps in May 1939 marked the royal visit and a commemorative cover was available postmarked from the Royal Train.

Soon after the Empire was plunged into war; the War issue of 1942 highlighted Canada&#x27;s contributions. While the low values showed the King wearing the uniforms of the different services, the higher values showed Canada&#x27;s role in growing food and the production of munitions, including a Ram tank, a corvette, and a destroyer.

In 1946, the &quot;Peace issue&quot; showed scenes and economic activities around the country. From the late 1940s on, the issuance of commemoratives became a regular event, with two in 1947, but gradually increasing. The last regular stamps of George VI came out in 1951.

===Elizabeth II===

The first definitive issue for Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign was based on a portrait by Yusuf Karsh, and was issued on a plain background in five values on May 1 1953.

The Karsh series was replaced in the following year by a new design based on the portrait by Dorothy Wilding that was also used in the United Kingdom. The 5¢ value was issued on April 1 with the introduction of the new domestic first class letter rate. Five more values in this series were introduced on June 10. With this series the post office began experimenting with fluorescence on stamps, resulting in a number of challenging varieties over the life of this and the next two series.

The Wilding series was replaced by the &quot;Cameo&quot; series, a horizontal design by Ernst Roch. The series began with the 5¢ value on 10 March 1962. The 1¢ and 4¢ values were released on 2 April 1963, and the 2¢ and 3¢ values followed on May 2.

From the 1960s on, Canadian stamp policies have favoured issuing a relatively large number of single commemoratives valued at the prevailing first-class rate. In its commemorative issues Canada has made extensive use of works by well-known artists and until very recently has not used images of living people on its stamps.

Definitive series have tended to be combinations of design types, each applying to a range of values. For instance, the definitives of the late 1980s featured native wildlife for values up to 80 cents, and Canadian architecture for the dollar values, while those of the early 1990s used berries for the lowest values, and fruit trees for the higher values, and continuing with architecture for the highest values.

In December 2003, Canada Post issued a new 49¢ definitive stamp bearing the image of Queen Elizabeth II using a photograph taken by rock star Bryan Adams. A similar redenominated stamp was issued in 2005 as a 50¢ denomination, and a 51¢ denomination in 2006 (see Queen Elizabeth II definitive stamp (Canada)).

===Charles III===
The first definitive issue for Charles III&#x27;s reign was unveiled by Canada Post on May 5, 2023, and became available for purchase on May 8, 2023. The definitive stamp features a portrait of His Majesty King Charles III, then The Prince of Wales, by photographer Alan Shawcross.

<text>Richard Green Lugar ( ; April 4, 1932 – April 28, 2019) was an American politician who served as a United States Senator from Indiana from 1977 to 2013. He was a member of the Republican Party.

Born in Indianapolis, Lugar graduated from Denison University and the University of Oxford. He served on the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners from 1964 to 1967 before he was elected to two terms as mayor of Indianapolis, serving from 1968 to 1976. During his tenure as mayor, Lugar served as the president of the National League of Cities in 1971 and gave the keynote address at the 1972 Republican National Convention.

In 1974, Lugar ran his first campaign for the U.S. Senate. In the year&#x27;s senate elections he lost to incumbent Democratic senator Birch Bayh. He ran again in 1976, defeating Democratic incumbent Vance Hartke. Lugar continued to be reelected until 2012, when he was defeated by Indiana State Treasurer Richard Mourdock in the Republican primary by 21 points, who subsequently lost in the general election to Democrat Joe Donnelly, ending his 36-year tenure in the U.S. Senate. Lugar ran for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 1996 primaries but lack of success led to his withdrawal early in the campaign.

During Lugar&#x27;s tenure, he served as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations from 1985 to 1987 and from 2003 to 2007, serving as the ranking member of the committee from 2007 until his departure in 2013. Lugar also twice served as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, from 1995 to 2001 and briefly again in part of 2001. Much of Lugar&#x27;s work in the Senate was toward the dismantling of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons around the world, co-sponsoring his most notable piece of legislation with Georgia Democrat Sam Nunn: the Nunn–Lugar Act.

Following his service in the Senate, Lugar created a nonprofit organization which specializes in the policy areas he pursued while in office.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Richard Lugar was born on April 4, 1932, in Indianapolis, Indiana, the son of Bertha (&quot;&quot; Green) and Marvin Lugar. He was of part German descent. Lugar attended Shortridge High School. During this time he attained the rank of Eagle Scout, the Boy Scouts&#x27; highest. Later, he became a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America. He graduated first in his class at Shortridge High School in 1950 and from Denison University in 1954, where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi. He went on to attend Pembroke College, Oxford, England, as a Rhodes Scholar and received a second bachelor&#x27;s degree and a master&#x27;s degree in 1956. At Oxford, Lugar was a member of the Oxford University men&#x27;s basketball team that won the 1955 A.B.B.A. National Championship. He served in the United States Navy from 1956 to 1960; one of his assignments was as an intelligence briefer for Admiral Arleigh Burke. He achieved the rank of Lieutenant, Junior Grade.

Lugar managed his family&#x27;s Marion County corn, soybean and tree farm. Before entering public life, he helped his brother Tom manage the family&#x27;s food machinery manufacturing business in Indianapolis.

==Indianapolis politics and mayorship==
Lugar served on the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners from 1964 to 1967. He was elected mayor of Indianapolis in 1967, at the age of 35, defeating incumbent Democrat John J. Barton, and began serving the first of two mayoral terms in 1968. (A political cartoon of the time questioned how an Eagle Scout could survive in the world of politics.) He was closely associated with the adoption of Unigov in 1970, which unified the governments of Indianapolis and Marion County. The Unigov plan helped trigger Indianapolis&#x27;s economic growth and earned Lugar the post of president of the National League of Cities in 1971. In 1972, Lugar was the keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention. During this time he became known as &quot;Richard Nixon&#x27;s favorite mayor&quot;, owing to his support for devolving federal powers to local communities. When Nixon visited Indianapolis in February 1970, he stated during a speech that he would meet with Lugar and other mayors ahead of a conference with Governors on environmental issues. On March 14, 1974, Lugar dismissed Police Chief Winston L. Churchill following allegations of widespread corruption in the Indianapolis Police Department. Lugar stated the dismissal came following meetings with dozens of policemen and after having had the counsel of a seven member committee of citizens to aid in the investigation.

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===

Lugar first ran for the U.S. Senate in the 1974 election and lost to incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Birch Bayh 51% to 46%. Two years later, he ran against Indiana&#x27;s other U.S. senator, Democratic Senator Vance Hartke, defeating him 59% to 40%.

In 1982, he defeated Democratic U.S. Congressman Floyd Fithian 54% to 46% to win a second term, and six years later Lugar won reelection to a third term, defeating Democrat Jack Wickes 68% to 32%. In 1994, Lugar won a fourth term, defeating Democratic former U.S. Congressman Jim Jontz (67–31%). He became the first U.S. senator from Indiana elected to a fourth term.

Lugar went on to serve a total of six terms in the Senate, defeating Democrat David Johnson 67% to 32% in 2000 and defeating Libertarian Steve Osborn 87% to 13% in 2006 in a contest in which the Democratic Party did not field a candidate. His was the highest-percentage win of the 2006 Senate elections despite a Democratic takeover of Washington.

In 2012, Lugar ran for reelection to a seventh term. Due to Lugar&#x27;s unpopularity among some Tea Party voters because of his positions regarding illegal immigration, voting to confirm then-U.S. Supreme Court nominees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the DREAM Act, the New START Treaty, some gun control bills, and congressional earmarks, he was challenged by Tea Party-backed State Treasurer Richard Mourdock in a Republican primary. Mourdock defeated Lugar, 61% to 39%, and went on to lose the general election to incumbent Democratic Representative Joe Donnelly. Lugar carried only two counties, Boone and Marion. He was the first six-term U.S. senator to lose his seat in a primary election since Kenneth McKellar in 1952.

===Tenure===
====1970s====
Future governor of Indiana Mitch Daniels served as Lugar&#x27;s chief of staff from 1977 to 1982. During the 1980 Republican National Convention, Lugar was rumored as a potential vice presidential nominee for presidential nominee Ronald Reagan.

In his first months, Lugar backed legislation prompting the Senate to adopt a stringent code of ethics intended to assist with the restoration of public confidence in Congress.

On June 30, 1978, the Senate voted to approve granting New York City long term federal loan guarantees of $1.5 billion that the city had cited as essential to its prevention of bankruptcy. The measure was a compromise proposal by Lugar and Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire. Later that day, during a news conference, Senator Jacob K. Javits thanked Lugar and Proxmire.

====1980s====
Lugar attended the January 7, 1980, signing ceremony of the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979 in the Cabinet Room. Lugar addressed President Jimmy Carter during the ceremony by thanking him for signing what Lugar called &quot;very humane and compassionate legislation&quot; that was important for the United States.

In the early months of the Reagan administration, Lugar supported its program to eliminate all restrictions on planting and marketing of peanuts. An April 30, 1981, vote by members of the Senate Agriculture Committee continued the restrictions.

On May 11, 1981, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted in favor of implementing restrictions on American aid to El Salvador requiring President Reagan to verify the Salvadorian government was using the funds to implement human rights along with political and economic changes. The measure was opposed by Lugar who voted against the entirety of its conditions.

Lugar was one of four senators on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to vote against the Senate rejecting the nomination of Ernest W. Lefever for Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights on June 5, 1981.

On October 15, 1981, Lugar voted against the recommendation of the disapproval toward the Reagan administration&#x27;s intent to sell Awacs radar surveillance planes and other air-combat equipment to Saudi Arabia.

On December 2, 1981, Lugar voted in favor of an amendment to President Reagan&#x27;s MX missiles proposal that would divert the silo system by $334 million as well as earmark further research for other methods that would allow giant missiles to be based. The vote was seen as a rebuff of the Reagan administration.

In 1982, Lugar cosponsored a housing bill that would provide middle-class purchasers of new homes with mortgage subsidies, which he referred to as &quot;an emergency jobs program&quot; that would provide 700,000 Americans with jobs in the housing and related industries while costing $5 billion over the following five years. The cancellation of an April meeting of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee to discuss how far-reaching the bill should be was seen as crippling to its chances of implementation.

On December 23, 1982, Lugar voted in favor of a 5 cent a gallon increase on gasoline taxes across the U.S. imposed to aid the financing of highway repairs and mass transit. The bill passed on the last day of the 97th United States Congress.

On July 13, 1983, Lugar voted in favor of an authorization to appropriate $130 million toward the development of nerve gas bombs and shells.

Lugar led the February 2, 1984, hearing of William A. Wilson, the nominee of President Reagan for United States Ambassador to the Holy See.

In March 1984, Lugar voted in favor of a constitutional amendment authorizing periods in public school for silent prayer, and President Reagan&#x27;s unsuccessful proposal for a constitutional amendment permitting organized school prayer in public schools.

Lugar voted against the May 1984 budget freeze meant to reduce the budget deficit.

United States Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole announced President Reagan&#x27;s support for legislation that would force states to raise the minimum drinking age to 21 during a news conference on June 13, 1984. Lugar was in attended the news conference and stated that Dole and himself had convinced President Reagan to change his mind through &quot;the work of groups like MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) and the concern of hundreds of high school organizations called SADD (Students Against Driving Drunk)&quot;. Lugar noted his commitment to working on bipartisan support for the legislation. The same month, Lugar voted in favor of legislation restricting federal highway funds for states that did not raise the minimum age for drinking to 21.

On May 9, 1986, Lugar held a news conference designed to coincide with the beginning of the Manila visit by Secretary of State George P. Shultz, during which he criticized the Reagan administration for what he perceived as a lack of support for the Philippine government under the rule of President of the Philippines Corazon Aquino and accused former Philippines President Ferdinand E. Marcos of using his Hawaii haven as an area to make hundreds of telephone calls to former allies still in Manila for the purpose of making his potential return to power of active speculation. The fiscal year of 1986 included the United States providing 236 million to the Philippines. President Reagan also sought an additional 100 million for economic aid and 50 million for military aid. During a June 3 panel on the subject of providing aid for Manila, Lugar stated his support for the United States providing another 100 million to the government of President Aquino and called on the chamber to recognize Aquino&#x27;s government &quot;is threatened not only by a communist insurgency but also by a possible challenge from the political right&quot;.

In November 1986, amid the Iran–Contra affair, Lugar stated that President Reagan did not understand the law requiring a president to inform Congress in a timely fashion over operations and that Reagan&#x27;s rhetoric on the third party arm shipments had been confusing. He also stressed that the president had not been damaged in his credibility. Around this time, Lugar conferred with John Poindexter, a key figure in the scandal. After the 1987 State of the Union Address, Lugar stated that he believed President Reagan had taken responsibility for the Iran–Contra affair by acknowledging that the deal had been unsuccessful.

The 1986 midterm election featured 22 of the 53 Senate Republicans up for reelection. In late 1984, Lugar predicted that &quot;a number of our people are not going to win in &#x27;86&quot; unless there was economic growth. The Republicans lost eight seats that election cycle. Shortly after the midterms, on November 13, it was disclosed that Senator Jesse Helms would challenge Lugar for ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Helms telling Lugar in a letter that the challenge would not have occurred had the Republicans maintained a majority in the Senate as &quot;the ranking minority post is a different matter&quot;. On January 6, 1987, Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted unanimously to retain Lugar as their ranking member. After the results, Lugar stated that he saw his win as a vote of confidence in his leadership.

In January 1988, the Senate began work on the ratification of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Later that month, Lugar met with German Minister for Foreign Affairs Hans-Dietrich Genscher to discuss the INF Treaty, Lugar stating afterward that he was confident the treaty would eventually be ratified despite developments in the process. Lugar believed technical errors existed within the treaty, aligning him with Senate critics of the measure, but differed from them on when they should be improved. Lugar voted in favor of the treaty in May when it passed overwhelmingly in the Senate on May 27.

Lugar attended the July 11, 1988, White House meeting on the subject of legislation to provide financial relief to farmers affected by the showers in the Midwestern and Southern United States, Lugar during which he indicated that there was willingness on the part of his political party to support the measure. On August 11, 1988, President Reagan signed the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 into law. During the ceremony, President Reagan noted Lugar as one of the members of Congress &quot;who&#x27;ve done so much to make this possible&quot;.

After Vice President George H. W. Bush selected Lugar&#x27;s fellow Indiana senator Dan Quayle for his running mate in the 1988 Presidential election, Lugar spoke with Bush by telephone, and the presidential candidate explained his pick of Quayle: &quot;The Vice President told me he wanted somebody of a distinctly different generation. It was obvious he felt that was more important than some other considerations. I certainly understand that.&quot; In a September 28, 1988, news conference, Democratic vice-presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen cited Lugar as one of three &quot;heavyweight&quot; Republican senators who were more qualified for the vice presidential nomination than Quayle. On December 12, 1988, Lugar attended Vice President-elect Quayle&#x27;s first news conference following the election, during which Quayle stated the Bush administration would be seeking his aid along with that of Dan Coats in pushing their agenda through Congress.

====1990s====
In February 1990, Lugar announced that the congressional group President Bush named to observe Nicaragua elections the following month was disbanded following their being denied visas by the Nicaraguan government.

In 1990, after President Bush nominated James E. Cason to be Assistant Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, the latter received scrutiny for his record during the Reagan administration. During a September hearing, Lugar &quot;asked a series of probing questions on the spotted owl&quot;, and questioned him during a hearing the following month regarding his record at the Interior Department. On October 19, 1990, the Senate Agriculture Committee voted to recommend Cason for Assistant Agriculture Secretary.

on August 21, 1990, Lugar told reporters that the move to a marketing economy on the part of Vietnam had created the possibility for American investment provided that differences between Washington and Hanoi be resolved.

On October 2, 1990, Lugar voted in favor of the nomination of David Souter for Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court.

In November 1990, amid President Bush&#x27;s handling of the Persian Gulf crisis, Lugar observed that President Bush should &quot;call back the Congress and get an affirmative vote to authorize our staying power over there so that the world knows that we&#x27;re going to back up whatever the President is doing.&quot;

In June 1991, Lugar joined fellow Senators William Cohen and John Warner in revealing their dissent with space-based weapons, a central component of the Bush administration&#x27;s version of the Strategic Defense Initiative, in a letter and speeches. The three offered an alternative that &quot;would defer the deployment of 1,000 missile-destroying rockets in space, while calling for greater levels of ground-based missile defenses&quot;.

On November 25, 1991, the Senate voted in favor of approving the Bush administration-backed package to transfer $500 million of the Pentagon budget to assist with dismantling Soviet nuclear weapons. In support of the measure, Lugar said, &quot;We can either seize the opportunity for cooperative efforts in this field now or witness a quantum leap in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the next few years.&quot;

During the 1992 election cycle, Lugar stated President Bush needed to signal that his reelection campaign was &quot;a new campaign with a new game plan and a new vigor&quot; and the best results would be formed through a message on &quot;growth and jobs&quot;.

In February 1993, after Secretary of State Warren Christopher declared that the United States would only use military power in seeking a settlement as it pertained to Bosnia, Lugar&#x27;s spokesman stated that during a telephone conversation between Christopher and Lugar, the secretary of state said &quot;that the United States could contribute as many as 5,000 to 10,000 American troops to a 40,000-member NATO force that would go to Bosnia under United Nations auspices after a new peace accord is concluded&quot;. Lugar attended the April 28, 1993, meeting between President Clinton and lawmakers over American involvement in Bosnia. Following its conclusion, Lugar stated the president&#x27;s views: &quot;He had a positive feeling towards lifting the embargo—that justice has to be served in that respect. But the President was much less certain about heading down the trail of air strikes.&quot; Weeks later, on May 11, Lugar met with President Clinton on the subject of Bosnia, Lugar stating afterward that President Clinton had developed &quot;a plan that he has been pushing steadily&quot; and was in favor of containing the Bosnia disaster. Lugar was of the view that the United States wanted a full partnership with Europeans that could only arise from &quot;recognition on their side that our men and women in the armed forces are taking risks right now&quot;.

On November 20, 1993, Lugar voted in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The trade agreement linked the United States, Canada, and Mexico into a single free trade zone, and was signed into law on December 8 by President Clinton.

In December 1994, President Clinton announced the nomination of Dan Glickman for Secretary of Agriculture. During the ceremony, Glickman stated that agriculture should not be immune to change and cited Lugar as an official &quot;asking good questions about the next farm bill&quot;. During a March 1995 Senate hearing, Lugar indicated his distaste with Glickman not supporting the latest accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade the previous November. Lugar afterward spoke positively of Glickman.

On August 3, 1997, Lugar stated his support for convening a hearing for William Weld for United States Ambassador to Mexico and overlook Senator Jesse Helms, noting that a Senate chairman &quot;cannot be dictatorial, ultimately, when a majority of the committee, a majority of the Senate, a majority of the American people, want action&quot;.

On February 12, 1999, Lugar voted in favor of both articles of impeachment against President Clinton, calling his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky &quot;shameless, reckless and indefensible&quot;, and criticizing him for creating a negative environment.

In October 1999, Lugar voted against the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The treaty was designed to ban underground nuclear testing and was the first major international security pact to be defeated in the Senate since the Treaty of Versailles.

====2000–2008====
During the August recess of 2005, Lugar and then-freshman Senator Barack Obama of neighboring Illinois visited Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine to inspect nuclear facilities there. He was detained for three hours at an airport in the city of Perm, near the Ural Mountains, where they were scheduled to depart for a meeting with the President and the Speaker of the House of Ukraine. He was released after a brief dialogue between U.S. and Russian officials and the Russians later apologized for the incident. In January 2007, President Bush signed into law the Lugar–Obama Proliferation and Threat Reduction Initiative, which furthered Lugar&#x27;s work with Senator Sam Nunn in deactivating weapons in the former Soviet Union. The Lugar–Obama program focuses on terrorists and their use of multiple types of weapons. In April 2006, &quot;Time&quot; magazine selected Lugar as one of America&#x27;s 10 Best Senators.Although Lugar&#x27;s party was then in the minority in the Senate, he had good relationships with President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. Lugar was named an honorary co-chairman of their inauguration. On the day of the final 2008 presidential debate, Lugar gave a speech at the National Defense University praising Obama&#x27;s foreign policy approach and warning against the isolationist, reactive policies espoused by John McCain. At that debate, Obama also listed Lugar as among the individuals &quot;who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House&quot;. There were rumors that either Obama or McCain would select Lugar to be Secretary of State, but that he preferred to keep his Senate seat.

==== Obama administration ====
On January 13, 2009, Lugar participated in the confirmation hearing for Secretary of State nominee Hillary Clinton, raising questions on the potential conflict of interest between her husband Bill&#x27;s charitable activities and her new position. Lugar offered praise to Clinton as &quot;the epitome of a big leaguer&quot;. Lugar&#x27;s spokesman Andy Fisher said that before the hearing, Lugar offered Clinton&#x27;s staff four ways in which to increase the transparency of former President Clinton&#x27;s fundraising.

On March 18, 2009, Lugar cast his 12,000th Senate vote, putting him in 13th place for most votes. During his 32 years as a Senator, he had a 98% attendance record.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry
* Committee on Foreign Relations

==1996 presidential campaign==

Lugar ran for the Republican nomination for President in 1996. He declared his candidacy on April 19, 1995, in Indianapolis. However, the announcement was largely overshadowed by the Oklahoma City bombing, an event that was the largest act of domestic terrorism on U.S. soil up to that time. The primaries and caucuses began in January 1996. He ran on a campaign slogan of &quot;nuclear security and fiscal sanity&quot;, but his campaign failed to gain traction.

He came in 7th in the Iowa caucuses on February 12 with 4%, and 4th in the New Hampshire primary on February 20 with 5%. In the Delaware primary on February 24 he also won 5%, and in the Arizona and North Dakota primaries on February 27 he came in last with 1%. He was on the ballot in seven of the nine contests on Super Tuesday on March 5, winning 1% in Colorado, Connecticut, and Maryland, 2% in Massachusetts, 3% in Maine and Rhode Island and 14% in Vermont, which was the best result he managed, though he still only came in 4th. He quit the race the next day, March 6. Lugar&#x27;s fellow senator, and eventual Republican nominee, Bob Dole, had won all nine contests and Lugar endorsed him.

He remained on the ballot in a number of states, winning 2% of the vote in Florida, then 1% each in Oregon, Illinois, Ohio, and California, 5% in Pennsylvania and 1% in North Carolina and West Virginia. He finished sixth overall, with 127,111 votes, or 0.83%, and failed to win any contests or delegates. Due to an unfavorable political climate that penalized bipartisan outcomes, David Corn of &quot;Mother Jones&quot; called his presidential campaign &quot;ludicrous&quot;.

==Post-Senate career==
On February 15, 2018, Lugar made a joint appearance with Lee H. Hamilton at DePauw University for the program &quot;Can We Talk?: Restoring Civility in Public and Political Discourse in the U.S. and Abroad&quot;.

===The Lugar Center===

Following his service in the Senate, Lugar established The Lugar Center, a nonprofit public policy institution located in Washington, D.C.

Under the leadership of Lugar, the Lugar Center seeks to become a prominent voice in many of the global issues that defined the Senator&#x27;s work in Congress. There are four &quot;focus areas&quot;: Global Food Security, WMD Nonproliferation, Foreign Aid Effectiveness, and Bipartisan Governance. Since its inception in January 2013, the Lugar Center has served as a source of education and awareness on these pertinent issues.

The Center&#x27;s initiatives include the following: working in conjunction with the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University to establish the Bipartisan Index, partnering with the Arms Control Association to establish the Bipartisan Nuclear and WMD Policy Dialogue Project, and compiling a comprehensive selection of bibliographical resources for researchers and policymakers interested in global food security. In addition, the Lugar Diplomacy Series brings together American policy- and opinion-makers and the Washington diplomatic community. Guests have included Elena Kagan, David Petraeus, and Howard Buffett.

In addition, the Lugar Center was awarded a grant by the Delegation of the European Union to conduct policy research regarding transatlantic cooperation. The grant permitted the Center to partner with the German Marshall Fund of the United States to work on bolstering trans-Atlantic energy security and economic cooperation, particularly in relation to the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.

==Political positions==

===Abortion===
Lugar&#x27;s 2007 rating from NARAL was 40%. His 2007–2008 rating from the National Right to Life Committee was 85%.

===Agricultural reform===
As Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Lugar built bipartisan support for 1996 federal farm program reforms, ending 1930s-era federal production controls. He worked to initiate a biofuels research program to help increase U.S. utilization of ethanol and combustion fuels, and led initiatives to streamline the U.S. Department of Agriculture, reform the food stamp program, and preserve the federal school lunch program.
=== Bipartisan governance ===
Although Republican, Lugar often worked across the aisle, working alongside Democrats on many initiatives. For this reason, he commonly broke with traditional Republican lines, especially on non-domestic issues. Lugar&#x27;s most well-known piece of legislation, the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Agreement, was co-sponsored with Sam Nunn, a Democratic Senator from Georgia. Lugar&#x27;s bipartisan efforts earned him 24th place of 227 Senators&#x27; lifetime scores from 1993 to 2014 according to the Lugar Bipartisan Index, with a score of .668. Lugar continued to support bipartisan solutions and initiatives as one of the policy focus areas of The Lugar Center.

=== Climate change ===
Lugar was a firm believer in pragmatic, scientific solutions to climate change issues. In 2006, he co-sponsored Senate Resolution 312 with then-Senator Joe Biden, which encouraged American participation in international negotiations regarding mitigation agreements. Until his death, he continued to support multilateral initiatives for the deployment of innovative clean technology around the world.

===Cuba===
 Lugar described U.S. sanctions on Cuba as a failed policy and wrote to President Obama that &quot;additional measures are needed...to recast a policy that has not only failed to promote human rights and democracy, but also undermines our broader security and political interests&quot;. He supported the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act (S.428), which would lift the restrictions on U.S. citizens visiting Cuba in place since the early 1960s.

===Economy===
Lugar took a conservative approach to economics. He voted for the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. He voted against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

===Gun control===
Lugar was a supporter of gun control and backed a number of gun legislations and weapons bans. He had an F rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund. He had an F rating from Gun Owners of America and a 53% positive rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Handgun Violence.

===Health care reform===
Lugar opposed President Barack Obama&#x27;s health reform legislation, voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

===Immigration===
Lugar had a generally liberal stance on immigration, supporting the DREAM Act during the Obama administration and the McCain–Kennedy Comprehensive Immigration Reform bill under the Bush administration, both of which died in Congress. Both were described by critics as &quot;amnesty&quot;.

===Iraq War===

On June 25, 2007, Lugar, who had been &quot;a reliable vote for President Bush on the war&quot;, said that &quot;Bush&#x27;s Iraq strategy [is] not working and... the United States should downsize the military&#x27;s role&quot;.

Lugar&#x27;s blunt assessment has been viewed as significant because it showed the growing impatience and dissatisfaction with President Bush&#x27;s strategy in Iraq. After Lugar finished his remarks, Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin (D-IL), a sharp critic of the war, praised Lugar&#x27;s &quot;thoughtful, sincere and honest&quot; speech, which Durbin said was in the &quot;finest tradition of the U.S. Senate&quot;. Durbin urged his Senate colleagues to take a copy of Lugar&#x27;s speech home over the Fourth of July break and study it before returning to work. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, in reaction to Lugar&#x27;s speech: &quot;When this war comes to an end, and it will come to an end, and the history books are written, and they will be written, I believe that Sen. Lugar&#x27;s words yesterday could be remembered as a turning point in this intractable civil war in Iraq.&quot;

Two days later, on June 27, 2007, Lugar said that Congressional measures aimed at curtailing U.S. military involvement in Iraq – including &quot;so-called timetables, benchmarks&quot; – have &quot;no particular legal consequence&quot;, are &quot;very partisan&quot;, and &quot;will not work&quot;.

===Judicial nominees===
Lugar believed that judicial confirmation decisions should not be purely partisan. His view was if an appointee is properly qualified for the position, that the Senate should show deference to the president and confirm their nomination.

Lugar introduced President George W. Bush&#x27;s nominee for chief justice, John Roberts, to the Senate at the beginning of Roberts&#x27;s confirmation process and was instrumental in securing votes to confirm Roberts to the Supreme Court. Lugar was among the few Republican Senators to support President Barack Obama&#x27;s first Supreme Court nominee United States Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Sonia Sotomayor, and also voted in favor of his second Supreme Court nominee, Solicitor General Elena Kagan. Lugar was one of only nine senators to vote against Bill Clinton&#x27;s nomination of Stephen Breyer to the Supreme Court. Lugar was the first United States Senator to declare their opposition to Breyer&#x27;s nomination, citing, &quot;substantial doubts about his prudence and good judgement.&quot; This was the only one of the thirteen Supreme Court confirmation votes which took place during Lugar&#x27;s tenure in which he cast a vote against the nomination.

===LGBT issues===
Lugar held a socially conservative approach on LGBT issues. He voted for the Federal Marriage Amendment, limiting the definition of marriage to one man and one woman. However, he has also voted in favor of the Matthew Shepard Act, which expanded the federal hate crime statutes to include sexual orientation and gender identity. In October 2010, Lugar voted against repeal of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell policy—which prevented gays and lesbians from serving openly in the armed forces. Although Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut announced on November 18, 2010, that Lugar promised to vote to repeal the policy the next time it comes up for a vote,
Lugar voted against DADT repeal in both the cloture and final votes on December 18, 2010.

=== Middle East ===
In a television interview on September 11, 1983, amid President Reagan not defining the penalties for American casualties in the Middle East, Lugar stated the US position in Lebanon was &quot;clearly defensive&quot;, but concurred that issue was debatable.

On May 6, 1986, Lugar was among 22 senators to vote in favor of the Reagan administration-backed proposed arms sale to Saudi Arabia, warning other senators prior to voting that they &quot;were taking a headlong plunge in opposition to the President of the United States&quot;. Lugar and fellow Senator Bob Dole, both of whom supported the arms sale proposal, stated that President Reagan would be crippled in his role in the Middle East peace settlement in the event that he was unable to deliver a reduced arms package to the moderate Arab state.

On August 7, 2012, Lugar called for the United States and Russia to work in collaboration to eliminate the stockpile of chemical weapons in Syria during an interview. He noted that the proposal had been turned down by Russian officials, who noted Syria had not previously supported the Chemical Weapons Convention, and that other countries saw the stockpile of Syrian weapons as &quot;influencing very adversely the potential for peace and stability in the Middle East&quot;.

===Nuclear stockpile===

Lugar was influential in gaining Senate ratification of treaties to reduce the world&#x27;s use, production and stockpiling of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and spearheaded many bipartisan nonproliferation initiatives. In 1991 he initiated a partnership with then-Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn aiming to eliminate latent weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union. To date, the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program has deactivated more than 7,500 nuclear warheads. In 2004, Lugar and Nunn were jointly awarded the Heinz Awards Chairman&#x27;s Medal for their efforts. He was an integral figure in the passing of the New START Treaty (which passed 71–26).

===Pakistan===
In October 2008, Lugar and Joe Biden, his partner in the Committee on Foreign Relations, received the Hilal-i-Pakistan (Crescent of Pakistan) Award from the government of Pakistan for their continued support of the country. In July 2008 Lugar and Biden introduced a plan that would give $1.5 billion in aid per year to support economic development in Pakistan.

=== Other international policy achievements ===
Senator Lugar supported Nelson Mandela&#x27;s fight against South African apartheid. When President Reagan vetoed economic sanctions against South African leaders as a punitive measure for apartheid, Lugar turned against his own party and led the charge to overrule the veto successfully with bipartisan support. As Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he declared on the Senate floor, &quot;We are against tyranny, and there is tyranny in South Africa.&quot;

Lugar was also instrumental to the fall of the dictatorial Marcos regime in the Philippines and overseeing the 1985 presidential election there, urging intervention from the Reagan administration.

In addition, Lugar coauthored the Cardin–Lugar Amendment to the Dodd–Frank Act, which required all U.S.-listed oil and mining companies to report their payments to governments. Nearly identical pro-transparency measures, aimed at curbing natural resource-related corruption in the developing world, were subsequently adopted by the European Union and Canada, making extractive industry payment disclosure a global standard.

=== Views on Trump administration ===
In a November 2017 interview, Lugar stated that President Donald Trump had not &quot;demonstrated civility in his leadership&quot; and that his usage of Twitter and &quot;other bombastic avenues&quot; were not solving issues.

==Electoral history==



















==Awards and honors==

Lugar received numerous awards, including Guardian of Small Business, the Spirit of Enterprise, Watchdog of the Treasury, and 46 honorary doctorate degrees. In 1970, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2001, Lugar received the Democracy Service Medal of the National Endowment for Democracy. In 2010, Lugar received the Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site Advancing American Democracy Award. In June 2012, he was conferred with the Grand Collar of the Order of Lakandula by President Benigno S. Aquino III for his contributions to the enhancement of the Philippine-US alliance and friendship as well as Poland&#x27;s Knight of Freedom Award for his actions and support of the Polish accession process to NATO structures.

On August 8, 2013, President Barack Obama named Lugar as a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The award ceremony was held November 20 of that year, the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The citation in the press release read as follows:

Lugar was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) for his efforts to reduce Weapons of Mass Destruction and supporting NATO. Lugar was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit, from Germany, in 2013, for his work on fostering transatlantic cooperation. In 2014, Lugar received the Golden Laurel Branch award, the highest honor given by the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Lugar was recognized for his contributions to Bulgaria&#x27;s accession to NATO.

In August 2016, President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine awarded Richard Lugar with the highest award for foreigners — Order of Liberty. In November 2016 he was awarded the 2016 J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding. In 2005, Lugar was presented the Lifetime Contributions to American Diplomacy Award by the American Foreign Service Association.

==Other outside activities==
Lugar was a member the Indiana Society of the Sons of the American Revolution, as well as a member of the Society of Indiana Pioneers, based on his descent from very early settlers in the state. He joined the Rotary Club of Indianapolis in 1957 and spoke at the club annually during his time in the U.S. Senate. He remained an active Rotarian. On February 16, 2013, Lugar was named the Rotarian of the Century. He served on the board of directors of the National Endowment for Democracy from 1992 to 2001.

Lugar was a member of the board of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, an organization involved in international elections. He was a member of the board of the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI). Lugar was on the Board of Selectors of the Jefferson Awards for Public Service.

==Richard G. Lugar Center for Public Health Research==
A biological research facility in Tbilisi, Georgia, is named after Lugar in honor of his efforts to reduce nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons around the world. The Richard G. Lugar Center for Public Health Research is a biological research facility funded by the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to contain and house dangerous pathogens and support international research efforts. It and other upgraded bio-threat reduction facilities in the region are designed to stop diseases like plague and African swine fever from spreading globally.

Lugar, utilizing the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program (CTR) which helped former Soviet Union states dismantle weapons of mass destruction after the Cold War, worked with the country of Georgia on biosafety, biosecurity and biosurveillance efforts through CTR&#x27;s Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP). The main goal was to improve the biosafety, biosecurity, disease surveillance, and establish the Central Public Health Reference Laboratory.

In 2012, Georgian authorities renamed the facility the Richard G. Lugar Center for Public Health Research; it belongs to and is run by the Georgian National Center for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC). In 2014, then-U.S. Ambassador to Georgia at the time, Richard Norland, signed an agreement with then-Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili to transfer custody of the Center to the NCDC during the 2014 World Congress on Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Science &amp; Consequence Management. At the invitation of the Georgian government, a contingent of U.S. scientists from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Global Disease Detection Program, and the U.S. Walter Reed Army Institute of Research are co-located in the facility. They work collaboratively alongside their Georgian counterparts.

==Personal life and death==
Lugar married Charlene Smeltzer on September 8, 1956. The couple had four sons. He was a member of the United Methodist Church.

Lugar died in Falls Church, Virginia, on April 28, 2019, shortly after his 87th birthday, from complications of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy==
John T. Shaw assessed the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction as Lugar&#x27;s landmark legislative accomplishment. The initiative would later be considered &quot;one of the most prescient pieces of legislation ever passed, and the most important nonproliferation program ever&quot;.

In 2000, Eric Schmitt described Lugar as &quot;a four-term senator, former presidential candidate and perhaps the most popular politician in Indiana history&quot;. Following Lugar&#x27;s 2012 Senate loss, Peter Rusthoven stated, &quot;Historically, this is not just one of the great senators now. This is one of the great senators in United States history. He is like a Daniel Webster, he is like a Henry Clay—names that I fear too many of our kids in grade school and high school don&#x27;t even know anymore.&quot;

Lugar&#x27;s defeat in the 2012 Senate Republican primary was written of as a sign of the national GOP base&#x27;s escalation into strict support for the traditional views aligned with the right. Former Senator John Danforth said the loss told him &quot;that there is an attempt by a lot of people to purge the Republican Party and to kick out of it people who do not hue a very strict party line&quot;. Geoffrey Kabaservice cast doubts on this view: &quot;It may be that his bipartisanship and comparative moderation contributed to his loss, or his defeat may simply have reflected the political truism that young blood drives out the old. What&#x27;s certain is that the Senate will miss his qualities, and in time so may we all.&quot;

On November 18, 2019, Secretary of the Navy Richard V. Spencer announced that the guided missile destroyer &quot;USS Richard G. Lugar&quot; (DDG-136) would be named in the late senator&#x27;s honor.

In Indianapolis, a city park and a public housing apartment building are named in honor of Lugar. On the campus of Indiana University in Bloomington, the School of Global &amp; International Studies was renamed to honor Lugar and former U.S. Congressman Lee Hamilton.

He then returned to Pennsylvania and completed his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at the Dickinson School of Law, graduating in 1972, and entered private practice.

As assistant district attorney in Erie, Ridge ran for Congress in his district, where he served six terms. He then ran for governor in 1994, despite being little-known outside of northwest Pennsylvania. He won the election, and was reelected in 1998 with the most votes for a Republican governor in Pennsylvania (where Democrats outnumbered Republicans by almost 500,000) in more than half a century. As Governor of Pennsylvania, he is credited for statewide advances in economic development, education, health care and the environment. As of , he is the last Republican to win reelection as Pennsylvania&#x27;s governor.

Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush named Ridge the first director of the newly created Office of Homeland Security. In January 2003, the Office of Homeland Security became an official Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and Ridge became the first Secretary of Homeland Security. He served in these roles for Bush&#x27;s first term as president, then retired and returned to the private sector.

Since reentering the private sector, Ridge has served on the boards of The Home Depot, The Hershey Company and Exelon Corporation and as a senior advisor to Deloitte &amp; Touche and TechRadium. He is also the founder and chairman of Ridge Global, a Washington, D.C.–based security consulting firm. He spent time campaigning with Senator John McCain during his 2008 presidential bid and was believed by some to have been on the short list of potential running mates.

==Early life and education==
Ridge was born in Munhall, Pennsylvania, in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Steel Valley, the eldest of three children. His parents were Laura (née Sudimack) and Thomas Regis Ridge, who was a traveling salesman and Navy veteran. Ridge&#x27;s maternal grandparents were Rusyn immigrants from the former Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia), and his paternal great-grandparents emigrated from Great Britain. He was raised in veterans&#x27; public housing in Erie, Pennsylvania. He was educated at St. Andrews Elementary School and Cathedral Preparatory School and did well both academically and in sports. He attended Harvard College, where he paid his way through with construction work, played intramural baseball and football, and graduated with honors in 1967. In 1968, after his first year at the Dickinson School of Law, he was drafted into the United States Army.

==Military service in Vietnam==
Ridge waived an opportunity for officer training school because it would have required a longer service commitment. In November 1969, Ridge arrived as a sergeant in South Vietnam where he would serve for six months as a staff sergeant with Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry, 11th Infantry Brigade, 23rd Infantry Division (Americal Division) during the Vietnam War.

In May 1970, a ruptured appendix cut short his tour of duty in Vietnam and he was sent home; his service also aggravated a childhood ear infection which caused him afterwards to have a hearing aid in his left ear.

For his service in Vietnam, Ridge received the Bronze Star with &quot;V&quot; Device, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation with Palm, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge.

===Military awards===


==Legal career==
After returning to Pennsylvania, he completed his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at the Dickinson School of Law, graduating in 1972, and entered private practice.

Ridge became assistant district attorney in Erie County, Pennsylvania, in 1980 and prosecuted 86 cases in two years.

==Elected office==


===U.S. House of Representatives===
In 1982, Ridge won a seat in Congress from northwestern Pennsylvania by the margin of only 729 votes. He was then re-elected five times.

===Governor===
In 1994, despite being little-known outside of northwest Pennsylvania, Ridge ran for governor. He won the election as a pro-choice Republican. He was reelected in 1998 with 57 percent of the vote in a four-way race. His share of the vote in that election was the highest for a Republican governor in Pennsylvania (where Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost 500,000) in more than half a century.

During his time as governor, Ridge promoted &quot;law and order&quot; policies, supporting a three-strikes law and a faster death penalty process. A death penalty supporter, Ridge signed more than 224 execution warrants – five times the number signed over a 25-year period by the two previous governors – but only three voluntary executions were carried out. On social issues, he opposed same-sex marriage while supporting abortion rights.

Over Ridge&#x27;s tenure, the Commonwealth&#x27;s budget grew by two to three percent per fiscal year and combined tax reductions totaled over $2 billion. Ridge created and grew a &quot;Rainy Day&quot; Fund balance to over $1 billion to be utilized during an economic downturn or recession.

Ridge pushed for legislation permitting competition among electric utilities and enhanced federal and state support for the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). He separated the Commonwealth&#x27;s environmental regulatory and conservation programs into two new agencies; the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.

Ridge proposed the creation of public charter schools in Pennsylvania and in establishing alternate schools for disruptive students. He launched new academic standards that established academic expectations for what students were expected to know in different grades. He proposed a school choice demonstration program.

Ridge oversaw a number of e-government projects including renewing drivers&#x27; licenses and vehicle registrations to viewing historical documents and library catalogs. The Commonwealth&#x27;s portal won several national awards. One of the nation&#x27;s first electronic grant systems was put into place at the Pennsylvania Department of Education. He created the Link-to-Learn initiative to increase the effective use of technology in public schools and universities.

Ridge signed two death warrants for African-American civil rights activist Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of killing a police officer at a traffic stop.

He served as governor until his resignation in 2001, at which time he became the Director of Homeland Security following the September 11 attacks.

==2000 presidential election==

Ridge was a potential running mate for Bob Dole in 1996, and served as a close advisor to Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush, a close friend from their simultaneous tenures as governors, during the 2000 presidential campaign. In return, Bush named Ridge to his short list for possible running mates, along with New York Governor George Pataki, Michigan Governor John Engler, Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, former Missouri Senator John Danforth, and former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole.

==Homeland Security==
Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush created the Office of Homeland Security within the White House, and named Ridge to head it. The charge to the nation&#x27;s new director of homeland security was to develop and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to strengthen the United States against terrorist threats or attacks. Ridge formally resigned as Pennsylvania&#x27;s governor on October 5, 2001.

In January 2003 and after the passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Office of Homeland Security split into a Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House Homeland Security Advisory Council. Ridge left the White House and became the first Secretary of Homeland Security. The department&#x27;s mission &quot;is to (A) prevent terrorist attacks within the United States; (B) reduce the vulnerability of the United States to terrorism; and (C) minimize the damage, and assist in the recovery, from terrorist attacks that do occur within the United States&quot; (From H.R. 5005-8 the Homeland Security Act of 2002). The newly created department was the most comprehensive reorganization of the Federal government since the National Security Act of 1947.

The Department of Homeland Security consolidates 22 agencies and 180,000 employees, unifying once-fragmented Federal functions in a single agency dedicated to protecting America from terrorism. Ridge worked with the employees from combined agencies to strengthen borders, provide for intelligence analysis and infrastructure protection, improve the use of science and technology to counter weapons of mass destruction, and to create a comprehensive response and recovery division.

In January 2004, Ridge was named among others in a lawsuit filed by a Syrian-born Canadian Maher Arar who said he was tortured in Syria after being deported by American authorities.

==Retirement from public office and book==

On November 30, 2004, Ridge submitted his resignation to the President, saying, &quot;After more than 22 consecutive years of public service, it is time to give personal and family matters a higher priority.&quot;

In his book &quot;The Test of Our Times: America Under Siege...and How We Can Be Safe Again&quot;, Ridge says his resignation was due to an effort by senior Bush administration officials to raise the nation&#x27;s terror alert level in the days before the 2004 presidential vote.

==Work in the private sector==

Ridge is the founder and chairman of Ridge Global, an advisory firm in Washington, D.C.

Ridge served on a state-appointed incident review panel that investigated the Virginia Tech shooting.

Ridge also sits on the board of directors of the Atlantic Council.

===Ridge Policy Group===
In 2010, Ridge&#x27;s two former Chiefs of Staff, Mark Campbell and Mark Holman, opened a lobbying firm after Ridge lent the firm his name. The full-service government affairs firm has offices in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C.

In July 2010, companies seeking to use hydraulic fracturing to extract natural gas from the Marcellus Shale formation engaged Ridge and Ridge Policy Group at $75,000 a month to help them gain support.

===Board memberships and other corporate associations===

Ridge has served on a variety of corporate boards of directors and in other roles. In 2005, he was named to the board of Home Depot, with an expected annual compensation of about $100,000. and in the same year was appointed to the board of the RFID company Savi Technology. He was appointed to the board of directors of the Exelon Corporation electric utility in 2006, with starting director compensation of $35,000 annual retainer plus a $1,500 meeting fee or per diem fee and (at the time) $60,000 in annual deferred stock units. In 2006, Ridge was announced as a senior advisor for Deloitte &amp; Touche USA LLP. He was named to serve on the executive board of The Hershey Company in 2007, and was named senior advisor to Texas-based security technology company TechRadium, Inc. in 2008. In 2009, antimicrobial company PURE Bioscience named Ridge, along with former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson, to its advisory board. He currently sits on the bipartisan advisory board of States United Democracy Center.

==Political activity==

===2008 presidential election===
Ridge served as a senior aide to Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain of Arizona, and was considered by some as a possible running mate for McCain. 

===Speculated 2010 Senate candidacy===
According to Fox News, many Republicans hoped Ridge would run for the United States Senate against the newly turned Democrat Arlen Specter, who stated he would seek re-election in 2010 in the Democratic primary. Already seeking the Republican nomination was former Representative Pat Toomey, who narrowly lost to Specter in the Republican primary in 2004. Some Republicans thought Ridge would have a better chance against Specter than would Toomey. A Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll conducted between April 30, 2009, and May 3, 2009, placed Ridge within three points of Specter in a hypothetical matchup between the two men.

Some Toomey supporters criticized the idea of a Ridge candidacy because, although Ridge was still registered to vote in Pennsylvania, he was actually living in Chevy Chase, Maryland. On May 7, 2009, Ridge announced that he would not be a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2010.

===2012 presidential election===
In September 2011, Ridge endorsed the campaign of former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman in the 2012 election. Mitt Romney announced an endorsement from Ridge on March 14, 2012.

===Supreme Court brief===
In 2013, Ridge was a signatory to an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; case.

===Stance on the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran===
Ridge spoke at a conference in support of the removal of the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK, also PMOI, MKO) from the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations. The group was listed on the State Department list from 1997 until September 2012. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported a senior Clinton administration official as saying inclusion of the People&#x27;s Mojahedin was intended as a goodwill gesture to Tehran and its newly elected president, Mohammad Khatami. Ridge, along with other former government officials and politicians Ed Rendell, R. James Woolsey, Porter Goss, Louis Freeh, Michael Mukasey, James L. Jones, Rudy Giuliani, and Howard Dean, have spoken in support of the group. Ridge and others wrote an article for the conservative publication &quot;National Review&quot; stating their position that the group should not be classified as a terrorist organization, raising the point that &quot;The material-support statute doesn’t need revision to accommodate non-existent defects. What it does need – and does not often enough get for fear of offending some Muslim organizations – is rigorous enforcement against accurately designated organizations, of which MEK is not one.&quot;

===2015 Blue Ribbon Commission===

In 2015, Ridge served as co-chair of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a commission that recommended changes to U.S. policy regarding biodefense. In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33-step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Tom Ridge headed the organization with former Senator Joe Lieberman, and the Study Panel assembled in Washington, D.C., for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel&#x27;s final report, &quot;The National Blueprint for Biodefense&quot;, proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the vice president authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel&#x27;s call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues.

===2016 presidential election===
In 2016, Ridge endorsed Jeb Bush and subsequently John Kasich after Bush&#x27;s withdrawal from the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. Ridge stated he would not endorse Donald Trump, following Trump becoming the presumptive nominee, or Hillary Clinton in the general election.

===Criticisms of President Trump===

In July 2020, Ridge criticized President Trump for saying in June that vote-by-mail leads to widespread voter fraud, responding that it is not a threat and that voters need a safe way to cast a ballot in the 2020 election, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Ridge also said that it was &quot;sad&quot; that the President wants to quash the legitimacy of the election. In response to Ridge&#x27;s comments, the RNC said lawsuits by Democrats to strip ballot safeguards are an attempt to delegitimize the election. Ridge is a co-chair of VoteSafe, a bipartisan group that promotes safe voting by mail and in person.

Also in July 2020, Ridge slammed his former Department for sending in federal agents to detain rioters allegedly committing federal crimes in Portland, Oregon, after more than 50 days of protests and riots there. He also said, during an interview with radio host Michael Smerconish, that it would be a &quot;cold day in hell&quot; before he &quot;would consent to an uninvited, unilateral intervention&quot; in one of his cities in Pennsylvania. The White House cited federal law to support this use of federal law enforcement. Trump later slammed Ridge on Twitter, calling him &quot;a failed RINO&quot; and saying he &quot;loved watching pathetic Never Trumpers squirm!&quot;.

===2020 presidential election===
In September 2020, Ridge endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for president in a &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; op-ed. On November 6, 2020, he confirmed to CNN that it was the first time he ever voted for a Democratic presidential candidate.

Ridge, along with more than 100 Republican former national security officials, signed a letter in November that stated that the delay of the presidential transition imperiled the security of the nation. The 9/11 Commission finding that the shortened transition to the administration of George W. Bush during the disputed 2000 presidential election &quot;hampered the new administration in identifying, recruiting, clearing, and obtaining Senate confirmation of key appointees&quot; was mentioned in the statement.

In August 2022, Ridge described the January 6 United States Capitol attack as &quot;conduct you’d see in a Third World country, not in the United States of America&quot; and described current politics in America as &quot;distressing&quot;, &quot;personal, vengeful, [and] mean-spirited.&quot;

=== 2022 Senate Election ===
In 2022, Ridge endorsed fellow Republican Mehmet Oz in the 2022 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania.

==Memoir==
Tom Ridge&#x27;s book &quot;The Test of Our Times&quot; was published in September 2009. Written with Larry Bloom, it focuses on Ridge&#x27;s time as the head of the Department of Homeland Security. He explains the challenges and decision-making processes of the newly formed department, and gives his own views as to the future of the security of the United States of America. The book further discusses

Ridge wrote in his memoir that then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and then-Attorney General John Ashcroft pressured him to raise the terror alert level, running up to the 2004 elections, because of a pre-election message critical of President Bush from Osama Bin Laden.

<text>The scapula (: scapulae or scapulas), also known as the shoulder blade, is the bone that connects the humerus (upper arm bone) with the clavicle (collar bone). Like their connected bones, the scapulae are paired, with each scapula on either side of the body being roughly a mirror image of the other. The name derives from the Classical Latin word for trowel or small shovel, which it was thought to resemble.

In compound terms, the prefix omo- is used for the shoulder blade in medical terminology. This prefix is derived from ὦμος (ōmos), the Ancient Greek word for shoulder, and is cognate with the Latin , which in Latin signifies either the shoulder or the upper arm bone.

The scapula forms the back of the shoulder girdle. In humans, it is a flat bone, roughly triangular in shape, placed on a posterolateral aspect of the thoracic cage.

== Structure ==
The scapula is a thick, flat bone lying on the thoracic wall that provides an attachment for three groups of muscles: intrinsic, extrinsic, and stabilizing and rotating muscles. 

The intrinsic muscles of the scapula include the muscles of the rotator cuff(SITS muscle)—the subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor. These muscles attach to the surface of the scapula and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the shoulder joint, along with humeral abduction.

The extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, and spine of the scapula. These muscles are responsible for several actions of the glenohumeral joint.

The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation of the scapula, consists of the trapezius, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles. These attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders of the scapula.

The head, processes, and the thickened parts of the bone contain cancellous tissue; the rest consists of a thin layer of compact tissue.

The central part of the supraspinatus fossa and the upper part of the infraspinatous fossa, but especially the former, are usually so thin in humans as to be semitransparent; occasionally the bone is found wanting in this situation, and the adjacent muscles are separated only by fibrous tissue. The scapula has two surfaces, three borders, three angles, and three processes.

=== Surfaces ===

;Front or subscapular fossa
The front of the scapula (also known as the costal or ventral surface) has a broad concavity called the subscapular fossa, to which the subscapularis muscle attaches. The medial two-thirds of the fossa have 3 longitudinal oblique ridges, and another thick ridge adjoins the lateral border; they run outward and upward. The ridges give attachment to the tendinous insertions, and the surfaces between them to the fleshy fibers, of the subscapularis muscle. The lateral third of the fossa is smooth and covered by the fibers of this muscle.

At the upper part of the fossa is a transverse depression, where the bone appears to be bent on itself along a line at right angles to and passing through the center of the glenoid cavity, forming a considerable angle, called the subscapular angle; this gives greater strength to the body of the bone by its arched form, while the summit of the arch serves to support the spine and acromion.

The costal surface superior of the scapula is the origin of 1st digitation for the serratus anterior origin.


;Back
The back of the scapula (also called the dorsal or posterior surface) is arched from above downward, and is subdivided into two unequal parts by the spine of the scapula. The portion above the spine is called the supraspinous fossa, and that below it the infraspinous fossa. The two fossae are connected by the spinoglenoid notch, situated lateral to the root of the spine.
* The &quot;supraspinous fossa&quot;, above the spine of scapula, is concave, smooth, and broader at its vertebral than at its humeral end; its medial two-thirds give origin to the Supraspinatus. At its lateral surface resides the spinoglenoid fossa which is situated by the medial margin of the glenoid. The spinoglenoid fossa houses the suprascapular canal which forms a connecting passage between the suprascapular notch and the spinoglenoid notch conveying the suprascapular nerve and vessels. 
* The &quot;infraspinous fossa&quot; is much larger than the preceding; toward its vertebral margin a shallow concavity is seen at its upper part; its center presents a prominent convexity, while near the axillary border is a deep groove which runs from the upper toward the lower part. The medial two-thirds of the fossa give origin to the Infraspinatus; the lateral third is covered by this muscle.

There is a ridge on the outer part of the back of the scapula. This runs from the lower part of the glenoid cavity, downward and backward to the vertebral border, about 2.5 cm above the inferior angle. Attached to the ridge is a fibrous septum, which separates the infraspinatus muscle from the Teres major and Teres minor muscles. The upper two-thirds of the surface between the ridge and the axillary border is narrow, and is crossed near its center by a groove for the scapular circumflex vessels; the Teres minor attaches here.

The broad and narrow portions above alluded to are separated by an oblique line, which runs from the axillary border, downward and backward, to meet the elevated ridge: to it is attached a fibrous septum which separates the Teres muscles from each other.

Its lower third presents a broader, somewhat triangular surface, the inferior angle of the scapula, which gives origin to the Teres major, and over which the Latissimus dorsi glides; frequently the latter muscle takes origin by a few fibers from this part.

;Side
The acromion forms the summit of the shoulder, and is a large, somewhat triangular or oblong process, flattened from behind forward, projecting at first laterally, and then curving forward and upward, so as to overhang the glenoid cavity.

=== Angles ===
There are 3 angles:

The superior angle of the scapula or medial angle, is covered by the trapezius muscle. This angle is formed by the junction of the superior and medial borders of the scapula. The superior angle is located at the approximate level of the second thoracic vertebra. The superior angle of the scapula is thin, smooth, rounded, and inclined somewhat lateralward, and gives attachment to a few fibers of the levator scapulae muscle.

The inferior angle of the scapula is the lowest part of the scapula and is covered by the latissimus dorsi muscle. It moves forwards round the chest when the arm is abducted. The inferior angle is formed by the union of the medial and lateral borders of the scapula. It is thick and rough and its posterior or back surface affords attachment to the teres major and often to a few fibers of the latissimus dorsi. The anatomical plane that passes vertically through the inferior angle is named the scapular line.

The lateral angle of the scapula or glenoid angle, also known as the head of the scapula, is the thickest part of the scapula. It is broad and bears the glenoid fossa on its articular surface which is directed forward, laterally and slightly upwards, and articulates with the head of the humerus. The inferior angle is broader below than above and its vertical diameter is the longest. The surface is covered with cartilage in the fresh state; and its margins, slightly raised, give attachment to a fibrocartilaginous structure, the glenoidal labrum, which deepens the cavity. At its apex is a slight elevation, the supraglenoid tuberosity, to which the long head of the biceps brachii is attached.

The anatomic neck of the scapula is the slightly constricted portion which surrounds the head and is more distinct below and behind than above and in front. The surgical neck of the scapula passes directly medial to the base of the coracoid process.

=== Borders ===
There are three borders of the scapula:
* The superior border is the shortest and thinnest; it is concave, and extends from the superior angle to the base of the coracoid process. It is referred to as the cranial border in animals.
::At its lateral part is a deep, semicircular notch, the scapular notch, formed partly by the base of the coracoid process. This notch is converted into a foramen by the superior transverse scapular ligament, and serves for the passage of the suprascapular nerve; sometimes the ligament is ossified.
::The adjacent part of the superior border affords attachment to the omohyoideus.
* The axillary border (or &quot;lateral border&quot;) is the thickest of the three. It begins above at the lower margin of the glenoid cavity, and inclines obliquely downward and backward to the inferior angle. It is referred to as the caudal border in animals.
::It begins above at the lower margin of the glenoid cavity, and inclines obliquely downward and backward to the inferior angle.
::Immediately below the glenoid cavity is a rough impression, the infraglenoid tuberosity, about . in length, which gives origin to the long head of the triceps brachii; in front of this is a longitudinal groove, which extends as far as the lower third of this border, and affords origin to part of the subscapularis.
::The inferior third is thin and sharp, and serves for the attachment of a few fibers of the teres major behind, and of the subscapularis in front.

* The medial border (also called the vertebral border or medial margin) is the longest of the three borders, and extends from the superior angle to the inferior angle. In animals it is referred to as the dorsal border.

::Four muscles attach to the medial border. Serratus anterior has a long attachment on the anterior lip. Three muscles insert along the posterior lip, the levator scapulae (uppermost), rhomboid minor (middle), and to the rhomboid major (lower middle).
=== Development ===
The scapula is ossified from 7 or more centers: one for the body, two for the coracoid process, two for the acromion, one for the vertebral border, and one for the inferior angle. Ossification of the body begins about the second month of fetal life, by an irregular quadrilateral plate of bone forming, immediately behind the glenoid cavity. This plate extends to form the chief part of the bone, the scapular spine growing up from its dorsal surface about the third month. Ossification starts as membranous ossification before birth. After birth, the cartilaginous components would undergo endochondral ossification. The larger part of the scapula undergoes membranous ossification. Some of the outer parts of the scapula are cartilaginous at birth, and would therefore undergo endochondral ossification.

At birth, a large part of the scapula is osseous, but the glenoid cavity, the coracoid process, the acromion, the vertebral border and the inferior angle are cartilaginous. From the 15th to the 18th month after birth, ossification takes place in the middle of the coracoid process, which as a rule becomes joined with the rest of the bone about the 15th year.

Between the 14th and 20th years, the remaining parts ossify in quick succession, and usually in the following order: first, in the root of the coracoid process, in the form of a broad scale; secondly, near the base of the acromion; thirdly, in the inferior angle and contiguous part of the vertebral border; fourthly, near the outer end of the acromion; fifthly, in the vertebral border.
The base of the acromion is formed by an extension from the spine; the two nuclei of the acromion unite, and then join with the extension from the spine. The upper third of the glenoid cavity is ossified from a separate center (sub coracoid), which appears between the 10th and 11th years and joins between the 16th and the 18th years. Further, an epiphysial plate appears for the lower part of the glenoid cavity, and the tip of the coracoid process frequently has a separate nucleus. These various epiphyses are joined to the bone by the 25th year.

Failure of bony union between the acromion and spine sometimes occurs (see os acromiale), the junction being effected by fibrous tissue, or by an imperfect articulation; in some cases of supposed fracture of the acromion with ligamentous union, it is probable that the detached segment was never united to the rest of the bone.

== Function ==
The following muscles attach to the scapula:

=== Movements ===

Movements of the scapula are brought about by the scapular muscles. The scapula can perform six actions:
* Elevation: upper trapezius and levator scapulae
* Depression: lower trapezius
* Retraction (adduction): rhomboids and middle trapezius
* Protraction (abduction): serratus anterior
* Upward rotation: upper and lower trapezius, serratus anterior
* Downward rotation: rhomboids, Levator Scapulae, and Pec Minor

== Clinical significance ==

===Scapular fractures===
Because of its sturdy structure and protected location, fractures of the scapula are uncommon. When they do occur, they are an indication that severe chest trauma has occurred.
Scapular fractures involving the neck of the scapula have two patterns. One (rare) type of fracture is through the anatomical neck of the scapula. The other more common type of fracture is through the surgical neck of the scapula. The surgical neck exits medial to the coracoid process.

An abnormally protruding inferior angle of the scapula is known as a winged scapula and can be caused by paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle. In this condition the sides of the scapula nearest the spine are positioned outward and backward. The appearance of the upper back is said to be wing-like. In addition, any condition causing weakness of the serratus anterior muscle may cause scapular &quot;winging&quot;.

=== Scapular dyskenesis ===

The scapula plays an important role in shoulder impingement syndrome.

Abnormal scapular function is called scapular dyskinesis. The scapula performs elevation of the acromion process during a throwing or serving motion, in order to avoid impingement of the rotator cuff tendons. If the scapula fails to properly elevate the acromion, impingement may occur during the cocking and acceleration phase of an overhead activity. The two muscles most commonly inhibited during this first part of an overhead motion are the serratus anterior and the lower trapezius. These two muscles act as a force couple within the glenohumeral joint to properly elevate the acromion process, and if a muscle imbalance exists, shoulder impingement may develop.

Other conditions associated with scapular dyskenesis include thoracic outlet syndrome and the related pectoralis minor syndrome.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;scapula&quot; as synonym of &quot;shoulder blade&quot; is of Latin origin. It is commonly used in medical English and is part of the current official Latin nomenclature, &quot;Terminologia Anatomica&quot;. Shoulder blade is the colloquial name for this bone.

== In other animals ==

In fish, the scapular blade is a structure attached to the upper surface of the articulation of the pectoral fin, and is accompanied by a similar coracoid plate on the lower surface. Although sturdy in cartilagenous fish, both plates are generally small in most other fish, and may be partially cartilagenous, or consist of multiple bony elements.

In the early tetrapods, these two structures respectively became the scapula and a bone referred to as the procoracoid (commonly called simply the &quot;coracoid&quot;, but not homologous with the mammalian structure of that name). In amphibians and reptiles (birds included), these two bones are distinct, but together form a single structure bearing many of the muscle attachments for the forelimb. In such animals, the scapula is usually a relatively simple plate, lacking the projections and spine that it possesses in mammals. However, the detailed structure of these bones varies considerably in living groups. For example, in frogs, the procoracoid bones may be braced together at the animal&#x27;s underside to absorb the shock of landing, while in turtles, the combined structure forms a Y-shape in order to allow the scapula to retain a connection to the clavicle (which is part of the shell). In birds, the procoracoids help to brace the wing against the top of the sternum.

In the fossil therapsids, a third bone, the true coracoid, formed just behind the procoracoid. The resulting three-boned structure is still seen in modern monotremes, but in all other living mammals, the procoracoid has disappeared, and the coracoid bone has fused with the scapula, to become the coracoid process. These changes are associated with the upright gait of mammals, compared with the more sprawling limb arrangement of reptiles and amphibians; the muscles formerly attached to the procoracoid are no longer required. The altered musculature is also responsible for the alteration in the shape of the rest of the scapula; the forward margin of the original bone became the spine and acromion, from which the main shelf of the shoulder blade arises as a new structure.

=== In dinosaurs ===

In dinosaurs the main bones of the pectoral girdle were the scapula (shoulder blade) and the coracoid, both of which directly articulated with the clavicle. The clavicle was present in saurischian dinosaurs but largely absent in ornithischian dinosaurs. The place on the scapula where it articulated with the humerus (upper bone of the forelimb) is called the glenoid. The scapula serves as the attachment site for a dinosaur&#x27;s back and forelimb muscles.

<text>Anneli Tuulikki Jäätteenmäki (born 11 February 1955) is a Finnish politician who was the first female and 39th prime minister of Finland from 17 April 2003 to 24 June 2003. From 2004 until 2019, she served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from Finland.

==Background and career==

Jäätteenmäki was born on a small farm in the forests of Ostrobothnia in Finland. Her brother was to take over the farm, so the daughters of the family went to school. Jäätteenmäki became a member of the Centre Party and was active in student politics. She earned a master&#x27;s degree in law in 1980 and worked as a lawyer for the party&#x27;s parliamentary group from 1981 until 1987, when she was elected to the Finnish Parliament (Eduskunta). Jäätteenmäki was Minister of Justice from 1994 to 1995, then her party became part of the opposition. She was elected as chairwoman of the Centre Party of Finland from 18 June 2000 to 5 October 2003, although the first year was as acting leader during Esko Aho&#x27;s sabbatical leave to lecture at Harvard University.

==Prime minister==

After eight years in opposition, she led the Centre Party of Finland to a narrow victory over the formerly largest party, the Social Democratic Party of Finland, in the parliamentary elections of 2003. According to the new constitution, which was in effect for the first time after this election, she was thereby given the first opportunity to form a new Cabinet. After successful coalition negotiations with the Social Democrats and the Swedish People&#x27;s Party, she came to head a coalition cabinet which chiefly continued on the lines of its predecessor, Paavo Lipponen&#x27;s second Cabinet, but introduced new measures to stimulate the economy, including tax cuts.

During her brief time in office, Finland was the only country in the world to have women as both prime minister and president, a situation underlined by the fact that half her cabinet were women; but at the same time there was another country, New Zealand, whose head of state Queen Elizabeth II (in office 1952-2022), her New Zealand representative Governor-General Silvia Cartwright (in office 2001-6), Prime Minister Helen Clark (in office 1999–2008) and Chief Justice Sian Elias (in office 1999–2019) were all female. (Anneli Jäätteenmäki&#x27;s short term as Prime Minister of Finland is, however, not the shortest in the history of Finland. Beside caretaker cabinets and temporary prime ministers appointed due to the death or disease of the predecessor, Juho Heikki Vennola headed a Cabinet which lasted only for a little more than a month February–March 1931, in connection with the Lapua Movement&#x27;s vociferous anti-democratic demands for influence on the presidential election.)

== Resignation ==

Anneli Jäätteenmäki resigned on 18 June 2003, under pressure resulting from the accusation that she had lied to Parliament and the public over how she had acquired confidential Foreign Ministry documents which she used for political purposes during the election campaign. The documents contained diplomatic information from a meeting between United States President George W. Bush and Finland&#x27;s prime minister Paavo Lipponen about Finland&#x27;s position regarding the U.S.&#x27;s Iraq war. Jäätteenmäki used the information to suggest that her rival, the Social Democrat leader Paavo Lipponen, had secretly offered Finnish support for the U.S.-led coalition, a substantial breach of the official policy of neutrality in Finland&#x27;s foreign politics, and thus associated Finland with what many Finns considered an illegal war of aggression. Jäätteenmäki broke the traditional unity and silence behind Finland&#x27;s security policies. As the elections turned out to be close, the defeated Social Democrats found reasons to suspect that her nontraditional campaign tactic was decisive in determining the outcome, which soured the relationship between the two major coalition partners.

After the leaked documents were published in several newspapers in March, the police launched a criminal investigation based on the Official Secrets Act. On 11 June Prime Minister Jäätteenmäki was heard as a witness by the police, which led to increasing pressure on her to come clean on her role in the leak. The same week, the incriminating minutes of a meeting of Centre Party leaders were leaked to the press, as later came clear, via the Centre Party second vice-chairman Hannu Takkula. On 16 June it came to light that a presidential aide, Martti Manninen, affiliated with the Centre Party, had leaked the foreign ministry documents. On 18 June Jäätteenmäki gave her &quot;full explanation&quot; to Parliament and apologised to the President, claiming that she had been faxed the documents without asking for them, and that she had not known of their secrecy. The Parliament was not satisfied with her account, and once Manninen (the same afternoon) publicly claimed that Jäätteenmäki had specifically and forcefully asked for the information, and that he would be able to prove it, her coalition partners made it clear that they had no trust in her leadership. She resigned the same evening, citing the lack of political trust, and without admitting any wrongdoing.

Consequently, she announced on 24 June that she would resign as leader of the Centre Party. Matti Vanhanen was elected as the new party leader on 5 October, and he succeeded her as prime minister.

The police investigation into the leak concluded, on 19 December 2003, that Jäätteenmäki should be prosecuted for aiding or abetting Manninen in revealing state secrets in contravention of the law. However, on 19 March 2004, the Helsinki District Court acquitted Jäätteenmäki on all counts.

== Member of European Parliament ==
Jäätteenmäki served as an MEP for the Centre Party in the European Parliament. In the 2004 European Parliament elections, she received over 140,000 votes, the highest individual tally and approximately 8% of all votes cast.

In April 2006, Jäätteenmäki announced to the Finnish media that she was going to take some time out of her parliamentary work due to breast cancer, but she returned to politics following her successful recovery. Despite offers to return to Finnish national politics, she declined to become a candidate in the Finnish Parliament elections in 2007. She was reelected to the European Parliament in the 2009 European Parliament elections with the second highest tally of votes in Finland after Timo Soini.

She was reelected to the European Parliament for a third time and final term in 2014.

<doc id="211393" wikidata="Q181902" url="?curid=211393" title="Treaty of Trianon">
<text>The Treaty of Trianon (; ; ; ) often referred to as the Peace Dictate of Trianon or Dictate of Trianon in Hungary, was prepared at the Paris Peace Conference and was signed on the one side by Hungary and, on the other, by the Allied and Associated Powers, in the Grand Trianon château in Versailles on 4 June 1920. It formally terminated the state of war issued from World War I between most of the Allies of World War I and the Kingdom of Hungary. The treaty is mostly famous due to the territorial changes induced on Hungary and recognizing its new international borders after the First World War. 

Hungary, as part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, had been involved in the First World War since August 1914. After its allies – Bulgaria and later Turkey – signed armistices with the Entente, the political elite in Budapest opted to end the war as well. On 31 October 1918, the Budapest government declared independence of Hungary from Austria and immediately began peace talks with the Allies. Despite the end of hostilities, the Entente Allies – Hungary&#x27;s neighbours – Czechoslovakia (which just declared its independence on 28 October 1918), Romania, and Yugoslavia put Hungary under an economic blockade. They deprived Hungary of importing food, fuel (coal and petrol) and other important goods. In an attempt to alleviate the economic crisis, succeeding Hungarian governments pleaded with the Entente to lift the blockade and restore regional trade. First peace talks led to an armistice in Belgrade on 13 November 1918: Hungary undertook to demobilise its army and granted the Allies the right to occupy the south (Vojvodina and Croatia) and east of Hungary (south Transylvania) until a peace treaty was signed. In December 1918, Budapest allowed the Czechoslovak troops to occupy northern Hungary (Slovakia) as well. In exchange, Budapest hoped to reopen foreign trade and supply coal.

In order to extend their zones of occupation in Hungary, Romania and Czechoslovakia moved their armies further into Hungary in April 1919, provoking a renewal of hostilities between these three countries. In June 1919, the Entente powers ordered Budapest, Prague, and Bucharest to cease fighting and accept new demarcation lines that would be guaranteed as the future borders of Hungary. Despite temporary military successes against the Czechs, Budapest accepted the offer and withdrew its army behind the demarcation line. Bucharest, however, ignored the Entente order and continued its offensive.  In early August 1919, the Romanian army entered Budapest and a new pro-Romanian government was installed in Hungary. This marked the end of hostilities between the Hungarians and the Romanians. 

However, the Entente pressed the Romanians to leave Budapest in November 1919 and orchestrated formation of a new Hungarian coalition government. The new cabinet was invited to attend the Paris Peace Conference. In January 1920, it received the Allied proposal for a peace treaty. The treaty stipulated the legalization of the demarcation lines of 13 June 1919 as the new borders and guaranteed the end of the blockade and the restoration of free trade between the former Habsburg lands and the import of coal into Hungary. The government in Budapest and the Hungarian Parliament (opened in February 1920) accepted the peace terms. While it welcomed the restoration of peace and trade, it still formally protested against the cession of their former territories without plebiscites. The Peace Treaty was signed on 4 June 1920, ratified by Hungary on 16 November 1920 and came into force on 26 July 1921.

The post-1920 Hungary became a landlocked state that included , 28% of the that had constituted the pre-war Kingdom of Hungary (the Hungarian half of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy). The kingdom had a population of 7.6 million, 36% compared to the pre-war kingdom&#x27;s population of 20.9 million. Though the areas that were allocated to neighbouring countries had a majority of non-Hungarians, in them lived 3.3 million Hungarians – 31% of the Hungarians – who then became minorities. The treaty limited Hungary&#x27;s army to 35,000 officers and men, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy ceased to exist. These decisions and their consequences have been the cause of deep resentment in Hungary ever since.

The principal beneficiaries were the Kingdom of Romania, the Czechoslovak Republic, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and the First Austrian Republic. But it also led to international recognition of Hungary and of its sovereignty. The treaty canceled the Belgrade armistice, which gave right to the Allied powers to occupy Hungary. The treaty also granted Hungarian citizens abroad right of protection of their property from nationalization. Most importantly, it guaranteed the free trade between Hungary, Austria, and Czechoslovakia (for 5 years), and obliged Czechoslovakia and Poland to supply coal to Hungary in &quot;reasonable quantity&quot;. One of the main elements of the treaty was the doctrine of &quot;self-determination of peoples&quot;, and it was an attempt to give the non-Hungarians their own national states. In addition, Hungary had to pay war reparations to its neighbours. 

The treaty was dictated by the Allies rather than negotiated, and the Hungarians faced an option to accept or reject its terms in full. The Hungarian delegation signed the treaty under protest, and agitation for its revision began immediately. The current boundaries of Hungary are for the most part the same as those defined by the Treaty of Trianon. Minor modifications occurred in 1921-1924 on the Hungarian-Austrian border and the transfer of three villages to Czechoslovakia in 1947. However, the actual borders of Hungary stem out from the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947, which cancelled the territorial aggrandizement of Hungary in 1938–1941. The Paris treaty of 1947 de-facto restored the Trianon borders of Hungary.

After World War I, despite the &quot;self-determination of peoples&quot; idea of the US President Wilson, the Allies refused to organise plebiscites in Hungary to draw its new borders. The Allies explained this decision in a cover letter, which accompanied the text of the Peace Treaty with Hungary. The letter, signed by the President of the Paris Peace Conference, Alexander Millerand, dated 6 May 1920, stated that the Entente Powers and their allies determined new borders of Hungary without plebiscites due to their belief that &quot;a popular consultation ... would not produce significantly different results&quot;. At the same time, the letter suggested that the Council of the League of Nations might offer its mediation to rectify the new borders amicably if suggested by the delimitation commission. The Hungarian diplomacy later appealed to the Millerand letter as a Great Powers promise of future territorial revisions in favour of Hungary. 

Only one plebiscite was permitted (later known as the Sopron plebiscite) to settle disputed borders on the former territory of the Kingdom of Hungary, settling a smaller territorial dispute between the First Austrian Republic and the Kingdom of Hungary, because some months earlier, the Rongyos Gárda launched a series of attacks to oust the Austrian forces that entered the area. During the Sopron plebiscite in late 1921, the polling stations were supervised by British, French, and Italian army officers of the Allied Powers.

== Background ==
=== First World War and Austro-Hungarian Armistice ===
On 28 June 1914, the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, was assassinated by a Serbian nationalist. This caused a rapidly escalating July Crisis resulting in Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia, followed quickly by the entry of most European powers into the First World War. Two alliances faced off, the Central Powers (led by Germany) and the Triple Entente (led by Britain, France and Russia). In 1918 Germany tried to overwhelm the Allies on the Western Front but failed. Instead the Allies began a successful counteroffensive and forced the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that resembled a surrender by the Central Powers.

On 6 April 1917, the United States entered the war against Germany and in December 1917 against Austria-Hungary. The American war aim was to end aggressive militarism as shown by Berlin and Vienna; the United States never formally joined the Allies. President Woodrow Wilson acted as an independent force, and his Fourteen Points was accepted by Germany as a basis for the armistice of November 1918. It outlined a policy of free trade, open agreements, and democracy. While the term was not used, self-determination was assumed. It called for a negotiated end to the war, international disarmament, the withdrawal of the Central Powers from occupied territories, the creation of a Polish state, the redrawing of Europe&#x27;s borders along ethnic lines, and the formation of a League of Nations to guarantee the political independence and territorial integrity of all states. It called for a just and democratic peace uncompromised by territorial annexation. Point ten announced Wilson&#x27;s &quot;wish&quot; that the peoples of Austria-Hungary be given autonomy—a point that Vienna rejected.

The Hungarian Parliament, led by Prime Minister Sándor Wekerle, agreed to the proposal to discuss peace on the basis of Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points. At the same time, it declared that the problem of non-Hungarian nations in Hungary was an internal matter for the state. Wekerle refused to publicly admit that the war was lost. Responding to that, Count Mihály Károlyi said that &quot;We have lost the war. Now the main thing is not to lose the peace&quot; and called for a democratic Hungary to conclude the most advantageous peace with the Entente. Count István Tisza responded that although Károlyi was right that the war was lost, Hungary did not need further democratisation during wartime. The only important task was to preserve the territorial integrity of Hungary, which Tisza claimed did not go against Wilson&#x27;s points. (Tisza was bitterly unpopular among ethnic Hungarian voters and therefore his party National Party of Work drew most of his votes from ethnic minorities during the parliamentary elections.) The non-Hungarian ethnic groups of Hungary would receive only small concession. The sole Slovak member of the parliament, , opened his speech by denying the right of the Hungarian parliament to speak or act in the name of the Slovaks, declared that only the Slovak National Council had the right to represent Slovaks at the peace conference and demanded the right to self-determination for all nations of Hungary. The Hungarian parliament erupted in anger, shouting &quot;Where is this council!? Where is the Slovak nation!? What county does it live in!? Who is this really!? Stop him speaking!!&quot;

On 18 October Woodrow Wilson responded to the peace offer of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, burying the hope that federalization would preserve its territorial integrity. Wilson emphasized that since his Fourteen Points on 8 January the situation has changed, that the USA has recognized the Czechoslovak National Council in Paris as a de facto government, and that the &quot;&quot;oppressed nations of Austria-Hungary will themselves assess what will satisfy their aspirations and their rights&quot;.&quot;. In his last political speech to the Hungarian parliament, Tisza bitterly complained about how the Entente powers &quot;negotiated with the internal enemies of the state&quot; which meant that now he was forced to enter talks with &quot;the phantasmagoria of a Czechoslovak state&quot;. Wekerle responded that they will negotiate with them &quot;only if they first give up on the idea of turning Hungary into Eastern Switzerland&quot;. Wekerle promised the parliament that they will tell Wilson that &quot;we know of no Czechoslovak union, only of a Czech union&quot;. The Hungarian government agreed to begin negotiations with the nationalities, promise them some minor concessions and if these were not accepted, they would hold a plebiscite and make sure its resolution was favorable to Hungarians and the integrity of Hungary. They would inform President Wilson of the results and the conditions for peace would be fulfilled. Only a minority of Hungarian politicians, led by Mihály Károlyi, sought preservation in the democratisation of the semi-feudal kingdom, which still lacked universal suffrage. (Similar to Hungary, the most Western European countries did not have universal suffrage before the end of WW1. The UK introduced universal suffrage after WWI Representation of the People Act 1918). All feudal privileges of the Hungarian nobility was erased by the April Laws of 1848.

Germany, the major ally of Austria-Hungary in World War I, suffered numerous losses during the Hundred Days Offensive between August and November 1918 and was in negotiation of armistice with Allied Powers from the beginning of October 1918. Between 15 and 29 September 1918, Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey, in command of a relative small army of Greeks (9 divisions), French (6 divisions), Serbs (6 divisions), British (4 divisions) and Italians (1 division), staged a successful Vardar offensive in Vardar Macedonia that ended by taking Bulgaria out of the war. That collapse of the Southern (Italian) Front was one of several developments that effectively triggered the November 1918 armistice. By the end of October 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Army was so fatigued that its commanders were forced to seek a ceasefire. Czechoslovakia and the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs were proclaimed, and troops started deserting, disobeying orders and retreating. Many Czechoslovak troops, in fact, started working for the Allied cause, and in September 1918, five Czechoslovak Regiments were formed in the Italian Army. The launch of an offensive by 51 Entente divisions along the whole Italian front on 24 October 1918 lead to the destruction of the Austro-Hungarian army. The troops of Austria-Hungary started a chaotic withdrawal during the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, and Austria-Hungary began to negotiate a truce on 28 October, which they signed at Padua on 3 November 1918.

The Hungarian Parliament dissolved on 23 October after learning of a revolution in Rijeka, Croatia, where the 79th Infantry regiment rebelled and occupied the town. Fearing the spread of revolution from Croatia to Hungary, Prime Minister Wekerle resigned under pressure.

=== Aster Revolution and the First Hungarian Republic ===
During the war, Count Mihály Károlyi led a small but very active pacifist anti-war maverick faction in the Hungarian parliament. He even organized covert contacts with British and French diplomats in Switzerland. On 25 October 1918 Károlyi had formed the Hungarian National Council. The Austro-Hungarian monarchy politically collapsed and disintegrated as a result of a defeat in the Italian front. On 31 October 1918, in the midst of armistice negotiations, the Aster Revolution erupted and Charles IV King of Hungary appointed the liberal Károlyi as prime minister. The revolution in Budapest occurred in parallel to the disintegration of the Austria-Hungary trade network. The heaviest blow to the government was caused by the stop of coal imports from Silesia, which assured the functioning of most of transport, industry and heating in cities. By 5 November, Károlyi learnt that the national coal stocks would be empty in 2 days. The energy crisis in Hungary, caused by a shortage of coal, weakened the Budapest government to such an extent that it felt compelled to seek a compromise with Czechoslovakia, which was blocking the coal road to Silesia.‘Each Wagon of Coal Should Be Paid for with Territorial concessions.’ Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and the Coal Shortage in 1918–21

The collapse of the Austro-Hungarian army on the Italian front also affected the rear units in Hungary. By the beginning of November 1918, the collapsing statehood was experiencing &quot;disturbances&quot; or &quot;looting&quot;. On the 1st of November, the pacifist and pro-Entente Károlyi&#x27;s new Hungarian government decided to recall all of the troops, who were conscripted from the territory of Kingdom of Hungary, which was a major blow for the Habsburg&#x27;s armies. Károlyi&#x27;s new government insisted on preserving the historic borders of Hungary, but it was in no position to comply with the urgent demands for forcible intervention, demanded by military commanders. Károlyi intended to conclude an armistice independently in the name of Hungary, without regard for its German and Austrian allies. By this, alongside his pacifist views, he sought to distance Hungary from those mainly responsible for the war, and convince the victorious Entente that his government already represented a democratic country, and so should not be punished for the warlike actions of preceding governments, as Slovak historian Marián Hronský considered.

===Unilaterial self-disarmament of the Hungarian army ===
Károlyi yielded to President Wilson&#x27;s demand for pacifism by ordering the unilateral self-disarmament of the Hungarian army.The Hungarian Royal Honvéd army still had more than 1,400,000 soldiers, when Károlyi was announced as prime minister. This happened under the direction of Minister of War Béla Linder on 2 November 1918 On the request of the Austro-Hungarian government, an armistice was granted to Austria-Hungary on 3 November 1918 by the Allies. Disarmament of its army meant that Hungary was to remain without a national defence at a time of particular vulnerability. The unilateral self-disarmament made the occupation of Hungary directly possible for the relatively small armies of Romania, the Franco-Serbian army, and the armed forces of the newly established Czechoslovakia. Nevertheless, small Hungarian troops were still able to resist the advancement of the Czech army in the North. Only in early December the Budapest government ordered their withdrawal following a political arrangement with Prague which established the first demarcation line between Hungary and Czechoslovakia.

===International reactions to the Hungarian disarmament===
Military and political events changed rapidly and drastically after the Hungarian unilateral disarmament:
* On 5 November 1918, the Serbian army, with the help of the French army, crossed the southern borders.
* On 7 November, Hungarian Prime Minister Mihály Károlyi meets General Louis Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey in Belgrade. d&#x27;Espèrey bluntly informed Károlyi that the Hungarian government &quot;Only represents the Magyar people, and not the other nations of Hungary&quot;. When the Hungarian side declared the acceptance of an &quot;Independent Czech and Yugoslav states&quot;, the French general responded &quot;Let us say Czechoslovak&quot;.
* On 8 November, the Czechoslovak army crossed the northern borders.
* On 10 November d&#x27;Espérey&#x27;s army crossed the Danube River and was poised to enter the Hungarian heartland.
* On 11 November Germany signed an armistice with Allies, under which they had to immediately withdraw all German troops in Romania and in the Ottoman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Russian Empire back to German territory and Allies to have access to these countries.
* On 13 November, the Romanian army crossed the eastern borders of the Kingdom of Hungary.

Károlyi appointed the liberal progressive and pacifist Oszkár Jászi to become Minister without portfolio for nationality questions. Jászi wanted to indicate that the old Hungarian policy towards non-Hungarian nations and nationalities was over and a new democratic course was to begin. According to Jászi, the main aim of his nationality policy was &quot;to defend the plebiscite principle, and so where possible make conditions more favorable for Hungary.&quot; The ultimate goal was the creation of a confederative state system, called Danube Confederation, that would preserve the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Hungary. Jászi immediately offered democratic referendums about the disputed borders for minorities; however, the political leaders of those minorities refused the very idea of democratic referendums regarding disputed territories at the Paris peace conference. In spite of this, Hungarian government still possessed forces strong enough to resist the encroaching Entente troops, and on 13 November declared the mobilization of the five youngest year groups (1896–1900). This was presaged by Károlyi&#x27;s proclamation, in which he declared the entrance of Czechoslovak troops a &quot;Czech invasion and occupation&quot;.

The Armistice of 3 November was completed as regards Hungary on 13 November, when Károlyi signed the Armistice of Belgrade with the Allied nations, in order that a Treaty of Peace might be concluded. The terms of the armistice were harsh and without compromise. The Hungarian government had to withdraw its troops behind a line deep into Hungary. The army had to disarm, except for its six infantry and two cavalry divisions. Demarcation lines defining the territory to remain under Hungarian control were made. The lines would apply until definitive borders could be established. The Entente was allowed to occupy strategically important places and its forces were allowed free movement inside Hungary. Under the terms of the armistice, Serbian and French troops advanced from the south, taking control of the Banat and Croatia. Romanian forces were permitted to advance to the River Mureș (Maros). However, on 14 November, Serbia occupied Pécs. General Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey followed up the victory by overrunning much of the Balkans, and by the war&#x27;s end his troops had penetrated well into Hungary. In mid-November 1918, the Czechoslovak troops advanced into the northern parts of the collapsing kingdom (i.e. future Slovakia), but on 14 November Károlyi ordered the Hungarian forces to repulse the &quot;Czech invasion&quot; back. After King Charles IV&#x27;s withdrawal from government on 16 November 1918, Károlyi proclaimed the First Hungarian Republic, with himself as provisional president of the republic. On the same day the Slovak National Council dispatched Pavel Fábry to Budapest on an official mission to discuss public security and police order in their respective areas. Fábry reported back that the Károlyi government considered the fight against Yugoslavs and Romanians to be lost, and instead aimed to send all of their military forces to the northern front, in order to at least retain &quot;Upper Hungary&quot;. Fábry entered talks with Károlyi and Jászi, agreeing to nothing while stalling for time, until the Entente could act. On 6 December, following a note from 3 December sent to Budapest by French Marshal Ferdinand Foch, the Hungarian government agreed to retreat behind temporary boundaries drawn by Milan Hodža, who led a delegation of the Slovak National Council in Budapest. Hodža stipulated that the line he drew &quot;would be valid only until new instructions concerning the demarcation line come from Paris.&quot; On 24 December 1918, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs Stephen Pichon informed Budapest of a new demarcation line, and the Hungarian government agreed to extend the Czechoslovak zone of occupation to Pozsony (Bratislava), Komárom (Komárno), Kassa (Košice) and Ungvár (Užhhorod). By late January 1919, the Czechoslovak troops advanced into these areas. The Budapest approval for the Czechoslovak advancement was largely explained by the Hungarian desire to reopen trade with Czech lands and to obtain crucially needed coal amidst an energy crisis. As a result, by 4 February 1919, the Czechoslovak Ministry moved its headquarters from Zsolna (Žilina) to newly renamed Bratislava (formerly Pozsony). During the rule of Károlyi&#x27;s pacifist cabinet, Hungary rapidly lost control over approximately 75% of its former pre-WWI territories () without a fight and was subject to foreign occupation.

=== Fall of the liberal First Hungarian Republic and communist coup d&#x27;état ===
The Károlyi government failed to manage both domestic and military issues and lost popular support. On 20 March 1919, Béla Kun, who had been imprisoned in the Markó Street prison, was released. On 21 March, he led a successful communist coup d&#x27;état; Károlyi was deposed and arrested. Kun formed a social democratic, communist coalition government and proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Days later the communists purged the social democrats from the government. The Hungarian Soviet Republic was a small communist rump state. When the Republic of Councils in Hungary was established, it controlled only approximately 23% of Hungary&#x27;s historic territory. After the Communist takeover, the Allies sent a new diplomatic mission to Budapest, led by General Jan Smuts. During these talks with Smuts, Kun insisted that his government would abide by the Belgrade ceasefire and recognise the right to self-determination of the various ethnic groups living in Hungary. In return, Kun urged an end to the Allied trade blockade, particularly by the Czechs, and to allow fuel and food to be imported into Hungary.

The communists remained bitterly unpopular in the Hungarian countryside, where the authority of that government was often nonexistent. Rather than divide the big estates among the peasants – which might have gained their support for the government, but would have created a class of small-holding farmers the communist government proclaimed the nationalization of the estates. But having no skilled people to manage the estates, the communists had no choice but to leave the existing estate managers in place. These, while formally accepting their new government bosses, in practice retained their loyalty to the deposed aristocratic owners. The peasants felt that the revolution had no real effect on their lives and thus had no reason to support it. The communist party and communist policies only had real popular support among the proletarian masses of large industrial centers—especially in Budapest—where the working class represented a high proportion of the inhabitants. The communist government followed the Soviet model: the party established its terror groups (like the infamous Lenin Boys) to &quot;overcome the obstacles&quot; in the Hungarian countryside. This was later known as the Red Terror in Hungary.

In late May, after the Entente military representative demanded more territorial concessions from Hungary, Kun attempted to &quot;fulfill&quot; his promise to adhere to Hungary&#x27;s historical borders. The men of the Hungarian Red Army were recruited mainly from the volunteers of the Budapest proletariat. On 20 May 1919, a force under Colonel Aurél Stromfeld attacked and routed Czechoslovak troops from Miskolc. The Romanian Army attacked the Hungarian flank with troops from the 16th Infantry Division and the Second Vânători Division, aiming to maintain contact with the Czechoslovak Army. Hungarian troops prevailed, and the Romanian Army retreated to its bridgehead at Tokaj. There, between 25 and 30 May, Romanian forces were required to defend their position against Hungarian attacks. On 3 June, Romania was forced into further retreat but extended its line of defence along the Tisza River and reinforced its position with the 8th Division, which had been moving forward from Bukovina since 22 May. Hungary then controlled the territory almost to its old borders; regained control of industrial areas around Miskolc, Salgótarján, Selmecbánya (Banská Štiavnica), Kassa (Košice).

In June, the Hungarian Red Army invaded the eastern part of the so-called Upper Hungary, now claimed by the newly forming Czechoslovak state. The Hungarian Red Army achieved some military success early on: under the leadership of Colonel Aurél Stromfeld, it ousted Czechoslovak troops from the north and planned to march against the Romanian Army in the east. Kun ordered the preparation of an offensive against Czechoslovakia, which would increase his domestic support by making good on his promise to restore Hungary&#x27;s borders. The Hungarian Red Army recruited men between 19 and 25 years of age. Industrial workers from Budapest volunteered. Many former Austro-Hungarian officers re-enlisted for patriotic reasons. The Hungarian Red Army moved its 1st and 5th artillery divisions—40 battalions—to Upper Hungary.

Despite promises for the restoration of the former borders of Hungary, the communists declared the establishment of the Slovak Soviet Republic in Prešov (Eperjes) on 16 June 1919. After the proclamation of the Slovak Soviet Republic, the Hungarian nationalists and patriots soon realized that the new communist government had no intentions to recapture the lost territories, only to spread communist ideology and establish other communist states in Europe, thus sacrificing Hungarian national interests. The Hungarian patriots and professional military officers in the Red Army saw the establishment of the Slovak Soviet Republic as a betrayal, and their support for the government began to erode. Despite a series of military victories against the Czechoslovak army, the Hungarian Red Army started to disintegrate due to tension between nationalists and communists during the establishment of the Slovak Soviet Republic. The concession eroded support of the communist government among professional military officers and nationalists in the Hungarian Red Army; even the chief of the general staff Aurél Stromfeld, resigned his post in protest.

When the French promised the Hungarian government that Romanian forces would withdraw from the Tiszántúl, Kun withdrew from Czechoslovakia his remaining military units who had remained loyal after the political fiasco with the Slovak Soviet Republic. Kun then unsuccessfully tried to turn the remaining units of the demoralized Hungarian Red Army on the Romanians.

=== Treaty preparation and Conference at Trianon in Paris ===

After the fall of the communist regime of Béla Kun, the instability of the Hungarian state delayed the sending of a Hungarian delegation to the Peace conference in Paris. On 16 November 1919, Admiral Miklós Horthy entered Budapest, taking over the running of the country for a long time and thus bringing to an end the period of unstable Hungarian governments. By December 1919, text of the proposed Peace Treaty with Hungary was fully prepared in Paris. Thereafter, the Károly Huszár government, which received the international recognition of the Entente, was invited to participate in the Paris Peace Conference on 2 December. The notable pre-WW1 politician and diplomat Count Albert Apponyi was appointed to lead the Hungarian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference to represent the Hungarian interests. Simultaneously, Horthy entrusted Count Pál Teleki with collecting and preparing all the material necessary for the peace conference. Nevertheless it was Apponyi who took over the conceptual leadership of all the works connected with the peace talk. The Czechoslovak President Tomáš Masaryk, knowing that the Hungarian delegation to Paris would be eventually headed by Apponyi, proposed to compile statistics on Hungarian education, where it would be emphasized that it was precisely Apponyi, who in his role as Minister for Education, suppressed the education of minorities in their native languages. The Czechoslovak delegation would be headed by the Slovak ambassador Štefan Osuský, who was given the task to monitor and study Hungarian counter-proposals.

The result of the common work of Apponyi and Teleki was the so-called &quot;Memoirs&quot;: a huge amount of written material containing 346 memoirs supplemented with 4000 pages of large office format with 100 maps and many other statistical and graphical supplements. Copies of the basic set of &quot;Memoirs&quot; were sent to Paris in January 1920, and further supplements, protest notes and demands were added in the following months. The &quot;Memoir&quot; intended to present a harmonious life of the nations and nationalities inside the Kingdom of Hungary while denying their oppression, marginalization and systematic assimilation. But its massive size also turned to be its greatest weakness, as it made it easy for the Paris peace commission to point out any contradiction. Apponyi&#x27;s claims on the question of education were likewise pointed out to be contradictory to what he claimed and what he passed while in office as Minister of Education (1906–1910), which the Czechoslovak side exploited with great effect. The lack of unity and contradictions of the Hungarian Memoirs was because they failed to consistently pursue a single fact. Instead, they argued in favor of four different positions:

* The complete integrity and indivisibility of the historic Kingdom of Hungary, without a plebiscite
* A plebiscite on the territories separated from Hungary
* Adjustments of the borders in favor of Hungary without a plebiscite
* Cultural, economical, transportation and ecclesiastical concessions in the separated territories

The Hungarian representatives placed the blame for the Great War on the former Austrian government. The war was directed centrally from Vienna and Hungarians took no responsibility for its origin or continuation. Hungarians committed no sin other than fighting bravely in the war that was forced on them. Hungarian representatives also claimed credit for ending the war, when they laid down arms after Wilson promulgated his Fourteen Points, only to be rewarded with occupation and robbery of its territory by the Entente. The Bolshevik revolution in Hungary was also blamed on the Entente. The French representatives countered that the Hungarian parliament was in a political alliance with the Prussians since 1867 and continuously supported German imperialism. Apponyi was reminded of how he himself notoriously welcomed the proclamation of the war against Serbia by shouting &quot;Hát végre!&quot; &quot;(&quot;At last!&quot;)&quot; at the Hungarian Parliament in 1914, and how he proceeded to make territorial demands against Serbia. The Hungarian delegation claimed that a diminished Hungary would not be capable of independent economic life and would only be a burden to the Entente. What&#x27;s worse, all the lost natural wealth and energy would be in the hands of &quot;less cultured nations&quot;, unable to use it. The alleged cultural inferiority of Romanians, Slovaks and Yugoslavs would not only lead to economic decline, but would also have a destructive effect on spiritual and moral life, on science, arts, literature, religion (especially European Catholicism), social development and political organization. This is why these nations did not deserve self-realization and should remain under the leadership of Hungarians &quot;who represented a highly developed and state-forming element in the Carpathian basin&quot;. This racially colored mentality of a &quot;ruling nation&quot; was used thorough the &quot;Memoirs&quot; submitted by the Hungarian representatives, and was also used to justify Magyarization. All the non-Hungarian nations and nationalities (with the exception of the Germans and Saxons) had &quot;a much less developed civilization than the Hungarians&quot;, which the Hungarian state blamed on their inferior languages. The Slovaks, Romanians and Jews &quot;willingly&quot; magyarized themselves, because they realized that &quot;the Magyar race was the bearer of a thousand years of civilization&quot;. 

Before World War I, only three European countries declared ethnic minority rights, and enacted minority-protecting laws: the first was Hungary (1849 and 1868), the second was Austria (1867), and the third was Belgium (1898). In contrast, the legal systems of other pre-WW1 era European countries did not allow the use of European minority languages in primary schools, in cultural institutions, in offices of public administration and at the legal courts.


The arguments used by Hungary concentrated on proving the historical, geographical, economic and spiritual unity of the old Kingdom of Hungary. Yet, the &quot;Memoirs&quot; mixed them all in a confusing way. Hungary also demanded plebiscites as a means to restore the former multi-national Kingdom of Hungary, and not to create a majority Hungarian nation state. The Supreme Council of the Peace Conference, when drawing the Czechoslovak–Hungarian border, applied the principle of mutual balance of minorities in the two states, since, as they claimed, creating a clean and precise ethnic border was impossible. The Supreme Council rejected the maximum demands of the Czechoslovak side, nor did it apply a purely geographical or ethnic principle, but combined them with economical, historical, transportation, military strategical, and other geopolitical factors. The Supreme Council accepted Czechoslovak arguments that showed that post-war Hungary was self-sufficient in coal, crude oil, grain, cattle and other areas of agriculture, railways and transport.

The Hungarian delegation, led by Count Apponyi, arrived in Paris on 7 January 1920 and was informed that the peace conditions would be submitted to him on 15 January. On 14 January, Apponyi publicly protested in the press against the conditions for peace, despite still not knowing their official text. His demand to talk directly with the leading representatives of the Entente before officially receiving the text further irritated the Supreme Council and was declined. It would have meant preferential treatment for the Hungarians, as no other delegation from a defeated state had been given the same advantage. On 15 January, Apponyi received the text of the proposed Peace Treaty in the &quot;Red Hall&quot;, and the next day Apponyi made his prepared speech to the Supreme Council. He called for the right of self-determination of Hungarians, denied that other nations were oppressed in the old Kingdom of Hungary, claimed that Hungary had a historic mission, emphasized the geographical and economic unity of the country, condemned that many Hungarians were now living under the &quot;hegemony of races with lower cultures&quot; and declared that the torso of the historic Hungarian kingdom could not live without the lost regions, without its mineral wealth, water energy and labor force. Hungary would never accept these borders and would follow a policy aimed at its revision. The lengthy negotiation process was recorded on a daily basis by , deputy first secretary of the Hungarian delegation. According to Hronský, it turned out to be a mistake on Hungary&#x27;s part when it appointed Apponyi to lead the Hungarian delegation. Count Apponyi, though popular in Hungary, had a negative reputation in the neighboring countries. His education acts (1907), his pro-German policy during the war and negative relations with the non-Hungarian nationalities of Hungary made him an easy target for the international press. Štefan Osuský, the Czechoslovak ambassador in Paris, did not bother to hide his glee at Hungary choosing Apponyi of all people. &quot;The choice of Apponyi was very welcome to me&quot;, wrote Osuský back to Prague, &quot;In the former Kingdom of Hungary, he embodied the spirit of disregard and oppression of the Slovaks, and as such I would grant to him that he should be the one to sign the sentence of condemnation not only of his life...&quot; The Czechoslovak, Romanian and Yugoslavian delegation decided on a joint approach when replying to the Hungarian memorandums. On 26 February, the Hungarian newspaper &quot;Pesti Hírlap&quot; ridiculed this cooperation as some kind of &quot;Little Entente&quot;.

The treaty of peace in its final form was submitted to the Hungarians on 6 May and signed by them in Grand Trianon on 4 June 1920, entering into force on 26 July 1921. An extensive accompanying letter, written by the Chairman of the Peace Conference Alexandre Millerand, was sent along with the Peace Treaty to Hungary. The letter emphasized that the Great Powers studied the notes provided by the Hungarian delegation, but &quot;could not ignore the partial responsibility which falls on Hungary for the outbreak of the World War and in general for the imperialist policy pursued by the Dual Monarchy&quot; It also mentioned that the &quot;territorial clauses in the peace conditions would not be changed at all, because any change of the frontiers which the Hungarian delegation demanded would have very unfortunate results&quot;. Examination of Hungarian counter-proposals only confirmed to them that the borders should remain as they were drafted in 1919, because &quot;the nationality situation in Central Europe is such that it is not possible to ensure that political borders fully agree with ethnic borders&quot; and thus the Great Powers were forced to leave some populations under the sovereignty of other states. In spite of this, the Great Powers rejected the Hungarian claim &quot;that it would be better to not change the historic borders: The continuation of a situation, even if it is a thousand years old, is not justified if it is against justice.&quot; The belated Hungarian offers for Slovak autonomy within Hungary were dismissed as a diplomatic trick, since &quot;the basic historic fact was that for many years all the efforts of the Hungarian political elite were directed towards silencing the voices of the national minorities.&quot; At the end, Millerand&#x27;s letter categorically emphasized, that &quot;The conditions for peace, which were presented to you today, are, however, definitive.&quot;

The United States did not ratify the Treaty of Trianon. Instead it negotiated a separate peace treaty that did not contradict the terms of the Trianon treaty.

=== Coal Shortage in Hungary and the Peace-Making ===

The Treaty of Trianon not only redrew Hungary&#x27;s borders but also laid down rules for the restoration of economic relations between Hungary and foreign countries, including its neighbors - the Entente allies: Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. The peace treaty de facto ended the Allied blockade of Hungary and de jure ordered the resumption of regional trade and the supply of coal to Hungary from Czechoslovakia and Poland. Together with other international agreements signed at the Paris Peace Conference, such as the Saint-Germain Peace Treaty of 1919 and the Teschen Settlement of July 1920, it provided the legal framework for overcoming the economic chaos in Central Europe caused by the First World War and exacerbated by the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian common market in late 1918.

The critical element of the economic paralysis in Hungary and other Danubian countries was the shortage of coal, which had been aggravating since 1914, but became critical in 1918-1920. While coal production in the Habsburg Monarchy had been declining after 1914, the disappearance of imperial unity at the end of 1918 halted the distribution of coal from the Silesian mines to various consuming regions, including Hungary. Coal production in Hungary fell from 10 million tonnes in 1913 to 3 million tonnes in 1919, but the most drastic blow came from the cessation of imports of 5 million tonnes of rich Silesian bituminous coal. The stoppage of coal imports was mainly due to the blockade imposed by the Czechoslovak government over Hungary at the end of 1918. In fact, Czechs gained control over a significant part of the Silesian mines, such as in Teschen, and over the transit railways from Silesia to Vienna and Budapest. From November-December 1918, Prague made the resumption of coal supplies to Vienna and Budapest conditional on the acceptance of its territorial claims to former Austrian and Hungarian territories.

As the Hungarian revolutionary leader Vilmos Böhm recalled about the Hungarian-Czech coal talks, &quot;every wagon of coal should be paid for with territorial concessions&quot;. Despite the withdrawal of Hungarian troops from the Upper Hungarian territories claimed by Prague (Slovakia in December 1918-January 1919 and Subcarpathian Ruthenia in April-July 1919), Czechoslovakia maintained a blockade on coal exports to Hungary until the signing of the Trianon Peace Treaty in June 1920.

The acute coal shortage had a profound effect on Hungary&#x27;s economy and infrastructure. Industrial production and transport were severely hampered. The shortage led to desperate diplomatic efforts by the government in Budapest to secure coal supplies and stabilise the economy. In November 1918, the Hungarian government began negotiations with Czechoslovakia and the Entente powers to alleviate the coal crisis. Hungary&#x27;s desperate need for coal influenced its diplomatic strategy and led it to make concessions. Hungary also sought help from the Entente, recognising that cooperation with its neighbours and the victorious powers was essential for economic recovery.

Czechoslovakia and the Entente powers strategically used coal supplies as leverage to force Hungary to make territorial and political concessions. The negotiated peace treaty project included passages, which stipulated the obligation of Czechoslovakia and Poland to provide coal to Hungary in necessary quantities, but also assured that the two important coal-mining centers of Hungary – surrounding towns of Pécs and of Salgótarján – would be freed from the occupying Czech and Serbian troops and remain inside Hungary. The great powers understood that Hungary&#x27;s desperate need for coal and trade with neighbouring countries, particularly Czechoslovakia, would force Budapest to accept the heavy territorial losses in favour of Prague. After the ratification of the Trianon Treaty by the Hungarian Parliament in November 1920, Hungary started receiving increasing quantities of coal via Czechoslovakia. During the 1920s, Czechoslovakia became the most important trading partner of Hungary.

== Borders of Hungary ==


The Hungarian government terminated its union with Austria on 31 October 1918, officially dissolving the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy. The &quot;de facto&quot; temporary borders of independent Hungary were defined by the ceasefire lines in November–December 1918. Compared with the pre-war Kingdom of Hungary, these temporary borders did not include:
* Part of Transylvania south of the Mureș River and east of the Someș River, which came under the control of Romania (cease-fire agreement of Belgrade signed on 13 November 1918).
* The General Council of the Saxons in Nagyszeben (now Sibiu in Romania) decided in question of Transylvania to choose clear neutrality, without committing themselves either to the Hungarian or the Romanian side on 25 November 1918.
* The Romanian Army occupied Marosvásárhely (now Târgu Mureș in Romania), the most important town of Székely Land in Transylvania. On the same day the National Assembly of Székelys in Marosvásárhely reaffirms their support to the territorial integrity of Hungary on 25 November 1918.
* On 1 December 1918, the Great National Assembly of Alba Iulia declared union with the Kingdom of Romania.
* In response, a Hungarian General Assembly in Kolozsvár (now Cluj in Romania), the most important Hungarian town in Transylvania, reaffirms the loyalty of Hungarians from Transylvania to Hungary on 22 December 1918.
* Slovakia was proclaimed as part of Czechoslovakia (status quo set by the Czechoslovak legions and accepted by the Entente on 25 November 1918). Afterwards, the Slovak politician Milan Hodža discussed with the Hungarian Minister of Defence, Albert Bartha, a temporary demarcation line that left between 650,000 and 886,000 Hungarians in the newly formed Czechoslovakia and between 142,000 and 399,000 Slovaks in the remainder of Hungary (the discrepancy was caused by the different way census was collected in Hungary and Czechoslovakia). That was signed on 6 December 1918.
* South Slavic lands, which, after the war, were organised into two political formations – the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and Banat, Bačka and Baranja, which both came under control of South Slavs, according to the ceasefire agreement of Belgrade signed on 13 November 1918. Previously, on 29 October 1918, the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia parliament, an autonomous kingdom within Transleithania, terminated the union with the Kingdom of Hungary and on 30 October 1918 the Hungarian diet adopted a motion declaring that the constitutional relations between the two states had ended. Croatia-Slavonia was included in a newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs (which also included some other South Slavic territories, formerly administered by Austria-Hungary) on 29 October 1918. This state and the Kingdom of Serbia formed the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia) on 1 December 1918.
The territories of Banat, Bačka and Baranja (which included most of the pre-war Hungarian counties of Baranya, Bács-Bodrog, Torontál, and Temes) came under military control by the Kingdom of Serbia and political control by local South Slavs. The Great People&#x27;s Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs in Banat, Bačka and Baranja declared union of this region with Serbia on 25 November 1918. The ceasefire line had the character of a temporary international border until the treaty. The central parts of Banat were later assigned to Romania, respecting the wishes of Romanians from this area, which, on 1 December 1918, were present in the National Assembly of Romanians in Alba Iulia, which voted for union with the Kingdom of Romania. 
* The city of Rijeka was occupied by the Italian nationalists group. Its affiliation was a matter of international dispute between the Kingdom of Italy and Yugoslavia.
* Croatian-populated territories in modern Međimurje remained under Hungarian control after the Armistice of Belgrade of 13 November 1918. After the Međimurje was occupied by forces led by Slavko Kvaternik on 24 December 1918, this region declared separation from Hungary and entry into Yugoslavia at the popular assembly of 9 January 1919.

After the Romanian Army advanced beyond this cease-fire line, the Entente powers asked Hungary (Vix Note) to acknowledge the new Romanian territorial gains by a new line set along the Tisza river. Unable to reject these terms and unwilling to accept them, the leaders of the Hungarian Democratic Republic resigned and the Communists seized power. In spite of the country being under Allied blockade, the Hungarian Soviet Republic was formed and the Hungarian Red Army was rapidly set up. This army was initially successful against the Czechoslovak Legions, due to covert food and arms aid from Italy. This made it possible for Hungary to reach nearly the former Galician (Polish) border, thus separating the Czechoslovak and Romanian troops from each other.

After a Hungarian-Czechoslovak cease-fire signed on 1 July 1919, the Hungarian Red Army left parts of Slovakia by 4 July, as the Entente powers promised to invite a Hungarian delegation to the Versailles Peace Conference. In the end, this particular invitation was not issued. Béla Kun, leader of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, then turned the Hungarian Red Army on the Romanian Army and attacked at the Tisza river on 20 July 1919. After fierce fighting that lasted some five days, the Hungarian Red Army collapsed. The Royal Romanian Army marched into Budapest on 4 August 1919.

The Hungarian state was restored by the Entente powers, helping Admiral Horthy into power in November 1919. On 1 December 1919, the Hungarian delegation was officially invited to the Versailles Peace Conference; however, the newly defined borders of Hungary were nearly concluded without the presence of the Hungarians. During prior negotiations, the Hungarian party, along with the Austrian, advocated the American principle of self-determination: that the population of disputed territories should decide by free plebiscite to which country they wished to belong. This view did not prevail for long, as it was disregarded by the decisive French and British delegates. According to some opinions, the Allies drafted the outline of the new frontiers with little or no regard to the historical, cultural, ethnic, geographic, economic and strategic aspects of the region. The Allies assigned territories that were mostly populated by non-Hungarian ethnicities to successor states, but also allowed these states to absorb sizeable territories that were mainly inhabited by Hungarian-speaking populations. For instance, Romania gained all of Transylvania, which was home to 2,800,000 Romanians, but also contained a significant minority of 1,600,000 Hungarians and about 250,000 Germans. The intent of the Allies was principally to strengthen these successor states at the expense of Hungary. Although the countries that were the main beneficiaries of the treaty partially noted the issues, the Hungarian delegates tried to draw attention to them. Their views were disregarded by the Allied representatives.

Some predominantly Hungarian settlements, consisting of more than two million people, were situated in a typically wide strip along the new borders in foreign territory. More concentrated groups were found in Czechoslovakia (parts of southern Slovakia), Yugoslavia (parts of northern Délvidék), and Romania (parts of Transylvania).

The final borders of Hungary were defined by the Treaty of Trianon signed on 4 June 1920. Beside exclusion of the previously mentioned territories, they did not include:
* the rest of Transylvania, which together with some additional parts of the pre-war Kingdom of Hungary became part of Romania;
* Carpathian Ruthenia, which became part of Czechoslovakia, pursuant to the Treaty of Saint-Germain in 1919;
* most of Burgenland, which became part of Austria, also pursuant to the Treaty of Saint-Germain (the district of Sopron opted to remain within Hungary after a plebiscite held in December 1921, the only place where a plebiscite was held and factored in the decision);
* Međimurje and the 2/3 of the Slovene March or &quot;Vendvidék&quot; (now Prekmurje), which became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

By the Treaty of Trianon, the cities of Pécs, Mohács, Baja and Szigetvár, which were under Serb-Croat-Slovene administration after November 1918, were assigned to Hungary. An arbitration committee in 1920 assigned small northern parts of the former Árva and Szepes counties of the Kingdom of Hungary with Polish majority population to Poland. After 1918, Hungary did not have access to the sea, which pre-war Hungary formerly had directly through the Rijeka coastline and indirectly through Croatia-Slavonia.

Representatives of small nations living in the former Austria-Hungary and active in the Congress of Oppressed Nations regarded the treaty of Trianon for being an act of historical righteousness because a better future for their nations was &quot;to be founded and durably assured on the firm basis of world democracy, real and sovereign government by the people, and a universal alliance of the nations vested with the authority of arbitration&quot; while at the same time making a call for putting an end to &quot;the existing unbearable domination of one nation over the other&quot; and making it possible &quot;for nations to organize their relations to each other on the basis of equal rights and free conventions&quot;. Furthermore, they believed the treaty would help toward a new era of dependence on international law, the fraternity of nations, equal rights, and human liberty as well as aid civilisation in the effort to free humanity from international violence.

== Results and consequences ==

Irredentism—the demand for reunification of Hungarian peoples—became a central theme of Hungarian politics and diplomacy.

=== 1910 census ===

The last census before the Treaty of Trianon was held in 1910. This census recorded population by language and religion but not by ethnicity.
On the other hand, in pre-WW1 era Europe, there were only language censuses in a few countries, but the first ethnic censuses were not implemented in Europe until the interwar period.
However, it is generally accepted that the largest ethnic group in the Kingdom of Hungary in this time were the Hungarians. According to the census, speakers of the Hungarian language included approximately 48% of the population of the kingdom (including the autonomous Croatia-Slavonia) and 54% of the population of the territory referred to as &quot;Hungary proper&quot;, i.e. excluding Croatia. Within the borders of &quot;Hungary proper&quot; numerous ethnic minorities were present: 16.1% Romanians, 10.5% Slovaks, 10.4% Germans, 2.5% Ruthenians, 2.5% Serbs and 8% others. 5% of the population of &quot;Hungary proper&quot; were Jews, who were included in speakers of the Hungarian language. The population of the autonomous Croatia-Slavonia was mostly composed of Croats and Serbs (who together counted 87% of population).

==== Criticism of the 1910 census ====
The census of 1910 classified the residents of the Kingdom of Hungary by their native languages and religions, so it presents the preferred language of the individual, which may or may not correspond to the individual&#x27;s ethnic identity. To make the situation even more complex, in the multilingual kingdom there were territories with ethnically mixed populations where people spoke two or even three languages natively. For example, in the territory what is today Slovakia (then part of Upper Hungary) 18% of the Slovaks, 33% of the Hungarians and 65% of the Germans were bilingual. In addition, 21% of the Germans spoke both Slovak and Hungarian beside German. These reasons are ground for debate about the accuracy of the census.

While several demographers (David W. Paul, Peter Hanak, László Katus) state that the outcome of the census is reasonably accurate (assuming that it is also properly interpreted), others believe that the 1910 census was manipulated by exaggerating the percentage of the speakers of Hungarian, pointing to the discrepancy between an improbably high growth of the Hungarian-speaking population and the decrease of percentual participation of speakers of other languages through Magyarization in the late 19th century. For example, the 1921 census in Czechoslovakia (only one year after the Treaty of Trianon) shows 21% Hungarians in Slovakia, compared to 30% based on 1910 census.

Some Slovak demographers (such as and Julius Mesaros) dispute the result of every pre-war census. Owen Johnson, an American historian, accepts the numbers of the earlier censuses up to the one in 1900, according to which the proportion of the Hungarians was 51.4%, but he neglects the 1910 census as he thinks the changes since the last census are too big. It is also argued that there were different results in previous censuses in the Kingdom of Hungary and subsequent censuses in the new states. Considering the size of discrepancies, some demographers are on the opinion that these censuses were somewhat biased in the favour of the respective ruling nation.

The territories of the former Hungarian Kingdom that were ceded by the treaty to neighbouring countries in total (and each of them separately) had a majority of non-Hungarian nationals; however, the Hungarian ethnic area was much larger than the newly established territory of Hungary, therefore 30% of the ethnic Hungarians were under foreign authority.

After the treaty, the percentage and the absolute number of all Hungarian populations outside of Hungary decreased in the next decades (although, some of these populations also recorded temporary increase of the absolute population number). There are several reasons for this population decrease, some of which were spontaneous assimilation and certain state policies, like Slovakization, Romanianization, Serbianisation. Other important factors were the Hungarian migration from the neighbouring states to Hungary or to some western countries as well as decreased birth rate of Hungarian populations. According to the National Office for Refugees, the number of Hungarians who immigrated to Hungary from neighbouring countries was about 350,000 between 1918 and 1924.
==== Minorities in post-Trianon Hungary ====
On the other hand, a considerable number of other nationalities remained within the frontiers of the independent Hungary:

According to the 1920 census 10.4% of the population spoke one of the minority languages as mother language:

* 551,212 German (6.9%)
* 141,882 Slovak (1.8%)
* 36,858 Croatian (0.5%)
* 23,760 Romanian (0.3%)
* 23,228 Bunjevac and Šokac (0.3%)
* 17,131 Serbian (0.2%)
* 7,000 Slovene (0.08%)

The percentage and the absolute number of all non-Hungarian nationalities decreased in the next decades, although the total population of the country increased. Bilingualism was also disappearing. The main reasons of this process were both spontaneous assimilation and the deliberate Magyarization policy of the state. Minorities made up 8% of the total population in 1930 and 7% in 1941 (on the post-Trianon territory).

After World War II approximately 200,000 Germans were deported to Germany, according to the decree of the Potsdam Conference. Under the forced exchange of population between Czechoslovakia and Hungary, approximately 73,000 Slovaks left Hungary and according to different estimations 120,500 or 45,000 Hungarians moved to present day Hungarian territory from Czechoslovakia. After these population movements, Hungary became a nearly ethnically homogeneous country.

=== Political consequences ===

Officially the treaty was intended to be a confirmation of the right of self-determination for nations and of the concept of nation-states replacing the old multinational Austro-Hungarian empire. Although the treaty addressed some nationality issues, it also sparked some new ones.

The minority ethnic groups of the pre-war kingdom were the major beneficiaries. The Allies had explicitly committed themselves to the causes of the minority peoples of Austria-Hungary late in World War I. For all intents and purposes, the death knell of the Austro-Hungarian empire sounded on 14 October 1918, when United States Secretary of State Robert Lansing informed Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister István Burián that autonomy for the nationalities was no longer enough. Accordingly, the Allies assumed without question that the minority ethnic groups of the pre-war kingdom wanted to leave Hungary. The Romanians joined their ethnic brethren in Romania, while the Slovaks, Serbs and Croats helped establish states of their own (Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia). However, these new or enlarged countries also absorbed large slices of territory with a majority of ethnic Hungarians or Hungarian speaking population. As a result, as many as a third of Hungarian language-speakers found themselves outside the borders of the post-Trianon Hungary.

While the territories that were now outside Hungary&#x27;s borders had non-Hungarian majorities overall, there also existed some sizeable areas with a majority of Hungarians, largely near the newly defined borders. Over the last century, concerns have been raised frequently about the treatment of these ethnic Hungarian communities in the neighbouring states. Areas with significant Hungarian populations included the Székely Land in eastern Transylvania, the area along the newly defined Romanian-Hungarian border (cities of Arad, Oradea), the area north of the newly defined Czechoslovak–Hungarian border (Komárno, Csallóköz), southern parts of Subcarpathia and northern parts of Vojvodina.

The Allies rejected the idea of plebiscites in the disputed areas with the exception of the city of Sopron, which voted in favour of Hungary. The Allies were indifferent as to the exact line of the newly defined border between Austria and Hungary. Furthermore, ethnically diverse Transylvania, with an overall Romanian majority (53.8% – 1910 census data or 57.1% – 1919 census data or 57.3% – 1920 census data), was treated as a single entity at the peace negotiations and was assigned in its entirety to Romania. The option of partition along ethnic lines as an alternative was rejected.

Another reason why the victorious Allies decided to dissolve the Austria-Hungary was to prevent Germany from acquiring substantial influence in the future, since Austria-Hungary was a strong German supporter and fast developing region. The Western powers&#x27; main priority was to prevent a resurgence of the German Reich, and they therefore decided that her allies in the region should be &quot;contained&quot; by a ring of states friendly to the Allies, each of which would be bigger than either Austria or Hungary. Compared to the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, post-Trianon Hungary had 60% less population, and its political and economic footprint in the region was significantly reduced. Hungary lost connection to strategic military and economic infrastructure because of the concentric layout of the railway and road network, which the borders bisected. In addition, the structure of its economy collapsed because it had relied on other parts of the pre-war kingdom. The country lost access to the Mediterranean and to the important sea port of Rijeka (Fiume) and became landlocked, which had a negative effect on sea trading and strategic naval operations. Many trading routes that went through the newly defined borders from various parts of the pre-war kingdom were abandoned.

With regard to the ethnic issues, the Western powers were aware of the problem posed by the presence of so many Hungarians (and Germans) living outside the newly formed states of Hungary and Austria. The Romanian delegation to Versailles feared in 1919 that the Allies were beginning to favour the partition of Transylvania along ethnic lines to reduce the potential exodus, and Prime Minister Ion I. C. Brătianu even summoned British-born Queen Marie to France to strengthen their case. The Romanians had suffered a higher &quot;relative&quot; casualty rate in the war than either Britain or France so it was considered that the Western powers had a moral debt to repay. In &quot;absolute&quot; terms, Romanian troops had considerably fewer casualties than either Britain or France, however. The underlying reason for the decision was a secret pact between The Entente and Romania. In the Treaty of Bucharest (1916) Romania was promised Transylvania and some other territories to the east of river Tisza, provided that she attacked Austria-Hungary from the south-east, where defences were weak. However, after the Central Powers had noticed the military manoeuvre, the attempt was quickly choked off and Bucharest fell in the same year.

By the time the victorious Allies arrived in France, the treaty was already settled, which made the outcome inevitable. At the heart of the dispute lay fundamentally different views on the nature of the Hungarian presence in the disputed territories. For Hungarians, the outer territories were not seen as colonial territories but rather part of the core national territory. The non-Hungarians that lived in the Pannonian Basin saw the Hungarians as colonial-style rulers who had oppressed the Slavs and Romanians since 1848, when they introduced laws that the language used in education and in local offices was to be Hungarian. For non-Hungarians from the Pannonian Basin it was a process of decolonisation instead of a punitive dismemberment (as was seen by the Hungarians). The Hungarians did not see it this way because the newly defined borders did not fully respect territorial distribution of ethnic groups, with areas where there were Hungarian majorities outside the new borders. The French sided with their allies the Romanians who had a long policy of cultural ties to France since the country broke from the Ottoman Empire (partly because of the relative ease at which Romanians could learn French) although Clemenceau personally detested Brătianu. President Wilson initially supported the outline of a border that would have more respect to ethnic distribution of population based on the &quot;Coolidge Report,&quot; led by Archibald Cary Coolidge, a Harvard professor, but later gave in because of changing international politics and as a courtesy to other allies.

For Hungarian public opinion, the fact that almost three-fourths of the pre-war kingdom&#x27;s territory and a significant number of ethnic Hungarians were assigned to neighbouring countries triggered considerable bitterness. Most Hungarians preferred to maintain the territorial integrity of the pre-war kingdom. The Hungarian politicians claimed that they were ready to give the non-Hungarian ethnicities a great deal of autonomy. Most Hungarians regarded the treaty as an insult to the nation&#x27;s honour. The Hungarian political attitude towards Trianon was summed up in the phrases &quot;Nem, nem, soha!&quot; (&quot;No, no, never!&quot;) and &quot;Mindent vissza!&quot; (&quot;Return everything!&quot; or &quot;Everything back!&quot;). The perceived humiliation of the treaty became a dominant theme in inter-war Hungarian politics, analogous with the German reaction to the Treaty of Versailles.

By the arbitrations of Germany and Italy, Hungary expanded its borders towards neighbouring countries before and during World War II. This started by the First Vienna Award, then was continued with the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1939 (annexation of the remainder of Carpathian Ruthenia and a small strip from eastern Slovakia), afterwards by the Second Vienna Award in 1940, and finally by the annexations of territories after the breakup of Yugoslavia. This territorial expansion was short-lived, since the post-war Hungarian boundaries in the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947 were nearly identical to those of 1920 (with three villages – Horvátjárfalu, Oroszvár, and Dunacsún – transferred to Czechoslovakia).

==== Legacy ====

Francesco Saverio Nitti served as Prime Minister of Italy between 1919 and 1920. Italy was a member of the Entente and participated in the treaty, he wrote in &quot;Peaceless Europe&quot; (1922):

==== In modern historiography ====

The treaty&#x27;s perceived disproportion has had a lasting impact on Hungarian politics and culture, with some commentators even likening it to a &quot;collective pathology&quot; that places Trianon into a much larger narrative of Hungarian victimhood at the hands of foreign powers. Within Hungary, Trianon is often referred to as a &quot;diktat&quot;, &quot;tragedy&quot;, and &quot;trauma&quot;. According to a study, two-thirds of Hungarians agreed in 2020 that parts of neighbouring countries should belong to them, the highest percentage in any NATO country. Such irredentism was one of the main contributing factors to Hungary&#x27;s decision to enter World War II as an Axis power as Adolf Hitler had promised to intervene on Hungary&#x27;s behalf to restore majority-ethnic Hungarian lands lost after Trianon.

Hungarian bitterness at Trianon was also a source of regional tension after the Cold War ended in 1989. For example, Hungary attracted international media attention in 1999 for passing the &quot;status law&quot; concerning estimated three-million ethnic Hungarian minorities in neighbouring Romania, Slovakia, Serbia and Montenegro, Croatia, Slovenia and Ukraine. The law aimed to provide education, health benefits and employment rights to these minorities as a means of providing reparations for Trianon&#x27;s negative consequences.

Trianon&#x27;s legacy is similarly implicated in the question of whether to grant extraterritorial ethnic Hungarians citizenship, an important issue in contemporary Hungarian politics. In 2004, a majority of voters approved extending citizenship to ethnic Hungarians in a referendum, which nonetheless failed due to low turnout. In 2011, Viktor Orbán&#x27;s newly formed government liberalized the nationality law by statute. Although Orbán depicted the new law as redressing Trianon, many commentators speculated about an additional political motivation; the law granted voting rights to extraterritorial Hungarians, who were seen as a reliable base of support for Orbán&#x27;s national-conservative Fidesz party.

=== Economic consequences ===

The Austro-Hungarian Empire was one economic unit with autarkic characteristics during its golden age and therefore achieved rapid growth, especially in the early 20th century when GNP grew by 1.46%. This level of growth compared very favourably to that of other European states such as Britain (1.00%), France (1.06%), and Germany (1.51%). There was also a division of labour present throughout the empire: that is, in the Austrian part of the monarchy manufacturing industries were highly advanced, while in the Kingdom of Hungary an agro-industrial economy had emerged. By the late 19th century, economic growth of the eastern regions consistently surpassed that of western, thus discrepancies eventually began to diminish. The key success of fast development was specialisation of each region in fields that they were best.

The Kingdom of Hungary was the main supplier of wheat, rye, barley and other various goods in the empire, and these comprised a large portion of the empire&#x27;s exports. Meanwhile, the territory of present-day Czech Republic (Kingdom of Bohemia) owned 75% of the whole industrial capacity of former Austria-Hungary. This shows that the various parts of the former monarchy were economically interdependent. As a further illustration of this issue, post-Trianon Hungary produced 5 times more agricultural goods than it needed for itself, and mills around Budapest (some of the largest ones in Europe at the time) operated at 20% capacity. As a consequence of the treaty, all the competitive industries of the former empire were compelled to close doors, as great capacity was met by negligible demand owing to economic barriers presented in the form of the newly defined borders.

Post-Trianon Hungary possessed 90% of the engineering and printing industry of the pre-war kingdom, while only 11% of timber and 16% of iron was retained. In addition, 61% of arable land, 74% of public roads, 65% of canals, 62% of railroads, 64% of hard surface roads, 83% of pig iron output, 55% of industrial plants, and 67% of credit and banking institutions of the former Kingdom of Hungary lay within the territory of Hungary&#x27;s neighbours. These statistics correspond to post-Trianon Hungary retaining only around a third of the kingdom&#x27;s territory before the war and around 60% of its population. The new borders also bisected transport links – in the Kingdom of Hungary the road and railway network had a radial structure, with Budapest in the centre. Many roads and railways, running along the newly defined borders and interlinking radial transport lines, ended up in different, highly introvert countries. Hence, much of the rail cargo traffic of the emergent states was virtually paralysed. These factors all combined created some imbalances in the now separated economic regions of the former monarchy.
The disseminating economic problems had been also noted in the &quot;Coolidge Report&quot; as a serious potential aftermath of the treaty. This opinion was not taken into account during the negotiations. Thus, the resulting uneasiness and despondency of one part of the concerned population was later one of the main antecedents of World War II. Unemployment levels in Austria, as well as in Hungary, were dangerously high, and industrial output dropped by 65%. What happened to Austria in industry happened to Hungary in agriculture where production of grain declined by more than 70%. Austria, especially the imperial capital Vienna, was a leading investor of development projects throughout the empire with more than 2.2 billion crown capital. This sum sunk to a mere 8.6 million crowns after the treaty took effect and resulted in a starving of capital in other regions of the former empire.

The disintegration of the multinational state conversely impacted neighbouring countries, too: In Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria a fifth to a third of the rural population could find no work, and industry was in no position to absorb them. In comparison, by 1921 the new Czechoslovak state reached 75% of its pre-war production owing to their favourable position among the victors and greater associated access to international rehabilitation resources.

With the creation of customs barriers and fragmented protective economies, the economic growth and outlook in the region sharply declined, ultimately culminating in a deep recession. It proved to be immensely challenging for the successor states to successfully transform their economies to adapt to the new circumstances. All the formal districts of Austria-Hungary used to rely on each other&#x27;s exports for growth and welfare; by contrast, 5 years after the treaty, traffic of goods between the countries dropped to less than 5% of its former value. This could be attributed to the introduction of aggressive nationalistic policies by local political leaders.

The drastic shift in economic climate forced the countries to re-evaluate their situation and to promote industries where they had fallen short. Austria and Czechoslovakia subsidised the mill, sugar and brewing industries, while Hungary attempted to increase the efficiency of iron, steel, glass and chemical industries. The stated objective was that all countries should become self-sufficient. This tendency, however, led to uniform economies and competitive economic advantage of long well-established industries and research fields evaporated. The lack of specialisation adversely affected the whole Danube-Carpathian region and caused a distinct setback of growth and development compared to western and northern European regions as well as high financial vulnerability and instability.

=== Other consequences ===

Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia had to assume part of the financial obligations of the former Kingdom of Hungary on account of the parts of its former territory that were assigned under their sovereignty. Some conditions of the treaty were similar to those imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles. After the war, the Austro-Hungarian navy, air force and army were disbanded. The army of post-Trianon Hungary was to be restricted to 35,000 men, and there was to be no conscription. Heavy artillery, tanks and air force were prohibited. No railway was to be built with more than one track, because at that time railways held substantial strategic importance economically and militarily.

Articles 54–60 of the treaty required Hungary to recognise various rights of national minorities within its borders. Articles 61–66 state that all former citizens of the Kingdom of Hungary living outside the newly defined frontiers of Hungary were to &quot;ipso facto&quot; lose their Hungarian citizenship in one year. Under articles 79 to 101 Hungary renounced all privileges of the former Austro-Hungarian monarchy in territories outside Europe, including Morocco, Egypt, Siam and China.

<text>Toes are the digits of the foot of a tetrapod. Animal species such as cats that walk on their toes are described as being &quot;digitigrade&quot;. Humans, and other animals that walk on the soles of their feet, are described as being &quot;plantigrade&quot;; &quot;unguligrade&quot; animals are those that walk on hooves at the tips of their toes.

==Structure==


There are normally five toes present on each human foot. Each toe consists of three phalanx bones, the proximal, middle, and distal, with the exception of the big toe (). For a minority of people, the little toe also is missing a middle bone. The hallux only contains two phalanx bones, the proximal and distal. The joints between each phalanx are the interphalangeal joints. The proximal phalanx bone of each toe articulates with the metatarsal bone of the foot at the metatarsophalangeal joint. Each toe is surrounded by skin, and present on all five toes is a toenail.

The toes are, from medial to lateral: 

* the first toe, also known as the hallux (&quot;big toe&quot;, &quot;great toe&quot;, &quot;thumb toe&quot;), the innermost toe;
* the second toe, (&quot;index toe&quot;, &quot;pointer toe&quot;);
* the third toe, (&quot;middle toe&quot;);
* the fourth toe, (&quot;fore toe&quot;, &quot;ring toe&quot;);
* the fifth toe, (&quot;baby toe&quot;, &quot;little toe&quot;, &quot;pinky toe&quot;, &quot;small toe&quot;), the outermost toe.

===Muscles===

Toe movement is generally flexion and extension (movement toward the sole or the back of the foot, resp.) via muscular tendons that attach to the toes on the anterior and superior surfaces of the phalanx bones.

With the exception of the hallux, toe movement is generally governed by action of the flexor digitorum brevis and extensor digitorum brevis muscles. These attach to the sides of the bones, making it impossible to move individual toes independently. Muscles between the toes on their top and bottom also help to abduct and adduct the toes. The hallux and little toe have unique muscles:
* The hallux is primarily flexed by the flexor hallucis longus muscle, located in the deep posterior of the lower leg, via the flexor hallucis longus tendon. Additional flexion control is provided by the flexor hallucis brevis. It is extended by the abductor hallucis muscle and the adductor hallucis muscle. 
* The little toe has a separate set of control muscles and tendon attachments, the flexor and abductor digiti minimi. Numerous other foot muscles contribute to fine motor control of the foot. The connective tendons between the minor toes account for the inability to actuate individual toes.

===Blood supply===
The toes receive blood from the digital branches of the plantar metatarsal arteries and drain blood into the dorsal venous arch of the foot.

===Nerve supply===
Sensation to the skin of the toes is provided by five nerves. The superficial fibular nerve supplies sensation to the top of the toes, except between the hallux and second toe, which is supplied by the deep fibular nerve, and the outer surface of the fifth toe, supplied by the sural nerve. Sensation to the bottom of the toes is supplied by the medial plantar nerve, which supplies sensation to the great toe and inner three-and-a-half toes, and the lateral plantar nerve, which supplies sensation to the little toe and half of the sensation of the fourth toe.

In humans, the hallux is usually longer than the second toe, but in some individuals, it may not be the longest toe. There is an inherited trait in humans, where the dominant gene causes a longer second toe (&quot;Morton&#x27;s toe&quot; or &quot;Greek foot&quot;) while the homozygous recessive genotype presents with the more common trait: a longer hallux. People with the rare genetic disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva characteristically have a short hallux which appears to turn inward, or medially, in relation to the foot.

===Variation===
Humans usually have five toes on each foot. When more than five toes are present, this is known as polydactyly. Other variants may include syndactyly or arachnodactyly. Forefoot shape, including toe shape, exhibits significant variation among people; these differences can be measured and have been statistically correlated with ethnicity. Such deviations may affect comfort and fit for various shoe types. Research conducted for the U.S. Army indicated that larger feet may still have smaller arches, toe length, and toe-breadth.

==Function==
The human foot consists of multiple bones and soft tissues which support the weight of the upright human. Specifically, the toes assist the human while walking, providing balance, weight-bearing, and thrust during gait.

==Clinical significance==
A sprain or strain to the small interphalangeal joints of the toe is commonly called a stubbed toe. A sprain or strain where the toe joins to the foot is called turf toe.

Long-term use of improperly sized shoes can cause misalignment of toes, as well as other orthopedic problems.

Morton&#x27;s neuroma commonly results in pain and numbness between the third and fourth toes of the sufferer, due to it affecting the nerve between the third and fourth metatarsal bones.

The big toe is also the most common locus of ingrown nails, and its proximal phalanx joint is the most common locus for gout attacks.

===Deformity===

Deformities of the foot include hammer toe, trigger toe, and claw toe. Hammer toe can be described as an abnormal contraction or “buckling” of a toe. This is done by a partial or complete dislocation of one of the joints, which form the toes. Since the toes are deformed further, these may press against a shoe and cause pain. Deformities of the foot can also be caused by rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus. Deformities may predispose to ulcers and pain, especially when shoe-wearing.

A common problem involving the big toe is the formation of bunions. These are structural deformities of the bones and the joint between the foot and big toe, and may be painful. Similar deformity involving the fifth toe is described as tailor&#x27;s bunion or bunionette.

In polydactyly (which can also affect the fingers) one or more extra toes are present.

===In reconstruction===
A favourable option for the reconstruction of missing adjacent fingers/multiple digit amputations, i.e. such as a metacarpal hand reconstruction, is to have a combined second and third toe transplantation. Third and fourth toe transplantation to the hand in replacing lost fingers is also a viable option.

==History==

===Etymology===
The Old English term for &quot;toe&quot; is (plural ). This is a contraction of , and derives from Proto-Germanic (cognates: Old Norse , Old Frisian , Middle Dutch , Dutch (perhaps originally a plural), Old High German , German ), perhaps originally meaning &#x27;fingers&#x27; as well (many Indo-European languages use one word to mean both &#x27;fingers&#x27; and &#x27;toes&#x27;, e.g. &quot;digit&quot;), and thus from PIE root — &#x27;to show&#x27;.


In classical Latin, , , and , with genitive and , are used to refer to the big toe. The form (genitive, ) currently in use is however a blend word of the aforementioned forms. Compare , the equivalent term for the thumb.

=== Evolution ===
Haeckel traces the standard vertebrate five-toed schema from fish fins via amphibian ancestors.

==Other animals==

In birds with anisodactyl or heterodactyl feet, the hallux is opposed or directed backwards and allows for grasping and perching.

While the thumb is often mentioned as one of the signature characteristics in humans, this manual digit remains partially primitive and is actually present in all primates. In humans, the most derived digital feature is the hallux.

<text>Sir Run Run Shaw (born Shao Renleng; 19 November 1907 – 7 January 2014), also known as Shao Yifu and Siu Yat-fu, was a Hong Kong businessman, filmmaker, and philanthropist. He was one of the foremost influential movie moguls in the East Asian and Hong Kong entertainment industry. He founded the Shaw Brothers Studio, one of the largest film production companies in Hong Kong, and TVB, the dominant television company in Hong Kong.

A well-known philanthropist, Shaw donated billions of Hong Kong dollars to educational institutions in Hong Kong and mainland China. More than 5,000 buildings on Chinese college campuses bear his name, as does Shaw College of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He also established the Shaw Prize for Astronomy, Life Science &amp; Medicine and Mathematical Sciences.

Shaw was born in Ningbo city, as the youngest of the six sons of a Ningbo textile merchant who was based in Shanghai, Shaw Yuh Hsuen () (1866–1921) and his wife, Huang Shun Xiang () (1871–1939). His name at birth was Shao Renleng (), which was later changed to Shao Yifu (邵逸夫) because he thought that the average Chinese person would not know how to pronounce the character (&quot;léng&quot;). There are a number of explanations given for the use of his English name Run Run Shaw, but Shaw reportedly said that it was simply a transcription of his birth name Shao Renleng in the Ningbo dialect.

He celebrated his birthdays on the 14th day of the 10th month of the Chinese calendar, which fell in November 2007, his 100th Lunar Calendar birthday. However, the 14th day of the 10th month of the Chinese calendar corresponds to 19 November 1907 on the Gregorian calendar, which according to &quot;China Daily&quot; was his birthdate.

As a child, his family moved to Shanghai. He graduated from the Shanghai YMCA School, where he learned English.

==Career==

===Early ventures===

In 1925, Shaw&#x27;s brothers, led by the eldest brother Runje Shaw, established Tianyi Film Company (also called Unique Film Productions) in Shanghai, and Run Run Shaw began his film career doing odd jobs for the company. In 1927, Run Run Shaw, then 19 years old, went to Singapore to assist his third elder brother Runme Shaw in their business venture there, initially to market films to Southeast Asia&#x27;s Chinese community. They established the company that would later become the Shaw Organisation, and were involved in distributing and producing films in Southeast Asia. Tianyi produced what is considered the first sound-on-film Chinese talkie in 1931, and made the first Cantonese sound film in 1932. It was highly successful, and Tianyi established a branch in Hong Kong in 1934.

Just before the Japanese invasion of Shanghai in 1937, Tianyi moved its operation to Hong Kong, shipping its equipment from Shanghai. Its studio in Shanghai was destroyed when the Japanese occupied the city. In Hong Kong, Tianyi was reorganised as Nanyang Studio, which later became Shaw Brothers Studio. Run Run Shaw was credited with scripting and directing the 1937 comedy film &quot;Country Bumpkin Visits His In-laws&quot;.

In his early days in Singapore, Run Run Shaw supervised the company&#x27;s business while Runme travelled north to Malaya to establish ties with local theatre owners. In 1927, having noticed that there were few cinemas in Malaya, Runme decided to open four cinemas there to show their films. By 1939, the brothers owned a chain of 139 cinemas across the region; the chain would later include Singapore&#x27;s first air-conditioned cinema, at Beach Road. They also established a number of amusement parks throughout the region, including Borneo, Thailand and Java, such as the Great World Amusement Park at Kim Seng Road. The brothers began to make Malay films in Singapore in 1937. Inspired by the success of films intended for Malay audiences, for example &quot;Leila Majnun&quot; in 1934, and other films from the Dutch East Indies, the brothers established Malay Film Productions (MFP). This company would eventually produce over 160 Malay films, many of them starring and directed by P. Ramlee, until their studio at Jalan Ampas ceased production in 1967. The period between the end of the 1940s and the beginning of the 1960s is known as the Golden Age of Malay Cinema, with over 300 films made between MFP and Cathay Keris. In 1941, the Japanese invaded Singapore and Malaya and confiscated their film equipment. According to Run Run Shaw, he and his brother went into hiding during the war and buried more than $4 million in gold, jewellery and cash in their backyard, digging it up after the war and using it to rebuild their business.

===Shaw Brothers Studios===

In 1957, Run Run Shaw moved to Hong Kong, which was emerging as the new centre of Chinese-language cinema, and reorganised Tianyi&#x27;s operations there as Shaw Brothers Studio. Shaw copied Hollywood by setting up a permanent production site where his actors worked and lived on 46 acres purchased from the government in Clearwater Bay. At the opening of the Shaw Movietown in December 1961, Shaw Studios had the world&#x27;s largest privately owned film-production outfit with about 1,200 workers shooting and editing films daily. Shaw productions ran up to two hours and cost as much as $50,000, a lavish sum by Asian standards in the 1960s.

By the 1960s, Shaw Brothers had become the biggest producer of movies in Asia. Notable films produced by Shaw include director Li Han-hsiang&#x27;s &quot;The Magnificent Concubine&quot;, which took the Grand Prix at the 1962 Cannes Film Festival; the 1963 blockbuster musical film &quot;The Love Eterne&quot;, also directed by Li Han-hsiang; King Hu&#x27;s 1966 pioneering wuxia film &quot;Come Drink with Me&quot;; and Chang Cheh&#x27;s 1967 &quot;The One-Armed Swordsman&quot;, which broke box office records. His companies in Shanghai, Singapore and Hong Kong made more than 1,000 movies, with annual production peaking at 50 pictures in 1974 when Shaw was described as the &quot;Czar of Asian Movies&quot;. The popular nostalgic costume dramas of Shaw Brothers celebrated traditional Chinese values and culture, which was in contrast to the then anti-traditional ideology of Communist mainland China (particularly during the Cultural Revolution), but fit with the policy of the Nationalist government of Taiwan and US anti-Communist strategy, while not conflicting with the less provocative approach of the colonial government of Hong Kong. Shaw Studios also popularised an early (Wuxia) variant of kung fu film genre that had influence on directors such as John Woo and Quentin Tarantino.

The studio, which held virtual monopoly of filmmaking in Hong Kong, declined in the 1970s, partly due to competition from Golden Harvest formed by Raymond Chow and employing many former ex-employees of Shaw that have been dismissed. Golden Harvest came to prominence through Bruce Lee whom Shaw Brothers had previously turned down. Shaw began to focus his efforts on television. Shaw also looked for opportunities in the United States and co-produced a handful of US films, including the 1982 sci-fi classic &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. In 2000, through his company, Shaw Brothers (Hong Kong) Limited, he sold his library of 760 classic titles to Celestial Pictures Limited. Shaw Studios also entered a new era with Shaw&#x27;s majority investment (through his various holding companies) in the US$180,000,000 Hong Kong Movie City project, a studio and production facility in Tseung Kwan O.

===Television Broadcasts Limited===

In 1967, he co-founded TVB, the first free-to-air television station in Hong Kong, growing it into a multibillion-dollar TV empire with channels broadcast in 30 markets including the US, Canada and Taiwan, making it the world&#x27;s largest producer of Chinese-language programs. Shaw took a greater interest in TVB after succeeding the deceased Harold Lee as its chairman in 1980. Shaw leased most of Shaw Brothers&#x27; filmmaking facilities to TVB in 1983. Under his chairmanship, TVB successfully launched the careers of international stars such as Chow Yun-fat and Maggie Cheung, singers such as Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui, and directors like Wong Kar-wai. In 2006, TVB had 80 percent of Hong Kong&#x27;s viewers and 78 percent of the city&#x27;s TV advertising market.

On 31 December 2011, Shaw retired as chairman of Television Broadcasts Ltd. at the age of 104 after more than 40 years at Hong Kong&#x27;s biggest television company, after selling his controlling stake to a group of investors including HTC Corporation chairman Cher Wang and ITC Corporation chairman Charles Chan for HK$6.26 billion in March. He was then named chairman emeritus. Shaw was one of the largest shareholders in Macy&#x27;s after buying 10 percent of its preferred shares for US$50 million when it was nearly bankrupt in 1991.

==Community life==

Shaw was an advocate and financial supporter of the Hong Kong Arts Festival in which he became the first chairman of the festival. He was also the chairman of the Hong Kong Arts Centre&#x27;s board of governors. He was a member of the board of trustees of United College, one of the colleges of the Chinese University of Hong Kong when the university began in 1967. He became the vice-chairman of the board of trustees in 1972 and was appointed to the University Council of the Chinese University in 1977. Other public posts included vice-president of the Hong Kong Girl Guides Association and the Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation. He was also the first Asian president of the Hong Kong Red Cross, and a leading figure in the fund raising of the Community Chest of Hong Kong since its inception.

==Philanthropy==

Over the years, Shaw donated HK$6.5 billion to charities, schools and hospitals in Hong Kong and mainland China through the Sir Run Run Shaw Charitable Trust and the Shaw Foundation, including donations of HK$4.75 billion to educational institutions in mainland China, which helped to build 6,013 construction projects ranging from primary schools to university libraries. More than 5,000 buildings in China&#x27;s college campuses bear Shaw&#x27;s Chinese name, &quot;Yifu&quot;, which has become so ubiquitous that many mistake it as a generic name. Shaw College, the fourth constituent college of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, is also named after him, whose donations made the establishment of the college possible. His other major donations include 10 million British pounds in 1990 to help establish the Run Run Shaw Institute of Chinese Affairs at Oxford University, and US$13 million for disaster relief after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.

===Shaw Prize===

In 2002, Shaw established an international award, the Shaw Prize, for scientists in three areas of research, namely astronomy, mathematics, and life and medical science. The award is up to US$1 million, and the first prize was awarded in 2004.

==Personal life==

He was the sixth of the seven children in the Shaw family, and was nicknamed Uncle Six (&quot;Luk Sook&quot;). His three elder brothers, Runje Shaw, Runde Shaw and Runme Shaw, were all heads of the Shaw Studio. Runme Shaw, the third elder brother, who co-founded the Shaw Studio with him, died in 1985.

Shaw&#x27;s first wife was Lily Wong Mee-chun, who died at age 85 in 1987. In 1997, he married Mona Fong in Las Vegas. A former singer, Mona Fong joined TVB as a procurement manager in 1969 and became the deputy chairman of TVB in 2000. Shaw had four children with his first wife: sons Vee Meng and Harold, and daughters Violet and Dorothy. All of his children studied at Oxford University.

Shaw was a lover of Rolls-Royce limousines and a keen practitioner of qigong. &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; was reportedly his favourite show.

==Death==

He died at his residence on 7 January 2014, aged 106, and survived by his four children, nine grandchildren and several great-grandchildren. The family did not give the cause of death.

His body was transferred from the United Christian Hospital to the Hong Kong Funeral Home in North Point on 10 January 2014. Many local leaders attended the funeral that day, including former chief executives Tung Chee-hwa and Donald Tsang. Shaw&#x27;s remains were brought to the Cape Collinson Crematorium in Chai Wan later the same day. PRC president Xi Jinping, former premier Wen Jiabao and National People&#x27;s Congress chairman Zhang Dejiang sent messages of respect.

==Honours==

In 1964, after their discovery of a small main belt asteroid between Mars and Jupiter, Chinese astronomers at the Purple Mountain Observatory named it &quot;2899 Runrun Shaw&quot; in Shaw&#x27;s honour.

In 1974, Shaw was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). He received a knighthood in 1977 from Queen Elizabeth II and the Grand Bauhinia Medal (GBM) from the Hong Kong government in 1998.

He was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Social Science by the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1981 for his contribution to the university and community. In 1984, he was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by the University of Hong Kong to honour an outstanding contribution to applied visual arts, as well as to the community and cultural developments.

In 2007, coinciding with his 100th birthday, he was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Hong Kong Film Awards.

In 2013, Shaw received the BAFTA Special Award for his outstanding contribution to cinema.

<text>Structural induction is a proof method that is used in mathematical logic (e.g., in the proof of Łoś&#x27; theorem), computer science, graph theory, and some other mathematical fields. It is a generalization of mathematical induction over natural numbers and can be further generalized to arbitrary Noetherian induction. Structural recursion is a recursion method bearing the same relationship to structural induction as ordinary recursion bears to ordinary mathematical induction.

Structural induction is used to prove that some proposition holds for all of some sort of recursively defined structure, such as
formulas, lists, or trees. A well-founded partial order is defined on the structures (&quot;subformula&quot; for formulas, &quot;sublist&quot; for lists, and &quot;subtree&quot; for trees). The structural induction proof is a proof that the proposition holds for all the minimal structures and that if it holds for the immediate substructures of a certain structure , then it must hold for also. (Formally speaking, this then satisfies the premises of an axiom of well-founded induction, which asserts that these two conditions are sufficient for the proposition to hold for all .)

A structurally recursive function uses the same idea to define a recursive function: &quot;base cases&quot; handle each minimal structure and a rule for recursion. Structural recursion is usually proved correct by structural induction; in particularly easy cases, the inductive step is often left out. The &quot;length&quot; and ++ functions in the example below are structurally recursive.

For example, if the structures are lists, one usually introduces the partial order &quot;&lt;&quot;, in which whenever list is the tail of list . Under this ordering, the empty list is the unique minimal element. A structural induction proof of some proposition then consists of two parts: A proof that is true and a proof that if is true for some list , and if is the tail of list , then must also be true.

Eventually, there may exist more than one base case and/or more than one inductive case, depending on how the function or structure was constructed. In those cases, a structural induction proof of some proposition then consists of: 
==Examples==
An ancestor tree is a commonly known data structure, showing the parents, grandparents, etc. of a person as far as known (see picture for an example). It is recursively defined:
* in the simplest case, an ancestor tree shows just one person (if nothing is known about their parents);
* alternatively, an ancestor tree shows one person and, connected by branches, the two ancestor subtrees of their parents (using for brevity of proof the simplifying assumption that if one of them is known, both are).

As an example, the property &quot;An ancestor tree extending over generations shows at most persons&quot; can be proven by structural induction as follows:
* In the simplest case, the tree shows just one person and hence one generation; the property is true for such a tree, since .
* Alternatively, the tree shows one person and their parents&#x27; trees. Since each of the latter is a substructure of the whole tree, it can be assumed to satisfy the property to be proven (a.k.a. the &quot;induction hypothesis&quot;). That is, and can be assumed, where and denotes the number of generations the father&#x27;s and the mother&#x27;s subtree extends over, respectively, and and denote the numbers of persons they show.
** In case , the whole tree extends over generations and shows persons, andformula_1i.e. the whole tree satisfies the property.
** In case , the whole tree extends over generations and shows persons by similar reasoning, i.e. the whole tree satisfies the property in this case also.
Hence, by structural induction, each ancestor tree satisfies the property.

As another, more formal example, consider the following property of lists :

:formula_2

Here denotes the list concatenation operation, the list length, and and are lists.

In order to prove this, we need definitions for length and for the concatenation operation. Let denote a list whose head (first element) is and whose tail (list of remaining elements) is , and let denote the empty list. The definitions for length and the concatenation operation are:

:formula_3

Our proposition is that is true for all lists when is . We want to show that is true for all lists . We will prove this by structural induction on lists.

First we will prove that is true; that is, is true for all lists when happens to be the empty list . Consider :

:formula_4

So this part of the theorem is proved; is true for all , when is , because the left-hand side and the right-hand side are equal.

Next, consider any nonempty list . Since is nonempty, it has a head item, , and a tail list, , so we can express it as . The induction hypothesis is that is true for all values of when is :

:formula_5

We would like to show that if this is the case, then is also true for all values of when . We proceed as before:

:formula_6

Thus, from structural induction, we obtain that is true for all lists .

==Well-ordering==

Just as standard mathematical induction is equivalent to the well-ordering principle, structural induction is also equivalent to a well-ordering principle. If the set of all structures of a certain kind admits a well-founded partial order, then every nonempty subset must have a minimal element. (This is the definition of &quot;well-founded&quot;.) The significance of the lemma in this context is that it allows us to deduce that if there are any counterexamples to the theorem we want to prove, then there must be a minimal counterexample. If we can show the existence of the minimal counterexample implies an even smaller counterexample, we have a contradiction (since the minimal counterexample isn&#x27;t minimal) and so the set of counterexamples must be empty.

As an example of this type of argument, consider the set of all binary trees. We will show that the number of leaves in a full binary tree is one more than the number of interior nodes. Suppose there is a counterexample; then there must exist one with the minimal possible number of interior nodes. This counterexample, , has interior nodes and leaves, where . Moreover, must be nontrivial, because the trivial tree has and and is therefore not a counterexample. therefore has at least one leaf whose parent node is an interior node. Delete this leaf and its parent from the tree, promoting the leaf&#x27;s sibling node to the position formerly occupied by its parent. This reduces both and by 1, so the new tree also has and is therefore a smaller counterexample. But by hypothesis, was already the smallest counterexample; therefore, the supposition that there were any counterexamples to begin with must have been false. The partial ordering implied by &#x27;smaller&#x27; here is the one that says that whenever has fewer nodes than .

<text>Ptilodontoidea is a group of extinct mammals from the Northern Hemisphere. 
They were generally small, somewhat rodent-like creatures of the extinct order Multituberculata.

Some of these genera boast a great many species, though remains are generally sparse. 
&quot;Ptilodus&quot; is among the best known, and there&#x27;s a tendency to depict it as an analog of a squirrel.

Upper Cretaceous remains are known from North America and Europe. Later representatives (Paleocene - Eocene) hail from North America, Europe and Asia. These were some of the last multituberculates, and they are within the suborder Cimolodonta.

The superfamily is further divided into the following families:
*Neoplagiaulacidae - 10 genera; 
*Ptilodontidae - 4 genera;
*Cimolodontidae - possibly 3 genera.

The affinities of &quot;Neoliotomus&quot; are less clear, though it seems to fit somewhere within the superfamily.

<doc id="211404" wikidata="Q1369198" url="?curid=211404" title="Gerald McClellan">
<text>Gerald Allen McClellan (born October 23, 1967) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1988 to 1995. He is a two-time middleweight world champion, having held the WBO title from 1991 to 1992, and the WBC title from 1993 to 1995. McClellan was forced to retire from boxing after a severe brain injury suffered during his final fight in 1995, a loss to WBC super middleweight champion Nigel Benn.

Known for his formidable punching power and one of the highest 1st-round-knockout ratios in the history of boxing, McClellan was dubbed &quot;a miniature Mike Tyson&quot; by his promoter, Don King (Tyson himself, while incarcerated, reportedly called McClellan &quot;the best fighter in the world&quot;).) &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine rated McClellan No. 27 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Punchers Of All Time&quot;. In 2007, McClellan was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in California, not to be confused with the more widely recognized International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota.

==Amateur career==
As an amateur, McClellan was a four-time Wisconsin Golden Gloves champion, 1984–1987, competing mostly in the junior middleweight division.

He trained with Kronk Gym being trained by Emanuel Steward. After turning pro, he also fought out of a Palmer Park gym run by Sugar Ray Leonard.

==Professional career==

McClellan turned professional in 1988. Trained by hall of fame trainer Emanuel Steward, his early career was notable for a propensity for quick victories by knockout: only two of his first 29 fights went beyond the third round, although he lost both of those on the scorecard (in 6 rounds against Dennis Milton, 8 against Ralph Ward, in successive fights.) However, these proved only a momentary check on his career.

In 1991 he captured the vacant WBO middleweight title by knocking out John Mugabi in one round. A planned defence against Tyrone Trice set for July 23, 1992 didn&#x27;t happen and he spend the year in non title bouts at super middleweight before vacating the belt to get his shot at the WBC middleweight title

===Middleweight champion===

On May 8, 1993 McClellan became middleweight champion by knocking out Julian Jackson after five rounds. McClellan had survived some brutally hard punches from Jackson in the second and third rounds.

McClellan defended the WBC title three times, all first round stoppages, including a rematch with Jackson.

In the fall of 1994, McClellan separated from his long-term trainer Emanuel Steward.

===Benn vs McClellan===

McClellan moved up in weight to challenge WBC super middleweight champion Nigel Benn in London on February 25, 1995. The fight was watched by an estimated 17 million people on television and 10,300 paying spectators.

In a savage bout, McClellan knocked Benn out of the ring in round one and scored another knockdown in round eight, but each time Benn was able to work his way back into the fight. Throughout the fight Gerald received several punches to the back of the head, known to be especially dangerous, without referee interference. Referee Alfred Azaro was also roundly criticized for his officiating mistakes, which included impeding the challenger&#x27;s progress when McClellan was trying to finish off Benn in round 1. McClellan was noticeably blinking repeatedly early in round ten, during which, after receiving a single hard blow from Benn who seemed to throw his shoulder into McClellan&#x27;s eye, he voluntarily went down, taking a knee again. McClellan took the mandatory eight count and the fight was resumed, but he did not throw another punch, and moments later he dropped to his knee for a second time and allowed Azaro to count him out. After the fight was over, McClellan immediately stood up and walked to his corner under his own power. He then sat down on the canvas and leaned against the ring apron, but while being attended to by ring physicians he slumped onto his back and lost consciousness. McClellan was subsequently strapped to a stretcher and rushed to the hospital.

===Aftermath===
McClellan had emergency surgery to remove a blood clot from his brain. He spent eleven days in a coma and was found to have suffered extensive brain damage. He lost his eyesight, the ability to walk unassisted, and was reported as being 80 percent deaf. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ran an article about the fight and its outcome one week after the fight. McClellan&#x27;s family flew to London to be by his side, and he was later flown back to his home country. He has recently recovered some ability to walk with the assistance of a cane, but he has not recovered his eyesight. In addition to being blind, his short-term memory was also profoundly affected. His three sisters, particularly Lisa McClellan, are responsible for his care. In a 2011 documentary broadcast by ITV (which originally screened the fight live in the UK), Lisa stated that Gerald is in fact not deaf, but that he has trouble with comprehension when spoken to.

Tarick Salmaci, a Kronk Gym fighter, claimed later in an interview that he had sparred with McClellan over a year before the Benn fight, and that after McClellan was hit by a jab thrown by Salmaci, McClellan started to blink hard and the session had to be stopped. McClellan initially claimed that he was thumbed, but later admitted to Salmaci in the locker room that he was in fact seriously hurt. Salmaci said that he found it strange that a fighter with McClellan&#x27;s chin wearing headgear was being hurt by a jab, and that when he noticed McClellan blinking during the Benn fight in the same way, Salmaci was immediately aware that McClellan was in serious trouble. Also notable in hindsight was McClellan complaining of getting regular headaches after his first fight with Julian Jackson in May 1993. In the fight, McClellan&#x27;s chin resisted Jackson&#x27;s formidable punching power before McClellan won the fight in round 5, but Jackson&#x27;s punches may have done some damage to McClellan&#x27;s brain, such as concussions, that were not noticed at the time.

==Fundraising==
McClellan has been the honoree at numerous banquets and award ceremonies, and fellow boxing world champion Roy Jones Jr., often pointed out as a rival middleweight champion during 1993–94 (indeed, McClellan actually beat Jones as an amateur), set up a foundation to help McClellan.

Nigel Benn himself has also helped to raise funds for McClellan&#x27;s treatment, and the two men would meet again for the first time since their bout at a fundraiser held in London on February 24, 2007. Several items were auctioned off at the event and a total of £200,000 was raised.

In May 2012, the World Boxing Council publicly appealed for donations to a trust fund set up in McClellan&#x27;s name in order to help his sister Lisa maintain his 24-hour care. In July 2017, McClellan took a turn for the worse, and underwent surgery to repair a malfunctioning colon. McClellan now uses a colostomy bag, and incurs colostomy supply expenses of about 500 dollars a month. Former world light middleweight champion Terry Norris, whose Final Fight Foundation acts to protect boxers, made an appeal for the Gerald McClellan Trust, noting, &quot;McClellan&#x27;s organs are starting to shut down because of his brain injury.&quot; Ring 10, a nonprofit organization that helps impoverished former fighters, provides McClellan with monthly food credit and raises funds to assist with payment of other necessities.

==Dog fighting controversy==
According to an article in &quot;The Observer&quot;, McClellan participated in dog fighting.
McClellan&#x27;s trainer and family admitted that McClellan was involved with fighting pitbulls, and on one occasion had used tape to bind the jaws of a Labrador shut before allowing his pet pit bull &quot;Deuce&quot; to kill it.

<text>A film producer is a person who oversees film production. Either employed by a production company or working independently, producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting the script, coordinating writing, directing, editing, and arranging financing.

The producer is responsible for finding and selecting promising material for development. Unless the film is based on an existing script, the producer hires a screenwriter and oversees the script&#x27;s development. These activities culminate with the pitch, led by the producer, to secure the financial backing that enables production to begin. If all succeeds, the project is &quot;greenlit&quot;.

The producer supervises the pre-production, principal photography and post-production stages of filmmaking. A producer hires a director for the film, as well as other key crew members. Whereas the director makes the creative decisions during the production, the producer typically manages logistics and business operations, though some directors also produce their own films. The producer must ensure the film is delivered on time and within budget, and in the later stages before release, will oversee the marketing and distribution of the film.

Producers cannot always supervise all of the production. In this case, the primary producer or executive producer may hire and delegate work to associate producers, assistant producers, line producers, or unit production managers.

==Process and responsibilities==

===Development and pre-production===

During this stage of the production process, producers bring together people like the film director, cinematographer, and production designer. Unless the film is to be based on an original script, the producer must find an appropriate screenwriter. If an existing script is considered flawed, the producer can order a new version or decide to hire a script doctor. The producer also gives final approval when hiring the film director, cast members, and other staff. In some cases, producers also have the last word when it comes to casting questions. A producer will also approve locations, the studio hire, the final shooting script, the production schedule, and the budget. Spending more time and money in pre-production can reduce budget waste and delays during the production stage.

===Production===

During production, the producer&#x27;s job is to ensure the film remains on schedule and under budget. To this end, they must remain in constant contact with directors and other key creative team members.

Producers cannot always personally supervise all parts of their production but will instead delegate tasks as needed. For example, some producers run a company that also deals with film distribution. Also, the cast and film crew often work at different times and places, and certain films even require a second unit.

===Post-production===

Even after shooting for a film is complete, the producers can still demand that additional scenes be filmed. In the case of a negative test screening, producers may even demand an alternative film ending. For example, when the audience reacted negatively to Rambo&#x27;s death in the test screening of the film &quot;First Blood&quot;, the producers requested a new ending be filmed. Producers also oversee the film&#x27;s sales, marketing, and distribution rights, often working with third-party specialist firms.

==Types==
Different types of producers and their roles within the industry today include:

===Executive producer===

An executive producer oversees all other producers under a specific project and ensures that the entire project remains on track. They are also usually in charge of managing the film&#x27;s finances and all other business aspects. On a television series an executive producer is often a writer and given credit in a creative capacity. In a feature film or movie, the executive producer is often the person directly funding the project or is directly responsible for bringing in investors for funding. In television, it is becoming more and more common to split this role into two for creative projects. These are the executive producer and the showrunner. A showrunner, in this context, is the most senior creative, working on writing and producing their vision; they are effectively the same as the producer; overseeing, arranging, managing, and beginning every aspect of production. Whereas the executive producer focuses more on budgeting and predicting the views of the higher authorities in the wider company; trying to ground the showrunner&#x27;s vision to tangible limits. A co-executive producer is someone whose input is considered as valuable as that of the executive producer, despite having a junior or unofficial role.

===Line producer===

A line producer manages the staff and the day-to-day operations and oversees each physical aspect involved in making a film or television program. The line producer can be credited as &quot;produced by&quot; in certain cases.

===Supervising producer===

A supervising producer supervises the creative process of screenplay development and often aids in script rewrites. They can also fulfill the executive producer&#x27;s role of overseeing other producers.

===Producer===
Within the production process, a producer can oversee, arrange, manage, and begin every aspect of production. They are typically involved in every stage of the overall production process.

===Co-producer===
A co-producer is a member of a team of producers that perform all of the functions and roles that a single producer would in a given project.

===Coordinating producer or production coordinator===

A coordinating producer coordinates the work/role of multiple producers trying to achieve a shared result.

===Associate producer or assistant producer===
The associate or assistant producer helps the producer during the production process. They can sometimes be involved in coordinating others&#x27; jobs, such as creating peoples&#x27; schedules and hiring the main talent.

===Segment producer===
A segment producer produces one or more specific segments of a multi-segment film or television production.

===Field producer===
A field producer helps the producer by overseeing all of the production outside the studio in specific film locations.

==Labor relations==
Considered executive employees in regard to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 in the United States, producers represent the management team of production and are charged by the studios to enforce the provisions of the union contracts negotiated by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) with the below-the-line employees. Founded in 1924 by the U.S. Trade Association as the Association of Motion Picture Producers, the AMPTP was initially responsible for negotiating labor contracts. Still, during the mid-1930s, it took over all contract negotiation responsibilities previously controlled by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Today, the AMPTP negotiates with various industry associations when dealing with union contracts, including the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), the Directors Guild of America (DGA), and the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA). In 2012, the AMPTP negotiated over eighty industry-wide union agreements on behalf of 350 studios and independent production companies. Since 1982, the AMPTP has been responsible for negotiating these union agreements and is now considered the official contract negotiation representative for everyone within the film and television industry.

While individual producers are responsible for negotiating deals with the studios distributing their films, the Producers Guild of America offers guidance to protect and promote the interests of producers and the production team in film, television, and new media, offering the framework to provide health insurance and pension benefits, and assists in establishing safe working conditions and vetting the validity of screen credits.

In December 2021, global unions filed a report titled &quot;Demanding Dignity Behind the Scenes&quot; to attempt to end the &quot;long hours culture&quot; of the television and film industry, citing in part that abuses increased in 2021 as the industry attempted to recover lost time due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The unions supporting the report make up over 20 million television, film, and arts workers worldwide.

==Career process==
Many producers begin in a college, university, or film school. Film schools and many universities offer courses covering film production knowledge, with some courses specially designed for future film producers. These courses focus on key topics like pitching, script development, script assessment, shooting schedule design, and budgeting. Students can also expect practical training on post-production. Training at a top-producing school is one of the most efficient ways a student can gain industry credibility.

While education is one way to begin a career as a film producer, experience is also usually required to land a job. Internships are a way to gain experience while in school and give students a foundation to build a career. Many internships are paid, which enables students to earn money while gaining hands-on skills from industry professionals. Through internships, students can network within the film industry, which is an important way to make necessary industry connections. Once an internship is over, the next step will typically be to land a junior position, such as a production assistant.

Pay can vary based on the producer&#x27;s role and the filming location. In the United States, the salary can start between $20,000 and $70,000, even doubling when working in Los Angeles. As of 2022, the average annual salary for a producer in the U.S. is listed as $70,180 per year, with an estimated range from $43,000 to $150,000. When examining more than 15,000 producers in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the average annual salary is $138,640. Producers can also have an agreement to take a percentage of a movie&#x27;s sales.

There is no average workday for film producers since their tasks change from day to day. A producer&#x27;s work hours are often irregular and can consist of long days with the possibility of working nights and weekends.

<doc id="211406" wikidata="Q12901183" url="?curid=211406" title="Neoliotomus">
<text>Neoliotomus is a genus of North American mammal from the Paleocene. It existed in the age immediately following the extinction of the last dinosaurs and was a member of the extinct order Multituberculata. It lies within the suborder Cimolodonta and the superfamily Ptilodontoidea. Other than that, its affinities are somewhat unclear.

The genus &quot;Neoliotomus&quot; (&quot;new &quot;Liotomus&quot;&quot;) was named by Jepsen G.L. in 1930, and is also known as &quot;Eucosmodon&quot; (partly).

==Species==
The species &quot;Neoliotomus conventus&quot;, named by Jepsen G.L. in 1930, is known from the Clarkforkian (Paleocene) DeBeque Formation of Wyoming and of the Fort Union Formation of Montana and Colorado, (United States). This is a fairly large multituberculate of around 1.9 kg. The holotype is in the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University.

The species &quot;Neoliotomus ultimus&quot; was named by Granger W. and Simpson G.G. in 1928. It has also been known as &quot;Eucosmodon ultimus&quot; (Granger &amp; Simpson, 1928). Fossil remains were found in Clarkforkian (Paleocene) strata of Wyoming and Colorado. This species is known from a fair number of locations. It is another large multituberculate, which weighed perhaps 2 kg.

<text>Neoplagiaulacidae is a family of mammal within the extinct order Multituberculata. Fossil remains are known from the Upper Cretaceous through to the latest Eocene/early Oligocene. Representatives have been found in North America, Europe and Asia. They are the last multituberculates known.

Neoplagiaulacinae (Ameghino 1890) has been seen as a sub-family within Ptilodontidae (Cope, 1887). More recent thinking has it as a family. Synonyms are Ectypodidae (Sloan &amp; Van Valen 1965) and Ectypodontidae (Sloan &amp; Van Valen 1965). Most fossils are restricted to teeth. The family is part of the suborder of Cimolodonta within the superfamily of Ptilodontoidea.

<text>The Heteroptera are a group of about 40,000 species of insects in the order Hemiptera. They are sometimes called &quot;true bugs&quot;, though that name more commonly refers to the Hemiptera as a whole. &quot;Typical bugs&quot; might be used as a more unequivocal alternative, since the heteropterans are most consistently and universally termed &quot;bugs&quot; among the Hemiptera. &quot;Heteroptera&quot; is Greek for &quot;different wings&quot;: most species have forewings with both membranous and hardened portions (called hemelytra); members of the primitive sub-group Enicocephalomorpha have completely membranous wings.

The name &quot;Heteroptera&quot; is used in two very different ways in modern classifications. In Linnean nomenclature, it commonly appears as a suborder within the order Hemiptera, where it can be paraphyletic or monophyletic depending on its delimitation. In phylogenetic nomenclature, it is used as an unranked clade within the Prosorrhyncha clade, which in turn is in the Hemiptera clade. This results from the realization that the Coleorrhyncha are just &quot;living fossil&quot; relatives of the traditional Heteroptera, close enough to them to be united with that group.

The infraorders Leptopodomorpha, Gerromorpha, and Nepomorpha, comprise a significant component of the world&#x27;s aquatic and semiaquatic insects. There are 23 families, 343 genera and 4,810 species group taxa within these three infraorders. Most of the remaining groups that are common and familiar are in the Cimicomorpha and Pentatomomorpha.

==Classification==
The use of the name &quot;Heteroptera&quot; has had the rank of order, dating back to 1810 by Pierre André Latreille. Only recently has it been relegated to a subsidiary rank within a larger definition of Hemiptera, so many reference works still include it as an order. Whether to continue treating it as a suborder is still a subject of some controversy, as is whether the name itself should ever be used, although three basic approaches ranging from abolishing it entirely to maintaining the taxonomy with a slight change in systematics is proposed, two of which (but not the traditional one) agree with the phylogeny. The competing classifications call for a preference for two suborders versus one when the &quot;living fossil&quot; family Peloridiidae is taken into consideration:

In one revised classification proposed in 1995, the name of the suborder is Prosorrhyncha, and Heteroptera is a rankless subgroup within it. The only difference between Heteroptera and Prosorrhyncha is that the latter includes the family Peloridiidae, which is a tiny relictual group that is in its own monotypic superfamily and infraorder. In other words, the Heteroptera and Prosorrhyncha &quot;sensu&quot; Sorensen et al. are identical except that Prosorrhyncha contains one additional infraorder, called Peloridiomorpha (comprising only 13 small genera). The ongoing conflict between traditional, Linnaean classifications and nontraditional classifications is exemplified by the problem inherent in continued usage of the name Heteroptera when it no longer can be matched to any standard Linnaean rank (as it falls below suborder but above infraorder). If this classification succeeds, then the &quot;Heteroptera&quot; grouping may be discarded, but in that case it is likely that no ranks will be used at all according to the standards of phylogenetic nomenclature.

In the traditional classification, the Peloridiidae are retained as their own suborder, called Coleorrhyncha; &quot;Heteroptera&quot; is treated the same. Functionally, the only difference between this classification and the preceding is that the former uses the name Prosorrhyncha to refer to a particular clade, while the traditional approach divides this into the paraphyletic Heteroptera and the monophyletic Coleorrhyncha. Many believe it is preferable to use only one name because the characteristics of the two traditional suborders are too closely related to be treated as separate.

Alternatively, the modified approach of placing Coleorrhyncha &#x27;within&#x27; the Heteroptera can be used. Indeed, as that solution preserves the well-known Heteroptera at the taxonomic rank they traditionally hold while making them a good monophyletic group, it seems preferable to the paraphyletic &quot;Heteroptera&quot; used in older works. In that case, the &quot;core&quot; Heteroptera could be considered a section – as yet unnamed, mainly because the Prosorrhyncha were proposed earlier – within the &quot;expanded&quot; Heteroptera, or the latter could simply be described as consisting of a basal &quot;living fossil&quot; lineage and a more apomorphic main radiation. Whether the name &quot;Coleorrhyncha&quot; is to be retained for the basal lineage or whether the more consistent &quot;Peloridiomorpha&quot; is used instead is a matter of taste, as described below.

Separate from the question of the actual &quot;closeness&quot; of Heteroptera and Coleorrhyncha is the potential disruption to traditional construction of names; there seems to be reluctance among hemipterists to abandon the use of &quot;Heteroptera&quot;. This can be seen by the name itself, as it is a violation of convention to use the ending &quot;-ptera&quot; for any rank above genus other than an order – though since it is a convention rather than a mandatory rule of Linnean nomenclature, taxonomists are technically free to violate it (which is why, for example, not all insect orders end in &quot;-ptera&quot;, e.g., Odonata). However, in most cases when such conventions are violated, it does not create an internal conflict as in the present case (that is, the order Hemiptera has a suborder named Heteroptera, which is an internal conflict). At least some hemipterists argue that the name Heteroptera should be dropped entirely to eliminate this internal conflict, though the third possibility offers a workaround. In that case, to achieve full consistency of names &quot;Coleorrhyncha&quot; would probably be dropped in favor of &quot;Peloridiomorpha&quot;.

<text>Neoplagiaulax is a mammal genus from the Paleocene of Europe and North America. In the case of the latter continent, there may possibly be some slightly earlier, Upper Cretaceous material too. It existed in the age immediately following the extinction of the last dinosaurs. This animal was a member of the extinct order Multituberculata, lying within the suborder Cimolodonta and family Neoplagiaulacidae.

The genus &quot;Neoplagiaulax&quot; (&quot;new &quot;Plagiaulax&quot;&quot;) was named by Lemoine V. in 1882.

<doc id="211426" wikidata="Q26214" url="?curid=211426" title="Gnathostomata">
<text>Gnathostomata (; from Ancient Greek: (&#x27;) &#x27;jaw&#x27; + (&#x27;) &#x27;mouth&#x27;) are the jawed vertebrates. Gnathostome diversity comprises roughly 60,000 species, which accounts for 99% of all living vertebrates, including humans. Most gnathostomes have retained ancestral traits like true teeth, a stomach, and paired appendages (pectoral and pelvic fins, arms, legs, wings, etc.). Other traits are elastin, a horizontal semicircular canal of the inner ear, myelin sheaths of neurons, and an adaptive immune system which has discrete lymphoid organs (spleen and thymus), and uses V(D)J recombination to create antigen recognition sites, rather than using genetic recombination in the variable lymphocyte receptor gene.

It is now assumed that Gnathostomata evolved from ancestors that already possessed a pair of both pectoral and pelvic fins. Until recently these ancestors, known as antiarchs, were thought to have lacked pectoral or pelvic fins. In addition to this, some placoderms (extinct fish with bony plates) were shown to have a third pair of paired appendages, that had been modified to claspers in males and basal plates in females—a pattern not seen in any other vertebrate group.

The Osteostraci (bony armored &quot;jawless&quot; fish) are generally considered the sister taxon of Gnathostomata.

Jaw development in vertebrates is likely a product of the supporting gill arches. This development would help push water into the mouth by the movement of the jaw, so that it would pass over the gills for gas exchange. The repetitive use of the newly formed jaw bones would eventually lead to the ability to bite in some gnathostomes.

Newer research suggests that a branch of placoderms was most likely the ancestor of present-day gnathostomes. A 419-million-year-old fossil of a placoderm named &quot;Entelognathus&quot; had a bony skeleton and anatomical details associated with cartilaginous and bony fish, demonstrating that the absence of a bony skeleton in Chondrichthyes is a derived trait. The fossil findings of primitive bony fishes such as &quot;Guiyu oneiros&quot; and &quot;Psarolepis&quot;, which lived contemporaneously with &quot;Entelognathus&quot; and had pelvic girdles more in common with placoderms than with other bony fish, show that it was a relative rather than a direct ancestor of the extant gnathostomes. It also indicates that spiny sharks and Chondrichthyes represent a single sister group to the bony fishes. Fossil findings of juvenile placoderms, which had true teeth that grew on the surface of the jawbone and had no roots, making them impossible to replace or regrow as they broke or wore down as they grew older, proves the common ancestor of all gnathostomes had teeth and place the origin of teeth along with, or soon after, the evolution of jaws.

Late Ordovician-aged microfossils of what have been identified as scales of either acanthodians or &quot;shark-like fishes&quot;, may mark Gnathostomata&#x27;s first appearance in the fossil record. Undeniably unambiguous gnathostome fossils, mostly of primitive acanthodians, begin appearing by the early Silurian, and become abundant by the start of the Devonian.

==Classification==
Gnathostomata is traditionally an infraphylum, broken into three top-level groupings: Chondrichthyes, or the cartilaginous fish; Placodermi, an extinct grade of armored fish; and Teleostomi, which includes the familiar classes of bony fish, birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Some classification systems have used the term Amphirhina. It is a sister group of the jawless craniates Agnatha.



== Evolution ==

The appearance of the early vertebrate jaw has been described as &quot;a crucial innovation&quot; and &quot;perhaps the most profound and radical evolutionary step in the vertebrate history&quot;. Fish without jaws had more difficulty surviving than fish with jaws, and most jawless fish became extinct during the Triassic period. However studies of the cyclostomes, the jawless hagfishes and lampreys that did survive, have yielded little insight into the deep remodelling of the vertebrate skull that must have taken place as early jaws evolved.

The ancestor of all jawed vertebrates have gone through two rounds of whole genome duplication. The first happened before the gnathostome and cyclostome split, and appears to have been an autopolyploidy event (happened within the same species). The second occurred after the split, and was an allopolyploidy event (the result of hybridization between two lineages).

The customary view is that jaws are homologous to the gill arches. In jawless fishes a series of gills opened behind the mouth, and these gills became supported by cartilaginous elements. The first set of these elements surrounded the mouth to form the jaw. The upper portion of the second embryonic arch supporting the gill became the hyomandibular bone of jawed fish, which supports the skull and therefore links the jaw to the cranium. The hyomandibula is a set of bones found in the hyoid region in most fishes. It usually plays a role in suspending the jaws or the operculum in the case of teleosts.

While potentially older Ordovician records are known, the oldest unambigious evidence of jawed vertebrates are &quot;Qianodus&quot; and &quot;Fanjingshania&quot; from the early Silurian (Aeronian) of Guizhou, China around 439 million years ago, which are placed as acanthodian-grade stem-chondrichthyans.

<text>Sexual attraction is attraction on the basis of sexual desire or the quality of arousing such interest. Sexual attractiveness or sex appeal is an individual&#x27;s ability to attract other people sexually, and is a factor in sexual selection or mate choice. The attraction can be to the physical or other qualities or traits of a person, or to such qualities in the context where they appear. The attraction may be to a person&#x27;s aesthetics, movements, voice, among other things. The attraction may be enhanced by a person&#x27;s body odor, sex pheromones, adornments, clothing, perfume or hair style. It can be influenced by individual genetic, psychological, or cultural factors, or to other, more amorphous qualities. Sexual attraction is also a response to another person that depends on a combination of the person possessing the traits and on the criteria of the person who is attracted.

Though attempts have been made to devise objective criteria of sexual attractiveness and measure it as one of several bodily forms of capital asset (e.g. erotic capital), a person&#x27;s sexual attractiveness is to a large extent a subjective measure dependent on another person&#x27;s interest, perception, and sexual orientation. For example, a gay or lesbian person would typically find a person of the same sex to be more attractive than one of the other sex. A bisexual person would find either sex to be attractive. Asexuality refers to those who do not experience sexual attraction for either sex, though they may have romantic attraction or a non-directed libido. Interpersonal attraction includes factors such as physical or psychological similarity, familiarity or possessing a preponderance of common or familiar features, similarity, complementarity, reciprocal liking, and reinforcement.

The ability of a person&#x27;s physical and other qualities to create a sexual interest in others is the basis of their use in advertising, film, and other visual media, as well as in modeling and other occupations. In evolutionary terms, the ovulatory shift hypothesis posits that female humans exhibit different sexual behaviours and desires at points in their menstrual cycle, as a means to ensure that they attract a high quality mate to copulate with during their most fertile time. Hormone levels throughout the menstrual cycle affect a woman&#x27;s overt behaviours, influencing the way a woman presents herself to others during stages of her menstrual cycle, in an attempt to attract high quality mates the closer the woman is to ovulation.

==Social and biological factors==
Human sexuality has many aspects. In biology, sexuality describes the reproductive mechanism and the basic biological drive that exists in all sexually reproducing species and can encompass sexual intercourse and sexual contact in all its forms. There are also emotional and physical aspects of sexuality. These relate to the bond between individuals, which may be expressed through profound feelings or emotions. Sociologically, it can cover the cultural, political, and legal aspects; philosophically, it can span the moral, ethical, theological, spiritual, and religious aspects.

Which aspects of a person&#x27;s sexuality attract another is influenced by cultural factors; it has varied over time, as well as personal factors. Influencing factors may be determined more locally among sub-cultures, across sexual fields, or simply by the preferences of the individual. These preferences come about as a result of a complex variety of genetic, psychological, and cultural factors.

A person&#x27;s physical appearance has a critical impact on their sexual attractiveness. This involves the impact one&#x27;s appearance has on the senses, especially in the beginning of a relationship, among them:

* Visual perception (the symmetry of the face, physical attractiveness, health, and how they act or move, for example, while dancing);
* Audition (how the other&#x27;s voice and movements sound);
* Olfaction (how the other smells, naturally or artificially; the wrong smell may be repellent);
* Somatosensory system (for example touch and temperature).

As with other animals, pheromones may have an impact, though less significantly in the case of humans. Theoretically, the &quot;wrong&quot; pheromone may cause someone to be disliked, even when they would otherwise appear attractive. Frequently, a pleasant-smelling perfume is used to encourage the other person to more deeply inhale the air surrounding its wearer, increasing the probability that the individual&#x27;s pheromones will be inhaled. The importance of pheromones in human relationships is probably limited and is widely disputed, although it appears to have some scientific basis.

Some people exhibit high levels of sexual fetishism and are sexually stimulated by other stimuli not normally associated with sexual arousal. The degree to which such fetishism exists or has existed in different cultures is controversial.

Pheromones have been determined to play a role in sexual attraction between people. They influence gonadal hormone secretion, for example, follicle maturation in the ovaries in females and testosterone and sperm production in males.

==High anxiety==

Research conducted by Donald G. Dutton and Arthur P. Aron in the 1970s aimed to find the relation between sexual attraction and high anxiety conditions. In doing so, 85 male participants were contacted by an attractive female interviewer at either a fear-arousing suspension bridge or a normal bridge. Conclusively, it was shown that the male participants who were asked by the female interviewer to perform the thematic apperception test (TAT) on the fear-arousing bridge, wrote more sexual content in the stories and attempted, with greater effort, to contact the interviewer after the experiment than those participants who performed the TAT on the normal bridge. In another test, a male participant, chosen from a group of 80, was given anticipated shocks. With him was an attractive female confederate, who was also being shocked. The experiment showed that the male&#x27;s sexual imagery in the TAT was much higher when self shock was anticipated and not when the female confederate shock was anticipated.

== Enhancement ==
People consciously or subconsciously enhance their sexual attractiveness or sex appeal for a number of reasons. It may be to attract someone with whom they can form a deeper relationship, for companionship, procreation, or an intimate relationship, besides other possible purposes. It can be part of a courtship process. This can involve physical aspects or interactive processes whereby people find and attract potential partners, and maintain a relationship. These processes, which involve attracting a partner and maintaining sexual interest, can include flirting, which can be used to attract the sexual attention of another to encourage romance or sexual relations, and can involve body language, conversation, joking, or brief physical contact.

== Sex and sexuality differences ==
Men have been found to have a greater interest in uncommitted sex compared to women. Some research shows this interest to be more sociological than biological. Men have a greater interest in visual sexual stimuli than women. However, additional trends have been found with a greater sensitivity to partner status in women choosing a sexual partner and men placing a greater emphasis on physical attractiveness in a potential mate, as well as a significantly greater tendency toward sexual jealousy in men and emotional jealousy in women.

Bailey, Gaulin, Agyei, and Gladue (1994) analyzed whether these results varied according to sexual orientation. In general, they found biological sex played a bigger role in the psychology of sexual attraction than orientation. However, there were some differences between homosexual and heterosexual women and men on these factors. While gay and straight men showed similar psychological interest in casual sex on markers of sociosexuality, gay men showed a larger number of partners in behaviour expressing this interest (proposed to be due to a difference in opportunity). Self-identified lesbian women showed a significantly greater interest in visual sexual stimuli than heterosexual women and judged partner status to be less important in romantic partnerships. Heterosexual men had a significantly greater preference for younger partners than homosexual men. People who identify as asexual may not be sexually attracted to anyone. Gray asexuality includes those who only experience sexual attraction under certain circumstances; for example, exclusively after an emotional bond has been formed. This tends to vary from person to person.

== Sexual preferences and hormones ==
The ovulatory shift hypothesis is the theory that female humans tend to exhibit different sexual behaviours and desires at points in their cycle. Two meta-analyses published in 2014 reached opposing conclusions on whether the existing evidence was robust enough to support the prediction that women&#x27;s mate preferences change across the cycle. A newer 2018 review does not show women changing the type of men they desire at different times in their fertility cycle.

In males, a masculine face has been positively correlated with fewer respiratory diseases and, as a consequence, masculine features offer a marker of health and reproductive success.

===Ovulation and ornamentation===

Hormone levels throughout the menstrual cycle affect a woman&#x27;s behaviour in preferences and in their overt behaviours. The ornamentation effect is a phenomenon influenced by a stage of the menstrual cycle which refers to the way a woman presents herself to others, in a way to attract potential sexual partners. Studies have found that the closer women were to ovulation, the more provocatively they dress and the more attractive they are rated.

It is possible that women are sensitive to the changes in their physical attractiveness throughout their cycles, such that at their most fertile stages their levels of attractiveness are increased. Consequently, they choose to display their increased levels of attractiveness through this method of ornamentation.

During periods of hormonal imbalance, women exhibit a peak in sexual activity. As these findings have been recorded for female-initiated sexual activity and not for male-initiated activity, the causation appears to be hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle. 

Research has also found that menstrual cycles affect sexual behaviour frequency in pre-menopausal women. For example, women who had weekly sexual intercourse with men had menstrual cycles with the average duration of 29 days, while women with less frequent sexual interactions tended to have more extreme cycle lengths.

===Male response to ovulation===
Changes in hormones during a female&#x27;s cycles affect the way she behaves and the way males behave towards her. Research has found that men are a lot more attentive and loving towards their partners when they are in the most fertile phase of their cycles, in comparison to when they are in the luteal phases. Men become increasingly jealous and possessive over their partners during this stage.

<text>The prime minister of Thailand (; ; , literally &#x27;chief minister of state&#x27;) is the head of government of Thailand. The prime minister is also the chairman of the cabinet of Thailand and represents the government at home and the country abroad.

The post of prime minister has existed since the Siamese revolution of 1932 and Siam&#x27;s first constitution. Throughout the post&#x27;s existence, it has mostly been occupied by military leaders from the Royal Thai Army, three holding the rank of field marshal and seven the rank of general. 

The current prime minister is Paetongtarn Shinawatra, leader of the Pheu Thai Party, who assumed the office on 16 August 2024. A member of the Shinawatra political family, she is the youngest person and the second woman to hold the office.

&quot;Note:&quot; The list includes leaders of military juntas and acting prime ministers. However, they are not counted in the official list as provided by the Royal Thai Government.

<doc id="211439" wikidata="Q81716" url="?curid=211439" title="Charles-Augustin de Coulomb">
<text>Charles-Augustin de Coulomb ( ; ; 14 June 1736 – 23 August 1806) was a French officer, engineer, and physicist. He is best known as the eponymous discoverer of what is now called Coulomb&#x27;s law, the description of the electrostatic force of attraction and repulsion. He also did important work on friction, and his work on earth pressure formed the basis for the later development of much of the science of soil mechanics.

The SI unit of electric charge, the coulomb, was named in his honor in 1880.

== Life ==
Charles-Augustin de Coulomb was born in Angoulême, Angoumois county, France, to Henry Coulomb, an inspector of the royal demesne originally from Montpellier, and Catherine Bajet. He was baptised at the parish church of St. André. 
The family moved to Paris early in his childhood, and he studied at Collège Mazarin.
His studies included philosophy, language and literature. He also received a good education in mathematics, astronomy, chemistry and botany.
When his father suffered a financial setback, he was forced to leave Paris, and went to Montpellier. Coulomb submitted his first publication to the Society of Sciences in Montpellier during this time. He went back to Paris and passed the exams for the École royale du génie de Mézières in 1760.

He graduated in 1761 and joined the French army as an engineer with the rank of lieutenant.
Over the next twenty years, he was posted to a variety of locations where he was involved in engineering: structural, fortifications, soil mechanics, as well as other fields of engineering. His first posting was to Brest but in February 1764 he was sent to Martinique, in the West Indies, where he was put in charge of building the new Fort Bourbon and this task occupied him until June 1772. His health suffered setbacks during the three years he spent in Martinique that would affect him for the rest of his life.

On his return to France, Coulomb was sent to Bouchain. He began to write important works on applied mechanics and he presented his first work to the Académie des Sciences in Paris in 1773. In 1779 Coulomb was sent to Rochefort to collaborate with the Marquis de Montalembert in constructing a fort made entirely from wood near Île-d&#x27;Aix. During his period at Rochefort, Coulomb carried on his research into mechanics, in particular using the shipyards in Rochefort as laboratories for his experiments. Also in 1779 he published an important investigation of the laws of friction (), which was followed twenty years later by a memoir on fluid resistance.

Upon his return to France, with the rank of captain, he was employed at La Rochelle, the Isle of Aix and Cherbourg. He discovered first an inverse relationship of the force between electric charges and the square of its distance and then the same relationship between magnetic poles. Later these relationships were named after him as Coulomb&#x27;s law.

In 1781, he was stationed at Paris. In 1787 with Tenon he visited the Royal Naval Hospital, Stonehouse and they were impressed by the revolutionary &quot;pavilion&quot; design and recommended it to the French government. On the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, he resigned his appointment as &quot;intendant des eaux et fontaines&quot; and retired to a small estate which he possessed at Blois.

He was recalled to Paris for a time in order to take part in the new determination of weights and measures, which had been decreed by the Revolutionary government. He became one of the first members of the French National Institute and was appointed inspector of public instruction in 1802. His health was already very feeble and four years later he died in Paris.

Coulomb leaves a legacy as a pioneer in the field of geotechnical engineering for his contribution to retaining wall design. His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

==Research==
In 1784, his memoir &quot;Recherches théoriques et expérimentales sur la force de torsion et sur l&#x27;élasticité des fils de metal&quot; (Theoretical research and experimentation on torsion and the elasticity of metal wire) appeared. This memoir contained the results of Coulomb&#x27;s experiments on the torsional force for metal wires, specifically within a torsion balance. His general result is:


In 1785, Coulomb presented his first three reports on electricity and magnetism:

* &quot;Premier Mémoire sur l’Électricité et le Magnétisme&quot;. In this publication, Coulomb describes &quot;How to construct and use an electric balance (torsion balance) based on the property of the metal wires of having a reaction torsion force proportional to the torsion angle.&quot; Coulomb also experimentally determined the law that explains how &quot;two bodies electrified of the same kind of Electricity exert on each other.&quot; On page 574 he states:
* &quot;Second Mémoire sur l’Électricité et le Magnétisme&quot;. In this publication, Coulomb carries out the &quot;determination according to which laws both the Magnetic and the Electric fluids act, either by repulsion or by attraction.&quot; On page 579, he states that the attractive force between two oppositely charged spheres is proportional to the product of the quantities of charge on the spheres and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the spheres.
* &quot;Troisième Mémoire sur l’Électricité et le Magnétisme&quot;. &quot;On the quantity of Electricity that an isolated body loses in a certain time period, either by contact with less humid air or in the supports more or less idio-electric.&quot;

Four subsequent reports were published in the following years:

* &quot;Quatrième Mémoire&quot; &quot;Where two principal properties of the electric fluid are demonstrated: first, that this fluid does not expand into any object according to a chemical affinity or by an elective attraction, but that it divides itself between different objects brought into contact; second, that in conducting objects, the fluid, having achieved a state of stability, expands on the surface of the body and does not penetrate into the interior.&quot; (1786)
* &quot;Cinquième Mémoire&quot; &quot;On the manner in which the electric fluid divides itself between conducting objects brought into contact and the distribution of this fluid on the different parts of the surface of this object.&quot; (1787)
* &quot;Sixième Mémoire&quot; &quot;Continuation of research into the distribution of the electric fluid between several conductors. Determination of electric density at different points on the surface of these bodies.&quot; (1788)
* &quot;Septième Mémoire&quot; &quot;On magnetism&quot; (1789)

Coulomb explained the laws of attraction and repulsion between electric charges and magnetic poles, although he did not find any relationship between the two phenomena. He thought that the attraction and repulsion were due to different kinds of fluids.

Coulomb also made a significant contribution to the field of tribology. The findings of Guillaume Amontons and Coulomb are well known as Amontons-Coulomb laws of friction. He completed the most comprehensive study of friction undertaken in the eighteenth century and was named by Duncan Dowson as one of the 23 &quot;Men of Tribology&quot;.

== Contributions to earth pressure theory ==
Coulomb made groundbreaking contributions to the understanding of earth pressure, which have become foundational in geotechnical engineering. In 1776, he presented &quot;Essai sur une application des règles de Maximis et Minimis à quelques Problèmes de Statique, relatifs à l’Architecture&quot;, to the Académie des Sciences. This work introduced what is now known as the wedge theory of earth pressure and established several key principles for analyzing the stability of soil masses, including:

* Shear resistance law: Coulomb formulated the shear resistance of soils as formula_1, where formula_2 represents cohesion, formula_3 is normal stress, and formula_4 is the angle of internal friction.
* Active and passive earth pressure: He introduced the concepts of active and passive earth pressure limits, which describe the conditions under which soil exerts pressure on a retaining structure or resists movement.
* Failure planes: Coulomb determined that the failure plane in soils occurs at an angle of formula_5 to the horizontal.
* Wall friction: He was among the first to consider the effects of wall-soil friction in reducing lateral earth pressure.
* Critical height: Coulomb provided a method to calculate the critical height of vertical soil banks that could remain stable due to cohesion.
* Drainage: He emphasised the role of proper drainage in preventing additional forces from acting on retaining structures due to water accumulation.
* Empirical validation: Coulomb validated his theories using contemporary construction practices, such as those employed in the retaining walls of Marshal Vauban.

Coulomb&#x27;s analysis went beyond the practical engineering solutions of his time by systematically applying principles of statics and mechanics to problems of soil stability. His methods, although refined by later researchers, laid the groundwork for modern soil mechanics and retaining wall design, and remain relevant in geotechnical engineering. His contributions not only advanced the theory of soil mechanics but also influenced subsequent works, including those of Rankine, who further refined the theories for cohesive and granular soils. The colophon used in Coulomb&#x27;s 1776 paper is reproduced on the cover of each edition of the peer-reviewed geotechnical engineering journal Géotechnique.

<text>Colonel Thomas Pride (died 23 October 1658) was an English army officer who fought on the Parliamentarian side during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. He is best known for being one of the regicides of Charles I and the instigator of Pride&#x27;s Purge.

==Personal details==
Thomas Pride was born in Ashcott, Somerset, son of William Pride, a local tradesman. His exact date of birth is unknown but he was apprenticed to a City of London merchant in January 1622 and since the normal age for this was between 14 and 17 years old, he was probably born between 1606 and 1608.

Shortly after his seven-year apprenticeship finished in 1629, he married Elizabeth Tomson, daughter of another London merchant. His 1658 will made bequests to four sons, Thomas, Joseph, William and Samuel, and a daughter, Elizabeth.

==Career==
Pride went into business for himself as a brewer and by the early 1640s owned two brewhouses in Surrey and possibly one in Edinburgh. He was also an ensign in the London Trained bands and when the First English Civil War began in August 1642, he served as a captain in the New Model Army under Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, and was eventually promoted to the rank of colonel. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Preston in 1648 and with his regiment took part in the military occupation of London in December 1648, which was the first step towards bringing King Charles I to trial.

==Trial of King Charles I==
The next step was the expulsion of the Presbyterian and Royalist elements in the House of Commons, who were thought to be prepared to reach a settlement with Charles. This action was resolved by the army council and ordered by the lord general, Fairfax, and was carried out by Colonel Pride&#x27;s regiment. Taking his stand at the entrance of the House of Commons with a written list in his hand, he caused the arrest or exclusion of the members, who were pointed out to him. After about a hundred members had been thus dealt with, the reduced House of Commons, now reduced to about eighty in number, proceeded to bring the king to trial. This marked the end of the Long Parliament and the beginning of the Rump Parliament.

Pride was one of the trial judges and one of the regicides of King Charles I, having signed and sealed the king&#x27;s death warrant. His coat of arms appears on his seal.

==Subsequent career==
Pride commanded an infantry brigade under Oliver Cromwell at the Battle of Dunbar (1650) and at the Battle of Worcester (1651). He purchased the estate of Nonsuch Palace in Surrey, and in 1655 was appointed Sheriff of Surrey.

==Retirement and knighthood==
When the Commonwealth of England was established he abandoned his involvement in politics, except in opposing the proposal to confer the kingly dignity on Cromwell. In 1656 he was knighted by Cromwell, then Lord Protector, and was appointed to the second house added to Parliament as a result of the Humble Petition and Advice.

==Marriage==
He married Elizabeth Monk (born 1628), a daughter of Thomas Monk of Potheridge in Devon by his wife Mary Gould, a daughter of William Gould of Hayes. Elizabeth&#x27;s uncle was the royalist general George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle (1608–1670), KG, the key figure in effecting the Restoration of the Monarchy to King Charles II in 1660.

==Death==
Pride died in 1658 at his home of Worcester Park House, having bought it and the &quot;Great Park&quot; of Nonsuch Palace, Surrey. After the Restoration of 1660 his body was ordered dug up and suspended on the gallows at Tyburn along with those of Cromwell, Henry Ireton and John Bradshaw, though it is said that the sentence was not carried out, probably because his corpse was too far decayed.

<text>The SDP–Liberal Alliance was a centrist and social liberal political and electoral alliance in the United Kingdom.

Formed by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Liberal Party, the SDP–Liberal Alliance was established in 1981, contesting the 1982 United Kingdom local elections, 1983 United Kingdom local elections, 1983 general election, 1984 United Kingdom local elections, 1984 European election, 1985 United Kingdom local elections, 1986 United Kingdom local elections, 1987 United Kingdom local elections and 1987 general election.

The SDP–Liberal Alliance ceased to exist in 1988, when the two component parties merged to form the Social and Liberal Democrats, under which label they stood in the 1988 United Kingdom local elections, later renamed the Liberal Democrats.

== History ==
Following the establishment of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) by the &#x27;Gang of Four&#x27; (Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers, Shirley Williams), who had left the Labour Party in March 1981, the SDP entered into an informal alliance with the Liberal Party, led by David Steel. The SDP fought its first by-election, in Warrington, with future leader Roy Jenkins standing as &quot;SDP with Liberal support&quot;.

On 16 June 1981, this arrangement was formalised into an alliance, with both parties agreeing to stand down in each other&#x27;s favour and govern as a coalition government if the two parties ever won enough seats between them for a majority. Between 1981 and 1983, the parties together won seats in by-elections in:
* Croydon North West (Bill Pitt, a Liberal),
* Crosby (Shirley Williams of the SDP),
* Glasgow Hillhead (Roy Jenkins of the SDP), and
* Bermondsey (Simon Hughes of the Liberals, with the largest swing ever recorded in any British election).

The formation of the SDP and the subsequent alliance came at a time when the British economy was in a deep recession and Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative government was proving unpopular; since coming to power in May 1979, unemployment had risen from over 1,500,000 to 3,000,000 and beyond by 1982, driven mainly by a sharp contraction in the manufacturing sector. In 1981, there were riots in London&#x27;s Brixton, Birmingham&#x27;s Handsworth, Leeds&#x27; Chapeltown, Liverpool&#x27;s Toxteth and Manchester&#x27;s Moss Side.

Meanwhile, Labour had shifted dramatically to the left since the election in 1980 of Michael Foot as party leader. As much distaste as some voters had for Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative government, many people were just as opposed to the prospect of Foot as Prime Minister. Many also viewed Tony Benn negatively. Having moved over to the hard left, he had been given the position of Shadow Minister without Portfolio which freed him up from formal ministerial obligations while still affording him high status. His public appearances at events organised by Militant, a far-left entryist group, alienated key Labour figures.

As part of the Alliance, Steel agreed to serve in the coalition government under the SDP leader as prime minister. With an election not due until May 1984, the Alliance proved to be an instant hit with voters who were disgruntled with the Conservatives and Labour, as many opinion polls in late 1981 and early 1982 showed the Alliance leading opinion polling by a wide margin, peaking with a 50% showing – up to twice the level of support shown for the Conservatives around this time. Steel was so certain that the Liberals would be part of a government for the first time in over half a century that when he addressed the 1981 Liberal Party conference, he famously declared, &quot;Go back to your constituencies, and prepare for government!&quot;

However, a series of events followed which saw the political tables turn. Argentine forces invaded the British dependent territory of the Falkland Islands on 2 April 1982. A Security Council Resolution 502 was passed the next day demanding an immediate Argentine withdrawal, which was ignored, so Thatcher sent out a task force to recapture the islands—by military means, if necessary. The UK won the conflict on 14 June, and subsequent opinion polls showed the Conservatives firmly in the lead. With a general election due by May 1984, it seemed that the most anticipated outcome would be whether the Alliance or Labour formed the next opposition. A Conservative re-election was looking even more likely as 1982 drew to a close, as the recession came to an end and inflation had been cut to 4% from a massive 27% within four years, although unemployment remained above 3,000,000. She felt confident enough to hold an election in June 1983 – a year earlier than necessary.

The Alliance exploited the nation&#x27;s mass unemployment in the run-up to the election, running a &quot;Working Together for Britain&quot; campaign which it promised would see unemployment reduced by up to 1,000,000.

=== 1983 general election and aftermath ===

The Alliance won 25.4% of the national vote in the 1983 general election, compared to Labour&#x27;s 27.6%. However, a mere 23 Alliance Members of Parliament (MPs) were elected (17 of whom were Liberal), compared to Labour&#x27;s 209. The SDP came second in many constituencies, including nearly 70% of the Conservative-won seats, though the bulk of Labour&#x27;s defectors to the SDP in 1981 lost their seats. Due to the first past the post electoral system, this success did not translate into parliamentary seats. The SDP&#x27;s support was spread out across the country, and was not concentrated in enough areas to win more seats. The split in the centre-left vote is claimed to have helped the Conservatives to win the election by a landslide.

Both the SDP and the Liberals were committed to proportional representation, under which system they would have elected more MPs to the House of Commons.

The Alliance came under heavy criticism from Foot in the aftermath of the 1983 election; he condemned them for &quot;siphoning&quot; support away from the Labour Party and enabling the Conservatives to win more seats.

The 1983 election had given the Conservatives a triple-digit majority, but within months a strong challenge to their power – and to the challenge posed by the Alliance – was showing as Foot stood down in favour of Neil Kinnock, who immediately reversed the party&#x27;s hard-left turn. This resulted in a dramatic rise in Labour fortunes in the opinion polls – some of which showed them ahead of the Conservatives and the Alliance by March 1984. However, at least one opinion poll showed the Alliance ahead of the Conservatives and Labour as late as September 1985. By this stage, the recession had ended three years earlier and the battle against inflation had clearly been won; however unemployment – seen as a major factor in a string of inner city riots that autumn – was still above 3,000,000. With the economy further improving over the next 18 months and unemployment finally starting to fall, however, Thatcher felt confident to call a general election for 11 June 1987 – although the deadline for the election was 12 months later.

=== 1987 general election and aftermath ===
The Alliance failed to maintain momentum. In the 1987 general election, each party&#x27;s vote share fell slightly; the Liberals won 17 seats (the same as in 1983), while the SDP won five (one fewer than four years previously), while Labour were firmly established as Britain&#x27;s second major political party with a much stronger showing than in 1983, although the Conservatives still achieved a third successive election win with Thatcher still at the helm.

=== 1988 merger ===
By 1987, relations had become fraught. Despite this, Steel proposed a merger of the two parties following the 1987 general election. The majority of members of both parties agreed, and a merger was effected early in 1988. The new party was named the Social and Liberal Democrats, shortened in October 1989 to the Liberal Democrats.

=== Remaining factions ===
Small factions of both parties continued under the names of the SDP and the Liberal Party but, as each was made up of those members who least trusted the other party, there was no chance that the two &#x27;continuing&#x27; parties would co-operate.

The SDP was re-established under the leadership of one of the founders of the SDP, David Owen, who had objected to the merger of the two parties. Owen and the party&#x27;s national executive dissolved the party in 1990, but another group of party members continue the party under the SDP name.

The Liberal Party was re-established under the leadership of Michael Meadowcroft and continues to operate. However, many members of this continuity party, including Meadowcroft himself, have since joined the mainstream Liberal Democrats.

<doc id="211447" wikidata="Q3718911" url="?curid=211447" title="Richard Herring">
<text>Richard Keith Herring (born 12 July 1967) is an English stand-up comedian and writer whose early work includes the comedy double act Lee and Herring (alongside Stewart Lee). He is described by &quot;The British Theatre Guide&quot; as &quot;one of the leading hidden masters of modern British comedy&quot;.

Towards the end of the double act, Herring also worked as a writer, producing four plays. After Lee and Herring went their separate ways he co-wrote the sitcom &quot;Time Gentlemen Please&quot;, but quickly returned to performance with concept-driven one-person shows like &quot;Talking Cock&quot;, &quot;Hitler Moustache&quot; and &quot;Christ on a Bike&quot; as well as regular circuit stand-up. Herring has created fourteen of these stand-up shows since 2001, performing them for eleven consecutive years from 2004 to 2014 at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, with annual tours and a final performance recorded for DVD. His 2016–17 show was a &#x27;best of&#x27; tour, drawing from these shows.

Herring is recognised as a pioneer of comedy podcasting, initially with broadcaster Andrew Collins on &quot;The Collings and Herrin Podcast&quot; and subsequently with high-profile comedians and celebrities such as Dawn French, Michael Palin and Stephen Fry on &quot;Richard Herring&#x27;s Leicester Square Theatre Podcast&quot;. He has maintained a daily blog called &quot;Warming Up&quot; without a break since 25 November 2002. His blog is archived by the British Library for purposes of UK documentary heritage.
In September 2024 he started publishing the blog (and other material) on Substack where he has 9000+ subscribers.

== Early life ==
Richard Herring was born in Pocklington, East Riding of Yorkshire, and grew up in Cheddar, Somerset. He is the youngest of three children. He attended The Kings of Wessex School, where his father was the headmaster and maths teacher. This later formed the basis of his 2008 stand-up show, &quot;The Headmaster&#x27;s Son&quot;. Herring’s mother was also a teacher. The 2007 ITV comedy drama &quot;You Can Choose Your Friends&quot;, which he wrote and also starred in, was based on his family. Some of the same characters later featured in the Radio 4 series &quot;Relativity&quot;.

Herring was a student at St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he wrote and performed for a comedy troupe known as the Seven Raymonds as well as the Oxford Revue. He attained a 2:1 in History.

== Career ==
=== Lee and Herring ===
Between 1992 and 2000, Richard was half of the stand-up comedy double act with Stewart Lee. Their television work included &quot;Fist of Fun&quot;, Festival of Fun, and &quot;This Morning With Richard Not Judy&quot;, and they had been collaborating on stage and radio projects since the 1980s.

Lee and Herring wrote material for Chris Morris and Armando Iannucci&#x27;s &quot;On the Hour&quot; in 1991 and the duo contributed to the creation of the character that was to be Alan Partridge. In 1992 and 1993, they wrote and performed &quot;Lionel Nimrod&#x27;s Inexplicable World&quot; for Radio 4. For Radio 1, they wrote and performed one series of &quot;Fist of Fun&quot; in 1993, remaking it for television in 1995 and 1996. They hosted a series on Radio 1 in 1994 and 1995, called &quot;Lee and Herring&quot;. A final television partnership with Lee, &quot;This Morning With Richard Not Judy&quot;, ran for 18 episodes over two series was eventually cancelled &quot;as a result of BBC management reshuffles&quot;.

=== Solo work ===

Herring has written and performed in fourteen one-person shows, eleven of them in consecutive years. A Herring show typically starts with a run at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, continues with an extensive UK tour and ends with a recorded performance for DVD.

For radio, Herring co-wrote and presented the history-based sketch show &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot;. For television, he co-wrote Al Murray&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Time Gentlemen Please&quot;. He also contributed to the third series of &quot;Little Britain&quot; as script editor.

In 2005, he presented a chat show called &quot;Heads Up with Richard Herring&quot; on the Pokerzone channel, in which he interviewed professional poker players and celebrities about their careers and their love of the game. There were 10 episodes in total.

In February 2007, filming began on Herring&#x27;s comedy drama &quot;You Can Choose Your Friends&quot;. As well as writing the script, he also acted alongside Gordon Kennedy, Claire Skinner, Rebecca Front, Sarah-Jane Potts, Robert Daws, Anton Rodgers and Julia McKenzie. The show was broadcast on ITV on 7 June 2007.

In January 2008 he began the &quot;Collings and Herrin&quot; (sic) podcast with Andrew Collins. They celebrated their second anniversary with a live &quot;100th&quot; podcast (it was actually the 105th recording) at the Leicester Square Theatre. On 30 January 2010 the pair began a tenure of sitting in for Adam and Joe on BBC Radio 6 Music on Saturdays mornings, a slot they occupied for more than a year.

Herring&#x27;s 2008 stand-up set &quot;The Headmaster&#x27;s Son&quot; earned four 5-star reviews and several 4-star reviews. The set covers his experience growing up in The Kings of Wessex School in Somerset where his father worked as headmaster and how this may have been the origin of his fondness for telling puerile jokes. The show was seen by critics as a thoughtful look at his upbringing, and his relationship with his father, to whom the show is dedicated.

Herring launched his show, &quot;Hitler Moustache&quot; in 2009 to see if he &quot;could reclaim the toothbrush moustache for comedy – it was Chaplin&#x27;s first, then Hitler ruined it.&quot; The show discusses broader issues, such as fascism and the British National Party. Herring and some of his contemporaries, including Dave Gorman, were angered when material from his show was misrepresented in a &quot;Guardian&quot; column by critic Brian Logan.

On 14 October 2010, his Radio 4 series &quot;Richard Herring&#x27;s Objective&quot; was first broadcast. Here Herring attempts to reclaim controversial items, starting with the toothbrush moustache and moving onto the hoodie, Flag of England and Dolly the Sheep. An Edinburgh special about the See-you-Jimmy hat was broadcast in August 2011 and a second series was recorded in October 2011 with episodes about the golliwog, the wheelchair, Page 3 and the old school tie.

On 27 December 2010, Herring finished second on &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; with a final score of 34 points. His specialist subject was Rasputin. He was &quot;The Pod Delusion&quot; &quot;Comedian of the Year 2010.&quot;

In May 2011 it was announced that &quot;Fist of Fun&quot; would be released on DVD by Go Faster Stripe. The first series was released in December 2011 and the second in November 2012, winning &#x27;Best DVD&#x27; at the 2013 Chortle Awards

In August and September 2015, he performed all 11 of his previous one man shows, plus a new one, &quot;Happy Now?&quot;, at the Leicester Square Theatre over the course of six weekends in a season called &quot;The Twelve Shows of Herring&quot;. &quot;Happy Now?&quot; was taken on a 50-plus date UK tour between October 2015 and June 2016. His 2017 tour show was called &quot;Richard Herring — The Best&quot;. His 2017 Edinburgh Fringe show is called &quot;Oh Frig, I&#x27;m 50!&quot; This was taken on a UK tour in the Spring of 2018.

In 2020, Herring was a contestant on the tenth series of &quot;Taskmaster&quot;. He was the series&#x27; eventual winner. Herring later returned to compete against fellow winners Ed Gamble, Kerry Godliman, Liza Tarbuck and Lou Sanders for the second &quot;Champion of Champions&quot; special, which he also won.

In May 2024 he began a tour of a new stand up show, &#x27;Can I Have My Ball Back?&#x27; based on his experience of testicular cancer. A second leg of the tour began on 31st January 2025.

=== Blogs, podcasts and internet ===
On 25 November 2002 Herring started his blog, &quot;Warming Up&quot;, as a way to overcome writer&#x27;s block. He has written an entry for every day, and has over 7,000 consecutive entries. His regular readership is estimated to be around 3,000. Some ideas recorded in &quot;Warming Up&quot; have been used in his live shows. The first year of his blog is collected in two books, &quot;Bye Bye Balham&quot; and &quot;The Box Lady and Other Pesticles&quot;.

On 12 October 2009, Herring recorded the first episode of &quot;As It Occurs To Me&quot;, a weekly radio-style stand-up and sketch show made for the Internet. It stars himself alongside Emma Kennedy, Dan Tetsell and Christian Reilly. It currently stands at 18 episodes and 5 bonus mini-episodes. It was nominated for best internet show at the 2010 Sony Awards, though it failed to place. On 7 February 2011, &quot;As It Occurs to Me&quot; won the first Chortle Internet award On 20 March 2012 he retained it. In 2017, &quot;As It Occurs To Me&quot; returned as a six-episode web series.

In 2011, Herring began playing himself at snooker for an audio podcast called &quot;Me1 vs Me2 Snooker&quot;. On 28 July 2016 he performed at the Tempting Failure extreme art festival In 2020 he started playing this with 32 personas on Twitch and appeared on Comedians: Home Alone on BBC2 in July with an edited frame of Me1 vs Me2.

In 2012, Herring recorded the first 16 episodes of the long-running &quot;Richard Herring&#x27;s Leicester Square Theatre Podcast&quot; with guests including Tim Minchin, Herring&#x27;s comedy partner Stewart Lee, Adam Buxton, David Mitchell and Armando Iannucci. It was nominated for a Sony Award for Best Comedy alongside a list of BBC produced comedy shows in 2013. The show won the Bronze Award. In 2013, Herring won the Chortle Award for the podcast, which again won the award in 2014. In May and June 2013 he recorded nine podcasts with guests including Stephen Fry, Russell Brand and Mary Beard. His interview with Stephen Fry was covered by national and international news media including the BBC and Sky News when Fry revealed a recent suicide attempt. The series continued with Harry Shearer, Eddie Izzard and David Cross.

On 17 November 2013, he recorded the first episode of a six-part internet stand-up, sketch and interview show &quot;Richard Herring&#x27;s Meaning of Life,&quot; structured around the philosophical concepts of &#x27;Creation&#x27;, &#x27;the Paranormal&#x27;, &#x27;Love&#x27;, &#x27;Death&#x27;, &#x27;Good &amp; Evil&#x27; and &#x27;the Shape of Things To Come&#x27;, the episode being broadcast online between February 2014 and early 2015.

In February 2014, the first &quot;Richard Herring Show&quot; was broadcast on Fubar Radio. Herring presented this with comedian Lou Sanders weekly, before quitting the show together; their final episode was broadcast on 24 May 2014.

On 8 March 2018, in aid of International Women’s Day, Herring raised over £150,000 for domestic abuse charity Refuge by responding to anyone on Twitter who asked when International Men&#x27;s Day was (it is 19 November). He did the same on 8 March 2019, raising almost £130,000. He repeated the exercise on 8 March 2020 and streamed himself responding to tweets live on Twitch. He raised a further £70,000. In 2020 he wrote a book about his experiences and toxic masculinity called &quot;The Problem With Men&quot; which was published on 5 November.

In March 2020 Herring started streaming regularly on Twitch as the world went into lockdown. He produced weekly remote episodes of his podcast, &quot;Richard Herring&#x27;s Leicester Square Theatre Podcast&quot;, did a live feed of Stone Clearing most weekday mornings and played himself at snooker (with 32 personas) in the evening. He also did occasional non-director&#x27;s commentaries for films, as well as a newspaper review with his 128-year-old ventriloquist dummy called &quot;Ally and Herring&#x27;s Twitch of Fun&quot;.

In June 2023, Herring announced he would be touring &quot;Richard Herring&#x27;s Leicester Square Theatre Podcast&quot; around the UK starting September 2023.

== Motifs and tropes ==

* Misspelling words for comic effect, most commonly by adding a superfluous &#x27;s&#x27; (as in &#x27;John Majors&#x27;) or &#x27;g&#x27; (as in &#x27;skellington&#x27;).
* Recurrence of the name Ian for characters, especially as a stand-in name for the imagined director of a company (as in &#x27;Ian Starbucks&#x27;).
* Unlikely acronyms (as in for &quot;This Morning With Richard Not Judy&quot;) and complex, self-defeating mnemonics (as in for the genealogy of Christ).
* Suggesting ruinous philistine improvements to classic works, including &quot;extra final scenes&quot; for &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; or that a well-received film would be better &quot;with a Shrek in it&quot;.
* Introducing guests on the Richard Herring’s Leicester Square Theatre Podcast with &quot;…who is probably better known for…&quot; and quoting an obscure early appearance.
* Telling the audience at the start of the second in a back-to-back recording that &quot;…you’re much better than last week’s audience.&quot;
* Asking audience members, &quot;Do you work in IT?&quot;
* Asking podcast guests ‘emergency questions’, of which a frequent one is, &quot;Have you ever tried to suck your own cock?&quot;
* Frequent references to the film &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;. 
* When referring to the Richard Herring’s Leicester Square Theatre Podcast, saying, &quot;…what the cool kids are calling &quot;RHLSTP&quot; ())&quot;, to which the audience reply, &quot;RHLSTP&quot;.
* Spelling &quot;stone&quot; &quot;ftone&quot; in reference to his Stone Clearing podcast/project/meme.

<text>Human physical appearance is the outward phenotype or look of human beings.
There are functionally infinite variations in human phenotypes, though society reduces the variability to distinct categories. The physical appearance of humans, in particular those attributes which are regarded as important for physical attractiveness, are believed by anthropologists to affect the development of personality significantly and social relations. Many humans are acutely sensitive to their physical appearance. Some differences in human appearance are genetic, others are the result of age, lifestyle or disease, and many are the result of personal adornment.

Some people have linked some differences with ethnicity, such as skeletal shape, prognathism or elongated stride. Different cultures place different degrees of emphasis on physical appearance and its importance to social status and other phenomena.

== Aspects ==
Various aspects are considered relevant to the physical appearance of humans.

=== Physiological differences ===

Humans are distributed across the globe except for Antarctica and form a variable species. In adults, the average weight varies from around 40 kg (88 pounds) for the smallest and most lightly built tropical people to around 80 kg (176 pounds) for the heavier northern peoples. Size also varies between the sexes, with the sexual dimorphism in humans being more pronounced than that of chimpanzees, but less than the dimorphism found in gorillas. The colouration of skin, hair and eyes also varies considerably, with darker pigmentation dominating in tropical climates and lighter in polar regions.
*Genetic, ethnic affiliation, geographical ancestry.
* Height, body weight, skin tone, body hair, sexual organs, hair color, hair texture, eye color, eye shape (see epicanthic fold and eyelid variations), nose shape (see nasal bridge), ear shape (see earlobes), body shape
*Body and skin variations such as amputations, scars, burns and wounds.

=== Long-term physiological changes ===
*Aging
*Hair loss
=== Short-term physiological changes ===
*Blushing, crying, fainting, hiccup, yawning, laughing, stuttering, sexual arousal, sweating, shivering, skin color changes due to sunshine or frost.

=== Clothing, personal effects, and intentional body modifications ===
*Clothing, including headgear and footwear; some clothes alter or mold the shape of the body (e.g. corset, support pantyhose, bra). As for footwear, high heels make a person look taller.
* Style and colour of haircut (see also mohawk, dreadlocks, braids, ponytail, wig, hairpin, facial hair, beard and moustache)
*Cosmetics, stage makeup, body paintings, permanent makeup
*Body modifications, such as body piercings, tattoos, scarification, subdermal implants
*Plastic surgery
*Decorative objects (jewelry) such as necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings
*Medical or body shape altering devices (&quot;e.g.&quot;, tooth braces, bandages, casts, hearing aids, cervical collar, crutches, contact lenses of different colours, glasses, gold teeth). For example, the same person&#x27;s appearance can be quite different, depending on whether they use any of the aforementioned modifications.
*Exercises, for example, bodybuilding

=== Other functional objects, temporarily attached to the body ===
*Capes
*Goggles
*Hair ornaments
*Hats and caps
*Headdresses
*Headphones/handsfree phone headset
*Jewelry
*Masks
*Prosthetic limbs
*Sunglasses
*Watches

<text>Stewart Graham Lee (born 5 April 1968) is an English comedian. His stand-up routine is characterised by repetition, internal reference, and deadpan delivery.

Lee began his career in 1989 and formed the comedy duo Lee and Herring with Richard Herring. In 2001, he co-wrote and co-directed the West End hit musical &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot;, a critical success that sparked a backlash from Christian right groups who staged a series of protests outside its early stagings. In 2011, he won British Comedy Awards for Best Male Television Comic and Best Comedy Entertainment Programme for his series &quot;Stewart Lee&#x27;s Comedy Vehicle&quot;. He has written music reviews for publications including &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

In 2009 &quot;The Times&quot; referred to Lee as &quot;the comedian&#x27;s comedian, and for good reason&quot; and named him &quot;face of the decade&quot;. In 2012, he was placed at No. 9 on a poll of the 100 most influential people in UK comedy. In 2018, &quot;The Times&quot; named him as the best current English-language comedian.

==Early life==
Stewart Graham Lee was born on 5 April 1968 in Wellington, Shropshire. He was adopted as a child and grew up in Solihull, West Midlands. His adoptive parents separated when he was four, and he was raised by his mother. He attended the Solihull School on a part scholarship, and received what he calls a &quot;waifs and strays bursary&quot; because he was adopted. He participated in the school&#x27;s mountain-walking club, which went on regular excursions to Snowdonia; the original members of the grindcore band Napalm Death also took part. As a teenager, Lee suffered from ulcerative colitis, which he has said caused significant weight loss and made him look &quot;cadaverously thin&quot;. He has described how at the age of 16, he was &quot;doing a lot of reading, going to gigs, buying records and listening to the John Peel show&quot;. He later read English at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, graduating with a 2:1.

==Career==
===1989–1999: stand-up, radio and TV===

While a student at Oxford in the 1980s, he wrote and performed comedy in a revue group called The Seven Raymonds with Richard Herring, Emma Kennedy and Tim Richardson but did not perform in the well-known Oxford Revue, though he did write for and direct the 1989 production. Having moved to London and begun performing stand-up comedy after university, he rose to greater prominence in 1990, winning the prestigious Hackney Empire New Act of the Year competition.

With Herring, Lee wrote material for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;On the Hour&quot; (1991), which was anchored by Chris Morris and was notable for the first appearance of Steve Coogan&#x27;s celebrated character, Alan Partridge, for which Lee and Herring wrote early material. Owing to creative differences with the rest of the cast, Lee and Herring did not remain with the group when &quot;On The Hour&quot; moved to television as &quot;The Day Today.&quot;

In 1992 and 1993, he and Herring wrote and performed &quot;Lionel Nimrod&#x27;s Inexplicable World&quot; for BBC Radio 4, before moving to BBC Radio 1, for one series of &quot;Fist of Fun&quot; (1993), followed by three series of &quot;Lee and Herring&quot;. In 1995-6 two series of a television version of Fist of Fun were broadcast by BBC2, followed in 1998-9 by two series of This Morning With Richard Not Judy. Throughout the late nineties he continued performing solo stand-up (even whilst in the double act Lee and Herring) and collaborated with, amongst others, Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding of &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot;. Indeed, though Barratt and Fielding had worked together in the past, the first seeds of the Boosh were sown while working as part of Lee&#x27;s Edinburgh show &quot;King Dong vs Moby Dick&quot; in which Barratt and Fielding played a giant penis and a whale, respectively. Lee returned the favour by going on to direct their 1999 Edinburgh show, &quot;Arctic Boosh&quot;, which remains the template for their live work.

===2000–2004: quitting stand-up===
In 2001 Lee published his first novel, &quot;The Perfect Fool&quot;. In the same year he performed &quot;Pea Green Boat&quot;, a stand-up show which revolved around the deconstruction of the Edward Lear poem &quot;The Owl and the Pussy-Cat&quot; and a tale of his own broken toilet. This would later be condensed to focus mainly on the poem itself, and a 15-minute version aired on Radio 4. In 2007, Go Faster Stripe released a 25-minute edit on CD and 10&quot; Vinyl.

During late 2000 and early 2001, Lee retired from stand-up comedy. 2001 became the first year since 1987 that he did not perform at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. While Lee found himself gradually performing less stand-up and moving away from the stage, he continued his directorial duties on television. Two pilots were made for Channel 4, &quot;Cluub Zarathustra&quot; and &quot;Head Farm&quot;, but neither was developed into a series. The former featured all the ingredients that would later appear in &quot;Attention Scum&quot;, a BBC Two series fronted by Simon Munnery&#x27;s &quot;League Against Tedium&quot; character, which also featured Kevin Eldon, Johnny Vegas and Roger Mann, as well as Richard Thomas and opera singer Lore Lixenberg.

At the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Lee directed Johnny Vegas&#x27;s first DVD, &quot;Who&#x27;s Ready For Ice Cream?&quot;. In 2004, he returned to stand-up comedy with the show &quot;Standup Comedian&quot;. Lee is a regular music critic for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In 2003, he said that his favourite bands include The Fall, Giant Sand and Calexico and that he listens to &quot;a lot of jazz, 60s and folk music but I really like Ms. Dynamite and The Streets&quot;.

===2005–2008: &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot;===

In January 2005, &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot;, a satirical musical/opera written by Lee and Richard Thomas and based upon &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;, was broadcast on BBC Two, following a highly successful West End run for several years, and as a prelude to the show&#x27;s UK Tour. Christian Voice led a number of protest groups who claimed that the show was blasphemous and highly offensive. In particular, they were angered by the portrayal of Jesus. Disputes arose, with supporters claiming that most of the protesters had neither seen the show nor knew of its content. Others supported the right to freedom of speech. Several Christian groups protested at some of the venues used during the UK Tour. The show was broadcast with a record number of complaints prior to its transmission. In total, the BBC received 55,000 complaints. A private court case brought by Christian Voice against Lee and others involved with the production for blasphemy was rejected by a magistrates&#x27; court.

In 2006, finding himself &quot;really broke&quot; he appeared as a guest on three comedy panel shows. The first was &quot;Never Mind The Buzzcocks&quot;, where Simon Amstell made frequent mock-offended references to the controversy over &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot;. This was followed by appearances on &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot; and &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot;, before Lee decided to quit them altogether. A profile in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in 2011 stated Lee did not want to alienate his audience in exchange for quick money by such appearances, as working as a stand-up had been the only thing that had generated reliable income for him.

===2009–2010: &quot;Comedy Vehicle&quot;===
&quot;Stewart Lee&#x27;s Comedy Vehicle&quot;, a six-part comedy series featuring standup and sketches, began a six-episode run on 16 March 2009. The executive producer was Armando Iannucci and the script editor was Chris Morris. The first episode received positive reviews from &quot;The Independent&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. Lee wrote a negative review of the show in &quot;Time Out&quot; in which he described himself as &quot;fat&quot; and his performance as &quot;positively Neanderthal, suggesting a jungle-dwelling pygmy, struggling to coax notes out of a clarinet that has fallen from a passing aircraft&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as &quot;the kind of TV that makes you feel like you&#x27;re not the only one wondering how we came to be surrounded by so much unquestioned mediocrity&quot;. One of the show&#x27;s few negative reviews came in the &quot;Sunday Mercury&quot;, &quot;His whole tone is one of complete, smug condescension&quot;. Lee used the line to advertise his next stand-up tour. Lee frequently uses negative reviews on his posters in order to put off potential audience members who are unlikely to be fans of his comedy style. The first episode was watched by approximately one million viewers. The series was the BBC&#x27;s second most downloaded broadcast during its run. In May 2010, the series was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for best comedy programme. The series won a BAFTA for best comedy programme in 2012. The show was cancelled after four seasons on BBC Two.

===2011–2019: &quot;The Alternative Comedy Experience&quot;===
Although Lee had been supported by less established acts on his comedy tours before (including Josie Long and Tony Law), 2011 marked a shift in his career towards doing a lot to promote other creative comedy talents. He produced &quot;At Last! The 1981 Show&quot;, featuring veteran alternative comedians including Alexei Sayle and Norman Lovett at the Royal Festival Hall in May 2011 and by 2013 he was fronting a comedy showcase on Comedy Central called &quot;The Alternative Comedy Experience&quot; which featured 38 comedians who identified with alternative comedy, including Robin Ince, Sam Simmons and Eleanor Tiernan. The show ran for 25 episodes 2013–14, but in 2015 Lee confirmed that Comedy Central were not commissioning a third series.

===2020s: recent work===
In September 2020, Asian Dub Foundation (a political band from London who had a Top 40 hit with &quot;Buzzin&#x27;&quot; in 1998) released a song called &quot;Comin&#x27; Over Here&quot;, which was based on a sketch from &quot;Lee&#x27;s Comedy Vehicle&quot; about the UKIP party leader Paul Nuttall. In December 2020, Lee teamed up with Asian Dub Foundation to release a video for the song, which was at that time part of an internet campaign (in the style of LadBaby, Rage Against The Machine et al.) to get the record to number one in time for the chart published by the Official Charts Company on 31 December 2020, thereby making the record the &#x27;Brexit Day Number One&#x27;. On 1 December 2020, the song debuted at number 65, making it the week&#x27;s highest new entry and the best selling single of the week (though &quot;Comin&#x27; Over Here&quot; was absent from the Official Audio Streaming Chart Top 100). In 2020, Lee wrote the documentary film &quot;King Rocker&quot; about singer Robert Lloyd and the band The Nightingales. The film featured Frank Skinner, Marc Riley, Robin Askwith, Duran Duran&#x27;s John Taylor and Samira Ahmed. In 2022, Lee removed his material from Spotify because it refused to stop &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; spreading COVID-19 misinformation on its platform.

Lee took part in &quot;A Show for Gareth Richards&quot; at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2023, which was staged by fellow comedians Mark Simmons and Danny Ward to honour Richards life after he died in a car-crash in April 2023. The show won the first Victoria Wood award at the Edinburgh Comedy Awards 2023 and raised almost £20,000 for Gareth&#x27;s family.

In 2023 Lee wrote a contemporary version of the Porter scene for the Royal Shakespeare Company production of &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Director Wils Wilson said &quot;The Porter is dark, funny, edgy, political, clever, a truth teller - Stewart is all of these things, and straight away I knew I wanted to ask him to write to. He has a really deep understanding of how comedy works. The Porter scene is a strange meta moment in Macbeth and I knew Stewart would enjoy playing with that.&quot;

In 2024 Lee performed his latest tour show &quot;Basic Lee&quot; at &quot;The Lowry&quot; in Salford, which was filmed and broadcast on 20 July by Sky Comedy, as &quot;Stewart Lee, Basic Lee: Live at the Lowry&quot;. The film was produced by Drum Studios in association with Awkward Films, with producer director Colin Dench.

==Style and material==
Lee&#x27;s influences include Ted Chippington, Arnold Brown, Norman Lovett, Jerry Sadowitz, Simon Munnery, Kevin McAleer and Johnny Vegas.

His comedy covers a wide range of forms and subject material. It is often topical, observational, self-deprecating and absurd. Notable routines have focused on topics like religion, political correctness and artistic integrity. He also employs meta-humour, openly describing the structure and intent of the set while onstage, and abolishing the illusion of his routines as spontaneous acts.

Lee&#x27;s delivery uses various onstage personae, frequently alternating between that of an outspoken left-wing hero and that of a depressed failure and champagne socialist. In an ironic manner, he often criticises the audience for not being intelligent enough to understand his jokes, saying they would prefer more simplistic material, or enjoy the work of more mainstream &quot;arena&quot; comedians such as Michael McIntyre or Lee Mack; He will also scold them as a bias-seeking &quot;liberal intelligentsia&quot;. His routines often culminate in feigned depressive episodes and nervous breakdowns.

Lee caused controversy on his &quot;If You Prefer a Milder Comedian&quot; tour with a routine about &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter Richard Hammond. Referring to Hammond&#x27;s accident while filming in 2006, in which he was almost killed, Lee joked, &quot;I wish he had been decapitated&quot;. When he was doorstepped by a &quot;Daily Mail&quot; journalist, Lee quoted the routine by replying &quot;It&#x27;s a joke, just like on &quot;Top Gear&quot; when they do their jokes&quot;. He said, &quot;People who read things like that in the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; and who think Clarkson is funny aren&#x27;t going to come and see me, so it doesn&#x27;t matter&quot;. Explaining the joke, Lee said:

In an &quot;Observer&quot; interview, Sean O&#x27;Hagan says of the Hammond joke that Lee &quot;operates out in that dangerous hinterland between moral provocation and outright offence, often adopting, as in this instance, the tactics of those he targets in order to highlight their hypocrisy&quot;.

After accepting an honorary fellowship from St Edmund Hall, Oxford, Lee gave a lecture to aspiring writers in which he discussed the fact that performers such as Frankie Boyle, Michael McIntyre, Jack Whitehall and Andi Osho used writers who were not credited. He compared the practice to athletes using performance-enhancing drugs. Along with plagiarism and extremism, Lee has brought moral issues surrounding stand-up to the public&#x27;s attention.

==Personal life==
Lee married comedian Bridget Christie in 2006; they separated amicably in 2021. He lives in Stoke Newington and has two children. He is a patron of Humanists UK, a member of Arts Emergency and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society.
Lee has stated that he had an unofficial autism diagnosis from his GP.

As of 2024, Lee is in a relationship with fellow comedian Rosie Holt.

<text>The Parliament of Finland ( ; ) is the unicameral and supreme legislature of Finland, founded on 9 May 1906. In accordance with the Constitution of Finland, sovereignty belongs to the people, and that power is vested in the Parliament. The Parliament consists of 200 members, 199 of whom are elected every four years from 13 multi-member districts electing 6 to 37 members using the proportional D&#x27;Hondt method. In addition, there is one member from Åland.

Legislation may be initiated by either the Government or one of the members of Parliament. The Parliament passes legislation, decides on the state budget, approves international treaties, and supervises the activities of the government. It may bring about the resignation of the Finnish Government, override presidential vetoes, and alter the constitution. To make changes to the constitution, amendments must be approved by two successive parliaments, with an election cycle in between, or passed as an emergency law with a 167/200 majority. Most MPs work in parliamentary groups which correspond with the political parties. The Parliament currently comprises nine parliamentary groups. Since the establishment of the Parliament in 1905, the parliamentary majority has been held once by a single party: the Social Democrats in the 1916 election. Thus, for the Government to gain a majority in the Parliament, coalition governments are favored. These are generally formed by at least two of the three historically major parties: the Social Democrats, Centre, and National Coalition. Ministers are often but not necessarily MPs. The Parliament meets in the Parliament House (, ), which is located in central Helsinki.

The most recent parliamentary election took place on 2 April 2023. After the 2023 election the Orpo Cabinet was formed by the National Coalition, Finns and Swedish People&#x27;s parties as well as the Christian Democrats.

== Name ==

=== Finnish ===
The Parliament&#x27;s Finnish name is , uncapitalized. The word was created in 1906 when the unicameral Parliament was established, with the approximate meaning of an &#x27;Assembly of Representatives&#x27;. This word is used mostly to refer to Finland&#x27;s legislature but can also be used as a general term for legislatures in any country.

=== Swedish ===
In Swedish, the Parliament&#x27;s name is , uncapitalized. This is also the general term for the Swedish legislature. derives from the genitive of (&#x27;realm&#x27;) referring to the independent state of Finland, and , meaning diet or conference. 

Before independence, until the Constitution Act of 1919, the Parliament was known, in Swedish, as (cognate of &quot;landtag&quot;, having the sense of &quot;subnational assembly&quot;) which was the old term for the Diet of Finland.

== History ==

The Parliament of Finland was preceded by the Diet of Finland (; , modern ), which had succeeded the Riksdag of the Estates in 1809. When the unicameral Parliament of Finland was established by the Parliament Act in 1906, Finland was an autonomous grand duchy and principality under the Imperial Russian Tsar, who ruled as the Grand Duke, rather than as an absolute monarch. Universal suffrage and eligibility was implemented, making Finland the second country in the world to adopt universal suffrage. Women could both vote and run for office as equals, and this applied also to landless people, with no excluded minorities. The first election to the Parliament was arranged in 1907. The first Parliament had 19 female representatives, an unprecedented number at the time, which grew to 21 by 1913.
The first years of the new Parliament were difficult. Between 1908 and 1916 the power of the Finnish Parliament was almost completely neutralized by the Russian Tsar Nicholas II and the so-called &quot;sabre senate&quot; of Finland, a bureaucratic government formed by Imperial Russian Army officers during the second period of &quot;Russification&quot;. The Parliament was dissolved and new elections were held almost every year.
The Finnish Parliament received the true political power for the first time after the February Revolution (First Revolution) of 1917 in Russia. Finland declared its full independence on 6 December 1917, and in the winter and spring of 1918 endured a civil war in which the forces of the Senate, known as the White Guard, defeated the socialist Red Guard.

After the war, monarchists and republicans struggled over the country&#x27;s form of government. The monarchists seemed to gain a victory when the Parliament elected a German prince as King of Finland in the fall of 1918. This decision was made on the basis of the other Nordic countries also having monarchs. However, the king-elect abdicated the throne after Imperial Germany was defeated in World War I, on 11 November 1918. In the parliamentary election of 1919, the republican parties won three-quarters of the seats, extinguishing the monarchists&#x27; ambitions. Finland became a republic with a parliamentary system, but in order to appease the monarchist parties, which favoured a strong head of state, extensive powers were granted to the President of Finland.

When the Soviet Union attacked Finland in the Winter War, in early December 1939 Parliament was evacuated and the legislature temporarily relocated to Kauhajoki, a town in western Finland far away from the frontline. The parliament held 34 plenary sessions in Kauhajoki, with the last on 12 February 1940. Another temporary relocation was seen during the renovation of the Parliament House in 2015–2017 when the Parliament convened in the neighbouring Sibelius Academy.

The Constitution of 1919, which instituted a parliamentary system, did not undergo any major changes for 70 years. Although the government was responsible to the Parliament, the President wielded considerable authority, which was used to its full extent by long-standing President Urho Kekkonen. As the Constitution implemented very strong protections for political minorities, most changes in legislation and state finances could be blocked by a qualified minority of one third. This, in conjunction with the inability of some of the parties to enter into coalition governments, led to weak, short-lived cabinets.

During President Mauno Koivisto&#x27;s tenure in the 1980s, cabinets sitting for the whole parliamentary term became the norm. At the same time, the ability of qualified minorities to block legislation was gradually removed and the powers of the Parliament were greatly increased in the constitutional reform of 1991.

The revised 2000 draft of the Finnish constitution removed almost all domestic powers of the President, strengthening the position of the cabinet and the Parliament. It also included the methods for the discussion of EU legislation under preparation in the Parliament.

===Dissolutions of Parliament===
The Parliament of Finland has been dissolved before the end of its term fourteen times during its existence. The most recent instance was on 4 June 1975.
==Elections==
The Parliament&#x27;s 200 representatives are elected directly by ballot on the basis of proportional representation. A standard electoral period is four years. Elections have previously taken two days, but as early voting has become more popular, they are now conducted during one day; the third Sunday of April of an election year.

Every Finnish citizen who is at least 18 years of age on the election date is entitled to vote in general elections. There is normally no need to register as a voter, and citizens receive an invitation by mail. With certain exceptions, such as military personnel on active duty, high judicial officials, the President of the Republic, and persons under guardianship, any voter may also stand as a candidate for the Parliament. All registered parties are entitled to nominate candidates; individual citizens and independent electoral organizations must be endorsed by a sufficient number of voters through the form of to apply.

In parliamentary elections, Finland is divided into 13 electoral districts. The number of representatives granted to each district is proportional to its population, except for Åland, which always elects one representative. The provincial state offices appoint an election board in each electoral district to prepare lists of candidates and to approve the election results. The Ministry of Justice has the ultimate responsibility for holding elections.

The President of Finland can call for an early election. As per the version of the constitution currently in use, the president can do this only upon proposal by the Prime Minister and after consultations with the parliamentary groups while the Parliament is in session. In prior versions of the constitution, the President had the power to do this unilaterally.

There is no hard and fast election threshold to get a seat in Parliament. This results in a large number of parties being represented. In 2019, for instance, nine parties won seats, with six winning at least 15 seats. With so many parties and the lack of a threshold, it is nearly impossible for one party to win an outright majority. During the history of the Parliament, only one party has ever won an outright majority–when the Social Democrats won 103 seats in the election of 1916. Since independence in 1917, no party has ever won the 101 seats needed for a majority. Instead, most Finnish governments have been coalitions formed by three or more parties. Many of them have been grand coalitions between parties with varying ideological backgrounds, as the socialist and non-socialist blocs usually do not win enough seats between them to govern on their own.

The seats for each electoral district are assigned according to the D&#x27;Hondt method. Electoral districts were originally based on the historical lääni division of 1634, but there have been several subsequent changes. Although there is no set election threshold, many electoral districts have become smaller in terms of population in recent decades, and some now elect as few as six representatives. This makes it harder for small parties to win MPs in these districts.

==Parliamentary groups==

MPs work in parliamentary groups (). The parliamentary groups generally correspond to political parties, although occasionally dissidents can be removed from the party group and form their own. there are nine groups, one of which is a one-man group. A group generally tries to reach a unanimous decision on a common position, but failing to do so may take a vote. This position then defines voting in the parliamentary session proper according to party discipline. Exceptions to this principle are made on matters on which no party line or government policy exists. Parliamentary groups make their decisions independently of their party leadership, and group leaders of major parties accordingly rank alongside government ministers and party leaders as influential political leaders.

Each parliamentary group receives funding for its operations and may have staff of its own.

==Formation of government==
The President of Finland consults the Speaker of Parliament and representatives of parliamentary groups about the formation of a new Finnish Government. According to the Constitution of Finland, the Parliament elects the Prime Minister, who is appointed to office by the President. The Prime Minister is, in practice, the most powerful politician in the country. Other ministers are appointed by the President on the Prime Minister&#x27;s proposal. While individual ministers are not appointed by the Parliament, they may be individually removed by a motion of no confidence. The government, as a whole, must also have the confidence of the Parliament and must resign on a motion of no confidence. The government has collective ministerial responsibility.

Before the Prime Minister is elected, the parliamentary groups (which correspond to their respective political parties) negotiate on the government platform and on the composition of the government. On the basis of the outcome of these negotiations, and after having consulted the Speaker of the house and the parliamentary groups, the President informs the Parliament of the nominee for Prime Minister. The parliament votes on the proposal, and if successful, the nominee is elected Prime Minister. Although Finland essentially always has multi-party coalition governments, the process is made smoother by party discipline: coalition MPs vote together to ensure a majority.

== Sessions ==
The annual session of parliament generally begins in February and consists of two terms, the first from January to June, the second from September to December. At the start of an annual session, the nation&#x27;s political leaders and their guests attend a special worship service at Helsinki Cathedral before the ceremonies continue at the Parliament House, where the President formally opens the session.

On the first day of each annual session, the Parliament selects a speaker and two deputy speakers from its members. This election is chaired by the oldest MP in office. The three members who are elected to serve as speaker and first deputy speaker and second deputy speaker respectively take the following solemn oath before the Parliament;&quot;I, [name of the MP], affirm that in my office as Speaker I will to the best of my ability defend the rights of the people, Parliament and the government of Finland according to the Constitution.&quot;During each annual session of Parliament, Finland&#x27;s delegations to the Nordic Council and the Council of Europe are assigned. The Parliament also elects five of its members to the bench of the High Court of Impeachment for the duration of the parliamentary term.

==Committees==

The Parliament has 17 committees. Most committees have 17 permanent members, except for the Grand Committee, which has 25; the Finance Committee, which has 21; and the Audit and Intelligence Oversight Committees, which have 11 each. In addition to these permanent members, each of the committees has a number of substitute members. On average, each member of the Parliament is also a member of two committees.

Most of the committees are special committees, while the Grand Committee deals with EU affairs, but also has a wider range of tasks. As Finland does not have a constitutional court, the role of the Constitutional Law Committee is to oversee constitutional affairs. The Committee for the Future is also noteworthy, as it does not usually deal with bills, but instead assesses factors relating to future developments and gives statements to other committees on issues relating to the future outlooks of their respective fields of speciality. The newest committee is the Intelligence Oversight Committee which was created in 2019.

==Proceedings==
===Domestic legislation===
Most of the bills discussed in the parliament originate within the Council of State. However, any member or group of members may introduce a bill, but usually these will not pass the committee phase. A third way to propose legislation was introduced in 2012: citizens may deliver an initiative for the parliament&#x27;s consideration, if the initiative gains 50,000 endorsements from eligible voters within a period of six months. When delivered to the parliament, the initiative is dealt with in the same way as any other bill. Any bill introduced will initially be discussed by the members of the Parliament, prior to being sent to the committee to which it belongs. If the bill concerns several areas of legislation, the Grand Committee will first ask the other committees for opinions. If there is any concern about the constitutionality of the bill, the opinion of the Constitutional Committee is demanded. The Constitutional Committee works in non-partisan manner and uses the most distinguished legal scholars as experts. If the committee considers the bill to have unconstitutional elements, the bill must either be passed as a constitutional change or changed to be in concordance with the constitution. In most cases, the latter route is chosen.

The bills receive their final form in the parliamentary committees. The committees work behind closed doors but their proceedings are publicized afterwards. Usually the committees hear experts from special interest groups and various authorities after which they formulate the necessary changes to the bill in question. If the committee does not agree, the members in minority may submit their own version of the bill.

The committee statement is discussed by the parliament in two consecutive sessions. In the first session, the parliament discusses the bill and prepares its final form. In the first part of handling, a general discussion of the bill is undertaken. After this, the parliament discusses individual points of the bill and chooses between the bill proposed by the committee, minority opinions and the eventual other forms the members submit during the discussion. If the parliament wishes to do so, it may during the general discussion of the first handling submit the bill to the Grand Committee for further formulation. The bill is also always treated by the Grand Committee if the parliament decides to adopt any other form than the final opinion of the committee. The committee then formulates its own version of the bill and submits this to the parliament which then adopts either its former version or the version of the Grand Committee. The committee statements are influential documents in that they often used by the courts as indicative of the legislator&#x27;s intent.

In the second session, the final formulation of the bill is either passed or dismissed. If the bill entails a change in constitution, the second session takes place only after the next election unless the parliament decides to declare the matter to be urgent by a majority of five-sixths. In constitutional matters, the bills are passed by a majority of two-thirds. In other cases, the simple majority of votes given is enough.

International treaties requiring changes to legislation are accepted by a simple majority in a single session. Treaties requiring changes to the constitution or changing the borders of Finland require a qualified majority of two-thirds.

===EU legislation===
The matters relating to the jurisdiction of the European Union are decided by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. However, as changes to European legislation are being prepared, the Parliament participates actively in formulating the government&#x27;s position on these changes.

As the proceedings of the committees are public, European Union matters handled by the Parliament tend to become public after committee meetings. However, the government may ask the Parliament for a secret handling of an EU matter. This can be the case if the government does not want to reveal its position to foreign nations before the beginning of negotiations.

European Union legislation under preparation is brought to the Grand Committee by the Finnish government when they have received notice of the proposal from the European Commission. The Grand Committee discusses the matter behind closed doors, and if appropriate, requests opinions from the committees of the Parliament. Both the Grand Committee and the specialized committees hear expert opinions while preparing their opinions. Finally, the Grand Committee formulates its opinion of the proposal. However, in matters concerning the external relations of the European Union, the Finnish stance is formulated by the Committee for Foreign and Security Policy, rather than the Grand Committee.

The Finnish government is obligated by law to follow the parliamentary opinion when discussing the matter with the European Commission and other member states. The government may change the Finnish stance, but it is required to report such changes to the Parliament immediately.

After the European Union has made a legislative decision that is to be implemented by the Parliament, the matter is brought back to the parliament as with usual legislation. At this stage, the Finnish state is committed to passing a bill fulfilling the requirements demanded by the EU, and the Parliament must vote accordingly.

===Other matters===
Every member of parliament has the right to ask the government written questions. The questions are answered in writing within 21 days by a minister responsible for the matter and do not cause any further discussion. Furthermore, the parliament has a questioning session from time to time. In these, the members are allowed to ask short verbal questions, which are answered by the responsible ministers and then discussed by the parliament.

Any group of twenty members may interpellate. The motion of censure may be for the whole government or any particular minister. The motion takes the form of a question that is replied to by the responsible minister. If the parliament decides to approve the motion of censure, the committee responsible for the matter in question formulates the motion, which is then passed by the parliament.

The government may decide to make a report to the parliament in any matter. After discussion the parliament may either accept the report or pass a motion of censure. A passed motion of censure will cause the government to fall.

Any group of 10 members may raise the question of the legality of the minister&#x27;s official acts. If such question is raised, the Constitutional Committee will investigate the matter, using all the powers of police. After the final report of the committee, the parliament decides whether to charge the minister in the High Court of Impeachment. The criminal investigation of the Constitutional Committee may also be initiated by the Chancellor of Justice, Parliamentary Ombudsman or by any parliamentary committee. Similar proceedings may also be initiated against the Chancellor of Justice, Parliamentary Ombudsman or the judges of the supreme courts. The President of Finland may be also the target of a criminal investigation of the Constitutional Committee, but the parliament must accept the indictment by a majority of three-fourths and the charge must be treason, high treason or a crime against humanity.

==Members of the Parliament==
Members of the Parliament are not employees and cannot voluntarily resign or be laid off. They can be granted leave or dismissal only with the consent of the Parliament. Members of the Parliament enjoy parliamentary immunity. Without the parliament&#x27;s approval, members may not be prosecuted for anything they say in session or otherwise do in the course of parliamentary proceedings. MPs may not be prevented from carrying out their work as members of parliament. They may be charged with crimes they have committed in office only if the parliament gives a permission to that end with a majority of five-sixths of given votes. For other crimes, they may be arrested or imprisoned only for crimes which carry a minimum punishment of six months in prison, unless the parliament gives permission to arrest the member.

The members receive a monthly taxable remuneration (&quot;palkkio&quot;) of 7,137 €, which is raised to 7,494 € after four years of service and to 7,993 € after twelve years. It is legally a &quot;salary&quot;, with the exception that the remuneration is not subject to the unemployment insurance fee—as they not covered by the unemployment benefit system that is funded by the fees. In addition, all MPs automatically receive a tax-free compensation of expenses between 987 € and 1,809 € depending on the location of ones home. MPs from districts far from Helsinki can thus receive compensation for a second apartment in Helsinki. MPs may travel for free within the country by train, bus, or plane for purposes related to legislative work. Within the Helsinki metropolitan area, they may freely use taxis. Eduskunta is responsible for its own finances and the Minister of Finance is obliged to include their proposal to the state budget as is regardless of their own opinion.

MPs are aided in their work by personal assistants, although there are fewer assistants than MPs and not every MP has one. Assistants are formally employed by the Parliamentary Office, but can be selected and directed by the MP.

A member who is elected to the European Parliament must choose between the two parliaments because a double mandate is not permissible. On the other hand, the members may have any municipal positions of trust, and it is common for them to have a position in a municipal council. If MPs leave the parliament or die in office, they are replaced by candidates from the same list they were elected from in the previous election, in order of their electoral score (the D&#x27;Hondt quotient). Those so selected are from a &quot;substitute&quot; list, the substitutes being named at the same time as the electoral results are announced. Finland does not have a by-election system.

The members have an unlimited right to discuss the matters at hand. However, they must behave in a &quot;solemn and dignified manner&quot; and refrain from personal insults. If the member breaks against this rule in the session of parliament, they may be interrupted by the speaker. Grave breaches of order may be punished by two weeks&#x27; suspension from office by the decision of the Parliament. If a member is convicted of an intentional crime for a term in prison or of an electoral crime to any punishment, the parliament may decide to dismiss the member if two-thirds of the votes given are for dismissal.

The median age of MPs was 50 as of 2022, the oldest MP being 76 years (Erkki Tuomioja) and youngest 28 years (Iiris Suomela). 94 women were elected as MPs in the 2019 election (47%), though due to midterm replacements the number of female MPs dropped to 91 (45.5%). 8% of the population is born abroad, however there are only 4 current foreign-born MPs (2%), Bella Forsgrén (born in Ethiopia), Hussein al-Taee (born in Iraq), Suldaan Said Ahmed (born in Somalia) and Aki Lindén (born in Denmark). 7% of MPs are Swedish-speakers, slightly higher than their proportion of the population (5.2%).

== Parliament House ==
Before the construction of the Parliament House, the Parliament met in various different locations. The Diet of Finland, the predecessor of the Parliament, was tetracameral and did not regularly meet together. The Diet of Porvoo (1809) met in various buildings in Porvoo, with Borgå gymnasium as the main hall, the noble and burgher estates meeting in the town hall and the peasants&#x27; estate in chief judge Orraeus&#x27; house. However, the Diet assembled only once and did not reconvene until 1863. In 1863, the Diet began regular meetings again, reconvening in the House of Nobility (Ritarikatu 1). This building still stands, but is no longer in governmental use. Whereas nobility continued to meet there, in 1891 a new House of the Estates was inaugurated for the other estates (clergy, burghers and peasants). This building is today owned by the state and occasionally used by the Government of Finland. When the modern 200-member Parliament was founded in 1906, they first met in the local voluntary fire brigade house (Keskuskatu 7), because there was not enough space for them in the House of Estates. The fire brigade house was demolished in 1967 and replaced by the Helsinki World Trade Center building. In 1911, the Heimola House, a building designed by Onni Tarjanne, was inaugurated at Yliopistonkatu 5. This building was demolished in 1969 and replaced by a 9-story office building.

In 1923 a competition was held to choose a site for a new Parliament House. Arkadianmäki, a hill beside what is now Mannerheimintie, was chosen as the best site. An architectural competition was held in 1924, and it was won by the firm Borg–Sirén–Åberg with their proposal, &quot;Oratoribus&quot;. Johan Sigfrid Sirén (1889–1961), who was mainly responsible for preparing the proposal, was tasked with designing the Parliament House. The building was constructed 1926–1931 and was officially inaugurated on 7 March 1931. Ever since then, and especially during the Winter War and Continuation War, it has been the scene of many key moments in the nation&#x27;s political life.

Parliament House was designed in the classic style of the 1920s. The exterior is reddish Kalvola granite. The façade is lined by fourteen columns with Corinthian capitals. The first floor contains the main lobby, the Speaker&#x27;s reception rooms, the newspaper room, the Information Service, the Documents Office, the messenger centre, the copying room, and the restaurant and separate function rooms. At both ends of the lobby are marble staircases leading up to the fifth floor.

The second or main floor is centered around the Chamber. Its galleries have seats for the public, the media and diplomats. Also located on this floor are the Hall of State, the Speaker&#x27;s Corridor, the Government&#x27;s Corridor, the cafeteria and adjacent function rooms.

The third floor includes facilities for the Information Unit and the media and provides direct access to the press gallery overlooking the Session Hall. The Minutes Office and a number of committee rooms are also located here.

The fourth floor is reserved for committees. Its largest rooms are the Grand Committee Room and the Finance Committee Room. The fifth floor contains meeting rooms and offices for the parliamentary groups. Additional offices for the parliamentary groups are located on the sixth floor, along with facilities for the media.

Notable later additions to the building include the library annex, completed in 1978, and a separate office block, called Pikkuparlamentti, completed in 2004.

The building underwent extensive renovations in the years 2007–2017 as part of the preparation for Finland&#x27;s centennial independence celebration.

<text>Marie Alfred Cornu (; 6 March 1841 – 12 April 1902) was a French physicist. The French generally refer to him as Alfred Cornu.

==Life==
Cornu was born at Orléans to François Cornu and Sophie Poinsellier. He was educated at the École polytechnique and the École des mines. Upon the death of Émile Verdet in 1866, Cornu became, in 1867, Verdet&#x27;s successor as professor of experimental physics at the École polytechnique, where he remained throughout his life. Although he made various excursions into other branches of physical science, undertaking, for example, with Jean-Baptistin Baille about 1870 a repetition of Cavendish&#x27;s experiment for determining the gravitational constant &quot;G&quot;, his original work was mainly concerned with optics and spectroscopy. In particular he carried out a replication of Hippolyte Fizeau&#x27;s method to measure the speed of light (see Fizeau&#x27;s measurement of the speed of light in air), introducing various improvements in the apparatus, which added greatly to the accuracy of the results. This achievement won for him, in 1878, the &quot;prix Lacaze&quot; and membership of the French Academy of Sciences (&quot;l&#x27;Académie des sciences&quot;), and the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society in England. In 1892, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1896, he became president of the French Academy of Sciences. Cornu was the President of the Société Astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1897-1899. In 1899, at the jubilee commemoration of Sir George Stokes, he was Rede lecturer at Cambridge, his subject being the wave theory of light and its influence on modern physics; and on that occasion the honorary degree of D.Sc. was conferred on him by the university. He died at Romorantin on 12 April 1902.

The Cornu spiral, a graphical device for the computation of light intensities in Fresnel&#x27;s model of near-field diffraction, is named after him. The spiral (or clothoid) is also used in geometric design of roads. The Cornu depolarizer is also named after him.

Cornu developed the theory of varied line-space diffraction gratings.

<text>Galton and Simpson were a British comedy scriptwriting duo, who wrote for radio, television and film, consisting of Ray Galton OBE (17 July 1930 – 5 October 2018) and Alan Simpson OBE (27 November 1929 – 8 February 2017). They are best known for their work with comedian Tony Hancock on radio and television between 1954 and 1961 and their long-running television situation comedy, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, eight series of which were aired between 1962 and 1974, they had an association lasting 60 years.

==Career==
Galton and Simpson met in 1948, while recuperating from tuberculosis at the Milford Hospital near Godalming in Surrey, The partnership&#x27;s break in comedy writing came with the Derek Roy vehicle &quot;Happy Go Lucky&quot;, although this was not a success. The Hancock connection began with their involvement with later radio variety series, and from November 1954 continued with &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; on radio; a series featuring their scripts for Hancock ran on television between 1956 and 1961. In October that year Hancock ended his professional relationship with the writers, and with Beryl Vertue who worked with the writers&#x27; at their agency Associated London Scripts. This writers&#x27; co-operative had been founded by Eric Sykes and Spike Milligan, with others involved, including Hancock for a time.

After their association with Hancock had ended, they wrote a series of &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; (1961–62), ten one-off half-hour plays for the BBC. One play in the series, &quot;The Offer&quot;, was well received, and from this emerged &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (1962–74), about two rag and bone men, father and son, who live together in a squalid house in West London. This was the basis for the American series &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; , the Dutch series &quot;Stiefbeen en Zoon&quot; and the Swedish series &quot;Albert &amp; Herbert&quot;.

Their comedy is characterised by a bleak and somewhat fatalistic tone. &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; in particular is, at times, extremely black comedy, and close in tone to social realist drama. Both the character played by Tony Hancock in &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; and Harold Steptoe (Harry H. Corbett) are pretentious, would-be intellectuals who find themselves trapped by the squalor of their lives. This theme had been expanded upon in their script for Tony Hancock&#x27;s film &quot;The Rebel&quot; (1961), about a civil servant who moves to Paris to become an artist. Gabriel Chevallier&#x27;s novel &quot;Clochemerle&quot; (1934) was adapted by Galton and Simpson as a BBC/West German co-production in 1972. They contributed the book to &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Journey&quot;, a musical accompaniment to a 1973 production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;, which was however soon dropped. Around this time an unbroadcast television pilot entitled &quot;Bunclarke With an E&quot; was recorded based on a &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; script, with Arthur Lowe and James Beck, but Beck died before the project could be developed as a series. Another series from this period, &quot;Casanova &#x27;73&quot; (1973) with Leslie Phillips in the lead, was described by &quot;The Times&quot; in its obituary of Galton as &quot;disappointingly typical of their later work.&quot;

While both writers continued to work after &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; ended, including several projects with Frankie Howerd, they had no further high-profile successes. Duncan Wood, the former &quot;Hancock&quot; and &quot;Steptoe&quot; producer by then at Yorkshire Television, commissioned &quot;The Galton &amp; Simpson Playhouse&quot;, a seven-part series broadcast in 1977, featuring leading actors of the time such as Richard Briers, Leonard Rossiter and Arthur Lowe. None of these shows led to another series. Simpson retired from scriptwriting in 1978, becoming an after-dinner speaker, while Galton collaborated in several projects with Johnny Speight.

In 1996 and 1997, comedian Paul Merton revived several &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; and other Galton and Simpson scripts for ITV to a mixed reception. Ray Galton&#x27;s &quot;Get Well Soon&quot;, based on his and Simpson&#x27;s early sanatorium experiences, was broadcast by the BBC in 1997.

In October 2005, Galton and John Antrobus premiered their play &quot;Steptoe and Son in Murder at Oil Drum Lane&quot; at the Theatre Royal, York. The play is set in the present day and relates the events that lead to Harold killing his father, and their eventual meeting thirty years later (Albert appearing as a ghost). A series of old plays updated for modern times, entitled &quot;Galton and Simpson&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 in 2009. The series of four episodes was made to celebrate the duo&#x27;s 60-year anniversary, and the cast consists of Frank Skinner, Mitchell and Webb, Rik Mayall, June Whitfield and Paul Merton. The successful Scandinavian television series &quot;Fleksnes Fataliteter&quot; and &quot;Albert &amp; Herbert&quot; were based on &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; and &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;.

==Awards==
Galton and Simpson were both awarded OBEs in the 2000 honours list for their contribution to British television.

On Saturday 1 June 2013, the British Comedy Society unveiled a blue plaque to Simpson and Galton at Milford Hospital (formerly the sanatorium at which the pair first met).

On 8 May 2016, the two men were awarded a BAFTA fellowship for their comedy writing.

<text>Raymond Percy Galton (17 July 1930 – 5 October 2018) was an English radio and television scriptwriter, best known for the Galton and Simpson comedy writing partnership with Alan Simpson. Together they devised and wrote 1950s and 60s BBC sitcoms including &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; (1954–1961), the first two series of &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; (1961–1963), and &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (1962–1974).

==Early life==
Galton was born in Paddington, West London, and after leaving school he worked for the Transport and General Workers Union. He contracted tuberculosis aged 18 in 1948 and was admitted to Milford Sanatorium near Godalming in Surrey, where he met fellow patient Alan Simpson.

==Galton and Simpson==
==Later career==
Alan Simpson retired from scriptwriting in 1978 to concentrate on his business interests. Galton then often worked with Johnny Speight on scripts, including &quot;Spooner&#x27;s Patch&quot; (1979–1982) about a corrupt police station. He also wrote scripts for sitcoms produced in Germany and Scandinavia. He co-wrote the ITV series &quot;Room at the Bottom&quot; (1986–1988) about television executives. His last sitcom was &quot;Get Well Soon&quot; in 1997 which he co-created with John Antrobus and which was based on his own experiences in a sanatorium. In October 2005, Galton and Antrobus premiered their play &quot;Steptoe and Son in Murder at Oil Drum Lane&quot; at the Theatre Royal, York. The play was set in the present day and related the events that led to Harold killing his father, and their eventual meeting thirty years later (Albert appearing as a ghost).

==Honours and awards==
Galton won two BAFTA awards among many others such as a British Comedy Award. 
He accepted an OBE in 2000 and he and Simpson received a BAFTA Fellowship on 8 May 2016.

==Personal life and death==
Galton married Tonia Phillips in 1956, and they had three children; she died from cancer in 1995. He died on 5 October 2018. Galton&#x27;s family said he died in his sleep at a family home after a long period suffering from dementia. 

His Manager Tessa Le Bars said in a statement “I have had the great honour of working with Ray for over 50 years and for the last 40 as his manager and friend. With his lifelong co-writer, the late Alan Simpson, they were regarded as the Fathers and creators of British sitcom. The end of an iconic era, but the legacy of Hancock’s Half Hour, Steptoe and Son and over 600 scripts is huge. They will endure, inspire and bring laughter to the nation for evermore&quot;.

<doc id="211469" wikidata="Q420841" url="?curid=211469" title="Australasian wren">
<text>The Australasian wrens are a family, Maluridae, of small, insectivorous passerine birds endemic to Australia and New Guinea. While commonly known as wrens, they are unrelated to the true wrens. The family comprises 32 species (including sixteen fairywrens, three emu-wrens, and thirteen grasswrens) in six genera.

==Taxonomy and systematics ==
As with many other Australian creatures, and perhaps more than most, the species making up this family were comprehensively misunderstood by early researchers. They were variously classified as Old World flycatchers, Old World warblers, and Old World babblers. In the late 1960s, morphological studies began to suggest that the Australo-Papuan fairywrens, the grasswrens, emu-wrens and two monotypic wren-like genera from New Guinea were related and, following Charles Sibley&#x27;s pioneering work on egg-white proteins in the mid-1970s, Australian researchers adopted the family name Maluridae in 1975.

With further morphological work and the great strides made in DNA analysis towards the end of the 20th century, their position became clear: the Maluridae are one of the many families to have emerged from the great corvid radiation in Australasia. Their closest relatives are the honeyeaters (Meliphagidae), and the pardalotes (Pardalotidae). Their obvious similarity to the wrens of Europe and America is not genetic, but simply the consequence of convergent evolution between more-or-less unrelated species that share the same ecological niche.

A 2011 analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the broad-billed fairywren and Campbell&#x27;s fairywren, both formerly lumped together in the genus &quot;Malurus,&quot; to lie in a clade with the two other monospecific New Guinea genera and as such, they were later re-classified as separate species within the genus &quot;Chenorhamphus&quot;.

Currently, there are 6 genera recognized:

Family Maluridae
* Subfamily Malurinae
** Tribe Malurini – fairywrens
***Genus &quot;Sipodotus &quot;– Wallace&#x27;s fairywren
***Genus &quot;Chenorhamphus&quot; – (2 species)
*** Genus &quot;Malurus&quot; – (12 species)
*** Genus &quot;Clytomyias&quot; – Orange-crowned fairywren
** Tribe Stipiturini
*** Genus &quot;Stipiturus&quot; – emu-wrens (3 species)
* Subfamily Amytornithinae
** Genus &quot;Amytornis&quot; – grasswrens (13 species)

==Description==
Malurids are small to medium birds, inhabiting a wide range of environments from rainforest to desert, although most species inhabit grassland or scrub. The grasswrens are well camouflaged with black and brown patterns, but other species often have brilliantly coloured plumage, especially in the males.

They are insectivorous, typically foraging in underbrush. They build domed nests in areas of dense vegetation, and it is not unusual for the young to remain in the nest and assist in raising chicks from later clutches.

Fairywrens are notable for several peculiar behavioral characteristics. They are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Males of several species pluck petals of conspicuous colours and display them to females for reasons unknown.

The song of fairywrens is pleasant and complex, and at least two species (the superb and splendid fairywren) possess, in addition to the alarm calls common toand universally understood bymost small birds, another vocalization used when confronted by predators. This, termed &quot;Type II Vocalization,&quot; is song-like and used when confronted by calling butcherbirds, and sometimes other predatory birds. Its purpose is, however, unknown; it does not seem to be a warning call.

<text>Mämmi (; ) is a traditional Finnish dessert, eaten around Easter.

Mämmi is traditionally made of water, rye flour, ground malted rye, salt, and dried, ground Seville orange zest. The mixture is then left to sweeten naturally, before being baked in an oven until set, by which time the colour and flavour has developed due to the Maillard reaction. After baking, the mämmi is chilled for three to four days before serving. Unlike traditional mämmi, which is left to sweeten naturally, commercially made mämmi is usually seasoned with dark molasses. Traditional mämmi has an aromatic and sweet flavour, consisting of just 2% sugar or less, whereas commercially produced mämmi can contain as much as 20% sugar and is therefore much different in flavour. Mämmi has up to 10% protein and is rich in trace elements. Traditionally, mämmi was stored in small boxes made of birch bark called &quot;tuokkonen&quot; or &quot;rove&quot;, the appearance of which is now mimicked by commercial packaging.

Typically, mämmi is eaten cold, with either milk or cream and sugar, and less commonly with vanilla sauce. Traditionally, it was also eaten on sliced bread as a spread. There is a Finnish society for mämmi founded by Ahmed Ladarsi, the former chef at the Italian Embassy in Helsinki, who has developed around fifty recipes containing mämmi. There are a number of websites with recipes using mämmi, most of them Finnish. Mämmi is also used as a minor ingredient in a mämmi beer by Laitilan Wirvoitusjuomatehdas.

==History==

Mämmi was first mentioned during the 16th century, in a dissertation (in Latin). It is claimed that it has been eaten in southwestern Finland ever since the 13th century. 

Today, Finns rarely make mämmi at home and most modern mämmi is factory-made. Traditional versions of mämmi are sold in Finland with the labels &quot;perinteinen&quot; (traditional) or &quot;luomu&quot; (organic). Some people of Finnish descent in North America and Australia still make mämmi at home.

<text>The Old World orioles (Oriolidae) are an Old World family of passerine birds. The family contains 41 species which are divided in 4 genera. The family includes two extinct species from New Zealand that are placed in the genus &quot;Turnagra&quot;.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The family Oriolidae comprises the piopios, figbirds, pitohuis and the Old World orioles. The piopios were added in 2011, having been formerly placed in the family Turnagridae. Several other genera have been proposed to split up the genus &quot;Oriolus&quot;. For example, the African black-headed species are sometimes placed in a separate genus, &quot;Baruffius&quot;. The family Oriolidae is not related to the New World orioles, despite their similar size, diet, behaviour and contrasting plumage patterns. Rather, these similarities are an example of convergent evolution.

=== Extant genera===
There are three extant genera in the family Oriolidae:
=== Extinct genera===
There are at least two extinct genera in the family Oriolidae:
* Genus &quot;Turnagra&quot; – piopios (2 extinct species)
* Genus &quot;Longmornis&quot; – &quot;Longmornis robustirostrata&quot;

==Description==
The orioles and figbirds are medium-sized passerines, around 20–30 cm in length, with the females only slightly smaller than the males. The beak is slightly curved and hooked, and, except in the figbirds, as long again as the head. The plumage of most species is bright and showy, although the females often have duller plumage than the males do. The plumage of many Australasian orioles mimics that of friarbirds (a genus of large honeyeaters), probably to reduce aggression against the smaller orioles.

==Distribution and habitat==
The family is distributed across Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The few temperate nesting species are migratory, and some tropical species also show seasonal movements.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
Orioles are monogamous, breeding in territorial pairs (although the Australasian figbird, and possibly also the other figbirds, breed in loose colonies). Nesting sites may be chosen near aggressive species such as shrikes, drongos or friarbirds, which confer a degree of protection. The nest is a deep woven cup suspended like a hammock from a branch. They usually lay two or three eggs, but as many as six have been recorded.

===Food and feeding===
Orioles are arboreal and tend to feed in the canopy. Many species are able to survive in open forests and woodlands, although a few are restricted to closed forest. They are opportunistic omnivores, with the main components of their diet being fruit, berries, arthropods, and nectar.

<doc id="211482" wikidata="Q601235" url="?curid=211482" title="Hip house">
<text>Hip house, also known as rap house or house rap, is a musical genre that mixes elements of house music and hip hop music, that originated in both London and Chicago in the mid-to-late 1980s.

A British collaboration between the electronic group Beatmasters and the rap duo Cookie Crew created &quot;Rok da House&quot;; possibly the first hip house single.

==History==
Minor controversy ensued in 1988 when a U.S. record called &quot;Turn Up the Bass&quot; by Tyree Cooper featuring Kool Rock Steady claimed it was the &quot;first hip house record on vinyl&quot;. The Beatmasters disputed this, pointing out that &quot;Rok da House&quot; had originally been written and pressed to vinyl in 1986. The outfit then released &quot;Who&#x27;s in the House?&quot; featuring British emcee Merlin, containing the lines &quot;Beatmasters stand to attention, hip house is your invention&quot; and &quot;Watch out Tyree, we come faster&quot;. More claims to the hip-house crown were subsequently laid down by Fast Eddie in &quot;Yo Yo Get Funky!&quot;, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock with &quot;It Takes Two&quot;, and Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s How I&#x27;m Living&quot;.

After successful releases by the Beatmasters, Deskee, Tyree, KC Flightt, Doug Lazy and Mr. Lee, hip-house became popular in the acid house warehouse scene and nightclubs. Hip house also garnered substantial chart success. The style complemented sample-based records of the period, produced by British artists such as S-Express, Bomb the Bass and MARRS.

Hip house tracks featured on popular dance compilations including Telstar&#x27;s &quot;Deep Heat&quot; compilation series and was championed by DJs such as Chad Jackson.

As house music emerged as a worldwide industry by the late 1980s, U.S. acts such as C+C Music Factory would use the hip house formula in hits such as &quot;Gonna Make You Sweat&quot;, as well as the Eurodance particularly with hits by the Belgian group Technotronic and the German groups Snap! and Real McCoy.

==Influence on UK rave scene==
Late 1980s hip house releases by UK artists such as Double Trouble and Rebel MC, Blapps Posse and Shut Up and Dance were an early influence towards the early 1990s UK rave scene and the breakbeat hardcore genre (and genres that developed from it such as jungle).

==Hip house in the present day==
A modern form of hip house became popular in the mid-2000s, known as electro hop, with artists enjoying mainstream success towards the end of the decade and into the 2010s. These artists included LMFAO, Pitbull (most notably with his albums &quot;Rebelution&quot; (2009) and &quot;Planet Pit&quot; (2011)), Flo Rida, Far East Movement, Hyper Crush, Example (described as &quot;rave-rap&quot; or &quot;rave-hop&quot;) and Azealia Banks. Electronic dance music DJs/producers also had hits in the genre, which featured vocals from rappers. These include &quot;C&#x27;mon (Catch &#x27;em by Surprise)&quot; by Tiësto and Diplo with Busta Rhymes, and &quot;Forever&quot; by Wolfgang Gartner and will.i.am. French DJ David Guetta had several hip house hits such as &quot;Memories&quot; with Kid Cudi, &quot;Where Them Girls At&quot; with Flo Rida and Nicki Minaj, &quot;Gettin&#x27; Over You&quot; with LMFAO and &quot;Little Bad Girl&quot; with Taio Cruz and Ludacris.

Hip house in the 2020s include &quot;Boss Bitch&quot; by Doja Cat, &quot;Ego Death&quot; by Ty Dolla Sign, &quot;My High&quot; by Disclosure, Aminé and Slowthai, &quot;Believe What I Say&quot; by Kanye West, &quot;Her&quot; by Megan Thee Stallion and &quot;Thique&quot; by Beyoncé.
