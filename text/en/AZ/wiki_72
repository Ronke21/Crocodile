<text>A motion or vote of no confidence (or the inverse, a motion and corresponding vote of confidence) is a motion and corresponding vote thereon in a deliberative assembly (usually a legislative body) as to whether an officer (typically an executive) is deemed fit to continue to occupy their office. The no-confidence vote is a defining constitutional element of a parliamentary system, in which the government&#x27;s/executive&#x27;s mandate rests upon the continued support (or at least non-opposition) of the majority in the legislature. Systems differ in whether such a motion may be directed against the prime minister, against the Government (this could be a Majority government or a Minority government/Coalition government), against individual cabinet ministers, against the cabinet as a whole, or some combination of the above.

A censure motion is different from a no-confidence motion. In a parliamentary system, a vote of no confidence leads to the resignation of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, or, depending on the constitutional procedure at hand, a snap election to potentially replace the government.

A vote in favour of censure is a non-constitutionally-binding expression of disapproval; a motion of censure may be against an individual minister or a group of ministers. Depending on a country&#x27;s constitution, a no-confidence motion may be directed against the entire cabinet. Depending on the applicable rules, a mover of a censure motion may need to state the reasons for the motion, but specific reasons may not be required for no-confidence motions. However, in some countries, especially those with uncodified constitutions, what constitutes a no-confidence vote sufficient to force the resignation of high officeholders may not be clear. Even if the government is not constitutionally bound to resign after losing a given vote, such a result may be taken as an ominous sign for the government and may prompt its resignation or the calling of a snap election.

In addition to explicit motions of confidence and no-confidence, some bills (almost always the government budget and sometimes other key pieces of legislation) may be declared to be a confidence vote – that is, the vote on the bill is treated as a question of confidence in the government; a defeat of the bill expresses no confidence in the government and may cause the resignation of the Prime Minister and Cabinet or the calling of an election.

==Parliamentary systems==
There are a number of variations in this procedure between parliaments. In some countries, a motion of no confidence can be directed at the government collectively or at any individual member, including the prime minister. Sometimes, motions of confidence or no confidence are proposed even though it is clear that the government does in fact have majority support simply to pressure ministers or put opposition parties in the potentially-embarrassing situation of voting in support of the government.

In many parliamentary democracies, there are limits to how often a confidence vote may be held, such as being allowed only once every three or six months. Thus, the timing of a motion of no confidence is a matter of political judgment. A motion of no confidence on a relatively trivial matter may then prove counterproductive if an issue suddenly arises that is seen to be a more credible justification for a motion of no confidence.

Sometimes, the government chooses to declare that one of its bills is a &quot;vote of confidence&quot; to prevent dissident members of its own party from voting against it. However, this is a political risk, especially when the Prime Minister&#x27;s majority is not assured, such as if the ruling party/coalition is internally divided, or in minority government; if the bill fails (and thus it is shown that parliament has lost its confidence in the government), the Prime Minister is expected to resign or call snap elections. In Westminster systems, the government budget is always a vote of confidence; even a successful amendment to the budget may be considered a no-confidence vote.

It is not necessarily the case that a vote with the effect of a motion of no confidence be introduced as such. As stated above, certain pieces of legislation may be treated as confidence issues. In some cases, the motion may be an ordinary legislative or procedural matter of little substantive importance used for the purpose of testing the government&#x27;s majority, such as the 1895 vote of no confidence in the Earl of Rosebery&#x27;s government, which was technically a motion to reduce the salary of a minister by a nominal sum.

===Australia===
In the Australian Parliament, a motion of no confidence requires a majority of the members present in the House of Representatives to agree to it. The House of Representatives has 151 members and so requires 76 votes in favour of the motion when all members of the House are present. A straight vote of no confidence in the Australian government and a motion or amendment censuring a government have never been successful in the House of Representatives. However, governments have on eight occasions resigned or advised a dissolution after their defeat on other questions before the House. The last time that a government resigned after being defeated in the House came in October 1941, when the House rejected the budget of Arthur Fadden&#x27;s minority government.

Specific motions of no confidence or censure against the prime minister, ministers, the leader of the opposition, senators and leaders of political parties have been successful on some occasions. Motions of no confidence against the government may be passed in the Senate but have little or no impact in the House. However, the Senate&#x27;s right to refuse supply helped spark the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis.

===Bangladesh===
In the Parliament of Bangladesh, there is no provision to hold motions of no confidence, as a result of Article 70 of the Constitution of Bangladesh, which prohibits members of Parliament from voting against their party and made the removal of a sitting government unattainable.

===Canada===
In Canada, a vote of no confidence is a motion that the House of Commons (federal) or legislative assembly (provincial) no longer has confidence in the incumbent government. A no-confidence motion may be directed against only the incumbent government, with confidence motions against the Official Opposition being inadmissible. Originating as a constitutional convention, it remains an uncodified practice which is not outlined in any standing orders for the House of Commons.

In the House of Commons, a member of parliament may introduce a motion that explicitly states the House has no confidence in the incumbent government. In addition to explicit motions of no confidence, several other motions and bills are also considered implicit motions of confidence, and a vote of no confidence may be asserted automatically if such a bill fails to pass. Bills and motions that are considered implicit motions of confidence include appropriations or supply bills, motions concerning budgetary policy, and the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. The government may also declare any bill or motion to be a question of confidence. Although the failure to pass those bills and motions can serve as an implicit expression of a vote of no confidence, the opposition is not required to formally present this failure as a motion of no-confidence against the government.

If a vote of no confidence passes, the prime minister is required to either resign or request the governor-general to dissolve parliament and call a general election. The governor-general may refuse a request for dissolution if an election has recently been held or there is another leader who can likely gain the confidence of the House. If a dissolution request is refused, the prime minister must resign, and the governor-general invites the leader of another coalition/party to form a new government. Six motions of no confidence have been passed in the House of Commons: in 1926, 1963, 1974, 1979, 2005, and 2011. All successful votes of no confidence in the 20th century were the result of a loss of supply; votes of no confidence in 2005 and 2011 were the result of explicit confidence motions presented by the opposition.

In 1968, the standing orders respecting supply were amended to limit opposition to two confidence motions on a given opposition day in each of the three supply periods. This provision was repealed in June 1985.

In 1984, a proposal was made to consider the election of speaker to not be a matter of confidence. This was passed in 1985 and is now part of the standing orders.

The confidence convention is also present in the provincial legislatures of Canada, operating much like their federal counterpart. However, the decision to dissolve the legislature and call an election or to see if another coalition/party can form a government is left to the provincial lieutenant-governor.

Two Canadian territories, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, operate as a consensus government system in which the premier is chosen by the members of the nonpartisan legislature. If a vote of no confidence against the incumbent government passes, the premier and the cabinet are removed from office, and the legislature elects a new premier. In a consensus government, confidence motions may be directed against any individual ministers holding office as they are also nominated by members of the legislature.

=== Czech Republic ===

The Constitution of the Czech Republic provides for a government responsible to the Chamber of Deputies (the lower chamber of the Czech parliament). Any new government, appointed after the demise of previous one, must—no more than 30 days after being appointed by the president of the republic—request a motion of confidence vote from the Chamber of Deputies. The motion of confidence is passed if more deputies vote for the government than against it. Otherwise, the government must resign and the president can appoint a new government. If this government also fails to gain confidence, then the President of the republic must appoint a prime minister proposed by the president of the Chamber of Deputies. If this government still fails to gain confidence of the Chamber, then the president of the republic may choose either to again appoint a prime minister of his choice (the government still need to pass motion of confidence) or to order the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies and set new elections.

The government can at any time ask the Chamber of Deputies for a vote of confidence. The government can also connect voting on a government-sponsored bill with a request for a vote of confidence. If the bill fails to pass in Chamber of Deputies it is equivalent to a lost vote of confidence. In this case, the Chamber has to vote on the proposed bill within three months of its submission (otherwise the president of the republic can dissolve it).

The Chamber of Deputies may itself start debate on a vote of no confidence in the government, but only if it has been submitted in writing by at least fifty Deputies. To adopt the resolution, an absolute majority of all Deputies have to vote against the government.

=== Denmark ===
Paragraph 15 of the Danish Constitution states that &quot;A Minister shall not remain in office after the Folketing has passed a vote of no confidence in him&quot; and that &quot;When the Folketing passes a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, he shall ask for the dismissal of the Ministry unless writs are to be issued for a general election.&quot; The vote requires a simple majority.

Votes of no confidence against the government are rare in Denmark, only occurring in 1909, 1947 and 1975. Generally the government will resign or call for an election before a vote of no confidence.

===European Union===
The European Parliament can dismiss the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, through a successful motion of no confidence, which requires a two-thirds vote. A successful vote on the motion leads to the resignation of the entire Commission.

===Germany===

In Germany, a vote of no confidence in the federal chancellor requires the opposition, on the same ballot, to propose a candidate of its own whom it wants the federal president to appoint as its successor. Thus, a motion of no confidence may be brought forward only if there is a positive majority for the new candidate. The idea was to prevent the state crises that occurred near the end of the German Weimar Republic. Frequently, chancellors were then turned out of the office without their successors having enough parliamentary support to govern. Unlike the British system, chancellors do not have to resign in response to the failure of a vote of confidence if it has been initiated by them, rather than by the parliamentary opposition, but they may ask the president to call general elections, a request that the president decides on whether to fulfil.

===Greece===
The Parliament may, by its decision, withdraw its confidence from the Government or from a member of it. A motion of no confidence can only be submitted six months after the Parliament has rejected a previous one. The motion must be signed by at least one-sixth of the members and must clearly state the issues to be debated. A motion of no confidence is accepted only if it is approved by the absolute majority of the total number of members.

===India===

In India, a motion of no confidence can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Parliament of India) and after at least 50 Lok Sabha members support it, the Speaker may grant a leave and after considering the state of business in the House, allot a day or days or part of a day for the discussion of the motion (under sub-rule (2) and (3) of rule 198 of Lok Sabha Rules, 16th edition). If the motion carries, the House debates and votes on the motion. If a majority of the members vote in favour of the motion, it is passed, and all the ministers are expected to resign on their moral grounds.

J. B. Kripalani moved the first-ever no-confidence motion on the floor of the Lok Sabha against the government of prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in August 1963, immediately after the disastrous Sino-Indian War. As of August 2023, 31 no-confidence motions have been moved. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi faced the most no-confidence motions (15), followed by Lal Bahadur Shastri and P. V. Narasimha Rao (three each), Morarji Desai and Narendra Modi (two each), and Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajiv Gandhi, V. P. Singh, H. D. Deve Gowda, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and Manmohan Singh (one each). Prime Minister Vajpayee lost the no-confidence motion by a margin of one vote (269–270) in April 1999. Prime Minister Desai resigned on 12 July 1979 after being defeated in a vote of no-confidence, V. P. Singh and H. D. Deve Gowda were also removed in no-confidence motion. The two most recent no-confidence motion were against the Narendra Modi government, in 2018 and in 2023, both of which were failed in the Lok Sabha.

Even after the Anti-Defection Law, when the majority party has an absolute majority and it can whip party members to vote in favour of the government; still it is possible to remove the government by a no-confidence motion if the ruling party breaks by more than one third.

===Ireland===

In Ireland, if a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach or the government of Ireland is passed by Dáil Éireann, then the Taoiseach may request that the President dissolve the Dáil and call a general election. Whether or not to grant this request is at the discretion of the President, though no President has ever refused a request for dissolution. Should the President refuse to dissolve the Dáil, the Taoiseach and government must resign.

===Israel===
The motion of no confidence is outlined in Israeli Basic Law Article 28 and Article 44 of the Knesset&#x27;s Rule of Procedure.

===Italy===
In Italy, the government requires the support of both houses of Parliament. Within ten days of the government&#x27;s formation, a confidence motion must be passed. Five governments were forced to resign when a motion of confidence in them failed to pass in one of the houses of Parliament: the eighth De Gasperi cabinet in 1953, the first Fanfani cabinet in 1954, the first Andreotti cabinet in 1972, the fifth Andreotti cabinet in 1979 and the seventh Fanfani cabinet in 1987.

Parliament can withdraw its support to the government through a vote of no confidence. A vote of no confidence may be proposed if a tenth of the members of either house sign the proposition and within three days before the appointed date, the vote can be brought into the discussion.

Since the drafting of the Constitution of Italy, Parliament has not passed any no confidence motion against the whole cabinet, as government crises often ended with prime ministers resigning after becoming aware the majority of parliament did not support them anymore, before a no confidence motion could be put to vote or even before such a motion was presented. The only time this instrument was used was in October 1995, when the minister of justice Filippo Mancuso was forced to resign after a vote of no confidence against him passed in the Senate. The subsequent Constitutional Court sentence in 1996 declared it was indeed possible to propose an individual vote of no confidence against a single minister, instead of the whole government, and that as such, the motion Mancuso was legitimate.

The government can also make any vote a matter of confidence. In the entire history of the Republic of Italy, only two governments were forced to resign when a vote they had made a matter of confidence failed: the first Prodi cabinet in 1996, and the second Prodi cabinet in 2006. In both cases, the vote made a matter of confidence was a vote on a resolution approving the prime minister&#x27;s address to one of the houses of Parliament.

===Japan===
Article 69 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan provides that &quot;if the House of Representatives passes a non-confidence resolution, or rejects a confidence resolution, the Cabinet shall resign en masse, unless the House of Representatives is dissolved within ten (10) days.&quot;

=== Malaysia ===
In Malaysia&#x27;s federal political system, votes of confidence in state legislative assemblies of Malaysia have removed its heads of state governments four times, most recently Faizal Azumu&#x27;s Perak ministry in 2020. During the 2020–2022 Malaysian political crisis, opposition members of Parliament demanded a vote of confidence in Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, but he resigned before this could take place.

===Pakistan===
The Constitution of Pakistan has provision for a no-confidence motion in all constituents of the Electoral College of the state. The motions can target speakers and deputy speakers of provincial and national assemblies, the prime minister, chief ministers of provinces, as well as the chairman and deputy chairman of Senate. Before it can be put for a vote on the pertinent house&#x27;s floor, it must have the backing of at least 20% of the elected members in all cases except those moved against speakers or deputy speakers in which case there is no minimum. After being put to vote, the motion is deemed to be successful only if passed by a majority.

The no-confidence procedure has historically been mostly used to remove speakers and deputy speakers. Of the 11 times that the motion has been invoked, nine cases targeted those posts, with four being effective. Votes of no confidence in prime ministers are extremely rare. In November 1989, Benazir Bhutto faced an ultimately unsuccessful motion of no confidence by Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi. Same is the case for provincial chief ministers, as the only instance of its use is the one moved in January 2018 against Sanaullah Zehri, the chief minister of Balochistan, who resigned before the vote could take place.

Since gaining independence in 1947, only Imran Khan was successfully removed as prime minister through a motion of no confidence in 2022. An earlier attempt led by the opposition was dismissed by the deputy speaker Qasim Suri using Article 5 of the constitution. Later on, President Arif Alvi dissolved the National Assembly immediately after receiving advice from Prime Minister Khan to do so, causing a constitutional crisis. On 7 April 2022, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that the dismissal of the no-confidence motion, the prorogation of the National Assembly, advice of Khan to president Arif Alvi to dissolve the National Assembly and subsequent dissolution of the National Assembly were unconstitutional, and overturned these actions. On 10 April 2022, the reconvened National Assembly passed the motion of no confidence against Khan by a majority vote of 172, being the first successful ousting through no–confidence motion.

===Peru===
In Peru, both the legislative and the executive branches have the power to bring a motion of no confidence against acting legal members of the other branch. The president of the Cabinet may propose a motion of no confidence against any minister to Congress, which then needs more than half the Congress to approve it. The president of the republic may dissolve Congress if it has censured or denied its confidence to two Cabinets. The relevant Articles 132–134 are in the 1993 version of the Constitution of Peru.

During the 2019 Peruvian constitutional crisis, President Martín Vizcarra enacted a constitutional process on 29 May 2019 to create a motion of no confidence towards Congress if it refused to co-operate with his proposed actions against corruption. Pedro Castillo also motioned to use this mechanism against Congress in 2022 when he attempted to dissolve the legislative body. The Congressionally-appointed Constitutional Court of Peru, during the presidency of Castillo, would rule that only Congress could interpret whether or not a motion of confidence has been made.

=== Poland ===

The Constitution of Poland (1997) provides for government responsible to the Sejm (lower chamber of the Parliament of Poland). The President of the Republic has no more than 14 days after the dismissal of the old government or after the first sitting of the newly elected Sejm, to appoint a prime minister and on his recommendation other members of the government (prime minister has to submit resignation of the current sitting government at first sitting of the newly elected Sejm). 14 days after being appointed by the president, the government has to present their programme to the Sejm and ask for a motion requiring a vote of confidence. Motion is passed if more present Sejm deputies vote for the new government than against it. At least half of all Deputies have to be present. If the government fails to pass the vote of confidence (or if the president failed to appoint a new government in time) then the President of Sejm nominates a prime minister and government which has to also pass the vote of confidence. If the vote of confidence was successful, the president of the republic has to formally appoint this government. Otherwise the president may nominate members of the government as in the first instance. If even this time government fails to pass the vote of confidence, then the President of the Republic has to call a new parliamentary election.

Prime minister can ask the Sejm for a vote of confidence.

Government as whole but also individual ministers (for their ministry) are responsible to the Sejm. Sejm can by constructive vote of no confidence replace the prime minister and the current sitting government. In order for a motion of no confidence to pass and remove the government the Sejm has to vote for a new prime minister with a majority of all of its Deputies. Vote of no confidence against the sitting government can only be called if it is requested by at least 46 Deputies and if it&#x27;s called at least 3 months before the last motion was rejected. Exceptions apply for a motion requested by at least 115 Deputies.

The Sejm may also pass a vote of no confidence in an individual minister. This motion can be called if at least 69 Deputies requested it. Same voting procedure as for vote of no confidence of whole government apply. 
The President of the Republic has to recall a minister who failed to pass vote of no confidence. 

===South Africa===
Any member of Parliament in the National Assembly may request a motion of no confidence in either the Cabinet, excluding the president, or the president. The Speaker, within the rules of Parliament, must add such a motion to the order paper and give it a priority. If a motion of no confidence cannot be scheduled by the last sitting day of the annual sitting, it must be the first item on the order paper of the next sitting. In the event of a successful motion, the Speaker automatically assumes the position of acting president.

On 7 August 2017, Speaker Baleka Mbete announced that she would permit a motion of no confidence in Jacob Zuma&#x27;s government to proceed in the National Assembly via secret ballot. It was the eighth motion to be brought against Zuma in his presidency and the first to be held via secret ballot. After the vote was held the next day, the motion was defeated 198–177, with 25 abstentions. Around 20 governing ANC members of Parliament voted in favour of the measure.

===Spain===

The Spanish Constitution of 1978 provides for motions of no confidence to be proposed by one-tenth of the Congress of Deputies. Following the German model, votes of no confidence in Spain are constructive and so the motion must also include an alternative candidate for prime minister. For a motion of no confidence to be successful, it has to be carried by an absolute majority in the Congress of Deputies. At least five days must pass after the motion is registered before it can come up for a vote. Other parties may submit alternative motions within two days of the registration.

Also, the prime minister is barred from dissolving the Cortes Generales and calling a general election while a motion of no confidence is pending. If the motion is successful, the incumbent prime minister must resign. According to the Constitution, the replacement candidate named in the motion is automatically deemed to have the confidence of the Congress of Deputies and is immediately appointed as prime minister by the monarch. If the motion is unsuccessful, its signatories may not submit another motion during the same session.

The current prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, was sworn in on 2 June 2018 after a motion of no confidence against Mariano Rajoy had been approved on 1 June 2018.

===Singapore===
Under Article 25(1) of the Constitution of Singapore, the prime minister of Singapore must command the confidence of Parliament less NCMPs and NMPs. Since Singapore&#x27;s independence on 9 August 1965, no Singaporean government has ever faced a motion of no confidence. However, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew faced three no-confidence motions in 1961, 1962 and 1963, all prior to independence.

The 1960s saw the ruling PAP split between the right wing led by Lee Kuan Yew and the left wing led by Lim Chin Siong. This caused PAP&#x27;s massive majority to diminish. Lee Kuan Yew faced his first confidence vote on 20 July 1961 following the PAP&#x27;s defeat in the Hong Lim and Anson by-elections. This motion was rather a motion of confidence tabled by the Prime Minister himself. All 51 assemblymen were present and voting. The Prime Minister won the vote by a margin of 27–8 votes. The results were as follows:

However, among the 16 abstentions were 13 left wing PAP members, who were expelled from the PAP after the vote, and the 13 went on to form the Barisan Sosialis. On 13 July 1962, Barisan MP Lee Siew Choh tabled a motion of no confidence against Lee Kuan Yew. Three assemblymen were absent bringing the total membership of the Legislative Assembly to 48 present and voting. The Prime Minister won the vote by 24–16. Therefore, Lee Kuan Yew remained in office. The results for this motion of no confidence are as follows:

Lee Siew Choh tabled another motion of no confidence against Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s government on 15 June 1963 over issues regarding the proposed merger of Singapore into the Federation of Malaysia. Five members were absent from the Assembly and 1 seat was vacant bringing the total membership down to 45 present and voting. This time, Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s Government won the vote by a margin of 23–16. The results are as follows:

In September 1963, the Legislative Assembly was dissolved and fresh elections were called. The rump PAP won the election with a two-thirds majority therefore staving off any further attempts by the Barisan Sosialis to move further motions of no confidence. Following merger and separation (1963–1965), and with Barisan&#x27;s boycott of Parliament, the PAP was the dominant party in Parliament and motions of no confidence became &quot;rare&quot;, in fact &quot;non-existent&quot;. Further, Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s 1961 motion of confidence remains the only time that a Singaporean prime minister has ever tabled a motion of confidence in his own government.

===Sweden===
A motion of no confidence may be levelled against either the prime minister on behalf of the entire Swedish government or against an individual lower-level minister. At least 35 members of parliament (MPs) must support a proposal to initiate such a vote. A majority of MPs (175 members) must vote for a motion of no confidence for it to be successful. An individual minister who loses a confidence vote must resign. If a prime minister loses a no-confidence vote, the entire government must resign. The speaker may allow the ousted prime minister to head a transitional or caretaker government until Parliament elects a new prime minister.

Under the principle of negative parliamentarism, a prime ministerial candidate nominated by the Speaker does not need the confidence of a majority of MPs to be elected. However, a majority of MPs must not vote against the candidate, which renders prime ministerial votes similar to no-confidence votes. That means that a prime ministerial candidate, to be successful in the parliamentary vote, must have at least a total of 175 votes in favour or abstention. If a Speaker fails four times to have a nominee elected, an election must be held within three months of the final vote.

===United Kingdom===
Traditionally, in the Westminster system, the defeat of a supply bill, which concerns the spending of money, is seen to require automatically for the government to resign or ask for a new election, much like a no-confidence vote. A government in a Westminster system that cannot spend money is hamstrung, which is also called a loss of supply.

One of the most famous motions of no-confidence in British history was against James Callaghan who lost a motion of no-confidence by just one vote (311–310). There are other, failed motions of no confidence such as that of Theresa May which was defeated by a narrow margin of 325–306, and that of Boris Johnson which was defeated by a greater margin (347–238).

In the British Parliament, a no-confidence motion generally first appeared as an early day motion although the vote on the Speech from the Throne was also a confidence motion. However, from 2011 to 2022, under the then-Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, only a motion explicitly resolving that &quot;this House has no confidence in His Majesty&#x27;s Government&quot; was treated as a motion of no confidence. In 2022 the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 was repealed by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022.

==Semi-presidential systems==
In semi-presidential systems, the legislature may occasionally pass motions of no confidence, which removes only the cabinet and the prime minister. The legislature may also have the power to impeach an executive or judicial officer, with another institution or the legislature removing the officer from their office.

===France===

In France, the conditions under which the National Assembly, the lower house of the French Parliament, can bring down the government through a motion of no-confidence are outlined in paragraphs 2 and 3 of article 49 of the Constitution of the Fifth Republic: 
* a spontaneous motion of no-confidence (article 49.2)
** requires the sponsoring of 58 MPs (a tenth of the total number of lawmakers) to be tabled;
** is debated and voted upon at least 48 hours after it has been tabled;
** needs the backing of an absolute majority of the National Assembly members (normally 289 out of 577) to be passed;
** an MP cannot sponsor more than three different spontaneous motions of no-confidence per regular parliamentary session and no more than one per extraordinary parliamentary session.
* a motion of no-confidence in response to the Council of Ministers&#x27; decision to push a bill through without a vote (article 49.3)
** same conditions to be tabled and passed than those outlined in article 49.2;
** no numerical limits set on the MPs&#x27; ability to sponsor such a motion.

In both cases, if the motion succeeds, the prime minister is required to tender their government&#x27;s resignation to the President.

In the particular case of a motion of no-confidence tabled in response to the government&#x27;s pushing a bill through without a vote under the provisions of article 49.3, if the motion succeeds, the bill on which the cabinet has committed its responsibility is defeated and the government falls.

Two motions of no-confidence have been passed since the start of the Fifth Republic in 1958: one in 1962, and a second in 2024.
*In 1962, a spontaneous motion of no-confidence under article 49.2 was tabled against the Pompidou government over a constitutional reform dispute. The Assembly passed the motion on 5 October 1962, by 280 votes (the absolute majority required was 241 at that time). President de Gaulle refused to accept PM Pompidou&#x27;s resignation, instead dissolving the National Assembly and calling a snap election that resulted in an increased majority for his government.
* a motion of no-confidence under article 49.3 was passed against the Barnier on 4 December 2024 by 331 votes (required majority of 288). In accordance with the Constitution, Barnier resigned as Prime Minister on 5 December and the 2025 Social Security budget bill, on which the PM resorted to the special constitutional power, was defeated without a vote.

During the Third Republic, members of both the Senate and Chamber of Deputies could, with a simple interpellation and a vote, force the government into resigning, creating instability. The Fourth Republic introduced the censure motion with the majority of the membership needed to pass to replace interpellation, and removed the option of initiative by the Senate. Nevertheless, instability continued. According to historian René Rémond, President of the Council Paul Ramadier set up a precedent by submitting the composition of his government to a confidence vote after an interpellation by a deputy, despite the constitution not mentioning this process, thus recreating the problem of the preceding republic. The Fifth Republic restricted again the conditions of the motion by counting only the votes in favor of the deposition of the government, one tenth of the Assembly&#x27;s membership (58 deputies) being now needed to issue such motion according to Article 49 of the constitution. Article 27 allows lawmakers to delegate their votes for the no-confidence motion if they are not available the day of the open ballot.

===Russia===
In Russia, the lower house of the Federal Assembly (the State Duma) may by a simple majority (at least 226 votes out of 450) pass a motion of no confidence against the government of Russia as a whole. In that case, the matter goes for consideration of the Russian president, who may choose to dismiss the cabinet, which he can do anyway anytime at his own discretion, or just ignore the Duma&#x27;s decision. If the Duma passes a second motion of no confidence against the same composition of the cabinet within three months, the president is forced to make a concrete decision on whether to dismiss the government or to dissolve the Duma itself and call for new general elections. The State Duma may not be dissolved on those grounds if it was elected less than a year earlier, if it has already initiated impeachment proceedings against the president himself by bringing respective accusations, if less than six months remain left until presidential elections, or if there is a state of emergency or martial law throughout the whole territory of Russia. In the above-mentioned cases, the president is then effectively forced to dismiss the government.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, the Parliament of Sri Lanka may pass a motion of no confidence against the Sri Lankan government. In that case, the government is removed from power and the president of Sri Lanka has to appoint a new prime minister, who has to form a new government.

==Presidential systems==
Presidential systems with a robust separation of powers and/or fixed election dates generally do not use motions of no confidence and instead use impeachment as a similar mechanism.

===United States===
A motion to vacate in the United States House of Representatives can be used to remove the Speaker of the House. The first successful such motion at the federal level (the ouster of Kevin McCarthy in October 2023) was referred to informally as a &quot;no confidence vote&quot; in media reports covering the event.

The consequences of the Speaker being removed are generally not comparable to the effect of a motion of non-confidence in Westminster parliamentary systems. The President, as the head of government, is not affected; there are no changes to the Cabinet or individual executive positions, which are separated from the legislature; there is no change to the party alignments in the House of Representatives (as the removed Speaker retains the congressional seat); and there are no new elections immediately after a successful motion to vacate, since Congressional elections are set in the Constitution for every two years, regardless of any other circumstances. There is no means to dissolve the House of Representatives as a whole in the way a motion of no confidence often leads to. Thus, the most meaningful consequence of a Speaker&#x27;s removal that could be compared to a Westminster no confidence vote is the possibility of a change in legislative priorities, these being largely set by the Speaker in the U.S. House, as opposed to by a Prime Minister in the Westminster system.

While the President and Cabinet members can be removed and disqualified from office through impeachment by the House and conviction in the Senate, this is not considered a no confidence vote, since impeachment can only be invoked in the case of a crime.

Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides a framework for a motion of no confidence against the President of the United States, intended to be used in the event of the President&#x27;s incapacitation, but vaguely worded to be applicable in any example of inability to perform the job. The initial motion is issued by the Vice President and a majority of the president&#x27;s Cabinet, at which point the President is suspended from duty and the Vice President becomes acting President; if the President objects to the motion, a second motion of no confidence must be issued, then approved by two-thirds of both the House and the Senate within three weeks of the second motion, to become permanent. To date, the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which was originally ratified in 1967, has never been invoked.

==History==

The first motion of no confidence against an entire government occurred in March 1782 when, following news of the British defeat at Yorktown in the American Revolutionary War the previous October, the Parliament of Great Britain voted that it &quot;can no longer repose confidence in the present ministers&quot;. British Prime Minister Lord North responded by asking King George III to accept his resignation. That did not immediately create a constitutional convention. Although it is considered the first formal motion of no confidence, Sir Robert Walpole&#x27;s resignation after a defeat on a vote in the House of Commons in 1742 is considered to be the first &quot;de facto&quot; motion of no confidence.

During the early 19th century, attempts by prime ministers, such as Robert Peel, to govern in the absence of a parliamentary majority proved unsuccessful, and by the mid-19th century, the power of a motion of no confidence to break a government was firmly established in the UK.

In the United Kingdom, 11 prime ministers have been defeated through a no-confidence motion, but there has been only one such defeat since 1925, in the 1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry against James Callaghan.

In modern times, the passage of a motion of no confidence is a relatively rare event in two-party democracies. In almost all cases, party discipline is sufficient to allow a majority party to defeat a motion of no confidence, and if faced with possible defections in the government party, the government is likely to change its policies, rather than lose a vote of no confidence. The cases in which a motion of no confidence has passed are generally those in which the government party&#x27;s slim majority has been eliminated by either by-elections or defections, such as the 1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry in the UK which was carried by one vote and forced a general election, which was won by Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative Party.

Motions of no confidence are far more common in multi-party systems in which a minority party must form a coalition government. That can mean that there have been many short-lived governments because the party structure allows small parties to defeat a government which does not have the majority needed to create a government. This has widely been regarded as the cause of instability for the French Fourth Republic and the German Weimar Republic. More recent examples have been in Italy between the 1950s and 1990s, Israel, and Japan.

To deal with that situation, the French placed a greater degree of executive power in the office of the French president, along with a two-round plurality voting system, which makes it easier to form a stable majority government. Furthermore, since 2014, the French president can be impeached only if three conditions are fulfilled: one of the Houses of the French parliament must adopt a sitting in High Court proposal with a two-third majority, then the other house has to follow suit in a 15-day period, then two third of the members of the High Court have to vote in favor of the president&#x27;s impeachment during a one-month period where the Court must decide. The president can still pursue the exercise of his functions during the process.

In 2008, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, leading a minority government, requested Governor General Michaëlle Jean to prorogue Parliament. The prorogation delayed a potential no-confidence motion presented by the opposition. (See 2008–2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute.) Three years later, in 2011, Harper&#x27;s minority government was defeated by a motion of no confidence, which declared the government to be in contempt of Parliament and led to an election that year.

In 2013, during the Euromaidan pro-European riots, the opposition in Ukraine called for a motion of no confidence against the Cabinet of Ministers, led by the pro-Russian and eurosceptic Prime Minister Mykola Azarov. At least 226 votes were needed to gain a majority in Ukraine&#x27;s Verkhovna Rada. However, it fell 40 votes short, and Azarov&#x27;s government prevailed.

On 1 June 2018, in Spain, the government of Mariano Rajoy was ousted after a motion of no confidence passed 180–169 after the sentence of the Gürtel corruption scandal, which involved the ruling party. Pedro Sánchez was sworn in as the new Spanish prime minister. That was the first time in the history of Spain that a vote of no confidence resulted in a change of government.

On 25 September 2018, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven was ousted after he lost a vote of no confidence in the Riksdag after an election was held on 9 September. The center-left bloc led by Löfven&#x27;s Social Democratic Party won only 144 seats in parliament, 31 seats short of an absolute majority, and just one seat more than the opposition Alliance for Sweden bloc. The Sweden Democrats, having just won 62 seats, also voted with the main opposition bloc&#x27;s motion of no confidence.

On 8 March 2022, opposition parties filed the motion against then prime minister of Pakistan Imran Khan. Out of 346, 172 votes have required to gain the majority in national assembly of Pakistan. On 10 April 2022, motion of no confidence was passed by 174 votes out of 346. This was the first time in the history of Pakistan that vote of no confidence resulted in a change of government.

*January 30 – Romney Literary Society is established in the United States as the Polemic Society of Romney, West Virginia.
*April – John Keats begins his &quot;Great Year&quot; or &quot;Living Year&quot;, during which he is at his most productive, having given up work at Guy&#x27;s Hospital and moved into a new house, Wentworth Place, on Hampstead Heath on the edge of London. On April 3, Charles Wentworth Dilke lets his house, next door to Keats, to Mrs Brawne, whose daughter Fanny would become the love of Keats&#x27;s life. Between April 21 and the end of May Keats writes &quot;La Belle Dame sans Merci&quot; and most of his major odes: &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot;, &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;, &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot; and &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot;. In the summer he writes &quot;Lamia&quot;; on September 19 he writes his ode &quot;To Autumn&quot; at Winchester; and on October 19 proposes marriage to Fanny.

*April 1 – In London &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot; publishes John Polidori&#x27;s Gothic fiction &quot;The Vampyre&quot;, the first significant piece of prose vampire literature in English, attributing it to Lord Byron (who partly inspired it). It is first published in book form later in the year.
*June 21 – Walter Scott&#x27;s historical Waverley Novels &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot; and &quot;A Legend of Montrose&quot; are published anonymously by Archibald Constable in Edinburgh as the 3rd series of Scott&#x27;s Tales of My Landlord. They have been partly dictated due to Scott&#x27;s suffering from biliary colic earlier in the year.
*June 23 – Washington Irving begins publishing &quot;The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.&quot; in seven installments — the first including &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; and a later one including &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; — simultaneously in New York and London (where Irving is living at this time).
*August 16 – The Peterloo Massacre takes place in England, inspiring Percy Bysshe Shelley, in Italy, who, like Keats, has one of his most productive years. After hearing the news on September 5 he writes &quot;The Masque of Anarchy&quot; and sends it to a newspaper (although it is not published until 1832, after his death), also writing the political sonnet &quot;England in 1819&quot; (published 1839), &quot;Ode to the West Wind&quot; (published 1820), &quot;The Cenci: A Tragedy, in Five Acts&quot; (printed in Italy, but not first performed publicly until 1922) and &quot;Julian and Maddalo&quot; (published in his &quot;Posthumous Poems&quot; of 1824) and beginning his prose work &quot;A Philosophical View of Reform&quot;.
*September 20 – The Carlsbad Decrees are issued throughout the German Confederation, suppressing liberal and nationalist views and censoring the press.
*October – In Britain, Richard Carlile is convicted of blasphemy and sent to prison for publishing &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; by Thomas Paine.
*December 20 – Walter Scott&#x27;s popular Waverley Novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; is published anonymously in 3 volumes by Archibald Constable in Edinburgh, dated 1820. A chivalric romance set in 12th-century England, it represents a move away from Scott setting his fiction in Scotland.
*&quot;unknown dates&quot; 
**Joseph Perl&#x27;s epistolary novel &quot;Megalleh Temirim&quot; (&quot;Revealer of Secrets&quot;), written under the name &quot;Obadiah ben Pethahiah&quot; and published in Vienna, becomes the first novel to be published in the Hebrew language.
**The publisher Collins is founded as a printer of religious literature in Glasgow by William Collins.
**W. &amp; R. Chambers, established by bookseller brothers William Chambers of Glenormiston and Robert Chambers in Edinburgh, begin publishing with a posthumous collection of &quot;The Songs of Robert Burns&quot;.

<text>This article contains information about the literary events and publications of 1816.

==Events==

*January – &quot;The Portico: A Repository of Science &amp; Literature&quot; launched in Baltimore with poetry, literary criticism and essays by John Neal and others.
*April – Lord Byron leaves England for good to tour continental Europe.
*April 14 – Lord Byron&#x27;s poems &quot;A Sketch from Private Life&quot; and &quot;Fare Thee Well&quot;, about his separation from his wife Anne Isabella, are published without authority in &quot;The Champion&quot;.
*May 5 – The first published poem by 20-year-old trainee surgeon John Keats, the sonnet &quot;To Solitude&quot;, appears in &quot;The Examiner&quot;.
*May 9 – Lady Caroline Lamb&#x27;s anonymous novel &quot;Glenarvon&quot; is the first book published independently by Henry Colburn in London. A &quot;roman à clef&quot;, it contains an unflattering portrait of her ex-lover Lord Byron in the rakish title character of Lord Glenarvon and provokes &quot;Purity of Heart; Or, The Ancient Costume: A Tale, in One Volume, Addressed to the Author of Glenarvon&quot;, &quot;a virulent, polemical novel&quot; by &quot;An old wife of twenty years&quot;, actually clergyman&#x27;s spouse Elizabeth Thomas.
*July – Lord Byron, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Polidori, who have gathered at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva in a rainy Switzerland in this &#x27;Year Without a Summer&#x27;, tell each other tales. This spawns two classic Gothic narratives, Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and Polidori&#x27;s &quot;The Vampyre&quot; (based on Byron&#x27;s &quot;Fragment of a Novel&quot;). Byron also writes the poem &quot;Darkness&quot;. In late August Shelley and Godwin return to England, taking with them some of Byron&#x27;s manuscripts for his publisher.
*September 16

==Events==
*January 14 (January 2 O.S.) – The Imperial Public Library in Saint Petersburg opens to the public.
*January 26 – Actor Edmund Kean makes his London début in the leading rôle of Shylock at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.
*February 1 – Lord Byron&#x27;s semi-autobiographical tale in verse &quot;The Corsair&quot; is published by John Murray in London and sells 10,000 copies on this day and over 25,000 in the first month, going through seven editions. His &quot;Lara&quot; sells 6,000 copies on publication in the summer. Walter Scott is to say of Byron&#x27;s poetry: &quot;He beat me out of the field in description of the stronger passions and in deep-seated knowledge of the human heart.&quot;
*July 7 – Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Waverley&quot;, his first work of fiction and a major early historical novel in English, is published anonymously by Archibald Constable in Edinburgh, a week after Scott finishes it. It sells out in two days.
*July 28–September 13 – English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley abandons his pregnant wife and runs away to France and Switzerland with the 16-year-old Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, accompanied by her stepsister Jane Clairmont, also 16.

*September 12–15 – Battle of Baltimore (War of 1812): American lawyer Francis Scott Key, witnessing the bombardment of Baltimore, Maryland, from a British ship, writes &quot;Defence of Fort McHenry&quot;. His brother-in-law arranges to have the poem published in a broadside with a recommended tune on September 17; on September 20 both the &quot;Baltimore Patriot&quot; and &quot;The American&quot; print it. The song quickly becomes popular – seventeen newspapers from Georgia to New Hampshire reprint it. In 1931, it is adopted as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; as the national anthem of the United States.
*September 21 After arrangements have been made for the United States Library of Congress, destroyed in August&#x27;s Burning of Washington, to be re-stocked by purchase of the personal library of ex-President Thomas Jefferson, Jefferson writes to Samuel H. Smith, saying that there is &quot;no subject to which a Member of Congress may not have occasion to refer&quot;.
*November 29 – In London, &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper is printed using a revolutionary steam press for the first time. It runs at a rate of 1100 copies per hour.

<text>Matthew Hopkins ( 1620 – 12 August 1647) was an English witch-hunter whose career flourished during the English Civil War. He was mainly active in East Anglia and claimed to hold the office of Witchfinder General, although that title was never bestowed by Parliament.

The son of a Puritan minister, Hopkins began his career as a witch-finder in March 1644 and lasted until his retirement in 1647. Hopkins and his colleague John Stearne sent more accused people to be hanged for witchcraft than all the other witch-hunters in England of the previous 160 years, and were solely responsible for the increase in witch trials during those years.

==Early life==
Little is known of Matthew Hopkins before 1644, and there are no surviving contemporary documents concerning him or his family. He was born in Great Wenham, Suffolk, and was the fourth son of six children. His father, James Hopkins, was a Puritan clergyman and vicar of St John&#x27;s of Great Wenham, in Suffolk. The family at one point held title &quot;to lands and tenements in Framlingham &#x27;at the castle. His father was popular with his parishioners, one of whom in 1619 left money to purchase Bibles for his then three children James, John and Thomas.

Thus Matthew Hopkins could not have been born before 1619, and could not have been older than 28 when he died, but he may have been as young as 25. Although James Hopkins had died in 1634, when the iconoclast William Dowsing, commissioned in 1643 by the Parliamentarian Earl of Manchester &quot;for the destruction of monuments of idolatry and superstition&quot;, visited the parish in 1645 he observed that &quot;there was nothing to reform&quot;. Hopkins&#x27;s brother John became Minister of South Fambridge in 1645 but was removed from the post a year later for neglecting his work. Hopkins states in his book &quot;The Discovery of Witches&quot; (1647) that he &quot;never travelled far ... to gain his experience&quot;.

In the early 1640s, Hopkins moved to Manningtree, Essex, a town on the River Stour, about from Wenham. According to tradition, Hopkins used his recently acquired inheritance of a hundred marks (£66 13s. 4d.) to establish himself as a gentleman and to buy the Thorn Inn in Mistley. From the way that he presented evidence in trials, Hopkins is commonly thought to have been trained as a lawyer, but there is scant evidence to suggest this was the case.

==Witch-hunting==


Following the Lancaster Witch Trials (1612–1634), William Harvey, physician to King Charles I of England, had been ordered to examine the four women accused, and from this there came a requirement to have material proof of being a witch. The work of Hopkins and John Stearne was not necessarily to prove any of the accused had committed acts of maleficium, but to prove that they had made a covenant with the Devil. Before this point, any malicious acts on the part of witches were treated identically to those of other criminals, until it was seen that, according to contemporary beliefs about the structure of witchcraft, they owed their powers to a deliberate act of their choosing.

Witches then became heretics to Christianity, which became the greatest of their crimes and sins. Within continental and Roman Law witchcraft was &quot;crimen exceptum&quot;: a crime so foul that all normal legal procedures were superseded. Because the Devil was not going to &quot;confess&quot;, it was necessary to gain a confession from the human involved.

The witch-hunts undertaken by Stearne and Hopkins were mainly in East Anglia, in the counties of Suffolk, Essex, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, with a few in the counties of Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire. They extended throughout the area of strongest Puritan and Parliamentarian influences which formed the powerful and influential Eastern Association from 1644 to 1647, which was centred on Essex. Both Hopkins and Stearne would have required some form of letters of safe conduct to be able to travel throughout the counties.

According to his book &quot;The Discovery of Witches&quot;, Hopkins began his career as a witch-finder after he overheard women discussing their meetings with the Devil in March 1644 in Manningtree. The first accusations were actually made by Stearne, and Hopkins was appointed as his assistant. Twenty-three women were accused of witchcraft and were tried at Chelmsford in 1645. As the English Civil War was in progress, the trial was conducted not by justices of assize, but by justices of the peace presided over by the Earl of Warwick. Four died in prison and nineteen were convicted and hanged. During this period, excepting Middlesex and chartered towns, no records show any person charged of witchcraft being sentenced to death other than by the judges of the assizes.

Hopkins and Stearne, accompanied by the women who performed the pricking, were soon travelling over eastern England, claiming to be officially commissioned by Parliament to uncover and prosecute witches. Together with their female assistants, they were well paid for their work, and it has been suggested that this was a motivation for his actions. Hopkins stated that &quot;his fees were to maintain his company with three horses&quot;, and that he took &quot;twenty shillings a town&quot;. The records at Stowmarket show their costs charged to the town to have been £23 () plus his travelling expenses.

The costs to the local community of Hopkins and his company were such that, in 1645, a special local tax rate had to be levied in Ipswich. Parliament was well aware of Hopkins and his team&#x27;s activities, as shown by the concerned reports of the Bury St. Edmunds witch trials of 1645. Before the trial, a report was carried to Parliament&quot;as if some busie men had made use of some ill Arts to extort such confession&quot;that a special Commission of Oyer and Terminer was granted for the trial of these witches. After the trial and execution the &quot;Moderate Intelligencer&quot;, a parliamentary paper published during the English Civil War, in an editorial of 4–11 September 1645, expressed unease with the affairs in Bury.

===Methods of investigation===
Methods of investigating witchcraft drew heavy inspiration from the &quot;Daemonologie&quot; of King James I, which was directly cited in Hopkins&#x27;s &quot;The Discovery of Witches&quot;. Although torture was nominally unlawful in England, Hopkins often used techniques such as sleep deprivation to extract confessions from his victims. He would also cut the arm of the accused with a blunt knife, and if she did not bleed, she was said to be a witch. Another of his methods was the swimming test, based on the idea that as witches had renounced their baptism, water would reject them. Suspects were tied to a chair and thrown into water: all those who &quot;swam&quot; (floated) were considered to be witches. Hopkins was warned against the use of &quot;swimming&quot; without receiving the victim&#x27;s permission first. This led to the legal abandonment of the test by the end of 1645.

Hopkins and his assistants also looked for the Devil&#x27;s mark. This was a mark that all witches or sorcerers were thought to possess that was said to be dead to all feeling and would not bleed – although it was sometimes a mole, birthmark or an extra nipple. If the suspected witch had no such visible marks invisible ones could be discovered by pricking. Therefore, &quot;witch prickers&quot; were employed, who pricked the accused with knives and special needles looking for such marks, normally after the suspect had been shaved of all body hair. It was believed that the witch&#x27;s familiar, an animal such as a cat or dog, would drink the witch&#x27;s blood from the mark, as a baby drinks milk from the nipple.

===Opposition===
Hopkins and his company quickly ran into opposition after their work began, but one of his main antagonists was John Gaule, vicar of Great Staughton in Huntingdonshire. Gaule had attended a woman from St Neots who was held in gaol charged with witchcraft until such time as Hopkins could attend. Upon hearing that the woman had been interviewed, Hopkins wrote a letter to a contact asking whether he would be given a &quot;good welcome&quot;. Gaule hearing of this letter wrote his publication &quot;Select Cases of Conscience touching Witches and Witchcrafts&quot;; London, (1646)dedicated to Colonel Walton of the House of Commonsand began a programme of Sunday sermons to suppress witch-hunting.

In Norfolk, both Hopkins and Stearne were questioned by justices of the assizes about the torturing and fees. Hopkins was asked if methods of investigation did not make the finders themselves witches, and if with all his knowledge did he not also have a secret, or had used &quot;unlawful courses of torture&quot;. By the time this court session resumed in 1647, Stearne and Hopkins had retired, Hopkins to Manningtree and Stearne to Bury St Edmunds.

===Colonial impact===
Hopkins&#x27;s witch-hunting methods were outlined in his book &quot;The Discovery of Witches,&quot; which was published in 1647. These practices were recommended in law books. During the year following the publication of Hopkins&#x27;s book, trials and executions for witchcraft began in the New England colonies with the hanging of Alse Young of Windsor, Connecticut, on May 26, 1647, followed by the conviction of Margaret Jones. As described in the journal of Governor John Winthrop, the evidence assembled against Margaret Jones was gathered by the use of Hopkins&#x27;s techniques of &quot;searching&quot; and &quot;watching&quot;.

Jones&#x27;s execution was the first in a witch-hunt that lasted in New England from 1648 until 1663. About eighty people throughout New England were accused of practising witchcraft during that period, of whom fifteen women and two men were executed. Some of Hopkins&#x27;s methods were employed during the Salem Witch Trials, which occurred primarily in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692–93. These trials resulted in 19 executions for witchcraft, one man, Giles Corey, pressed to death for refusing to plead, and 150 imprisonments.

==Death and legacy==

Matthew Hopkins died at his home in Manningtree, Essex, on 12 August 1647, probably of pleural tuberculosis. He was buried a few hours after his death in the graveyard of the Church of St Mary at Mistley Heath. In the words of historian Malcolm Gaskill, Matthew Hopkins &quot;lives on as an anti-hero and bogeyman – utterly ethereal, endlessly malleable&quot;. According to historian Rossell Hope Robbins, Hopkins &quot;acquired an evil reputation which in later days made his name synonymous with fingerman or informer paid by authorities to commit perjury&quot;.

What historian James Sharpe has characterised as a &quot;pleasing legend&quot; grew up around the circumstances of Hopkins&#x27;s death, according to which he was subjected to his own swimming test and executed as a witch, but the parish registry at Mistley confirms his burial there.

<doc id="208131" wikidata="Q151070" url="?curid=208131" title="Powdered sugar">
<text>Powdered sugar, also called confectioners&#x27; sugar and icing sugar is a finely ground sugar produced by milling granulated sugar into a powdered state. It usually contains between 2% and 5% of an anti-caking agent—such as corn starch, potato starch or tricalcium phosphate—to absorb moisture, prevent clumping, and improve flow. Although most often produced in a factory, a proxy for powdered sugar can be made by processing ordinary granulated sugar in a coffee grinder, or by crushing it by hand in a mortar and pestle.

==Use==
Powdered sugar is used in industrial food production when a quick-dissolving sugar is required. Home cooks use it principally to make icing or frosting and other cake decorations. It is often dusted onto baked goods to add a subtle sweetness and delicate decoration.

Powdered sugar is available in varying degrees of fineness, most commonly XXX, XXXX, and 10X: the greater the number of Xs, the finer the particles. The most commonly used powdered sugars are those categorized as 6X and 10X. Finer particles absorb more moisture, which results in caking. Because of anticaking agents, it cannot always be used as a substitute for granulated sugar. Canadian regulations limit powdered sugar to 5% starch or an anticaking agent.

==Other varieties==

===Caster sugar===
Caster sugar (also referred to as &quot;superfine&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, or &quot;baker&#x27;s sugar&quot;) has a larger particle size than powdered sugar, approximately half that of granulated sugar, and has no added starch. It is commonly used in baking and cold mixed drinks because it dissolves faster than granulated white sugar. Caster sugar can be easily prepared at home by grinding white sugar in a food processor to make it finer. The most common food caster sugar is used in is meringue.

===Snow powder===

Snow powder (or snow sugar) is a non-melting form of icing sugar used for visual appeal on cakes or pastries that require refrigeration. It usually contains glucose, starch, and anti-binding agents (such as titanium dioxide, which gives it a vibrant white color), and retains its structure and look even when dusted onto baked goods that are slightly wet, such as fruit bars and tarts. It will not melt even if it is sprinkled on whipped cream or ice cream. It is mostly used for decorative purposes.

Snow sugar is less sweet than regular powdered sugar because glucose is around 20% less sweet than table sugar, which also contains fructose. Fructose tastes more than twice as sweet as glucose.

==History==
Factory-made powdered sugar became available during the 19th century. Before that, sugar came in the form of a sugar loaf, and bakers ground and sieved the lumps of sugar to get fine icing sugar.

<doc id="208138" wikidata="Q3211279" url="?curid=208138" title="The Necessity of Atheism">
<text>&quot;The Necessity of Atheism&quot; is an essay on atheism by the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, printed in 1811 by Charles and William Phillips in Worthing while Shelley was a student at University College, Oxford.

A signed copy was sent to all the heads of Oxford colleges at the University. At that time most lecturers at Oxford were ordained by the Church of England (not till later in the century would this change) and were acquainted with the concept of blasphemy. While England did not consider Atheism itself to be illegal at the time, promotion of the idea of Atheism was. English law prohibiting blasphemy was not repealed until 2008.

The content provided ample grounds for authorities to effect his being rusticated for contumacy along with his refusing to deny authorship, together with his friend and fellow student, Thomas Jefferson Hogg. A revised and expanded version of the text was included as one of the notes to Shelley&#x27;s poem &quot;Queen Mab&quot; in 1813, and some reprints with the title &quot;The Necessity of Atheism&quot; are based on this rather than the 1811 pamphlet.

==Synopsis==
The tract starts with the following rationale of the author&#x27;s goals:


Shelley made a number of claims in &quot;Necessity&quot;, including that one&#x27;s beliefs are involuntary, and, therefore, that atheists do not choose to be so and should not be persecuted. Towards the end of the pamphlet he writes: &quot;the mind cannot believe in the existence of a God.&quot; Shelley signed the pamphlet, &quot;Thro&#x27; deficiency of proof, AN ATHEIST&quot;, which gives an idea of the empiricist nature of Shelley&#x27;s beliefs. According to Berman, Shelley also believed himself to have &quot;refuted all the possible types of arguments for God&#x27;s existence,&quot; but Shelley himself encouraged readers to offer proofs if they possess them.

Opinion is divided upon the characterisation of Shelley&#x27;s beliefs, at the time of the writing of &quot;Necessity&quot;. At the very beginning of his note on the line &quot;There is no God&quot; in Canto VII of &quot;Queen Mab&quot;, published just two years later and based on &quot;Necessity&quot;, Shelley qualifies his definition of atheism:


Shelley also quotes the Dutch pantheist Baruch Spinoza later in the Note, but there is no explicit statement of pantheistic views.

Shelley scholar Carlos Baker states that &quot;the title of his college pamphlet should have been &quot;The Necessity of Agnosticism&quot; rather than &quot;The Necessity of Atheism&quot;,&quot; while historian David Berman argues that Shelley was an atheist, both because he characterised himself as such, and because &quot;he denies the existence of God in both published works and private letters&quot; during the same period. 

==Authorship==
Although &quot;The Necessity of Atheism&quot; is often attributed solely to Shelley, historian of atheism David Berman says that Shelley &quot;was probably assisted by his friend T.J. Hogg&quot;.

==Format==
The original pamphlet was described by Percy Vaughan as &quot;a single foolscap sheet folded in octavo, consisting of half-title (with blank reverse), title page... (with blank reverse), &quot;Advertisement&quot; (with blank reverse), and text occupying pages 7–13. At the foot of page 13 is the imprint, &quot;&quot;Phillips, Printers, Worthing&quot;,&quot; and the reverse of the page is blank. A blank leaf completes the sheet.&quot;

==Publication history==
The pamphlet was first published on 13 or 14 February 1811.
Very few copies of the original 16-page 1811 pamphlet survive, as most were destroyed after publication. Only six are known to exist in libraries today (Nicolas Walter knew of five in 1998; a sixth was discovered at Edinburgh University in 2015):

* Bodleian Library, Oxford University (bound with three other pamphlets by Shelley). This (imperfect, lacking the half-title page) copy had been Shelley&#x27;s gift to bookseller Thomas Hookham, but eventually found its way via Leigh Hunt to Shelley&#x27;s son Sir Percy Shelley, whose wife Lady Jane Shelley gave it to the Bodleian.
* British Library, London (part of the restricted-access Ashley Library Printed books, microfilm available. This copy was retained by the Oxford booksellers Munday &amp; Slatter (later Slatter &amp; Rose). John Rose kept it until his death in 1897, when it was purchased by Thomas J Wise, whose Ashley Library ended up in the British Library)
* St. John&#x27;s College, University of Cambridge
* Edinburgh University Library
* Robert H. Taylor Collection, Princeton University Library, New Jersey, United States (a copy apparently retained by the family of John Rose, the original printer of the pamphlet)
* Miriam Lutcher Stark Library, Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas (bought for $9,300 in 1939, a decision investigated by the Texas House of Representatives in 1943).

<text>The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes in many organisms, including mammals, and is found in both males and females. It is a part of the XY sex-determination system and XO sex-determination system. The X chromosome was named for its unique properties by early researchers, which resulted in the naming of its counterpart Y chromosome, for the next letter in the alphabet, following its subsequent discovery.

==Discovery==

It was first noted that the X chromosome was special in 1890 by Hermann Henking in Leipzig. Henking was studying the testicles of &quot; Pyrrhocoris&quot; and noticed that one chromosome did not take part in meiosis. Chromosomes are so named because of their ability to take up staining (&quot;chroma&quot; in Greek means &quot;color&quot;). Although the X chromosome could be stained just as well as the others, Henking was unsure whether it was a different class of the object and consequently named it &quot;X element&quot;, which later became X chromosome after it was established that it was indeed a chromosome.

The idea that the X chromosome was named after its similarity to the letter &quot;X&quot; is mistaken. All chromosomes normally appear as an amorphous blob under the microscope and take on a well-defined shape only during mitosis. This shape is vaguely X-shaped for all chromosomes. It is entirely coincidental that the Y chromosome, during mitosis, has two very short branches which can look merged under the microscope and appear as the descender of a Y-shape.

It was first suggested that the X chromosome was involved in sex determination by Clarence Erwin McClung in 1901. After comparing his work on locusts with Henking&#x27;s and others, McClung noted that only half the sperm received an X chromosome. He called this chromosome an &quot;accessory chromosome&quot;, and insisted (correctly) that it was a &quot;proper&quot; chromosome, and theorized (incorrectly) that it was the male-determining chromosome.

==Inheritance pattern==

Luke Hutchison noticed that a number of possible ancestors on the X chromosome inheritance line at a given ancestral generation follows the Fibonacci sequence. A male individual has an X chromosome, which he received from his mother, and a Y chromosome, which he received from his father. The male counts as the &quot;origin&quot; of his own X chromosome (formula_1), and at his parents&#x27; generation, his X chromosome came from a single parent (formula_2). The male&#x27;s mother received one X chromosome from her mother (the son&#x27;s maternal grandmother), and one from her father (the son&#x27;s maternal grandfather), so two grandparents contributed to the male descendant&#x27;s X chromosome (formula_3). The maternal grandfather received his X chromosome from his mother, and the maternal grandmother received X chromosomes from both of her parents, so three great-grandparents contributed to the male descendant&#x27;s X chromosome (formula_4). Five great-great-grandparents contributed to the male descendant&#x27;s X chromosome (formula_5), etc. (Note that this assumes that all ancestors of a given descendant are independent, but if any genealogy is traced far enough back in time, ancestors begin to appear on multiple lines of the genealogy, until eventually, a population founder appears on all lines of the genealogy.)

==Humans==
===Function===

The X chromosome in humans spans more than 153 million base pairs (the building material of DNA). It represents about 800 protein-coding genes compared to the Y chromosome containing about 107 protein-coding genes (42 exclusive protein-coding genes), out of 20,000–25,000 total genes in the human genome.
Each person usually has one pair of sex chromosomes in each cell. Females typically have two X chromosomes, whereas males typically have one X and one Y chromosome. Both males and females retain one of their mother&#x27;s X chromosomes, and females retain their second X chromosome from their father. Since the father retains his X chromosome from his mother, a human female has one X chromosome from her paternal grandmother (father&#x27;s side), and one X chromosome from her mother. This inheritance pattern follows the Fibonacci numbers at a given ancestral depth.

Genetic disorders that are due to mutations in genes on the X chromosome are described as X linked. If the X chromosome has a genetic disease gene, it always causes illness in male patients, since men have only one X chromosome and therefore only one copy of each gene. Females, instead, require both X chromosomes to have the illness, and as a result could potentially only be a carrier of genetic illness, since their second X chromosome overrides the first. For example, hemophilia A and B and congenital red–green color blindness run in families this way.

The X chromosome carries hundreds of genes but few, if any, of these have anything to do directly with sex determination. Early in embryonic development in females, one of the two X chromosomes is permanently inactivated in nearly all somatic cells (cells other than egg and sperm cells). This phenomenon is called X-inactivation or Lyonization, and creates a Barr body. If X-inactivation in the somatic cell meant a complete de-functionalizing of one of the X-chromosomes, it would ensure that females, like males, had only one functional copy of the X chromosome in each somatic cell. This was previously assumed to be the case. However, recent research suggests that the Barr body may be more biologically active than was previously supposed.

The partial inactivation of the X-chromosome is due to repressive heterochromatin that compacts the DNA and prevents the expression of most genes. Heterochromatin compaction is regulated by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2).

===Genes===
==== Number of genes ====
The following are some of the gene count estimates of human X chromosome. Because researchers use different approaches to genome annotation their predictions of the number of genes on each chromosome varies (for technical details, see gene prediction). Among various projects, the collaborative consensus coding sequence project (CCDS) takes an extremely conservative strategy. So CCDS&#x27;s gene number prediction represents a lower bound on the total number of human protein-coding genes.

==== Gene list ====

The following is a partial list of genes on human chromosome X. For complete list, see the link in the infobox on the right.
===Structure===

It is theorized by Ross et al. 2005 and Ohno 1967 that the X chromosome is at least partially derived from the autosomal (non-sex-related) genome of other mammals, evidenced from interspecies genomic sequence alignments.

The X chromosome is notably larger and has a more active euchromatin region than its Y chromosome counterpart. Further comparison of the X and Y reveal regions of homology between the two. However, the corresponding region in the Y appears far shorter and lacks regions that are conserved in the X throughout primate species, implying a genetic degeneration for Y in that region. Because males have only one X chromosome, they are more likely to have an X chromosome-related disease.

It is estimated that about 10% of the genes encoded by the X chromosome are associated with a family of &quot;CT&quot; genes, so named because they encode for markers found in both tumor cells (in cancer patients) as well as in the human testis (in healthy patients).

===Role in disease===
====Numerical abnormalities====
Klinefelter syndrome:
* Klinefelter syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male&#x27;s cells.
* Males with Klinefelter syndrome typically have one extra copy of the X chromosome in each cell, for a total of two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome (47,XXY). It is less common for affected males to have two or three extra X chromosomes (48,XXXY or 49,XXXXY) or extra copies of both the X and Y chromosomes (48,XXYY) in each cell. The extra genetic material may lead to tall stature, learning and reading disabilities, and other medical problems. Each extra X chromosome lowers the child&#x27;s IQ by about 15 points, which means that the average IQ in Klinefelter syndrome is in general in the normal range, although below average. When additional X and/or Y chromosomes are present in 48,XXXY, 48,XXYY, or 49,XXXXY, developmental delays and cognitive difficulties can be more severe and mild intellectual disability may be present.
* Klinefelter syndrome can also result from an extra X chromosome in only some of the body&#x27;s cells. These cases are called mosaic 46,XY/47,XXY.

Trisomy X
* This syndrome results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female&#x27;s cells. Females with trisomy X have three X chromosomes, for a total of 47 chromosomes per cell. The average IQ of females with this syndrome is 90, while the average IQ of unaffected siblings is 100. Their stature on average is taller than normal females. They are fertile and their children do not inherit the condition.
* Females with more than one extra copy of the X chromosome (48, tetrasomy X or 49, pentasomy X) have been identified, but these conditions are rare.

Turner syndrome:
* This results when each of a female&#x27;s cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the features of the condition, including short stature and infertility.
* About half of individuals with Turner syndrome have monosomy X (45,X), which means each cell in a woman&#x27;s body has only one copy of the X chromosome instead of the usual two copies. Turner syndrome can also occur if one of the sex chromosomes is partially missing or rearranged rather than completely missing. Some women with Turner syndrome have a chromosomal change in only some of their cells. These cases are called Turner syndrome mosaics (45,X/46,XX).

==== X-linked recessive disorders ====
Sex linkage was first discovered in insects, e.g., T. H. Morgan&#x27;s 1910 discovery of the pattern of inheritance of the white eyes mutation in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;. Such discoveries helped to explain x-linked disorders in humans, e.g., haemophilia A and B, adrenoleukodystrophy, and red-green color blindness.

====Other disorders====

XX male syndrome is a rare disorder, where the SRY region of the Y chromosome has recombined to be located on one of the X chromosomes. As a result, the XX combination after fertilization has the same effect as a XY combination, resulting in a male. However, the other genes of the X chromosome cause feminization as well.

X-linked endothelial corneal dystrophy is an extremely rare disease of cornea associated with Xq25 region. Lisch epithelial corneal dystrophy is associated with Xp22.3.

Megalocornea 1 is associated with Xq21.3-q22

Adrenoleukodystrophy, a rare and fatal disorder that is carried by the mother on the x-cell. It affects only boys between the ages of 5 and 10 and destroys the protective cell surrounding the nerves, myelin, in the brain. The female carrier hardly shows any symptoms because females have a copy of the x-cell. This disorder causes a once healthy boy to lose all abilities to walk, talk, see, hear, and even swallow. Within 2 years after diagnosis, most boys with Adrenoleukodystrophy die.

<doc id="208145" wikidata="Q466854" url="?curid=208145" title="Scotch bonnet">
<text>Scotch bonnet (also known as Bonney peppers, or Caribbean red peppers) is a variety of chili pepper named for its supposed resemblance to a Scottish tam o&#x27; shanter bonnet. It is native to the Americas—a cultivar of &quot;Capsicum chinense&quot;, which originated in the Amazon Basin, Central and South America.

==History==

The indigenous Amerindians of the Antilles, the Tainos and later the Caribs, transported scotch bonnet peppers and other staples like cassava and sweet potato on huge canoes. Both of these Arawakan subgroups originated in the Orinoco River Valley (present-day Venezuela). The Tainos from the Yucatán Peninsula and Belize were pioneers in traveling to the Greater Antilles, and they took a variety of chilies with them. They have since become a staple of Caribbean cuisine, especially Jamaican cuisine.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, Spanish and Portuguese colonizers introduced scotch bonnets to other regions. Through the Columbian exchange, the five domesticated species of &quot;Capsicum&quot; were introduced to Europe, Africa and Asia, where more varieties developed across the globe. They became so popular in Asia and Africa, that many consumers there are unaware of the chili peppers&#x27; Mesoamerican origins.

Like the closely related habanero, scotch bonnets have a heat rating of 100,000–350,000 Scoville units. For comparison, most jalapeño peppers have a heat rating of 2,500 to 8,000. A completely sweet variety of scotch bonnet, cachucha, is grown on some Caribbean islands.
== Cuisine ==
Scotch bonnets are used in many cuisines worldwide for hot sauces and condiments. They are compared to &quot;habaneros&quot;, since both are cultivars of the same species, with the same level of heat and pungency. However, scotch bonnets have a sweeter flavour profile and stouter shape.

Scotch bonnets are mostly used in Caribbean, West African, Sri Lankan, and Maldivian cuisines and pepper sauces. In Jamaica, scotch bonnets are key ingredients in various Jamaican dishes, such as jerk, which is also of Taino origin and indigenous to the island.

In Latin American cuisine, it may be used as a substitute for similar peppers, like &quot;habaneros&quot;. Scotch bonnets are used in coastal Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama and San Andrés for Caribbean-styled recipes adopted from Jamaica, such as rice and peas, rondón, and beef patties— as well as, other dishes like &quot;sous&quot; and ceviche.

<text>Icterids () or New World blackbirds make up a family, the Icteridae (), of small to medium-sized, often colorful, New World passerine birds. The family contains 108 species and is divided into 30 genera. Most species have black as a predominant plumage color, often enlivened by yellow, orange, or red. The species in the family vary widely in size, shape, behavior, and coloration. The name, meaning &quot;jaundiced ones&quot; (from the prominent yellow feathers of many species) comes from the Ancient Greek &quot;ikteros&quot; via the Latin &quot;ictericus&quot;. This group includes the New World blackbirds, New World orioles, the bobolink, meadowlarks, grackles, cowbirds, oropendolas, and caciques.

Despite the similar names, the first groups are only distantly related to the Old World common blackbird (a thrush) or the Old World orioles.

The Icteridae are not to be confused with the Icteriidae, a family created in 2017 and consisting of one species — the yellow-breasted chat (&quot;Icteria virens&quot;).

==Characteristics==
Most icterid species live in the tropics, although many species also occur in temperate regions, such as the red-winged blackbird and the long-tailed meadowlark. The highest densities of breeding species are found in Colombia and southern Mexico. They inhabit a range of habitats, including scrub, swamp, forest, and savanna. Temperate species are migratory, with many species that nest in the United States and Canada moving south into Mexico and Central America.
Icterids are variable in size, and often display considerable sexual dimorphism, with brighter coloration and greater size in males being typical. While such dimorphism is widely known in passerines, the sexual dimorphism by size is uniquely extreme in icterids. For example, the male great-tailed grackle is 60% heavier than the female. The smallest icterid species is the orchard oriole, in which the female averages 15 cm in length (6 in) and in weight, while the largest is the Amazonian oropendola, the male of which measures and weighs about . This variation is greater than in any other passerine family (unless the kinglet calyptura belongs with the cotingas, which would then have greater variation). One unusual morphological adaptation shared by the icterids is gaping, where the skull is configured to allow them to open their bills strongly rather than passively, allowing them to force open gaps to obtain otherwise hidden food. Most icterids have rounded tails and lack rictal bristles. They have nine primary feathers and are placed among the nine-primaried oscines.

Icterids have adapted to taking a wide range of foods. Oropendolas and caciques use their gaping motion to open the skins of fruit to obtain the soft insides, and have long bills adapted to the process. Others such as cowbirds and the bobolink have shorter, stubbier bills for crushing seeds. The Jamaican blackbird uses its bill to pry amongst tree bark and epiphytes, and has adopted the evolutionary niche filled elsewhere in the Neotropics by woodcreepers. Orioles drink nectar.

The nesting habits of these birds are also variable, including pendulous woven nests in the oropendolas and orioles. Many icterids are colonial, nesting in colonies of up to 100,000 birds. Some cowbird species engage in brood parasitism; females lay their eggs in the nests of other species, in a similar fashion to some cuckoos.

Some species of icterid have become agricultural pests; for example, red-winged blackbirds in the United States are considered the worst vertebrate pests on some crops, such as rice. The cost of controlling blackbirds in California was $30 per acre in 1994. Not all species have been as successful, and a number of species are threatened with extinction. These include insular forms such as the Jamaican blackbird, yellow-shouldered blackbird, and St Lucia oriole, all threatened by habitat loss; and the tricolored blackbird of California, which is threatened by habitat loss and destruction of nests.

==Folklore==
Cacique and oropendola species are called &quot;paucar&quot; or similar names in Peru. As &quot;paucares&quot; are considered very intelligent, Native Americans feed the brains to their children to make them fast learners. As the male plays no part in nesting and care of the young, a man who does not work may be called a &quot;male &quot;paucar&quot;&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
The family group was introduced in 1825 as a subfamily Icterina by Irish zoologist Nicholas Vigors. He placed the subfamily in the starling family Sturnidae.

A phylogenetic analysis of the passerine families by Carl Oliveros and collaborators published in 2019 found that the family Icteridae was sister to the family Icteriidae (containing the yellow breasted chat) and together these two families formed a clade that was sister to the New World warbler family Parulidae.
The genus level cladogram shown below is based on a molecular phylogenetic study by Alexis Powell and collaborators that was published in 2014. The study compared mitochondrial gene sequences. The subfamilies are those that were proposed in 2016 by Van Remsen and collaborators. The numbers of species are taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).
==Genera==
Prehistoric icterid genera that have been described from Pleistocene fossil remains are &quot;Pandanaris&quot; from Rancho La Brea and &quot;Pyelorhamphus&quot; from Shelter Cave.

<text>Lake Lucerne (, literally &#x27;Lake of the four forested settlements&#x27; (in English usually translated as &quot;forest cantons&quot;), , ) is a lake in central Switzerland and the fourth largest in the country.

== Geography ==
The lake has a complicated shape, with several sharp bends and four arms. It starts in the south–north bound Reuss Valley between steep cliffs above the &quot;Urnersee&quot; from Flüelen towards Brunnen to the north before it makes a sharp bend to the west where it continues into the &quot;Gersauer Becken&quot;. Here is also the deepest point of the lake with . Even further west of it is the &quot;Buochser Bucht&quot;, but the lake sharply turns north again through the narrow opening between the &quot;Unter Nas&quot; (lower nose) of the Bürgenstock to the west and the &quot;Ober Nas&quot; (upper nose) of the Rigi to the east to reach the &quot;Vitznauer Bucht&quot;. In front of Vitznau below the Rigi the lake turns sharply west again to reach the center of a four-arm cross, called the &quot;Chrütztrichter&quot; (Cross Funnel). Here converge the &quot;Vitznauer Bucht&quot; with the &quot;Küssnachtersee&quot; from the north, the &quot;Luzernersee&quot; from the west, and the &quot;Horwer Bucht&quot; and the &quot;Stanser Trichter&quot; to the south, which is to be found right below the northeast side of the Pilatus and the west side of the Bürgenstock. At the very narrow pass between the east dropper of the Pilatus (called &quot;Lopper&quot;) and Stansstad the lake reaches its southwestern arm at Alpnachstad on the steep southern foothills of the Pilatus, the &quot;Alpnachersee&quot;. The lake drains its water into the Reuss in Lucerne from its arm called &quot;Luzernersee&quot; (which literally translates as &quot;Lake of Lucerne&quot;).

The entire lake has a total area of 114 km2 (44 sq mi) at an elevation of a.s.l., and a maximum depth of . Its volume is 11.8 km3. Much of the shoreline rises steeply into mountains up to 1,500 m above the lake, resulting in many picturesque views including those of the mountains Rigi and Pilatus.

The Reuss enters the lake at Flüelen, in the part called &quot;Urnersee&quot; (&quot;Lake of Uri&quot;, in the canton of Uri) and exits at Lucerne. The lake also receives the Muota at Brunnen, the Engelberger Aa at Buochs, and the Sarner Aa at Alpnachstad.

It is possible to circumnavigate the lake by train and road, though the railway route circumvents the lake even on the north side of the Rigi via Arth-Goldau. Since 1980, the A2 motorway leads through the Seelisberg Tunnel in order to reach the route to the Gotthard Pass in just half an hour in Altdorf, Uri right south of the beginning of the lake in Flüelen.

Steamers and other passenger boats ply between the different villages and towns on the lake. It is a popular tourist destination, both for native Swiss and foreigners, and there are many hotels and resorts along the shores. In addition, the meadow of the Rütli, traditional site of the founding of the Swiss Confederation, is on the &quot;Urnersee&quot; shore. A 35 km commemorative walkway, the Swiss Path, was built around the Lake of Uri to celebrate the country&#x27;s 700th anniversary in 1991.

Archaeologists surveying the lake-bed (during the construction of a pipeline) from 2019 to 2021 found the remains of a Bronze Age village with artifacts dating to around 1000 BC. Later, the new findings indicated that the area was settled 2,000 years earlier than historians previously thought.

Lake Lucerne borders on the three original Swiss cantons of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden (which today is divided into the cantons of Obwalden and Nidwalden), as well as the canton of Lucerne, thus the name &quot;Vierwaldstättersee&quot; (lit.: Lake of the Four Forested Settlements). Many of the oldest communities of Switzerland are along the shore, including Küssnacht, Weggis, Vitznau, Gersau, Brunnen, Altdorf, Buochs, and Treib.
Lake Lucerne is singularly irregular and appears to lie in four different valleys, all related to the conformation of the adjoining mountains. The central portion of the lake lies in two parallel valleys whose direction is from west to east, the one lying north, the other south of the ridge of the Bürgenstock. These are connected through a narrow strait, scarcely one kilometre wide, between the two rocky promontories called respectively &quot;Unter Nas&quot; and &quot;Ober Nas&quot; (Lower and Upper Nose). It is not unlikely that the southern of these two divisions of the lake—called &quot;Buochser Bucht&quot;—formerly extended to the west over the isthmus whereon stands the town of Stans, thus forming an island of the Bürgenstock. The west end of the main branch of the lake, whence a comparatively shallow bay extends to the town of Lucerne, is intersected obliquely by a deep trench whose south-west end is occupied by the branch called &quot;Alpnachersee&quot;, while the north-east branch forms the long arm of Küssnacht, &quot;Küssnachtersee&quot;. These both lie in the direct line of a valley that stretches with scarcely a break in between the Uri Alps and the Emmental Alps. At the eastern end of the Gersauer Becken, where the containing walls of the lake-valley are directed from east to west, it is joined at an acute angle by the arm of Uri, or the &quot;Urnersee&quot;, lying in the northern prolongation of the deep cleft that gives a passage to the Reuss, between the Uri Alps and the Glarus Alps.
The Urnersee occupies the northernmost and deep portion of the great cleft of the Reuss Valley, which has cut through the Alpine ranges from the St Gotthard Pass to the neighbourhood of Schwyz. From its eastern shore the mountains rise in almost bare walls of rock to a height of from above the water. The two highest summits are the Fronalpstock and the Rophaien (2078 m). Between them the steep glen or ravine of the Riemenstaldener Tal descends to Sisikon, the only village with Flüelen right on the shore on that side of the Urnersee. On the opposite or western shore, the mountains attain still greater dimensions. The Niederbauen Chulm is succeeded by the Oberbauenstock, and farther south, above the ridge of the Scharti, appear the snowy peaks of the Gitschen and the Uri Rotstock (2,928 m). In the centre opens the Reuss Valley, backed by the rugged summits of the Urner and Glarner Alps.

The breadth of these various sections of the lake is very variable, but is usually between one and two miles (3 km). The lake&#x27;s surface, whose mean height above the sea is 434 metres, is the lowest point of the cantons of Uri, Obwalden and Nidwalden. Originally the lake was susceptible to variations in level and flooding along its shoreline. Between 1859 and 1860, the introduction of a needle dam in the Reuss in the city of Lucerne, just upstream from the Spreuerbrücke, allowed the lake level to be stabilised.

The culminating point of the lake&#x27;s drainage basin, as well as Central Switzerland, is the Dammastock at 3,630 metres above sea level.

==Name==
The name of &quot;Vierwaldstättersee&quot; is first used in the 16th century. Before the 16th century, the entire lake was known as &quot;Luzerner See&quot; &quot;Lake Lucerne&quot;, as remains the English (and partly Italian, as &quot;Lago di Lucerna&quot;) usage.
The (three) &quot;&quot; (lit.: &quot;forested sites/settlements&quot;, in English usually translated as &quot;forest cantons&quot;) since the 14th century were the confederate allies of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden. The notion of &quot;Four Waldstätten&quot; (&quot;Vier Waldstätten&quot;), with the addition of the canton of Lucerne, is first recorded in the 1450s, in an addition to the &quot;Silver Book&quot; of Egloff Etterlin of Lucerne. 

The nine different parts of the lake have individual designations: 

*&quot;Urnersee&quot; (&quot;Lake of Uri&quot;): The first part of the lake, at the mouth of the Reuss between Flüelen and Brunnen.
*&quot;Gersauer Becken&quot; (&quot;Basin of Gersau&quot;) next to Gersau below the Rigi massif is the deepest part of the lake.
*&quot;Buochser Bucht&quot; (&quot;Bay of Buochs&quot;): The bay of Bouchs, where the Engelberger Aa enters the lake.
*&quot;Vitznauer Bucht&quot; (&quot;Bay of Vitznau&quot;): The part between the Bürgenstock and Rigi.
*&quot;Alpnachersee&quot; (&quot;Lake of Alpnach&quot;): the almost separate, southern arm below the southern mountainside of Pilatus near Alpnach.
*&quot;Stanser Trichter&quot; (&quot;Funnel of Stans&quot;): The part north of the Pilatus, west of Bürgenstock, and in front of Hergiswil and Stansstad.

*&quot;Küssnachtersee&quot; (&quot;Lake of Küssnacht&quot;): The most northern arm, west of the Rigi with Küssnacht SZ at its northern end.

*&quot;Chrütztrichter&quot; (&quot;Cross Funnel&quot;): The meeting point of &quot;Stanser Trichter&quot;, &quot;Luzernersee&quot;, &quot;Küssnachtersee&quot;, and &quot;Vitznauer Bucht&quot;.

*&quot;Luzernersee&quot; (&quot;Lake of Lucerne&quot;): in German usage now limited to the bay at Lucerne as far as Meggenhorn, with its effluence of the Reuss.

==Settlements==


== Navigation ==

The lake is navigable, and has formed an important part of Switzerland&#x27;s transport system for many centuries, and at least since the opening of the first track across the Gotthard Pass in 1230. This trade grew with the opening of a new mail coach road across the pass in 1830. This road had its northern terminus at Flüelen at the extreme eastern end of the lake, and the lake provided the only practical onward link to Lucerne, and hence the cities of northern Switzerland and beyond.

Whilst the development of Switzerland&#x27;s road and rail networks has relieved the lake of much of its through traffic, it continues to be used by a considerable number of vessels, both private and public. Much of this usage is tourist or leisure oriented, but the lake continues to provide practical public and cargo transport links between the smaller lakeside communities.

Passenger boats of the Schifffahrtsgesellschaft des Vierwaldstättersees (SGV) provide services on the lake, including many run by historic paddle steamers. The SGV serves 32 places along the shore of the lake, with interchange to both main line and mountain railways at various points. Under separate management, the Autofähre Beckenried-Gersau provides a car ferry service between Beckenried, on the south bank of the lake, and Gersau on the north.

Cargo barges, to a local design known as &quot;Nauen&quot;, are still used on the lake. Some have been converted for use as party boats. Other barges are used by the gravel dredging industry that operates on the lake, using large dredgers to obtain sand and gravel for use in the construction industry.

==Cultural references==

Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight&quot; Sonata derives its name from an 1832 description of the first movement by poet and music critic Ludwig Rellstab, who compared it to moonlight shining upon Lake Lucerne.

Gioacchino Rossini uses this in his &quot;William Tell&quot; Overture Section A: Sunrise over the Alps.

==Rowing==
Lake Lucerne has twice been used as a venue for the European Rowing Championships: in 1908 and then in 1926. The nearby Rotsee has since 1933 been used for rowing regattas instead.

== Tourism ==
On the way south, the English discovered the mountains of central Switzerland. Several spa and bathing resorts such as Weggis or Gersau were created. In 1871, the very first rack railway in Europe, the Vitznau-Rigi Railway, was opened. In 1889 the steepest cog railway in the world was built from Alpnachstad to Mount Pilatus. Mark Twain described an ascent to the Rigi, which led to the blossoming of Swiss tourism in the United States in the 19th century. One of the largest steamship fleets in Europe operates with five steamships on Lake Lucerne.

In the area surrounding the lake and on terraces at medium height (for example Morschach and Seelisberg) there are numerous places for tourists. The Rigi, Pilatus, the Bürgenstock, the Stanserhorn, the Buochserhorn, and the two legends, the Urirotstock and the Fronalpstock are attractive panoramic mountains near Lake Lucerne. Most of them can be reached by mountain railways, some of which have their valley station near boat stations on the lake.

There are numerous locations on the lake that are important in Swiss cultural and tourism history: Rütli, Tellsplatte, Tell Chapel, Carving Tower of Stansstad, Neu-Habsburg, Schillerstein, Treib, Astrid Chapel (Küssnacht) and Meggenhorn Castle.

=== Watersports ===

Different sports are possible in some separate areas due to the water and wind conditions. The lake is accessible from boat and yacht harbors, to lake resorts and pools (e.g. the Lido pool in Lucerne, built in 1929 by Arnold Berger). Therefore, the lake can be easily accessible from both shores. The See-Club Luzern was founded in 1881, which is now Switzerland&#x27;s largest rowing club, as well as the Reuss Luzern rowing club (Ruderclub Reuss Luzern) in 1904. The Lucerne Yacht Club (Yachtclub Luzern) has existed since 1941 and has been running since 1966 a boathouse and buoy field on Churchill-Quai in Lucerne. 

The Brunnen water sports club (Wassersportclub Brunnen), founded in 1958, held on Lake Lucerne in the first years of its existence international motorboat races and water ski championships. In 1965 the association chose a new name for the club: Lake Lucerne Water Sports Club (Wassersport-Club Vierwaldstättersee). The Central Switzerland Motorboat Club (Motorbootclub Zentralschweiz) was established in 1980 and the Hergiswil Water Sports Club (Wassersportclub Hergiswil) in 1986. SchweizMobil has created a canoe tour across Lake Lucerne between Brunnen and Gersau. Due to the wind in the Reuss Valley, the southern part of Lake Uri between the campground at Gruonbachstrand in Flüelen and Isleten is a center of windsurfing.

=== Diving ===

There are about ten places where you can dive without a boat in Lake Lucerne. The water is rather chilly all year round and therefore mostly very clear. In Lake Uri, at Sisikon, one can dive to a fragmented steep vertical wall, at the northern portal of the Schieferneggtunnel. The Lediwrack Bruno lies in front of Brunnen at a depth of 15 meters. Other well-known diving spots are in front of Vitznau, Weggis, Gersau and Hergiswil.

== Submerged munitions ==
The Swiss Armed Forces historically used Lake Lucerne as a dumping ground for old munitions, with an estimated 3,300 tonnes of munitions currently submerged in the lake. The Swiss Defence Department has offered a prize of 50,000 francs (£45,000) for the best proposal to safely remove the munitions.

<text>10 (ten) is the even natural number following 9 and preceding 11. Ten is the base of the decimal numeral system, the most common system of denoting numbers in both spoken and written language.

==Linguistics==
* A collection of ten items (most often ten years) is called a decade.
* The ordinal adjective is &quot;decimal&quot;; the distributive adjective is &quot;denary&quot;.
* Increasing a quantity by one order of magnitude is most widely understood to mean multiplying the quantity by ten.
* To reduce something by one tenth is to &quot;&quot;. (In ancient Rome, the killing of one in ten soldiers in a cohort was the punishment for cowardice or mutiny; or, one-tenth of the able-bodied men in a village as a form of retribution, thus causing a labor shortage and threat of starvation in agrarian societies.)

== Mathematics ==
Ten is the smallest noncototient number. There are exactly 10 small Pisot numbers that do not exceed the golden ratio.
=== Decagon ===

A ten sided polygon is called a decagon.

=== List of basic calculations ===


==Science==
The metric system is based on the number 10, so converting units is done by adding or removing zeros (e.g. 1 centimetre = 10 millimetres, 1 decimetre = 10 centimetres, 1 meter = 100 centimetres, 1 dekametre = 10 meters, 1 kilometre = 1,000 meters).

== Mysticism ==

* In Pythagoreanism, the number 10 played an important role and was symbolized by the tetractys.

<doc id="208153" wikidata="Q3687178" url="?curid=208153" title="Cons">
<text>In computer programming, &#x27; ( or ) is a fundamental function in most dialects of the Lisp programming language. constructs&quot; memory objects which hold two values or pointers to two values. These objects are referred to as (cons) cells, conses, non-atomic [[s-expressions]] (&quot;NATSes&quot;), or (cons) [[ordered pair|pairs]]. In Lisp jargon, the expression &quot;to cons &quot;x&quot; onto &quot;y&quot;&quot; means to construct a new object with codice_1. The resulting pair has a left half, referred to as the (the first element, or &quot;[[CAR and CDR|]]c[[Cons|ontents of the ]]a[[Cons|ddress part of ]]r[[Cons|egister]]&quot;), and a right half, referred to as the (the second element, or &quot;[[CAR and CDR|]]c[[Cons|ontents of the ]]d[[Cons|ecrement part of ]]r&quot;&#x27;egister&quot;).

It is loosely related to the object-oriented notion of a constructor, which creates a new object given arguments, and more closely related to the constructor function of an algebraic data type system.

The word &quot;cons&quot; and expressions like &quot;to cons onto&quot; are also part of a more general functional programming jargon. Sometimes operators that have a similar purpose, especially in the context of list processing, are pronounced &quot;cons&quot;. (A good example is the codice_2 operator in ML, Scala, F#, Lean, Coq, and Elm or the codice_3 operator in Haskell, which adds an element to the beginning of a list.)

==Use==
Although cons cells can be used to hold ordered pairs of data, they are more commonly used to construct more complex compound data structures, notably lists and binary trees.

===Ordered pairs===
For example, the Lisp expression constructs a cell holding 1 in its left half (the so-called field) and 2 in its right half (the field). In Lisp notation, the value looks like:

 (1 . 2)

Note the dot between 1 and 2; this indicates that the S-expression is a &quot;dotted pair&quot; (a so-called &quot;cons pair&quot;), rather than a &quot;list.&quot;

===Lists===
In Lisp, lists are implemented on top of cons pairs. More specifically, any list structure in Lisp is either:

#An empty list , which is a special object usually called .
#A cons cell whose is the first element of the list and whose is a list containing the rest of the elements.
This forms the basis of a simple, singly linked list structure whose contents can be manipulated with , , and . Note that is the only list that is not also a cons pair. As an example, consider a list whose elements are 1, 2, and 3. Such a list can be created in three steps:

#Cons 3 onto , the empty list
#Cons 2 onto the result
#Cons 1 onto the result

which is equivalent to the single expression:

 (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil)))

or its shorthand:

 (list 1 2 3)

The resulting value is the list:

 (1 . (2 . (3 . nil)))

i.e.

 *--*--*--nil
 1 2 3

which is generally abbreviated as:

 (1 2 3)

Thus, can be used to add one element to the front of an existing linked list. For example, if &quot;x&quot; is the list we defined above, then will produce the list:

 (5 1 2 3)

Another useful list procedure is append, which concatenates two existing lists (i.e. combines two lists into a single list).

===Trees===
Binary trees that only store data in their leaves are also easily constructed with . For example, the code:

 (cons (cons 1 2) (cons 3 4))

results in the tree:

 ((1 . 2) . (3 . 4))

i.e.
 / \
 / \ / \
 1 2 3 4

Technically, the list (1 2 3) in the previous example is also a binary tree, one which happens to be particularly unbalanced. To see this, simply rearrange the diagram:

 *--*--*--nil
 1 2 3

to the following equivalent:
 / \
 1 *
 2 *
 3 nil

==Use in conversation==
Cons can refer to the general process of memory allocation, as opposed to using destructive operations of the kind that would be used in an imperative programming language. For example:

I sped up the code a bit by putting in side effects instead of having it cons ridiculously.

==Functional implementation==
Since Lisp has first-class functions, all data structures, including cons cells, can be implemented using functions. For example, in Scheme:

(define (cons x y)
 (lambda (m) (m x y)))
(define (car z)
 (z (lambda (p q) p)))
(define (cdr z)
 (z (lambda (p q) q)))

This technique is known as Church encoding. It re-implements the &quot;cons&quot;, &quot;car&quot;, and &quot;cdr&quot; operations, using a function as the &quot;cons cell&quot;. Church encoding is a usual way of defining data structures in pure lambda calculus, an abstract, theoretical model of computation that is closely related to Scheme.

This implementation, while academically interesting, is impractical because it renders cons cells indistinguishable from any other Scheme procedure, as well as introduces unnecessary computational inefficiencies.

However, the same kind of encoding can be used for more complex algebraic data types with variants, where it may even turn out to be more efficient than other kinds of encoding.
This encoding also has the advantage of being implementable in a statically typed language that doesn&#x27;t have variants, such as Java, using interfaces instead of lambdas.

<text>A dozen (commonly abbreviated doz or dz) is a grouping of twelve.

The dozen may be one of the earliest primitive integer groupings, perhaps because there are approximately a dozen cycles of the Moon, or months, in a cycle of the Sun, or year. Twelve is convenient because it has a maximal number of divisors among the numbers up to its double, a property only true of 1, 2, 6, 12, 60, 360, and 2520.

The use of twelve as a base number, known as the duodecimal system (also as &quot;dozenal&quot;), originated in Mesopotamia (see also sexagesimal). Twelve dozen (122 = 144) are known as a gross; and twelve gross (123 = 1,728, the duodecimal 1,000) are called a great gross, a term most often used when shipping or buying items in bulk. A great hundred, also known as a small gross, is 120 or ten dozen.
Dozen may also be used to express a moderately large quantity as in &quot;several dozen&quot; (e.g., dozens of people came to the party).

Varying by country, some products are packaged or sold by the dozen, often foodstuff (a dozen eggs).

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;dozen&quot; comes from the old form &quot;douzaine&quot;, a French word meaning (&quot;Assemblage de choses de même nature au nombre de douze&quot; (translation: &quot;A group of twelve things of the same nature&quot;), as defined in the eighth edition of the ). This French word is a derivation from the cardinal number &quot;douze&quot; (, from Latin ) and the collective suffix &quot;-aine&quot; (from Latin &quot;-ēna&quot;), a suffix also used to form other words with similar meanings such as &quot;quinzaine&quot; (a group of fifteen), &quot;vingtaine&quot; (a group of twenty), &quot;centaine&quot; (a group of one hundred), etc. These French words have synonymous cognates in Spanish: &quot;docena&quot;, &quot;quincena&quot;, &quot;veintena&quot;, &quot;centena&quot;, etc. English &quot;dozen&quot;, French , Catalan &quot;dotzena&quot;, Portuguese &quot;dúzia&quot;, Persian dowjin &quot;دوجین&quot;, Arabic (), Turkish &quot;düzine&quot;, Hindi darjan &quot;दर्जन&quot;, German , Dutch , Italian and Polish &quot;tuzin&quot;, are also used as indefinite quantifiers to mean or (as in &quot;a dozen times&quot;, &quot;dozens of people&quot;).

A confusion may arise with the Anglo-Norman &quot;dizeyne&quot; (French &quot;dixaine&quot; or &quot;dizaine&quot;) a tithing, or group of ten households — dating from the earlier English system of grouping households into tens and hundreds for the purposes of law, order and mutual surety (see Tithing). In some texts this &#x27;dizeyne&#x27; may be rendered as &#x27;dozen&#x27;.

==Half a dozen==
The phrase &quot;half a dozen&quot; means six (6) of something, as 6 is half of 12. The idiom &quot;six of one, half a dozen of the other&quot; means two options are of equal worth so choosing one is the same as choosing the other.

==Baker&#x27;s dozen==
A baker&#x27;s dozen, devil&#x27;s dozen, or long dozen is 13, one more than a standard dozen. The broadest use of &quot;baker&#x27;s dozen&quot; today is simply a group of thirteen objects (often baked goods). The term has meant different things over the last few centuries.

In England, when selling certain goods, bakers were obliged to sell goods by the dozen at a specific weight or quality (or a specific average weight). During this time, bakers who sold a dozen units that failed to meet this requirement could be penalized with a fine. Therefore, to avoid risking this penalty, some bakers included an extra unit to be sure the minimum weight was met, bringing the total to 13 units or what is now commonly known as a baker&#x27;s dozen. The thirteenth piece of bread is called the vantage loaf.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term &quot;baker&#x27;s dozen&quot; originated in the late 16th century and is &quot;apparently so called after the former practice among bakers of including a thirteenth loaf when selling a dozen to a retailer, the extra loaf representing the retailer&#x27;s profit.&quot;

According to the 1811 &quot;Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue&quot;, by Francis Grose, &quot;a Baker&#x27;s Dozen is Thirteen; that number of rolls being allowed to the purchaser of a dozen&quot;. However, contrary to most sources, according to the anonymous 1785 version of that dictionary, which was probably also by Grose, &quot;a Baker&#x27;s Dozen is Fourteen, that number of rolls being allowed to the purchaser of a dozen&quot;.

The term has also been defined in a jocular way, as &quot;twelve of today&#x27;s and one of yesterday&#x27;s.&quot;

The term has also jokingly been described as &quot;A dozen and the baker made one extra for himself.&quot;

A lesser-used regionalism is the Texas dozen, which generally consists of 15. This is typically used only in Texas and surrounding areas for such goods as flowers or baked goods, although can be applied to anything that is counted, such as photographs.

<text>12 (twelve) is the natural number following 11 and preceding 13. 

Twelve is the 3rd superior highly composite number, the 3rd colossally abundant number, the 5th highly composite number, and is divisible by the numbers from 1 to 4, and 6, a large number of divisors comparatively.

It is central to many systems of timekeeping, including the Western calendar and units of time of day, and frequently appears in the world&#x27;s major religions.

==Name==
Twelve is the largest number with a single-syllable name in English. Early Germanic numbers have been theorized to have been non-decimal: evidence includes the unusual phrasing of eleven and twelve, the former use of &quot;hundred&quot; to refer to groups of 120, and the presence of glosses such as &quot;tentywise&quot; or &quot;ten-count&quot; in medieval texts showing that writers could not presume their readers would normally understand them that way. Such uses gradually disappeared with the introduction of Arabic numerals during the 12th-century Renaissance.

Derived from Old English, &#x27; and &#x27; are first attested in the 10th-century Lindisfarne Gospels&#x27; Book of John. It has cognates in every Germanic language (e.g. German ), whose Proto-Germanic ancestor has been reconstructed as &#x27;, from &#x27; (&quot;two&quot;) and suffix &#x27; or &#x27; of uncertain meaning. It is sometimes compared with the Lithuanian &#x27;, although &#x27; is used as the suffix for all numbers from 11 to 19 (analogous to &quot;-teen&quot;). Every other Indo-European language instead uses a form of &quot;two&quot;+&quot;ten&quot;, such as the Latin &quot;&quot;. The usual ordinal form is &quot;twelfth&quot; but &quot;dozenth&quot; or &quot;duodecimal&quot; (from the Latin word) is also used in some contexts, particularly base-12 numeration. Similarly, a group of twelve things is usually a &quot;dozen&quot; but may also be referred to as a &quot;dodecad&quot; or &quot;duodecad&quot;. The adjective referring to a group of twelve is &quot;duodecuple&quot;.

As with eleven, the earliest forms of twelve are often considered to be connected with Proto-Germanic &#x27; or &#x27; (&quot;to leave&quot;), with the implicit meaning that &quot;two is left&quot; after having already counted to ten. The Lithuanian suffix is also considered to share a similar development. The suffix &quot;&quot; has also been connected with reconstructions of the Proto-Germanic for ten.

As mentioned above, 12 has its own name in Germanic languages such as English (dozen), Dutch (), German (), and Swedish (), all derived from Old French &#x27;. It is a compound number in many other languages, e.g. Italian &#x27; (but in Spanish and Portuguese, 16, and in French, 17 is the first compound number), Japanese 十二 &quot;jūni&quot;.

===Written representation===
In prose writing, &quot;twelve&quot;, being the last single-syllable numeral, is sometimes taken as the last number to be written as a word, and 13 the first to be written using digits.
This is not a binding rule, and in English language tradition, it is sometimes recommended to spell out numbers up to and including either &quot;nine&quot;, &quot;ten&quot; or &quot;twelve&quot;, or even &quot;ninety-nine&quot; or &quot;one hundred&quot;. Another system spells out all numbers written in one or two words (&quot;sixteen&quot;, &quot;twenty-seven&quot;, &quot;fifteen thousand&quot;, but &quot;372&quot; or &quot;15,001&quot;).
In German orthography, there used to be the widely followed (but unofficial) rule of spelling out numbers up to twelve (&quot;zwölf&quot;). The Duden (the German standard dictionary) mentions this rule as outdated.

==In mathematics==
12 is a composite number, the smallest abundant number, a semiperfect number, a highly composite number, a refactorable number, and a Pell number. It is the smallest of two known sublime numbers, numbers that have a perfect number of divisors whose sum is also perfect.

There are twelve Jacobian elliptic functions and twelve cubic distance-transitive graphs.

A twelve-sided polygon is a dodecagon. In its regular form, it is the largest polygon that can uniformly tile the plane alongside other regular polygons, as with the truncated hexagonal tiling or the truncated trihexagonal tiling.

A regular dodecahedron has twelve pentagonal faces. Regular cubes and octahedrons both have 12 edges, while regular icosahedrons have 12 vertices.

The densest three-dimensional lattice sphere packing has each sphere touching twelve other spheres, and this is almost certainly true for &quot;any&quot; arrangement of spheres (the Kepler conjecture). Twelve is also the kissing number in three dimensions.

There are twelve complex apeirotopes in dimensions five and higher, which include van Oss polytopes in the form of complex formula_1-orthoplexes. There are also twelve paracompact hyperbolic Coxeter groups of uniform polytopes in five-dimensional space.

Bring&#x27;s curve is a Riemann surface of genus four, with a domain that is a regular hyperbolic 20-sided icosagon. By the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the area of this fundamental polygon is equal to formula_2.

Twelve is the smallest weight for which a cusp form exists. This cusp form is the discriminant formula_3 whose Fourier coefficients are given by the Ramanujan formula_4-function and which is (up to a constant multiplier) the 24th power of the Dedekind eta function: 
:formula_5
This fact is related to a constellation of interesting appearances of the number twelve in mathematics ranging from the fact that the abelianization of special linear group formula_6 has twelve elements, to the value of the Riemann zeta function at formula_7 being formula_8, which stems from the Ramanujan summation
:formula_9

Although the series is divergent, methods such as Ramanujan summation can assign finite values to divergent series.

===List of basic calculations===



====In other bases====

The duodecimal system (1210 [twelve] = 1012), which is the use of 12 as a division factor for many ancient and medieval weights and measures, including hours, probably originates from Mesopotamia.

==Religion==
The number twelve carries religious, mythological and magical symbolism; since antiquity, the number has generally represented perfection, entirety, or cosmic order.

=== Judaism and Christianity ===

* The significance is especially pronounced in the Hebrew Bible.
* Ishmael – the first-born son of Abraham – has 12 sons/princes (Genesis 25:16), and Jacob also has 12 sons, who are the progenitors of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. This is reflected in Christian tradition, notably in the twelve Apostles. When Judas Iscariot is disgraced, a meeting is held (Acts) to add Saint Matthias to complete the number twelve once more.
The Book of Revelation contains much numerical symbolism, and many of the numbers mentioned have 12 as a divisor. mentions a woman—interpreted as the people of Israel, the Church and the Virgin Mary—wearing a crown of twelve stars (representing each of the twelve tribes of Israel). Furthermore, there are 12,000 people sealed from each of the twelve tribes of Israel (the Tribe of Dan is omitted while Manasseh is mentioned), making a total of 144,000 (which is the square of 12 multiplied by a thousand).
* According to the New Testament, Jesus had twelve Apostles.
* The &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; count the interval between Christmas and Epiphany. 
* Eastern Orthodoxy observes twelve Great Feasts.

12 was the only number considered to be religiously divine in the 1600s causing many Catholics to wear 12 buttons to church every Sunday. Some extremely devout Catholics would always wear this number of buttons to any occasion on any type of clothing.
===Islam===
* Twelve Imams are the spiritual and political successors to the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the Twelver branch of Shia Islam.
* The hadith of the twelve successors is a widely-reported prophecy, attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad, predicting that there would be twelve successors after him.

==Timekeeping==
* The lunar year is 12 lunar months. Adding 11 or 12 days completes the solar year. 
* Most calendar systems – solar or lunar – have twelve months in a year.
* The Chinese use a 12-year cycle for time-reckoning called Earthly Branches.
* There are twelve hours in a half day, numbered one to twelve for both the &quot;ante meridiem&quot; (a.m.) and the &quot;post meridiem&quot; (p.m.). 12:00 p.m. is midday or noon, and 12:00 a.m. is midnight. 
* The basic units of time (60 seconds, 60 minutes, 24 hours) are evenly divisible by twelve into smaller units.

==In numeral systems==

==In science==
*Force 12 on the Beaufort wind force scale corresponds to the maximum wind speed of a hurricane.

==In sports==
* In both soccer and American football, the number 12 can be a symbolic reference to the fans because of the support they give to the 11 players on the field. Texas A&amp;M University reserves the number 12 jersey for a walk-on player who represents the original &quot;12th Man&quot;, a fan who was asked to play when the team&#x27;s reserves were low in a college American football game in 1922. Similarly, Bayern Munich, Hammarby, Feyenoord, Atlético Mineiro, Flamengo, Seattle Seahawks, Portsmouth and Cork City do not allow field players to wear the number 12 on their jersey because it is reserved for their supporters.
* In rugby league, one of the starting second-row forwards wears the number 12 jersey in most competitions. An exception is in the Super League, which uses static squad numbering.
* In rugby union, one of the starting centres, most often but not always the inside centre, wears the 12 shirt.

===Music===
====Music theory====
*Twelve is the number of pitch classes in an octave, not counting the duplicated (octave) pitch. Also, the total number of major keys, (not counting enharmonic equivalents) and the total number of minor keys (also not counting equivalents). This applies only to twelve tone equal temperament, the most common tuning used today in western influenced music.
*The twelfth is the interval of an octave and a fifth. Instruments such as the clarinet which behave as a stopped cylindrical pipe overblow at the twelfth.
*The twelve-tone technique (also dodecaphony) is a method of musical composition devised by Arnold Schoenberg. Music using the technique is called twelve-tone music.
*The twelve-bar blues is one of the most prominent chord progressions in popular music.

===Art theory===
* There are twelve basic hues in the color wheel: three primary colors (red, yellow, blue), three secondary colors (orange, green, purple) and six tertiary colors (names for these vary, but are intermediates between the primaries and secondaries).

==In other fields==

* There are 12 troy ounces in a troy pound (used for precious metals).
* Twelve of something is called a dozen.
* In the former British currency system, there were twelve pence in a shilling.
* In English, twelve is the number of greatest magnitude that has just one syllable.
* 12 is the last number featured on the analogue clock, and also the starting point of the transition from A.M. to P.M. hours or vice versa.
* There are twelve months within a year, with the last one being December.
* 12 inches in a foot.
* 12 is slang for Police officers because of the 10-12 Police radio code.

<text>== Name ==
&quot;Eleven&quot; derives from the Old English &#x27;, which is first attested in Bede&#x27;s late 9th-century &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;. It has cognates in every Germanic language (for example, German ), whose Proto-Germanic ancestor has been reconstructed as , from the prefix (adjectival &quot;one&quot;) and suffix , of uncertain meaning. It is sometimes compared with the Lithuanian &#x27;, though &quot;&quot; is used as the suffix for all numbers from 11 to 19.

The Old English form has closer cognates in Old Frisian, Saxon, and Norse, whose ancestor has been reconstructed as . This was formerly thought to be derived from Proto-Germanic (&quot;ten&quot;); it is now sometimes connected with or (&quot;left; remaining&quot;), with the implicit meaning that &quot;one is left&quot; after counting to ten.

== Mathematics ==

11 is a prime number, and a super-prime. 11 forms a twin prime with 13, and sexy pair with 5 and 17. 11 is also the first prime exponent that does not yield a Mersenne prime.

11 is part of a pair of Brown numbers. Only three such pairs of numbers are known. Rows in Pascal&#x27;s triangle can be seen as representation of powers of 11.

An 11-sided polygon is called a hendecagon, or &quot;undecagon&quot;. A regular hendecagon is the polygon with the fewest number of sides that is not able to be constructed with a straightedge, compass, and angle trisector.

The Mathieu group formula_1 is the smallest of twenty-six sporadic groups. It has order formula_2, with 11 as its largest prime factor. formula_1 is the maximal subgroup Mathieu group formula_4, where 11 is also its largest prime factor.

=== List of basic calculations ===


== Music ==

The interval of an octave plus a fourth is an 11th. A complete 11th chord has almost every note of a diatonic scale.

== Cultural references ==

=== Film ===
In the mockumentary film &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, the idiomatic phrase up to eleven is coined to allude to going beyond the limitations of a system, in this case music amplifier volume levels.

=== &quot;Eleventh hour&quot; ===
Being one hour before 12:00, the &quot;eleventh hour&quot; means the last possible moment to take care of something, and often implies a situation of urgent danger or emergency (see Doomsday clock). &quot;The eleventh hour&quot; is a phrase in the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard in the Bible.

== Languages ==
While 11 has its own name in Germanic languages such as English, German, or Swedish, and some Latin-based languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, and French, it is the first compound number in many other languages: Chinese , Korean or .

== Mysticism ==
The number 11 (alongside its multiples 22 and 33) are master numbers in numerology, especially in New Age.

<text>3 (three) is a number, numeral and digit. It is the natural number following 2 and preceding 4, and is the smallest odd prime number and the only prime preceding a square number. It has religious and cultural significance in many societies.

==Evolution of the Arabic digit==

The use of three lines to denote the number 3 occurred in many writing systems, including some (like Roman and Chinese numerals) that are still in use. That was also the original representation of 3 in the Brahmic (Indian) numerical notation, its earliest forms aligned vertically. However, during the Gupta Empire the sign was modified by the addition of a curve on each line. The Nāgarī script rotated the lines clockwise, so they appeared horizontally, and ended each line with a short downward stroke on the right. In cursive script, the three strokes were eventually connected to form a glyph resembling a with an additional stroke at the bottom: ३. 

The Indian digits spread to the Caliphate in the 9th century. The bottom stroke was dropped around the 10th century in the western parts of the Caliphate, such as the Maghreb and Al-Andalus, when a distinct variant (&quot;Western Arabic&quot;) of the digit symbols developed, including modern Western 3. In contrast, the Eastern Arabs retained and enlarged that stroke, rotating the digit once more to yield the modern (&quot;Eastern&quot;) Arabic digit &quot;٣&quot;.

In most modern Western typefaces, the digit 3, like the other decimal digits, has the height of a capital letter, and sits on the baseline. In typefaces with text figures, on the other hand, the glyph usually has the height of a lowercase letter &quot;x&quot; and a descender: &quot;&quot;. In some French text-figure typefaces, though, it has an ascender instead of a descender.
A common graphic variant of the digit three has a flat top, similar to the letter Ʒ (ezh). This form, sometimes called a banker&#x27;s 3, can stop a forger from turning the 3 into an 8. It is found on UPC-A barcodes and standard 52-card decks.

== Mathematics ==
=== Divisibility rule ===
A natural number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits in base 10 is also divisible by 3. This known as the divisibility rule of 3. Because of this, the reverse of any number that is divisible by three (or indeed, any permutation of its digits) is also divisible by three. This divisibility rule works in any positional numeral system whose base divided by three leaves a remainder of one (bases 4, 7, 10, etc.).

=== Properties ===
3 is the second smallest prime number and the first odd prime number. 3 is a twin prime with 5, and a cousin prime with 7.

A triangle is made of three sides. It is the smallest non-self-intersecting polygon and the only polygon not to have proper diagonals. When doing quick estimates, 3 is a rough approximation of , 3.1415..., and a very rough approximation of &quot;e&quot;, 2.71828...

3 is the first Mersenne prime. 3 is also the first of five known Fermat primes. It is the second Fibonacci prime (and the second Lucas prime), the second Sophie Germain prime, and the second factorial prime. 

3 is the second and only prime triangular number, and Gauss proved that every integer is the sum of at most 3 triangular numbers.

Three is the only prime which is one less than a perfect square. Any other number which is formula_1 − 1 for some integer formula_2 is not prime, since it is (formula_2 − 1)(formula_2 + 1). This is true for 3 as well (with formula_2 = 2), but in this case the smaller factor is 1. If formula_2 is greater than 2, both formula_2 − 1 and formula_2 + 1 are greater than 1 so their product is not prime.

=== Numeral systems ===
There is some evidence to suggest that early man may have used counting systems which consisted of &quot;One, Two, Three&quot; and thereafter &quot;Many&quot; to describe counting limits. Early peoples had a word to describe the quantities of one, two, and three but any quantity beyond was simply denoted as &quot;Many&quot;. This is most likely based on the prevalence of this phenomenon among people in such disparate regions as the deep Amazon and Borneo jungles, where western civilization&#x27;s explorers have historical records of their first encounters with these indigenous people.

=== List of basic calculations ===


==Engineering==
*The triangle, a polygon with three edges and three vertices, is the most stable physical shape. For this reason it is widely utilized in construction, engineering and design.

===Pseudoscience===
*Three is the symbolic representation for Mu, Augustus Le Plongeon&#x27;s and James Churchward&#x27;s lost continent.

==Religion and beliefs==


Many world religions contain triple deities or concepts of trinity, including the Hindu Trimurti and Tridevi, the Triglav (lit. &quot;Three-headed one&quot;), the chief god of the Slavs, the three Jewels of Buddhism, the three Pure Ones of Taoism, the Christian Holy Trinity, and the Triple Goddess of Wicca.

According to Pythagoras and the Pythagorean school, the number 3, which they called &quot;triad&quot;, is the only number to equal the sum of all the terms below it, and the only number whose sum with those below equals the product of them and itself.

===As a lucky or unlucky number===
Three (, formal writing: , pinyin &quot;sān&quot;, Cantonese: &quot;saam&quot;1) is considered a good number in Chinese culture because it sounds like the word &quot;alive&quot; ( pinyin &quot;shēng&quot;, Cantonese: &quot;saang&quot;1), compared to four (, pinyin: &quot;sì&quot;, Cantonese: &quot;sei&quot;1), which sounds like the word &quot;death&quot; ( pinyin &quot;sǐ&quot;, Cantonese: &quot;sei&quot;2).

The phrase &quot;Third time&#x27;s the charm&quot; refers to the superstition that after two failures in any endeavor, a third attempt is more likely to succeed. However, some superstitions say the opposite, stating that luck, especially bad luck, is often said to &quot;come in threes&quot;.

One such superstition, called &quot;Three on a Match&quot;, says that it is unlucky to be the third person to light a cigarette from the same match or lighter. This superstition is sometimes asserted to have originated among soldiers in the trenches of the First World War when a sniper might see the first light, take aim on the second and fire on the third.

<text>7 (seven) is the natural number following 6 and preceding 8. It is the only prime number preceding a cube.

As an early prime number in the series of positive integers, the number seven has greatly symbolic associations in religion, mythology, superstition and philosophy. The seven classical planets resulted in seven being the number of days in a week. 7 is often considered lucky in Western culture and is often seen as highly symbolic.

==Evolution of the Arabic digit==
For early Brahmi numerals, 7 was written more or less in one stroke as a curve that looks like an uppercase vertically inverted (ᒉ). The western Arab peoples&#x27; main contribution was to make the longer line diagonal rather than straight, though they showed some tendencies to making the digit more rectilinear. The eastern Arab peoples developed the digit from a form that looked something like 6 to one that looked like an uppercase V. Both modern Arab forms influenced the European form, a two-stroke form consisting of a horizontal upper stroke joined at its right to a stroke going down to the bottom left corner, a line that is slightly curved in some font variants. As is the case with the European digit, the Cham and Khmer digit for 7 also evolved to look like their digit 1, though in a different way, so they were also concerned with making their 7 more different. For the Khmer this often involved adding a horizontal line to the top of the digit. This is analogous to the horizontal stroke through the middle that is sometimes used in handwriting in the Western world but which is almost never used in computer fonts. This horizontal stroke is, however, important to distinguish the glyph for seven from the glyph for one in writing that uses a long upstroke in the glyph for 1. In some Greek dialects of the early 12th century the longer line diagonal was drawn in a rather semicircular transverse line. 

On seven-segment displays, 7 is the digit with the most common graphic variation (1, 6 and 9 also have variant glyphs). Most devices use three line segments, but devices made by some Japanese companies such as Sharp and Casio, as well as in the Koreas and Taiwan, 7 is written with four line segments because in those countries, 7 is written with a &quot;hook&quot; on the left, as ① in the following illustration. Further segments can give further variation. For example, Schindler elevators in the United States and Canada installed or modernized from the late 1990s onwards usually use a sixteen segment display and show the digit 7 in a manner more similar to that of handwriting.

While the shape of the character for the digit 7 has an ascender in most modern typefaces, in typefaces with text figures the character usually has a descender (⁊), as, for example, in .

Most people in Continental Europe, Indonesia, and some in Britain, Ireland, Israel, Canada, and Latin America, write 7 with a line through the middle (), sometimes with the top line crooked. The line through the middle is useful to clearly differentiate the digit from the digit one, as they can appear similar when written in certain styles of handwriting. This form is used in official handwriting rules for primary school in Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Poland, other Slavic countries, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Romania, Germany, Greece, and Hungary.

==In mathematics==
Seven, the fourth prime number, is not only a Mersenne prime (since formula_1) but also a double Mersenne prime since the exponent, 3, is itself a Mersenne prime. It is also a Newman–Shanks–Williams prime, a Woodall prime, a factorial prime, a Harshad number, a lucky prime, a happy number (happy prime), a safe prime (the only ), a Leyland number of the second kind and Leyland prime of the second kind and the fourth Heegner number. Seven is the lowest natural number that cannot be represented as the sum of the squares of three integers.

A seven-sided shape is a heptagon. The regular &quot;n&quot;-gons for &quot;n&quot; ⩽ 6 can be constructed by compass and straightedge alone, which makes the heptagon the first regular polygon that cannot be directly constructed with these simple tools.

7 is the only number &quot;D&quot; for which the equation has more than two solutions for &quot;n&quot; and &quot;x&quot; natural. In particular, the equation is known as the Ramanujan–Nagell equation. 7 is one of seven numbers in the positive definite quadratic integer matrix representative of all odd numbers: {1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 33}.

There are 7 frieze groups in two dimensions, consisting of symmetries of the plane whose group of translations is isomorphic to the group of integers. These are related to the 17 wallpaper groups whose transformations and isometries repeat two-dimensional patterns in the plane.

A heptagon in Euclidean space is unable to generate uniform tilings alongside other polygons, like the regular pentagon. However, it is one of fourteen polygons that can fill a plane-vertex tiling, in its case only alongside a regular triangle and a 42-sided polygon (3.7.42). This is also one of twenty-one such configurations from seventeen combinations of polygons, that features the largest and smallest polygons possible. Otherwise, for any regular &quot;n&quot;-sided polygon, the maximum number of intersecting diagonals (other than through its center) is at most 7.

In two dimensions, there are precisely seven 7-uniform &quot;Krotenheerdt&quot; tilings, with no other such &quot;k&quot;-uniform tilings for &quot;k&quot; &gt; 7, and it is also the only &quot;k&quot; for which the count of &quot;Krotenheerdt&quot; tilings agrees with &quot;k&quot;.

The Fano plane, the smallest possible finite projective plane, has 7 points and 7 lines arranged such that every line contains 3 points and 3 lines cross every point. This is related to other appearances of the number seven in relation to exceptional objects, like the fact that the octonions contain seven distinct square roots of −1, seven-dimensional vectors have a cross product, and the number of equiangular lines possible in seven-dimensional space is anomalously large.

The lowest known dimension for an exotic sphere is the seventh dimension.

In hyperbolic space, 7 is the highest dimension for non-simplex hypercompact &quot;Vinberg polytopes&quot; of rank &quot;n + 4&quot; mirrors, where there is one unique figure with eleven facets. On the other hand, such figures with rank &quot;n + 3&quot; mirrors exist in dimensions 4, 5, 6 and 8; &quot;not&quot; in 7.

There are seven fundamental types of catastrophes.

When rolling two standard six-sided dice, seven has a 1 in 6 probability of being rolled, the greatest of any number. The opposite sides of a standard six-sided die always add to 7.

The Millennium Prize Problems are seven problems in mathematics that were stated by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000. Currently, six of the problems remain unsolved.

===Basic calculations===


====Decimal calculations====

 divided by 7 is exactly . Therefore, when a vulgar fraction with 7 in the denominator is converted to a decimal expansion, the result has the same six-digit repeating sequence after the decimal point, but the sequence can start with any of those six digits. In decimal representation, the reciprocal of 7 repeats six digits (as 0.), whose sum when cycling back to 1 is equal to 28.

== In science ==

===In psychology===
* Seven, plus or minus two as a model of working memory
* In Western culture, seven is consistently listed as people&#x27;s favorite number
* When guessing numbers 1–10, the number 7 is most likely to be picked
* Seven-year itch, a term that suggests that happiness in a marriage declines after around seven years

==Classical antiquity==

The Pythagoreans invested particular numbers with unique spiritual properties. The number seven was considered to be particularly interesting because it consisted of the union of the physical (number 4) with the spiritual (number 3). In Pythagorean numerology the number 7 means spirituality.

==Culture==
The number seven had mystical and religious significance in Mesopotamian culture by the 22nd century BCE at the latest. This was likely because in the Sumerian sexagesimal number system, dividing by seven was the first division which resulted in infinitely repeating fractions.

<doc id="208160" wikidata="Q211462" url="?curid=208160" title="Brandon Lee">
<text>Brandon Bruce Lee (February 1, 1965 – March 31, 1993) was an American actor. Establishing himself as a rising action star in the early 1990s, he landed what was to be his breakthrough role as Eric Draven in the supernatural superhero film &quot;The Crow&quot; (1994). However, Lee&#x27;s career and life were cut short by his accidental death during the film&#x27;s production.

Lee was the son of martial artist and film star Bruce Lee, who died when Brandon was eight years old. Lee, who followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps, trained in martial arts, including Jeet Kun Do, Wing Chun, Eskrima, Silat, and Muay Thai, and studied acting at Emerson College and the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. He started his career with leading roles in the Hong Kong action film &quot;Legacy of Rage&quot; (1986), and the straight-to-video &quot;Laser Mission&quot; (1989), which was a financial success on home video. Lee also appeared in two spin-offs of the 1970s series &quot;Kung Fu,&quot; the television film &quot;Kung Fu: The Movie&quot; (1986) and the pilot &quot;Kung Fu: The Next Generation&quot; (1987).

Transitioning to Hollywood productions, Lee first starred in the Warner Bros buddy cop film &quot;Showdown in Little Tokyo&quot; (1991), co-starring Dolph Lundgren. While it did not do well with audiences and critics upon its release, it later became a cult film. This was followed by a leading role in &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; (1992), produced by 20th Century Fox. Lee, alongside Jeff Imada, is also credited for the fight choreography, which contained elements of Jeet Kune Do. Though the film was not well-received, critics praised Lee&#x27;s onscreen presence. 

After being cast to headline &quot;The Crow&quot;, Lee had filmed nearly all of his scenes when he was fatally wounded on set by a prop gun. Lee posthumously received praise for his performance, while the film became a critical and commercial success. His career has drawn parallels with his father’s, both men having died young prior to the release of their breakthrough films.

==Early life==

Brandon was born on February 1, 1965, at East Oakland Hospital in Oakland, California, the son of martial artist and actor Bruce Lee (1940–1973) and Linda Lee Cadwell (née Emery). From a young age, Lee learned martial arts from his father, who was a well known practitioner and a martial arts movie star. Lee said the family lived between Hong Kong and the United States, due to his father&#x27;s career. While visiting his father&#x27;s sets, Lee became interested in acting. Lee&#x27;s father died suddenly in 1973, leaving a legacy that made him an icon of martial arts and cinema. Grace Ho (Lee&#x27;s grandmother) said that by the age of 5, he could kick through an inch board.

Afterwards, Lee&#x27;s family moved back to California. Lee began studying with Dan Inosanto, one of his father&#x27;s students, when he was 9. Later in his youth, Lee also trained with Richard Bustillo and Jeff Imada. Imada said that when Lee was in his teens, he struggled with his identity, and having to train in dojos which included large photos of his father troubled him. According to Imada, this led Lee to leave martial arts in favor of soccer. Both would reconnect later in their film careers, with Imada working as stunt and fight coordinator in several of Lee&#x27;s upcoming films. Meanwhile, Lee was a rebellious high school student. In 1983, four months prior to his graduation, Lee was asked to leave the Chadwick School for misbehavior. That year Lee received his GED from Miraleste High School.&quot;&quot;

Lee pursued his studies in New York City, where he took acting lessons at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. Lee went on to Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts, where he majored in theater. During this time, Lee appeared in several stage productions. He was part of the Eric Morris American New Theatre, with them he acted in John Lee Hancock&#x27;s play &quot;Full Fed Beast.&quot;

==Career==

===1985 to 1990: Early roles===
Lee returned to Los Angeles in 1985 and worked as a script reader. During this period, he was approached by casting director Lynn Stalmaster and successfully auditioned for his first credited acting role in &quot;Kung Fu: The Movie.&quot; It was a feature-length television movie that was a follow-up to the 1970s television series &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, with David Carradine returning as the lead. On set Lee reconnected with his former instructor Jeff Imada who worked in the stunt department. Imada said Lee had to be talked into accepting the role, since the martial arts nature of the film did not appeal to Lee, who avoided any connection with his father&#x27;s genre of film.&quot;&quot; In the film, the character of Kwai Chang Caine (Carradine) has a conflict with his illegitimate son (Lee). &quot;Kung Fu: The Movie&quot; first aired on ABC on February 1, 1986. Lee said that he felt there was some justice in being cast for this role in his first feature, since the TV show&#x27;s pilot had been conceived for his father.

That year saw the release of Ronny Yu&#x27;s Hong Kong action crime thriller &quot;Legacy of Rage.&quot; This was Lee&#x27;s first leading film role. Yu said that Lee and him did not get along during shooting. In the film, Lee plays a young man blamed for a crime he did not commit. It was the only film Lee made in Hong Kong, and in Cantonese. Lee was nominated for a Hong Kong Film Award for Best New Performer in this role. The film was a critical success at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival, and was a commercial success in Japan&quot;.&quot;

In 1987, Lee starred in another spin-off of &quot;Kung Fu,&quot; the unsold television pilot &quot;Kung Fu: The Next Generation.&quot; On June 19, it aired on &quot;CBS Summer Playhouse,&quot; a program that specialized in rejected pilots and allowed the audience to call in to vote for a show to be picked up as a series&quot;.&quot; The plot centered on the grandson and great-grandson (Lee) of the main character from the original series. The pilot was poorly received and not picked up as a series.

In 1988, Lee had a role in &quot;What&#x27;s In a Name&quot;, an episode of the American television series &quot;Ohara&quot;, starring Pat Morita, He portrayed the main villain, the son of a yakuza. Jeff Imada, who worked as stunt coordinator, said that Lee was recommended not to do the role due to the nature of the character. However, Lee saw it as a chance to expand his acting range, and took the role.&quot;&quot;

In 1990, &quot;Laser Mission&quot; was released. Filmed in Namibia, Lee stars as mercenary on a mission. Distributed by Turner Home Entertainment, it was a commercial success on home video. The film was generally panned by critics, although a few considered it an amusing action B movie.

In the 1980s, Lee started to train again with Dan Inosanto. Inosanto said that Lee would bring a camera to the training facilities to see which techniques looked good on screen. Also around this time, Margaret Loesch, Marvel&#x27;s CEO from 1984 to 1990, had a meeting with Lee and his mother through comic book writer Stan Lee (no relation). Stan Lee felt that Brandon would be ideal in the role of super-hero Shang-Chi in a film or television adaptation.

===1991 to 1993: Hollywood breakthrough===
In April 1991, Lee was in Universal Pictures&#x27; list of contenders to play his father in the biopic &quot;&quot; (1993). He turned the role down, finding it awkward to play his father, and too strange to approach the romance between his parents. Also, producer Raffaella De Laurentiis said he did not look Chinese enough and that she would have refused to work on the project if they had to resort to making Brandon appear more Asian. The role went to Jason Scott Lee (no relation), who said he was initially intimidated by his role as Bruce Lee but that he overcame his fear after speaking to Brandon. According to Jason, Brandon told him the following in regards to the role: &quot;He said I wouldn&#x27;t survive in this part if I treated his father like a god. He said his father was, after all, a man who had a profound destiny, but he was not a god. He was a man who had a temper, a lot of anger, who found mediocrity offensive. Sometimes he was rather merciless.&quot; Director Rob Cohen said he spent hours talking to Brandon during preparations.On August 23, 1991, Mark L. Lester&#x27;s &quot;Showdown in Little Tokyo&quot; premiered, which Warner Bros. produced and distributed. Lee starred opposite Dolph Lundgren in the buddy cop action film. Lee secured his role on October 13, 1990, to make his American feature debut. It was meant to start shooting after his casting but was delayed until the following January. In the film, Lee and Lundgren play cops who are partnered to investigate yakuza. In the US, the domestic gross was $2,275,557. The movie faced largely negative reviews; retrospectively, however, some critics find it entertaining for its genre.

While visiting Sweden, Lee was among the cameos in the locally made genre film &quot;Sex, Lögner och Videovåld&quot; (2002), filmed between 1990 and 1993. The film was completed in 2000.

Lee&#x27;s next film was 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;, which premiered on August 22, 1992, and was directed by Dwight H. Little. Lee plays a student named Jake Lo who witnesses a murder and is put in a witness protection program. The film came about when producer Robert Lawrence started working with Lee and noticed his potential to be an action leading man in Hollywood after screening Lee&#x27;s earlier project &quot;Legacy of Rage&quot;. Lee was involved with the story development, and connected with the plot point where his character loses his father. Jeff Imada, the film&#x27;s stunt coordinator, witnessed Lee bringing a book of work by his father to emotionally prepare himself in the scene where the character loses his dad. Imada also said Lee put on muscle for the role. Lee and Imada are credited for the fight choreography, the fighting style contain elements of Lee father&#x27;s Jeet Kune Do. Lee was allowed to add some touches of his own humor to the script. On playing the character of Jake Lo, Lee said &quot;I always saw that character as not being gung-ho to get himself involved in those situations. I wanted to keep that throughout the film, that sarcastic edge. So he&#x27;s not just becoming Joe Action Hero.&quot; In the US, the film is debuted at No.3 at the box office, making $4,815,850. After its 19 weeks run in cinemas, it made a total of $14,356,479. Most critics did not like the film, but many of them found Lee charismatic. A minority of critics found &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; to be slick, well acted, and a serviceable action film. Also that year, it was reported that Lee signed a three-picture deal with 20th Century Fox and a multi-picture deal with Carolco Pictures. That year, according to John Lee Hancock, Lee read the first draft of &quot;The Little Things&quot; (2021), and was interested to act in it.

In the fall, while doing publicity for &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;, Lee landed the lead role in Alex Proyas&#x27; &quot;The Crow&quot;, an adaptation of a comic book by the same name. It tells the story of Eric Draven (Lee), a rock musician raised from the dead by a supernatural crow to avenge his own death as well as the rape and murder of his fiancée by a dangerous gang in his city. According to producer Jeff Most, Lee had good insight on the character and liked the lyrical lines within the script, but did not want the dialogue to spread aimlessly. Hence, Lee focused on the brevity and rhythm of the lines of dialogue to make the character threatening. In preparation for the fight sequence, Most said that director Proyas and Lee studied martial arts movies. Also according to Most, Lee did not want metaphysical characters besides his own in the film. Costumer Roberta Bile said that Lee modelled Draven after singer Chris Robinson. Lee convinced the team to hire Jeff Imada who became the stunt coordinator; he and Imada oversaw the fight choreography.

Imada and Lee agreed that the character of Eric Draven would not do conventional martial arts moves; his movements would be unique. He is a character without formal martial arts training who was given supernatural abilities upon resurrection. With this in mind, they added aerobics to Draven&#x27;s fighting style. Both Imada and Most said Lee was pleased to incorporate his martial arts to the design of the character, without it being part of the story. Imada said that in order to look like a rocker and not an action hero, Lee went on a strict diet weeks before shooting in order to remove a lot of bulk, and would even weigh the food he ate. Lee also focused on cardiovascular exercise with a stairmaster, did repetitions on lighter weights to elongate and stretch his muscles, and did aerobics to lose body fat rapidly. During pre-production, Imada said that in order to get into character for the resurrection, Lee bought bags of ice in which he submerged himself, because Lee hypothesized that the feeling of resurrection must be freezing cold. The resurrection scene was shot the first night of production, during the winter. Imada was surprised that Lee requested the bags of ice because of the weather, and the fact that he was already barefoot and bare-naked. Key hairstylist Michelle Johnson said that in rain scenes Lee would soak himself prior to filming the scenes, where he would act without a shirt in cold weather. The film crew was impressed with his performance and dedication.

On March 31, 1993, while filming &quot;The Crow&quot;, Lee suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the abdomen on set. A .44 Magnum revolver loaded with blanks was pointed at him and fired as part of a scene, but the props staff had not checked the gun to ensure that it was safe to use. The projectile from a live round had become wedged in the barrel some time earlier; when the blank was fired, it generated enough force to push the projectile out at lethal velocity.

===1993 to present: Posthumous success===
After Lee&#x27;s death in 1993, his fiancée Eliza Hutton and his mother supported director Proyas&#x27; decision to complete &quot;The Crow&quot;. At the time of Lee&#x27;s death, only eight days were left before completion of the movie. A majority of the film had already been completed with Lee, and he was only required to shoot scenes for three more days. To complete the film, stunt doubles Chad Stahelski and Jeff Cadiente served as stand-ins; special effects were used to give them Lee&#x27;s face. Lee&#x27;s on-set death paved the way for deceased actors to complete or have new performances, since pioneering CGI techniques were used to complete &quot;The Crow&quot;. A month later, it was reported that Lee&#x27;s previous films &quot;Laser Mission&quot;, &quot;Showdown in Little Tokyo&quot;, and &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; saw a surge in video sales. On April 28, &quot;&quot; premiered at the Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. The film is dedicated to Brandon with the quote: &quot;The key to immortality is first living a life worth remembering.&quot; The event was considered a celebration of both Brandon and his father Bruce. Brandon&#x27;s mother Linda and sister Shannon attended the premiere. Linda found the film to be excellent and a great tribute to her whole family.

In 1994, &quot;The Crow&quot; opened at number one in the United States in 1,573 theaters grossing $11.7 million, averaging $7,485 per theater. The film ultimately grossed $50.7 million, above its $23 million budget, 24th among all films released in the U.S. that year and 10th among R-rated films released that year. It was the most successful film of Lee&#x27;s career, and is considered a cult classic. The film is dedicated to him and his fiancée Eliza Hutton. &quot;The Crow&quot; has an approval rating of 82 percent on Rotten Tomatoes based on 55 reviews; critical consensus there is: &quot;Filled with style and dark, lurid energy, &quot;The Crow&quot; is an action-packed visual feast that also has a soul in the performance of the late Brandon Lee.&quot; &quot;The Crow&quot; has a score of 71 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;Generally favorable reviews&quot;. Reviewers praised the action and visual style. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it a &quot;dazzling fever dream of a movie&quot;; Caryn James, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called it &quot;a genre film of a high order, stylish and smooth&quot;; Roger Ebert called it &quot;a stunning work of visual style&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also praised the film. Lee&#x27;s death was alleged to have a melancholic effect on viewers; Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Lee &quot;haunts every frame&quot; and James Berardinelli called the film &quot;a case of &#x27;art imitating death&#x27;, and that specter will always hang over &quot;The Crow&quot;&quot;.

Jessica Seigel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; found that Lee never quite left the shadow of his father and that &quot;The Crow&quot; did not live up to Lee&#x27;s full unexploited potential. Amber McKee of the &quot;Park Record&quot; considered it a good film but an eerie conclusion to Lee&#x27;s career, since he had wanted to escape the action genre and move on to dramatic roles. Berardinelli called it an appropriate epitaph to Lee, Howe called it an appropriate sendoff, and Ebert stated that not only was this Lee&#x27;s best film, it was also better than any of his father&#x27;s.&quot;The Crow&quot; retained a loyal following many years after its release. Due to the source material and Lee&#x27;s fate, it is often described as a goth cult film.

In 1998, &quot;Legacy of Rage&quot; was released in the US to Home media, and Australia the next year. The film has been described as stylistic and fast-paced, with a good performance by Lee.

==Death==
On March 31, 1993, Lee was filming a scene for the film &quot;The Crow&quot; in which his character is shot and killed by thugs. In the scene, Lee&#x27;s character walks into his apartment and discovers his fiancée being beaten and raped, and a thug played by actor Michael Massee fires a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 629 .44 Magnum revolver at Lee&#x27;s character as he walks into the room.

In a film shoot prior to the fatal scene, the gun that was used as a prop (a real revolver) was loaded with improperly made dummy rounds, improvised from live cartridges that had the powder charges removed by the special effects crew, so in close-ups the revolver would show normal-looking ammunition. However, the crew neglected to remove the primers from the cartridges, and at some point before the fatal event, one of the rounds had been fired. Although there were no powder charges, the energy from the ignited primer was enough to separate the bullet from the casing and push it part-way into the gun barrel, where it got stuck—a dangerous condition known as a squib load.

During the fatal scene, which called for the revolver to be fired at Lee from a distance of , the dummy cartridges were replaced with blank rounds, which contained a powder charge and the primer, but no solid bullet, allowing the gun to be fired with sound and flash effects without the risk of an actual projectile. However, the gun was not properly checked and cleared before the blank was fired, and the dummy bullet previously lodged in the barrel was then propelled forward by the blank&#x27;s propellant and shot out the muzzle with almost the same force as if the round were live, striking Lee in the abdomen.

After Massee pulled the trigger and shot Lee, Lee fell backwards instead of forwards as he was supposed to. When the director said &quot;cut&quot;, Lee did not stand up and the crew thought he was either still acting or joking. Jeff Imada, who immediately checked Lee, noticed something wrong when he came close and noted Lee was unconscious and breathing heavily. Medic Clyde Baisey went to Lee and shook him to see if he was dazed by hitting his head during the fall, but did not think Lee had been shot since there was no visible bleeding. Baisey took Lee&#x27;s pulse, which was regular, but within two to three minutes it slowed down dramatically, and stopped.

Lee was rushed to the New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington, North Carolina. Attempts to save him were unsuccessful and after six hours of emergency surgery, Lee was pronounced dead on March 31, 1993, at 1:03 pm. He was 28 years old. The shooting was ruled an accident due to negligence. Lee&#x27;s death led to the re-emergence of conspiracy theories surrounding his father&#x27;s similarly early death. Lee was buried next to his father at the Lake View Cemetery in Seattle, Washington. A private funeral attended by 50 took place in Seattle on April 3. The following day, 200 of Lee&#x27;s family and business associates attended a memorial service at actress Polly Bergen&#x27;s house in Los Angeles. Among the attendees were Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, David Hasselhoff, Steven Seagal, David Carradine, and Melissa Etheridge.

In August 1993, Lee&#x27;s mother, Linda Lee Cadwell, filed a lawsuit against the filmmakers alleging negligence in the death of her son. The suit was settled two months later under undisclosed terms.

In an interview just prior to his death, Lee quoted a passage from Paul Bowles&#x27; book &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; which he had chosen for his wedding invitations; it is now inscribed on his tombstone:

== Martial arts and philosophy ==
Lee was trained from a young age by his father Bruce Lee in martial arts. During this time, martial artist Bob Wall, a friend and collaborator of Bruce, observed that Lee hit with power and had good footwork. At age eight, after his father&#x27;s death, Bruce&#x27;s disciple Dan Inosanto trained Lee. According to Jeff Imada who at the time was helping with children&#x27;s classes at Inosanto&#x27;s Kali Institute, the fact that he was the son of one of its founders was kept quiet; Lee had difficulty focusing due to seeing his father&#x27;s photos taking so much space in his studio. Imada said Lee stopped training in his mid-teens to play soccer.&quot;&quot; Richard Bustillo also trained Lee during his teens and said that Lee worked hard and was always respectful. Lee said that with his training Arnis with Inosanto he specialized in both Kali and Escrima and lasted three to four years.

In 1986, Lee said that he was training in Yee Chuan Tao, a relaxation-based martial art, with a trainer named Mike Vendrell. Lee said that it consisted of exercises such as slow sparring, Chi sao practice; they also worked on a wooden dummy, as well as Vendrell swinging a staff at him while he would duck or jump over. He said later that the exercise helped him be less tense.

Also in the 1980s, Lee returned to Dan Inosanto&#x27;s Academy. Lee said he did a few amateur fights but did not seek to compete in tournaments. He would bring a camera to Inosanto&#x27;s studio, both would choreograph fights for Lee&#x27;s films and would allow him to see how various moves played out on screen. During this time, Lee also trained in weapon-based martial arts such as Eskrima and Silat. In 1991, Lee was certified by the Thai Boxing Association. While his main goal was dramatic acting, he credited his skill in martial arts to have helped him to get roles that require it.

During the filming of &quot;The Crow&quot;, Lee said he did cardiovascular exercises to the point of exhaustion using a jump rope, running, riding a LifeCycle, or using a StairMaster, after which he would train at Inosanto&#x27;s academy where he took Muay Thai classes.

According to Lee&#x27;s mother, years prior to his death Lee became consumed with his father&#x27;s written philosophy, taking lengthy notes. When asked which martial arts he practiced, he responded:

In August 1992, Bruce Lee biographer John Little asked Brandon Lee what his philosophy in life was, and he replied, &quot;Eat—or die!&quot; Brandon later spoke of the martial arts and self-knowledge:

==Personal life==
Lee&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather was Ho Kom-Tong, a Chinese philanthropist who was the half-brother of businessman and philanthropist Sir Robert Ho Tung. Lee&#x27;s mother, Linda Emery, has Swedish and German ancestry. Lee&#x27;s father has been said to have &quot;proudly told everyone&quot; about his newborn son Brandon&#x27;s diverse features, describing him as perhaps the only Chinese person with blond hair and grey eyes. He was the brother of Shannon Lee.

According to Chuck Norris, a friend and collaborator of Lee&#x27;s father, he lived not far from their home in California and spent time with him as a child telling him about his father. Norris also explained that his son, Eric Norris, and Lee were childhood friends. John Lee Hancock said he had a friendship with Lee, who would read all of his scripts. Lee was also friends with George Clooney and Miguel Ferrer. Clooney stated, &quot;my cousin Miguel Ferrer was gonna be his best man the next week at their wedding. Brandon and I played ball and hung out at the Hollywood YMCA three days a week, we were buddies and this was his big break.&quot; Lee was also a friend of Chad Stahelski, his double after his death during &quot;The Crow&quot;. The two trained together at the Inosanto Martial Arts Academy.

In 1990, Lee met Eliza Hutton at director Renny Harlin&#x27;s office, where she was working as his personal assistant. Lee and Hutton moved in together in early 1991 and became engaged in October 1992. They planned to get married in Ensenada, Mexico, on April 17, 1993, a week after Lee was to complete filming on &quot;The Crow&quot;.

<text>4 (four) is a number, numeral and digit. It is the natural number following 3 and preceding 5. It is a square number, the smallest semiprime and composite number, and is considered unlucky in many East Asian cultures.

==Evolution of the Hindu-Arabic digit==


Brahmic numerals represented 1, 2, and 3 with as many lines. 4 was simplified by joining its four lines into a cross that looks like the modern plus sign. The Shunga would add a horizontal line on top of the digit, and the Kshatrapa and Pallava evolved the digit to a point where the speed of writing was a secondary concern. The Arabs&#x27; 4 still had the early concept of the cross, but for the sake of efficiency, was made in one stroke by connecting the &quot;western&quot; end to the &quot;northern&quot; end; the &quot;eastern&quot; end was finished off with a curve. The Europeans dropped the finishing curve and gradually made the digit less cursive, ending up with a digit very close to the original Brahmin cross.

While the shape of the character for the digit 4 has an ascender in most modern typefaces, in typefaces with text figures the glyph usually has a descender, as, for example, in .

On the seven-segment displays of pocket calculators and digital watches, as well as certain optical character recognition fonts, 4 is seen with an open top: .

Television stations that operate on channel 4 have occasionally made use of another variation of the &quot;open 4&quot;, with the open portion being on the side, rather than the top. This version resembles the Canadian Aboriginal syllabics letter ᔦ. The magnetic ink character recognition &quot;CMC-7&quot; font also uses this variety of &quot;4&quot;.

==Mathematics ==
There are four elementary arithmetic operations in mathematics: addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), and division (÷).

Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem states that every positive integer can be written as the sum of at most four squares. Four is one of four all-Harshad numbers. Each natural number divisible by 4 is a difference of squares of two natural numbers, i.e. formula_1.

A four-sided plane figure is a quadrilateral or quadrangle, sometimes also called a &quot;tetragon&quot;. It can be further classified as a rectangle or &quot;oblong&quot;, kite, rhombus, and square.

Four is the highest degree general polynomial equation for which there is a solution in radicals.

The four-color theorem states that a planar graph (or, equivalently, a flat map of two-dimensional regions such as countries) can be colored using four colors, so that adjacent vertices (or regions) are always different colors. Three colors are not, in general, sufficient to guarantee this. The largest planar complete graph has four vertices.

A solid figure with four faces as well as four vertices is a tetrahedron, which is the smallest possible number of faces and vertices a polyhedron can have. The regular tetrahedron, also called a 3-simplex, is the simplest Platonic solid. It has four regular triangles as faces that are themselves at dual positions with the vertices of another tetrahedron.

The smallest non-cyclic group has four elements; it is the Klein four-group. &quot;A&quot; alternating groups are not simple for values formula_2 ≤ formula_3.

There are four Hopf fibrations of hyperspheres:

formula_4

They are defined as locally trivial fibrations that map formula_5 for values of formula_6 (aside from the trivial fibration mapping between two points and a circle).

In Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation, formula_7, and so forth, for any number of up arrows.

==List of basic calculations==


==In culture==
*Four is the sacred number of the Zia, an indigenous tribe located in the U.S. state of New Mexico.
*The Chinese, the Koreans, and the Japanese are superstitious about the number four because it is a homonym for &quot;death&quot; in their languages.

==In logic and philosophy==

*The symbolic meanings of the number four are linked to those of the cross and the square. &quot;Almost from prehistoric times, the number four was employed to signify what was solid, what could be touched and felt. Its relationship to the cross (four points) made it an outstanding symbol of wholeness and universality, a symbol which drew all to itself&quot;. Where lines of latitude and longitude intersect, they divide the earth into four proportions. Throughout the world kings and chieftains have been called &quot;lord of the four suns&quot; or &quot;lord of the four quarters of the earth&quot;, which is understood to refer to the extent of their powers both territorially and in terms of total control of their subjects&#x27; doings. 
*The Square of Opposition, in both its Aristotelian version and its Boolean version, consists of four forms: A (&quot;All &quot;S&quot; is &quot;R&quot;&quot;), I (&quot;Some &quot;S&quot; is &quot;R&quot;&quot;), E (&quot;No &quot;S&quot; is &quot;R&quot;&quot;), and O (&quot;Some &quot;S&quot; is not &quot;R&quot;&quot;).

==In technology==
*In internet slang, &quot;4&quot; can replace the word &quot;for&quot; (as &quot;four&quot; and &quot;for&quot; are pronounced similarly). For example, typing &quot;4u&quot; instead of &quot;for you&quot;.
*In Leetspeak, &quot;4&quot; may be used to replace the letter &quot;A&quot;.

==Other groups of four==
*Approximately four weeks (4 times 7 days) to a lunar month (synodic month = 29.54 days). Thus the number four is universally an integral part of primitive sacred calendars.

<text>6 (six) is the natural number following 5 and preceding 7. It is a composite number and the smallest perfect number.

==In mathematics==
A six-sided polygon is a hexagon, one of the three regular polygons capable of tiling the plane. A hexagon also has 6 edges as well as 6 internal and external angles.

6 is the second smallest composite number. It is also the first number that is the sum of its proper divisors, making it the smallest perfect number. 6 is the first unitary perfect number, since it is the sum of its positive proper unitary divisors, without including itself. Only five such numbers are known to exist. 6 is the largest of the four all-Harshad numbers. 

6 is the 2nd superior highly composite number, the 2nd colossally abundant number, the 3rd triangular number, the 4th highly composite number, a pronic number, a congruent number, a harmonic divisor number, and a semiprime. 6 is also the first Granville number, or formula_1-perfect number. A Golomb ruler of length 6 is a &quot;perfect ruler&quot;.

The six exponentials theorem guarantees that under certain conditions one of a set of six exponentials is transcendental. The smallest non-abelian group is the symmetric group formula_2 which has 3! = 6 elements. 6 the answer to the two-dimensional kissing number problem.

A cube has 6 faces. A tetrahedron has 6 edges. In four dimensions, there are a total of six convex regular polytopes.

In the classification of finite simple groups, twenty of twenty-six sporadic groups in the happy family are part of three families of groups which divide the order of the friendly giant, the largest sporadic group: five &quot;first generation&quot; Mathieu groups, seven &quot;second generation&quot; subquotients of the Leech lattice, and eight &quot;third generation&quot; subgroups of the friendly giant. The remaining six sporadic groups do not divide the order of the friendly giant, which are termed the &quot;pariahs&quot; (&quot;Ly&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;N&quot;, &quot;Ru&quot;, &quot;J&quot;4, &quot;J&quot;3, and &quot;J&quot;1).

===List of basic calculations===


==Greek and Latin word parts==
 is classical Greek for &quot;six&quot;. Thus:
*&quot;Hexadecimal&quot; combines &#x27; with the Latinate &#x27; to name a number base of 16
*A hexagon is a regular polygon with six sides
**&quot;&quot; is a French nickname for the continental part of Metropolitan France for its resemblance to a regular hexagon
*A hexahedron is a polyhedron with six faces, with a cube being a special case
*Hexameter is a poetic form consisting of six feet per line
*A &quot;hex nut&quot; is a nut with six sides, and a hex bolt has a six-sided head
*The prefix &quot;&quot; also occurs in the systematic name of many chemical compounds, such as hexane which has 6 carbon atoms ().

===The prefix &quot;sex-&quot;===
Sex- is a Latin prefix meaning &quot;six&quot;. Thus:
*&quot;Senary&quot; is the ordinal adjective meaning &quot;sixth&quot;
*People with sexdactyly have six fingers on each hand
*The measuring instrument called a sextant got its name because its shape forms one-sixth of a whole circle
*A group of six musicians is called a sextet
*Six babies delivered in one birth are sextuplets
*Sexy prime pairs – Prime pairs differing by six are &quot;sexy&quot;, because sex is the Latin word for six.

The SI prefix for 10006 is exa- (E), and for its reciprocal atto- (a).

==Evolution of the Hindu-Arabic digit==
The evolution of our modern digit 6 appears rather simple when compared with the other digits. The modern 6 can be traced back to the Brahmi numerals of India, which are first known from the Edicts of Ashoka . It was written in one stroke like a cursive lowercase e rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Gradually, the upper part of the stroke (above the central squiggle) became more curved, while the lower part of the stroke (below the central squiggle) became straighter. The Arabs dropped the part of the stroke below the squiggle. From there, the European evolution to our modern 6 was very straightforward, aside from a flirtation with a glyph that looked more like an uppercase G.

On the seven-segment displays of calculators and watches, 6 is usually written with six segments. Some historical calculator models use just five segments for the 6, by omitting the top horizontal bar. This glyph variant has not caught on; for calculators that can display results in hexadecimal, a 6 that looks like a &quot;b&quot; is not practical.

Just as in most modern typefaces, in typefaces with text figures the character for the digit 6 usually has an ascender, as, for example, in .

This digit resembles an inverted &quot;9&quot;. To disambiguate the two on objects and documents that can be inverted, the 6 has often been underlined, both in handwriting and on printed labels.

==Chemistry==

*The sixfold symmetry of snowflakes arises from the hexagonal crystal structure of ordinary ice.

==Anthropology==
*A coffin is traditionally buried six feet under the ground; thus, the phrase &quot;six feet under&quot; means that a person (or thing, or concept) is dead
*Six is a lucky number in Chinese culture.
*&quot;Six&quot; is used as an informal slang term for the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6.

<text>8 (eight) is the natural number following 7 and preceding 9.

== Etymology ==
English &quot;eight&quot;, from Old English &quot;, æhta&quot;, Proto-Germanic &quot;*ahto&quot; is a direct continuation of Proto-Indo-European &quot;*oḱtṓ(w)-&quot;, and as such cognate with Greek and Latin , both of which stems are reflected by the English prefix oct(o)-, as in the ordinal adjective &quot;octaval&quot; or &quot;octavary&quot;, the distributive adjective is &quot;octonary&quot;.
The adjective &quot;octuple&quot; (Latin ) may also be used as a noun, meaning &quot;a set of eight items&quot;; the diminutive &quot;octuplet&quot; is mostly used to refer to eight siblings delivered in one birth.

The Semitic numeral is based on a root &quot;*θmn-&quot;, whence Akkadian &quot;smn-&quot;, Arabic &quot;ṯmn-&quot;, Hebrew &quot;šmn-&quot; etc.

The Chinese numeral, written (Mandarin: &quot;bā&quot;; Cantonese: &quot;baat&quot;), is from Old Chinese &quot;*priāt-&quot;, ultimately from Sino-Tibetan &quot;b-r-gyat&quot; or &quot;b-g-ryat&quot; which also yielded Tibetan &quot;brgyat&quot;.
It has been argued that, as the cardinal number is the highest number of items that can universally be cognitively processed as a single set, the etymology of the numeral &quot;eight&quot; might be the first to be considered composite, either as &quot;twice four&quot; or as &quot;two short of ten&quot;, or similar.
The Turkic words for &quot;eight&quot; are from a Proto-Turkic stem &quot;*sekiz&quot;, which has been suggested as originating as a negation of &quot;eki&quot; &quot;two&quot;, as in &quot;without two fingers&quot; (i.e., &quot;two short of ten; two fingers are not being held up&quot;);
this same principle is found in Finnic &quot;*kakte-ksa&quot;, which conveys a meaning of &quot;two before (ten)&quot;. The Proto-Indo-European reconstruction &quot;*oḱtṓ(w)-&quot; itself has been argued as representing an old dual, which would correspond to an original meaning of &quot;twice four&quot;.
Proponents of this &quot;quaternary hypothesis&quot; adduce the numeral &quot;&quot;, which might be built on the stem &quot;new-&quot;, meaning &quot;new&quot; (indicating the beginning of a &quot;new set of numerals&quot; after having counted to eight).

== Evolution of the Arabic digit ==


The modern digit 8, like all modern Arabic numerals other than zero, originates with the Brahmi numerals.
The Brahmi digit for &quot;eight&quot; by the 1st century was written in one stroke as a curve └┐ looking like an uppercase H with the bottom half of the left line and the upper half of the right line removed.
However, the digit for eight used in India in the early centuries of the Common Era developed considerable graphic variation, and in some cases took the shape of a single wedge, which was adopted into the Perso-Arabic tradition as ٨ (and also gave rise to the later Devanagari form ८); the alternative curved glyph also existed as a variant in Perso-Arabic tradition, where it came to look similar to our digit 5.

The digits as used in Al-Andalus by the 10th century were a distinctive western variant of the glyphs used in the Arabic-speaking world, known as &quot;ghubār&quot; numerals (&quot;ghubār&quot; translating to &quot;sand table&quot;). In these digits, the line of the &quot;5&quot;-like glyph used in Indian manuscripts for eight came to be formed in ghubār as a closed loop, which was the &quot;8&quot;-shape that became adopted into European use in the 10th century.

Just as in most modern typefaces, in typefaces with text figures the character for the digit 8 usually has an ascender, as, for example, in .

The infinity symbol ∞, described as a &quot;sideways figure eight&quot;, is unrelated to the digit 8 in origin; it is first used (in the mathematical meaning &quot;infinity&quot;) in the 17th century, and it may be derived from the Roman numeral for &quot;one thousand&quot; CIƆ, or alternatively from the final Greek letter, ω.

== In mathematics ==
8 is a composite number and the first number which is neither prime nor semiprime. By Mihăilescu&#x27;s Theorem, it is the only nonzero perfect power that is one less than another perfect power. 8 is the first proper Leyland number of the form , where in its case and both equal 2. 8 is a Fibonacci number and the only nontrivial Fibonacci number that is a perfect cube. Sphenic numbers always have exactly eight divisors. 8 is the base of the octal number system.

=== Geometry ===

A polygon with eight sides is an octagon. A regular octagon can fill a plane-vertex with a regular triangle and a regular icositetragon, as well as tessellate two-dimensional space alongside squares in the truncated square tiling. This tiling is one of eight Archimedean tilings that are semi-regular, or made of more than one type of regular polygon, and the only tiling that can admit a regular octagon. The Ammann–Beenker tiling is a nonperiodic tesselation of prototiles that feature prominent octagonal &quot;silver&quot; eightfold symmetry, that is the two-dimensional orthographic projection of the four-dimensional 8-8 duoprism.

An octahedron is a regular polyhedron with eight equilateral triangles as faces. is the dual polyhedron to the cube and one of eight convex deltahedra. The stella octangula, or &quot;eight-pointed star&quot;, is the only stellation with octahedral symmetry. It has eight triangular faces alongside eight vertices that forms a cubic faceting, composed of two self-dual tetrahedra that makes it the simplest of five regular compounds. The cuboctahedron, on the other hand, is a rectified cube or rectified octahedron, and one of only two convex quasiregular polyhedra. It contains eight equilateral triangular faces, whose first stellation is the cube-octahedron compound.

=== Vector spaces===

The octonions are a hypercomplex normed division algebra that are an extension of the complex numbers. They are a double cover of special orthogonal group SO(8). The special unitary group SO(3) has an eight-dimensional adjoint representation whose colors are ascribed gauge symmetries that represent the vectors of the eight gluons in the Standard Model. Clifford algebras display a periodicity of 8.

=== Group theory ===

The lie group E8 is one of 5 exceptional lie groups. The order of the smallest non-abelian group whose subgroups are all normal is 8.

=== List of basic calculations ===


== In science ==
=== Physics ===
* In nuclear physics, the second magic number.

=== Chemistry ===
* The most stable allotrope of a sulfur molecule is made of eight sulfur atoms arranged in a rhombic form.

== In technology ==

* A byte is eight bits.

== In culture ==

=== Currency ===
* Sailors and civilians alike from the 1500s onward referred to evenly divided parts of the Spanish dollar as &quot;pieces of eight&quot;, or &quot;bits&quot;.

=== In religion, folk belief and divination ===

==== Buddhism ====

In general, &quot;eight&quot; seems to be an auspicious number for Buddhists. The Dharmacakra, a Buddhist symbol, has eight spokes. The Buddha&#x27;s principal teaching—the Four Noble Truths—ramifies as the Noble Eightfold Path and the Buddha emphasizes the importance of the eight attainments or jhanas.

==== Islam ====

* The octagram &quot;Rub el Hizb&quot; is often used in Islamic symbology.

====As a lucky number====
* The number eight is considered to be a lucky number in Chinese and other Asian cultures. Eight (; accounting ; pinyin &quot;bā&quot;) is considered a lucky number in Chinese culture because it sounds like the word meaning to generate wealth (; Pinyin: &quot;fā&quot;). Property with the number 8 may be valued greatly by Chinese. For example, a Hong Kong number plate with the number 8 was sold for $640,000. The opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Beijing started at 8 seconds and 8 minutes past 8 pm (local time) on 8 August 2008.
* In Pythagorean numerology the number 8 represents victory, prosperity and overcoming.
* is also considered a lucky number in Japan, but the reason is different from that in Chinese culture. Eight gives an idea of growing prosperous, because the letter () broadens gradually.
* The Japanese thought of as a holy number in the ancient times. The reason is less well-understood, but it is thought that it is related to the fact they used eight to express large numbers vaguely such as (literally, eightfold and twentyfold), (literally, eight clouds), (literally, eight millions of Gods), etc. It is also guessed that the ancient Japanese gave importance to pairs, so some researchers guess twice as , which is also guessed to be a holy number in those times because it indicates the world (north, south, east, and west) might be considered a very holy number.
* In numerology, 8 is the number of building, and in some theories, also the number of destruction.

==== In astrology ====
* In the Middle Ages, 8 was the number of &quot;unmoving&quot; stars in the sky, and symbolized the perfection of incoming planetary energy.

=== In sports and other games ===

* In association football, the number 8 has historically been the number of the Central Midfielder.
* In baseball:
** The center fielder is designated as number 8 for scorekeeping purposes.
* In rugby league:
** Most competitions (though not the Super League, which uses static squad numbering) use a position-based player numbering system in which one of the two starting props wears the number 8.
* In the 2008 Games of the XXIX Olympiad held in Beijing, the official opening was on 08/08/08 at 8:08:08 p.m. CST.

=== In literature ===
* In Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; series, eight is a magical number and is considered taboo. Eight is not safe to be said by wizards on the Discworld and is the number of Bel-Shamharoth. Also, there are eight days in a Disc week and eight colours in a Disc spectrum, the eighth one being octarine.

=== In slang ===
* An &quot;eighth&quot; is a common measurement of marijuana, meaning an eighth of an ounce. It is also a common unit of sale for psilocybin mushrooms.
* In Colombia and Venezuela, &quot;volverse un ocho&quot; (meaning to tie oneself in a figure 8) refers to getting in trouble or contradicting oneself.
* In China, &quot;8&quot; is used in chat speak as a term for parting. This is due to the closeness in pronunciation of &quot;8&quot; (bā) and the English word &quot;bye&quot;.

===Other uses===
* A figure 8 is the common name of a geometric shape, often used in the context of sports, such as skating. Figure-eight turns of a rope or cable around a cleat, pin, or bitt are used to belay something.

<text>Marathon Man is a 1974 conspiracy thriller novel by William Goldman. It was Goldman&#x27;s most successful thriller novel, and his second suspense novel.

In 1976 it was made into a film of the same name, with a screenplay by Goldman, starring Dustin Hoffman, Laurence Olivier, and Roy Scheider and directed by John Schlesinger.

==Plot synopsis==
A former Nazi SS dentist at Auschwitz, Dr. Christian Szell, now residing in Paraguay, has been living on the proceeds of diamonds he extorted from prisoners in the concentration camp. The diamonds are kept at a bank in New York City by his father. The sales and transfers of proceeds are facilitated by a secret US agency called The Division for whom Szell has provided information about other escaped Nazis. When his father dies in a car accident, Szell must come to New York himself to retrieve the diamonds, as there is no one else he can trust.

Meanwhile, at Columbia University, Thomas Babington &quot;Tom&quot; Levy, known by his brother as &quot;Babe&quot; (the first and middle names are a reference to Thomas Babington Macaulay, and the nickname is a reference to Babe Ruth) is a postgraduate student in history and an aspiring marathon runner. He is haunted by the suicide of his brilliant academic father, H. V. Levy, who was one of the victims of McCarthyism, when Babe was ten. Babe&#x27;s PhD dissertation aims to clear his father&#x27;s name of alleged Communist affiliations. Unbeknownst to Babe, his elder brother by ten years (and best friend), Henry David &quot;Hank&quot; Levy (after Henry David Thoreau), known by Babe as &quot;Doc&quot;, works in The Division under the name &quot;Scylla&quot; and has been helping to move Szell&#x27;s diamonds as part of his duties.

Szell arrives in New York City and meets with Doc. Suspecting Doc of planning to rob him when he retrieves the diamonds, Szell stabs him and leaves him for dead. Mortally wounded, Doc makes his way to Babe&#x27;s apartment and dies in his brother&#x27;s arms. When Szell learns this, he believes Doc may have told Babe about the plan to rob him. Szell&#x27;s two henchmen abduct Babe. Szell tortures Babe by drilling into his teeth without anesthetic and repeatedly asking the question, &quot;Is it safe?&quot;, referring to Szell&#x27;s appointment to collect his diamonds from the bank. Babe does not know what the question means nor the interrogator&#x27;s identity until Szell explains after torturing him.

When Szell finally concludes Babe knows nothing, he orders his people to dispose of the young man. Though in great pain, Babe escapes and, thanks to his training as a marathoner, outruns his pursuers.

Seeking revenge for the killing of Doc, Babe arranges a rendezvous at which Szell&#x27;s people, who hope to eliminate him, are killed instead. He then intercepts Szell at his bank, a confrontation that ultimately leads to Szell&#x27;s death.

==Background==
Goldman says he was inspired by the idea of bringing a major Nazi to the biggest Jewish city in the world. He wrote the book after the death of his beloved editor Hiram Haydn, who had edited all of his books from 1960 to 1974, and feels he never would have written something as commercial as &quot;Marathon Man&quot; had Haydn been alive.

Goldman later expressed dissatisfaction with the novel, but it went on to be his most successful book to that date.

==Development==
Goldman wrote the novel in 1973 while living on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. His concept began with the antagonist. Initially he wanted to write a story about Josef Mengele needing to travel to the United States for medical care, but he realized that he did not want to write a villain character who had frail health. After reading articles about Nazis stealing golden teeth from prisoners and accumulating wealth, Goldman created a villain who came to the United States to get his diamonds. He named the character after George Szell, a conductor. Goldman made Szell a dentist after considering memories of negative dental experiences as a child. Because Goldman was an American, he chose New York City as the setting of his work.

He decided to make the hero &quot;a total innocent&quot; who would be &quot;as virginal as [he] could&quot;. Goldman&#x27;s concept behind Babe was &quot;what if someone close to you was something totally different from what you thought?&quot; This refers to Babe&#x27;s relationship with Doc/Scylla. He wanted Babe to be weaker than Szell. Goldman created a weaker hero because &quot;If the worst guy in the world gets in the ring with the toughest guy in the world, that&#x27;s Stallone territory, and I can&#x27;t write that. I don&#x27;t mean I am pristine and above it all—obviously I could write it—anyone can write it—because anyone can write anything badly.&quot;

Goldman stated that once he had the basic concept behind the story, he was &quot;essentially mixing and matching, figuring out the surprises, hoping they would work&quot;. Goldman developed the idea of Babe having a toothache and Szell drilling into that tooth. When he discussed the scene with a periodontist, the periodontist told him that it would be more painful if the torturer drilled into a healthy tooth.

Goldman says he wrote at least two versions of the novel.

==Publication==
Evarts Ziegler, Goldman&#x27;s agent, later recalled &quot;going in we felt we had a home run in both fields, book and movie.&quot; They signed with Delacorte because Goldman wanted to control hard and soft cover rights. The deal amounted to $2 million for three books (&quot;Marathon Man&quot;, &quot;Magic&quot;, and &quot;Tinsel&quot;). The film rights to &quot;Marathon Man&quot; were sold for $450,000.

==Adaptations==
BBC Radio 4 aired a radio adaptation of the novel.

A film adaptation starring Dustin Hoffman as Babe, Roy Scheider as Doc and Laurence Olivier as Szell was released in 1976.

==Sequel==
The novel led to a sequel, &quot;Brothers&quot; (1986).

<text>The New World warblers or wood-warblers are a group of small, often colorful, passerine birds that make up the family Parulidae and are restricted to the New World. The family contains 120 species. They are not closely related to Old World warblers or Australian warblers. Most are arboreal, but some, like the ovenbird and the two waterthrushes, are primarily terrestrial. Most members of this family are insectivores.

This group likely originated in northern Central America, where the greatest number of species and diversity between them is found. From there, they spread north during the interglacial periods, mainly as migrants, returning to the ancestral region in winter. Two genera, &quot;Myioborus&quot; and &quot;Basileuterus&quot;, seem to have colonized South America early, perhaps before the two continents were linked, and together constitute most warbler species of that region.

The scientific name for the family, Parulidae, originates from the fact that Linnaeus in 1758 named the northern parula as a tit, &quot;Parus americanus&quot;, and as taxonomy developed, the genus name was modified first to &quot;Parulus&quot; and then to &quot;Parula&quot;. The family name derives from the name for the genus.

==Taxonomy==

The family Parulidae was introduced for the New World warblers in 1947 by American ornithologist Alexander Wetmore and collaborators with &quot;Parula&quot; as the type genus. &quot;Parula&quot; is now considered as a junior synonym of &quot;Setophaga&quot;.

The family was formerly thought to be sister to a clade containing the yellow-breasted chat in its own family Icteriidae, the wrenthrush in its own family Zeledoniidae, the two Cuban warblers in the family Teretistridae and the 109 species in the family Icteridae. However, more recent studies recover them as sister to a clade containing just the yellow-breasted chat and the Icteridae, with the clade containing all three families being sister to a clade containing the chat-tanagers in Calyptophilidae, the wrenthrush, and the Phaenicophilidae.

A molecular phylogenetic study of the Parulidae published in 2010 found that the species formed several major clades that did not align with the traditional genera. This led to a major reorganization of the species within the family to create monotypic genera. The changes have generally followed the recommendations of the authors of the study except in a few cases where the proposed genera were split to separate basal species from their proposed conspecifics.

A large clade that included the 29 species then placed in the genus &quot;Dendroica&quot;, also included four species of &quot;Parula&quot;, one of the three species of &quot;Wilsonia&quot; and the monotypic genera &quot;Catharopeza&quot; and &quot;Setophaga&quot;. All members of the clade apart from the basal &quot;Catharopeza&quot; were placed in the expanded genus &quot;Setophaga&quot; Swainson, 1827, which under the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, had priority over &quot;Dendroica&quot; Gray, 1842, &quot;Wilsonia&quot; Bonaparte, 1838, and &quot;Parula&quot; Bonaparte, 1838.

The species that had traditionally been placed in &quot;Basileuterus&quot; formed two clades. One group retains the genus name as it includes the golden-crowned warbler, the type species for the genus. The other larger group, now with 18 species, is placed in the resurrected genus &quot;Myiothlypis&quot; Cabanis, 1850, as it contains the type species, the black-crested warbler.

The genus &quot;Myioborus&quot; containing the whitestarts remained unchanged after the reorganization but six genera were no longer used: &quot;Dendroica&quot;, &quot;Ergaticus&quot;, &quot;Euthlypis&quot;, &quot;Parula&quot;, &quot;Wilsonia&quot; and &quot;Phaeothlypis&quot;.

===Extant Genera===
The family Parulidae now contains 120 species divided into 18 genera.
===Former species===
Some species that were previously placed in the Parulidae have been moved to other families:

* Olive warbler (&quot;Peucedramus taeniatus&quot;) – now in own family Peucedramidae
* Yellow-breasted chat (&quot;Icteria virens&quot;) – now in own family Icteriidae
* Three species in the genus &quot;Granatellus&quot; – now in the family Cardinalidae
** Red-breasted chat (&quot;Granatellus venustus&quot;)
** Grey-throated chat (&quot;Granatellus sallaei&quot;)
** Rose-breasted chat (&quot;Granatellus pelzelni&quot;)
* Wrenthrush (&quot;Zeledonia coronata&quot;) – now in own family Zeledoniidae
* Two species endemic to Hispaniola – now in family Phaenicophilidae
** Green-tailed warbler (&quot;Microligea palustris&quot;)
** White-winged warbler (&quot;Xenoligea montana&quot;) 
* Two species endemic to Cuba in the genus &quot;Teretistris&quot; – now in own family Teretistridae
**Yellow-headed warbler (&quot;Teretistris fernandinae&quot;)
**Oriente warbler (&quot;Teretistris fornsi&quot;)

==Description==
All the warblers are fairly small. The smallest species is Lucy&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Oreothlypis luciae&quot;), with a weight of around 6.5 g (0.23 oz) and an average length of . The &quot;Parkesia&quot; waterthrushes, the ovenbird, the russet-crowned warbler, and Semper&#x27;s warbler, all of which can exceed and 21 g (0.74 oz), may be considered the largest.

The migratory species tend to lay larger clutches of eggs, typically up to six, since the hazards of their journeys mean that many individuals will have only one chance to breed. In contrast, the laying of two eggs is typical for many tropical species, since the chicks can be provided with better care, and the adults are likely to have further opportunities for reproduction.

Many migratory species, particularly those which breed further north, have distinctive male plumage at least in the breeding season, since males need to reclaim territory and advertise for mates each year. This tendency is particularly marked in the large genus &quot;Setophaga&quot; (formerly &quot;Dendroica&quot;). In contrast, resident tropical species, which pair for life, show little if any sexual dimorphism, but exceptions occur. The &quot;Parkesia&quot; waterthrushes and ovenbird are strongly migratory, but have identical male and female plumage, whereas the mainly tropical and sedentary yellowthroats are dimorphic. The &quot;Granatellus&quot; chats also show sexual dimorphism, but due to recent genetic work, have been moved into the family Cardinalidae (New World buntings and cardinals).

The name warbler is a misnomer for the New World group of warblers established before the family was split from the Old World warbler in the 1830s. &quot;The Random House Dictionary&quot; defines &quot;to warble&quot; as &quot;to sing with trills.&quot; Most New World warblers do not warble, but rather &quot;lisp, buzz, hiss, chip, rollick, or zip.&quot;

<doc id="208183" wikidata="Q1428157" url="?curid=208183" title="Lucky number">
<text>In number theory, a lucky number is a natural number in a set which is generated by a certain &quot;sieve&quot;. This sieve is similar to the sieve of Eratosthenes that generates the primes, but it eliminates numbers based on their position in the remaining set, instead of their value (or position in the initial set of natural numbers).

The term was introduced in 1956 in a paper by Gardiner, Lazarus, Metropolis and Ulam. In the same work they also suggested calling another sieve, &quot;the sieve of Josephus Flavius&quot; because of its similarity with the counting-out game in the Josephus problem.

Lucky numbers share some properties with primes, such as asymptotic behaviour according to the prime number theorem; also, a version of Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture has been extended to them. There are infinitely many lucky numbers. Twin lucky numbers and twin primes also appear to occur with similar frequency. However, if &quot;L&quot;&quot;n&quot; denotes the &quot;n&quot;-th lucky number, and &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; the &quot;n&quot;-th prime, then &quot;L&quot;&quot;n&quot; &gt; &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; for all sufficiently large &quot;n&quot;.

Because of their apparent similarities with the prime numbers, some mathematicians have suggested that some of their common properties may also be found in other sets of numbers generated by sieves of a certain unknown form, but there is little theoretical basis for this conjecture. 

==The sieving process==
Continue removing the &quot;n&quot;th remaining numbers, where &quot;n&quot; is the next number in the list after the last surviving number. Next in this example is 9.

One way that the application of the procedure differs from that of the Sieve of Eratosthenes is that for &quot;n&quot; being the number being multiplied on a specific pass, the first number eliminated on the pass is the &quot;n&quot;-th remaining number that has not yet been eliminated, as opposed to the number &quot;2n&quot;. That is to say, the list of numbers this sieve counts through is different on each pass (for example 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19... on the third pass), whereas in the Sieve of Eratosthenes, the sieve always counts through the entire original list (1, 2, 3...).

When this procedure has been carried out completely, the remaining integers are the lucky numbers (those that happen to be prime are in bold):

: 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 21, 25, 31, 33, 37, 43, 49, 51, 63, 67, 69, 73, 75, 79, 87, 93, 99, 105, 111, 115, 127, 129, 133, 135, 141, 151, 159, 163, 169, 171, 189, 193, 195, 201, 205, 211, 219, 223, 231, 235, 237, 241, 259, 261, 267, 273, 283, 285, 289, 297, 303, 307, 319, 321, 327, 331, 339, ... .

The lucky number which removes &quot;n&quot; from the list of lucky numbers is: (0 if &quot;n&quot; is a lucky number)
:0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 2, 7, 2, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 2, 9, 2, 3, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 2, 7, 2, 3, 2, 0, 2, 13, 2, 3, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 2, 15, 2, 9, 2, 3, 2, 7, 2, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 2, 7, 2, 3, 2, 21, 2, ... 

==Lucky primes==
A &quot;lucky prime&quot; is a lucky number that is prime. They are:
:3, 7, 13, 31, 37, 43, 67, 73, 79, 127, 151, 163, 193, 211, 223, 241, 283, 307, 331, 349, 367, 409, 421, 433, 463, 487, 541, 577, 601, 613, 619, 631, 643, 673, 727, 739, 769, 787, 823, 883, 937, 991, 997, ... .
It has been conjectured that there are infinitely many lucky primes.

<doc id="208186" wikidata="Q15040" url="?curid=208186" title="Dione (moon)">
<text>Dione (), also designated Saturn IV, is the fourth-largest moon of Saturn. With a mean diameter of 1,123 km and a density of about 1.48 g/cm3, Dione is composed of an icy mantle and crust overlying a silicate rocky core, with rock and water ice roughly equal in mass. Its trailing hemisphere is marked by large cliffs and scarps called chasmata; the trailing hemisphere is also significantly darker compared to the leading hemisphere.

The moon was discovered by Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1684 and is named after the Titaness Dione in Greek mythology. Dione was first imaged up-close by the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; space probe in 1980. Later, the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft made multiple flybys of Dione throughout the 2000s and 2010s as part of its campaign to explore the Saturn system.

== Name ==
Giovanni Domenico Cassini named the four moons he discovered (Tethys, Dione, Rhea, and Iapetus) &quot;Sidera Lodoicea&quot; (&quot;the stars of Louis&quot;) to honor king Louis XIV. Cassini found Dione in 1684 using a large aerial telescope he set up on the grounds of the Paris Observatory. The satellites of Saturn were not named until 1847, when William Herschel&#x27;s son John Herschel published &quot;Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope,&quot; suggesting that the names of the Titans (sisters and brothers of Cronus) be used.

== Orbit ==

Dione orbits Saturn with a semimajor axis about 2% less than that of the Moon. However, reflecting Saturn&#x27;s greater mass (95 times that of Earth), Dione&#x27;s orbital period is one tenth that of the Moon. Dione is currently in a 1:2 mean-motion orbital resonance with moon Enceladus, completing one orbit of Saturn for every two orbits completed by Enceladus. This resonance maintains Enceladus&#x27;s orbital eccentricity (0.0047), providing a source of heat for Enceladus&#x27;s extensive geological activity, which shows up most dramatically in its cryovolcanic geyser-like jets. The resonance also maintains a smaller eccentricity in Dione&#x27;s orbit (0.0022), tidally heating it as well.
=== Trojans ===
Dione has two co-orbital, or trojan, moons, Helene and Polydeuces. They are located within Dione&#x27;s Lagrangian points and , 60 degrees ahead of and behind Dione respectively. A leading co-orbital moon twelve degrees ahead of Helene was reported by Stephen P. Synnott in 1982.

== Physical characteristics and interior ==
At in diameter, Dione is the 15th largest moon in the Solar System, and is more massive than all known moons smaller than itself combined. It is also Saturn&#x27;s fourth-largest moon. Based on its density, Dione’s interior is likely a combination of silicate rock and water ice in nearly equal parts by mass.

Shape and gravity observations collected by &quot;Cassini&quot; suggest a roughly 400 km radius rocky core surrounded by a roughly 160 km envelope of H2O, mainly in the form of water ice, but with some models suggesting that the lowermost part of this layer could be in the form of an internal liquid salt water ocean (a situation similar to that of its orbital resonance partner, Enceladus). Downward bending of the surface associated with the 1.5 km high ridge Janiculum Dorsa can most easily be explained by the presence of such an ocean. Neither moon has a shape close to hydrostatic equilibrium; the deviations are maintained by isostasy. Dione&#x27;s ice shell is thought to vary in thickness by less than 5%, with the thinnest areas at the poles, where tidal heating of the crust is greatest.

Though somewhat smaller and denser, Dione is otherwise very similar to Rhea. They both have similar albedo features and varied terrain, and both have dissimilar leading and trailing hemispheres. Dione&#x27;s leading hemisphere is heavily cratered and is uniformly bright. Its trailing hemisphere, however, contains an unusual and distinctive surface feature: a network of bright ice cliffs.
Scientists recognise Dionean geological features of the following types:
* Chasmata (chasms; long, deep, steep-sided depressions or canyons)
* Dorsa (ridges)
* Fossae (long narrow depressions)
* Craters
* Catenae (crater chains)

=== Ice cliffs (formerly &#x27;wispy terrain&#x27;) ===

When the &quot;Voyager&quot; space probe photographed Dione in 1980, it showed what appeared to be wispy features covering its trailing hemisphere. The origin of these features was mysterious, because all that was known was that the material has a high albedo and is thin enough that it does not obscure the surface features underneath. One hypothesis was that shortly after its formation Dione was geologically active, and some process such as cryovolcanism resurfaced much of its surface, with the streaks forming from eruptions along cracks in the Dionean surface that fell back as snow or ash. Later, after the internal activity and resurfacing ceased, cratering continued primarily on the leading hemisphere and wiped out the streak patterns there.

This hypothesis was proven wrong by the &quot;Cassini&quot; probe flyby of 13 December 2004, which produced close-up images. These revealed that the &#x27;wisps&#x27; were, in fact, not ice deposits at all, but rather bright ice cliffs created by tectonic fractures (chasmata). Dione has been revealed as a world riven by enormous fractures on its trailing hemisphere.

The &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter performed a closer flyby of Dione at on 11 October 2005, and captured oblique images of the cliffs, showing that some of them are several hundred metres high.

=== Linear features ===
Dione features linear &#x27;virgae&#x27; that are up to hundreds of km long but less than 5 km wide. These lines run parallel to the equator and are only apparent at lower latitudes (at less than 45° north or south); similar features are noted on Rhea. They are brighter than everything around them and appear to overlay other features such as ridges and craters, indicating they are relatively young. It has been proposed that these lines are of exogenic origin, as the result of the emplacement of material across the surface by low‐velocity impacts of material sourced from Saturn&#x27;s rings, co‐orbital moons, or closely approaching comets.

=== Craters ===

Dione&#x27;s icy surface includes heavily cratered terrain, moderately cratered plains, lightly cratered plains, and areas of tectonic fractures. The heavily cratered terrain has numerous craters greater than in diameter. The plains areas tend to have craters less than in diameter. Some of the plains are more heavily cratered than others. Much of the heavily cratered terrain is located on the trailing hemisphere, with the less cratered plains areas present on the leading hemisphere. This is the opposite of what some scientists expected; Shoemaker and Wolfe proposed a cratering model for a tidally locked satellite with the highest cratering rates on the leading hemisphere and the lowest on the trailing hemisphere. This suggests that during the period of heavy bombardment, Dione was tidally locked to Saturn in the opposite orientation. Because Dione is relatively small, an impact causing a 35 kilometer crater could have spun the satellite. Because there are many craters larger than , Dione could have been repeatedly spun during its early heavy bombardment. The pattern of cratering since then and the bright albedo of the leading side suggests that Dione has remained in its current orientation for several billion years.

Like Callisto, Dione&#x27;s craters lack the high-relief features seen on the Moon and Mercury; this is probably due to slumping of the weak icy crust over geologic time.

== Atmosphere ==
On 7 April 2010, instruments on board the uncrewed &quot;Cassini&quot; probe, which flew by Dione, detected a thin layer of molecular oxygen ions () around Dione, so thin that scientists prefer to call it an exosphere rather than a tenuous atmosphere. The density of molecular oxygen ions determined from the &quot;Cassini&quot; plasma spectrometer data ranges from 0.01 to 0.09 per cm3.

The &quot;Cassini&quot; probe instruments were unable to directly detect water from the exosphere due to high background levels, but it seems that highly charged particles from the planet&#x27;s powerful radiation belts could split the water in the ice into hydrogen and oxygen.

== Exploration ==

Dione was first imaged by the &quot;Voyager&quot; space probes. It has also been probed five times from close distances by the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter. There was a close targeted flyby at a distance of on 11 October 2005; another flyby was performed on 7 April 2010, also at a distance of 500 km. A third flyby was performed on 12 December 2011 at a distance of . The following flyby was on 16 June 2015 at a distance of , and the last &quot;Cassini&quot; flyby was performed on 17 August 2015 at a distance of .

In May 2013, it was announced that NASA&#x27;s spacecraft &quot;Cassini&quot; had provided scientists with evidence that Dione is more active than previously realized. Using topographic data, NASA teams deduced that crustal depression associated with a prominent mountain ridge on the leading hemisphere is best explained if there was a global subsurface liquid ocean like that of Enceladus. The ridge Janiculum Dorsa has a height of 1 to 2 km (0.6 to 1.2 miles); Dione&#x27;s crust seems to pucker 0.5 km (0.3 miles) under it, suggesting that the icy crust was warm when the ridge formed, probably due to the presence of a subsurface liquid ocean, which increases tidal flexing.

<text>Jan Blažej Santini Aichel, also spelled Aichl (, ; 3 February 1677 – 7 December 1723) was a Czech architect of Italian descent, whose major works are representative of the unique Baroque Gothic style.

==Biography==
He was born on the day of Saint Blaise as the oldest son to a respectable family of Prague stonemasons (his grandfather Antonio Aichel moved from Cadempino to Prague in the 1630s) and was baptized in the St. Vitus Cathedral as Johann Blasius Aichel. He was born with extensive physical disabilities, preventing him from following in his father&#x27;s footsteps. He studied painting under the Bohemian Court painter Christian Schröder.

Around 1696 he started to travel and gain experience. After his journey through Austria he arrived in Rome, where he had the possibility to meet with the work of Francesco Borromini. Borromini&#x27;s influence is apparent in his predilection for star-shaped forms and complex symbolism. It was in Italy where Santini Aichel incorporated into his name his father&#x27;s name, Santini.

Santini Aichel founded his architectural practice in Prague in 1703, attaining the status of a Burgher of Prague in 1705. He bought and rebuilt the Valkounsky House in the same year. Santini married Schröder&#x27;s daughter, Veronica Elisabeth, in 1707. They had four children, but all three sons died from tuberculosis at an early age; the only child left was Anna Veronika (born 1713). Santini&#x27;s wife died seven years later and he remarried a South Bohemian noblewoman, Antonia Ignatia Chrapická of Mohliškovice, whereby Santini was ennobled. Daughter Jana Ludmila and son Jan Ignác Rochus were born from this marriage.

Santini Aichel died at 46, having built over 100 buildings in his twenty-year career, but leaving some unfinished. Although he had become a well-regarded architect to Bohemia&#x27;s greatest noble families and monastic orders, his original, eclectic style had few successors or imitators.

The asteroid 37699 Santini-Aichl is named in his honour.

<text>In the United States and Canada, bingo is a game of chance in which each player matches the numbers printed in different arrangements on cards. The game host (known as a &quot;caller&quot;) draws balls at random, marking the selected numbers with tiles. When a player finds that the selected numbers are arranged on their card in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, they call out &quot;Bingo!&quot; to alert all participants to a winning card, which prompts the game host (or an associate assisting the host) to examine the card for verification of the win. Players compete against one another to be the first to have a winning arrangement for the prize or jackpot. After a winner is declared, the players clear their number cards of the tiles and the game host begins a new round of play.

Alternative methods of play try to increase participation by creating excitement. Since its invention in 1929, modern bingo has evolved into multiple variations, with each jurisdiction&#x27;s gambling laws regulating how the game is played. There are also nearly unlimited patterns that may be specified for play. Some games require only one number to be matched, while cover-all games award the jackpot for covering an entire card. There are even games that award prizes to players for matching no numbers or achieving no pattern.

==History==
A game of chance named lotto was being played in Italy by about 1530. In the 18th century, a home version (called Tombola) was created in Naples with the addition of cards, tokens, and the calling out of numbers. In the nineteenth century, a game like this was widely played in Germany to teach children spelling, animal names, and the multiplication table.

The French game &quot;Le Lotto&quot; appeared in 1778, featuring 27 squares in a layout of three rows and nine columns. Five squares in each row had numbers ranging from 1 through 90, which led to the modern design.

In the early 1920s, Hugh J. Ward created and standardized the game at carnivals in and around Pittsburgh and the Western Pennsylvania area. He copyrighted it and published a rule book in 1933.

The game was further popularized by Edwin S. Lowe. While at a traveling carnival near Atlanta in December 1929, the toy merchandiser saw people eagerly playing a game called &quot;Beano&quot;, following Ward&#x27;s rules, with dried beans, a rubber stamp, and cardboard sheets. Lowe took the game to New York, where friends liked playing it. The Lowe-produced bingo game had two versions: a 12-card set for $1.00 and a $2.00 set with 24 cards. By the 1940s, there were bingo games throughout the US.

The origin of the name &quot;Bingo&quot; is unknown but may date to the mid-1920s. There are claims that one of Lowe&#x27;s friends was so excited to have won that she yelled out &quot;Bingo&quot; instead of &quot;Beano&quot;, or that the word echoes the sound of a bell.

==Cards==

The most common bingo cards are flat pieces of cardboard or disposable paper that contain 25 squares arranged in five vertical columns and five side-to-side rows. Each space in the grid contains a number, except the middle square, which is designated a &quot;free&quot; space.

A typical bingo game utilizes the numbers 1 through 75. The five columns of the card are labeled &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;N&#x27;, &#x27;G&#x27;, and &#x27;O&#x27; from left to right. The center space is usually marked &quot;free&quot; or &quot;free space&quot;, and is considered automatically filled. The range of printed numbers that can appear on the card is normally restricted by column, with the &#x27;B&#x27; column only containing numbers between 1 and 15 inclusive, the &#x27;I&#x27; column containing only 16 through 30, &#x27;N&#x27; containing 31 through 45, &#x27;G&#x27; containing 46 through 60, and &#x27;O&#x27; containing 61 through 75.

The number of all possible bingo cards with these standard features is = 552,446,474,061,128,648,601,600,000 or approximately . The way the numbers are being assigned to each column makes a horizontal line win about three times more probable than a vertical line win when many people play together.

In u-pick &#x27;em bingo and other variants of bingo, players are issued three 25-number cards that contain all 75 numbers that may be drawn. Players then mark which numbers they wish to play and then daub those numbers according to the numbers drawn. In addition, double-action cards have two numbers in each square.

A player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal. The most chips one can place on a bingo board without having a bingo is 19, not counting the free space. (For this to happen, two spots in opposite corners must not be filled along with a spot on one corner of the center away from the two opposite corner spots and finally opposite to that in relation to the center would be two flat against the center piece.)

In addition to a straight line, other patterns may be considered a valid bingo in special games. For example, a 2×2 square of marked squares in the upper-right-hand corner could be considered a &quot;postage stamp&quot;. Another commonly valid pattern is covering the four corners. Certain special games only count specific patterns as bingos, such as a roving &#x27;L&#x27;, which requires players to cover all B&#x27;s and the top or bottom row or all O&#x27;s and the top or bottom row, or a blackout, covering all 24 numbers and the free space.

==Equipment==
The numbers that are called in a game of bingo may be drawn utilizing a variety of methods to randomly generate the ball call. With the expansion of computer technology in bingo, electronic random number generators (RNG) are now commonplace in most jurisdictions. Some require mechanical ball draws which may utilize a randomly shuffled deck of bingo calling cards, a mechanical ball blower that mixes ping pong balls with blown air, or a cage that is turned to mix small wooden balls. All methods essentially generate a random string of numbers that players match to the bingo cards that have numbers on them.

==Culture==
Single games often have multiple bingos; for example, the players first play for a single line; after that, play goes on until a full card is called; then, play continues for a consolation full card.

Players often play multiple cards for each game. Because of the large number of cards played by each player, most halls have the players sit at tables to which they often fasten their cards with adhesive tape. To mark cards faster the players usually use special markers called &quot;daubers&quot;. At commercial halls, after calling the number the caller then displays the next number on a television monitor; bingo cannot be called until that number is called aloud.

Bingo is often used as an instructional tool in American schools and in teaching English as a foreign language in many countries. Typically, the numbers are replaced with beginning reader words, pictures, or unsolved math problems. Custom bingo creation programs now allow teachers and parents to create bingo cards using their own content.

===Terminology===
; Ready/waiting/cased/set/down/pat/open; has a shot/chance
:Describes a player who only needs one number in order to complete the bingo pattern.
; Breaking the bubble or &quot;possible&quot; 
:The bubble is the minimum number of balls required to complete the bingo pattern. This is the earliest point any player could have a valid bingo. For standard bingo games, at least one number in each column or four/five numbers in a single column need to be called for a bingo to be possible.
; Jumping the gun/premature bingo/social error/bongo
:One who calls bingo before having a valid bingo. The most common situation is someone calling bingo using the next number in the screen before it has been called.
:; False alarm or just practicing
::A tongue-in-cheek term used when one calls bingo but is mistaken. This could be because of mishearing the caller or stamping the wrong number by mistake. Someone who calls a &quot;falsie&quot; genuinely believes that they have a bingo.
; Wild numbers 
:Many bingo halls will have certain games with a wild number. Wild numbers allow bingo players to start with multiple called numbers. Typically, the first ball drawn is the determining factor.
:;Standard 
::All numbers ending with the second digit of the first number. Example: First ball is 22. All numbers ending in a 2 including B2 is considered a called number.
:;Forwards/backwards
::All numbers beginning or ending with the wild number. Example: First ball is 22. All numbers beginning or ending with a 2 is considered a called number. If the first number ends with an 8, 9, or 0, another number may be drawn as there are no numbers starting with an 8 or 9 and only 9 numbers starting with a 0. Some halls will also redraw a number ending with a 7 as there are only six numbers beginning with a 7.
; Hard-way bingo
:A bingo pattern in a straight line without the use of the free space.
; Reach
: In Japan, a player will yell &quot;Reach&quot; when they are one space away from a bingo.

==Business==
In the United States, bingo games are commonly organized by churches or charity organizations, with their legality and stakes varying by state regulation. Bingo halls in some states are rented out to sponsoring organizations, and these halls often host games almost daily. Church-run games, on the other hand, are typically weekly events held on church premises. These games are usually played for modest stakes, although the final game of a session often features a coverall game with a larger jackpot prize for winning within a certain quantity of numbers called. A progressive jackpot is one that may increase per session until it is won.

Commercial bingo games in the US are primarily offered by casinos (only in the state of Nevada) and Native American bingo halls, which are often located in the same venue as Native American-run casinos. In Nevada, bingo is mainly offered by casinos catering to local gamblers, rather than the famous tourist resorts. They typically offer one-hour sessions on the odd hours, such as 9 am, 11 am, and 1 pm daily, usually from 9 am to 11 pm, with relatively modest stakes except for coverall jackpots. Most bingo parlors in Las Vegas use handheld machines for the games. 

Native American games usually offer only one or two sessions a day and are often played for higher stakes than charity games to attract players from distant places. Some also offer a special progressive jackpot game that may link players from multiple bingo halls.

In both Canada and the United States, some gay bars and other LGBT-oriented organizations host bingo events, often combined with a drag show and marketed as &quot;Drag Bingo&quot; or &quot;Drag Queen Bingo&quot;. &quot;Drag Bingo&quot; events originated in Seattle in the early 1990s as a fundraiser for local HIV/AIDS charities. They have since expanded to many other cities across North America, supporting a diverse range of charities.

Cheektowaga, New York, with one bingo hall for every 6,800 residents, is believed to have the highest concentration of bingo halls in the United States. The suburb of Buffalo&#x27;s large Polish-American Catholic population is thought to be a factor in bingo&#x27;s significant popularity in Western New York, which has five times as many bingo halls per capita as the rest of the state.

==Electronic==
The advent of computer technology in bingo has blurred the lines between traditional slot machines and bingo slot machines. To the average person, bingo-based slot machines are physically indistinguishable from an RNG based slot machine typically seen in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. These devices are commonly called Class II machines, because the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act separated bingo, including electronic and mechanical aids, where players play against each other, from Class III slot machines, where players play against the house.

As a result of the passage of SB1180 in 2017, the State of Arizona now allows technological aids for bingo games that function only as an electronic substitute for bingo cards. These technological aids are not defined by Arizona law or regulation, but one such electronic technological aid consists of a system which includes a network linking player interfaces to a number drawing device (ball-draw server) and an electronic substitute for a &quot;live&quot; cashier. The player interfaces themselves do not contain random number generators or allow a player to directly deposit cash. Rather, the Arizona technological aid system allows a player to deposit money into a unique individual player&#x27;s account, pay for the games played out of that account, and at the end of play redeposit the value of any unused games that the player may have purchased or won back into that account. The system does not allow the player to print a redemption ticket or receive anything of value directly from the player interface.

Music bingo is growing in popularity and is finding its way into bars, pubs, and other events as bingo is already a familiar concept and when integrated with music, also results in fun and collaboration among players (singing along to the songs that are randomly played). It was introduced as a game show in 1958 and continues to expand today.

==Game shows==

* Slingo, an online game that blends slots and bingo
* &quot;Pinoy Bingo Night&quot;, a game show in the Philippines with Kris Aquino on ABS-CBN.

<doc id="208200" wikidata="Q36105" url="?curid=208200" title="Charles Bronson">
<text>Charles Bronson (born Charles Dennis Buchinsky; November 3, 1921 – August 30, 2003) was an American actor. He was known for his roles in action films and his &quot;granite features and brawny physique&quot;. Bronson was born into extreme poverty in Ehrenfeld, Pennsylvania, a coal mining town in the Allegheny Mountains. Bronson&#x27;s father, a miner, died when Bronson was young. Bronson himself worked in the mines as well until joining the United States Army Air Forces in 1943 to fight in World War II. After his service, he joined a theatrical troupe and studied acting. During the 1950s, he played various supporting roles in motion pictures and television, including anthology drama TV series in which he would appear as the main character. Near the end of the decade, he had his first cinematic leading role in &quot;Machine-Gun Kelly&quot; (1958).

Bronson had sizeable co-starring roles in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960), &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963), &quot;This Property Is Condemned&quot; (1966), and &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967). Bronson also performed in many major television shows, and was nominated for an Emmy Award for his supporting role in an episode of &quot;General Electric Theater.&quot; Actor Alain Delon (who was a fan of Bronson) hired him to co-star with him in the French film &quot;Adieu l&#x27;ami&quot; (1968). That year, he also played one of the leads in the Italian spaghetti Western, &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (1968). Bronson continued playing leads in various action, Western, and war films made in Europe, including &quot;Rider on the Rain&quot; (1970), which won a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. During this time Bronson was the most popular American actor in Europe.

After this period, he returned to the United States to make more films, working with director Michael Winner. Their early collaborations included &quot;Chato&#x27;s Land&quot; (1972), &quot;The Mechanic&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Stone Killer&quot; (1973). At this point, he became the world&#x27;s top box-office star, commanding a salary of $1 million per film. In 1974, Bronson starred in the controversial film &quot;Death Wish&quot; (also directed by Winner), about an architect turned vigilante, a role that typified most of the characters he played for the rest of his career. Most critics initially panned the film as exploitative, but the movie was a major box-office success and spawned four sequels.

Until his retirement in the late 1990s, Bronson almost exclusively played lead roles in action-oriented films, such as &quot;Mr. Majestyk&quot; (1974), &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1975), &quot;St. Ives&quot; (1976), &quot;The White Buffalo&quot; (1977), &quot;Telefon&quot; (1977), and &quot;Assassination&quot; (1987). During this time he often collaborated with director J. Lee Thompson. He also made a number of non-action television films in which he acted against type. His last significant role in cinema was a supporting one in a dramatic film, &quot;The Indian Runner&quot; (1991); his performance in it was praised by reviewers.

==Early life and war service==
Bronson was born November 3, 1921, in Ehrenfeld, Pennsylvania, a coal mining region in the Allegheny Mountains, north of Johnstown. He was the 11th of 15 children born into a Roman Catholic family of Lithuanian descent. The very large family slept in shifts in their cold-water shack. The coal car tracks that ran out of the mine&#x27;s mouth passed just a few yards away. His father, Walter Buchinsky ( Vladislavas Valteris Paulius Bučinskas/Bučinskis), was a Lipka Tatar from Druskininkai in southern Lithuania. Bronson&#x27;s mother, Mary (née Valinsky), whose parents were from Lithuania, was born in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, in the Coal Region.

Bronson said English was not spoken at home during his childhood, like many other first-generation American children he grew up with. He once recounted that even as a soldier, his accent was strong enough to make his comrades think he was a foreigner. Besides English, he could speak Lithuanian and Russian.

In a 1973 interview, Bronson remarked that he did not know his father very well, and was not sure if he loved or hated him, adding that all he could remember about him was that whenever his mother announced that his father was coming home, the children would hide. In 1933, after his father died of cancer, Bronson went to work in the coal mines, first in the mining office and then in the mine. He later said he earned one dollar for each ton of coal that he mined. In another interview, he said that he had to work double shifts to earn $1 () a week. Bronson later recounted that he and his brother engaged in dangerous work removing &quot;stumps&quot; between the mines, and that cave-ins were common.

The family suffered extreme poverty during the Great Depression, and Bronson recalled going hungry many times. His mother could not afford milk for his younger sister, so she was fed warm tea instead. He said he had to wear his elder sister&#x27;s dress to school for lack of clothing. Bronson was the first member of his family to graduate from high school.

Bronson worked in the mines until enlisting in the United States Army Air Forces in 1943 during World War II. He served in the 760th Flexible Gunnery Training Squadron, and in 1945 as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress aerial gunner with the Guam-based 61st Bombardment Squadron within the 39th Bombardment Group, which conducted combat missions against the Japanese home islands. He flew 25 missions and received a Purple Heart for wounds received in battle.

==Career and education==
=== 1946 to 1951: acting training ===
After the end of World War II, Bronson did odd jobs until a theatrical group in Philadelphia hired him to paint scenery, which led to acting in minor roles. He later shared an apartment in New York City with Jack Klugman, who was an aspiring actor at the time. Eventually, he moved to Hollywood, where he enrolled in acting classes at the Pasadena Playhouse.

=== 1951 to 1958: early films to leading roles ===
In his early career, Bronson was still credited as Charles Buchinsky. His first film role – an uncredited one – was as a sailor in &quot;You&#x27;re in the Navy Now&quot; in 1951, directed by Henry Hathaway. Other screen appearances in 1951 were &quot;The Mob,&quot; and &quot;The People Against O&#x27;Hara&quot;, directed by John Sturges.

In 1952, he acted in &quot;Bloodhounds of Broadway&quot;; &quot;Battle Zone&quot;; &quot;Pat and Mike,&quot; &quot;Diplomatic Courier&quot; (1952), Henry Hathaway&#x27;s &quot;My Six Convicts,&quot; &quot;The Marrying Kind,&quot; and &quot;Red Skies of Montana&quot;.

That year on television, he boxed in a ring with Roy Rogers in Rogers&#x27; show &quot;Knockout&quot;. He appeared on an episode of &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; as a boxer in a skit with Skelton playing &quot;Cauliflower McPugg&quot;. He appeared with fellow guest star Lee Marvin in an episode of &quot;Biff Baker, U.S.A.&quot;, an espionage series on CBS.

In 1953, he played Igor the sidekick of Vincent Price in the horror film &quot;House of Wax&quot;, directed by Andre de Toth. To prepare his role as a mute he took a course in sign language. Ben S. Parker of &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; said &quot;Buchinsky adds mute menace as a deaf-and-dumb assistant to the madman&quot;. In the US, the film reach the 4th place on the highest box office of that year and made 23 millions. The Library of Congress selected &quot;House of Wax&quot; for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2014, deeming it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

That same year, he had roles in &quot;The Clown,&quot; and &quot;Off Limits&quot;&quot;.&quot;

In 1954, he appeared in &quot;Riding Shotgun&quot;, starring Randolph Scott, directed by de Toth. It was reported that he got the role due to the quality of his performance in &quot;House of Wax.&quot; That year on television, he acted in &quot;The case of the desperate men&quot; and episode of &quot;Treasury Men in Action&quot;.

Also that year, he acted in the film &quot;Apache&quot; for director Robert Aldrich, &quot;Tennessee Champ&quot;, &quot;Miss Sadie Thompson,&quot; &quot;Crime Wave&quot; directed by de Toth, &quot;Vera Cruz,&quot; and &quot;Drum Beat,&quot; directed by Delmer Daves.&quot;&quot; 

Also in 1954, during height of the Red Scare and the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) proceedings, he changed his surname from Buchinsky to Bronson at the suggestion of his agent, who feared that a Russian surname might damage his career.

In 1955, Bronson acted in &quot;Target Zero&quot;, &quot;Big House, U.S.A.&quot;, and &quot;Jubal.&quot; That year on television he played a lead in &quot;A Chain of Hearts&quot; an episode of the anthology drama series &quot;DuPont Cavalcade Theater&quot;.

In 1956 he acted in Sam Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Run of the Arrow&quot;. That year on television, he played Alexis St. Martin in &quot;Who search for truth&quot; an episode of &quot;Medic&quot;. Also that year he started acting in the television show &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and would return over the year: These episodes are &quot;And So Died Riabouchinska&quot; (Season 1 Episode 20 which aired 2/10/1956), &quot;There Was an Old Woman&quot; (1956), and &quot;The Woman Who Wanted to Live&quot; (1962).

In 1957, Bronson was cast in the Western series &quot;Colt .45&quot; as an outlaw named Danny Arnold in the episode &quot;Young Gun&quot;.

He appeared in five episodes of Richard Boone&#x27;s &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; (1957–63). He guest-starred in the short-lived CBS situation comedy, &quot;Hey, Jeannie!&quot;

In May 1958, Roger Corman&#x27;s biopic of a real life gangster &quot;Machine-Gun Kelly&quot; premiered, in it Bronson plays the lead. Geoffrey M. Warren of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; said Bronson makes Kelly &quot;a full, three dimensional human being&quot;.

In June 1958, &quot;Showdown at Boot Hill&quot; premiered, where he played the lead.

The following July &quot;Gang War&quot;, started its theatrical run. Bronson plays the lead as a Los Angeles high-school teacher, who witnesses a gangland killing and agrees to testify. Not realizing this will cause retaliation.On October 10, ABC&#x27;s series &quot;Man with a Camera&quot; premiered. Bronson played the lead in which he portrayed Mike Kovac, a freelance crime fighting photographer in New York City. The show lasted two season until 1960.

In November, &quot;When Hell Broke Loose&quot; premiered, where he played the lead&quot;.&quot;

In 1958 on television, Bronson appeared as Butch Cassidy on the television Western &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot; in the episode titled &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot;.

=== 1959 to 1968: supporting roles in major projects to European breakthrough ===
In 1959, Bronson had a supporting role in an expensive war film, &quot;Never So Few&quot;, directed by John Sturges.

In 1959, on television, he acted in the &quot;Yancy Derringer&quot; episode &quot;Hell and High Water&quot;, and in &quot;U.S. Marshal&quot;.

In 1960, in John Sturges&#x27;s &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, he played one of seven gunfighters taking up the cause of the defenseless. According to co-star Eli Wallach, during filming &quot;Bronson was a loner who kept to himself.&quot; He received $50,000 () for this role. The film was a domestic box-office disappointment, but it proved to be such a smash hit in Europe that it ultimately made a profit. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; praised the film as &quot;A superb Western, well-acted and crammed full of action, human interest, pathos, suspense, plus some romance and humor.&quot; In 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 1963, in John Sturges&#x27;s &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, Bronson was part of an ensemble cast who played World War II prisoners of war. The film received acclaim. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the critics consensus reads, &quot;With its impeccably slow-building story and a cast for the ages, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; is an all-time action classic.&quot; It grossed $11.7 million () at the box office on a budget of $4 million (). It became one of the highest-grossing films of 1963. It was nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globe Awards, and is 19th in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills.

Also that year he played a villain in Robert Aldrich&#x27;s &quot;4 for Texas&quot;.

On television that year, he co-starred in the series &quot;Empire,&quot; which lasted one season. Bronson acted in the 1963–64 television season of the ABC Western series &quot;The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters&quot;.

In 1966, Bronson played a central character in Sydney Pollack&#x27;s &quot;This Property Is Condemned&quot;, based on a Tennessee Williams&#x27;s play. Elston Brooks of the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; said &quot;Bronson has never been better as the embittered boarder&quot;.

Also that year, Bronson acted in Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;The Sandpiper.&quot;

In 1967, in Robert Aldrich&#x27;s &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;, Bronson was part of an ensemble cast who played GI-prisoners trained for a suicide mission. &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; was a massive commercial success. In its first five days in New York, the film grossed $103,849 from 2 theatres. Produced on a budget of $5.4 million, it earned theatrical rentals of $7.5 million in its first five weeks from 1,152 bookings and 625 prints, one of the fastest-grossing films at the time. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the critics consensus reads, &quot;Amoral on the surface and exuding testosterone, &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; utilizes combat and its staggering cast of likeable scoundrels to deliver raucous entertainment.&quot; It is 65th in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills.

That year on television, he guest-starred as Ralph Schuyler, an undercover government agent in the episode &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Fugitive&quot;.

In 1968, Bronson made a serious name for himself in European films. He was making &quot;Villa Rides&quot; when approached by the producers of Jean Herman&#x27;s French film &quot;Adieu l&#x27;ami&quot; looking for an American co-star for Alain Delon, a fan of Bronson&#x27;s acting. Bronson&#x27;s agent Paul Kohner later recalled the producer pitched the actor &quot;on the fact that in the American film industry all the money, all the publicity, goes to the pretty boy hero types. In Europe... the public is attracted by character, not face.&quot; Bronson was signed in December 1967. The film was shot in Marseilles and Paris. The film was a massive hit in France, earning around $6 million at the box office. Bronson went on to star in a series of European made movies that were hugely popular. The &quot;TV Guide&quot; praised the chemistry between Delon and Bronson.

Another European success, was Sergio Leone&#x27;s Spaghetti Western &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; where played one of the leads. Bronson had turned down Leone prior to this film for the lead in 1964&#x27;s &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;. In Italy, the film sold 8,870,732 tickets. In the United States, it grossed $5,321,508, from ticket sales. It sold a further 14,873,804 admissions in France and 13,018,414 admissions in Germany. The film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film is regarded as one of the greatest Westerns of all time and one of the greatest films of all time. Leone called Bronson &quot;the greatest actor I ever worked with&quot;.

Also that year, Bronson acted in Henri Verneuil&#x27;s &quot;Guns for San Sebastian,&quot; and Buzz Kulik&#x27;s &quot;Villa Rides.&quot; He was also set to star in &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; (1972), but did not work on the project.

=== 1969 to 1973: subsequent success to US breakthrough ===
In 1969, he was being considered to co-star in &quot;99 and 44/100% Dead&quot; (1974), while early drafts of the script were being made.

In 1970, Bronson played lead roles in Richard Donner&#x27;s &quot;Lola&quot;, Peter Collinson&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Win &#x27;Em All,&quot; Sergio Sollima&#x27;s &quot;Violent City,&quot; and Terence Young&#x27;s &quot;Cold Sweat.&quot;

Also in 1970, Bronson played a lead in René Clément&#x27;s French thriller, &quot;Rider on the Rain.&quot; It was a hit in France as well as the United States and solidified Bronson&#x27;s rise to international stardom. Wanda Hale of the &quot;Daily News&quot; gave it four stars and said Bronson is &quot;marvelous as the tough American colonel&quot;. It won a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

In June 1970, it was announced that he was being considered to star in &quot;Papillon&quot; (1973), the role that went to Steve McQueen.

In 1971, he acted in Nicolas Gessner&#x27;s French thriller, &quot;Someone Behind the Door,&quot; alongside Anthony Perkins. Also that year, he acted in Terence Young&#x27;s French-Spanish-Italian Western, &quot;Red Sun&quot;.

In 1972, &quot;The Valachi Papers&quot; was directed by Terence Young; Bronson played Joseph Valachi.

That year, this overseas fame earned him a special Golden Globe Henrietta Award for &quot;World Film Favorite – Male&quot; together with Sean Connery.

In 1972, Bronson began a string of successful action films for United Artists, beginning with Michael Winner&#x27;s &quot;Chato&#x27;s Land&quot;. This would lead Winner and Bronson to work on multiple films together following up with &quot;The Mechanic&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Stone Killer&quot; (1973).

By 1973, Bronson was considered to be the world&#x27;s top box office attraction, and commanded $1 million per film.

In 1973, Bronson worked with director John Sturges on &quot;Chino.&quot; Also Warner Bros. were trying to convince director Robert Aldrich to have Bronson play the lead in &quot;The Yakuza&quot;. The role went to Robert Mitchum.

In 1974, Bronson&#x27;s most famous role came at age 52, in &quot;Death Wish&quot;, his most popular film, with director Michael Winner. He played Paul Kersey, a successful New York architect who turns into a crime-fighting vigilante after his wife is murdered and his daughter sexually assaulted. This movie spawned four sequels over the next two decades, all starring Bronson. Many critics were displeased with the film, considering it an &quot;immoral threat to society&quot; and an encouragement of antisocial behavior. The film was the 20th highest-grossing film in the US that year making 22 millions at the box office.

Also that year, he played the lead in &quot;Mr. Majestyk&quot; directed by Richard Fleischer based on a book by Elmore Leonard.

=== 1975 to 1989: action film star ===

In 1975, Bronson starred in two films directed by Tom Gries: &quot;Breakout&quot;, a box office bonanza which grossed $21 million on a $4.6 million budget, and &quot;Breakheart Pass&quot;, a Western adapted from a novel by Alistair MacLean, which was a box office disappointment.

In 1975, he starred in the directorial debut of Walter Hill, &quot;Hard Times&quot;, playing a Depression-era street fighter making his living in illegal bare-knuckled matches in Louisiana. It earned good reviews. The film was the 29th highest-grossing film in the US that year making 5 millions at the box office. Roger Ebert said it is &quot;a powerful, brutal film containing a definitive Charles Bronson performance.&quot;

In 1975, he was one of many actors who were offered the lead in &quot;The Shootist&quot; (1976). All turned it down because the character had prostate cancer.

Bronson reached his pinnacle in box-office drawing power in 1975, when he was ranked 4th, behind only Robert Redford, Barbra Streisand, and Al Pacino.

In 1976, Bronson did a Western comedy for UA, Frank D. Gilroy&#x27;s &quot;From Noon till Three&quot;. Also that year, Bronson made &quot;St. Ives&quot;, his first film with director J. Lee Thompson.

In 1977, Bronson acted in Irvin Kershner&#x27;s &quot;Raid on Entebbe,&quot; where he played Dan Shomron. The NBC television film was based on the true story of the Entebbe raid. It received initially good reviews. Capitalizing on its strong all-star ensemble cast, a film version was released theatrically in the UK and Europe in early 1977. At the Golden Globe Awards it won &quot;Best Television Movie&quot;. At the Emmy Awards it was nominated for &quot;Outstanding Special – Drama or Comedy&quot; as well as winning and receiving nominations in other categories. Also that year, he was reunited with Thompson in &quot;The White Buffalo&quot;, produced by Dino de Laurentiis for UA. UA also released &quot;Telefon&quot;, directed by Don Siegel. Finally in 1977, Bronson was announced as the star of &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; (1980), but didn&#x27;t appear in the final product.

In the 1970s, director Ingmar Bergman wanted to make a film with Bronson but he turned him down finding Bergman&#x27;s works dull. &quot;Everything is weakness and sickness with Bergman,&quot; he said. Bronson auditioned for the role of Superman for the 1978 film adaptation, but producer Ilya Salkind turned him down for being too earthy and decided to cast Christopher Reeve. Another 1978 film he was considered as a lead was &quot;Capricorn One&quot;. For the 1981 film &quot;Escape from New York,&quot; the studio wanted him to play the role of Snake Plissken, but director John Carpenter thought he was too tough-looking and too old for the part, and he decided to cast Kurt Russell instead.

Bronson went on to make two films for ITC, &quot;Love and Bullets&quot; (1979) and &quot;Borderline&quot; (1980). He was reunited with Thompson on &quot;Caboblanco&quot; (1980).

In 1981, Bronson co-lead with Lee Marvin in Peter Hunt&#x27;s adventure film &quot;Death Hunt&quot;. It is a fictionalized account of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) pursuit of a man named Albert Johnson, played by Bronson. In Vincent Canby&#x27;s review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he recognized that two old pros were at work. &quot;Mr. Bronson and Mr. Marvin are such old hands at this sort of movie that each can create a character with ease, out of thin, cold air.&quot; The film grossed $5,000,000 at the US box-office.

Between 1976 and 1994, Bronson commanded high salaries to star in numerous films made by smaller production companies, most notably Cannon Films, for whom some of his last films were made.

Bronson was paid $1.5 million () by Cannon to star in &quot;Death Wish II&quot; (1982), directed by Michael Winner. In the story, architect Paul Kersey (Bronson) moves to Los Angeles with his daughter. After she is murdered at the hands of several gang members, Kersey once again becomes a vigilante. Cannon Films promptly hired Bronson for &quot;10 to Midnight&quot; (1983), in which he played a cop chasing a serial killer. The film marks the fourth collaboration between Bronson and director J. Lee Thompson.

ITC Entertainment hired Thompson and Bronson for &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot; (1984). Cannon Films reunited Bronson and Winner for &quot;Death Wish 3&quot; (1985). In &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot; (1986), directed by Thompson, Bronson plays Jack Murphy, a hardened, antisocial LAPD detective who turns to alcohol to numb the pain of harsh reality.

In 1986, he starred in John Mackenzie&#x27;s &quot;Act of Vengeance.&quot; Based on a true story, he plays union leader Joseph Yablonski going against W.A. Boyle (Wilford Brimley). For the HBO television film, Bronson acted against type and said &quot;it&#x27;s a complete departure for me, I&#x27;m not wearing a moustache, and I&#x27;m not carrying a gun. I don&#x27;t perform any violence in this film.&quot; He explained since he didn&#x27;t act for television in a long time, he had to think a lot about it before accepting which he did partly because of his background in mining. For his commitment on this project, Bronson dropped out of a lead role in &quot;The Delta Force&quot; (1986). Greg Burliuk of the &quot;Kingston Whig-Standard&quot; and Robert DiMatteo of &quot;The Advocate-Messenger&quot; both praised Bronson acting against type.

More typical of this period were four Cannon action films: &quot;Assassination&quot; (1987) directed by Peter R. Hunt, and three with Thompson: &quot;Death Wish 4: The Crackdown&quot; (1988), &quot;Messenger of Death&quot; (1989), and &quot;&quot; (1989).

===1990 to 1999: final roles to retirement===
Bronson declined the role of Curly Washburn in &quot;City Slickers&quot; (1991).

In 1991, Bronson acted in &quot;The Indian Runner&quot;, directed by Sean Penn. Starring David Morse and Viggo Mortensen, it is generally positively received. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said that Bronson performance &quot;is a performance of quiet, sure power. After his recent string of brainless revenge thrillers, I wondered if Bronson had sort of given up on acting, and was just going through the motions. Here he is so good it is impossible to think of another actor one would have preferred in his place&quot;.

In 1991, Bronson acted in ABC&#x27;s TV movie &quot;Yes, Virginia, There Is a Santa Claus&quot;, directed by Charles Jarrott. It is a fictionalized account on how the widely republished editorial by the same name written in 1897 came to be. In the holiday drama, Bronson plays Francis Pharcellus Church, a reporter assigned to reply to letter by a young girl, whose family is in despair facing a bleak Christmas. Linda Renaud of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that Bronson &quot;cast totally against type, is thoroughly convincing as the distraught newspaperman&quot;.

In 1993, Bronson was paired Dana Delany to lead in the CBS television film &quot;Donato and Daughter&quot;, directed by Rod Holcomb. In it, Bronson plays Delany&#x27;s father, and are both cops assigned to investigate a serial killer. In Kay Gardella&#x27;s review published in &quot;The Gazette&quot; she says &quot;Delany and Bronson work well together. Bronson shows a warmer, more caring side than his usual tough-guy image allows. And Delany, as attractive as ever, is crisp and efficient as cop.&quot;

Also that year, he acted against type playing the antagonist in Michael Anderson&#x27;s television film &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot;, an adaptation of the novel by the same name, with the lead played by Christopher Reeve. About playing the main villain Bronson had reservations and said &quot;I was a little worried about all of the dialogue. I don&#x27;t usually do that much talking in movies. And this is a bad guy. A really bad guy.&quot; Ray Loynd of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Bronson playing what&#x27;s probably his first thinking&#x27;s man heavy seems right at home.&quot;

Bronson&#x27;s last starring role in a theatrically released film was 1994&#x27;s &quot;Death Wish V: The Face of Death&quot;. The film received unfavorable reviews, many feeling that film was dull, too gory, with Bronson bored of playing that role again.

From 1995 to 1999, Bronson acted in a trilogy of TV movies as Commissioner Paul Fein, the patriarch of a family of law enforcers. They were &quot;Family of Cops&quot; (1995), &quot;Breach of Faith: A Family of Cops 2&quot; (1997), and &quot;Family of Cops 3&quot; (1999).

Bronson&#x27;s health deteriorated in his later years, and he retired from acting after undergoing hip-replacement surgery in August 1998.

== Death ==
Bronson died at age 81 on August 30, 2003, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

Although pneumonia and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease have been cited as his cause of death, neither appears on his death certificate, which cites &quot;respiratory failure&quot;, &quot;metastatic lung cancer&quot;, with, secondarily, &quot;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot; and &quot;congestive cardiomyopathy&quot; as the causes of death. He was interred at Brownsville Cemetery in West Windsor, Vermont.

==Screen persona and technique==

At the time of his death, film critic Stephen Hunter said that Bronson &quot;oozed male life-force, stoic toughness, capability, strength&quot; and &quot;always projected the charisma of ambiguity: Was he an ugly handsome man or a handsome ugly man? You were never sure, so further study was obligatory.&quot; Hunter said, &quot;he never became a great actor, but he knew exactly how to dominate a scene quietly.&quot; Bronson &quot;was the man with the name ending in a vowel ... who never left the position, never complained, never quit, never skulked. He simmered, he sulked, he bristled with class resentments, but he hung in there, got the job done and expected no thanks. His nobility was all the more palpable for never having to be expressed in words.&quot;

Bronson told critic Roger Ebert in 1974 that &quot;I&#x27;m only a product like a cake of soap, to be sold as well as possible.&quot; He said that in the action pictures he was producing at the time, there was not much time for acting. He said: &quot;I supply a presence. There are never any long dialogue scenes to establish a character. He has to be completely established at the beginning of the movie, and ready to work.&quot;

Director Michael Winner said that Bronson did not have to &quot;go into any big thing about what he does or how he does it&quot; because he had a &quot;quality that the motion-picture camera seems to respond to. He has a great strength on the screen, even when he&#x27;s standing still or in a completely passive role. There is a depth, a mystery – there is always the sense that something will happen.&quot;

== Partial accolades ==

* Nominee Emmy Awards &quot;Outstanding Performance in a Supporting Role by an Actor or Actress in a Series&quot; (1961)
* Winner Golden Globes &quot;World Film Favorite – Male&quot; (1972)
* Included on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (1980)

==Personal life==

===Character and personality===
Bronson was scarred by his early deprivation and his early struggles as an actor. A 1973 newspaper profile said that he was so shy and introverted he could not watch his own films. Bronson was described as &quot;still suspicious, still holds grudges, still despises interviews, still hates to give anything of himself, still can&#x27;t believe it has really happened to him.&quot; He was embittered that it took so long for him to be recognized in the U.S., and after achieving fame he refused to work for a noted director who had snubbed him years before.

Critic Roger Ebert wrote in 1974 that Bronson does not volunteer information, does not elaborate, and has no theories about his films. He wrote that Bronson threatened to &quot;get&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine critic Jay Cocks, who had written a negative review he viewed as a personal attack and, unlike other actors who projected violence on film, Bronson seemed violent in person.

===Marriages===
His first marriage was to Harriet Tendler, whom he met when both were fledgling actors in Philadelphia. They had two children, Suzanne and Tony, before divorcing in 1965. She was 18 years old when she met the 26-year-old Charlie Buchinsky at a Philadelphia acting school in 1947. Two years later, with the grudging consent of her father, a successful, Jewish dairy farmer, Tendler wed Buchinsky, a Catholic and a former coal miner. Tendler supported them both while she and Charlie pursued their acting dreams. On their first date, he had four cents in his pocket — and went on, now as Charles Bronson, to become one of the highest paid actors in the country.

Bronson was married to English actress Jill Ireland from October 5, 1968, until her death in 1990. He had met her in 1962, when she was married to Scottish actor David McCallum. At the time, Bronson (who shared the screen with McCallum in &quot;The Great Escape&quot;) reportedly told him, &quot;I&#x27;m going to marry your wife&quot;. The Bronsons lived in a Bel-Air mansion with seven children: two by his previous marriage, three by hers (one of whom was adopted), and two of their own, Zuleika and Katrina, the latter of whom was also adopted. After they married, she often played his leading lady, and they starred in fifteen films together.

To maintain a close family, they would load up everyone and take them to wherever filming was taking place, so that they could all be together. They spent time in a colonial farmhouse on in West Windsor, Vermont, where Ireland raised horses and provided training for their daughter Zuleika so that she could perform at the higher levels of horse showing. The family frequented Snowmass, Colorado, in the 1980s and early 1990s for the winter holidays.

On May 18, 1990, aged 54, after a long battle with breast cancer, Jill Ireland died of the disease at their home in Malibu, California. In the 1991 television film &quot;Reason for Living: The Jill Ireland Story&quot;, Bronson was portrayed by actor Lance Henriksen. On December 27, 1998, Bronson was married for a third time to Kim Weeks, an actress and former employee of Dove Audio who had helped record Ireland in the production of her audiobooks. The couple remained married until Bronson&#x27;s death in 2003.

<doc id="208202" wikidata="Q207304" url="?curid=208202" title="Estates General (France)">
<text>In France under the Ancien Régime, the Estates General ( ) or States-General was a legislative and consultative assembly of the different classes (or estates) of French subjects. It had a separate assembly for each of the three estates (clergy, nobility and commoners), which were called and dismissed by the king. It had no true power in its own right as, unlike the English Parliament, it was not required to approve royal taxation or legislation. It served as an advisory body to the king, primarily by presenting petitions from the various estates and consulting on fiscal policy. 

The Estates General first met in 1302 and 1303 in relation to King Philip IV&#x27;s conflict with the papacy. They met intermittently until 1614 and only once afterward, in 1789, but were not definitively dissolved until after the French Revolution. The Estates General were distinct from the &quot;parlements&quot; (the most powerful of which was the Parlement of Paris), which started as appellate courts but later used their powers to decide whether to publish laws to claim a legislative role. 

The Estates General had similarities with institutions in other European polities, generally known as the Estates, such as the States General of the Netherlands, the Parliament of England, the Estates of Parliament of Scotland, the Sejm of Poland-Lithuania, the Cortes of Portugal, the Cortes of Spain, the Imperial Diet (&quot;Reichstag&quot;) of the Holy Roman Empire, the Diets () of the &quot;Lands&quot;, the Parliamentum Publicum of Hungary, and the Swedish Riksdag of the Estates. Unlike some of these institutions, however, France&#x27;s Estates General were only summoned at irregular intervals by the king, and never grew into a permanent legislative body.

==Origin==
The first national assembly of the Estates General was in 1302, summoned by King Philip IV, to address a conflict with Pope Boniface VIII. The letters summoning the assembly of 1302 are published by Georges Picot in his collection of &quot;Documents inédits pour servir à l&#x27;histoire de France&quot;. During Philip&#x27;s reign, the Estates General were subsequently assembled several times to give him aid by granting subsidies. Over time, subsidies came to be the most frequent motive for their convocation.

The composition and powers of the Estates General remained the same: they always included representatives of the First Estate (clergy), Second Estate (the nobility), and Third Estate (commoners: all others), and monarchs always summoned them either to grant subsidies or to advise the Crown, to give aid and counsel. Their composition, however, as well as their effective powers, varied greatly at different times. 

In their primitive form in the 14th and the first half of the 15th centuries, the Estates General had only a limited elective element. The lay lords and the ecclesiastical lords (bishops and other high clergy) who made up the Estates General were not elected by their peers, but directly chosen and summoned by the king. In the order of the clergy, however, certain ecclesiastical bodies, e.g. abbeys and chapters of cathedrals, were also summoned to the assembly. Since these bodies, being persons in the moral but not in the physical sense, could not appear in person, their representative had to be chosen by the monks of the convent or the canons of the chapter.

Only representatives of the Third Estate were chosen by election. Originally, all commoners were not called upon to seek representation in the estates. Only the &quot;bonnes villes&quot;, or the privileged towns, were called upon. They were represented by elected &quot;procureurs&quot;, who were frequently the municipal officials of the town, but deputies were also elected for the purpose. The country districts, the &quot;plat pays&quot;, were not represented. Even within the &quot;bonnes villes&quot;, the franchise was quite narrow.

==Rise and fall of power==
The effective powers of the Estates General likewise varied over time. In the 14th century, they were considerable. The king could not, in theory, levy general taxation. Even in the provinces attached to the domain of the Crown, he could levy it only where he had retained the &quot;haute justice&quot; over the inhabitants, but not on the subjects of lords having the &quot;haute justice&quot;. The privileged towns generally had the right of taxing themselves. To collect general taxes, the king required consent of the lay and ecclesiastical lords, and of the towns. This amounted to needing authorization from the Estates General, which granted these subsidies only temporarily and for fairly short periods. As a result, they were summoned frequently and their power over the Crown became considerable.

In the second half of the 14th century, however, certain royal taxes, levied throughout the Crown&#x27;s domain, tended to become permanent and independent of the vote of the estates. This result drew from many causes, particularly, the Crown endeavoured to transform and change the nature of the &quot;feudal aid&quot; to levy a general tax by right, on its own authority, in such cases as those in which a lord could demand feudal aid from his vassals. For instance, the Crown thus raised the necessary taxes for twenty years to pay the ransom of King John II of France without a vote of the Estates General, although the assembly met several times during this period. Custom confined this tendency. During the second half of the 15th century, the chief taxes, the &quot;taille&quot;, &quot;aids&quot; and &quot;gabelle&quot; became definitely permanent for the benefit of the Crown. In some cases, there was formal consent of the Estates General, as in 1437 in the case of the &quot;aids&quot;.

The critical periods of the Hundred Years&#x27; War favoured the Estates General, though at the price of great sacrifices. Under the reign of King John II, from 1355 to 1358, the Estates General had controlled not only the voting but, through their commissaries, the administration of and jurisdiction over the taxes. In the first half of the reign of Charles VII, they had been summoned almost every year and had dutifully voted subsidies for the Crown. But when the struggle was over, they renounced the power of the purse.

At the estates of 1484, however, after the death of Louis XI, the Duke of Orleans sought to obtain the regency during the minority of Charles VIII. The Estates sided with Charles&#x27;s sister Anne de Beaujeu and refused. 

Deputies of the three orders united their efforts in the hope of regaining the right of periodically sanctioning taxation. They voted the &quot;taille&quot; for two years only, at the same time reducing it to the amount it had reached at the end of the reign of Charles VII. They demanded, and obtained, the promise of the Crown that they should be summoned again before the two years had ended. But this promise was not kept, and the Estates General were not summoned again until 1560. During this 76-year interim, successive kings expanded the role of the centralised state through various means. In the mid-16th century, public officials (&quot;officiers&quot;) explored the option of forming a fourth order of their own kind but their attempts went nowhere, largely because of the attractiveness of becoming nobility to many of them.

==Revival in 1560–1614==
The Estates General was revived in the second half of the 16th century because of scarcity of money and the quarrels and Wars of Religion. There would be estates at Orleans in 1560, followed by those of Pontoise in 1561, and those of Blois in 1576 and 1588. Those of 1588 ended with a coup d&#x27;état by Henri III, and the States summoned by the League, which sat in Paris in 1593 and whose chief object was to elect a Catholic king, were not a success. The Estates General again met in Paris , on the occasion of the disturbances that followed the death of Henry IV; however, though their minutes bear witness to their sentiments of exalted patriotism, dissensions between the three orders rendered them weak. They dissolved before completing their work and were not summoned again until 1789.

As to the question whether the Estates General formed one or three chambers for the purposes of their working, from the constitutional point of view the point was never decided. What the king required was to have the consent, the resolution of the three estates of the realm; it was in reality of little importance to him whether their resolutions expressed themselves in common or separately. At the Estates General of 1484, the elections were made in common for the three orders, and the deputies also arrived at their resolutions in common. But after 1560, the rule was that each order deliberate separately; the royal declaration of 23 June 1789 (at the outbreak of the French Revolution) even stated that they formed three distinct chambers. But Necker&#x27;s report to the &quot;conseil du roi&quot; according to which the convocation of 1789 was decided, said (as did the declaration of 23 June), that on matters of common interest the deputies of the three orders could deliberate together, if each of the others decided by a separate vote in favour of this, and if the king consented.

The working of the Estates General led to an almost exclusive system of deliberation by committees. There were, it is true, solemn general sessions, called &quot;séances royales&quot;, because the king presided; but at these there was no discussion. At the first, the king or his chancellor announced the object of the convocation, and set forth the demands or questions put to them by the Crown; at the other royal sessions each order made known its answers or observations by the mouth of an &quot;orateur&quot; elected for the purpose. But almost all useful work was done in the &quot;sections&quot;, among which the deputies of each order were divided. At the estates of 1484, they were divided into six &quot;nations&quot; or &quot;sections&quot;, corresponding to the six &quot;généralités&quot; then existing. Subsequently, the deputies belonging to the same &quot;gouvernement&quot; formed a group or &quot;bureau&quot; for deliberating and voting purposes. Certain questions, however, were discussed and decided in full assembly; sometimes, too, the estates nominated commissaries in equal numbers for each order. But in the ancient Estates General, there was never any personal vote. The unit represented for each of the three orders was the &quot;bailliage&quot; or &quot;sénéchaussé&quot; and each &quot;bailliage&quot; had one vote, the majority of the deputies of the &quot;bailliage&quot; deciding in what way this vote should be given.

At the estates of the 16th century, voting was by &quot;gouvernements&quot;, each &quot;gouvernement&quot; having one vote, but the majority of the &quot;bailliages&quot; composing the &quot;gouvernement&quot; decided how it should be given.

The Estates General, when they gave counsel, had in theory only a consultative faculty. They had the power of granting subsidies, which was the chief and ordinary cause of their convocation. But it had come to be a consent with which the king could dispense, as permanent taxation became established. In the 16th century, however, the estates again claimed that their consent was necessary for the establishment of new taxation, and, on the whole, the facts seemed to be in favour of this view at the time. However, in the course of the 17th century the principle gained recognition that the king could tax on his own sole authority. Thus were established in the second half of the 17th century, and in the 18th, the direct taxes of the &quot;capitation&quot; and of the &quot;dixième&quot; or &quot;vingtième&quot;, and many indirect taxes. It was sufficient for the law creating them to be registered by the &quot;cours des aides&quot; and the &quot;parlements&quot;. It was only in 1787 that the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris declared that it could not register the new taxes, the land-tax and stamp duty (&quot;subvention territoriale&quot; and &quot;impôt du timbre&quot;), as they did not know whether they would be submitted to by the country, and that the consent of the representatives of the tax-payers must be asked.

The Estates General had legally no share in the legislative power, which belonged to the king alone. The Estates of Blois demanded in 1576 that the king be bound to turn into law any proposition voted in identical terms by each of the three orders; but Henry III would not grant this demand, which would not even have left him a right of veto. In practice, however, the Estates General contributed largely to legislation. Those who sat in them had at all times the right of presenting complaints (&quot;doléances&quot;), requests and petitions to the king; in this, indeed, consisted their sole initiative. They were usually answered by an &quot;ordonnance&quot;, and it is chiefly through these that we are acquainted with the activity of the estates of the 14th and 15th centuries.

In the latest form, and from the estates of 1484 onwards, this was done by a new and special procedure. The Estates had become an entirely elective assembly, and at the elections (at each step of the election if there were several) the electors drew up a &quot;cahier de doléances&quot; (statement of grievances), which they requested the deputies to present. This even appeared to be the most important feature of an election. The deputies of each order in every &quot;bailliage&quot; also brought with them a &quot;cahier des doléances&quot;, arrived at, for the third estate, by a combination of statements drawn up by the primary or secondary electors. On the assembly of the estates, the &quot;cahiers&quot; of the &quot;bailliages&quot; were incorporated into a &quot;cahier&quot; for each &quot;gouvernement&quot;, and these again into a &quot;cahier general&quot; or general statement, which was presented to the king, and which he answered in his council. When the three orders deliberated in common, as in 1484, there was only one &quot;cahier général&quot;; when they deliberated separately, there were three, one for each order. The drawing up of the &quot;cahier general&quot; was looked upon as the main business (&quot;le grand œuvre&quot;) of the session.

By this means, the Estates General furnished the material for numerous &quot;ordonnances&quot;, though the king did not always adopt the propositions contained in the &quot;cahiers&quot;, and often modified them in forming them into an &quot;ordonnance&quot;. These latter were the &quot;ordonnances de reforme&quot; (reforming ordinances), treating of the most varied subjects, according to the demands of the &quot;cahiers&quot;. They were not, however, for the most part very well observed. The last of the type was the &quot;grande ordonnance&quot; of 1629 (&quot;Code Michau&quot;), drawn up in accordance with the &quot;cahiers&quot; of 1614 and with the observations of various assemblies of notables that followed them.

The peculiar power of the Estates General was recognized, but was of a kind that could not often be exercised. It was, essentially, a constituent power. The ancient public law of France contained a number of rules called the &quot;fundamental laws of the kingdom&quot; (&quot;lois fondamentales du royaume&quot;), though most of them were purely customary. Chief among these were rules that determined the succession to the Crown and rules forbidding alienation of the domain of the Crown. The king, supreme though his power might be, could not abrogate, modify or infringe them. But it was admitted that he might do so by the consent of the Estates General. The Estates could give the king a dispensation from a fundamental law in a given instance; they could even, in agreement with the king, make new fundamental laws. The Estates of Blois of 1576 and 1588 offer entirely convincing precedents in this respect. It was universally recognized that in the event of the line of Hugh Capet becoming extinct, it would be the function of the States-General to elect a new king.

The Estates General of 1614 proved the last for over a century and a half. A new convocation had indeed been announced to take place on the majority of Louis XIII, and letters were even issued in view of the elections, but this ended in nothing. Absolute monarchy progressively became definitely established, and appeared incompatible with the institution of the Estates General. Liberal minds, however, in the entourage of Louis, duc de Bourgogne, who were preparing a new plan of government in view of his expected accession to the French throne in succession to Louis XIV, thought of reviving the institution. It figures in the projects of Saint-Simon and Fénelon, though the latter would have preferred to begin with an assembly of non-elected notables. But though St Simon stood high in the favor of the regent Orléans, the death of Louis XIV did not see a summoning of the Estates.

==1789==
At the time of the revolution, the First Estate comprised 100,000 Catholic clergy and owned 5–10% of the lands in France—the highest per capita of any estate. All property of the First Estate was tax exempt. 

The Second Estate comprised the nobility, which consisted of 400,000 people, including women and children. Since the death of Louis XIV in 1715, the nobles had enjoyed a resurgence in power. By the time of the revolution, they had almost a monopoly over distinguished government service, higher offices in the church, army, and parliaments, and most other public and semi-public honors. Under the principle of feudal precedent, they were not taxed. 

The Third Estate comprised about 25 million people: the bourgeoisie, the peasants, and everyone else in France. Unlike the First and Second Estates, the Third Estate were compelled to pay taxes. The bourgeoisie found ways to evade them and become exempt. The major burden of the French government fell upon the poorest in French society: the farmers, peasantry, and working poor. The Third Estate had considerable resentment toward the upper classes. 

In 1789, the Estates General was summoned for the first time since 1614. As François Fénelon had promoted in the 17th century, an Assembly of Notables in 1787 (which already displayed great independence) preceded the Estates General session. According to Fénelon&#x27;s model of 1614, the Estates General would consist of equal numbers of representatives of each Estate. During the Revolution, the Third Estate demanded, and ultimately received, double representation, which they already had achieved in the provincial assemblies. When the Estates General convened in Versailles on 5 May 1789, however, it became clear that the double representation was something of a sham: voting was to occur &quot;by orders&quot;, which meant that the collective vote of the 578 representatives of the Third Estate would be weighed the same as that of each of the other, less numerous Estates.

Royal efforts to focus solely on taxes failed totally. The Estates General reached an immediate impasse, debating (with each of the three estates meeting separately) its own structure rather than the nation&#x27;s finances. On 28 May 1789, Abbé Sieyès moved that the Third Estate, now meeting as the &quot;Communes&quot; (), proceed with verification of its own powers and invite the other two estates to take part, but not to wait for them. They proceeded to do so, completing the process on June 17. They voted a measure far more radical, declaring themselves the National Assembly, an assembly not of the Estates but of &quot;the People&quot;. They invited the other orders to join them, but emphasized that they intended to conduct the nation&#x27;s affairs with or without them.

King Louis XVI of France tried to resist. When he shut down the Salle des États where the Assembly met, the Assembly moved its deliberations to a nearby tennis court. They swore the Tennis Court Oath (20 June 1789), under which they agreed not to separate until they had given France a constitution. A majority of the representatives of the clergy soon joined them, as did forty-seven members of the nobility. By 27 June, the royal party had overtly given in. But military forces began to arrive in large numbers around Paris and Versailles. Messages of support for the Assembly poured in from Paris and other French cities. On 9 July, the Assembly reconstituted itself as the National Constituent Assembly.

<doc id="208204" wikidata="Q210341" url="?curid=208204" title="Boat-billed heron">
<text>The boat-billed heron (Cochlearius cochlearius), colloquially known as the boatbill, is an atypical member of the heron family. It is the only member of the genus Cochlearius and was formerly placed in a monotypic family, the Cochleariidae. It lives in mangrove swamps from Mexico south to Peru and Brazil. It is a nocturnal bird, and breeds semicolonially in mangrove trees, laying two to four bluish-white eggs in a twig nest.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the boat-billed heron in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in French Guiana. He used the French name &quot;La Cuillière&quot; and the Latin &quot;Cochlearius&quot;. Brisson placed the species in a new genus &quot;Cochlearius&quot; (with the same name as that of the species). When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the boat-billed heron. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Cancroma cochlearia&quot;, and cited Brisson&#x27;s work.

Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). However, Brisson also introduced names for genera and these are accepted by the ICZN. The boat-billed heron is now placed in Brisson&#x27;s genus and has the tautonym &quot;Cochlearius cochlearius&quot;. The name &quot;Cochlearius&quot; is from the Latin , &quot;,&quot; or &quot;&quot; for a &quot;spoon in the form of a snail shell&quot;.

There are five subspecies:
* &quot;C. c. zeledoni&quot; (Ridgway, 1885) – west Mexico
* &quot;C. c. phillipsi&quot; Dickerman, 1973 – east Mexico, Belize
* &quot;C. c. ridgwayi&quot; Dickerman, 1973 – south Mexico to Honduras
* &quot;C. c. panamensis&quot; Griscom, 1926 – Costa Rica and Panama
* &quot;C. c. cochlearius&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – north and central South America

==Description==
The boat-billed heron grows to about long. Adults are pale grey to white in color, with chestnut-colored abdomens and black flanks. The massive, broad, scoop-like bill, which gives rise to this species&#x27; name, is mainly black. This bird is also adorned with a crest which is thought to be used in mate attraction as it is larger in males. The sexes are similar in appearance, the main differences being that females are slightly smaller, grayer in appearance, and have shorter crests than males. Newly hatched nestlings have green-yellow skin, with their upperparts covered in gray down feathers. Their upper bill is black and they have green-yellow legs. Juveniles are darker in color than adults and lack a crest.

==Distribution and habitat==
Boat-billed herons range from Mexico to Peru, Brazil, and northeastern Argentina. They are nonmigratory birds that tend to live in seasonal lagoons and estuaries, and nest in mangroves.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
Boat-billed herons breed during the rainy season and have been recorded as producing two clutches during this time, laying their first clutch in February during the end of the dry season. Their clutch sizes range from two to four eggs, with more eggs being laid during the first nesting period than the second. They usually nest in colonies but have been observed nesting solitarily. Human disturbance can lead to a decrease in reproductive success, as herons tend to avoid human contact and will abandon nests if necessary.

===Food and feeding===
Boat-billed herons feed on small mammals, amphibians, annelids, molluscs, insects, crabs, shrimp such as &quot;Penaeus&quot; and &quot;Macrobrachium&quot;, and small fish such as &quot;Dormitator latifrons&quot;, a species of sleeper goby. Other fish preyed upon include mullet, snook, and catfish. They tend to forage in vegetative streams, shallow water, and lagoons. When foraging in streams, they use low-hanging branches and mangrove roots to stand over the water. In ponds, they will walk slowly through the water up to deep or will forage near the water&#x27;s edge. In order to capture prey they will lunge at fish or scoop the surface of the water with their bills which are uniquely shaped for this method of capture. Additionally, they have been observed using two different feeding techniques; standing and slowly stalking prey, or disturbing the water and chasing prey.
Boat-billed herons will forage nocturnally and have been seen leaving the roost 30 minutes after sundown to feed. It has been observed that they do not feed when a light source is present such as daylight, moonlight, or artificial light. One study hypothesized that in order to forage for food in the dark and in shallow, muddy water, their bills are sensitive to touch, which helps them feel for their prey.

<text>The States General of the Netherlands ( ) is the supreme bicameral legislature of the Netherlands consisting of the Senate () and the House of Representatives (). Both chambers meet at the Binnenhof in The Hague.

The States General originated in the 15th century as an assembly of all the provincial states of the Burgundian Netherlands. In 1579, during the Dutch Revolt, the States General split as the northern provinces openly rebelled against Philip II, and the northern States General replaced Philip II as the supreme authority of the Dutch Republic in 1581. The States General were replaced by the National Assembly after the Batavian Revolution of 1795, only to be restored in 1814, when the country had regained its sovereignty. The States General was divided into a Senate and a House of Representatives in 1815, with the establishment of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. After the constitutional amendment of 1848, members of the House of Representatives were directly elected, and the rights of the States General were vastly extended, practically establishing parliamentary democracy in the Netherlands.

Since 1918, the members of the House of Representatives have been elected for four years using party-list proportional representation, while the 75 members of the Senate are elected by the States-Provincial every four years. On exceptional occasions as stipulated by the Constitution or the Charter for the Kingdom, the two houses form a joint session known as the United Assembly (&quot;verenigde vergadering)&quot;. The president of the Senate serves as President of the States General during a United Assembly.

==Etymology==
The archaic Dutch word &quot;staten&quot; originally related to the feudal classes (&quot;estates&quot;, or in Dutch) in which medieval European societies were stratified; the clergy, the nobility and the commons. The word eventually came to mean the &quot;political body&quot; in which the respective estates were represented. Each province in the Habsburg Netherlands had its own &quot;staten&quot;. These representative bodies (and not their constituent estates) in turn were represented in the assembly that came to be known as (a plurale tantum), or (General States). The English word &quot;states&quot; may have a similar meaning as the Dutch word &quot;staten&quot;, as in e.g. States of Jersey. The English phrases &quot;States General&quot; is probably a literal translation of the Dutch word. Historically, the same term was used for the name of other national legislatures as, for example, the Catalan and Valencian Generalitat and the Estates General of France during the Ancien Régime.

Several geographic place names are derived from the States General. In 1609, Henry Hudson established Dutch trade in Staten Island, New York City and named the island after the States General. Isla de los Estados, now an Argentine island, was also named after this institution, the Spanish name being a translation of the Dutch name. Abel Tasman originally gave the name Staten Landt to what would become New Zealand. Staaten River is a river in the Cape York Peninsula, Australia.

==History==
===Burgundian and Habsburg rule===
Historically, the convocation of the States General consisted of delegates from the States of the several provinces, like the States of Brabant, and dated from about the middle of the 15th century, under the rule of the Dukes of Burgundy. The first important session was the Estates General of 1464 that met on 9 January 1464 in Bruges, Flanders, on the initiative of the States of Holland, the States of Flanders, and the States of Brabant, with the initially reluctant agreement of Philip the Good. Later, regular sessions were held at Coudenberg in Brussels, Brabant. The next important event was the convocation of the States General by the ducal Council for 3 February 1477 after the death of Charles the Bold. In this session the States General forced the grant of the Great Privilege by Mary of Burgundy in which the right of the States General to convene on their own initiative was recognised. The main function of the States General in these early years was to form a platform for the central government to discuss matters of general importance with the States of the provinces, especially the special subsidies known as &quot;beden&quot; or &quot;aides&quot;. Legislative and executive functions were still reserved for the Sovereign in these years

===Dutch Republic===

At the start of the Dutch Revolt the States General (who were then not continually in session) remained loyal to the overlord of the Habsburg Netherlands, Philip II of Spain (who did not have the title of King in the Netherlands, but held the title of duke and count in the several provinces, and was just a Lord of the Netherlands). In 1576 the States General as a whole, however, openly rebelled against the Spanish crown. In 1579 the States General split as a number of southern provinces, united in the Union of Arras returned to obedience, while other provinces, united in the Union of Utrecht continued the rebellion. After the Act of Abjuration in 1581 the northern States General replaced Philip II as the supreme authority of the northern Netherlands, which then became known as the United Provinces.

This was a confederation in which most government functions remained with the provincial States (and local authorities, like the Vroedschappen). These delegated representatives to the States General as a kind of ambassadors acting with a mandate limited by instruction and obligatory consultation (). The States General, in which the voting was by province, each of the seven provinces having one vote, took on many executive functions after the Council of State of the Netherlands had temporarily come under English influence, due to the Treaty of Nonsuch. The States General for this reason since 1593 remained continually in session until their dissolution in 1795. The presidency rotated weekly among the senior representatives of the provinces. Under the Union of Utrecht treaty the States General formally was the sovereign power, representing the Republic in foreign affairs and making treaties with foreign monarchs. As such the honorific title of the States General collectively was (mightiest, or very mighty, lords).
Due to the vagaries of the Eighty Years&#x27; War in which territories were lost and (partially) reconquered, not all territories that had originally signed up for the Union of Utrecht remained represented in the States General. The States of Brabant and of Flanders lost their representation after 1587 as most of their territory had been conquered by the Army of Flanders, and it was not restored after part of that territory (together with parts of the Duchy of Limburg) was reconquered by the Dutch Republic. The Drenthe territory was never directly represented in the States General.
Twenty per cent of the new Republic&#x27;s territory, known as the Generality Lands, was so under the direct rule of the &quot;Generality&quot; (). The Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company were also under its &quot;general&quot; supervision; for this reason Staten Island in New York City (originally New Amsterdam) and Staten Island, Argentina (Discovered by Dutchman Jacob le Maire), are among places named after the .

The &quot;southern&quot; States General after 1579 were a continuation of the States General as they had been under the Habsburg Netherlands. After the (re)conquest of most of the territory of the States of Brabant and of Flanders these States again sent representatives to these States General for the Southern Netherlands, together with the &quot;obedient&quot; provinces of the Union of Arras. The southern States General only occasionally came in session, however. The last regular session was in 1634, when Philip IV of Spain dissolved them.

The States General in both The Hague and Brussels came to an end after 1795; the South was annexed by France, and the North saw the proclamation of the Batavian Republic and the subsequent convocation of the National Assembly (1 March 1796).

===Kingdom of the Netherlands===
The name was resurrected in the title of subsequent Dutch parliaments in and after 1814, after the end of the annexation to the First French Empire by Napoleon I of France in 1813. These had, however, little resemblance to the States General under the Republic. Beginning with the Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands the States General was a unicameral legislature, without executive functions, in which the 55 representatives no longer represented the States-Provincial (though those newly constituted entities elected them, now acting as electoral colleges), but the entire people of the Netherlands and without (the Netherlands had become a unitary state under the Batavian Republic and the federal structure of the Dutch Republic was not restored). The States General became a bicameral legislature under the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815, in which the 50 members of the Senate were appointed for life by the new King from the resurrected , representative bodies of the aristocracy, and the 110 members of the House of Representatives (55 for the North and 55 for the South) were elected by the States-Provincial (in their new form).

After the Belgian Revolution of 1830 under the Kingdom of the Netherlands the States General remained bicameral, but after the revision of the Constitution of the Netherlands in 1848, the (now 39) members of the Senate were elected by the States-Provincial, and the members of the House of Representatives were directly elected in electoral districts (one for every 45,000 electors, so the number of members of that House became variable for a while). The House of Representatives became more powerful at the same time, as it received the important rights of inquiry and amendment, while its budgetary rights were strengthened. Formally, the position of the States General was strengthened, because henceforth the ministers of the Crown became politically accountable to them, making the role of the King largely ceremonial.

With the constitutional revision of 1888 the number of members of the House of Representatives was fixed at 100, while the Senate was enlarged to 50 members. The suffrage was enlarged at the same time, but still limited to male citizens possessing a certain wealth. Universal male suffrage would be granted in 1917 and women would receive suffrage in 1919. At this occasion, the electoral system was changed to proportional representation. The States General were suspended from 1940 to 1945, during the German occupation. In 1956 the number of members of the Senate was enlarged to 75, and that of the House of Representatives to 150.

==Functions==


The States General meets in joint session at least once a year, at the opening of the parliamentary year, when the king gives his Speech from the Throne on Prince&#x27;s Day. On special occasions, such as when a States Generate vote on a marriage of a member of the royal house, an inauguration of the monarch, or the death of a member of the royal house, both houses also meet in a joint session (), with the president of the Senate presiding. They take place in the Ridderzaal (Hall of Knights) in the Binnenhof, except for the inauguration of the monarch, which occurs in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. The rest of the time, the two chambers sit separately.

Constitutionally, all functions of the parliament are given to both houses, except for the rights of initiative and amendment, which only the has. The Joint Session also appoints the monarch if there is no heir to the throne and the regent is unable to exercise his or her powers.

An important question is whether the relationship between cabinet and parliament should be dualistic or monistic. That is, whether ministers and leaders of governing parliamentary parties should prepare important political decisions. According to the dualistic position, members of parliament of governing parties should remain independent of the cabinet. The term &quot;monism&quot; is used to refer to a stance that important decisions should be prepared by the people of the governing coalition in order to promote political stability.

<text>The shoebill (Balaeniceps rex), also known as the whale-headed stork, and shoe-billed stork, is a large long-legged wading bird. It derives its name from its enormous shoe-shaped bill. It has a somewhat stork-like overall form and has previously been classified with the storks in the order Ciconiiformes based on this morphology. However, genetic evidence places it with pelicans and herons in the Pelecaniformes. The adult is mainly grey while the juveniles are more brown. It lives in tropical East Africa in large swamps from South Sudan to Zambia.

==Taxonomy==

The shoebill may have been known to Ancient Egyptians but was not classified until the 19th century, after skins and eventually live specimens were brought to Europe. John Gould very briefly described it in 1850 from the skin of a specimen collected on the upper White Nile by the English traveller Mansfield Parkyns. Gould provided a more detailed description in the following year. He placed the species in its own genus &quot;Balaeniceps&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Balaeniceps rex&quot;. The genus name comes from the Latin words &quot;balaena&quot; &quot;whale&quot;, and &quot;caput&quot; &quot;head&quot;, abbreviated to &quot;-ceps&quot; in compound words. Alternative common names are whalebill, shoe-billed stork and whale-headed stork.

Traditionally considered as allied with the storks (Ciconiiformes), it was retained there in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy which lumped a massive number of unrelated taxa into their &quot;Ciconiiformes&quot;. Based on osteological evidence, the suggestion of a pelecaniform affinity was made in 1957 by Patricia Cottam. Microscopic analysis of eggshell structure by Konstantin Mikhailov in 1995 found that the eggshells of shoebills closely resembled those of other Pelecaniformes in having a covering of thick microglobular material over the crystalline shells. In 2003, the shoebill was again suggested as closer to the pelicans (based on anatomical comparisons) or the herons (based on biochemical evidence). A 2008 DNA study reinforces their membership among the Pelecaniformes.

So far, two fossilized relatives of the shoebill have been described: &quot;Goliathia&quot; from the Early Oligocene of Egypt and &quot;Paludiavis&quot; from the Late Miocene of Pakistan and Tunisia. It has been suggested that the enigmatic African fossil bird &quot;Eremopezus&quot; have features resembling those of the shoebill and the secretary bird.

==Description==

The shoebill is a tall bird, with a typical height range of and some specimens reaching as much as . Length from tail to beak can range from and wingspan is . Weight has reportedly ranged from . A male will weigh on average around and is larger than a typical female of . The signature feature of the species is its huge, bulbous bill, which is straw-coloured with erratic greyish markings. The exposed culmen (or the measurement along the top of the upper mandible) is , the third longest bill among extant birds after pelicans and large storks, and can outrival the pelicans in bill circumference, especially if the bill is considered as the hard, bony keratin portion. As in the pelicans, the upper mandible is strongly keeled, ending in a sharp nail. The dark coloured legs are fairly long, with a tarsus length of . The shoebill&#x27;s feet are exceptionally large, with the middle toe reaching in length, likely assisting the species in its ability to stand on aquatic vegetation while hunting. The neck is relatively shorter and thicker than other long-legged wading birds such as herons and cranes. The wings are broad, with a wing chord length of , and well-adapted to soaring.
The plumage of adult birds is blue-grey with darker slaty-grey flight feathers. The breast presents some elongated feathers, which have dark shafts. The juvenile has a similar plumage colour, but is a darker grey with a brown tinge. When they are first born, shoebills have a more modestly-sized bill, which is initially silvery-grey. The bill becomes more noticeably large when the chicks are 23 days old and becomes well developed by 43 days.

===Voice===
The shoebill is normally silent, but they perform bill-clattering displays at the nest. When engaging in these displays, adult birds have also been noted to utter a cow-like &quot;moo&quot; as well as high-pitched whines. Both nestlings and adults engage in bill-clattering during the nesting season as a means of communication. When young are begging for food, they call out with a sound uncannily like human hiccups. In one case, a flying adult bird was heard uttering hoarse croaks, apparently as a sign of aggression at a nearby marabou stork (&quot;Leptoptilos crumeniferus&quot;).

===Flight pattern===
Its wings are held flat while soaring and, as in the pelicans and the storks of the genus &quot;Leptoptilos&quot;, the shoebill flies with its neck retracted. Its flapping rate, at an estimated 150 flaps per minute, is one of the slowest of any bird, with the exception of the larger stork species. The pattern is alternating flapping and gliding cycles of approximately seven seconds each, putting its gliding distance somewhere between the larger storks and the Andean condor (&quot;Vultur gryphus&quot;). When flushed, shoebills usually try to fly no more than . Long flights of the shoebill are rare, and only a few flights beyond its minimum foraging distance of have been recorded.

==Distribution and habitat==
The shoebill is distributed in freshwater swamps of central tropical Africa, from southern Sudan and South Sudan through parts of eastern Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, western Tanzania and northern Zambia. The species is most numerous in the West Nile sub-region and South Sudan (especially the Sudd, a main stronghold for the species); it is also significant in wetlands of Uganda and western Tanzania. More isolated records have been reported of shoebills in Kenya, the Central African Republic, northern Cameroon, south-western Ethiopia, and Malawi. Vagrant strays to the Okavango Basin, Botswana and the upper Congo River have also been sighted. The distribution of this species seems to largely coincide with that of papyrus and lungfish. They are often found in areas of flood plain interspersed with undisturbed papyrus and reedbeds. When shoebill storks are in an area with deep water, a bed of floating vegetation is a requirement. They are also found where there is poorly oxygenated water. This causes the fish living in the water to surface for air more often, increasing the likelihood a shoebill stork will successfully capture it. The shoebill is non-migratory with limited seasonal movements due to habitat changes, food availability and disturbance by humans.

Petroglyphs from Oued Djerat, eastern Algeria, show that the shoebill occurred during the Early Holocene much more to the north, in the wetlands that covered the present-day Sahara Desert at that time.

The shoebill occurs in extensive, dense freshwater marshes. Almost all wetlands that attract the species have undisturbed &quot;Cyperus papyrus&quot; and reed beds of &quot;Phragmites&quot; and &quot;Typha&quot;. Although their distribution largely seems to correspond with the distribution of papyrus in central Africa, the species seems to avoid pure papyrus swamps and is often attracted to areas with mixed vegetation. More rarely, the species has been seen foraging in rice fields and flooded plantations.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The shoebill is noted for its slow movements and tendency to stay still for long periods, resulting in descriptions of the species as &quot;statue-like&quot;. They are quite sensitive to human disturbance and may abandon their nests if flushed by humans. However, while foraging, if dense vegetation stands between it and humans, this wader can be fairly tame. The shoebill is often attracted to poorly oxygenated waters such as swamps, marshes, and bogs where fish frequently surface to breathe. They also seem to exhibit migratory behaviors based upon differences in the surface water level. Immature shoebills abandon nesting sites which increased in the surface water level whereas adult shoebills abandon nesting sites which decreased in surface water level. It is suggested that both adult and immature shoebills prefer nesting sites with similar surface water levels. Exceptionally for a bird this large, the shoebill often stands and perches on floating vegetation, making them appear somewhat like a giant jacana, although the similarly sized and occasionally sympatric Goliath heron (&quot;Ardea goliath&quot;) is also known to stand on aquatic vegetation. Shoebills, being solitary, forage at or more from one another even where relatively densely populated. This species stalks its prey patiently, in a slow and lurking fashion. While hunting, the shoebill strides very slowly and is frequently motionless. Unlike some other large waders, this species hunts entirely using vision and is not known to engage in tactile hunting. When prey is spotted, it launches a quick violent strike. However, depending on the size of the prey, handling time after the strike can exceed 10 minutes. Around 60% of strikes yield prey. Frequently water and vegetation is snatched up during the strike and is spilled out from the edges of the mandibles. The activity of hippopotamus may inadvertently benefit the shoebill, as submerged hippos occasionally force fish to the surface.

===Breeding===
The solitary nature of shoebills extends to their breeding habits. Nests typically occur at less than three nests per square kilometre, unlike herons, cormorants, pelicans, and storks, which predominantly nest in colonies. The breeding pair of shoebills vigorously defends a territory of from conspecifics. In the extreme north and south of the species&#x27; range, nesting starts right after the rains end. In more central regions of the range, it may nest near the end of the wet season in order for the eggs to hatch around the beginning of the following wet season. Both parents engage in building the nest on a floating platform after clearing out an area of approximately across. The large, flattish nesting platform is often partially submerged in water and can be as much as deep. The nest itself is about wide. Both the nest and platform are made of aquatic vegetation. From one to three white eggs are laid. These eggs measure high by and weigh around . Incubation lasts for approximately 30 days. Both parents actively brood, shade, guard and feed the nestling, though the females are perhaps slightly more attentive. Shoebills use their mandibles to cool their eggs with water during days with high temperatures around . They fill their mandible once, swallow the water, and fill another mandible full of water before proceeding back to their nest where they pour out the water and regurgitate the previously swallowed water onto both the nest and eggs. Food items are regurgitated whole from the gullet straight into the bill of the young. Shoebills rarely raise more than one chick but will hatch more. The younger chicks usually die and are intended as &quot;back-ups&quot; in case the eldest chick dies or is weak. Fledging is reached at around 105 days and the young birds can fly well by 112 days. However, they are still fed for possibly a month or more after this. It will take the young shoebills three years before they become fully sexually mature.

Shoebills are elusive when nesting, so cameras must be placed to observe them from afar to collect behavioral data. There is an advantage for birds that are early breeders, as the chicks are tended for a longer period.

===Diet===
Shoebills are largely piscivorous but are assured predators of a considerable range of wetland vertebrates. Preferred prey species have reportedly included marbled lungfish (&quot;Protopterus aethiopicus&quot;), African lungfish (&quot;Protopterus annectens&quot;), and Senegal bichir (&quot;Polypterus senegalus&quot;), various &quot;Tilapia&quot; species and catfish, the latter mainly in the genus &quot;Clarias&quot;. Other prey eaten by this species has included frogs, water snakes, Nile monitors (&quot;Varanus niloticus&quot;) and baby crocodiles. More rarely, small turtles, snails, rodents, small waterfowl and carrion have reportedly been eaten.

Given its sharp-edged beak, huge bill, and wide gape, the shoebill can hunt large prey, often targeting prey bigger than is taken by other large wading birds. In the Bangweulu Swamps of Zambia, fish eaten by this species are commonly in the range of . The main prey items fed to young by the parents were the catfish &quot;Clarias gariepinus&quot;, (syn. &quot;C. mossambicus&quot;) and long water snakes. In Uganda, lungfish and catfish were mainly fed to the young. Larger lungfish and catfish were taken in Malagarasi wetlands in western Tanzania. During this study, fish around were quite frequently taken and the largest fish caught by the shoebill was 99 cm long. Fish exceeding 60 cm were usually cut into sections and swallowed at intervals. The entire process from scooping to swallowing ranged from 2 to 30 minutes depending on prey size. However, these large prey are relatively hard to handle and often targeted by African fish eagle (&quot;Icthyophaga vocifer&quot;), which frequently steal large wading bird&#x27;s prey.

==Relationship to humans==
This species is considered to be one of the five most desirable birds in Africa by birdwatchers. They are docile with humans and show no threatening behavior. Researchers were able to observe a bird on its nest at a close distance – within . Shoebills are often kept in zoos, but breeding is rarely reported. Shoebills have bred successfully at Pairi Daiza in Belgium and at Tampa&#x27;s Lowry Park Zoo in Florida.

=== Appearances in popular culture ===
Beginning in 2014 and with various interspersed surges of attention since then, the shoebill has become the subject of internet memes, in part due to its intimidating appearance and its tendency to stand still for long periods of time. One such example is a video of a shoebill standing in the rain whilst staring into the camera. These memes have since also appeared on the social media platform TikTok, bringing a comparatively unknown species of bird into popular culture. The shoebill also inspired the design of the Loftwing birds in the 2011 game &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&quot;.

==Status and conservation==
The population is estimated at between and individuals, the majority of which live in swamps in South Sudan, Uganda, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia. There is also a viable population in the Malagarasi wetlands in Tanzania. BirdLife International has classified it as Vulnerable with the main threats being habitat destruction, disturbance and hunting. The bird is listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Habitat destruction and degradation, hunting, disturbance and illegal capture are all contributing factors to the decline of this species. Agriculture cultivation and pasture for cattle have also caused significant habitat loss. Indigenous communities that surround Shoebill habitats capture their eggs and chicks for human consumption and for trade. Frequent fires in southern Sudan and deliberate fires for grazing access contribute to habitat loss. Some swamps in Sudan are being drained for construction of a canal to control nearby waterways, causing more habitat loss.

<doc id="208208" wikidata="Q1248395" url="?curid=208208" title="Sanford and Son">
<text>Sanford and Son is an American sitcom television series that aired on NBC from January 14, 1972, to March 25, 1977. It was based on the British sitcom &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, which initially aired on BBC1 in the United Kingdom from 1962 to 1974.

Known for its racial humor, running gags, and catchphrases, the series was adapted by Norman Lear and considered NBC&#x27;s response to CBS&#x27; &quot;All in the Family&quot;. &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; has been hailed as the precursor to many other black American sitcoms. It was a hit through its six-season run, finishing in the Nielsen top ten five times.

The series follows Fred G. Sanford, known for his bigotry and cantankerousness, and Lamont Sanford, his long-suffering, conscientious, peacemaker son. Both characters are occasionally involved in get-rich-quick schemes to pay off their various debts.

The show also includes characters Aunt Esther, Grady Wilson, Bubba Bexley, Rollo Lawson, Donna Harris, and Julio Fuentes.

==Plot==

&quot;Sanford and Son&quot; stars Redd Foxx as Fred G. Sanford, a widower and junk dealer living at 9114 South Central Avenue in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, and Demond Wilson as his son Lamont Sanford. In the show, Fred moved to South Central Los Angeles from his hometown St. Louis during his youth.

After the show premiered in 1972, newspapers touted Foxx as NBC&#x27;s answer to Archie Bunker, the bigoted white protagonist of &quot;All in the Family&quot;. Both shows were adapted by Norman Lear from BBC programmes. &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; was adapted from &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; and &quot;All in the Family&quot; from &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;.

An earlier pilot for an American version of &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; was produced by Joseph E. Levine in 1965. It starred Lee Tracy and Aldo Ray as Albert and Harold Steptoe. This version was unscreened and did not lead to a series. The pilot was released on DVD in the UK in 2018.

==Episodes==

==Reception and cancellation==
&quot;Sanford and Son&quot; was enormously popular during most of its run and was one of the top 10 highest-rated series on American television from its first season (1972) through the 1975–76 season.

&quot;Sanford and Son&quot; put enough of a dent into the audience of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; to drive it off the air in 1974. &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; peaked at No. 2 in the Nielsen ratings during the 1972–73 season and the 1974–75 season, and the series was second only to &quot;All in the Family&quot; in ratings during those years. By the 1974–75 season, &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; lead-in helped the entire NBC Friday night lineup place in the coveted bracket of the Top 15 shows (&quot;Chico and the Man&quot;, following &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; at 8:30 p.m., ranked No. 3 for the season, while the police dramas &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; and &quot;Police Woman&quot;, which aired later in the evening, ranked at No. 12 and No. 15, respectively).

The show&#x27;s ratings dipped substantially in its final season, though it was still quite popular at the time of its cancellation.

In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the show on its list of the &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All Time&quot;.

===Ratings===
&quot;Sanford and Son&quot; was a ratings hit through its six-season run on NBC. Despite airing in the so-called Friday night death slot, it managed to peak at No. 2 in the ratings (behind &quot;All in the Family&quot;, and ranked less than one ratings point behind &quot;All in the Family&quot; during the 1974–75 season).

==Production notes==
The series was produced by Norman Lear&#x27;s and Bud Yorkin&#x27;s Tandem Productions, which was also responsible for &quot;All in the Family&quot;. The two shows were both based on popular British sitcoms and both were pioneers of edgy, racial humor that reflected the changing politics of the time. Both series also featured outspoken, working-class protagonists with overt prejudices. However, &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; differed from &quot;All in the Family&quot; and other Norman Lear shows of the era in that it lacked the element of drama. &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; helped to redefine the genre of black situation comedy.

Because of Lear&#x27;s commitments to his other concurrent series, and the distance between NBC Studios in Burbank where &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; were taped and the Hollywood locations of other Tandem shows, such as &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;Maude&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, and &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, which were recorded at CBS Television City or Metromedia Square, he did not have as much day-to-day involvement with &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; as with the other Tandem series, leaving the show-running to Yorkin.

While taping episodes for the 1973–74 season, Redd Foxx walked off the show in a salary dispute, though he cited health issues. His character was written out of the series for the remaining six episodes of the season, and it was explained that Fred Sanford was away in St. Louis attending his cousin&#x27;s funeral, with friend Grady (Whitman Mayo) in charge of the home. Foxx, who had been earning $19,000 per episode, , sought a 25% ownership stake in the series. Tandem Productions fought back with a $10 million lawsuit. The dispute was resolved in June 1974, with Foxx receiving $25,000, , per episode, to equal Carroll O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;All in the Family&quot; pay, plus 25% of the producers&#x27; net profits.

Although Foxx was still absent for production of the first three shows of Season 4, NBC aired his return as the season premiere and delayed showing the previously taped episodes. In 1977, rival network ABC lured Foxx away with a large sum to host his variety show, &quot;The Redd Foxx Comedy Hour&quot;, ending &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, which had been gradually declining in the ratings. The media reported that the dispute between Foxx and NBC was over the lack of a dressing-room window.

An exterior shot of the NBC Burbank lot was featured in the Season 5 episode &quot;Steinberg and Son&quot;. The storefront, seen only in the opening credits, stood at 10659 West Magnolia Boulevard in North Hollywood, nearly 16 miles from the Sanfords&#x27; fictitious 9114 South Central Avenue address in Watts. This same storefront, minus the &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; sign, can also be seen in &quot;Emergency!&quot; in a 1973 episode titled &quot;Alley Cat&quot;.

The pickup truck depicted in the series is a 1951 Ford F1. It was purchased at auction after the series ended and was later leased back to NBC for the spin-off shows &quot;Sanford Arms&quot; and &quot;Sanford&quot;. It has changed hands a few times over the years, eventually purchased by a real-life junk dealer, Donald Dimmitt of Dimmitt&#x27;s Auto Salvage, in Argos, Indiana. In 2014, the truck was purchased from Dimmitt&#x27;s by Tim Franko and Jeff Canter, owners of BlueLine Classics, a classic car dealership in North Royalton, Ohio, who restored the truck to its true condition as seen on the TV series and currently display it in the dealership&#x27;s showroom. It has since been on display in locations within Cleveland.

===Theme music===
Titled &quot;The Streetbeater&quot;, the theme music was composed by Quincy Jones through A&amp;M Records and released on record in 1973. Although the song did not reach &quot;Billboard&quot; status, it has maintained mainstream popularity and is featured on Jones&#x27; greatest-hits album. The song has been featured on series such as &quot;Scrubs&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

==Daytime reruns==
The series was rebroadcast on NBC from June 14, 1976 to July 21, 1978.

==Legacy==
After the series was canceled in 1977, a short-lived continuation featuring the supporting characters titled &quot;Sanford Arms&quot; aired. Whitman Mayo starred in a short-lived spin-off series, &quot;Grady&quot;, during the 1975–1976 season.

In 1980–1981, Foxx attempted to revive the show with another short-lived series titled &quot;Sanford&quot;, but Demond Wilson refused to reprise his role as Lamont Sanford for the new series.

==Home media==
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released all six seasons of &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; on Region 1 DVD between August 2002 and June 2005, with a &quot;Complete Series&quot; box set following in 2008.

<text>Joan Delano Aiken (4 September 1924 – 4 January 2004) was an English writer specialising in supernatural fiction and children&#x27;s alternative history novels. In 1999 she was awarded an MBE for her services to children&#x27;s literature. For &quot;The Whispering Mountain&quot;, published by Jonathan Cape in 1968, she won the Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize, a book award judged by a panel of British children&#x27;s writers, and she was a commended runner-up for the Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book by a British writer. She won an Edgar Allan Poe Award (1972) for &quot;Night Fall&quot;.

==Biography==
Aiken was born in Mermaid Street in Rye, Sussex, on 4 September 1924. Her father was the American Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Conrad Aiken (1889–1973). Her older brother was the writer and research chemist John Aiken (1913–1990), and her older sister was the writer Jane Aiken Hodge (1917–2009). Their mother, Canadian-born Jessie MacDonald (1889–1970), was a Master&#x27;s graduate from Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Jessie and Conrad&#x27;s marriage was dissolved in 1929, and Jessie married the English writer Martin Armstrong in 1930. Conrad Aiken went on to marry twice more. Together with her brother John and her sister Jane, Joan Aiken wrote &quot;Conrad Aiken Remembered&quot; (1989), a short appreciation of their father.

Aiken was taught at home by her mother until the age of twelve and from 1936 to 1940 at Wychwood School for girls in North Oxford. She did not attend university. Writing stories from an early age, she finished her first full-length novel when she was sixteen and had her first short story for adults accepted for publication when she was seventeen. In 1941 her first children&#x27;s story was broadcast on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;.

Aiken worked for the United Nations Information Centre (UNIC) in London between 1943 and 1949. In September 1945 she married Ronald George Brown, a journalist who was also working at UNIC. They had two children before he died in 1955.

After her husband&#x27;s death, Aiken joined the magazine &quot;Argosy&quot;, where she worked in various editorial capacities and, she later said, learned her trade as a writer. The magazine was one of many in which she published short stories between 1955 and 1960. During this time she also published her first two collections of children&#x27;s stories and began work on a children&#x27;s novel, initially titled &quot;Bonnie Green&quot;, which was later published in 1962 as &quot;The Wolves of Willoughby Chase&quot;. By then she was able to write full-time from home, producing two or three books a year for the rest of her life, mainly children&#x27;s books and thrillers, as well as many articles, introductions and talks on children&#x27;s literature and on the work of Jane Austen.

==Personal life and death==
Aiken married, secondly, to the New York landscape painter and teacher Julius Goldstein (died 2001) in 1976. They divided their time between her home (the Hermitage in Petworth, Sussex) and his native New York. In September 1999, she was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire. Aiken died at home at the age of 79 in 2004. She was survived by her two children.

== Writings ==
Aiken produced more than 100 books, including more than a dozen collections of fantasy stories, plays and poems, and modern and historical novels for adults and children. She was a lifelong fan of ghost stories, particularly those of M. R. James, Fitz James O&#x27;Brien and Nugent Barker. As well as writing under her own name, she used the pen name Nicholas Dee for several short stories. Some of her books focus on spine-chilling or supernatural events, including &quot;The Windscreen Weepers&quot; (stories, 1969), &quot;The Shadow Guests&quot; (novel, 1980), &quot;A Whisper in the Night&quot; (stories, 1982), and &quot;A Creepy Company&quot; (stories, 1993, with variant contents in its US and UK editions). She set her adult supernatural novel &quot;The Haunting of Lamb House&quot; at Lamb House in Rye (now a National Trust property). This ghost story recounts in fictional form an alleged haunting experienced by two former residents of the house, Henry James and E. F. Benson, both of whom also wrote ghost stories.

Many of Aiken&#x27;s most popular books, including the Wolves Chronicles (also known as &quot;The Wolves of Willoughby Chase&quot; series or the James III series), are set in an elaborate alternative history of Britain in which James II was never deposed in the Glorious Revolution, but supporters of the House of Hanover continually agitate against the monarchy. These books also toy with the geography of London, adding a Canal District among other features. Wolves have invaded the country from Europe via the newly built Channel Tunnel. The novels share a varying cast and a variety of interlinked child protagonists—initially Bonnie Green, but subsequently her itinerant friend Simon, Simon&#x27;s intrepid Cockney friend Dido Twite (the heroine of most of the books), Dido&#x27;s half-sister Is and Owen Hughes (son of Dido&#x27;s Royal Navy ally Captain Hughes). In a review of &quot;Midwinter Nightingale&quot; for the &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, Susan Patron praised the characterisations and the suspenseful plot and noted that &quot;although the titles in the &#x27;Wolves&#x27; series may be read independently&quot;, readers may want to read the earlier books first.

Aiken&#x27;s series of children&#x27;s books about Arabel and Mortimer were illustrated by Quentin Blake. Others were illustrated by Jan Pieńkowski and Pat Marriott. Pieńkowski won the foremost British award for children&#x27;s book illustration, the Greenaway Medal, for &quot;The Kingdom Under the Sea and Other Stories&quot; (Jonathan Cape, 1971), a collection of &quot;unique fairy tales from Eastern Europe and Russia&quot; retold by Aiken. She participated in the Puffin Book Club&#x27;s annual Children&#x27;s Literature Summer Camp, run by Colony Holidays, predecessor to ATE Superweeks, along with other popular children&#x27;s authors such as Ian Serraillier and Clive King. Her novels for adults include several that continue or complement novels by Jane Austen. These include &quot;Mansfield Revisited&quot; and &quot;Jane Fairfax&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
Two of Joan Aiken&#x27;s stories from her 1968 collection &quot;A Necklace of Raindrops&quot; were adapted into animated short films by director Tatyana Mititella at Soyuzmultfilm studio in the Soviet Union:
* &quot;A Rainy Day&quot; (Дождливая история, 1988), adapts &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Cat&quot; and is set to Paul Whiteman&#x27;s 1928 song &quot;Chiquita&quot; and other jazz standards
* &quot;Apple Pie&quot; (Яблочный пирог, 1991), adapts &quot;There&#x27;s Some Sky in This Pie&quot; and also features jazz music

== Selected works ==
===&quot;Wolves Chronicles&quot;===
The &quot;Wolves Chronicles&quot; vary in length from less than 150 pages to more than 250 pages. Here the novels are listed in narrative order, and their central characters.

====Main series====
* &quot;The Whispering Mountain&quot; (1968), a prequel to the series
* &quot;The Wolves of Willoughby Chase&quot; (featuring Bonnie Green, Sylvia Green and Simon) (1962)
* &quot;Black Hearts in Battersea&quot; (featuring Dido Twite and Simon) (1964)
* &quot;Nightbirds on Nantucket&quot; (Dido Twite) (1966)
* &quot;The Stolen Lake&quot; (Dido Twite) (1981)
* &quot;Limbo Lodge&quot; (U.S. title: &quot;Dangerous Games&quot;) (Dido Twite) (1999)
* &quot;The Cuckoo Tree&quot; (Dido Twite) (1971)
* &quot;Dido and Pa&quot; (featuring Dido and Is Twite) (1986)
* &quot;Is&quot; (U.S. title: &quot;Is Underground&quot;) (Is Twite) (1992)
* &quot;Cold Shoulder Road&quot; (Is Twite) (1995)
* &quot;Midwinter Nightingale&quot; (featuring Dido Twite and Simon) (2003)
* &quot;The Witch of Clatteringshaws&quot; (featuring Dido Twite and Simon) (2005)

====Related novels====
* &quot;Midnight Is a Place&quot; (1976)

This novel evidently takes place in the same fictional world as the series. Blastburn, the fictional setting of this work, features as the location of Mrs. Brisket&#x27;s orphanage in &quot;The Wolves of Willoughby Chase&quot;, but does not otherwise bring elements of the other books. Its setting and time period resemble and satirise the height of the Victorian manufacturing years, rather than the Georgian setting of the other books. &quot;Joan Aiken follows all the conventions of Dickensian fiction with just a little extra to satisfy jaded contemporary tastes. The Grimsby mansion at Midnight Court houses not one, but two unjustly disinherited orphans ...&quot;.

<text>In electronics and particularly computing, a jumper is a short length of conductor used to close, open or bypass part of an electronic circuit. They are typically used to set up or configure printed circuit boards, such as the motherboards of computers. The process of setting a jumper is often called strapping.

A strapping option is a hardware configuration setting usually sensed only during power-up or bootstrapping of a device (or even a single chip).

== Design ==
Jumper pins (points to be connected by the jumper) are arranged in groups called &quot;jumper blocks&quot;, each group having at least one pair of contact points. An appropriately sized conductive sleeve itself called a jumper, or more technically, a shunt jumper, is slipped over the pins to complete the circuit.

A two-pin jumper only allows to choose between two Boolean states, whereas a three-pin jumper allows to select between three states.

Jumpers must be electrically conducting; they are usually encased in a non-conductive block of plastic for convenience. This also avoids the risk that an unshielded jumper will accidentally short out something critical (particularly if it is dropped on a live circuit).

Jumper shunts can be categorized by their pitch (uniform distance between pins measured from center to center). Some common pitches are:
* 

== Use ==

When a jumper is placed over two or more jumper pins, an electrical connection is made between them, and the equipment is thus instructed to activate certain settings accordingly. For example, with older PC systems, CPU speed and voltage settings were often made by setting jumpers.

Some documentation may refer to setting the jumpers to on, off, closed, or open. When a jumper is on or covering at least two pins it is a closed jumper, when a jumper is off, is covering only one pin, or the pins have no jumper it is an open jumper.

Jumperless designs have the advantage that they are usually fast and easy to set up, often require little technical knowledge, and can be adjusted without having physical access to the circuit board. With PCs, the most common use of jumpers is in setting the operating mode for ATA drives (master, slave, or cable select), though this use declined with the rise of SATA drives and Plug and Play devices. Jumpers have been used since the beginning of printed circuit boards.

== Permanent parts of a circuit ==
Some printed wiring assemblies, particularly those using single-layer circuit boards, include short lengths of wire soldered between pairs of points. These wires are called &quot;wire bridges&quot; or jumpers, but unlike jumpers used for configuration settings, they are intended to permanently connect the points in question. They are used to solve layout issues of the printed wiring, providing connections that would otherwise require awkward (or in some cases, impossible) routing of the conductive traces. In some cases a resistor of 0 ohms is used instead of a wire, as these may be installed by the same robotic assembly machines that install real resistors and other components.

Jumpers setting configuration options not normally meant to be user-configurable can also be implemented as solder jumpers, typically two (or more) pads positioned closely together or even with interwoven shapes. Typically non-conductive by default they can be easily changed into a closed connection due to deliberately placed solder bridge on top of them. If the closed state is the default state, the PCB designer can superimpose a thin trace, which would be cut (with a knife) to open the jumper.

<text>Geochronology is the science of determining the age of rocks, fossils, and sediments using signatures inherent in the rocks themselves. Absolute geochronology can be accomplished through radioactive isotopes, whereas relative geochronology is provided by tools such as paleomagnetism and stable isotope ratios. By combining multiple geochronological (and biostratigraphic) indicators the precision of the recovered age can be improved.

Geochronology is different in application from biostratigraphy, which is the science of assigning sedimentary rocks to a known geological period via describing, cataloging and comparing fossil floral and faunal assemblages. Biostratigraphy does not &quot;directly&quot; provide an absolute age determination of a rock, but merely places it within an &quot;interval&quot; of time at which that fossil assemblage is known to have coexisted. Both disciplines work together hand in hand, however, to the point where they share the same system of naming strata (rock layers) and the time spans utilized to classify sublayers within a stratum.

The science of geochronology is the prime tool used in the discipline of chronostratigraphy, which attempts to derive absolute age dates for all fossil assemblages and determine the geologic history of the Earth and extraterrestrial bodies.

== Dating methods ==
=== Radiometric dating ===

By measuring the amount of radioactive decay of a radioactive isotope with a known half-life, geologists can establish the absolute age of the parent material. A number of radioactive isotopes are used for this purpose, and depending on the rate of decay, are used for dating different geological periods. More slowly decaying isotopes are useful for longer periods of time, but less accurate in absolute years. With the exception of the radiocarbon method, most of these techniques are actually based on measuring an increase in the abundance of a radiogenic isotope, which is the decay-product of the radioactive parent isotope. Two or more radiometric methods can be used in concert to achieve more robust results. Most radiometric methods are suitable for geological time only, but some such as the radiocarbon method and the 40Ar/39Ar dating method can be extended into the time of early human life and into recorded history.

Some of the commonly used techniques are:
* Radiocarbon dating. This technique measures the decay of carbon-14 in organic material and can be best applied to samples younger than about 60,000 years.
* Uranium–lead dating. This technique measures the ratio of two lead isotopes (lead-206 and lead-207) to the amount of uranium in a mineral or rock. Often applied to the trace mineral zircon in igneous rocks, this method is one of the two most commonly used (along with argon–argon dating) for geologic dating. Monazite geochronology is another example of U–Pb dating, employed for dating metamorphism in particular. Uranium–lead dating is applied to samples older than about 1 million years.
* Uranium–thorium dating. This technique is used to date speleothems, corals, carbonates, and fossil bones. Its range is from a few years to about 700,000 years.
* Potassium–argon dating and argon–argon dating. These techniques date metamorphic, igneous and volcanic rocks. They are also used to date volcanic ash layers within or overlying paleoanthropologic sites. The younger limit of the argon–argon method is a few thousand years.
* Electron spin resonance (ESR) dating

=== Fission-track dating ===
=== Cosmogenic nuclide geochronology ===

A series of related techniques for determining the age at which a geomorphic surface was created (exposure dating), or at which formerly surficial materials were buried (burial dating). Exposure dating uses the concentration of exotic nuclides (e.g. 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl) produced by cosmic rays interacting with Earth materials as a proxy for the age at which a surface, such as an alluvial fan, was created. Burial dating uses the differential radioactive decay of 2 cosmogenic elements as a proxy for the age at which a sediment was screened by burial from further cosmic rays exposure.

=== Luminescence dating ===
Luminescence dating techniques observe &#x27;light&#x27; emitted from materials such as quartz, diamond, feldspar, and calcite. Many types of luminescence techniques are utilized in geology, including optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), cathodoluminescence (CL), and thermoluminescence (TL). Thermoluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence are used in archaeology to date &#x27;fired&#x27; objects such as pottery or cooking stones and can be used to observe sand migration.

=== Incremental dating ===

Incremental dating techniques allow the construction of year-by-year annual chronologies, which can be fixed (&quot;i.e.&quot; linked to the present day and thus calendar or sidereal time) or floating.
* Dendrochronology
* Ice cores
* Lichenometry
* Varves

=== Paleomagnetic dating ===
A sequence of paleomagnetic poles (usually called virtual geomagnetic poles), which are already well defined in age, constitutes an apparent polar wander path (APWP). Such a path is constructed for a large continental block. APWPs for different continents can be used as a reference for newly obtained poles for the rocks with unknown age. For paleomagnetic dating, it is suggested to use the APWP in order to date a pole obtained from rocks or sediments of unknown age by linking the paleopole to the nearest point on the APWP. Two methods of paleomagnetic dating have been suggested: (1) the angular method and (2) the rotation method. The first method is used for paleomagnetic dating of rocks inside of the same continental block. The second method is used for the folded areas where tectonic rotations are possible.

=== Magnetostratigraphy ===

Magnetostratigraphy determines age from the pattern of magnetic polarity zones in a series of bedded sedimentary and/or volcanic rocks by comparison to the magnetic polarity timescale. The polarity timescale has been previously determined by dating of seafloor magnetic anomalies, radiometrically dating volcanic rocks within magnetostratigraphic sections, and astronomically dating magnetostratigraphic sections.

=== Chemostratigraphy ===
Global trends in isotope compositions, particularly carbon-13 and strontium isotopes, can be used to correlate strata.

=== Correlation of marker horizons ===

Marker horizons are stratigraphic units of the same age and of such distinctive composition and appearance that, despite their presence in different geographic sites, there is certainty about their age-equivalence. Fossil faunal and floral assemblages, both marine and terrestrial, make for distinctive marker horizons. Tephrochronology is a method for geochemical correlation of unknown volcanic ash (tephra) to geochemically fingerprinted, dated tephra. Tephra is also often used as a dating tool in archaeology, since the dates of some eruptions are well-established.

== Geological hierarchy of chronological periodization ==
Geochronology, from largest to smallest:
# Eon
# Era
# Period
# Epoch
# Age
# Chron

== Differences from chronostratigraphy ==
It is important not to confuse geochronologic and chronostratigraphic units. Geochronological units are periods of time, thus it is correct to say that &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; lived during the Late Cretaceous Epoch. Chronostratigraphic units are geological material, so it is also correct to say that fossils of the genus &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; have been found in the Upper Cretaceous Series. In the same way, it is entirely possible to go and visit an Upper Cretaceous Series deposit – such as the Hell Creek deposit where the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; fossils were found – but it is naturally impossible to visit the Late Cretaceous Epoch as that is a period of time.

<text>Diacetylene (also known as butadiyne) is the organic compound with the formula C4H2. It is the simplest compound containing two triple bonds. It is first in the series of polyynes, which are of theoretical but not of practical interest.

==Occurrence==
Diacetylene has been identified in the atmosphere of Titan and in the protoplanetary nebula CRL 618 by its characteristic vibrational spectrum. It is proposed to arise by a reaction between acetylene and the ethynyl radical (C2H), which is produced when acetylene undergoes photolysis. This radical can in turn attack the triple bond in acetylene and react efficiently even at low temperatures. Diacetylene has also been detected on the Moon.

==Preparation==
This compound may be made by the dehydrohalogenation of 1,4-dichloro-2-butyne by potassium hydroxide (in alcoholic medium) at ~70°C:

The bis(trimethylsilyl)-protected derivative may be prepared by the Hay coupling of (trimethylsilyl)acetylene:

<text>Loxaulax is a genus of extinct mammal from the Lower Cretaceous of southern England. It was a member of the also extinct order Multituberculata, and lived alongside the dinosaurs. It lies within the suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot; and family Eobaataridae. The genus &quot;Loxaulax&quot; was named by Simpson G.G. in 1928 based on one species.

The holotype of &quot;Loxulax&quot; is known from a single molar. It is characterised by possessing &quot;outer cusps of lower molar shortened antero-posteriorly, subselenodont, four in number. Inner cusps three.&quot; (Simpson, 1928).

Fossil remains of the species &quot;Loxaulax valdensis&quot; consist of a tooth found in Valanginian (Lower Cretaceous) strata belong to the Wadhurst Clay Formation of the Cliff End bonebed in Hastings, England. More recently, &quot;Butler and Ford reported some IoW (Isle of Wight) Wealden mammal teeth several decades ago from the Wessex Formation. They identified one of the teeth as belonging to the multituberculate &quot;Loxaulax&quot; but weren&#x27;t sure about the others. Other IoW Wealden mammal teeth have been found since but have yet to be written up,&quot; (with thanks to Darren Naish).

Representatives from the Isle of Wight Museum say that sieving is underway at one fossil location. This suggests new mammal finds are not unlikely.

Fossil remains of the species &quot;Loxaulax herreroi&quot; were found in the Barremian-age Camarillas Formation of Galve, Spain.

<text>Sandvika () is the administrative centre of the municipality of Bærum in Norway. It was declared a city by the municipal council in Bærum on 4 June 2003.

Sandvika is situated approximately west of Oslo. It is the main transportation hub for Western Bærum, and has a combined bus and railway station. Sandvika is also one of the stops along the route of the Airport Express Train. Sandvika also has Scandinavia&#x27;s largest super mall, Sandvika Storsenter, with 190 stores and a total area of . On 13 March 2013, the previously pedestrianized main street was opened for car traffic and on-street parking.
Sandvika used to be home to the BI Norwegian Business School, which moved to new surroundings in Nydalen, Oslo in August 2005. The building was, after some refurbishing, converted into the home of Sandvika High School.

Another school in Sandvika is Norges Realfagsgymnas NRG (Norwegian school of maths and science), a combined secondary school and high school. It lies in Skytterdalen and offers education in maths and science.

The nearby island of Kalvøya is a place for recreation. The Boat Sport House is located on Kalvøya, and is used by Bærum KK and Bærum RK. It also hosted one of the best known Norwegian music festivals Kalvøyafestivalen.

A small islet in Sandviksbukta, outside Sandvika, is called Danmark. Danes who live in the area join every year on 5 June Denmark&#x27;s national day to celebrate. It has been debate on the Danish flag on &quot;Danmark&quot;, but currently it still is there.

Claude Monet visited in early 1895. During his stay he painted several views of the town and the surrounding landscape, with the mountain ridge Kolsås featuring in many of the paintings either in the background or as the primary subject. Perhaps the most well known of the paintings from this visit is &#x27;Sandviken Village in Snow&#x27; which features the Løkke bridge in the foreground with Kolsås in the background. The bridge still stands in Sandvika.

<text>William Harrison Ainsworth (4 February 18053 January 1882) was an English historical novelist born at King Street in Manchester. He trained as a lawyer, but the legal profession held no attraction for him. While completing his legal studies in London he met the publisher John Ebers, at that time manager of the King&#x27;s Theatre, Haymarket. Ebers introduced Ainsworth to literary and dramatic circles, and to his daughter, who became Ainsworth&#x27;s wife.

Ainsworth briefly tried the publishing business, but soon gave it up and devoted himself to journalism and literature. His first success as a writer came with &quot;Rookwood&quot; in 1834, which features Dick Turpin as its leading character. A stream of 39 novels followed, the last of which appeared in 1881. Ainsworth died in Reigate on 3 January 1882, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===

Ainsworth was born on 4 February 1805 in the family house at 21 King Street, Manchester, to Thomas Ainsworth, a prominent Manchester lawyer, and Ann (Harrison) Ainsworth, the daughter of the Rev. Ralph Harrison, the Unitarian minister at Manchester Cross Street Chapel. On 4 October 1806, Ainsworth&#x27;s brother, Thomas Gilbert Ainsworth, was born. Although the family home was eventually destroyed, it was a three-storey Georgian home in a well-to-do community. The area influenced Ainsworth with its historical and romantic atmosphere, which existed until the community was later replaced by commercial buildings. Besides the community, Ainsworth read romantic works as a child and enjoyed stories dealing with either adventure or supernatural themes. Of these, Dick Turpin was a favourite of Ainsworth. During his childhood, he adopted Jacobite ideas and held Tory ideas in addition to his Jacobite sympathies, even though his community was strict Whig and Nonconformist. During this time, Ainsworth began to write prolifically.

The Ainsworth family moved to Smedly Lane, north of Manchester in Cheetham Hill, during 1811. They kept the old residence in addition to the new, but resided in the new home most of the time. The surrounding hilly country was covered in woods, which allowed Ainsworth and his brother to act out various stories. When not playing, Ainsworth was tutored by his uncle, William Harrison. In March 1817, he was enrolled at Manchester Grammar School, which was described in his novel &quot;Mervyn Clitheroe&quot;. The work emphasised that his classical education was of good quality but was reinforced with strict discipline and corporal punishment. Ainsworth was a strong student and was popular among his fellow students. His school days were mixed; his time within the school and with his family was calm even though there were struggles within the Manchester community, the Peterloo massacre taking place in 1819. Ainsworth was connected to the event because his uncles joined in protest at the incident, but Ainsworth was able to avoid most of the political after-effects. During the time, he was able to pursue his own literary interests and even created his own little theatre within the family home at King Street. Along with his friends and brother, he created and acted in many plays throughout 1820.

During the 1820s, Ainsworth began to publish many of his works under the name &quot;Thomas Hall&quot;. The first work, a play called &quot;The Rivals&quot;, was published on 5 March 1821 in &quot;Arliss&#x27;s Pocket Magazine&quot;. Throughout 1821, the magazine printed seventeen other works of Ainsworth&#x27;s under the names &quot;Thomas Hall&quot;, &quot;H A&quot; or &quot;W A&quot;. The genre and forms of the work greatly varied, with one being a claim to have found plays of a 17th-century playwright &quot;William Aynesworthe&quot;, which ended up being his own works. This trick was later exposed. In December 1821, Ainsworth submitted his play &quot;Venice, or the Fall of the Foscaris&quot; to &quot;The Edinburgh Magazine&quot;. They printed large excerpts from the play before praising Ainsworth as a playwright as someone that rivalled even George Gordon Byron. During this time, Ainsworth was also contributing works to &quot;The European Magazine&quot; in addition to the other magazines, and they published many of his early stories. Eventually, he left Manchester Grammar School in 1822 while constantly contributing to magazines.

After leaving school, Ainsworth began to study for the law and worked under Alexander Kay. The two did not get along, and Ainsworth was accused of being lazy. Although Ainsworth did not want to pursue a legal career, his father pushed him into the field. Instead of working, Ainsworth spent his time reading literature at his home and various libraries, including the Chetham Library. He continued to work as an attorney in Manchester and spent his time when not working or reading at the John Shaw&#x27;s Club. By the end of 1822, Ainsworth was writing for &quot;The London Magazine&quot;, which allowed him to become close to Charles Lamb, to whom he sent poetry for Lamb&#x27;s response. After receiving a favourable reception for one set of works, Ainsworth had them published by John Arliss as &quot;Poems by Cheviot Ticheburn&quot;. He travelled some during 1822, and visited his childhood friend James Crossley in Edinburgh during August. There, Crossley introduced Ainsworth to William Blackwood, the owner of &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and, through Blackwood, he was introduced to many Scottish writers.

=== Early career ===
Besides Crossley, another close friend to Ainsworth was John Aston, a clerk who worked in his father&#x27;s legal firm. In 1823, Ainsworth and Crossley began to write many works together, including the first novel &quot;Sir John Chiverton&quot; that was based around Hulme Hall in Manchester. Ainsworth wrote to Thomas Campbell, editor of &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot;, about publishing the work: but Campbell lost the letter. At the request of Ainsworth, Crossley travelled to London to meet Campbell and discuss the matter before visiting in November. Although the novel was not yet published, in December 1823, Ainsworth was able to get G. and W. Whittaker to publish a collection of his stories as &quot;December Tales&quot;. During 1824, Ainsworth set about producing his own magazine, &quot;The Boeotian&quot;, which was first published on 20 March but ended after its sixth issue on 24 April.

Ainsworth&#x27;s father died on 20 June 1824 and Ainsworth became a senior in the law firm and began to focus on his legal studies. To this end he left for London at the end of 1824 to study under Jacob Phillips, a barrister at King&#x27;s Bench Walk. Ainsworth lived at Devereux Court, a place that had been favoured by Augustan writers. During his stay, he visited Lamb, but felt let down by the real Lamb. Ainsworth attended Lamb&#x27;s circle, and met many individuals including Henry Crabb Robinson and Mary Shelley. During the summer of 1825, Ainsworth returned on a trip to Manchester in order to meet Crossley before travelling to the Isle of Man. He continued to write, and a collection of his poems called &quot;The Works of Cheviot Tichburn, with the types of John Leigh&quot; was published. He also had two works published in &quot;The Literary Souvenir&quot;, a magazine published by John Ebers.

On 4 February 1826, Ainsworth came of age and on 8 February was made a solicitor of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench. During this time, he befriended Ebers, who also owned the Opera House, Haymarket. Ainsworth would constantly visit shows at the house, and he fell in love with Ebers&#x27;s daughter Fanny during his visits. The relationship with the Ebers family continued, and John published a pamphlet of Ainsworth&#x27;s called &quot;Considerations on the best means of affording Immediate Relief to the Operative Classes in the Manufacturing Districts&quot;. The work, addressed to Robert Peel, discussed the economic situation in Manchester along with the rest of Britain. By June, Ainsworth left politics and focused on poetry with the publication of &quot;Letters from Cokney Lands&quot;. While these were printed he continued to work on his novel &quot;Sir John Chiverton&quot; and sought to have it published.

The novel was published by Ebers in July 1826. Ebers became interested in Ainsworth&#x27;s novel early on and started to add discussions about it in &quot;The Literary Souvenir&quot; in order to promote the work. Although the work was jointly written and sometimes claimed by Aston as solely his, many of the reviews described the novel as Ainsworth&#x27;s alone. The novel also brought Ainsworth to the attention of historical novelist Walter Scott, who later wrote about the work in various articles; the two later met in 1828. During that year, J. G. Lockhartt published Scott&#x27;s private journals and instigated the notion that the novel was an imitation of Scott. &quot;Sir John Chiverton&quot; is neither a true historical novel nor is it a gothic novel. It was also seen by Ainsworth as an incomplete work and he later ignored it when creating his bibliography. The novel does serve as a precursor to Ainsworth&#x27;s first major novel, &quot;Rookwood&quot;.

Ainsworth&#x27;s relationship with the Ebers family grew, and he married Fanny on 11 October 1826 with little warning to his family or friends. Ebers promised to pay a dowry of 300 pounds, but the funds were never given and this caused a strain in the relationship between Ainsworth and his father-in-law. Ainsworth continued in Ebers&#x27;s circle and attended many social events. He was encouraged by Ebers to sell his partnership in the Ainsworth law firm along with starting a publishing business. Ainsworth followed this advice, and the business had early success. In 1827, Fanny gave birth to a girl who took her name. Soon after, Ebers went bankrupt and Ainsworth lost a large sum as a consequence. Ainsworth published a few popular works, including &quot;The French Cook&quot;, an annual magazine called &quot;Mayfair&quot;, and some others. By 1829, Ebers took over Ainsworth&#x27;s publishing business, and Fanny gave birth to another daughter, Emily, soon after. Ainsworth gave up on publishing and resumed working in law. When a third daughter, Anne, was born in 1830, Ainsworth&#x27;s family began to feel financially strained. Ainsworth returned to writing and he contributed to &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, but it is uncertain how many works were actually his. However, he was working on his novel &quot;Rookwood&quot;.

=== Career as a novelist ===
By 1829, Ainsworth was neither a lawyer nor a publisher; indeed he did not have any employment at all. He longed for his youthful days in Manchester and pondered writing another novel. By the summer, he had begun to travel. It was during this time that he began to develop the idea of &quot;Rookwood&quot;, and began searching for information on the subject. While researching for the novel in 1830, Ainsworth was living at Kensal Lodge. He worked on some theatrical pieces and spent the rest of his time working in the legal profession. He soon became friends with William Sergison, and the two travelled to Italy and Switzerland during that summer. During their travels, they visited the tomb of Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats, along with witnessing other notable scenes in the lives of the British Romantic poets. Sergison was also the owner of a residence in Sussex, upon which Ainsworth drew in his novel. After the two returned to London, Ainsworth began working for &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which was launched in 1830. The group included many famous literary figures of the day, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey, Thomas Carlyle, James Hogg and William Makepeace Thackeray. It was not until a visit to Chesterfield towards the end of 1831 that he was fully inspired to begin writing the novel, which he did self-confessedly &quot;in the bygone style of Mrs Radcliffe&quot;.

Although he began writing the novel, Ainsworth suffered from more of his father-in-law&#x27;s financial problems and was unable to resume work on it until 1833. During the autumn of that year he managed to complete large portions of the novel while staying in Sussex, near Sergison&#x27;s home. The novel was published in April 1834 by Richard Bentley and contained illustrations by George Cruikshank. After working five years in the legal profession, Ainsworth gave it up and dedicated himself to writing. &quot;Rookwood&quot; garnered wide critical and financial success, and pleased his associates at &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. He started to dress as a dandy, and he was introduced to the Salon of Margaret Power, Countess of Blessington. Her Salon was a group of men and literary women, and would include many others but many in London believed that Blessington had a damaged reputation. However, this did not stop Ainsworth from meeting many famous British authors from the Salon. While part of her circle, he wrote for her collection of stories called &quot;The Book of Beauty&quot;, published in 1835. Ainsworth continued in various literary circles, but his wife and daughters did not; he stayed in Kensal Lodge while they lived with Ebers. During this time, Ainsworth met Charles Dickens and introduced the young writer to the publisher John Macrone and the illustrator Cruikshank. Ainsworth also introduced Dickens to John Forster at Kensal Lodge, initiating a close friendship between the two.

From 1835 until 1838, Ainsworth and Dickens were close friends and often travelled together. &quot;Rookwood&quot; was published in multiple editions, with a fourth edition in 1836 including illustrations by Cruikshank, which started the working relationship between the two. In 1835, Ainsworth began writing another novel, called &quot;Crichton&quot;. He devoted much of his time to it to the point of not having time for many of his literary friends. Its publication was temporarily delayed while Ainsworth was searching for an illustrator, with Thackeray being a possible choice. However, Ainsworth felt the illustrations were unsatisfactory, so he switched to Daniel Maclise, who was also later dropped. Coinciding with the search for an illustrator and hurrying to complete the novel, Ainsworth was asked to write for the magazine &quot;The Lions of London&quot;, but could not find the time to work on both projects and so attempted to finish the novel. The situation changed after Macrone, the original intended publisher, died. Ainsworth turned to Bentley as a publisher. Ainsworth eventually published his third novel in 1837. A fifth edition of &quot;Rookwood&quot; appeared in 1837, and its success encouraged Ainsworth to work on another novel about a famous outlaw, the story of Jack Sheppard.

Ainsworth&#x27;s next novel, &quot;Jack Sheppard&quot;, was serially published in &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; (January 1839February 1840). Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; also ran in the magazine (February 1837April 1839). A controversy over these Newgate novels developed between the two men, culminating in Dickens&#x27; retirement from the magazine editorship. His departure made way for Ainsworth to replace him at the end of 1839. &quot;Jack Sheppard&quot; was published in a three volume edition by Bentley in October 1839, and eight different theatrical versions of the story were staged in autumn 1839. Ainsworth followed &quot;Jack Sheppard&quot; with two novels: &quot;Guy Fawkes&quot; and &quot;The Tower of London&quot;. Both ran through 1840, and Ainsworth celebrated the conclusion of &quot;The Tower of London&quot; with a large dinner party to celebrate the works.

With the 1840 novels finished, Ainsworth began to write &quot;Old St. Paul&#x27;s, A Tale of the Plague and the Fire&quot;. The work ran in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; from 3 January 1841 to 26 December 1841, which was an achievement as he became one of the first writers to have a work appear in a national paper in such a form. His next works, &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; and &quot;The Miser&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, appeared in 1842. The first mention of &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; comes in a letter to Crossley, 17 November 1841, in which Ainsworth admits to writing a novel about Windsor Castle and the events surrounding Henry VIII&#x27;s first and second marriages. &quot;The Miser&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was published first, starting with the creation of &quot;Ainsworth&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, an independent project that Ainsworth started after leaving &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;. To create the magazine, Ainsworth teamed with Cruikshank, who served as the illustrator. Cruikshank moved his efforts from his own magazine, &quot;The Omnibus&quot;, to the new magazine, and an advertisement for it appeared in December 1841, saying that the first issue would be published on 29 January 1842. The opening of the magazine was welcomed by contemporary members of the press, which only increased as the magazine proved to be successful. &quot;Ainsworth&#x27;s Magazine&quot; marked the height of his career.

=== &quot;Ainsworth&#x27;s Magazine&quot; ===
Ainsworth hoped to start publishing &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; in his magazine by April, but he was delayed when his mother died on 15 March 1842. John Forster wrote to Ainsworth to offer assistance in writing the novel, but there is no evidence that Ainsworth accepted. The work was soon finished and started appearing in the magazine by July 1842, where it ran until June 1843. George Cruikshank, illustrator for &quot;The Miser&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, took over as illustrator for &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; after the first one finished its run. A play version of &quot;The Miser&#x27;s Daughter&quot; by Edward Stirling appeared in October 1842, with another version by T. P. Taylor in November. During this time, Ainsworth had many well-known contributors to his magazine, including the wife of Robert Southey, Robert Bell, William Maginn in a posthumous publication, and others. By the end of 1843, Ainsworth had sold his stake in &quot;Ainsworth&#x27;s Magazine&quot; to John Mortimer while remaining as editor. The next work that Ainsworth included in his magazine was &quot;Saint James&#x27;s or the Court of Queen Anne, An Historical Romance&quot;, which ran from January 1844 until December 1844. The work was illustrated by Cruikshank, the last time that Ainsworth and Cruikshank collaborated on a novel.

In 1844, Ainsworth helped in the building of the monument to Walter Scott in Edinburgh. He spent his year visiting many people, including members of the British nobility. The popularity of his magazine decreased over that year due to a lack of quality works, except for a series by Leigh Hunt, &quot;A Jar of Honey from Mount Hybla&quot;. Even Ainsworth&#x27;s own work, &quot;St James&#x27;s&quot;, was damaged because it was written in haste. During this time, Ainsworth began one of his best novels, &quot;Auriol&quot;, but it was never finished. It was published in part between 1844 and 1845 as &quot;Revelations of London&quot;. Hablot Browne, using the name &quot;Phiz&quot;, illustrated the work and became the main illustrator for the magazine. The novel was being produced until Ainsworth and Mortimer fought in early 1845 and Ainsworth resigned as editor. Soon afterwards, Ainsworth bought &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot; and started asking contributors to &quot;Ainsworth&#x27;s Magazine&quot; to join him at the new periodical. He issued an advertisement saying that there would be contributors of &quot;high rank&quot;, which caused Thackeray to attack him in &quot;Punch&quot; for favouring the nobility. However, Thackeray later contributed to the magazine, along with others including Hunt, E V Keanley, G P R James, Horace Smith, and Edward Bulwer-Lytton. Ainsworth reprinted many of his own works in the magazine along with his own portrait, the latter provoking a mock portrait of the back of Ainsworth&#x27;s head in &quot;Punch&quot; as the only angle that Ainsworth had not yet published for the public.

In 1845, two of Ainsworth&#x27;s friends and contributors died, Laman Blanchard and Richard Barham. Later in the year, Ainsworth was able to regain control over &quot;Ainsworth&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and continued to republish many of his earlier works. He spent much of his time recruiting contributors to the two magazines, and published a new work in 1847, &quot;James the Second&quot; but claimed only to be the &quot;editor&quot; of the work. By 1847, he was able to purchase the copyright of many of his earlier works in order to reissue them. During this time, he was working on what would be his best novel, &quot;The Lancashire Witches&quot;. By the end of 1847, the plan of the novel was finished and the work was to be published in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

=== Later life ===
In April 1872, a version of &quot;The Miser&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, called &quot;Hilda&quot;, was produced for the Adelphi Theatre by Andrew Halliday. On 6 April 1872, Cruikshank submitted a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, claiming that he was upset about his name being left out of the credits for the play. Additionally, he claimed that the idea for the novel came from himself and not from Ainsworth. This provoked a controversy between the two.

== Style and success ==
His first success as a writer came with &quot;Rookwood&quot; in 1834, which features Dick Turpin as its leading character. In 1839 he published another novel featuring a highwayman, &quot;Jack Sheppard&quot;. From 1840 to 1842 he edited &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;, from 1842 to 1853, &quot;Ainsworth&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and subsequently &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot;.

His Lancashire novels cover altogether 400 years and include &quot;The Lancashire Witches&quot;, 1848, &quot;Mervyn Clitheroe&quot;, 1857, and &quot;The Leaguer of Lathom&quot;. &quot;Jack Sheppard&quot;, &quot;Guy Fawkes&quot;, 1841, &quot;Old St Paul&#x27;s&quot;, 1841, &quot;Windsor Castle&quot;, 1843, and &quot;The Lancashire Witches&quot; are regarded as his most successful novels. He was very popular in his lifetime (in the early decades of the twentieth century King George V was a keen reader of his novels) and his books sold in large numbers, but his reputation has not lasted well. As John William Cousin argues, he depends for his effects on striking situations and powerful descriptions, but has little humour or power of delineating character. S. T. Joshi has characterized his output as an &quot;appalling array of dreary and unreadable historical novels&quot;. E. F. Bleiler has praised &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; as &quot;the most enjoyable&quot; of Ainsworth&#x27;s novels. Bleiler also stated &quot;All in all, Ainsworth was not a great writer--his contemporaries included men and women who did things better--but he was a clean stylist and his work can be entertaining&quot;.

Historians have criticised the mingling of fact and fiction in his novels, noting that his romanticised treatment of Dick Turpin became rapidly accepted (popularly) as historical fact, while his novelisation of the 1612 Lancashire witch trials similarly distorted real events into a Gothic form.

== Legacy ==
Ainsworth was largely forgotten by critics after his death. In 1911, S. M. Ellis commented: &quot;It is certainly remarkable that, during the twenty-eight years which have elapsed since the death of William Harrison Ainsworth, no full record has been published of the exceptionally eventful career of one of the most picturesque personalities of the nineteenth century.&quot;

Ainsworth&#x27;s 1854 novel, &quot;The Flitch of Bacon&quot;, led to the modern revival of the flitch of bacon custom at Great Dunmow in Essex, whereby married couples who have lived together without strife are awarded a side of bacon. Ainsworth himself encouraged the revival by providing the prizes for the ceremony in 1855. The Dunmow Flitch Trials, in turn, were the basis for the 1952 film &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; starring Petula Clark. Ainsworth also appears as a character in the historical novel &quot;Shark Alley: The Memoirs of a Penny-a-Liner&quot; by Stephen Carver (2016), in which the Newgate Controversy is dramatized. Ainsworth is one of the protagonists of Zadie Smith&#x27;s 2023 novel &quot;The Fraud&quot;.

<text>Sinobaatar is a genus of extinct mammal from the Lower Cretaceous of China. It is categorized within the also extinct order Multituberculata and among these it belongs to the plagiaulacid lineage (a possible infraorder). &quot;Sinobaatar&quot; was a small herbivore during the Mesozoic era, commonly called &quot;the age of the dinosaurs&quot;. The genus was named by Hu Y. and Wang Y. in 2002. Three species have been described.

It has been found in Lower Cretaceous strata of the Yixian Formation in Liaoning, China. According to Hu &amp; Wang (2002),
&quot;[t]he dental features of &quot;Sinobaatar&quot; show again that eobaatarids are obviously intermediate between Late Jurassic multituberculates and the later forms&quot;.
Many Multituberculata are only known from teeth, but the type specimen of &quot;Sinobaatar&quot; is a reasonably complete skeleton.

A probable tyrannosauroid specimen GMV 2124 (also known as NGMC 2124), previously attributed to &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;, contained a jaw of &quot;Sinobaatar&quot; in its stomach region.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Sinobaatar&quot; is a Latin and Mongolian mixture of &quot;Sino–&quot; and &quot;Bataar&quot; (Baghatur) and means &quot;Chinese hero&quot;. The type species name is in honor of Lingyuan City.

<text>John the Ripper is a free password cracking software tool. Originally developed for the Unix operating system, it can run on fifteen different platforms (eleven of which are architecture-specific versions of Unix, DOS, Win32, BeOS, and OpenVMS). It is among the most frequently used password testing and breaking programs as it combines a number of password crackers into one package, automatically detects password hash types, and includes a customizable cracker. It can be run against various encrypted password formats including several crypt password hash types most commonly found on various Unix versions (based on DES, MD5, or Blowfish), Kerberos AFS, and Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 LM hash. Additional modules have extended its ability to include MD4-based password hashes and passwords stored in LDAP, MySQL, and others.

== Sample output ==
Here is a sample output in a Debian environment.
$ cat pass.txt

The first line is a command to expand the data stored in the file &quot;codice_1&quot;. The next line is the contents of the file, i.e. the user (codice_2) and the hash associated with that user (codice_3). The third line is the command for running John the Ripper utilizing the &quot;codice_4&quot; flag. &quot;codice_5&quot; is the name of a text file full of words the program will use against the hash, codice_1 makes another appearance as the file we want John to work on.

Then we see output from John working. Loaded 1 password hash — the one we saw with the &quot;cat&quot; command — and the type of hash John thinks it is (Traditional DES). We also see that the attempt required one guess at a time of 0 with a 100% guess rate.

== Attack types ==

One of the modes John can use is the dictionary attack. It takes text string samples (usually from a file, called a wordlist, containing words found in a dictionary or real passwords cracked before), encrypting it in the same format as the password being examined (including both the encryption algorithm and key), and comparing the output to the encrypted string. It can also perform a variety of alterations to the dictionary words and try these. Many of these alterations are also used in John&#x27;s single attack mode, which modifies an associated plaintext (such as a username with an encrypted password) and checks the variations against the hashes.

John also offers a brute force mode, dubbed &quot;incremental mode&quot;. In this type of attack, the program goes through all the possible plaintexts, hashing each one and then comparing it to the input hash. John uses character frequency tables to try plaintexts containing more frequently used characters first. This method is useful for cracking passwords that do not appear in dictionary wordlists, but it takes a long time to run.

In addition to wordlist mode and incremental mode, there is :

* Markov mode — uses research by Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov to create candidates
* Mask mode — uses a user-supplied pattern to create candidates
* &quot;Single crack&quot; mode — uses details like the user&#x27;s login name, full name, home directory name, et al. as candidates
* Subsets mode — generates candidates based on complexity, prioritising longer simple passwords over shorter complex ones
* Regex mode — an experimental mode that uses a user-supplied regular expression, similar to the aforementioned mask mode, to create candidates
* Mode stacking — utilises the mask or regex modes in combination with another mode

<text>Ingolstadt (; ) is an independent city on the Danube, in Upper Bavaria, with 142,308 inhabitants (as of December 31, 2023). Around half a million people live in the metropolitan area. Ingolstadt is the second largest city in Upper Bavaria after Munich and the fifth largest city in Bavaria after Munich, Nuremberg, Augsburg and Regensburg. The city passed the mark of 100,000 inhabitants in 1989 and has since been one of the major cities in Germany. After Regensburg, Ingolstadt is the second largest German city on the Danube.

The city was first mentioned in 806. In the late Middle Ages, the city was one of the capitals of the Bavarian duchies alongside Munich, Landshut and Straubing, which is reflected in the architecture. On March 13, 1472, Ingolstadt became the seat of the first university in Bavaria, which later distinguished itself as the center of the Counter-Reformation. The freethinking Illuminati order was also founded here in 1776. The city was also a Bavarian state fortress for more than 400 years. The historic old town has been preserved.

There are two colleges in the city. The place is one of the three regional centers in Bavaria. The city is mainly characterized by the manufacturing industry, such as automobile and mechanical engineering. The unemployment rate was 3.3% in February 2022.

==Geography==
Covering an urban area of , Ingolstadt is geographically Bavaria&#x27;s fourth-largest city after Munich, Nuremberg, and Augsburg. At its largest point, the city is about from east to west and from north to south about . The city boundary has a length of .

The city boundary is about away from the geographic centre of Bavaria in Kipfenberg. The old town is approximately above sea level and the highest point, located in the district of Pettenhofen, is . The lowest point of the Schutter confluence with the Danube is at above sea level. Ingolstadt uses Central European Time throughout Germany; the average time lag is 14 minutes.

The city is expanding at the northern and southern banks of the Danube in a wide, flat bowl. The Ingolstadt basin borders the Jura foothills, located south and to the north of the Donau-Isar-Hügelland. In the southwest is the Donaumoos, while in the east, the lowland forests of the Danube reach into the urban area. It is the second-largest hardwood floodplain on the Danube. The Sandrach, the former southern main branch of the Danube, partly forms the southern city border. In the north, the Schutter flows through from the west, reaching the Danube near the Altstadt.

==History and culture==
Ingolstadt was first mentioned in a document of Charlemagne on 6 February 806 as &quot;Ingoldes stat&quot;, the place of Ingold. , Ingolstadt was granted city status.

Ingolstadt was the capital of the Duchy of Bavaria-Ingolstadt between 1392 and 1447. Ingolstadt was then united with Bavaria-Landshut. Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria ordered the building of the New Castle as well as the Church of Our Lady (Münster zur Schönen Unseren Lieben Frau), also known as &quot;Upper Parish&quot; (Obere Pfarr), whose form was strongly influenced by French Gothic architecture.

In 1472, Louis IX, Duke of Bavaria founded the University of Ingolstadt, which became the Ludwig-Maximilians-University. In 1800 it was moved to Landshut and in 1826 eventually to Munich. The University of Ingolstadt was an influential defender of the Roman Catholic Church during the Reformation era, led by such notable scholars as Johann Eck.

Ingolstadt is where William IV, Duke of Bavaria wrote and signed the Bavarian Reinheitsgebot in 1516.

On 30 April 1632, the German field marshal Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly died at Ingolstadt during a Swedish siege of the city. The field marshal had been badly wounded in a previous engagement with the Swedes under King Gustavus Adolphus. Ingolstadt proved to be the first fortress in Germany that held out for the entire length of the Swedish siege, and the Swedes eventually withdrew.

Gustavus Adolphus&#x27; horse remains can be seen in the City Museum. The horse was shot from under the king by one of the cannons inside the fortress, a cannon known as &quot;The Fig&quot;. When the Swedes withdrew, the city preserved the remains of the king&#x27;s horse, eventually putting the on display. It has remained thus for almost 400 years. In 1748, Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Order of Illuminati, was born in Ingolstadt. After the French invasion in 1799, the fortress was demolished, and the university was relocated to Landshut.

Originally a fortress city, Ingolstadt is enclosed by a medieval defensive wall. The Bavarian fortress (1537–1930) now holds the museum of the Bavarian army. During World War I, future French president Charles de Gaulle was detained there as a prisoner of war. A sappers&#x27; drill ground lies next to the river. Two military air bases are located nearby, one used for testing aircraft. The long military tradition of the city is reflected in today&#x27;s civil and cultural life. Former &quot;off-limit&quot; military training areas have been converted into well-used public parks.

Adolf Scherzer composed the &quot;Bayerischen Defiliermarsch&quot;. Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; was set at the &quot;Ingolstädter Alte Anatomie&quot; (Old Anatomy Building), now a museum for medical history. Marieluise Fleißer set her play &quot;Pioneers in Ingolstadt&quot; (1928) in the city.

== Economy ==
In 1945, the car manufacturer Auto Union first arrived in the city. The company&#x27;s original factories in Chemnitz and Zwickau (both then in Soviet-controlled East Germany) were shattered during the war, and were seized by the Soviets as reparations. Auto Union executives initially started a spare parts operation in Ingolstadt in the immediate post-war period, with a view to relocating the entire company to the region. With the help of Marshall Plan aid, Auto Union was formally re-founded in Ingolstadt in 1949, ultimately evolving into the modern-era Audi company, after it was taken over by Volkswagen in 1964. Today, Audi is the region&#x27;s largest employer and now dominates the economy of the city.

==Cityscape==

===Main sights===
As one of five ducal residences of medieval Bavaria—besides Landshut, Munich, Straubing and Burghausen—the city of Ingolstadt features many Gothic buildings, such as the (&#x27;old ducal castle&#x27;, ) and the New Castle, which was built from 1418 onwards. The largest church is the Gothic hall church of Our Lady (Liebfrauenmunster), which was begun in 1425. The church was built to serve as a second parish church beside Saint Maurice as well as the burial place for Louis and his family and intended to be the official burial place for the future Dukes of Bavaria-Ingolstadt. Its peculiar and rare angle of footprint was emulated in the 20th century built Cathedral of Newark. Also, the churches of Saint Maurice (1235) and of the Gnadenthal and Franciscan monasteries date from the Gothic era. The Kreuztor (1385) is one of the remaining gates of the old city wall and to this day the key landmark of the city. The Gothic Old City Hall was constructed in the 14th century and later altered several times.

The Baroque era is represented by the Old Anatomy Building of the university (1723–1736, designed by Gabriel de Gabrieli) and the church St. Maria de Victoria, which was built by the Asam brothers (1732–1736). The church of the Augustinians of Johann Michael Fischer (1736) was completely destroyed in World War II.

Many buildings of the neo-classical fortification of Leo von Klenze have been preserved, such as the &quot;Reduit Tilly&quot; and the towers &quot;Baur&quot; and &quot;Triva&quot;.

As well as being the home of the headquarters of the car manufacturer Audi, the town is also home to Audi&#x27;s museum mobile, which is open to the public and presents historic exhibits and offers guided tours.

===Parks and natural areas===
Ingolstadt is a green city with numerous parks, green spaces and forests. The most prominent of these is the &quot;Glacis&quot;, formerly an open space in front of the city walls, now surrounding the historic city centre. It functions as a &quot;green belt&quot; and a buffer area between traffic, residential areas and schools. It is possible to traverse it using spacious paths for pedestrians and cyclists, with a good view of the site of the former fortifications, including a well-preserved section of the ditch. Spanning about of the Glacis is , the biggest park in the city. It contained the former and was the site of the Landesgartenschau in 1992. Klenzepark is south of the Danube river, opposite the Ingolstadt old town. In the warm seasons, about 100,000 visitors use the park every month, mostly young people. While about 75% of the park visitors come from Ingolstadt and the surrounding area, the remaining approximately 25% travel from more distant places.

The biggest forest in Ingolstadt is the Auwald (&quot;riverside forest&quot;, also called &quot;Schüttel&quot;). It is found on both the northern and southern banks of the Danube, and is one of the biggest well-preserved river forests in Germany, extending mainly from Neuburg to Ingolstadt with extensions to the city centre. The forest serves as a natural reserve, with parts containing unique vegetation or acting as a wildlife reserve.

The Danube river runs through Ingolstadt, flowing west to east. In the area of Ingolstadt, the Danube is between 80 and 100 metres wide and flows past Ingolstadt&#x27;s old town.

==Schools==

===Ingolstadt School of Management===
Ingolstadt is home to the Ingolstadt School of Management, which is the department of business administration and economics of the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt. In national rankings, the business school regularly scores among the top ten. The faculty maintains a large network of partner universities for international educational exchange.

The Ingolstadt School of management offers bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in business administration. Among the academic programs offered are also executive MBA and doctoral degrees.

===Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt===
Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (THI) is a university for technology, computer sciences and business administration. With approximately 6,000 students, it is the biggest educational institution in Ingolstadt.

Several scholarship programmes supported by companies such as Siemens and Conti Temic (Continental AG) provide gifted students with financial assistance during their studies. These students deepen their practical experience by working at these organizations.

THI offers several undergraduate and graduate programmes.

==Sports==

The sports life of the city is based on the 83 registered sports clubs. The biggest sports club is the MTV 1881 Ingolstadt, with over 3000 registered members in 16 branches. In total, the sports clubs in Ingolstadt have more than 41,000 members.

Ingolstadt is especially known for ice hockey and association football. ERC Ingolstadt, founded in 1964, plays in the German Ice Hockey League since the 2002–03 season. With the exception of its season of debut and 2007–08, the club has reached the national playoffs every year , and has reached the semi-finals three times. They won the German Ice Hockey League Championship in 2014.

The football club FC Ingolstadt 04 came into existence in 2004 after the merger of the football branches of MTV Ingolstadt and ESV Ingolstadt. In the 2007–08 season, it was promoted from the third-highest division at the time, Regionalliga Süd to 2. Bundesliga. In the 2008–09 season, it was relegated to the penultimate place, but was promoted again in 2010-11 and remained in 2. Bundesliga till 2015. In 2015, Ingolstadt won the 2. Bundesliga and were promoted to the country&#x27;s highest league, the Bundesliga. During their first season in the Bundesliga, Ingolstadt finished in 11th place. They were relegated to 2. Bundesliga by the end of the 2016–17 season.

==Literary references==
Ingolstadt is one of the many settings in Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Primarily, Victor Frankenstein attends university in Ingolstadt. It is also widely regarded as the place where the unnamed monster was created.

The Illuminati was founded in Ingolstadt and Shelley&#x27;s husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, was sympathetic to the radical group&#x27;s aim of freeing society from Christian influence. In 1810 as a student at Oxford he wrote to his friend Thomas Jefferson Hogg: “I burn with impatience for the moment of Xtianity’s dissolution” and signed off with the Illuminati&#x27;s catchphrase “Ecrasez l’imfame”.

The musical version of the novel, &quot;Frankenstein – A New Musical&quot; has many scenes set in Ingolstadt.

Ingolstadt is also a pivotal location in &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson.

The sixth scene of &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot; by &quot;Bertolt Brecht&quot; is set in Ingolstadt, when count Tilly died in 1632, during the &quot;Thirty Years&#x27; War&quot;.

Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#x27;s 1971 film Pioneers in Ingolstadt is set in the town.

&quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;The Post-Modern Prometheus&quot; makes a reference to the University of Ingolstadt. This was an allusion to &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, as the episode contained numerous Frankenstein references, and the full title of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is &quot;Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus&quot;.
