<text>Hatra (; (); ) was an ancient city in Upper Mesopotamia located in present-day eastern Nineveh Governorate in northern Iraq. The ruins of the city lie northwest of Baghdad and southwest of Mosul. It is considered the richest archaeological site from the Parthian Empire known to date.

Hatra was a strongly fortified caravan city and capital of the small Arab Kingdom of Hatra, located between the Roman and Parthian/Sasanian Empires. Hatra flourished in the 2nd century, and was destroyed and deserted in the 3rd century. Its ruins were discovered in the 19th century.

== Name ==
Hatra is known as () in Arabic. It is recorded as (, ) in Hatran Aramaic inscriptions, probably meaning &quot;enclosure, hedge, fence&quot;. In Syriac, it is usually recorded in the plural form &quot;Ḥaṭrē&quot;. In Roman works, it is recorded as Greek &quot;Átra&quot; and Latin &#x27; and &#x27;.

The temple of Shamash, was officially called &quot;Beit ʾElāhāʾ&quot; &quot;House of God&quot;, in Hatran Aramaic inscriptions The city was recorded as &quot;Enclosure of Shamash&quot; (&quot;ḥtrʾ d-šmš&quot; ) on a coin.

== History ==
There is no archeological information on the city before the Parthian period but settlement in the area likely dates back to at least the Seleucid period. Hatra flourished under the Parthians, during the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, as a religious and trading center. Later on, the city became the capital of possibly the first Arab Kingdom in the chain of Arab cities running from Hatra, in the northeast, via Palmyra, Baalbek and Petra, in the southwest. The region controlled from Hatra was the Kingdom of Hatra, a semi-autonomous buffer kingdom on the western limits of the Parthian Empire, governed by Arabian princes.

Hatra became an important fortified frontier city and played an important role in the Second Parthian War, withstanding repeated attacks by the Roman Empire. During the 2nd century CE the city repulsed sieges by both Trajan (116/117) and Septimius Severus (198/199). Hatra&#x27;s forces defeated the ascendant Sassanid Persians in 238 at the battle of Shahrazoor, but fell shortly after in 241 to the army of Sassanid king Shapur I and was destroyed. The traditional stories of the fall of Hatra tell of al-Nadirah, daughter of the King of Araba, who betrayed the city into the hands of Shapur as she fell in love with him. The story tells of how Shapur killed the king and married al-Nadirah, but later had her killed also after realizing her ingratitude towards her father.

Hatra was the best preserved and most informative example of ancient Arabian architecture. Its plan was circular, and was encircled by inner and outer walls nearly in diameter and supported by more than 160 towers. A temenos (τέμενος) surrounded the principal sacred buildings in the city&#x27;s centre. The temples covered some 1.2 hectares and were dominated by the Great Temple, an enormous structure with vaults and columns that once rose to 30 metres. The city was famed for its fusion of Greek, Mesopotamian, Canaanite, Aramean and Arabian pantheons, known in Aramaic as &quot;&quot; (&quot;House of God&quot;). The city had temples to Nergal (Assyrian-Babylonian and Akkadian), Hermes (Greek), Atargatis (Syro-Aramaean), Allat, Shamiyyah (Arabian), and Shamash (the Mesopotamian sun god). Other deities mentioned in the Hatran Aramaic inscriptions were the Aramaean Ba&#x27;al Shamayn, and the female deity known as Ashurbel, which was perhaps the assimilation of the two deities the Assyrian god Ashur and the Babylonian Bel—despite their being individually masculine.

== List of rulers ==
In inscriptions found at Hatra, several rulers are mentioned. Other rulers are sporadically mentioned by classical authors. The earlier rulers are titled &quot;mrjʾ&quot; (&quot;māryā&quot;, &quot;lord&quot;) and the later ones &quot;mlkʾ d-ʿrb&quot; (&quot;king of the Arabs&quot;; &quot;malkā&quot;, &quot;king&quot;).

==Art of Hatra==
According to John M. Rosenfield, the statuary of Hatra belong to the Parthian cultural sphere, with numerous similarities in terms of clothing, decorative elements or posture, which tend to be massive and frontal, with feet often splayed. The architecture of Hatra itself is generally seen as an example of Parthian architecture. Similarities can be seen with the Art of the Kushans as well, due either to direct cultural exchanges between the area of Mesopotamia and the Kushan Empire at that time, or from a common Parthian artistic background leading to similar types of representation.

== Modern Hatra ==

Hatra was used as the setting for the opening scene in the 1973 film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, and since 1985 has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The site was first surveyed by Walter Andrae of the German excavation team working in Assur from 1906 to 1911. But systematic excavations have been undertaken only from 1951 by Iraqi archeologists. From the 1980s, the Italian Archaeological Expedition, directed by R. Ricciardi Venco (University of Turin), made major discoveries at Hatra. The excavations were focused on an important house (&quot;Building A&quot;), located close to the Temenos, and on deep soundings in the Temenos central area. Now the Expedition is active in different projects regarding the preservation and development of the archaeological site. In 1990, a Polish expedition of the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw recorded and studied the city&#x27;s defense walls.

In 2004, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; stated &quot;Hatra&#x27;s finely preserved columns and statues make it one of the most impressive of Iraq&#x27;s archaeological sites&quot;

=== Restoration by Saddam Hussein ===

Saddam Hussein saw the site&#x27;s Mesopotamian history as reflecting glory on himself, and sought to restore the site, and others in Ninevah, Nimrud, Ashur and Babylon, as a symbol of Arab achievement, spending more than US$80 million in the first phase of restoration of Babylon. Saddam Hussein demanded that new bricks in the restoration use his name (in imitation of Nebuchadnezzar) and parts of one restored Hatra temple have Saddam&#x27;s name.

=== Partial destruction and looting by ISIL ===
Actions by the forces of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which occupied the area in mid-2014, were a major threat to Hatra. In early 2015 they announced their intention to destroy many artifacts, claiming that such &quot;graven images&quot; were un-Islamic, encouraged shirk (or polytheism), and could not be permitted to exist, despite the preservation of the site for 1,400 years by various Islamic regimes. ISIL militants pledged to destroy the remaining artifacts. Shortly thereafter, they released a video showing the destruction of some artifacts from Hatra. After the bulldozing of Nimrud on March 5, 2015, &quot;Hatra of course will be next&quot; said Abdulamir Hamdani, an Iraqi archaeologist from Stony Brook University. On March 7, Iraqi official sources reported ISIS had begun the demolishing the ruins of Hatra. A video released by ISIL during the next month showed the destruction of the monuments.

UNESCO and ISESCO issued a joint statement saying &quot;With this latest act of barbarism against Hatra, (the IS group) shows the contempt in which it holds the history and heritage of Arab people.&quot;

The pro-Iraqi government Popular Mobilization Forces captured the city on 26 April 2017. A spokeswoman for the militias stated that ISIL had destroyed the sculptures and engraved images of the site, but its walls and towers were still standing though contained holes and scratches received from ISIL bullets. PMF units also stated that the group had mined the site&#x27;s eastern gates, thus temporarily preventing any assessment of damage by archaeologists. It was reported on 1 May that the site had suffered less damage than feared earlier. A journalist of EFE had earlier reported finding many destroyed statues, burnt buildings as well as signs of looting. Layla Salih, head of antiquities for Nineveh Governorate, stated that most of the buildings were intact and the destruction didn&#x27;t compare with that of other archaeological sites of Iraq. A PMF commander also stated that the damage was relatively minor.

<text>In functional analysis, an F-space is a vector space formula_1 over the real or complex numbers together with a metric formula_2 such that
# Scalar multiplication in formula_1 is continuous with respect to formula_4 and the standard metric on formula_5 or formula_6
# Addition in formula_1 is continuous with respect to formula_8
# The metric is translation-invariant; that is, formula_9 for all formula_10
# The metric space formula_11 is complete.

The operation formula_12 is called an F-norm, although in general an F-norm is not required to be homogeneous. By translation-invariance, the metric is recoverable from the F-norm. Thus, a real or complex F-space is equivalently a real or complex vector space equipped with a complete F-norm.

Some authors use the term rather than , but usually the term &quot;Fréchet space&quot; is reserved for locally convex F-spaces. 
Some other authors use the term &quot;F-space&quot; as a synonym of &quot;Fréchet space&quot;, by which they mean a locally convex complete metrizable topological vector space. 
The metric may or may not necessarily be part of the structure on an F-space; many authors only require that such a space be metrizable in a manner that satisfies the above properties.

== Examples ==

All Banach spaces and Fréchet spaces are F-spaces. In particular, a Banach space is an F-space with an additional requirement that formula_13

The Lp spaces can be made into F-spaces for all formula_14 and for formula_15 they can be made into locally convex and thus Fréchet spaces and even Banach spaces.

=== Example 1 ===

formula_16 is an F-space. It admits no continuous seminorms and no continuous linear functionals — it has trivial dual space.

=== Example 2 ===

Let formula_17 be the space of all complex valued Taylor series
formula_18
on the unit disc formula_19 such that
formula_20
then for formula_21 formula_17 are F-spaces under the p-norm:
formula_23

In fact, formula_24 is a quasi-Banach algebra. Moreover, for any formula_25 with formula_26 the map formula_27 is a bounded linear (multiplicative functional) on formula_28

== Sufficient conditions ==

== Related properties ==

The open mapping theorem implies that if formula_29 are topologies on formula_1 that make both formula_31 and formula_32 into complete metrizable topological vector spaces (for example, Banach or Fréchet spaces) and if one topology is finer or coarser than the other then they must be equal (that is, if formula_33).

* A linear almost continuous map into an F-space whose graph is closed is continuous.
* A linear almost open map into an F-space whose graph is closed is necessarily an open map.
* A linear continuous almost open map from an F-space is necessarily an open map.
* A linear continuous almost open map from an F-space whose image is of the second category in the codomain is necessarily a surjective open map.

<doc id="200442" wikidata="Q1439830" url="?curid=200442" title="One pound coin">
<text>The British one pound (£1) coin is a denomination of sterling coinage. Its obverse has featured the profile of Charles III since 2024 and bears the Latin engraving CHARLES III D G REX () F D (), which means &#x27;Charles III, by the grace of God, King, Defender of the Faith&#x27;. 

The original, round £1 coin was introduced in 1983. It replaced the Bank of England £1 note, which ceased to be issued at the end of 1984 and was removed from circulation on 11 March 1988, though still redeemable at the bank&#x27;s offices, like all English banknotes. One-pound notes continue to be issued in Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, and by the Royal Bank of Scotland, but the pound coin is much more widely used. A new, dodecagonal (12-sided) design of coin was introduced on 28 March 2017 and both new and old versions of the one pound coin circulated together until the older design was withdrawn from circulation on 15 October 2017. After that date, the older coin could only be redeemed at banks, although some retailers announced they would continue to accept it for a limited time, and it remained in use in the Isle of Man.

The main purpose of redesigning the coin was to combat counterfeiting. As of March 2014 there were an estimated 1,553 million of the original nickel-brass coins in circulation, of which the Royal Mint estimated in 2014 that just over 3% were counterfeit. The new coin, in contrast, is bimetallic like the current £2 coin, and features an undisclosed hidden security feature called &quot;iSIS&quot; (Integrated Secure Identification Systems).

The current 12-sided pound coins are legal tender to any amount when offered in repayment of a debt; however, the coin&#x27;s legal tender status is not normally relevant for everyday transactions.

==Design==
To date, four different portraits of Elizabeth II have appeared on the obverse. For the first three of these, the inscription was , where 2013 is replaced by the year of minting. The fourth design, unveiled in March 2015, expanded the inscription slightly to . The 12-sided design, introduced in March 2017, reverted to 

In summary:

* In 1983 and 1984 the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Arnold Machin appeared on the obverse, in which the Queen wears the &quot;Girls of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; Tiara.
* Between 1985 and 1997 the portrait by Raphael Maklouf was used, in which the Queen wears the George IV State Diadem.
* Between 1998 and 2015 the portrait by Ian Rank-Broadley was used, again featuring the tiara, with a signature-mark below the portrait.
* In 2015 the portrait by Jody Clark was introduced, in which the Queen wears the George IV State Diadem, with a signature-mark below the portrait.

In August 2005 the Royal Mint launched a competition to find new reverse designs for all circulating coins apart from the £2 coin. The winner, announced in April 2008, was Matthew Dent, whose designs were gradually introduced into the circulating British coinage from mid-2008. The designs for the 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p coins depict sections of the Royal Shield that form the whole shield when placed together. The shield in its entirety was featured on the £1 coin. The coin&#x27;s obverse remained unchanged.

The design of the reverse of the original coin was changed each year from 1983 to 2008 to show, in turn, an emblem representing the UK, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and England, together with an appropriate edge inscription. This edge inscription could just as often be &quot;upside-down&quot; (when obverse is facing upward). From 2008, national-based designs were still minted, but alongside the new standard version and no longer in strict rotation. The inscription appeared on all reverse designs.

In common with non-commemorative £2 coins, the round £1 coin (except 2004–07 and the 2010–11 &quot;capital cities&quot; designs) had a mint mark: a small crosslet found on the milled edge that represents Llantrisant in South Wales, where the Royal Mint has been based since 1968.

The reverse of the new 12-sided, bimetallic pound coin, introduced on 28 March 2017, was chosen by a public design competition. The competition to design the reverse of this coin was opened in September 2014. It was won in March 2015 by 15-year-old David Pearce from Walsall, and unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne during his Budget announcement. The design features a rose, leek, thistle and shamrock bound by a crown.

In October 2023 the King Charles III one-pound coin was presented; the coin features bees.

==Mintage figures==

===Round coin===
Mintage figures below represent the number of coins of each date released &quot;for circulation&quot;. Mint sets have been produced since 1982; where mintages on or after that date indicate &#x27;none&#x27;, there are examples contained within those sets.
All years except 1998 and 1999 have been issued into circulation, although the number issued has varied enormously – 1983, 1984 and 1985 in particular had large mintages to facilitate the changeover from paper notes, while some years such as 1988 are only rarely seen (although 1988 is more noticeable as it has a unique reverse). Production since 1997 has been reduced as a result of the introduction of the circulating two pound coin.

The final round coins minted for 2016 and the 2015 Shield of the Royal Arms fifth portrait did not enter circulation, as they were only available through commemorative sets. These were the shield from the Royal Coat of Arms by Matthew Dent, and a design by Gregory Cameron, Bishop of St Asaph, of four heraldic beasts.

===12-sided coin===
==Counterfeiting==

During later years of the round pound&#x27;s use, Royal Mint surveys estimated the proportion of counterfeit £1 coins in circulation. This was estimated at 3.04% in 2013, a rise from 2.74%. The figure previously announced in 2012 was 2.86%, following the prolonged rise from 0.92% in 2002–2003 to 0.98% in 2004, 1.26% in 2005, 1.69% in 2006, 2.06% in 2007, 2.58% in 2008, 2.65% in 2009, 3.07% in 2010 and 3.09% in 2011. Figures were generally reported in the following year; in 2008 (as reported in 2009), the highest levels of counterfeits were in Northern Ireland (3.6%) and South East England and London (2.97%), with the lowest being in North West England. Coin testing companies estimated in 2009 that the actual figure was about twice the Mint&#x27;s estimate, suggesting that the Mint was underplaying the figures so as not to undermine confidence in the coin. It is illegal to pass on counterfeit currency knowingly; the official advice is to hand it in, with details of where received, to the police, who will retain it and investigate. One article suggested that &quot;given that fake coins are worthless, you will almost certainly be better off not even looking&quot;. The recipient also has recourse against the supplier in such cases.
Counterfeits are put into circulation by dishonest people, then circulated inadvertently by others who are unaware; in many cases banks do not check, and circulate counterfeits. In 2011 the BBC television programme &quot;Fake Britain&quot; withdrew 1,000 £1 coins from each of five major banks and found that each batch contained between 32 and 38 counterfeits; the Mint estimated that about 31 per 1,000 £1 coins were counterfeit. Some of the counterfeits were found by automated machinery, others could be detected only by expert visual inspection.

In July 2010, following speculation that the Royal Mint would have to consider replacing £1 coins with a new design because of the fakes, bookmakers Paddy Power offered odds of 6/4 (bet £4 to win £6, plus the £4 stake back; decimal odds of 2.5), that the £1 coin would be removed from circulation.
Some counterfeits were of poor quality, with obviously visible differences (less sharply defined, lacking intricate details, edge milling and markings visibly wrong). Many better counterfeits can be detected by comparing the orientation of the obverse and reverse—they should match in genuine modern UK coins, but very often did not in counterfeit round £1. The design on the reverse must be correct for the stamped year (e.g., a 1996 coin should have a Celtic cross). It was difficult to manufacture round pounds with properly-produced edges; the milling (grooves) was often incomplete or poor and the inscription (often &quot;DECUS ET TUTAMEN&quot;) sometimes poorly produced or in the wrong typeface. A shiny coin with less wear than its date suggests is also suspect, although it may be a genuine coin that has rarely been used.

Counterfeit coins are made by different processes including casting, stamping, electrotyping, and copying with a pantograph or spark erosion. In a 2009 survey, 99% of fake £1 coins found in cash centres were made of a nickel-brass, of which three fifths contained some lead and a fifth were of a very similar alloy to that used by the Royal Mint. The remaining 1% were made of simple copper-zinc brass, or lead or tin, or both. Those made of lead or tin may have a gold-coloured coating; counterfeits made of acrylic plastic containing metal powder to increase weight were occasionally found.

The final &#x27;round pounds&#x27; were minted in December 2015; the replacement, a new 12-sided design, was introduced in 2017, the earliest dated as 2016. The coin has a 12-edged shape, similar to the pre-decimal brass threepence coin; it has roughly the same size as the previous £1 coin, and is bi-metallic like most £2 coins. The new design is intended to make counterfeiting more difficult, and also has an undisclosed hidden security feature called &quot;iSIS&quot; (Integrated Secure Identification Systems), thought to be a code embedded in the top layer of metal on the obverse of the coin, visible only under a specific wavelength of ultraviolet light.

Current two-pound coins, being bi-metallic (excluding some rarely tendered commemorative issues), remain harder to counterfeit than the round pound was; such counterfeits would often easily seen to have wrong colours.

==Other pound coins that entered circulation==
While the round pound was operational, others that entered circulation, although not legal tender in the UK, were some £1 coins of British Crown Dependencies, Gibraltar and UK South Atlantic Overseas Territories. Most coins of these territories, in all denominations, were of the same size and composition as a UK equivalent and most bore the same portraits of the UK monarch. After the UK replaced its round pound coins, these territories did not rush to do so; Gibraltar and the Isle of Man continued to use their round pound coins as well as the new UK pound coins and the other territories withdrew their round pounds without replacing them.

==Further reading==
In &quot;Real Britannia&quot;, an April 1993 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Julian Barnes describes the meetings to choose the 1994–1997 reverse designs. This is reprinted in his book &quot;Letters from London&quot; as &quot;Britannia&#x27;s New Bra Size&quot;.

<doc id="200446" wikidata="Q16475" url="?curid=200446" title="Mats Wilander">
<text>Mats Arne Olof Wilander (; born 22 August 1964) is a Swedish former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 20 weeks, including as the year-end No. 1 in 1988. Wilander won 33 career singles titles, including seven majors (three each at the French Open and Australian Open, and one at the US Open), and seven career doubles titles, including a major in men&#x27;s doubles at Wimbledon.

Wilander&#x27;s breakthrough came suddenly and unexpectedly when he won the 1982 French Open at the age of 17. Wilander won his fourth major singles title at the age of 20, the youngest man in history to have achieved the feat. In 1988, he won three of the four singles majors to finish the year ranked as the world No. 1. Wilander also won eight Grand Prix Super Series titles (1983–88), the precursors to the current ATP Masters 1000 tournaments. He was also a driving force behind Sweden&#x27;s run of seven consecutive Davis Cup finals and three titles in the 1980s. Wilander is one of seven men to have won major singles titles on grass courts, hard courts, and clay courts since the feat became achievable in 1978 (when US Open was first played on hard courts). Wilander, Nadal, and Djokovic are the only men to have won at least two major singles titles on each of the three surfaces. Wilander retired from the sport in 1996.

In 1983, Wilander won the Jerring Award. In 2002, he was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

==Career==

===Juniors===
Born in Växjö, Sweden, Wilander first came to the tennis world&#x27;s attention when he won the French Open junior title, the European under-16 and under-18 championships, and the Orange Bowl under-16 event in Miami.

===1980–1988===
Wilander made his debut on the professional tour at the clay court tournament in Båstad, Sweden in 1980. In September 1981, he lost his only career match against Björn Borg, losing in the first round of the Geneva Open in straight sets.

Wilander surprised the tennis world at the 1982 French Open. As an unseeded player, he upset second seed Ivan Lendl in the fourth round, fifth seed Vitas Gerulaitis in the quarterfinals, fourth seed José Luis Clerc in the semifinals, and third seed Guillermo Vilas in a four-set final that lasted 4 hours and 47 minutes (the longest French singles final played up until that point) and was notable for its long rallies, the longest point taking 90 strokes. At the end of the semifinal against Clerc he requested replay of the match ball as he did not want to win the game due to a questionable referee decision. This was seen as an extraordinary display of fair play and garnered him the Pierre de Coubertin World Fair Play Trophy. He was the youngest ever male Grand Slam singles champion at 17 years, 9 months, a record since broken by Boris Becker and Michael Chang. In only his third entry in a Grand Slam tournament, Wilander also became the player who needed the fewest attempts to win one, a record since equaled by Gustavo Kuerten at the 1997 French Open. Wilander then lost in the fourth round at both Wimbledon, to Brian Teacher, and the US Open to Lendl. Wilander won three additional tournaments in 1982 and finished the year ranked no. 7. During that year, Wilander was awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal.

Wilander returned to the French Open in 1983, where he lost to Yannick Noah in the final, after defeating John McEnroe in a quarterfinal. He lost in the third round at Wimbledon to Roscoe Tanner and in the quarterfinals of the US Open to Lendl. Wilander won his second Grand Slam title later that year at the Australian Open, played on grass at Kooyong Stadium, where he defeated McEnroe in a semifinal and Lendl in the final. He won eight other tournaments in 1983, including two Grand Prix Championship Series titles, and finished the year ranked no. 4.

Wilander retained his Australian Open title in 1984, beating Stefan Edberg in the quarterfinals and Kevin Curren in the final. He lost in the semifinals of the French Open to Lendl, the second round at Wimbledon to Pat Cash, and the quarterfinals of the US Open to Cash. He won three tournaments in 1984 including his third Championships Series title and again finished the year ranked no. 4.

In 1985, Wilander won the French Open for the second time, beating Lendl in the final, and again reached the Australian Open final, where he lost to Edberg. However, he lost in the first round at Wimbledon to Slobodan Živojinović and the semifinals of the US Open to McEnroe. He won three tournaments in 1985 and finished the year ranked no. 3.

Wilander rose to the no. 2 ranking, behind Lendl, on 28 April 1986. He then lost in the third round of the French Open to Andrei Chesnokov, the fourth round of Wimbledon to Cash, and the fourth round of the US Open to Miloslav Mečíř. His consistency at other tournaments, however, allowed him to again finish the year ranked no. 3. Wilander partnered with countryman Joakim Nyström to win the men&#x27;s doubles title at Wimbledon in 1986. He also won his fourth Grand Prix Championship Series title.

The 1987 season saw Wilander unveil a more potent service and a new highly effective one-handed slice backhand, the latter a somewhat remarkable development for a mid-career top-level tennis professional. Despite the improvements, however, Wilander was defeated by Lendl in the finals of both the French Open and the US Open in 1987. Cash again proved to be Wilander&#x27;s nemesis at Wimbledon, winning their quarterfinal match in straight sets. Wilander won five tournaments in 1987 including two Grand Prix Tennis Championship Series titles and six overall, finishing the year ranked third in the world for the third consecutive year.

1988 was the pinnacle of Wilander&#x27;s career. In January, he won his third Australian Open singles title, this time on Melbourne Park&#x27;s hardcourts, defeating Edberg in a five-set semifinal and home town favourite Cash in a five-set final. In doing so, he became the only player to win the Australian Open on both grass and hardcourt. Wilander faced another home crowd favourite, Henri Leconte, in the final of the French Open. Wilander won in straight sets, missing only two out of 73 first serves in the entire match. At Wimbledon, Wilander reached the quarterfinals where he lost to Mečíř. At the US Open, he reached his third Grand Slam final of the year. In a repeat match-up of the previous year&#x27;s final, he defeated Lendl in five sets in 4 hours 54 minutes (the longest US Open singles final to that point) and ended Lendl&#x27;s three-year reign at the top of the world rankings. This was Wilander&#x27;s seventh Grand Slam singles title and resulted in his receiving the number one ranking, having won three of the year&#x27;s Grand Slam tournaments, two more Grand Prix Championship Series titles at Key Biscayne and Cincinnati, and one other title in Palermo. He held the top ranking for a total of 20 weeks until Lendl reclaimed it at the end of January 1989.

His 1988 title at Cincinnati was his fourth there, at the time making him one of only three players since 1899 to win four titles in Cincinnati, along with Bobby Riggs and George Lott. Roger Federer has since joined the list.

===1989–1996===
Wilander&#x27;s motivation, results, and ranking suffered in 1989. He lost in the second round of the Australian Open to Ramesh Krishnan, the quarterfinals of the French Open to Andrei Chesnokov, the quarterfinals of Wimbledon to John McEnroe, and the second round of the US Open to Pete Sampras. He did not win a tournament during 1989 and he finished the year ranked World No. 12.

Wilander briefly moved back into the top 10 rankings on 12 February 1990, but by the end of the year, his ranking had slumped to World No. 41. He defeated Boris Becker in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, only to lose to Stefan Edberg in straight sets in the semifinals. He skipped the French Open and Wimbledon and lost in the first round of the US Open to Brad Gilbert. He won the final singles title of his career at Itaparica.

Wilander played only the first half of 1991. He lost in the fourth round of the Australian Open and the second round of the French Open. He finished the year ranked world No. 159.

Wilander was absent from the tour in 1992. He played seven tournaments in 1993, losing in the first round of five of them. At the US Open, he lost in the third round to Cédric Pioline. He finished the year ranked World No. 330.

Except for Wimbledon, Wilander played a full schedule in 1994. He lost in the fourth round of the Australian Open to MaliVai Washington, the first round of the French Open to Andre Agassi in straight sets, and the first round of the US Open to Guy Forget. His only victory over a top ten player was in the second round of the tournament in Indianapolis against Todd Martin. He finished the year ranked World No. 129.

Wilander&#x27;s results improved slightly in 1995 as he finished the year ranked World No. 46. After losing in the first round of the Australian Open to Jacco Eltingh, he lost in the second round of the French Open to eighth ranked Wayne Ferreira. He then lost in the third round of Wimbledon to Eltingh and the second round of the US Open to Martin. At Canadian Open in Montreal, Wilander won his final tour match against Edberg, then beat eighth ranked Ferreira and sixth ranked Yevgeny Kafelnikov before losing to Agassi in the semis. At New Haven, Wilander beat 10th ranked Marc Rosset before losing to Agassi in the semis.

In 1996, Wilander reached the final of the Pinehurst ATP tournament in May, losing to Fernando Meligeni (it was Wilander&#x27;s first ATP tournament final since 1990). He played only one Grand Slam tournament, losing in the second round of the French Open to Martin. He retired from the tour after losing his final match to Martin Damm in Beijing in October.

During most of his career, Wilander used the Rossignol F-200 Carbon tennis racquet, an early fiberglass model.

====Failed drug test and suspension====
During the 1995 French Open he and Karel Nováček tested positive for cocaine. They appealed the initial three-month suspension by the International Tennis Federation, claiming flawed test procedures but withdrew their appeals in May 1997 and on 15 May 1997 received a three-month suspension from the ATP Tour for failing a drugs test. Additionally Wilander had to return his prize money since May 1995, amounting to $289,005, and forfeit ranking points.

===Davis Cup===
Wilander was an integral member of Sweden&#x27;s highly successful Davis Cup team throughout the 1980s.

He reached his first final with Sweden in 1983, which they lost 3–2 to Australia (despite Wilander winning both his singles rubbers in the final). In 1984, Sweden (with Wilander) won the cup, beating the United States 4–1 in the final. Sweden retained the cup in 1985, with a 3–2 final victory over West Germany. Wilander helped Sweden reach the final again in 1986 but declined to play in the final because he was getting married (Sweden lost 3–2 to Australia). Wilander played in his fourth final in 1987, where Sweden beat India 5–0. Two more finals followed in 1988 and 1989, but Sweden lost both to West Germany. Wilander last played in Davis Cup in the 1995 semifinals, where he lost to Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras.

Wilander compiled a 36–16 record in singles and a 7–2 record in doubles in the Davis Cup for Sweden. However, Wilander&#x27;s most memorable Davis Cup match came in defeat. In a July 1982 quarterfinal tie against the United States on carpet in St. Louis, Missouri, Wilander was defeated in the deciding fifth rubber by John McEnroe 9–7, 6–2, 15–17, 3–6, 8–6. At 6 hours and 32 minutes it remains the second longest singles match in Davis Cup history.

==Life after retirement from the pro-tour==
Wilander competes from time to time on the senior tour. Since retiring as a player, he has served as captain of the Swedish Davis Cup team. Wilander also serves as a commentator for tennis matches on Eurosport.

Wilander created a minor controversy during the 2006 French Open when he criticized several top players, including Roger Federer and Kim Clijsters, as lacking the competitive edge to beat their toughest rivals. After Federer&#x27;s 1–6, 6–1, 6–4, 7–6 loss to Nadal in the final, Wilander said that &quot;Federer, today, unfortunately came out with no balls... you don&#x27;t find too many champions in any sport in the world without heart or balls. He might have them, but against Nadal they shrank to a very small size and it&#x27;s not once, it&#x27;s every time.&quot;

In the aftermath of these comments, fans coined the neologism &quot;Wilanders&quot; as a humorous synonym for &quot;balls&quot;, denoting a competitive spirit and tenacity to win.

Wilander began coaching Tatiana Golovin in July 2007. After working with Golovin in the later part of 2007, Wilander began coaching Paul-Henri Mathieu.

==Personal life==
Wilander, who won $8 million as a pro and more in endorsements, now spends much of his time living on an 81-acre estate in Hailey, Idaho, United States (part of the Sun Valley ski resort) with his wife Sonya (née Mulholland), a South African-born model, whom he started dating in 1985 and married in 1987.

Wilander has four children, Emma, Karl, Erik, and Oskar. His son Erik suffers from a comparatively mild form of epidermolysis bullosa, which benefits from Idaho&#x27;s cool and dry air, and Wilander and his wife have worked to raise funds for research into cures for the disease.

His brother, , was Mayor of Tranås Municipality 2006–2020.

In 2012, Wilander won the International Club&#x27;s Jean Borotra Sportsmanship Award.

<text>Homer Norman Wallin (December 6, 1893 – March 6, 1984) was a vice admiral in the United States Navy, best known for his salvage of ships sunk in the attack on Pearl Harbor.

==Biography==
Wallin was born in Washburn, North Dakota. Following brief attendance at the University of North Dakota and a year in the state National Guard, he was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1913. He graduated in March 1917 and was commissioned in the rank of Ensign. During most of World War I, he served in the battleship . In September 1918, he was transferred to the navy&#x27;s Construction Corps and was sent to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for postgraduate education in naval architecture.

After receiving his Master of Science degree in 1921, Wallin served for four years at the New York Navy Yard. He was assigned to the Bureau of Construction and Repair in Washington, D.C., in 1925 to 1929. Over the following decade he had successive tours at the Mare Island and Philadelphia Navy Yards and at the Bureau of Construction and Repair (redesignated the Bureau of Ships in 1940). During this time, Wallin met and married his wife Elizabeth, and had two children, son Homer Norman, Jr. and daughter Susan Ann.

In 1941, Captain Wallin became material officer for commander, Battle Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, and was serving in that position when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Early in the following year, he was placed in charge of the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard&#x27;s Salvage Division. Through most of 1942, he directed the Pearl Harbor ship salvage effort, a huge task that enabled the navy to recover the use of three sunken battleships. From November 1942 to August 1943, he was force maintenance officer for the South Pacific Force, then spent a few months at the Bureau of Ships. Rear Admiral Wallin was supervisor of shipbuilding and inspector of ordnance at Seattle and commander of the naval station at Tacoma, Washington, beginning in October 1943.

==Post-World War II Career==

Because of his prior experience in salvaging the ships after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Wallin was selected to command the salvage effort of the 1950 USS &quot;Missouri&quot; grounding.

Following World War II, Wallin commanded the Philadelphia and Norfolk Naval Shipyards. In February 1951, he became chief of the Bureau of Ships, a post he held until August 1953, when he took command of the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. He retired from active service on 1 May 1955 and was simultaneously advanced to the rank of vice admiral on the basis of his combat awards.

In 1968, retired Vice Admiral Wallin published a memoir of his service, especially the Pearl Harbor salvage operations, titled &quot;Pearl Harbor: Why, How, Fleet Salvage and Final Appraisal&quot;.

Vice Admiral Homer N. Wallin died on 6 March 1984. He is interred at Willamette National Cemetery, Portland, Oregon.

<text>Ludlow Castle is a ruined medieval fortification in the town of the same name in the English county of Shropshire, standing on a promontory overlooking the River Teme. The castle was probably founded by Walter de Lacy after the Norman Conquest and was one of the first stone castles to be built in England. During the civil war of the 12th century the castle changed hands several times between the de Lacys and rival claimants, and was further fortified with a Great Tower and a large outer bailey. In the mid-13th century, Ludlow was passed on to Geoffrey de Geneville, who rebuilt part of the inner bailey, and the castle played a part in the Second Barons&#x27; War. Roger Mortimer acquired the castle in 1301, further extending the internal complex of buildings. Richard, Duke of York, inherited the castle in 1425, and it became an important symbol of Yorkist authority during the Wars of the Roses. When Richard&#x27;s son, Edward IV, seized the throne in 1461 it passed into the ownership of the Crown. Ludlow Castle was chosen as the seat of the Council of Wales and the Marches, effectively acting as the capital of Wales, and it was extensively renovated throughout the 16th century. By the 17th century the castle was luxuriously appointed, hosting cultural events such as the first performance of John Milton&#x27;s masque &quot;Comus&quot;. Ludlow Castle was held by the Royalists during the English Civil War of the 1640s, until it was besieged and taken by a Parliamentarian army in 1646. The contents of the castle were sold off and a garrison was retained there for much of the interregnum.

With the Restoration of 1660, the council was reestablished and the castle repaired, but Ludlow never recovered from the civil war years and when the council was finally abolished in 1689 it fell into neglect. Henry, 1st Earl of Powis, leased the property from the Crown in 1772, extensively landscaping the ruins, while his brother-in-law, Edward, 1st Earl of Powis (by the third creation of the Earldom of Powis), bought the castle outright in 1811. A mansion was constructed in the outer bailey but the remainder of the castle was left largely untouched, attracting an increasing number of visitors and becoming a popular location for artists. After 1900, Ludlow Castle was cleared of vegetation and over the course of the century it was extensively repaired by the Powis Estate and government bodies. In the 21st century it is still owned by the Earl of Powis and operated as a tourist attraction.

The architecture of Ludlow reflects its long history, retaining a blend of several styles of building. The castle is approximately in size, covering almost . The outer bailey includes the Castle House building, now used by the Powis Estate as offices and accommodation, while the inner bailey, separated by a trench cut out of the stone, houses the Great Tower, Solar block, Great Hall and Great Chamber block, along with later 16th-century additions, as well as a rare, circular chapel, modelled on the shrine in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

== History ==

=== 11th century ===

Ludlow Castle was probably founded by Walter de Lacy around 1075. Walter had arrived in England in 1066 as part of William fitzOsbern&#x27;s household during the Norman Conquest of England. FitzOsbern was made the Earl of Hereford and tasked with settling the area; at the same time, several castles were founded in the west of the county, securing its border with Wales. Walter de Lacy was the earl&#x27;s second in command, and was rewarded with 163 manors spread across seven counties, with 91 in Herefordshire alone.

Walter began building a castle within the manor of Stanton Lacy; the fortification was originally called Dinham Castle, before it acquired its later name of Ludlow. Ludlow was the most important of Walter&#x27;s castles: as well as being at the heart of his new estates, the site also lay at a strategic crossroads over the River Teme, on a strong defensive promontory. Walter died in a construction accident at Hereford in 1085 and was succeeded by his son, Roger de Lacy.

The castle&#x27;s Norman stone fortifications were added possibly as early as the 1080s onwards, and were finished before 1115, based around what is now the inner bailey of the castle, forming a stone version of a ringwork. It had four towers and a gatehouse tower along the walls, with a ditch dug out of the rock along two sides, the excavated stone being reused for the building works, and would have been one of the first masonry castles in England. With its circular design and grand entrance tower, it has been likened to the earlier Anglo-Saxon &quot;burgheat&quot; designs. In 1096, Roger was stripped of his lands after rebelling against William II and they were reassigned to Roger&#x27;s brother, Hugh.

=== 12th century ===

Hugh de Lacy died childless around 1115, and Henry I gave Ludlow Castle and most of the surrounding estates to Hugh&#x27;s niece, Sybil, marrying her to Pain fitzJohn, one of his household staff. Pain used Ludlow as his &quot;caput&quot;, the main castle in his estates, using the surrounding estates and knight&#x27;s fees to support the castle and its defences. Pain died in 1137 fighting the Welsh, triggering a struggle for the inheritance of the castle. Robert fitzMiles, who had been planning to marry Pain&#x27;s daughter, laid claim to it, as did Gilbert de Lacy, Roger de Lacy&#x27;s son. By now, King Stephen had seized the English throne, but his position was insecure and he therefore gave Ludlow to fitzMiles in 1137, in exchange for promises of future political support.

A civil war between Stephen and the Empress Matilda soon broke out and Gilbert took his chance to rise up against Stephen, seizing Ludlow Castle. Stephen responded by taking an army into the Welsh Marches, where he attempted to garner local support by marrying one of his knights, Joce de Dinan, to Sybil and granting the future ownership of the castle to them. Stephen took the castle after several attempts in 1139, famously rescuing his ally Prince Henry of Scotland when the latter was caught on a hook thrown over the walls by the garrison. Gilbert still maintained that he was the rightful owner of Ludlow, however, and a private war ensued between Joce and himself. Gilbert was ultimately successful and retook the castle around a few years before the end of the civil war in 1153. He ultimately left for the Levant, leaving Ludlow in the hands of firstly, his eldest son, Robert, and then, after Robert&#x27;s death, his younger son, Hugh de Lacy.

During this period, the Great Tower, a form of keep, was constructed by converting the entrance tower, probably either around the time of the siege of 1139, or during the war between Gilbert and Joce. The old Norman castle had also begun to become too small for a growing household and, probably between 1140 and 1177, an outer bailey was built to the south and east of the original castle, creating a large open space. In the process, the entrance to the castle shifted from the south to the east, to face the growing town of Ludlow. Gilbert probably built the circular chapel in the inner bailey, resembling the churches of the Templar order which he later joined.

Hugh took part in the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland and in 1172 was made Lord of Meath; he spent much time away from Ludlow, and Henry II confiscated the castle in his absence, probably to ensure that Hugh stayed loyal while in Ireland. Hugh died in Ireland in 1186 and the castle passed to his son, Walter, who was a minor and did not take charge of the property until 1194. During Prince John&#x27;s rebellion against Richard I in 1194, Walter joined in the attacks against the prince; Richard did not approve of this and confiscated Ludlow and Walter&#x27;s other properties. Walter de Lacy offered to buy back his land for 1,000 marks, but the offer was rejected until in 1198 the vast sum of 3,100 marks was finally agreed.

=== 13th century ===

Walter de Lacy travelled to Ireland in 1201 and the following year his properties, including Ludlow Castle, were once again confiscated to ensure his loyalty and placed under the control of William de Braose, his father-in-law. Walter&#x27;s lands were returned to him, subject to the payment of a fine of 400 marks, but in 1207 his disagreements with royal officials in Ireland led to King John seizing the castle and putting it under the control of William again. Walter reconciled himself with John the following year, but meanwhile William himself had fallen out with the King; violence broke out and both Walter and William took refuge in Ireland, with John taking control of Ludlow yet again. It was not until 1215 that their relationship recovered and John agreed to give Ludlow back to Walter. At some point during the early 13th century, the innermost bailey was constructed in the castle, creating an additional private space within the inner bailey.

In 1223, King Henry III met with the Welsh prince Llywelyn ab Iorwerth at Ludlow Castle for peace talks, but the negotiations were unsuccessful. The same year Henry became suspicious of Walter&#x27;s activities in Ireland and, among other measures to secure his loyalty, Ludlow Castle was taken over by the Crown for a period of two years. This was cut short in May 1225 when Walter carried out a campaign against Henry&#x27;s enemies in Ireland and paid the King 3,000 marks for the return of his castles and lands. During the 1230s, however, Walter had accumulated a thousand pounds of debt to Henry and private moneylenders which he was unable to repay. As a result, in 1238 he gave Ludlow Castle as collateral to the King, although the fortification was returned to him sometime before his death in 1241.

Walter&#x27;s granddaughters Maud and Margaret were due to inherit Walter&#x27;s remaining estates on his death, but they were still unmarried, making it hard for them to hold property in their own right. Henry informally divided the lands up between them, giving Ludlow to Maud and marrying her to one of his royal favourites, Peter de Geneva, cancelling many of the debts they had inherited from Walter at the same time. Peter died in 1249 and Maud married a second time, this time to Geoffrey de Geneville, a friend of the Prince Edward, the future king. In 1260, Henry officially split up Walter&#x27;s estate, allowing Geoffrey to retain the castle.

Henry lost control of power in the 1260s, resulting in the Second Barons&#x27; War across England. Following the Royalist defeat in 1264, the rebel leader Simon de Montfort seized Ludlow Castle, but it was recaptured shortly afterwards by Henry&#x27;s supporters, probably led by Geoffrey de Geneville. Prince Edward escaped from captivity in 1265 and met up with his supporters at the castle, before commencing his campaign to retake the throne, culminating in de Montfort&#x27;s defeat at Evesham later that year. Geoffrey continued to occupy the castle for the rest of the century under Edward I&#x27;s rule, prospering until his death in 1314. Geoffrey built the Great Hall and the Solar block during his tenure of the castle, either between 1250 and 1280, or later, in the 1280s and 1290s. The town walls of Ludlow also began to be constructed in the 13th century, probably from 1260 onwards, and these were linked to the castle to form a continuous ring of defences around the town.

=== 14th century ===
Geoffrey and Maud&#x27;s oldest granddaughter, Joan, married Roger Mortimer in 1301, giving Mortimer control of Ludlow Castle. Around 1320, Roger built the Great Chamber block alongside the existing Great Hall and Solar complex, copying what was becoming a popular tripartite design for domestic castle buildings in the 14th century; an additional building was also constructed by Roger on the location of the later Tudor Lodgings, and the Guardrobe Tower was added to the curtain wall. Between 1321 and 1322 Mortimer found himself on the losing side of the Despenser War and, after being imprisoned by Edward II, he escaped from the Tower of London in 1323 into exile.

While in France, Mortimer formed an alliance with Queen Isabella, Edward&#x27;s estranged wife, and together in 1327 they seized power in England. Mortimer was made the Earl of March and became extremely wealthy, possibly entertaining Edward III at the castle in 1329. The earl built a new chapel in the Outer Bailey, named after Saint Peter, honouring the saint&#x27;s day on which he had escaped from the Tower. Mortimer&#x27;s work at Ludlow was probably intended to produce what the historian David Whitehead has termed a &quot;show castle&quot; with chivalric and Arthurian overtones, echoing the now archaic Norman styles of building. Mortimer fell from power the following year and was executed but his widow Joan was permitted to retain Ludlow.

Ludlow Castle gradually became the Mortimer family&#x27;s most important property, but for much of the rest of the century its owners were too young to control the castle personally. The castle was first briefly inherited by Mortimer&#x27;s son, Edmund, and then in 1331 Mortimer&#x27;s young grandson, Roger, who eventually became a prominent soldier in the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Roger&#x27;s young son, Edmund, inherited the castle in 1358, and also grew up to become involved in the war with France. Both Roger and Edmund used a legal device called &quot;the use&quot;, effectively giving Ludlow Castle to trustees during their lifetimes in exchange for annual payments; this reduced their tax liabilities and gave them more control over the distribution of the estates on their deaths. Edmund&#x27;s son, another Roger, inherited the castle in 1381, but King Richard II took the opportunity of Roger&#x27;s minority to exploit the Mortimer estates until they were put into the control of a committee of major nobles. When Roger died in 1398, Richard again took wardship of the castle on behalf of the young heir, Edmund, until he was deposed from power in 1399.

=== 15th century ===

Ludlow Castle was in the wardship of King Henry IV, when the Owain Glyndŵr revolt broke out across Wales. Military captains were appointed to the castle to protect it from the rebel threat, in the first instance John Lovel and then Henry&#x27;s half-brother, Sir Thomas Beaufort. Roger Mortimer&#x27;s younger brother, Edmund, set out from the castle with an army against the rebels in 1402, but was captured at the Battle of Bryn Glas. Henry refused to ransom him, and he eventually married one of Glyndŵr&#x27;s daughters, before dying during the siege of Harlech Castle in 1409.

Henry placed the young heir to Ludlow, another Edmund Mortimer, under house arrest in the south of England, and kept a firm grip on Ludlow Castle himself. This persisted until Henry V finally granted Edmund his estates in 1413, with Edmund going on to serve the Crown overseas. As a result, the Mortimers rarely visited the castle during the first part of the century, despite the surrounding town having become prosperous in the wool and cloth trades. Edmund fell heavily into debt and having sold his rights to his Welsh estates to a consortium of nobles, before dying childless in 1425.

The castle was inherited by Edmund&#x27;s sister&#x27;s young son, Richard the Duke of York, who took possession in 1432. Richard took a keen interest in the castle, which formed the administrative base for his estates around the region, possibly living there in the late 1440s and definitely residing there for much of the 1450s. Richard also established his sons, including the future Edward IV, and their household at the castle in the 1450s, and was possibly responsible for rebuilding the northern part of the Great Tower during this period.

The Wars of the Roses broke out between the Lancastrian and Richard&#x27;s Yorkist factions in the 1450s. Ludlow Castle did not find itself in the front-line of most of the conflict, instead acting as a safe retreat away from the main fighting. An exception to this was the Battle of Ludford Bridge which took place just outside the town of Ludlow in 1459, resulting in a largely bloodless victory for the Lancastrian Henry VI. After the battle, in a bid to break Richard&#x27;s power over the region, Edmund de la Mare was placed in charge of the castle as constable, with John Talbot, the Earl of Shrewsbury, being given the wider lordship. Richard was killed in battle in 1460, and his son Edward seized the throne the following year, retaking control of Ludlow Castle and merging it with the property of the Crown.

The new Edward IV visited the castle regularly and established a council there to govern his estates in Wales. He probably conducted only modest work on the property, although he might have been responsible for the remodelling of the Great Tower. In 1473, possibly influenced by his own childhood experiences at Ludlow, Edward sent his eldest son, the future Edward V, and his brother Prince Richard to live at the castle, which was also made the seat of the newly created Council in the Marches of Wales. By now Ludlow had become primarily residential, rather than military, but was still rich in chivalric connotations and a valuable symbol of the Yorkist authority and their claim to the throne. Edward died in 1483, but after Henry VII took the throne in 1485 he continued to use Ludlow Castle as a regional base, granting it to his son, Prince Arthur, in 1493, and reestablishing the dormant Council in the Marches at the property.

=== 16th century ===

In 1501, Prince Arthur arrived in Ludlow for his honeymoon with his bride Catherine of Aragon, before dying the following year. The Council in the Marches of Wales continued to operate, however, under the guidance of its president, Bishop William Smyth. The council evolved into a combination of a governmental body and a court of law, settling a range of disputes across Wales and charged with maintaining general order, and Ludlow Castle became effectively the capital of Wales.

Mary Tudor, daughter of Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII, spent 19 months at Ludlow overseeing the Council of the Marches between 1525 and 1528, along with her entourage of servants, advisors, and guardians. The relatively small sum of £5 was spent restoring the castle before her arrival. The council&#x27;s wide-ranging role was reinforced in legislation in 1534, and its purpose was further elaborated in the Act of Union of 1543; some presidents, such as Bishop Rowland Lee, used its harsher powers extensively to execute local criminals, but later presidents typically preferred to punish with the pillory, whipping or imprisonment in the castle. The Great Chamber itself was used as the council&#x27;s meeting room.

The establishment of the Council in Ludlow Castle gave it a new lease of life, during a period in which many similar fortifications were falling into decay. By the 1530s, the castle needed considerable renovation; Lee began work in 1534, borrowing money to do so, but Sir Thomas Engleford complained the following year that the castle was still unfit for habitation. Lee repaired the castle roofs, probably using lead from the dissolved Carmelite friary in the town, and using the fines imposed and the goods confiscated by the court. He later claimed that the work on the castle would have cost around £500, had the Crown had to pay for it all directly. The porter&#x27;s lodge and prison were built in the outer bailey around 1552. The woods around the castle were gradually cut down during the 16th century.

Elizabeth I, influenced by her royal favourite Robert Dudley, appointed Sir Henry Sidney as President of the Council in 1560, and he took up residence at Ludlow Castle. Henry was a keen antiquarian with an interest in chivalry, and used his post to restore much of the castle in a late-perpendicular style. He extended the castle by building family apartments between the Great Hall and Mortimer&#x27;s Tower, and used the former royal apartments as a guest wing, starting a tradition of decorating the Great Hall with the coats of arms of council officers. The larger windows in the castle were glazed, a clock installed and water piped into the castle. The judicial facilities were improved with a new courthouse converted out of the 14th-century chapel, facilities for prisoners and storage facilities for the court records, Mortimer&#x27;s Tower in the outer bailey being turned into a record depository. The restoration was generally sympathetic and, although it included a fountain, a real tennis court, walks and viewing platform, it was less ephemeral a make-over than seen in other castle restorations of the period.

=== 17th century ===

The castle was luxuriously appointed by the 17th century, with an expensive, but grand, household based around the Council of the Marches. The future Charles I was declared Prince of Wales in the castle by James I in 1616, and Ludlow was made his principal castle in Wales. A company called the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Players&quot; entertained the Council in the 1610s, and in 1634 John Milton&#x27;s masque &quot;Comus&quot; was performed in the Great Hall for John Egerton, Earl of Bridgewater. The Council faced increased criticism over its legal practices, however, and in 1641 an Act of Parliament stripped it of its judicial powers.

When the English Civil War broke out in 1642 between the supporters of King Charles and those of Parliament, Ludlow and the surrounding region supported the Royalists. A Royalist garrison was put in place in the town, under the command of Sir Michael Woodhouse, and the defences were strengthened, with artillery being brought from nearby Bringewood Forge for the castle. As the war turned against the King in 1644, the garrison was drawn down to provide reinforcements for the field army. The military situation deteriorated and in 1645 the remaining outlying garrisons were drawn in to protect Ludlow itself. In April 1646 Sir William Brereton and Colonel John Birch led a Parliamentary army from Hereford to take Ludlow; after a short siege, Woodhouse surrendered the castle and town on good terms on 26 May.

During the years of the interregnum, Ludlow Castle continued to be run by Parliamentarian governors, the first being the military commander Samuel More. There was a Royalist plot to retake the castle in 1648, but no other military activity took place. The most valuable items in the castle were removed shortly after the siege, and the remainder of the luxurious furnishings were sold off in the town in 1650. The castle was initially kept garrisoned, but in 1653, most of the weapons in the castle were removed on the grounds of security and sent to Hereford, then in 1655 the garrison was disbanded altogether. In 1659, the political instability in the Commonwealth government led to the castle being regarrisoned by 100 men under the command of William Botterell.

Charles II returned to the throne in 1660 and reinstated the Council of the Marches in 1661, but the castle never recovered from the war. Richard Vaughan, the Earl of Carbery, was appointed president and given £2,000 to renovate the castle, and between 1663 and 1665, a company of infantry soldiers was garrisoned there, overseen by the earl, with the task of safeguarding the money and contents of the castle as well as the ammunition for the local Welsh militia. The Council of the Marches failed to reestablish itself and was finally disbanded in 1689, bringing an end to Ludlow Castle&#x27;s role in government. Uncared for, the condition of the castle rapidly deteriorated.

=== 18th century ===

The castle remained in disrepair, and in 1704 its governor, William Gower, proposed dismantling the castle and building a residential square on the site instead, in a more contemporary style. His proposal was not adopted but, by 1708, only three rooms were still in use in the hall range, many of the other buildings in the inner bailey had fallen into disuse, and much of the remaining furniture was rotten or broken. Shortly after 1714, the roofs were stripped of their lead and the wooden floors began to collapse; the writer Daniel Defoe visited in 1722, and noted that the castle &quot;is in the very Perfection of Decay&quot;. Nonetheless, some rooms remained usable for many years afterwards, possibly as late as the 1760s and 1770s, when drawings show the entrance block to the inner bailey to still be intact, and visitors remarked on the good condition of the round chapel. The stonework became overgrown with ivy, trees and shrubs, and by 1800 the chapel of Saint Mary Magdalene had finally degenerated into ruin.

Alexander Stuart, an Army captain who served as the last governor of the castle, stripped down what remained of the fortification in the mid-1700s. Some of the stone was reused to build the Bowling Green House – later renamed the Castle Inn – on the north end of the tennis courts, while the north side of the outer bailey was used to make the bowling green itself. Stuart lived in a house in Ludlow itself, but decorated the Great Hall with the remains of the castle armoury, and may have charged visitors for admittance.
It became fashionable to restore castles as private homes, and the future George II may have considered making Ludlow habitable again, but was deterred by the estimated costs of £30,000. Henry Herbert, the Earl of Powis, later became interested in acquiring the castle and in 1771 approached the Crown about leasing it. It is uncertain if he intended to further strip the castle of its materials or, more likely, if he intended to turn it into a private home, but the castle was, according to Powis&#x27; surveyor&#x27;s report later that year, already &quot;extremely ruinous&quot;, the walls &quot;mostly rubble and the battlements greatly decayed&quot;. The Crown offered a 31-year lease at £20 a year, which Powis accepted in 1772, only to die shortly afterwards.

Henry&#x27;s son, George Herbert, the 2nd Earl, maintained the lease and his wife, Henrietta, constructed gravel-laid public walks around the castle, dug into the surrounding cliffs, and planted trees around the grounds to improve the castle&#x27;s appearance. The castle walls and towers were given superficial repairs and tidied up, usually when parts threatened to collapse, and the interior of the inner bailey levelled, costing considerable sums of money. The landscape also required expensive maintenance and repairs.

The town of Ludlow was increasingly fashionable and frequented by tourists, with the castle forming a particularly popular attraction. Thomas Warton published an edition of Milton&#x27;s poems in 1785, describing Ludlow Castle and popularising the links to &quot;Comus&quot;, reinforcing the castle&#x27;s reputation as a picturesque and sublime location. The castle became a topic for painters interested in these themes: J. M. W. Turner, Francis Towne, Thomas Hearne, Julius Ibbetson, Peter de Wint and William Marlowe all produced depictions of the castle during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, usually taking some artistic licence with the details in order to produce atmospheric works.

=== 19th century ===

Lord Clive, George&#x27;s brother-in-law and heir, attempted to acquire the lease after 1803, citing the efforts that the family had put into restoring the castle. He faced competition for the lease from the government&#x27;s Barrack Office, who were considering using the castle as a French prisoner-of-war camp for up to 4,000 inmates from the Napoleonic Wars. After some extensive discussions the prisoner-of-war plan was finally dropped, and Lord Clive, by now declared the Earl of Powis, was offered the chance to buy the castle outright for £1,560, which he accepted in 1811.

Between 1820 and 1828 the earl had converted the abandoned tennis court and the Castle Inn – which he closed in 1812 after buying the castle – into a new, grand building, called Castle House, overlooking the north side of the outer bailey. By the 1840s the house had been leased out, first to George Hodges and his family, and then to William Urwick and to Robert Marston, all important members of the local landowning classes. The mansion included a drawing room, dining room, study, servants&#x27; quarters, a conservatory and grapevines, and in 1887 was worth £50 a year in rent.

Ludlow Castle was held in high esteem by Victorian antiquarians, George Clark referring to it as &quot;the glory of the middle marches of Wales&quot; and as being &quot;probably without rival in Britain&quot; for its woodland setting. When Ludlow became connected to the growing railway network in 1852, the numbers of tourists to the castle increased, with admission costing six pence in 1887. During the 19th century, vegetation continued to grow over the castle&#x27;s stonework, although after a survey by Arthur Blomfield in 1883, which highlighted the damage being caused by the ivy, attempts were made to control the plants, cleaning them off many of the walls. The castle was put to a wide range of uses. The grassy areas of the bailey were kept cropped by grazing sheep and goats, and used for fox hunting meetings, sporting events and agricultural shows; parts of the outer bailey was used as a timber yard, and, by the turn of the century, the old prison was used as an ammunition store by the local volunteer militia.

=== 20th century ===

W. H. St John Hope and Harold Brakspear began a sequence of archaeological investigations at Ludlow Castle in 1903, publishing their conclusions in 1909 in an account which continues to be held in regard by modern academics. George Herbert, the Earl of Powis, cleared away much of the ivy and vegetation from the castle stonework. In 1915 the castle was declared an ancient monument by the state, but it continued to be owned and maintained by the earl and trustees of the Powis estate.

The castle was increasingly rigorously maintained, and during the 1910s and 1920s the larger trees around the castle were cut down, and the animals were cleared from the inner and outer baileys on the basis that they posed a health and safety risk to visitors. The 1930s saw a major effort to clear the remaining vegetation from the castle, the cellars were cleared of debris by the government&#x27;s Office of Works and the stable block was converted into a museum. Tourists continued to visit the castle, with the 1920s and 1930s seeing many day-trips by teams of workers in the region encouraged by the growth in motor transport. The open spaces inside the castle were used by the local townsfolk for football matches and similar events, and in 1934 Milton&#x27;s &quot;Comus&quot; was restaged in the castle to mark the 300th anniversary of the first such event.

Castle House in the outer bailey was leased to the diplomat Sir Alexander Stephen in 1901, who carried out extensive work on the property in 1904, extending and modernising the north end of the house, including constructing a billiard room and a library; he estimated the cost of the work to be around £800. Castle House continued to be leased out by the Powis estate to wealthy individuals up until the Second World War. One such lessee, Richard Henderson observed that he had spent around £4,000 maintaining and upgrading the property, and the rentable value of the property rose from £76 to £150 over the period.

During the Second World War the castle was used by the Allied military. The Great Tower was used as a look-out post and United States&#x27; forces used the castle gardens for baseball games. Castle House fell empty after the death of its final lessee, James Geenway; the house was then briefly requisitioned in 1942 by the Royal Air Force and turned into flats for key war workers, causing extensive damage later estimated at £2,000. In 1956, Castle House was de-requisitioned and sold by the Earl of Powis the following year to Ludlow Borough Council for £4,000, which rented out the flats.

During the 1970s and early 1980s the Department of the Environment assisted the Powis estate by lending government staff to repair the castle. Visitor numbers were falling, however, in part due to the dilapidated condition of the property, and the estate became increasingly unable to afford to maintain the castle. After 1984, when the function of the department was taken over by English Heritage, a more systematic approach was put into place. This based around a partnership in which the Powis Estate would retain ownership of the castle and develop visitor access, in exchange for a £500,000 contribution from English Heritage for a jointly-funded programme of repairs and maintenance, delivered through specialist contractors. This included repairs to the parts of the curtain wall, which collapsed in 1990, and the redevelopment of the visitor&#x27;s centre. Limited archaeological excavation was carried out in the outer bailey between 1992 and 1993 by the City of Hereford Archaeology Unit.

=== 21st century ===
In the 21st century, Ludlow Castle is owned by John Herbert, the current Earl of Powis, but is held and managed by the Trustees of the Powis Castle Estate as a tourist attraction. The castle was receiving over 100,000 visitors a year by 2005, more than in previous decades. The castle traditionally hosts a Shakespearean play as part of the annual cultural Ludlow Festival in the town, and is at the centre of the Ludlow Food and Drink Festival each September.

English Heritage considers Ludlow to be &quot;one of England&#x27;s finest castle sites&quot;, with the ruins representing &quot;a remarkably complete multi-phase complex&quot;. It is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building. By the 21st century, however, Castle House had become dilapidated and English Heritage placed it on its &quot;at risk&quot; register. In 2002, the Powis Estate repurchased the property from the South Shropshire District Council for £500,000, renovating it and converting it for use as offices and rental apartments, reopening the building in 2005.

== Architecture ==
Ludlow Castle sits on a rocky promontory, overlooking the modern town of Ludlow on lower ground to the east, while the ground slopes steeply from the castle to the rivers Corve and Teme to the south and west, about below. The castle is broadly rectangular in shape, and approximately in size, covering almost in total. The interior is divided into two main parts: an inner bailey which occupies the north-west corner and a much larger outer bailey. A third enclosure, known as the innermost bailey, was created in the early 13th century when walls were built to enclose the south-west corner of the inner ward. The castle&#x27;s walls are linked to Ludlow&#x27;s medieval town wall circuit on the south and east sides. The castle is built from a range of different types of stone; the Norman stone work is constructed from greenish-grey siltstone rubble, with the ashlar and quoin features carved from red sandstone, with the later work primarily using local red sandstone.

=== Outer bailey ===

The outer bailey is entered through a gatehouse; inside, the space within the curtain walls is divided into two. On the north side of the outer bailey is Castle House and its gardens; the house is a two-storeyed property, based around the old walls of the tennis court and the Castle Inn, and the curtain wall. The north end of Castle House butts onto Beacon Tower, overlooking the town.

The other half of the outer bailey houses the 16th-century porter&#x27;s lodge, prison and stable block which run along its eastern edge. The porter&#x27;s lodge and prison comprise two buildings, and across, both two-storeyed and well built in ashlar stone, with a stable block on the far end, more crudely built in stone and in size. The exterior of the prison was originally decorated with the coats of arms of Henry, the Earl of Pembroke, and Queen Elizabeth I, but these have since been destroyed, as have the barred windows which once protected the property.

Along the south of the bailey are the remains of St Peter&#x27;s, a former 14th-century chapel, approximately in size, later converted to a courthouse by the addition of an extension reaching up to the western curtain wall. The courtroom occupied the whole of the combined first floor with records kept in the rooms underneath. The south-west corner of the outer bailey is cut off by a modern wall from the rest of the bailey.

The western curtain wall is approximately thick, and guarded by the 13th-century Mortimer&#x27;s Tower, across externally, with a ground floor vaulted chamber inside, large. When first built, Mortimer&#x27;s Tower was a three-storey gateway with an unusual D-shaped design, possibly similar to those at Trim Castle in Ireland, but in the 15th century the entrance way was blocked up to turn it into a conventional mural tower, and in the 16th century an additional internal floor was inserted. The tower is now roofless, although it was roofed as late as the end of the 19th century.

=== Inner bailey ===

The inner bailey represents the extent of the original Norman castle and is protected by a curtain wall between and thick. On the south and west sides the wall is protected by a ditch, originally up to deep, cut out of the rock and navigated by a bridge which still contains part of the ashlar stone of its 16th century predecessor. Within the inner bailey, a separate area, called the innermost bailey, was created by the addition of a thick stone wall around the south-west corner in the early 13th century.

The gatehouse to the inner bailey has the coats of arms of Sir Henry Sidney and Queen Elizabeth I displayed over it, dating to 1581, and was originally a three-storeyed building with transomed windows and fireplaces, probably used as the lodgings for the judges. There were probably additional heraldic supporters displayed alongside the arms, since lost. A porter&#x27;s lodge would have been on the right hand side of the entrance to control access, with the rooms accessed by a spiral staircase in a protruding tower, with prominent triple chimneys, since lost. Alongside the gatehouse was originally a half-timbered building, possibly a laundry, approximately , which has since been lost.

On the east side of the bailey is the 12th-century chapel of Saint Mary Magdalene. The circular, Romanesque design of the chapel is unusual, with only three similar examples existing in England, at Castle Rising, Hereford and Pevensey. Built from sandstone, the circular design imitates the shrine at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Originally the chapel had a nave, a square presbytery, in size, and a chancel, but this design was heavily altered in the 16th century and only the nave survives. Although roofless, the nave survives to its full height and is in diameter, visibly divided into two sections by different bands of stonework, and with some plaster surviving on the lower level. Around the inside of the nave are 14 arcaded bays in the walls.

The north end of the bailey is occupied by a range of buildings, the Solar block, the Great Hall and the Great Chamber block, with the Tudor Lodgings in the north-east corner. The Tudor Lodgings take the form of two rhomboids to fit into the space provided by the curtain wall, divided by a cross-wall, the west side being approximately , and the east side . They were entered by a shared spiral staircase, a design used in various episcopal palaces in the 16th century, and originally provided sets of individual offices and personal rooms for the court officials, later being converted into two distinct apartments.

The Great Chamber block adjoining the Tudor Lodgings dates from around 1320. Another rhomboid design, approximately across, this originally had its main chamber on the first floor, but has been much altered over the subsequent years. The carved corbel heads that survive on the first floor may represent Edward II and Queen Isabella. Behind the Great Chamber block is the Guardrobe Tower, a four-storeyed construction, providing a combination of bed chambers and guardrobes.

In the 13th-century Great Hall, the hall itself was also positioned on the first floor, originally fitted with a wooden floor supported by stone pillars in the basement, and a massive wooden roof. It was across: this 2:1 ratio between length and width was typical for castle halls of this period. The hall was reached by a flight of stone steps at the west end, and lit by three tall, trefoiled windows, each originally with its own window seat and south-facing to receive the sunlight. Originally the hall had an open fire in the centre, which was normal for the 13th century, but the middle window was turned into a more modern fireplace around 1580.

To the west of the Great Hall is the three-storeyed Solar block, an irregular oblong measuring up to in size. The first floor chamber would probably have been used as a solar, with the cellar being used as a service area. The Great Hall and Solar block were built at the same time in the 13th century, the builders carving out the inside of the old Norman tower behind them in the process. They were probably built in two phases and were originally intended to be smaller, less grand buildings, only for the design to be changed about halfway through construction; they were finished in a rushed manner, the traces of which can still be seen, along with other changes made in the 16th and 17th centuries.
The North-West and North-East towers behind the northern range are Norman in origin, from the 11th and early 12th century. When first built, they were created by pushing or folding the line of the curtain wall outwards to create the desired external shape, and then adding timber floors and a timber wall at the back, rather than being designed as individual buildings. The timber parts of the towers were later replaced in stone, and incorporated into the later range of buildings. The North-East Tower, also known as the Pendover Tower, was originally two-storeys high, with a third floor added on in the 14th century, followed by an extensive remodelling of the inside in the 16th century. It has chamfered angles on the external corners to make it harder to attack the stonework, although this has weakened the structural strength of the tower as a whole. The North-West Tower had similar chamfered corners, but the Closet Tower was built alongside it in the 13th century, altering the external appearance. Two more Norman towers survive in the innermost bailey, the West Tower, also known as the Postern Tower, because it contained a postern gate, and the South-West tower, also called the Oven Tower, on account of its cooking facilities. The Norman towers looked out towards Wales, probably to make a symbolic statement.

A range, now lost, once stretched from the innermost bailey towards the Great Hall, including a large stone house running along the curtain wall, in size, and on the other side of the innermost bailey, the Great Kitchen, in size, built around the same time as the Great Hall, and an oven building, since lost, .

The Great Tower, or keep, is on the south side of the innermost bailey. A roughly square building, four storeys tall, most of its walls are thick, with the exception of its newer northern facing wall, only thick. The Great Tower was constructed in several stages. Originally it was a relatively large gatehouse in the original Norman castle, probably with accommodation over the gateway, before being extended to form the Great Tower in the mid-12th century, although still being used as a gatehouse for the inner bailey. When the innermost bailey was created in the early 13th century, the gateway was then filled in and a new gateway cut into the inner bailey wall just to the east of the Great Tower. Finally, the north side of the tower was rebuilt in the mid-15th century to produce the Great Tower that appears today. The keep has a vaulted basement, high, with Norman wall arcading, and a row of windows along the first floor, since mostly blocked. The arcading echoes that in the chapel, and probably dates from around 1080. The windows and large entrance-way would have looked impressive, but would also have been very hard to defend; this form of tower probably reflected earlier Anglo-Saxon high-status towers and was intended to display lordship. The first floor originally formed a tall hall, across, which was subsequently subdivided into two separate floors.

<doc id="200458" wikidata="Q621850" url="?curid=200458" title="Reflexive relation">
<text>In mathematics, a binary relation formula_1 on a set formula_2 is reflexive if it relates every element of formula_2 to itself. 

An example of a reflexive relation is the relation &quot;is equal to&quot; on the set of real numbers, since every real number is equal to itself. A reflexive relation is said to have the reflexive property or is said to possess reflexivity. Along with symmetry and transitivity, reflexivity is one of three properties defining equivalence relations.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;reflexive&quot; is originally derived from the Medieval Latin &quot;reflexivus&quot; (&#x27;recoiling&#x27; [c.f. &quot;reflex&quot;], or &#x27;directed upon itself&#x27;) (c. 1250 AD) from the classical Latin &quot;reflexus-&quot; (&#x27;turn away&#x27;, &#x27;reflection&#x27;) + &quot;-īvus&quot; (suffix). The word entered Early Modern English in the 1580s. The sense of the word meaning &#x27;directed upon itself&#x27;, as now used in mathematics, surviving mostly by its use in philosophy and grammar (c.f. &quot;Reflexive verb&quot; and &quot;Reflexive pronoun&quot;). 

The first explicit use of &quot;reflexivity&quot;, that is, describing a relation as having the property that every element is related to itself, is generally attributed to Giuseppe Peano in his &quot;Arithmetices principia&quot; (1889), wherein he defines one of the fundamental properties of equality being formula_4. The first use of the word &quot;reflexive&quot; in the sense of mathematics and logic was by Bertrand Russell in his &quot;Principles of Mathematics&quot; (1903).

== Definitions ==

A relation formula_1 on the set formula_2 is said to be if for every formula_7, formula_8.

Equivalently, letting formula_9 denote the identity relation on formula_2, the relation formula_1 is reflexive if formula_12.

The of formula_1 is the union formula_14 which can equivalently be defined as the smallest (with respect to formula_15) reflexive relation on formula_2 that is a superset of formula_17 A relation formula_1 is reflexive if and only if it is equal to its reflexive closure. 

The or of formula_1 is the smallest (with respect to formula_15) relation on formula_2 that has the same reflexive closure as formula_17 It is equal to formula_23 The reflexive reduction of formula_1 can, in a sense, be seen as a construction that is the &quot;opposite&quot; of the reflexive closure of formula_17 
For example, the reflexive closure of the canonical strict inequality formula_26 on the reals formula_27 is the usual non-strict inequality formula_28 whereas the reflexive reduction of formula_28 is formula_30 

=== Related definitions ===

There are several definitions related to the reflexive property. 
The relation formula_1 is called:
:; &#x27;, &#x27; or : if it does not relate any element to itself; that is, if formula_32 holds for no formula_33 A relation is irreflexive if and only if its complement in formula_34 is reflexive. An asymmetric relation is necessarily irreflexive. A transitive and irreflexive relation is necessarily asymmetric. 
:; : if whenever formula_35 are such that formula_36 then necessarily formula_37
:; : if whenever formula_35 are such that formula_36 then necessarily formula_40
:; : if every element that is part of some relation is related to itself. Explicitly, this means that whenever formula_35 are such that formula_36 then necessarily formula_32 and formula_40 Equivalently, a binary relation is quasi-reflexive if and only if it is both left quasi-reflexive and right quasi-reflexive. A relation formula_1 is quasi-reflexive if and only if its symmetric closure formula_46 is left (or right) quasi-reflexive.
:; antisymmetric : if whenever formula_35 are such that formula_48 then necessarily formula_49 
:; : if whenever formula_35 are such that formula_36 then necessarily formula_49 A relation formula_1 is coreflexive if and only if its symmetric closure is anti-symmetric.

A reflexive relation on a nonempty set formula_2 can neither be irreflexive, nor asymmetric (formula_1 is called if formula_56 implies not formula_57), nor antitransitive (formula_1 is if formula_59 implies not formula_60).

== Examples ==
Examples of reflexive relations include:
* &quot;is equal to&quot; (equality)
* &quot;is a subset of&quot; (set inclusion)
* &quot;divides&quot; (divisibility)
* &quot;is greater than or equal to&quot;
* &quot;is less than or equal to&quot;
Examples of irreflexive relations include:
* &quot;is not equal to&quot;
* &quot;is coprime to&quot; on the integers larger than 1
* &quot;is a proper subset of&quot;
* &quot;is greater than&quot;
* &quot;is less than&quot;

An example of an irreflexive relation, which means that it does not relate any element to itself, is the &quot;greater than&quot; relation (formula_61) on the real numbers. Not every relation which is not reflexive is irreflexive; it is possible to define relations where some elements are related to themselves but others are not (that is, neither all nor none are). For example, the binary relation &quot;the product of formula_62 and formula_63 is even&quot; is reflexive on the set of even numbers, irreflexive on the set of odd numbers, and neither reflexive nor irreflexive on the set of natural numbers. 

An example of a quasi-reflexive relation formula_1 is &quot;has the same limit as&quot; on the set of sequences of real numbers: not every sequence has a limit, and thus the relation is not reflexive, but if a sequence has the same limit as some sequence, then it has the same limit as itself. 
An example of a left quasi-reflexive relation is a left Euclidean relation, which is always left quasi-reflexive but not necessarily right quasi-reflexive, and thus not necessarily quasi-reflexive. 

An example of a coreflexive relation is the relation on integers in which each odd number is related to itself and there are no other relations. The equality relation is the only example of a both reflexive and coreflexive relation, and any coreflexive relation is a subset of the identity relation. The union of a coreflexive relation and a transitive relation on the same set is always transitive.

== Number of reflexive relations ==

The number of reflexive relations on an formula_65-element set is formula_66

== Philosophical logic ==

Authors in philosophical logic often use different terminology.
Reflexive relations in the mathematical sense are called totally reflexive in philosophical logic, and quasi-reflexive relations are called reflexive.

<text>A symmetric relation is a type of binary relation. Formally, a binary relation &quot;R&quot; over a set &quot;X&quot; is symmetric if:
: formula_1
where the notation &quot;aRb&quot; means that .

An example is the relation &quot;is equal to&quot;, because if is true then is also true. If &quot;R&quot;T represents the converse of &quot;R&quot;, then &quot;R&quot; is symmetric if and only if .

Symmetry, along with reflexivity and transitivity, are the three defining properties of an equivalence relation.

== Examples ==
=== In mathematics ===
* &quot;is equal to&quot; (equality) (whereas &quot;is less than&quot; is not symmetric)
* &quot;is comparable to&quot;, for elements of a partially ordered set
* &quot;... and ... are odd&quot;:

=== Outside mathematics ===
* &quot;is married to&quot; (in most legal systems)
* &quot;is a fully biological sibling of&quot;
* &quot;is a homophone of&quot;
* &quot;is a co-worker of&quot;
* &quot;is a teammate of&quot;

== Relationship to asymmetric and antisymmetric relations ==

By definition, a nonempty relation cannot be both symmetric and asymmetric (where if &quot;a&quot; is related to &quot;b&quot;, then &quot;b&quot; cannot be related to &quot;a&quot; (in the same way)). However, a relation can be neither symmetric nor asymmetric, which is the case for &quot;is less than or equal to&quot; and &quot;preys on&quot;).

Symmetric and antisymmetric (where the only way &quot;a&quot; can be related to &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot; be related to &quot;a&quot; is if ) are actually independent of each other, as these examples show.

== Properties ==
* A symmetric and transitive relation is always quasireflexive.
* One way to count the symmetric relations on &quot;n&quot; elements, that in their binary matrix representation the upper right triangle determines the relation fully, and it can be arbitrary given, thus there are as many symmetric relations as binary upper triangle matrices, 2&quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot;+1)/2.

<doc id="200462" wikidata="Q887525" url="?curid=200462" title="Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)">
<text>The Tasmanian Devil (also spelled Tazmanian Devil), commonly referred to as &quot;Taz&quot;, is an animated cartoon character featured in the Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons. Though the character appeared in only five shorts before Warner Bros. Cartoons shut down in 1964, marketing and television appearances later propelled Taz to new popularity throughout the 1990s.

== Personality ==

Taz is generally portrayed as a ferocious, albeit dim-witted, carnivore with a notoriously short temper and little patience. In the short &quot;Ducking the Devil,&quot; he is described as a &quot;vicious, evil-tempered brute with jaws like a steel trap&quot;. Though he can be very devious, he is also sweet at times. His enormous appetite seems to know no bounds, as he will eat anything in his path. He is best known for his speech consisting mostly of grunts, growls, and rasps (in his earlier appearances, he does speak English with primitive grammar) as well as his ability to spin like a vortex and bite through nearly anything. While in motion, he&#x27;s often depicted as a spinning tornado, drilling himself through trees or soil. Taz does have one weakness: he can be calmed by almost any music. While in this calm state, he can be easily dealt with. The only music known not to pacify Taz is the bagpipes, which he finds insufferable.

==Creation==
Robert McKimson designed the character based on the real Tasmanian devil, or more specifically its carnivorous nature, voracious appetite, and surly disposition. A later model sheet was created by animator Ted Bonnicksen.

Owen and Pemberton suggest that the character of the Tasmanian Devil was inspired by Tasmanian actor Errol Flynn. In 1939, apparently at the request of Warner Bros., the Tasmanian state government had sent three Tasmanian devils to California, where they were presented to the Los Angeles Zoo by Flynn&#x27;s co-stars the Lane Sisters. Two of the devils escaped from the zoo within months and were reported to be roaming Griffith Park.

==Appearances==
In his first appearance in McKimson&#x27;s &quot;Devil May Hare&quot; (first released on June 19, 1954), Taz stalks Bugs Bunny, but due to his dimwittedness and inability to frame complete sentences, he serves as little more than a nuisance. Bugs eventually gets rid of him in the most logical way possible: matching him up with an equally insatiable Tasmanian She-Devil. The character&#x27;s speech, a deep, gravelly voice peppered with growls, screeches, and raspberries, is provided by Mel Blanc. Only occasionally would Taz actually speak, usually to utter some incongruous punchline (e.g. &quot;What for you bury me in the cold, cold ground?&quot;), and yet the character is capable of writing and reading. A running gag is that when Bugs Bunny hears of the approach of Taz, he looks him up in an encyclopedia and starts reading off a list of animals that Taz eats (which is pretty much everything that exists, including &quot;people&quot;). Bugs finds &quot;rabbits&quot; not listed until Taz enters and either points out that &quot;rabbits&quot; &quot;are&quot; listed or writes rabbits on the list.

After the film short debuted at theaters, producer Edward Selzer, head of the Warner Bros. animation studio, ordered McKimson to shelve the character, feeling that he was too violent for children, and that parents would dislike him. After a time with no new Taz shorts, studio head Jack L. Warner asked what had happened to the character. Warner saved Taz&#x27;s career when he told Selzer that he had received &quot;boxes and boxes&quot; of letters from people who liked the character and wanted to see more of him.

McKimson would go on to direct four more Taz cartoons, beginning with &quot;Bedevilled Rabbit&quot; (released on April 13, 1957). McKimson would also pair the Devil with Daffy Duck in &quot;Ducking the Devil&quot; (August 17, 1957) before pitting him once again against Bugs in &quot;Bill of Hare&quot; (June 9, 1962) and &quot;Dr. Devil and Mr. Hare&quot; (March 28, 1964). His last two appearances done by the classic Warner Brothers directors, writers, and voice actors were in &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Looney Christmas Tales&quot; appearing in &quot;The Fright Before Christmas&quot; segment and at the very end eating the sleigh full of presents.

==Later appearances==
Taz appeared in the 1983 movie &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Movie: Fantastic Island&quot; as Yosemite Sam&#x27;s first mate.

Taz was going to have a cameo in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, but was later dropped for unknown reasons.

Taz appeared in various episodes of &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, being the mentor of Dizzy Devil. In the reboot series &quot;Tiny Toons Looniversity&quot;, he appears as the Coffeehouse owner of Loo Bru. He was voiced by Jeff Bergman, Maurice LaMarche, Noel Blanc and Greg Burson.

In 1991, Taz starred in his own show &quot;Taz-Mania&quot;, which ran for four seasons; Taz was voiced by long time voice actor Jim Cummings.

Taz appeared in &quot;Animaniacs,&quot; in the episodes &quot;Draculee, Draculaa/Phranken-Runt&quot; and &quot;Cutie and the Beast/Boo Happens/Noel&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Suffragette City&quot; in the 2020 reboot series.

Taz appeared in an episode of &quot;The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries&quot; entitled &quot;The Scare Up There&quot;, where he is revealed to have stolen peanut packs from the flights.

Taz appeared in the 1996 feature film &quot;Space Jam&quot;, as part of the &quot;TuneSquad&quot;, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. He also appeared in the 2003 feature film &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, voiced by Brendan Fraser.

An infant version of Taz is one of the regular characters in &quot;Baby Looney Tunes,&quot; voiced by Ian James Corlett.

In &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot;, Scooby-Doo briefly transforms into the Tasmanian Devil after drinking a potion.

Taz appeared in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; episode &quot;Devil Dog&quot;, voiced again by Jim Cummings. In the show, he is portrayed walking on four legs like a real Tasmanian Devil and his eyes are bloodshot red (later turned yellow when Bugs uses a taming trick that Speedy Gonzales taught him). Initially, Bugs believed Taz to be a dog and kept him as a house pet much to his roommate Daffy Duck&#x27;s discomfort. Eventually, Bugs learned the truth and tried to return him to his home in Tasmania, only to find out that Taz would rather live with him, naming him &quot;Poochie&quot;. Taz subsequently appears in the following episodes &quot;The Foghorn Leghorn Story&quot;, &quot;Newspaper Thief&quot;, and &quot;Bugs and Daffy Get a Job&quot;. Taz later played a major part in &quot;Ridiculous Journey&quot; where he, Sylvester (whom Taz tried to eat) and Tweety were accidentally sent to Alaska by Yosemite Sam. The three of them work to get home while encountering other characters and avoiding tracker Blacque Jacque Shellacque. Eventually, they make it home when it turned out that Blacque was hired by Yosemite Sam to retrieve the three on behalf of Bugs and Granny.

Taz originally appeared in the series &quot;Wabbit&quot; as Theodore Tasmanian, an accountant at Chesterfield Consultants who tries to repress his vicious side. Unlike most versions of the character, he spoke more coherently. He was also married and had a child. Taz eventually returned to his original characterization and way of speaking when the series was retooled as &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot;.

An alternate version of Taz appeared in the 2017 DC Comics/&quot;Looney Tunes&quot; crossover comics, where he was designed more for the DC Universe and faced off against Wonder Woman in the &quot;Wonder Woman/Tasmanian Devil Special&quot;. In the story, Taz is a Guardian of the Labyrinth on Themyscira and fought Diana when she was a teenager during her trials to become an Amazon warrior. Before Taz could attack her, Diana plays the harp and puts it to sleep before snipping off some of his fur as proof of her victory. She returns to Taz years later as Wonder Woman after Circe uses the Talisman of Eurytale to turn Hippolyta and the other Amazons into stone. As the Talisman can only be stopped by the Minotaur&#x27;s Amulet, she requests Taz&#x27;s help as Taz&#x27;s connection to the other Guardians would lead them down the right path. During the journey, Taz reveals that he wasn&#x27;t mad at Diana for tricking him, but was rather upset that she took the music away. The two defeat the Minotaur and Circe and the Amazons reward him with a large feast in return. In the issue&#x27;s backup story (done more in the style of the classic &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts), Diana sings to Taz the tale of the Trojan War with her and the Looney Tunes characters roleplaying the major players, but Taz in his dream alters the events to work out more in his favor.

Taz first appears in the &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot; special &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s 24-Carrot Holiday Special&quot; in where he is a caroler. Taz appears as a gladiator in the episode &quot;Taziator&quot;. While he is more like most depictions, he actually speaks more comprehensible English. He is voiced by Fred Tatasciore in these appearances.

Taz appears in the 2021 feature film &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot; with Tatasciore reprising the role, with additional dialogue done by Cummings.

Taz appears in the preschool series &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot;, voiced again by Tatasciore.

Taz appears in the 2023 direct-to-video film &quot;&quot;, voiced by Steve Blum. He speaks comprehensible English and has a raspy voice.

On June 16, 2023, it was announced Taz will appear in a stop-motion short animated by Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe.

Taz appears in the &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; episode, &quot;Warner Bros. 100th Anniversary&quot;. He is among the Looney Tunes characters guests for the Warner Bros. centennial celebration, with Fred Tatasciore reprising his role.

==Home media==
All five of the original Taz cartoons are included in &quot;Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 1&quot;, along with &quot;The Fright Before Christmas&quot;.

==In popular culture==

The character&#x27;s first video game outing was in a title from the later days of the Atari 2600, in a 1983 release entitled &quot;Taz&quot;. The 1990s saw a return of the character to video games in &quot;Taz-Mania&quot; and its semi-sequel &quot;Taz in Escape from Mars&quot;. Both titles appeared on the Mega Drive/Genesis, Master System &amp; Game Gear systems. There were other Taz-Mania games released on the Nintendo SNES and Game Boy systems. He also costarred in the PlayStation/PC game &quot;Bugs Bunny &amp; Taz: Time Busters&quot;, and in 2002&#x27;s &quot;&quot; on PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox and PC. He also appeared in the video games &quot;The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2&quot;, &quot;The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Space Race&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 3&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny in Crazy Castle 4&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, and &quot;Galactic Taz Ball&quot;. He was even the inspiration for a video game character himself, namely Crash Bandicoot.

In the late 1990s to early 2000s, when Chevrolet used the Looney Tunes as part of their NASCAR campaign, the Chevrolet Monte Carlo racing teams were referenced as Team Monte Carlo, with the Tasmanian Devil as the mascot.

Taz was a chocolate bar by Cadbury in the UK during the &#x27;90s and was later renamed Freddo Caramel.

Professional wrestler Peter Senercia adopted &quot;Taz&quot; and the variant spelling &quot;Tazz&quot; as his ring names.

In &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot; (2004), Taz is one of the forms Scooby-Doo briefly takes upon accidentally drinking a chemical substance.

From 2005 to 2010, a custom-bodied Taz monster truck competed in the Monster Jam circuit, driven by Adam Anderson. Adam drove the truck to the Monster Jam World Finals Freestyle championship in 2008. It was retired in 2010, with a Scooby-Doo-themed truck being its replacement debuting in 2013.

Taz appeared in a 2014 GEICO commercial, where he drinks a &quot;certain energy drink&quot; and goes on a rampage.

In June 2017, the character appeared in the &quot;Wonder Woman / Tasmanian Devil&quot; Special #1, written by Tony Bedard with art by Barry Kitson. This version is reimagined as a Guardian of the Labyrinth on Themyscira, whom Wonder Woman defeated when she was a teenager, but later teams up with her to save the Amazons from Circe.

In April 2017, Taz appeared in a Funko Pop! and has appeared in three more since.

Taz appears as a playable character in the fighting game &quot;MultiVersus&quot;, with Jim Cummings reprising his role.

==Trademark==

Warner Bros&#x27; trademark on the character has raised a number of issues with entities in the Australian state of Tasmania, where the Tasmanian devil is common and emblematic.

1997

In 1997, a newspaper report noted that Warner Bros had &quot;trademarked the character and registered the name Tasmanian Devil&quot;, and that this trademark &quot;was policed&quot;, including an eight-year legal battle to allow a Tasmanian company to call its fishing lure the &quot;Tasmanian Devil&quot;. Debate followed, and a delegation from the Tasmanian state government met with Warner Bros. Ray Groom, the Tourism Minister, later announced that a &quot;verbal agreement&quot; had been reached. An annual fee would be paid to Warner Bros in return for the Government of Tasmania being able to use the image of Taz for &quot;marketing purposes&quot;. This agreement later lapsed.

In 1997, the Tasmanian government and Warner Bros. disputed the government&#x27;s right to use the character as a tourism promotion, which was offered only if a fee was paid. The government refused to pay a fee to Warner Bros.

2006

In 2006, after much lobbying from the Tasmanian government, Warner Bros decided to assist the fight against extinction of the Tasmanian devil due to devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). Tasmanian Environment Minister Judy Jackson, prior to the agreement, had heavily criticised Warner Bros., stating that the company had made millions of dollars from the character, but did not put up any money when other companies had.

The deal with Warner Bros allowed the Tasmanian government to manufacture and sell up to 5,000 special edition Taz plush toys, with all profit going towards funding scientific research into DFTD. The deal also aimed to increase public attention towards the threatening disease.

2023

Potential issues surrounding Warner&#x27;s trademark were raised after the May 2023 announcement that the Australian Football League&#x27;s 19th team licence would be given to Tasmania, as the team was widely rumoured to be wanting to use the name Tasmania Devils. The trademark issues were settled and the team was announced as the Devils in March 2024.

<text>In mathematics, a binary relation on a set is transitive if, for all elements , , in , whenever relates to and to , then also relates to .

Every partial order and every equivalence relation is transitive. For example, less than and equality among real numbers are both transitive: If and then ; and if and then .

== Definition ==

A homogeneous relation on the set is a &quot;transitive relation&quot; if,
:for all , if and , then .
Or in terms of first-order logic:
:formula_1,
where is the infix notation for .

==Examples==
As a non-mathematical example, the relation &quot;is an ancestor of&quot; is transitive. For example, if Amy is an ancestor of Becky, and Becky is an ancestor of Carrie, then Amy is also an ancestor of Carrie.

On the other hand, &quot;is the birth mother of&quot; is not a transitive relation, because if Alice is the birth mother of Brenda, and Brenda is the birth mother of Claire, then it does not follow that Alice is the birth mother of Claire. In fact, this relation is antitransitive: Alice can &quot;never&quot; be the birth mother of Claire.

Non-transitive, non-antitransitive relations include sports fixtures (playoff schedules), &#x27;knows&#x27; and &#x27;talks to&#x27;.

The examples &quot;is greater than&quot;, &quot;is at least as great as&quot;, and &quot;is equal to&quot; (equality) are transitive relations on various sets.
As are the set of real numbers or the set of natural numbers:

: whenever &quot;x&quot; &gt; &quot;y&quot; and &quot;y&quot; &gt; &quot;z&quot;, then also &quot;x&quot; &gt; &quot;z&quot;
: whenever &quot;x&quot; ≥ &quot;y&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ≥ &quot;z&quot;, then also &quot;x&quot; ≥ &quot;z&quot;
: whenever &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; and &quot;y&quot; = &quot;z&quot;, then also &quot;x&quot; = &quot;z&quot;.

More examples of transitive relations:
* &quot;is a subset of&quot; (set inclusion, a relation on sets)
* &quot;divides&quot; (divisibility, a relation on natural numbers)
* &quot;implies&quot; (implication, symbolized by &quot;⇒&quot;, a relation on propositions)

Examples of non-transitive relations:
* &quot;is the successor of&quot; (a relation on natural numbers)
* &quot;is a member of the set&quot; (symbolized as &quot;∈&quot;)
* &quot;is perpendicular to&quot; (a relation on lines in Euclidean geometry)

The empty relation on any set formula_2 is transitive because there are no elements formula_3 such that formula_4 and formula_5, and hence the transitivity condition is vacuously true. A relation containing only one ordered pair is also transitive: if the ordered pair is of the form formula_6 for some formula_7 the only such elements formula_3 are formula_9, and indeed in this case formula_10, while if the ordered pair is not of the form formula_6 then there are no such elements formula_3 and hence formula_13 is vacuously transitive.

== Properties ==

=== Closure properties ===
* The converse (inverse) of a transitive relation is always transitive. For instance, knowing that &quot;is a subset of&quot; is transitive and &quot;is a superset of&quot; is its converse, one can conclude that the latter is transitive as well.
* The intersection of two transitive relations is always transitive. For instance, knowing that &quot;was born before&quot; and &quot;has the same first name as&quot; are transitive, one can conclude that &quot;was born before and also has the same first name as&quot; is also transitive.
* The union of two transitive relations need not be transitive. For instance, &quot;was born before or has the same first name as&quot; is not a transitive relation, since e.g. Herbert Hoover is related to Franklin D. Roosevelt, who is in turn related to Franklin Pierce, while Hoover is not related to Franklin Pierce.
* The complement of a transitive relation need not be transitive. For instance, while &quot;equal to&quot; is transitive, &quot;not equal to&quot; is only transitive on sets with at most one element.

=== Other properties ===
A transitive relation is asymmetric if and only if it is irreflexive.

A transitive relation need not be reflexive. When it is, it is called a preorder. For example, on set &quot;X&quot; = {1,2,3}:

* &quot;R&quot; = {(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,3), (3,2)} is reflexive, but not transitive, as the pair (1,2) is absent,
* &quot;R&quot; = {(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,3)} is reflexive as well as transitive, so it is a preorder,
* &quot;R&quot; = {(1,1), (2,2), (3,3)} is reflexive as well as transitive, another preorder.

As a counter example, the relation formula_14 on the real numbers is transitive, but not reflexive.

==Transitive extensions and transitive closure==
Let be a binary relation on set . The &quot;transitive extension&quot; of , denoted , is the smallest binary relation on such that contains , and if and then . For example, suppose is a set of towns, some of which are connected by roads. Let be the relation on towns where if there is a road directly linking town and town . This relation need not be transitive. The transitive extension of this relation can be defined by if you can travel between towns and by using at most two roads.

If a relation is transitive then its transitive extension is itself, that is, if is a transitive relation then .

The transitive extension of would be denoted by , and continuing in this way, in general, the transitive extension of would be . The &quot;transitive closure&quot; of , denoted by or is the set union of , , , ... .

The transitive closure of a relation is a transitive relation.

The relation &quot;is the birth parent of&quot; on a set of people is not a transitive relation. However, in biology the need often arises to consider birth parenthood over an arbitrary number of generations: the relation &quot;is a birth ancestor of&quot; &quot;is&quot; a transitive relation and it is the transitive closure of the relation &quot;is the birth parent of&quot;.

For the example of towns and roads above, provided you can travel between towns and using any number of roads.

== Relation types that require transitivity ==
* Preorder – a reflexive and transitive relation
* Partial order – an antisymmetric preorder
* Total preorder – a connected (formerly called total) preorder
* Equivalence relation – a symmetric preorder
* Strict weak ordering – a strict partial order in which incomparability is an equivalence relation
* Total ordering – a connected (total), antisymmetric, and transitive relation

==Counting transitive relations==

No general formula that counts the number of transitive relations on a finite set is known. However, there is a formula for finding the number of relations that are simultaneously reflexive, symmetric, and transitive – in other words, equivalence relations – , those that are symmetric and transitive, those that are symmetric, transitive, and antisymmetric, and those that are total, transitive, and antisymmetric. Pfeiffer has made some progress in this direction, expressing relations with combinations of these properties in terms of each other, but still calculating any one is difficult. See also Brinkmann and McKay (2005).

Since the reflexivization of any transitive relation is a preorder, the number of transitive relations an on &quot;n&quot;-element set is at most 2&quot;n&quot; time more than the number of preorders, thus it is asymptotically formula_15 by results of Kleitman and Rothschild.

== Related properties ==

A relation &quot;R&quot; is called &quot;intransitive&quot; if it is not transitive, that is, if &quot;xRy&quot; and &quot;yRz&quot;, but not &quot;xRz&quot;, for some &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;.
In contrast, a relation &quot;R&quot; is called &quot;antitransitive&quot; if &quot;xRy&quot; and &quot;yRz&quot; always implies that &quot;xRz&quot; does not hold.
For example, the relation defined by &quot;xRy&quot; if &quot;xy&quot; is an even number is intransitive, but not antitransitive. The relation defined by &quot;xRy&quot; if &quot;x&quot; is even and &quot;y&quot; is odd is both transitive and antitransitive. 
The relation defined by &quot;xRy&quot; if &quot;x&quot; is the successor number of &quot;y&quot; is both intransitive and antitransitive. Unexpected examples of intransitivity arise in situations such as political questions or group preferences.

Generalized to stochastic versions (&quot;stochastic transitivity&quot;), the study of transitivity finds applications of in decision theory, psychometrics and utility models.

A &quot;quasitransitive relation&quot; is another generalization; it is required to be transitive only on its non-symmetric part. Such relations are used in social choice theory or microeconomics.

Proposition: If &quot;R&quot; is a univalent, then R;RT is transitive.
: proof: Suppose formula_16 Then there are &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; such that formula_17 Since &quot;R&quot; is univalent, &quot;yRb&quot; and &quot;aR&quot;T&quot;y&quot; imply &quot;a&quot;=&quot;b&quot;. Therefore &quot;x&quot;R&quot;a&quot;RT&quot;z&quot;, hence &quot;x&quot;R;RT&quot;z&quot; and R;RT is transitive.

Corollary: If &quot;R&quot; is univalent, then R;RT is an equivalence relation on the domain of &quot;R&quot;.
: proof: R;RT is symmetric and reflexive on its domain. With univalence of &quot;R&quot;, the transitive requirement for equivalence is fulfilled.

<doc id="200464" wikidata="Q133686" url="?curid=200464" title="Oligonucleotide">
<text>Oligonucleotides are short DNA or RNA molecules, oligomers, that have a wide range of applications in genetic testing, research, and forensics. Commonly made in the laboratory by solid-phase chemical synthesis, these small fragments of nucleic acids can be manufactured as single-stranded molecules with any user-specified sequence, and so are vital for artificial gene synthesis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing, molecular cloning and as molecular probes. In nature, oligonucleotides are usually found as small RNA molecules that function in the regulation of gene expression (e.g. microRNA), or are degradation intermediates derived from the breakdown of larger nucleic acid molecules.

Oligonucleotides are characterized by the sequence of nucleotide residues that make up the entire molecule. The length of the oligonucleotide is usually denoted by &quot;-mer&quot; (from Greek &quot;meros&quot;, &quot;part&quot;). For example, an oligonucleotide of six nucleotides (nt) is a hexamer, while one of 25 nt would usually be called a &quot;25-mer&quot;. Oligonucleotides readily bind, in a sequence-specific manner, to their respective complementary oligonucleotides, DNA, or RNA to form duplexes or, less often, hybrids of a higher order. This basic property serves as a foundation for the use of oligonucleotides as probes for detecting specific sequences of DNA or RNA. Examples of procedures that use oligonucleotides include DNA microarrays, Southern blots, ASO analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), PCR, and the synthesis of artificial genes.

Oligonucleotides are composed of 2&#x27;-deoxyribonucleotides (oligodeoxyribonucleotides), which can be modified at the backbone or on the 2&#x27; sugar position to achieve different pharmacological effects. These modifications give new properties to the oligonucleotides and make them a key element in antisense therapy.

== Synthesis ==
Oligonucleotides are chemically synthesized using building blocks, protected phosphoramidites of natural or chemically modified nucleosides or, to a lesser extent, of non-nucleosidic compounds. The oligonucleotide chain assembly proceeds in the 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; direction by following a routine procedure referred to as a &quot;synthetic cycle&quot;. Completion of a single synthetic cycle results in the addition of one nucleotide residue to the growing chain. A less than 100% yield of each synthetic step and the occurrence of side reactions set practical limits of the efficiency of the process. In general, oligonucleotide sequences are usually short (13–25 nucleotides long). The maximum length of synthetic oligonucleotides hardly exceeds 200 nucleotide residues. HPLC and other methods can be used to isolate products with the desired sequence.

== Chemical modifications ==
Creating chemically stable short oligonucleotides was the earliest challenge in developing ASO therapies. Naturally occurring oligonucleotides are easily degraded by nucleases, an enzyme that cleaves nucleotides and is ample in every cell type. Short oligonucleotide sequences also have weak intrinsic binding affinities, which contributes to their degradation in vivo.

=== Backbone modifications ===
Nucleoside organothiophosphate (PS) analogs of nucleotides give oligonucleotides some beneficial properties. Key beneficial properties that PS backbones give nucleotides are diastereomer identification of each nucleotide and the ability to easily follow reactions involving the phosphorothioate nucleotides, which is useful in oligonucleotide synthesis. PS backbone modifications to oligonucleotides protects them against unwanted degradation by enzymes. Modifying the nucleotide backbone is widely used because it can be achieved with relative ease and accuracy on most nucleotides. Fluorescent modifications on 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; end of oligonucleotides was reported to evaluate the oligonucleotides structures, dynamics and interactions with respect to environment.

=== Sugar ring modifications ===
Another modification that is useful for medical applications of oligonucleotides is 2&#x27; sugar modifications. Modifying the 2&#x27; position sugar increases the effectiveness of oligonucleotides by enhancing the target binding capabilities of oligonucleotides, specifically in antisense oligonucleotides therapies. They also decrease non specific protein binding, increasing the accuracy of targeting specific proteins. Two of the most commonly used modifications are 2&#x27;-O-methyl and the 2&#x27;-O-methoxyethyl. Fluorescent modifications on the nucleobase was also reported.

== Antisense oligonucleotides ==

Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) are single strands of DNA or RNA that are complementary to a chosen sequence. In the case of antisense RNA they prevent protein translation of certain messenger RNA strands by binding to them, in a process called hybridization. Antisense oligonucleotides can be used to target a specific, complementary (coding or non-coding) RNA. If binding takes place this hybrid can be degraded by the enzyme RNase H. RNase H is an enzyme that hydrolyzes RNA, and when used in an antisense oligonucleotide application results in 80-95% down-regulation of mRNA expression.

The use of Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides for gene knockdowns in vertebrates, which is now a standard technique in developmental biology and is used to study altered gene expression and gene function, was first developed by Janet Heasman using &quot;Xenopus&quot;. FDA-approved Morpholino drugs include eteplirsen and golodirsen. The antisense oligonucleotides have also been used to inhibit influenza virus replication in cell lines.

Neurodegenerative diseases that are a result of a single mutant protein are good targets for antisense oligonucleotide therapies because of their ability to target and modify very specific sequences of RNA with high selectivity. Many genetic diseases including Huntington&#x27;s disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have been linked to DNA alterations that result in incorrect RNA sequences and result in mistranslated proteins that have a toxic physiological effect.

== Cell internalisation ==
Cell uptake/internalisation still represents the biggest hurdle towards successful oligonucleotide (ON) therapeutics. A straightforward uptake, like for most small-molecule drugs, is hindered by the polyanionic backbone and the molecular size of ONs. The exact mechanisms of uptake and intracellular trafficking towards the place of action are still largely unclear. Moreover, small differences in ON structure/modification (vide supra) and difference in cell type leads to huge differences in uptake. It is believed that cell uptake occurs on different pathways after adsorption of ONs on the cell surface. Notably, studies show that most tissue culture cells readily take up ASOs (phosphorothiote linkage) in a non-productive way, meaning that no antisense effect is observed. In contrast to that conjugation of ASO with ligands recognised by G-coupled receptors leads to an increased productive uptake. Next to that classification (non-productive vs. productive), cell internalisation mostly proceeds in an energy-dependant way (receptor mediated endocytosis) but energy-independent passive diffusion (gymnosis) may not be ruled out. After passing the cell membrane, ON therapeutics are encapsulated in early endosomes which are transported towards late endosomes which are ultimately fused with lysosomes containing degrading enzymes at low pH. To exert its therapeutic function, the ON needs to escape the endosome prior to its degradation. Currently there is no universal method to overcome the problems of delivery, cell uptake and endosomal escape, but there exist several approaches which are tailored to specific cells and their receptors.

A conjugation of ON therapeutics to an entity responsible for cell recognition/uptake not only increases the uptake (vide supra) but is also believed to decrease the complexity of the cell uptake as mainly one (ideally known) mechanism is then involved. This has been achieved with small molecule-ON conjugates for example bearing an N-acetyl galactosamine which targets receptors of hepatocytes. These conjugates are an excellent example for obtaining an increased cell uptake paired with targeted delivery as the corresponding receptors are overexpressed on the target cells leading to a targeted therapeutic (compare antibody-drug conjugates which exploit overexpressed receptors on cancer cells). Another broadly used and heavily investigated entity for targeted delivery and increased cell uptake of oligonucleotides are antibodies.

== Analytical techniques ==

=== Chromatography ===
Alkylamides can be used as chromatographic stationary phases. Those phases have been investigated for the separation of oligonucleotides. Ion-pair reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography is used to separate and analyse the oligonucleotides after automated synthesis.

=== Mass spectrometry ===
A mixture of 5-methoxysalicylic acid and spermine can be used as a matrix for oligonucleotides analysis in MALDI mass spectrometry. ElectroSpray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) is also a powerful tool to characterize the mass of oligonucleotides.

=== DNA microarray ===
DNA microarrays are a useful analytical application of oligonucleotides. Compared to standard cDNA microarrays, oligonucleotide based microarrays have more controlled specificity over hybridization, and the ability to measure the presence and prevalence of alternatively spliced or polyadenylated sequences. One subtype of DNA microarrays can be described as substrates (nylon, glass, etc.) to which oligonucleotides have been bound at high density. There are a number of applications of DNA microarrays within the life sciences.

<text>:&quot;This is about the German philologist. For Theodor Benfey (born 1925) who developed a spiral periodic table of the elements in 1964, see Otto Theodor Benfey.&quot;

Theodor Benfey (; 28 January 1809, in Nörten near Göttingen26 June 1881, in Göttingen) was a German philologist and scholar of Sanskrit. His works, particularly his Sanskrit-English dictionary, formed a major contribution to Sanskrit studies.

==Early life and education==
Benfey was born into a Jewish family in the small town of Nörten, near the city of Göttingen in Lower Saxony. He was born during the political upheaval of the Napoleonic Wars, when Lower Saxony was occupied by the French Army (1806–1814). His father, Isaak Benfey (died 1832), was a merchant and Talmud scholar, and the family had 8 children. In 1810, when Theodor was one year old, the family relocated to Göttingen. The French occupation ended when Benfey was 5, and Gottingen, which belonged to the Electorate of Hanover, became part of the Kingdom of Hanover, then ruled over by the British House of Hanover (1814–66). Most of Benfey&#x27;s childhood and youth was lived during the post-war period, which was marked by economic impoverishment and political oppression of nationalists and liberals. Benfey attended secondary school at the Gottingen gymnasium, and was tutored in Hebrew by his father Isaak.

Theodor showed exceptional talent for languages, and the Hebrew he studied with his father gave him a taste for philology. At the age of 16, Benfey began studies at the University of Göttingen, where he studied Greek and Latin languages under Ludolf Dissen and Otfried Müller. In 1827, he travelled to Munich, where he studied under Friedrich Wilhelm Thiersch. He returned to Göttingen, where he defended his thesis titled &quot;De Liguris&quot;. His defense was successful and he was granted his Ph.D. at the age of 19. He immediately began working towards a university teaching license. In 1830, he successfully presented his dissertation, &quot;Observationes ad Anacreontis Fragmenta Genuina&quot;, and was granted a venia legendi, or license to teach university courses.

==Career==
Benfey began his teaching career that year in the city of Frankfurt, where he worked and lived for two years. He then took up a position in Heidelberg, where he remained for two years as well. These were to be the last paid teaching position that Benfey would have for nearly 14 years. In 1834, he returned to his home-town of Göttingen, where he took up a position at his &quot;alma mater&quot;, the University of Göttingen. He worked at the university as a &quot;privat-docent&quot;, a lecturer who is unpaid and untenured. It is likely that he lived with family during this time, as he had no means of income for quite some time. He searched unsuccessfully for paid work, even looking so far as France.

Initially, Benfey lectured in classical languages such as Greek and Latin, which had been the subject of his university studies and Ph.D. dissertation. While teaching in Frankfurt, he published his first book, a translation of the comedies of the Roman playwright Terence. During his first few years lecturing at the University of Gottingen, he had also begun work on a lexicon of Greek roots. It was actually by chance that Benfey was first introduced to Sanskrit: There was a wager made that Benfey could not teach himself Sanskrit in time to review a new translation of a Sanskrit book, in a mere 4 weeks. But Benfey did manage and was able to review the Latin-Sanskrit edition of the &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot; for an academic journal. This feat of learning is made all the more impressive by the fact that the only books on Sanskrit available at the time were H. H. Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Sanskrit-English Dictionary&quot;, and Monier Monier-Williams&#x27;s &quot;Sanskrit grammar&quot;, neither of which were particularly helpful, as they only superficially covered Vedic Sanskrit. The subject matter he lectured on began to broaden, and in 1836, he collaborated on &quot;Über die Monatsnamen einiger alten Völker&quot; (Month Names of Ancient Peoples) with his friend Moritz A. Stern, a Jewish mathematician who also taught at the University of Gottingen. This work demonstrated the Hebrew month-names are derived from Persian. In 1839, he also wrote an article on India for Ersch and Gruber&#x27;s &quot;Allgemeine Encyclopädie der Wissenschaften und Künste&quot; (&quot;Universal Encyclopaedia of Sciences and Arts&quot;).

In 1839, Benfey published his first major work, his &quot;Griechisches Wurzellexikon&quot; (Lexicon of Greek Roots). This work brought him degree of financial and professional success, and enabled him to marry Fanny Wallenstein in 1840. In 1842, The Institut de France awarded Benfey the prix Volney for his Lexicon, which brought him international recognition in the world of philology and comparative languages. By this time, Benfey had been working at the University of Gottingen as an unpaid privet-docent for over 8 years, and despite his experience and publications, he had never been granted a paid position. Younger, less accomplished lecturers were promoted and hired ahead of him, leading many to believe that this was a purposeful snub, and a display of prejudice against Benfey&#x27;s Jewish religion and heritage. When the university&#x27;s snub became more widely known, it sparked an international controversy, and the university was subsequently shamed into offering him a tenured position. Instrumental in securing Benfey a position was Alexander von Humboldt, a famous 19th century naturalist and explorer, who was particularly close to the Prussian monarch Frederick William IV. Alexander&#x27;s brother Wilhelm von Humboldt had also been an accomplished linguist, and had recently died. Alexander showed religious tolerance towards Judaism, and petitioned the University for a tenured position on Benfey&#x27;s behalf.

The much-deserved promotion to a paid, entry-level &quot;assistant-professor&quot; (&quot;Professor extraordinarius)&quot; did not come until 1848, and only when Benfey and his family had converted from Judaism to Protestant Christianity. It has been surmised that Benfey&#x27;s conversion was not sincere, and that was made mainly for social advantages.

From this time Benfey&#x27;s attention was principally given to Sanskrit. In 1848 he became an assistant professor, and published his edition of the &quot;Samaveda&quot;; in 1852–1854 his &quot;Handbuch der Sanskritsprache&quot; (&quot;Manual of Sanskrit&quot;), comprising a grammar and chrestomathy; in 1858 his practical Sanskrit grammar, afterwards translated into English; and in 1859 his edition of the &quot;Panchatantra&quot;, with an extensive dissertation on the fables and mythologies of primitive nations. All these works had been produced under the pressure of poverty, the government, whether from parsimony or from prejudice against a Jew, refusing to make any substantial addition to his small salary as an assistant professor at the university.

At length, in 1862, the growing appreciation of foreign scholars shamed it into making him a full professor, and in 1866 Benfey published the laborious work by which he is on the whole best known, his great &quot;Sanskrit-English Dictionary&quot;. In 1869 he wrote a history of German philological research, especially Oriental, during the 19th century. In 1878 his jubilee (50th anniversary) as doctor was celebrated by the publication of a volume of philological essays dedicated to him and written by the top scholars in Germany. He had designed to close his literary labours by a grammar of Vedic Sanskrit, and was actively preparing it when he was interrupted by illness, which terminated in his death at Göttingen.

==Legacy==
In 1890, a collection of Benfey&#x27;s various writings came out accompanied by a memoir written by his son.

Among his pupils was James Murdoch. Some of his ideas were developed in Russia by Fyodor Buslaev.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Thiersch (17 June 178425 February 1860), was a German classical scholar and educator.

==Biography==
He was born at Kirchscheidungen (now a part of Laucha an der Unstrut, Saxony-Anhalt). In 1809 he became professor at the gymnasium at Munich, and in 1826 professor of ancient literature at the University of Landshut; he was transferred in that year to Munich where he remained till his death. Thiersch, the &quot;tutor of Bavaria&quot; (&quot;praeceptor Bavariae&quot;), found an extremely unsatisfactory system of education in existence. There was a violent feud between the Protestant &quot;north&quot; and the Catholic &quot;south&quot; Germans; Thiersch&#x27;s colleagues, chiefly old monks, offered violent opposition to his reforms, and an attempt was made upon his life. His plans were nevertheless carried out, and became the governing principle of the educational institutions of Bavaria.

Thiersch was an ardent supporter of Greek independence. In 1832 he visited Greece, and his influence is said to have helped secure the throne of the newly created kingdom for Otto of Greece. He wrote a Greek grammar, a metrical translation of Pindar, and an account of Greece (&quot;L&#x27;état actuel de la Grece&quot;) in 1833. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.

Thiersch died in Munich. He is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich. After his death the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften commissioned a bronze medal made by the engraver Joahnn Adam Ries in 1860.
His biography was written by his son, H. W. J. Thiersch (1866). Another son, Karl Thiersch, was a renowned surgeon, and yet another, Ludwig Thiersch, was an influential painter.

<text>Stephen Hunt (5 May 1966) is a British writer of fantasy novels. He was born in Canada and studied in the United Kingdom. He worked for a time managing online services for a number of newspapers and journals until he broke into writing in the 90&#x27;s. 

His writing influences include Jack Williamson, Stephen Goldin, David Gemmell, Bruce Sterling, Larry Niven and Michael Moorcock.

== Career ==
Hunt&#x27;s stories have appeared in various magazines in the US and UK. Some of his earliest works were written in the cyberpunk style. One of these was &quot;The Hollow Duelists&quot;, which won the 1992 &quot;ProtoStellar&quot; Prize for Best Short Fiction Story.

Hunt&#x27;s first fantasy novel, &quot;For the Crown and the Dragon&quot;, was published in 1994 after winning the WH Smith&#x27;s New Talent Award. Reviewer Andrew Darlington used Hunt&#x27;s novel to coin the phrase &quot;Flintlock Fantasy&quot;, describing the subgenre of fantasy set in a Regency or Napoleonic-era period. 

In 2005, Hunt became the first client of the John Jarrold Literary Agency. His second novel, &quot;The Court of the Air&quot;, the first of Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Jackelian&quot; series, was published by Harper Collins in 2007. &quot;The Court of the Air&quot; was one of ten books selected by the Berlinale Film Festival/Co-Production Market organisers for presentation to US and European film producers.

Later works include the &quot;Sliding Void&quot; series, published under the Green Nebula imprint, and the &quot;Far-called&quot; series, the first book of which, &quot;In Dark Service&quot;, was published by Gollancz in 2014.

In 2011, Hunt was among 85 authors - which included Iain M Banks, Elizabeth Moon and Michael Moorcock - who wrote to the BBC&#x27;s director general, Mark Thompson, attacking its &quot;sneering&quot; coverage of genre fiction on World Book Day. The BBC subsequently asserted its commitment to genre fiction in all forms.

<doc id="200475" wikidata="Q83317" url="?curid=200475" title="Mosul">
<text>Mosul ( ; , , ; ; ; ) is a major city in northern Iraq, serving as the capital of Nineveh Governorate. It is the second largest city in Iraq overall after the capital Baghdad. Situated on the banks of Tigris, the city encloses the ruins of the ancient Assyrian city of Nineveh—once the largest city in the world—on its east side.

Due to its strategic and central location, the city has traditionally served as one of the hubs of international commerce and travel in the region. It is considered as of the one of the historically and culturally significant cities of the Arab world. The North Mesopotamian dialect of Arabic commonly known as &quot;Moslawi&quot; is named after Mosul, and is widely spoken in the region. Together, with the Nineveh Plains, Mosul is a historical center of the Assyrians. The surrounding region is ethnically and religiously diverse; a large majority of the city is Arabs, with Kurds, Assyrians, Turkmens, Shabaks, and other minorities comprising the population. Sunni Islam is the largest religion, but there is a sizeable number of Christians and Yazidis, as well as adherents of other Islamic sects such as Shi&#x27;ites and Shabakis and formerly Jews.

During the invasion of Iraq, Mosul was captured by United States-led coalition forces in April 2003. Throughout the war, the city was subjected to attacks, bombings, and a sectarian civil war. After the withdrawal of American troops in 2011, an Islamist insurgency began, and the Islamic State started its territorial expansion. Mosul fell to ISIS in 2014, causing around 500,000 people to flee the city. Christians and Yazidis were persecuted, prompting a mass exodus of Assyrians. Much of the city&#x27;s cultural heritage was destroyed in by the ISIS. With the help of an international intervention and support from the United States, the Iraqi Armed Forces successfully liberated the city. On 9 July 2017, prime minister Haider al-Abadi officially declared the city&#x27;s liberation from the ISIS militants. Currently, the city is reviving its lost legacy, with help of foreign funds for reconstruction.

The metropolitan area has grown from the old city on the western side to encompass substantial areas on both the &quot;Left Bank&quot; (east side) and the &quot;Right Bank&quot; (west side), as locals call the two respective sides of the Tigris. Historically, essential products of the area included marble and oil. The region around Mosul is rich in oil reserves. Mosul is home to the University of Mosul and its renowned Medical College, one of the Middle East&#x27;s largest educational and research centers. The city is also home to historic mosques, Christian sites, synagogues and Yazidi temples.

==Etymology==
In its current Arabic form and spelling (الموصل), the term &quot;Mosul&quot; (or rather &quot;Mawsil&quot;) means &quot;linking point&quot;, or, loosely, &quot;Junction City&quot;. On the city&#x27;s eastern side are the ruins of the ancient city of Nineveh, and Assyrians still call the entire city &quot;Nineveh&quot; (or &quot;Ninweh&quot;).

An early settlement, possibly on the site of the current city of Mosul, was first mentioned by Xenophon in his expeditionary logs of Achaemenid Assyria in 401 BC, during the reign of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. There, he notes a small Assyrian town of &quot;Mépsila&quot; () on the Tigris, near where Mosul is today (&quot;Anabasis&quot;, III.iv.10). It may be safer to identify Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Mépsila&quot; with the site of Iski Mosul, or &quot;Old Mosul,&quot; about north of modern Mosul, where six centuries after Xenophon&#x27;s report, the Sasanian Empire&#x27;s center of Budh-Ardhashir was built.

Mosul is also nicknamed &quot;al-Faiha&quot; (&quot;the Paradise&quot;), &quot;al-Khaḍrah&quot; (&quot;the Green&quot;), and &quot;al-Hadbah&quot; (&quot;the Humped&quot;). It is sometimes called &quot;The Pearl of the North&quot; and &quot;the city of a million soldiers.&quot;

==History==
===Ancient era and early Middle Ages===
The area where Mosul lies was an integral part of Assyria from as early as the 25th century BC. After the Akkadian Empire (2335–2154 BC), which united all the peoples of Mesopotamia under one rule, Mosul again became a continuous part of Assyria proper from circa 2050 BC through the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire between 612 and 599 BC. Mosul remained within the geopolitical province of Assyria for another 13 centuries (as a part of Achaemenid Assyria, Seleucid, Roman Assyria and Sasanian Asōristān) until the early Muslim conquests of the mid-7th century. After the Muslim conquests, the region saw a gradual influx of Muslim Arab, Kurdish, and Turkic peoples, although indigenous Assyrians continued to use the name &quot;Athura&quot; for the ecclesiastical province. 

Nineveh was one of the oldest and most significant cities in antiquity and was settled as early as 6000 BC. The city is mentioned in the Old Assyrian Empire (2025–1750 BC) and during the reign of Shamshi-Adad I (1809–1776 BC) it was listed as a center of worship of the goddess Ishtar, remaining so during the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365–1056 BC). During the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–605 BC), Nineveh grew in size and importance, particularly from the reigns of Tukulti-Ninurta II and Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 BC) onward; he chose the city of Kalhu (the Biblical &quot;Calah&quot;, modern Nimrud) as his capital in place of the ancient traditional capital of Aššur (Ashur), from present-day Mosul. 

Thereafter, successive Assyrian emperor-monarchs, such as Shalmaneser III, Adad-nirari III, Tiglath-Pileser III, Shalmaneser V and Sargon II, continued to expand the city. Around 700 BC, King Sennacherib made Nineveh Assyria&#x27;s new capital. Immense building work was undertaken, and Nineveh eclipsed Babylon, Kalhu and Aššur in size and importance, making it the largest city in the world. Many scholars believe the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were at Nineveh.

The mound of Kuyunjik in Mosul is the site of the palaces of King Sennacherib and his successors Esarhaddon, Ashurbanipal, (who established the Library of Ashurbanipal), Ashur-etil-ilani, Sin-shumu-lishir and Sin-shar-ishkun. The Assyrian Empire began to unravel in 626 BC, being consumed by a decade of brutal internal civil wars, significantly weakening it. A war-ravaged Assyria was attacked in 616 BC by a vast coalition of its former subjects, most notably their Babylonian relations from southern Mesopotamia, together with the Medes, Persians, Chaldeans, Scythians, Cimmerians, and Sagartians. Nineveh fell after a siege and bitter house-to-house fighting in 612 BC during the reign of Sin-shar-ishkun, who was killed defending his capital. His successor, Ashur-uballit II, fought his way out of Nineveh and formed a new Assyrian capital at Harran (now in southeastern Turkey). 

Mosul (then the Assyrian town of Mepsila, founded by the former inhabitants out of the ruins of their former capital) later succeeded Nineveh as the Tigris bridgehead of the road that linked Assyria and Anatolia with the short-lived Median Empire and succeeding Achaemenid Empire (546–332 BC), where it was a part of the geopolitical province of Athura (Assyria), where the region, and Assyria in general, saw a significant economic revival. 

Mosul became part of the Seleucid Empire after Alexander&#x27;s conquests in 332 BC. While little is known of the city from the Hellenistic period, Mosul likely belonged to the Seleucid satrapy of &quot;Syria&quot;, the Greek term for &quot;Assyria&quot; (&quot;Syria&quot; originally meaning Assyria rather than the modern nation of Syria), which the Parthian Empire conquered circa 150 BC. 

Mosul changed hands again with the rise of the Sasanian Empire in 225 and became a part of the Sasanian province of Asōristān. Christianity was present among the indigenous Assyrian people in Mosul as early as the 1st century, although the ancient Mesopotamian religion remained strong until the 4th century. It became an episcopal seat of the Assyrian Church of the East in the 6th century. 

In 637 (other sources say 641), during the period of the Caliph Umar, Mosul was annexed to the Rashidun Caliphate by Utba ibn Farqad al-Sulami during the early Arab Muslim invasions and conquests, after which Assyria dissolved as a geopolitical entity.

In the late 9th century the Turkic dynasts Ishaq ibn Kundaj and his son Muhammad seized control over Mosul, but in 893 Mosul came once again under the direct control of the Abbasid Caliphate. In the early 10th century Mosul came under the control of the native Arab Hamdanid dynasty. From Mosul, the Hamdanids under Abdallah ibn Hamdan and his son Nasir al-Dawla expanded their control over Upper Mesopotamia for several decades, first as governors of the Abbassids and later as &quot;de facto&quot; independent rulers. A century later they were supplanted by the Uqaylid dynasty.

Mosul was conquered by the Seljuk Empire in the 11th century. After a period under semi-independent atabeg such as Mawdud, in 1127 it became the centre of power of the Zengid dynasty. Saladin besieged the city of Mosul unsuccessfully in 1182 After his conquest of Aleppo in 1183, ending Zengid rule in Syria, Saladin made a last offensive against Mosul in late 1185, hoping for an easy victory over the presumably demoralized Zengid Emir of Mosul Mas&#x27;ud, but failed due to the city&#x27;s unexpectedly stiff resistance and a serious illness which caused Saladin to withdraw to Harran. Upon Abbasid encouragement, Saladin and Mas&#x27;ud negotiated a treaty in March 1186 that left the Zengids in control of Mosul, but under the obligation to supply the Ayyubids with military support when requested. The city remained in control of the Zengids, until Badr al-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27; took over from 1234 to 1259.

During the final stages of the Mongol invasion of Persia and Mesopotamia, in 1258, while about 80 years old, Badr al-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27; went in person to Meraga to offer his submission to the Mongol invader Hulagu. Badr al-Din helped the Khan in his following campaigns in Syria. Mosul was spared destruction, but Badr al-Din died shortly thereafter in 1259. Badr al-Din&#x27;s son continued in his father&#x27;s steps, but after the Mongol defeat in the Battle of Ain Jalut (1260) against the Mamluks, he sided with the latter and revolted against the Mongols. Hulagu then besieged the city of Mosul for nine month, and destroyed it in 1262. Later Mosul regained some importance but never recovered its original splendor. Mosul was thenceforth ruled by the Mongol Ilkhanate and Jalairid Sultanate and escaped Timur&#x27;s destructions.

In 1165, Benjamin of Tudela passed through Mosul. He wrote about a Jewish community of about 7,000 people led by Rabbi Zakkai, presumed to be a scion of the Davidic line. In 1288–89, when the Exilarch was in Mosul, he signed a supporting paper for Maimonides. In the early 16th century, Mosul was under the Turkmen federation of the Ağ Qoyunlu, but in 1508 it was conquered by the Safavid dynasty of Iran.

====Metalworking industry====
In the 13th century, Mosul had a flourishing industry making luxury brass items that were ornately inlaid with silver. Many of these items survive today; in fact, of all medieval Islamic artifacts, Mosul brasswork has the most epigraphic inscriptions. However, the only reference to this industry in contemporary sources is the account of Ibn Sa&#x27;id, an Andalusian geographer who traveled through the region around 1250. He wrote that &quot;there are many crafts in the city, especially inlaid brass vessels which are exported (and presented) to rulers&quot;. These were expensive items that only the wealthiest could afford, and it wasn&#x27;t until the early 1200s that Mosul had the demand for large-scale production of them. Mosul was then a wealthy, prosperous capital city, first for the Zengids and then for Badr al-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;.

The origins of Mosul&#x27;s inlaid brasswork industry are uncertain. The city had an iron industry in the late 10th century, when al-Muqaddasi recorded that it exported iron and iron goods like buckets, knives and chains. However, no surviving metal objects from Mosul are known before the early 13th century. Inlaid metalworking in the Islamic world was first developed in Khurasan in the 12th century by silversmiths facing a shortage of silver. By the mid-12th century, Herat in particular had gained a reputation for its high-quality inlaid metalwork. The practice of inlaying &quot;required relatively few tools&quot; and the technique spread westward, perhaps by Khurasani artisans moving to other cities.

By the turn of the 13th century, the silver-inlaid-brass technique had reached Mosul. A pair of engraved brass &quot;flabella&quot; found in Egypt and possibly made in Mosul are dated by a Syriac inscription to the year 1202, which would make them the earliest known Mosul brasses with a definite date (although they are not inlaid with anything). One extant item may be even older: an inlaid ewer by the master craftsman Ibrahim ibn Mawaliya is of an unknown date, but D.S. Rice estimated that it was made around 1200. Production of inlaid brasswork in Mosul may have already begun before the turn of the century.

The body of Mosul metalwork significantly expands in the 1220s – several signed and dated items are known from this decade, which according to Julian Raby &quot;probably reflects the craft&#x27;s growing status and production.&quot; In the two decades from roughly 1220 to 1240, the Mosul brass industry saw &quot;rapid innovations in technique, decoration, and composition&quot;. Artisans were inspired by miniature paintings produced in the Mosul area.

Mosul seems to have become predominant among Muslim centers of metalwork in the early 13th century. Evidence is partial and indirect – relatively few objects which directly state where they were made exist, and in the rest of cases it depends on &quot;nisbah&quot;s. However, al-Mawsili is by far the most common &quot;nisbah&quot;; only two others are attested: al-Is&#x27;irdi (referring to someone from Siirt) and al-Baghdadi. There are, however, some scientific instruments inlaid with silver that were made in Syria during this period, with the earliest being 1222/3 (619 AH).

Instability after the death of Badr al-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27; in 1259, and especially the Mongol siege and capture of Mosul in July 1262, probably caused a decline in Mosul&#x27;s metalworking industry. There is a relative lack of known metalwork from the Jazira in the late 1200s; meanwhile, an abundance of metalwork from Mamluk Syria and Egypt is attested from this same period. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that production in Mosul ended, though, and some extant objects from this period may have been made in Mosul.

The earliest definite evidence of Mawsili craftsmen emigrating westward to Mamluk Syria and Egypt dates from the 1250s. Extant Mawsili works from these regions seem to be the result of one particular family setting up workshops in Damascus and then Cairo rather than a mass movement of Mosul artisans to those cities. Five Mawsili craftsmen are known from these two cities in the late 13th century, of which 3 or 4 are members of this same family. The first is Husayn ibn Muhammad al-Mawsili, who produced the earliest known silver-inlaid work from Damascus in the late 1250s. His presumed son, Ali ibn Husayn ibn Muhammad al-Mawsili, was active in Cairo several decades later. However, the earliest known silver-inlaid brasswork from Cairo belongs to another presumed member of this family, Muhammad ibn Hasan. His one known work, a candlestick dated to 1269, has an inscription which suggests he died before it was completed. The &quot;key figure&quot; for early Mamluk metalwork in Cairo, however, was Ali ibn Husayn. His works from the 1280s both show Mosul influence as well as a different &quot;early Mamluk&quot; style. A final member was Husayn ibn Ahmad ibn Husayn, a grandson of Husayn ibn Muhammad, who was active at the turn of the 14th century and made &quot;a major work&quot; for the Rasulid sultan al-Mu&#x27;ayyad Hizabr al-Din Dawud ibn Yusuf. This family appears to have initiated &quot;two of the most characteristic features of 14th-century Mamluk metalwork: large-scale inspirational candlesticks, and large multi-lobed medallions with a wide border that eventually became filled with flying ducks&quot;.

Mosul metalwork eventually influenced a tradition of metal inlay in Fars and elsewhere in western Iran in the 14th century. The Ilkhanids rounding up artisans and gathering them in their capital of Tabriz for centralized royal production may have played a role in this transmission.

Only two items are definitively known to have been produced in Mosul. The first is the Blacas ewer, made by Shuja&#x27; ibn Man&#x27;a in 1232, and the second is a silver-inlaid pen box made by Ali ibn Yahya in 1255/6 (653 AH). No other works by either craftsman are known. They form part of the broader Mosul work which consists of 35 known surviving brasses made by artisans with the &quot;nisbah&quot; al-Mawsili, by some 27 different makers. 80% of them are from the years 1220 to 1275, and the remaining 20% are from 1275 to about 1325.

Modern western scholarship has termed this body of metalwork attributed to Mosul the &quot;Mosul School&quot;, although the validity of this grouping is disputed. The &quot;indiscriminate&quot; attribution of silver-inlaid brasses to Mosul, particularly by Gaston Migeon at the turn of the 20th century, led to a reaction against the term. Later scholars such as Max van Berchem, Mehmet Ağa-Oğlu, and D.S. Rice all took a more skeptical view; van Berchem in particular argued that only six known items could be definitely attributed to Mosul, and others were likely made elsewhere. Souren Melikian-Chirvani remarked in 1973 that Mosul had been famous in the west for a century for metalwork it did not make. However, Julian Raby has defended the concept of the Mosul School, arguing that the city did have a distinct metalworking tradition with its own techniques, styles and motifs, and sense of community. He compared Mosul&#x27;s metalwork to Kashan&#x27;s pottery and wrote that &quot;Mawsili metalworkers displayed a conscious sense of community and tradition and, at least in the early years, a proud acknowledgement of tradition&quot; and that the city&#x27;s metalwork gained a wide reputation or &quot;brand value&quot; lasting for over a century.

Part of Raby&#x27;s argument was that many items shared one or two recurring symbols that &quot;served no practical purpose&quot; and may have been meant as a &quot;brand&quot;, &quot;workshop mark&quot;, a &quot;guild emblem&quot;, or &quot;perhaps as a mark of master craftsmanship&quot;. The first one is an octagon filled with complex geometric patterns, which appears on at least 13 items over the course of three decades: the 1220s through the 1240s. Several of the most important Mosul artists from what Raby terms the &quot;second generation of Mosul metalwork&quot; all used this symbol: Ahmad al-Dhaki, Ibn Jaldak, Shuja&#x27; ibn Man&#x27;a, Dawud ibn Salama, and Yunus ibn Yusuf. A notable absence is Ibrahim ibn Mawaliya, a member of the first generation. The octagon disappears after about 1250, and is also not used by workers known to have been outside Mosul.

Another recurring symbol is a rosette with either 10 or 12 leaves found at the bottom of the item – either the base of a ewer or the bottom of the shaft of a candlestick. This is not normally visible, and perhaps because it served no practical purpose, it was eventually abandoned around the middle of the century. The last example of this rosette is the bottom of a candlestick made by Dawud ibn Salama in 1248/9 (646 AH).

Raby suggested that Ibrahim ibn Mawaliya &quot;may have been a seminal figure&quot; in the Mosul brasswork industry. The particular phrasing of the &quot;benedictory inscriptions&quot; on his objects, bestowing good luck on their owners, is repeated in several works by other Mosul craftsmen. Two assistants of Ibrahim ibn Mawaliya&#x27;s are known: his &quot;tilmidh&quot; (apprentice) Isma&#x27;il ibn Ward, and his &quot;ghulam&quot; Qasim ibn Ali. Ahmad al-Dhaki&#x27;s workshop was possibly also &quot;intimately connected to others in Mosul&quot;.

The Mosul metalwork is the only example in the Muslim world where metalworkers recorded their relationships between masters and apprentices (&quot;tilmidh&quot;) and hirelings (&quot;ajir&quot;). This was apparently a point of pride for Mosul artisans. Julian Raby speculated that two elaborate but impractically tiny Mosuli objects, a tiny 6x4 cm box made by Isma&#x27;il ibn Ward and an anonymous 8-cm-tall bucket, were made as &quot;credential work&quot; by apprentice or journeyman metalworkers as part of a test to be accepted into a craftsman&#x27;s guild.

According to Raby, the Mosul metalwork may have been part of the gifts that Badr al-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27; gave to other rulers to appease them as part of his &quot;realpolitik&quot; diplomacy.

Another notable item tentatively attributed to Mosul metalworkers is the Courtauld bag, which is believed to be the world&#x27;s oldest surviving handbag. It was likely made for a noblewomen of the Ilkhanate during the early 1300s.

===Ottoman period===
What started as irregular attacks in 1517 were finalized in 1538, when Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent added Mosul to his empire by capturing it from his archrival, Safavid Persia. Thenceforth Mosul was governed by a pasha. Mosul was celebrated for its line of walls, comprising seven gates with large towers, a renowned hospital (&quot;maristan&quot;) and a covered market (&quot;qaysariyya&quot;), and its fabrics and flourishing trades.

Mesopotamia had been acquired by the Ottoman Empire in 1555 by the Peace of Amasya, but until the Treaty of Zuhab in 1639 Ottoman control over Mesopotamia was not decisive. After the Peace of Amasya, the Safavids recaptured most of Mesopotamia one more time during the reign of king Abbas I (r. 1588–1629). Among the newly appointed Safavid governors of Mesopotamia during those years was Qasem Sultan Afshar, who was appointed governor of Mosul in 1622. Before 1638, the Ottomans considered Mosul &quot;still a mere fortress, important for its strategic position as an offensive platform for Ottoman campaigns into Iraq, as well as a defensive stronghold and staging post guarding the approaches to Anatolia and to the Syrian coast. Then, with the Ottoman reconquest of Baghdad (1638), the liwa of Mosul became an independent wilaya.&quot;

Despite being a part of the Ottoman Empire, during the four centuries of Ottoman rule Mosul was considered &quot;the most independent district&quot; within the Middle East, following the Roman model of indirect rule through local notables. &quot;Mosuli culture developed less along Ottoman–Turkish lines than along Iraqi–Arab lines; and Turkish, the official language of the State, was certainly not the dominant language in the province.&quot;

In line with its status as a politically stable trade route between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf, Mosul developed considerably during the 17th and early 18th centuries. Like the development of the Mamluk dynasty in Baghdad, during this time &quot;the Jalili family was establishing itself as the undisputed master of Mosul&quot; and &quot;helping to connect Mosul with a pre-Ottoman, pre-Turcoman, pre-Mongol, Arab cultural heritage that was to put the town on its way to recapturing some of the prestige and prominence it had enjoyed under the golden reign of Badr ad-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;.&quot;

Along with the al-Umari and Tasin al-Mufti families, the Jalilis formed an &quot;urban-based small and medium gentry and a new landed elite&quot;, which proceeded to displace the control of previous rural tribes. Such families establish themselves through private enterprise, solidifying their influence and assets through rents on land and taxes on manufacturing.

As well as by elected officials, Mosul&#x27;s social architecture was highly influenced by the Dominican fathers who arrived in Mosul in 1750, sent by Pope Benedict XIV (Mosul had a large Christian population, predominantly indigenous Assyrians). In 1873 they were followed by the Dominican nuns, who established schools, health clinics, a printing press, an orphanage, and workshops to teach girls sewing and embroidery. A congregation of Dominican sisters founded in the 19th century still had its motherhouse in Mosul in the early 21st century. Over 120 Assyrian Iraqi Sisters belonged to this congregation.

In the 19th century the Ottoman government started to reclaim central control over its outlying provinces. Their aim was to &quot;restore Ottoman law, and rejuvenate the military&quot; and to revive &quot;a secure tax base for the government&quot;. In order to reestablish rule, in 1834 the sultan abolished public elections for governor, and began &quot;neutraliz[ing] local families such as the Jalilis and their class&quot; and appointing new, non-Maslawi governors directly. In line with its reintegration within central government rule, Mosul was required to conform to new Ottoman reform legislation, including the standardization of tariff rates, the consolidation of internal taxes and the integration of the administrative apparatus with the central government.

This process started in 1834 with the appointment of Bayraktar Mehmed Pasha, who was to rule Mosul for the next four years. After his reign, the Ottoman government (wishing still to restrain the influence of powerful local families) appointed a series of governors in rapid succession, ruling &quot;for only a brief period before being sent somewhere else to govern, making it impossible for any of them to achieve a substantial local power base.&quot; Mosul&#x27;s importance as a trading center declined after the opening of the Suez Canal, which enabled goods to travel to and from India by sea rather than by land through Mosul.
Mosul was the capital of Mosul Vilayet, one of the three vilayets (provinces) of Ottoman Iraq, with a brief break in 1623, when Persia seized the city.

===1918 to 1990s===
At the end of World War I in October 1918, after the Armistice of Mudros, British forces occupied Mosul. After the war, the city and surrounding area became part of the British-occupied Iraq (1918–1920) and then Mandatory Iraq (1920–1932). This mandate was contested by Turkey, which continued to claim the area on the grounds that it was under Ottoman control during the signature of the Armistice.

In the Treaty of Lausanne, the dispute over Mosul was left for future resolution by the League of Nations. In 1926, Iraq&#x27;s possession of Mosul was confirmed by the League of Nations&#x27; brokered agreement between Turkey and Great Britain. Former Ottoman Mosul Vilayet became the Nineveh Governorate of Iraq, but Mosul remained the provincial capital.
Mosul&#x27;s fortunes revived with the discovery of oil in the area, from the late 1920s onward. It became a nexus for the movement of oil via truck and pipeline to Turkey and Syria. Qyuarrah Refinery was built within about an hour&#x27;s drive from the city and was used to process tar for road-building projects. It was damaged but not destroyed during the Iran–Iraq War.

The opening of the University of Mosul in 1967 enabled the education of many in the city and surrounding area.
After Iraq&#x27;s 1991 uprisings, Mosul was included in the northern no-fly zone imposed and patrolled by the United States and Britain between 1991 and 2003.

Although this prevented Saddam&#x27;s forces from mounting large-scale military operations again in the region, it did not stop his regime from implementing a steady policy of &quot;Arabisation&quot; by which the demography of some areas of Nineveh Governorate were gradually changed. Despite this program, Mosul and its surrounding towns and villages remained home to a mixture of Arabs, Kurds, Assyrians, Armenians, Turkmens, Shabaks, a few Jews, and isolated populations of Yazidis, Mandeans, Kawliya and Circassians.

Saddam was able to garrison portions of the 5th Army within Mosul, had Mosul International Airport under military control, and recruited heavily from Mosul for his military&#x27;s officer corps. This may have been because most of the Iraqi Army officers and generals were from Mosul long before the Saddam regime.

===2003 American-led invasion===

When the 2003 invasion of Iraq was being planned, the United States had originally intended to base troops in Turkey and mount a thrust into northern Iraq to capture Mosul, but the Turkish parliament refused to grant permission for the operation. When the Iraq War broke out in March 2003, U.S. military activity in the area was confined to strategic bombing with airdropped special forces in the vicinity. Mosul fell on 11 April 2003, when the Iraqi Army 5th Corps, loyal to Saddam, abandoned the city and surrendered two days after the fall of Baghdad. U.S. Army Special Forces with Kurdish fighters quickly took civil control of the city. Thereafter began widespread looting before an agreement was reached to cede overall control to U.S. forces.

On 22 July 2003, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s sons, Uday Hussein and Qusay Hussein, were killed in a gun battle with Coalition forces in Mosul after a failed attempt at their capture. Mosul also served as the operational base for the US Army&#x27;s 101st Airborne Division during the occupational phase of the Operation Iraqi Freedom. During its tenure, the 101st Airborne Division was able to extensively survey the city and, advised by the 431st Civil Affairs Battalion, non-governmental organizations, and the people of Mosul, began reconstruction work by employing the people of Mosul in security, electricity, local governance, drinking water, wastewater, trash disposal, roads, bridges, and environmental concerns.

Other U.S. Army units to have occupied the city include the 4th Brigade Combat Team of the 1st Cavalry Division, the 172nd Stryker Brigade, the 3rd Brigade-2nd Infantry Division, 18th Engineer Brigade (Combat), Alpha Company 14th Engineer Battalion-555th Combat Engineer Brigade, 1st Brigade-25th Infantry Division, the 511th Military Police Company, the 812th Military Police Company and company-size units from Reserve components, an element of the 364th Civil Affairs Brigade, and the 404th Civil Affairs Battalion, which covered the areas north of the Green Line. The 67th Combat Support Hospital (CSH) deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) from January 2004 to January 2005, running split based operations in Mosul and Tikrit. The Task Force (TF) 67 Headquarters and Company B operated out of Forward Operating Base (FOB) Diamondback (Mosul), and Company A operating out of FOB Speicher (Tikrit).

On 24 June 2004, a coordinated series of car bombs killed 62 people, many of them policemen.

On 21 December 2004, 14 U.S. soldiers, four American employees of Halliburton, and four Iraqi soldiers were killed in a suicide attack on a dining hall at the Forward Operating Base (FOB) Marez next to the main U.S. military airfield at Mosul. The Pentagon reported that 72 other personnel were injured in the attack, carried out by a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest and the uniform of the Iraqi security services. The Islamist group Army of Ansar al-Sunna (partly evolved from Ansar al-Islam) took responsibility for the attack in an online statement.

In December 2007, Iraq reopened Mosul International Airport. An Iraqi Airways flight carried 152 Hajj pilgrims to Baghdad, the first commercial flight since U.S. forces declared a no-fly zone in 1993, though further commercial flight remained prohibited. On 23 January 2008, an explosion in an apartment building killed 36 people. The next day, a suicide bomber dressed as a police officer assassinated the local police chief, Brigadier General Salah Mohammed al-Jubouri, the director of police for Nineveh province, as he toured the site of the blast.

In May 2008, US-backed Iraqi Army Forces led by Major General Riyadh Jalal Tawfiq, the commander of military operations in Mosul, launched a military offensive of the Ninawa campaign in hopes of bringing stability and security to the city. The representatives of Mosul in the Iraqi Parliament, the intellectuals of the city, and other concerned humanitarian groups agreed on the pressing need for a solution to the city&#x27;s unbearable conditions, but still believed the solution was political and administrative. They also questioned whether such a large-scale military offensive would spare the lives of innocent people.

All these factors deprived the city of its historical, scientific and intellectual foundations between 2003 and 2008, when many scientists, professors, academics, doctors, health professionals, engineers, lawyers, journalists, religious clergy (both Muslim and Christian), historians, as well as professionals and artists, were either killed or forced to leave the city under the threat of being shot, exactly as happened elsewhere in Iraq in those years.

In 2008, many Assyrian Christians (about 12,000) fled the city, following a wave of murders and threats against their community. The murder of a dozen Assyrians, threats that others would be murdered unless they converted to Islam, and the destruction of their houses sparked a rapid exodus of the Christian population. Some fled to Syria and Turkey; others were given shelter in churches and monasteries. Accusations were exchanged between Sunni fundamentalists and some Kurdish groups of being behind this new exodus. Some claims linked it to the provincial elections of January 2009, and the related Assyrian Christians&#x27; demands for broader representation in the provincial councils.

===Government by the Islamic State===

Mosul was attacked on 4 June 2014. After six days of fighting, on 10 June the Islamic State took over the city during the June 2014 Northern Iraq offensive. By August, the city&#x27;s new ISIL administration was dysfunctional, with frequent power cuts, a tainted water supply, collapse of infrastructure, and failing health care.

On June 10, 2014, the Islamic State captured Mosul, after the Iraqi troops stationed there withdrew. Troop shortages and infighting among top officers and Iraqi political leaders played into ISIL&#x27;s hands and fueled panic that led to the city&#x27;s abandonment. Half a million people escaped on foot or by car during the next two days. According to western and pro-Iraqi government press, Mosul residents were de facto prisoners, forbidden to leave the city unless they left ISIL a significant collateral of family members, personal wealth and property. They could then leave after paying a significant &quot;departure tax&quot; for a three-day pass (for a higher fee they could surrender their home, pay the fee and leave for good) and if those with a three-day pass failed to return within that time, their assets would be seized and their family killed.

Ali Ghaidan, a former commander of the Iraqi ground forces, accused al-Maliki of being the one who issued the order to withdraw from the city. A short period of time after, Al-Maliki called for a national state of emergency on 10 June following the attack on Mosul, which had been seized overnight. Despite the security crisis, Iraq&#x27;s parliament did not allow Maliki to declare a state of emergency; many legislators boycotted the session because they opposed expanding the prime minister&#x27;s powers, since his reign has been described as sectarian by both Iraqis and western analysts, as well allegations of corruption, with hundreds of billions of dollars allegedly vanishing from government coffers.

After more than two years of ISIL occupation of Mosul, Iraqi forces, with the help of American and French forces, launched a joint offensive to recapture it on 16 October 2016. The battle for Mosul was considered key in the military intervention against ISIL. A military offensive to retake the city was the largest deployment of Iraqi forces since the 2003 invasion by U.S. and coalition forces On 9 July 2017, Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi arrived in preparation to announce the full liberation and reclamation of Mosul after three years of ISIL control. A formal declaration was made on the next day. The battle continued for another couple of weeks in the Old City before Iraqi forces regained full control of Mosul on 21 July 2017. According to Kurdish intelligence, tens of thousands of civilians were killed in the battle, and most of the city was destroyed by Coalition airstrikes and Iraqi shelling. Subsequently, Iranian-sponsored predominantly Shiite militias from the Popular Mobilization Units, which fought against ISIL, gained a foothold in the city.

==Demographics==
According to Salahuddin Khuda Bakhsh, the Arab geographer Ibn Hawqal was at Mosul in 969 AD (358 AH) He called it a &quot;fine town with excellent markets, surrounded by fertile districts of which the most celebrated was that round Nineveh where the Prophet Jonah was buried. In the tenth century, the population consisted of Kurds and Arabs, and the numerous districts round Mosul, occupying all Diyar Rabi&#x27;a, are carefully enumerated by Ibn Hawkal.&quot;

In the 20th century, Mosul was indicative of Iraq&#x27;s mingling ethnic and religious cultures, with a Kurdish majority.

Today Mosul has a Sunni Arab majority in urban areas, such as downtown Mosul west of the Tigris; across the Tigris and further north in the suburban areas, thousands of Assyrians, Kurds, Turkmens, Shabaks, Yazidis, Armenians and Mandeans made up the rest of Mosul&#x27;s population. Shabaks were concentrated on the city&#x27;s eastern outskirts.

===Religion===

Mosul has a predominantly Sunni Muslim population. The city also had an ancient Jewish population. Like their counterparts elsewhere in Iraq, most were forced out in 1950–51. Most Iraqi Jews have moved to Israel, and some to the United States. In 2003, during the Iraq War, a rabbi in the American army found an abandoned, dilapidated synagogue in Mosul dating to the 13th century.

During ISIL&#x27;s occupation, religious minorities were targeted to convert to Islam, pay tribute (&quot;jizya&quot;) money, leave, or be killed. The persecution of Christians in Mosul and the surrounding Nineveh Plains removed a Christian community that had been present in the region since the 1st century. 

==Infrastructure==
The Mosul Dam was built in the 1980s to supply Mosul with hydroelectricity and water. Despite this, water supply cuts are still common.

Five bridges cross the Tigris in Mosul, known from north to south as:
*Al Shohada Bridge (or &quot;Third Bridge&quot;)
*Fifth Bridge
*Old Bridge (or &quot;Iron Bridge&quot;, or &quot;First Bridge&quot;)
*Al Huriya Bridge (literally &quot;Freedom Bridge&quot;, also known as &quot;Second Bridge&quot;): located about 1 km north of the 4th bridge and 0.8 km south of the 1st bridge, the al-Huriya Bridge connects the neighborhoods of Bab at-Tawb on the west bank and al-Faisaliyyah on the east bank. It was built between 1955 and 1958 by German, French, and Dutch companies. Made of steel with concrete supports, the bridge has 6 spans and is 340 m long. A two-way street with one lane in each direction goes across the bridge, and there is also a sidewalk on both sides. Before the bridge&#x27;s destruction in 2016, an estimated 10,495 vehicles crossed the bridge per day, for a total of some 3.8 million vehicles per year. In October 2016, a US airstrike destroyed the bridge&#x27;s first span (starting from the left) along with the left-bank approach. Later, bombings by the Islamic State destroyed three more spans (the 4th, 5th, and 6th) and damaged the last two (2nd and 3rd spans). In the aftermath, Iraqi Army forces installed a temporary pontoon bridge 0.2 km north of the al-Huriya Bridge to provide an alternate route for commuters.
*Fourth Bridge
During the Battle of Mosul (2016–17) between ISIL and the Iraqi Army supported by an international coalition, two bridges were &#x27;damaged&#x27; by coalition airstrikes in October 2016, two others in November, and the Old Bridge was &#x27;disabled&#x27; in early December. According to the BBC, in late December the bridges were targeted to disrupt the resupply of ISIL forces in East Mosul from West Mosul. In January 2017, CNN reported that ISIL itself had &#x27;destroyed&#x27; all bridges to slow the Iraqi ground troops&#x27; advance, citing Iraqi commander Lieutenant General Abdul Amir Rasheed Yarallah.

During the last stages of the battle to retake Mosul, Lise Grande stated that per an initial assessment, basic infrastructure repair would cost over 1 billion USD. She stated that while stabilization in east Mosul could be achieved in two months, in some districts of Mosul it might take years, with six out of 44 districts almost completely destroyed. Every district of Mosul received light or moderate damage. Per the United Nations, 15 of the 54 residential districts in the western half of Mosul were heavily damaged while at least 23 were moderately damaged. Reconstruction has since become a multi-million dollar industry. To this day, large parts of the city are either being rebuilt or remain in ruins.

Mosul is served by Mosul International Airport.

== Geography ==

Mosul stands 223 meters above sea level in the Upper Mesopotamia region of the Middle East. To the south west of Mosul is the Syrian Desert and to the East is the Zagros Mountains. It is surrounded by the Nineveh Plains

=== Climate ===
Mosul has a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;), verging on the Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;), with extremely hot, prolonged, dry summers, brief mild shoulder seasons, and moderately wet (and occasionally snowy), relatively cool winters.

==Historical and religious buildings==
Mosul is rich in old historical places and ancient buildings: mosques, castles, churches, monasteries, and schools, many of which have architectural features and decorative work of significance. The town centre is dominated by a maze of streets and 19th-century houses. The markets are known for the mixture of people who jostle there: Arabs, Kurds, Assyrians, Iraqi Jews, Iraqi Turkmens, Armenians, Yazidi, Mandeans, Romani and Shabaks.

The Mosul Museum contains many finds from the ancient sites of the old Assyrian capital cities Nineveh and Nimrud. It is laid-out around a courtyard and with a façade of Mosul marble containing displays of Mosul life depicted in tableau form. On February 26, 2015, ISIL militants destroyed the museum&#x27;s ancient Assyrian artifacts.

The English writer Agatha Christie lived in Mosul while her second husband, Max Mallowan, an archaeologist, was involved in the excavation in Nimrud.

===Mosques and shrines===
* Umayyad Mosque: The first ever in the city, built in 640 AD by Utba bin Farqad al-Salami after he conquered Mosul in the reign of Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab. The only original part extant to recent times was the remarkably elaborate brickwork 52m high minaret that leans like the Leaning Tower of Pisa, called Al-Hadba (The Humped). It was largely destroyed during the Battle of Mosul.
* The Great (Nuriddin) Mosque: Built by Nuriddin Zangi in 1172 AD next door to the Umayyad Mosque. Ibn Battuta (the great Moroccan traveller) found a marble fountain there and a mihrab (the niche that indicates the direction of Mecca) with a Kufic inscription. It was destroyed during the Battle of Mosul.
* Mujahidi Mosque: The mosque dates back to 12th century AD, and is distinguished for its shen dome and elaborately wrought mihrab.
* Prophet Younis Mosque and Shrine: Located east of the city, and included the tomb of Prophet Younis (Jonah), dating back to the 8th century BC, with a tooth of the whale that swallowed and later released him. It was completely demolished by IS in July 2014.
* Prophet Jirjis Mosque and Shrine: The late 14th century mosque and shrine honoring Prophet Jirjis (George) was built over the Quraysh cemetery. It was destroyed by IS in July 2014.
* Prophet Daniel Shrine: A Tomb attributed to Prophet Daniel was destroyed by IS in July 2014.
* Hamou Qado (Hema Kado) Mosque: An Ottoman-era mosque in the central Maydan area built in 1881, and officially named Mosque of Abdulla Ibn Chalabi Ibn Abdul-Qadi. It was destroyed by IS in March 2015 because it contained a tomb that was revered and visited by local Muslims on Thursdays and Fridays.

===Churches and monasteries===

Mosul had the highest proportion of Assyrian Christians of all the Iraqi cities outside of the Kurdish region, and contains several interesting old churches, some of which originally date back to the early centuries of Christianity. Its ancient Assyrian churches are often hidden and their entrances in thick walls are not easy to find. Some of them have suffered from excessive restoration.
* Shamoun Al-Safa (St. Peter, Mar Petros): This church dates from the 13th century is and named after Shamoun Al-Safa or St. Peter (Mar Petros in Assyrian Aramaic). Earlier it had the name of the two Apostles, Peter and Paul, and was inhabited by the nuns of the Sacred Hearts.
* Church of St. Thomas (Mar Touma in Assyrian Aramaic): One of the oldest historical churches, named after St. Thomas the Apostle who preached the Gospel in the East, including India. The exact time of its foundation is unknown, but it was before 770 AD, since Al-Mahdi, the Abbasid Caliph, is mentioned as listening to a grievance concerning this church on his trip to Mosul.
* Mar Petion Church: Mar Petion, educated by his cousin in a monastery, was martyred in 446 AD. It is the first Chaldean Catholic church in Mosul, after the union of many Assyrians with Rome in the 17th century. It dates back to the 10th century, and lies 3 m below street level. This church suffered destruction, and it has been reconstructed many times. A hall was built on one of its three parts in 1942. As a result, most of its artistic features have been severely damaged.
* Ancient Tahira Church (The Immaculate): Near Bash Tapia, considered one of the most ancient churches in Mosul. No evidence helps to determine its exact area. It could be either the remnants of the church of the Upper Monastery or the ruined Mar Zena Church. Al-Tahira Church dates back to the 7th century, and it lies 3 m below street level. Reconstructed last in 1743.
* Al-Tahera Church: Syriac Catholic Church completed in 1862.
* Mar Hudeni Church: It was named after Mar Ahudemmeh (Hudeni) Maphrian of Tikrit who was martyred in 575 AD. Mar Hudeni is an old church of the Tikritans in Mosul. It dates back to the 10th century, lies 7 m below street level and was first reconstructed in 1970. People can get mineral water from the well in its yard. The chain, fixed in the wall, is thought to cure epileptics.
* St. George&#x27;s Monastery (Mar Gurguis): One of the oldest churches in Mosul, named after St. George, located to the north of Mosul, was probably built late in the 17th century. Pilgrims from different parts of the North visit it yearly in the spring, when many people also go out to its whereabouts on holiday. It is about 6 m below street level. A modern church was built over the old one in 1931, abolishing much of its archeological significance. The only monuments left are a marble door-frame decorated with a carved Estrangelo (Syriac) inscription, and two niches, which date back to the 13th or 14th century.
* Mar Matte: This monastery is situated about east of Mosul on the top of a high mountain (Mount Maqloub). It was built by Mar Matte, a monk who fled with several other monks in 362 AD from the Monastery of Zuknin near the City of Amid (Diyarbakir) in the southern part of Asia Minor (modern Turkey) and the north of Iraq during the reign of Emperor Julian the Apostate (361–363 AD). It has a precious library containing Syrianic scriptures.
* Monastery of Mar Behnam: Also called Deir Al-Jubb (The Cistern Monastery) and built in the 12th or 13th century, it lies in the Nineveh Plain near Nimrud about southwest of Mosul. The monastery, a great fort-like building, rises next to the tomb of Mar Behnam, a prince who was killed by the Sassanians, perhaps during the 4th century AD. A legend made him a son of an Assyrian king.
* St. Elijah&#x27;s Monastery (Dair Mar Elia): Dating from the 6th century, it was the oldest Christian Monastery in Iraq, until its destruction by IS in January 2016.

Other Christian historical buildings:
* The Roman Catholic Church (built by the Dominican Fathers in Nineveh Street in 1893)
* Mar Michael
* Mar Elias
* Mar Oraha
* Rabban Hormizd Monastery, the monastery of Notre-Dame des Semences, near the Assyrian town of Alqosh

===Other sites===
* Bash Tapia Castle: A ruined castle rising high over the Tigris, which was one of the few remnants of Mosul&#x27;s old walls until it was blown up by IS in 2015.
* Qara Saray (The Black Palace): The remnants of the 13th-century palace of Sultan Badruddin Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;.
* Ashur Mall is the largest mall of Mosul, based on Assyrian architecture

===Painting===

The so-called Mosul School of Painting refers to a style of miniature painting that developed in northern Iraq in the late 12th to early 13th century under the patronage of the Zangid dynasty (1127–1222). In technique and style the Mosul school was similar to the painting of the Seljuq Turks, who controlled Iraq at that time, but the Mosul artists had a sharper sense of realism based on the subject matter and degree of detail in the painting rather than on representation in three dimensions, which did not occur. Most of the Mosul iconography was Seljuq—for example, the use of figures seated cross-legged in a frontal position. Certain symbolic elements, however, such as the crescent and serpents, were derived from the classical Mesopotamian repertory.

Most Mosul paintings were manuscript illustrations—mainly scientific works, animal books, and lyric poetry. A frontispiece painting, now held in the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris, dating from a late 12th century copy of Galen&#x27;s medical treatise, the Kitab al-diriyak (&quot;Book of Antidotes&quot;), is a good example of the earlier work of the Mosul school. It depicts four figures surrounding a central, seated figure who holds a crescent-shaped halo. The painting is in a variety of whole hues; reds, blues, greens, and gold. The Küfic lettering is blue. The total effect is best described as majestic.

Another mid-13th century frontispiece held in the Nationalbibliothek, Vienna, to another copy of the same text suggests the quality of later Mosul painting. There is realism in its depiction of the preparation of a ruler&#x27;s meal and of horsemen engaged in various activities, and the painting is as many hued as that of the early Mosul school, yet it is somehow less spirited. The composition is more elaborate but less successful. By this time the Baghdad school, which combined the styles of the Syrian and early Mosul schools, had begun to dominate. With the invasion of the Mongols in the mid-13th century the Mosul school came to an end, but its achievements were influential in both the Mamluk and the Mongol schools of miniature painting.

==Education==

<text>Muslin () is a cotton fabric of plain weave. It is made in a wide range of weights from delicate sheers to coarse sheeting. It is commonly believed that it gets its name from the city of Mosul, Iraq.

Muslin was produced in different regions of the Indian subcontinent; Bengal Region was the main manufacturing area and the main centers were Sonargaon (near Dhaka), Shantipur and Murshidabad. Muslin was also produced in Malda and Hooghly. The muslin produced at Sonargaon and its surrounding areas was of excellent quality, which is popularly known as &quot;Dhaka Muslin&quot;. The muslin produced in Shantipur came to be known as &quot;Shantipuri Muslin&quot;, which was recognized by the East India Company. Muslin was made in Dhaka (Sonargaon) from very fine yarn, which is made from cotton called &quot;Phuti karpas&quot;; while in Malda, Radhanagar and Burdwan, muslin was made from fine yarn made from &quot;nurma&quot; or &quot;kaur&quot; cotton. A minimum of 300-count yarn was used for the muslin, making the muslin as transparent as glass. There were about 28 varieties of muslin, of which jamdani is still widely used. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Mughal Bengal emerged as the foremost muslin exporter in the world, with Dhaka as capital of the worldwide muslin trade. In the latter half of the 18th century, muslin weaving ceased in Bengal due to cheap fabrics from England and oppression by the colonialists.

In India in the latter half of the 20th century and in Bangladesh in the second decade of the 21st century, initiatives were taken to revive muslin weaving, and the industry was able to be revived. &quot;Dhakai Muslin&quot; was recognized as a Geographical Indication (GI) product of Bangladesh in 2020 and &quot;Banglar Muslin&quot; (Bengal Muslin) was recognized as a Geographical Indication (GI) product of the Indian state of West Bengal in 2024. In 2013, Jamdani (a type of muslin) weaving art of Bangladesh included in the list of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO under the title &quot;Traditional art of Jamdani Weaving&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The dictionary &quot;Hobson Jobson&quot; published by two Englishmen named S.C. Burnell and Henry Yule mentions that the word muslin comes from &#x27;Mosul&#x27;—a famous trading center and city in Iraq. Mosul produced a very fine cloth, which became known as muslin in Europe.

== History ==
=== Early period ===
The earliest specimen of Indian fine cotton cloth (like muslin) was found in Egypt as a mummy shroud around 2000 BC. The first commercial mention of Indian cotton is found in &quot;The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; (63 AD). The book mentions the export of fine cotton textiles from different parts of India to Europe. The eastern (Bengal) and north-western regions of India produced large quantities of fine cotton cloth, but Bengal cotton cloth was superior in quality. According to the text, European merchants procured fine cotton fabrics from the &quot;Gange&quot; port of Bengal. In this text, broad and smooth cotton cloth is referred to as &quot;Monachi&quot; and the finest cotton cloth is called &quot;Gangetic&quot;. A kingdom called &#x27;Ruhma&#x27; is found in the &quot;Sulaiman al-Tajir&quot; written by the 9th century Arab merchant Sulaiman, where fine cotton fabrics was produced. There were cotton fabrics so fine and delicate that a single piece of cloth could be easily moved through the ring. Very fine cotton cloth was made in Mosul in the 12th century and later. Arab traders carried it to Europe as a commodity, and enchanted Europeans called it muslin; since then the very fine and beautiful cotton cloth came to be known as muslin. In 1298 AD, Marco Polo described in his book &quot;The Travels&quot; that muslin is made in Mosul, Iraq. Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan traveler who came to Bengal in the middle of the 14th century, praised the cotton cloth made in Sonargaon in his book &quot;The Rihla&quot;. Chinese writers who came to Bengal in the fifteenth century praised cotton cloth.

=== Mughal period ===

The muslin industry flourished in Bengal between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries. The main muslin production centers in Bengal during this period were Dhaka and its surrounding areas, Shantipur, Malda and Hooghly. The 16th-century English traveller Ralph Fitch lauded the muslin he saw in Sonargaon. He visited India in 1583, described Sonargaon, &quot;as a town ... where there is the best and finest cloth made in all India&quot;. During the reign of Emperor Jahangir, Islam Khan Chishti shifted the capital from Rajmahal to Dhaka in 1610 AD, Dhaka gained prominence as the center of trade and commerce of Bengal. During this period the muslin produced in Dhaka achieved excellence, and the muslin produced here became world famous as &quot;Dhakai muslin&quot;. Mughal Emperor Akbar&#x27;s courtier, Abul Fazal, praised the fine cotton fabric produced in Sonargaon (near Dhaka). Abul Fazl wrote &quot;the Sarkar of Sonargaon produces a species of muslin very fine and in great quantity&quot;. European traders began arriving in the Bengali capital of Dhaka in the early seventeenth century, and these traders procured cotton cloth and muslin from Bengal for export to Europe.

After the establishment of Murshidabad as the capital of Bengal, Cossimbazar—a small town on the banks of the Bhagirathi south of Murshidabad city, now included in the Baharampur municipality—became the center of a silk and cotton textile trade. The branch of the Bhagirathi that joined the Jalangi was called Cossimbazar river, and the triangular land surrounded by the Padma, Bhagirathi and Jalangi was called Cossimbazar Island. It was a major trading center for muslin and silk and a trading post (&quot;kuthi&quot;) of various European merchants. In 1670 AD, Streynsham Master mention that muslin was produced at Malda, Shantipur, Hooghly etc. Advaitacharya Goswami&#x27;s &quot;Shantipur Parichaẏa&quot;, Volume II mentions that the East India Company purchased £150,000 worth of muslin annually in the early 19th century.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, Mughal Bengal emerged as the foremost muslin exporter in the world, with Mughal Dhaka as capital of the worldwide muslin trade. It became highly popular in 18th-century France and eventually spread across much of the Western world. Dhaka muslin was first showcased in the UK at The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations in 1851.

=== Decline under Company rule ===
During the period of Company rule, the East India Company imported British-produced cloth into the Indian subcontinent, but became unable to compete with the local muslin industry. The Company administration initiated several policies in an attempt to suppress the muslin industry, and muslin production subsequently experienced a period of decline. It has been alleged that in some instances Indian weavers were rounded up and their thumbs chopped off, although this has been refuted by historians as a misreading of a report by William Bolts from 1772. Many of the threatened weavers fled East Bengal (present-day Bangladesh) and settled in the eastern districts of West Bengal, these districts were famous for the cotton products of Bengal. The quality, fineness and production volume of Bengali muslin declined as a result of these policies, continuing when India transitioned from Company rule to British Crown control.

=== Revive: 1950s–present ===

==== India ====
To revive Bengal muslin, two muslin production centers were set up by the Khadi and Rural Industries Commission, one at Basowa in Birbhum district of West Bengal, and the other at Panduru in Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh. Under the patronage of former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Kalicharan Sharma took the lead in reviving the lost fame of muslin in Basowa, Birbhum district of West Bengal, with the help of some spinners. He soon found the dry climate of Birbhum quite unsuitable for spinning muslin yarn. Later he shifted his work center to the neighboring district of Murshidabad, and chose Chowk Islampur as the site of this weaving industry. Chowk Islampur, situated on the banks of the Bairab River, a tributary of the Padma, is an ancient village famous for spinning and weaving since the days of the East India Company. After India&#x27;s independence, the village had already gained a reputation for high-quality silk weaving. A muslin training center was started at Chowk Islampur in 1955 under the supervision of Kalicharan Sharma.

At first experiments were started on spinning yarn with traditional &quot;Kishan Charkha&quot;, but it was not possible to make more than 250 counts on this traditional Charkha. Kalicharan Sharma did further experiments and research and developed a highly sensitive six spindle &quot;Ambar Charkha&quot; (spinning wheel) capable of spinning 500 count yarn. This new Charkha was able to reduce the cost of production and increase the wages of spinners. The use of this &quot;ambar Charkha&quot; proved to be effective and promising for the regeneration of muslin. To concentrate on muslin spinning, the Khadi Society constructed a separate spacious two-storied building at Berhampore in 1966.

The Government of West Bengal launched &quot;Project Muslin&quot; in 2013 with Khadi. The aim in this initiative was to revive the muslin fabric and support the weavers. Through this project, weavers from Murshidabad, Nadia, Maldah, Burdwan, Birbhum, Hooghly and Jhargram districts who are capable of weaving muslin cloth were identified. All these weavers are provided training and technical assistance to produce high quality muslin. Weavers are capable of producing 500 counts of muslin; Some weavers have been able to weave 700 count muslin. Project Muslin was able to expand the production of muslin in different parts of West Bengal. Muslin products produced in West Bengal include handkerchiefs, &quot;dhoti&quot;, bed sheets and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s clothing. According to 2015 data, the products were priced between ₹400 and ₹25,000, while some premium sarees in this category were priced between ₹70,000 and ₹150,000.

==== Bangladesh ====

In the second decade of the 21st century, a scheme called &quot;Bangladesh Golden Heritage Muslin Yarn Manufacturing Technology and Muslin Cloth Restoration&quot; was undertaken to restore and develop the muslin production system in Bangladesh. Under this project, samples of muslin from different countries including India, Britain were inspected and data collected. Old maps of the Meghna River were examined and combined with modern satellite imagery to identify possible locations – where phuti carpus plants could still be found. From there, the genetic sequences of the recovered cotton plants were made and compared with the original ones. After testing, a carpus plant was identified, which was 70 percent identical to the Futi carpus. An island in the Meghna, 30 km north of Dhaka, was selected for the production of this corpus, where some seeds were sown experimentally in 2015, and the first cotton was harvested that year. But at that time there were no skilled spinners in Bangladesh to produce fine yarn, on the other hand Indian spinners were able to produce 200-300-400-500 count fine yarn from cotton. As a result, in joint venture with Indian spinners, a hybrid yarn of 200 and 300 count was produced by combining common and futi corpus cotton. At least 50 tools were needed to make cloth from yarn, which had to be reinvented, as they disappeared with muslin. Ultimately a weaver is able to weave a saree with a thread count of 300, which is nowhere near the quality of real &quot;Dhaka muslin&quot;; But much better quality than what the weavers of many generations past have woven.

The Bangladesh Handloom Board (BHB) is implementing the first phase of the project titled &quot;Bangladesh&#x27;s Golden Heritage Muslin Yarn Manufacturing Technology and Muslin Cloth Reviving&quot;, and the Revival work was completed in 2020. &quot;Dhakai Muslin&quot; was recognized as a GI (Geographical Indication) product on 28 December 2020. The Government of Bangladesh declared official revival of fine Dhaka Muslin in April 2022.

In 2022, the Dhakai Muslin House was built on the banks of Shitalakshya river at Rupganj under Tarab municipality of Narayanganj district. The second phase of the project named ‘Dhaka Muslin Commercialization’ begins in 2023.

== Manufacturing process ==
Since all the processes were manual, manufacturing involved many artisans for yarn spinning and weaving activities, but the leading role lay with the material and weaving.

* Ginning: For removing trash and cleaning and combing the fibers and making them parallel ready for spinning a &quot;boalee&quot; (upper jaw of a catfish) was used.
* Spinning and weaving: For extra humidity they used to weave during the rainy season for elasticity in the yarns and to avoid breakages. The process was so sluggish that it could take over five months to weave one piece of muslin.

== Characteristics ==
=== Thin ===
Muslins were originally made of cotton only. These were very thin, transparent, delicate and feather light breathable fabrics. There could be 1000–1800 yarns in warp and weigh for . Some varieties of muslin were so thin that they could even pass through the aperture of a lady&#x27;s finger-ring.

=== Transparency ===
Gaius Petronius Arbiter (1st century AD Roman courtier and author of the &quot;Satyricon&quot;) described the transparent nature of the muslin cloth as below:
=== Poetic names ===
Certain delicate muslins were given poetic names such as &quot;Baft Hawa&quot; (&quot;woven air&quot;), &quot;Shabnam&quot; (&quot;evening dew&quot;), and &quot;āb-i-ravān&quot; (&quot;flowing water&quot;). The latter name refers to a fine and transparent variety of fine muslin from Dacca. The fabric&#x27;s characteristics are summed up in its name.

=== Types ===
Muslin has several kinds of variations. Many of the below are mentioned in Ain-i-Akbari (16th-century detailed document) 
*&quot;Khasa&quot; 
*&quot;Tansukh&quot; 
*&quot;Nainsook&quot;
*&quot;Chautar&quot; 
*Alliballi The name embraces , &#x27;superior&#x27;, , &#x27;good&#x27;.
*Adatais, a fine and clear fabric.
*Seerhand muslin was a variety in between nainsook and mull (another muslin type, a very thin and soft). The fabric was resistant to washing, retaining its clearness.
*and varieties of mulmul (Mulboos khas, Jhuna, &quot;Sarkar ali, Sarbati, Tarindam&quot;) were among the most delicate cotton muslins produced in the Indian subcontinent.

====More variations====
Mull is another kind of muslin. It is a soft, thin, and semitransparent material. The name is derived from Hindi which means &quot;soft&quot;. Swiss mull is a type of which is finished with stiffening agents.

== Uses ==
=== Dressmaking and sewing ===

Because muslin is an inexpensive, unbleached cotton fabric available in different weights, it is often used as a backing or lining for quilts, and therefore can often be found in wide widths in the quilting sections of fabric stores.

When sewing clothing, a dressmaker may test the fit of a garment by using muslin fabric to make a test-model before cutting pieces from more expensive fabric to make the final product, thereby avoiding potential costly mistakes. In the United States, these test-models are themselves sometimes referred to as &quot;muslins&quot;, the process is called &quot;making a muslin&quot;, and &quot;muslin&quot; has become the generic term for any test- or fitting garment, regardless of the fabric it is made from.

In Britain and Australia, the term for a test- or fitting garment used to be Toile. The word &quot;toile&quot;, from an Old French word for &quot;cloth&quot;, entered the English language around the 12th century. (Today, &quot;toile&quot; simply refers to any sheer fabric, which may be made, for example, from linen or cotton.)

The modern German term for a test- or fitting garment is &quot;Nesselmodell&quot;.

=== Use in food production ===

Muslin can be used as a filter:
* In a funnel when decanting fine wine or port to prevent sediment from entering the decanter
* To separate liquid from mush (for example, to make apple juice: wash, chop, boil, mash, then filter by pouring the mush into a muslin bag suspended over a jug)
* To retain a liquidy solid (for example, in home cheese-making, when the milk has curdled to a gel, pour into a muslin bag and squash between two saucers (upside down under a brick) to squeeze out the liquid whey from the cheese curd)
* Muslin is a filter in traditional Fijian kava production.

Muslin is the material for the traditional cloth wrapped around a Christmas pudding. It is the fabric wrapped around the items in barmbrack, a fruitcake traditionally eaten at Halloween in Ireland. Beekeepers use muslin to filter melted beeswax to clean it of particles and debris.

=== Set design and photography ===
Muslin is often the cloth of choice for theatre sets. It is used to mask the background of sets and to establish the mood or feel of different scenes. It receives paint well and, if treated properly, can be made translucent.

It also holds dyes well. It is often used to create nighttime scenes because when dyed, it often gets a wavy look with the color varying slightly, such that it resembles a night sky. Muslin shrinks after it is painted or sprayed with water, which is desirable in some common techniques such as soft-covered flats.

In video production, muslin is used as a cheap greenscreen or bluescreen, either pre-colored or painted with latex paint (diluted with water).

Muslin is the most common backdrop material used by photographers for formal portrait backgrounds. These backdrops are usually painted, most often with an abstract mottled pattern.

In the early days of silent film-making, and until the late 1910s, movie studios did not have the elaborate lights needed to illuminate indoor sets, so most interior scenes were sets built outdoors with large pieces of muslin hanging overhead to diffuse sunlight.

&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; features a sequence with a tornado constructed out of muslin, measuring 35-foot-high.

=== Medicine ===
Surgeons use muslin gauze in cerebrovascular neurosurgery to wrap around aneurysms or intracranial vessels at risk for bleeding. The thought is that the gauze reinforces the artery and helps prevent rupture. It is often used for aneurysms that, due to their size or shape, cannot be microsurgically clipped or coiled.

== Recognition ==
Many travelers and merchants of the 13th and 14th centuries praised Bengal muslin, and claimed it as the best muslin. From the Mughal rulers to the European colonial rulers, Bengal&#x27;s muslins were recognized for their superiority, with the muslins produced at Sonargaon being the best.

In 2013, the traditional art of Jamdani weaving in Bangladesh was included in the list of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. In 2020, &quot;Dhakai muslin&quot; was given Geographical indication status as a product of Bangladesh. In 2024, &quot;Banglar Muslin&quot; (or Bengal Muslin) was granted Geographical Indication status as a product of West Bengal.

<doc id="200491" wikidata="Q2664013" url="?curid=200491" title="List of legendary kings of Denmark">
<text>The legendary kings of Denmark were, according to legend, the monarchs of Denmark, the Danes, or specific lands of Denmark (Zealand, Jutland or Scania) who preceded Gorm the Old, a king who reigned to and is the earliest reliably attested Danish ruler. Gorm&#x27;s son, Harald Bluetooth, oversaw the widespread Christianization of Denmark, meaning that the legendary kings listed here are those from before Christianization and are predominantly (but not entirely) pagan. Earlier kings may be partly historical (especially those near to Gorm&#x27;s time), but are either semi-legendary or entirely mythological. Some are based on earlier euhemerised stories (that is, figures from mythological folktales were depicted as historical kings by medieval writers such as Saxo Grammaticus).

There are many medieval accounts of the Danish kings of the Dark Ages, and these accounts can be confusing and contradictory (although there is overlap and different sources can include the same kings). This article presents the legendary kings from each source separately.

==Danish sources==

=== Adam of Bremen ===
Adam of Bremen was an 11th century German chronicler. Although not Danish himself, he spent time in the court of the Danish king Svend Estridson. Adam claims to derive much of the information on Danish history from his Latin chronicle &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; (&quot;Deeds of the Bishops of Hamburg&quot;) from conversations with Svend (whom he quotes verbatim in several places) and from information provided by Danish bishops. He also references the historians of the Franks (see, for example, the section on the Royal Frankish Annals, below) and hagiographies such as &quot;Vita Ansgarii&quot;.

&quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; names several 10th century kings preceding Gorm the Old. Kings whose histories are derived from information provided by Svend Estridson include:
* Helge (&quot;Heiligonem&quot;), who ruled Norway after the defeat of the Norsemen and was renowned for his justice and sanctity &quot;(1.XLVIII)&quot;
* Olaf (&quot;Olaph&quot;), a Swedish prince who conquered Denmark, succeeded Helge, and had many sons &quot;(1.XLVIII, 1.LII)&quot;
* Chnuba and Gyrd (&quot;Chnob et Gurd&quot;), Olaf&#x27;s sons who possessed the realm after his death &quot;(1.XLVIII)&quot;
* Sigeric (&quot;Sigerich&quot;), who succeeded after Olaf and his sons &quot;(1.LII)&quot;
* Harthacnut (&quot;Hardegon&quot;, &quot;Hardecnudth&quot;), the son of &quot;Svein&quot;; Harthacnut came from &quot;Nortmannia&quot; and deprived Sigeric of the kingdom &quot;(1.LII, 1.LV)&quot;

Mentioned kings preceding Gorm the Old, whose histories are derived from other sources, include:
* Gotafrid &quot;(1.xiv, 1.xxxix)&quot;
* Hemming, Gotafrid&#x27;s cousin who succeeded him &quot;(1.xiv)&quot;
* Sigefrid and Anulo, Gotafrid&#x27;s nephews who went to war with each other over Hemming&#x27;s succession. Both kings were killed, but Anulo&#x27;s faction won and placed Reginfrid and Harald on the throne. &quot;(1.xv, 1.xxxix)&quot;
* Reginfrid, who was forced out of Denmark by his brother Harald and resorted to piracy &quot;(1.xv)&quot;
* Harald (i.e. Harald Klak), who was forced out by the sons of Gotafrid and fled to the court of Louis the Pious, where he (with his wife and brother Horuch) were converted to Christianity and baptised &quot;(1.xv)&quot;
* Horic, who was friendly to Christians, and who was killed in a war against his nephew Gudorm &quot;(1.xxv, 1.xxvi, 1.xxviii)&quot;
* Horic the younger, the only royal survivor of the war between Horic the elder and Gudorm. On his ascension to the throne, he immediately expelled all Christian priests and closed the churches, but was later converted to Christianity by Ansgar. &quot;(1.xxviii, 1.xxix)&quot;
* Sigefrid and his brother Halfdan &quot;(1.xxxvii)&quot;
* Horic &quot;(1.xxxvii)&quot;
* Orwig &quot;(1.xxxvii)&quot;
* Gotafrid &quot;(1.xxxvii)&quot;
* Rudolf &quot;(1.xxxvii)&quot;
* Ingvar, son of Lodbrok (possibly a conflation of Ivar the Boneless, one of Ragnar Lodbrok&#x27;s sons who is not traditionally credited with ruling Denmark, with Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, who is) &quot;(1.xxxvii)&quot;
* Wrm (i.e. Gorm the Old, rendered in various manuscripts as &quot;Vurm&quot;, &quot;Wrm&quot;, &quot;Worm&quot;, &quot;Gorm&quot;, or &quot;Gwyrm&quot;), son of Harthacnut; described by Adam of Bremen as a &quot;wyrm&quot; who tried to eradicate Christianity in Denmark, but was succeeded by his son Harold who converted the country to that religion &quot;(1.LV, 1.LVII, 1.LVIIII, 1.LIX)&quot;

=== &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;===

The earliest known chronicle of Danish kings to be written in Denmark was &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; (&quot;The Chronicle of Lejre&quot;), which was composed by an unknown author, likely from Roskilde and transmitted as part of the &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot; (although it was likely originally a separate work). &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; was written in the mid- to late-12th century, possibly alongside or as a sort of prequel to &quot;Chronicon Roskildense&quot;, which depicts historical kings after the Christianization of Denmark.

&quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; was hugely influential, and many subsequent chronicles were at least partly based on it. Almost all monarchs mentioned appear in subsequent chronicles, with the notable exception of two queens regnant, Asa and Hethae. It states that the first king of the Danes was a certain Dan (after whom the tribe was named), who was the son of a Swedish king named Ypper. This is said to be both when Augustus invaded Denmark and during the time of the Biblical King David, referring to two rulers who lived about a thousand years apart.

&quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; also explicitly conflates the kingdoms of Denmark with Dacia, a conceit that appears in the earlier works of Dudo of Saint-Quentin, and in subsequent works such as &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (see below).

Monarchs in the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; are:
* Dan, son of Ypper (a primeval king of Sweden)
* Ro (= Haldan)
* Haldanus (= Ro) in Lejre and sea-king Helghe, the sons of Ro (= Haldan)
* A dog king Raki, Rachus or Saurr ruled Denmark on the order of the Swedish king Adils (or Hakon)
* Snyo
* Rolf Kraki
* Hiarwart
* Aki, brother of Haghbardus and son of Hamundus
* Fritleff
* Frotha Largus (the Generous)
* Ingyald
* Olavus, who is described here as the son of Ingyald and not a conqueror as in other chronicles
* Asa, queen
* Haraldus Hyldetan
* Hethae, queen who founded Hethaeby in Jutland

=== Sven Aggesen ===

Sven Aggesen was a 12th century Danish chronicler who wrote &quot;Brevis historia regum Dacie&quot; (&quot;A Short History of the Kings of Denmark&quot;). He was a contemporary of Saxo Grammaticus and noted in his writings that he was aware of Saxo&#x27;s then-in progress work on the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (see below), but also described himself (incorrectly) as the first writer to document the kings of Denmark.

Sven says that the first king of Denmark was Skiold, whose descendants are the Skioldungar. The line of kings continues from Skiold to Gorm the Old with only one break, between Ingiald and Olaf. It says, &quot;After his [Ingeld&#x27;s] time no son succeeded his father to the throne for a space of many centuries. It passed to grandsons, or nephews, who, to be sure, were sprung from the royal stock on the one side.&quot; It is unclear if this represents a gap in the lineage (i.e. that other unmentioned kings ruled between Ingeld and Olaf) or if Olaf succeeded Ingeld directly but began a period in which there was no direct father-to-son succession. The latter is possible given, for example, that Olaf took the throne by conquest, and that after Olaf the landowner Ennignup (possibly a reference to Gnupa) became guardian of the kingdom before Knut came to power. When first written, the chronicle was apparently accompanied by an extensive genealogy as an appendix, but this appendix has not survived.

=== &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; ===

&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (&quot;Deeds of the Danes&quot;) by Saxo Grammaticus is the most extensive, and most widely known Danish chronicle of Danish kings. It was written in Latin in the 12th century, and comprises 16 books, of which the first 9 relate to legendary kings leading up to Gorm the Old, and the remaining 7 are more recent and historical. The work is explicitly euhemeristic, repeatedly referring to certain individuals (including Odin, Baldr, and Thor) as mortal humans that people believed to be, and worshipped as, gods.

Saxo draws on many sources for this work. In several places where the sources appear contradictory, he will adapt more than one version at different places in the timeline, often creating multiple individuals where earlier stories had only one. For example, instead of a single king named Gorm the Old, Saxo says there were three different kings named Gorm. Sigurd Hring appears as two different kings, Ringo and Siwardus Ring.

Other Danish kings include:

* Hadingus
* Frotho I
* Haldanus I
* Ro
* Helgo
* Rolvo Krake
* Høtherus (and Balderus)
* Rørikus (the grandfather of Hamlet)
* Wiglecus
* Wermundus
* Uffo
* Dan II
* Huglecus
* Frotho II
* Dan III
* Hiarnus
* Fridlevus I
* Frotho III
* Fridlevus II
* Frotho IV
* Ingellus
* Olavus I
* Haraldus I
* Frotho V
* Haldanus II
* Yngwin
* Sywaldus I
* Sygarus
* Haraldus Hyldetan (Harald Wartooth)
* Ringo
* Olo
* Omundus
* Sywardus I
* Iarmericus
* Broderus
* Sywaldus II
* Snio
* Biorn
* Haraldus III
* Gormo I
* Gudfred
* Olavus II
* Hemmingus
* Siwardus Ring
* Regner Lothbrog
* Siwardus III
* Ericus I
* Ericus II
* Kanutus I
* Frotho VI
* Gormo II
* Haraldus III
* Gormo III
In Book VI of &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, Saxo also refers to a certain Hakon as the tyrant of Denmark when describing the early years of the champion Starkad. However, Hakon does not appear to fit into the timeline or family tree of Danish rulers as described in the rest of &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;.

===&quot;Gesta Danorum på danskæ&quot;===
&quot;Gesta Danorum på danskæ&quot;, a work separate from Saxo&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, is the earliest surviving chronicle of Danish kings that was written in the Danish language (then Old Norse). It is often referred to incorrectly as the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; in its English translation by Peter Tunstall. This work is based on the kings list from the Codex Runicus, and includes kings not in the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, such as:
* Wig
* Aki
* Hother of Saxland, son of Hodbrod and Hadding&#x27;s daughter, as nearest heir.
* Rorik Slengeborre or Rake
* Wighlec
* Wermund
* Offe the Strong

== Anglo-Saxon sources ==
===&quot;Beowulf&quot; ===
The Old English epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; mentions several Danish kings, in particular Hroðgar, whose hall Heorot is the main setting of the tale.
* Heremod, a Danish king
* Scyld, a foundling who became king
* Scealdwea (Scealdea), son of Heremod
* Beowa, son of Scyld
* Healfdene, son of Beowa
* Heorogar, son of Healfdene
* Hroðgar, son of Healfdene
* Hroðulf, probably the son of Hroðgar&#x27;s brother Halga

&quot;Beowulf&quot; also refers to a rival family of rules called the Heaðobards, who are not kings of Denmark in this work but are depicted as kings of Denmark when they appear in later surviving works from the continent. These are:
* Fróði, who killed or was killed by Healfdene
* Ingeld, Fróði&#x27;s son, who married Hroðgar&#x27;s daughter Freawaru in an attempt to settle the feud between their families, but would turn against Hroðgar after the events of the poem

===&quot;Widsith&quot;===
&quot;Widsith&quot; is an Old English poem that survives in the 10th century Exeter Book, but may significantly predate it. The first of three thulas in the poem presents a list of kings, the most notable example of a king from each of several tribes. The thula says that Alewih was known as king of the Danes, and describes him as the bravest of all men listed but that he was defeated by Offa, ruler of the Angles. The thula also lists Sigehere as ruler of the &quot;Sea-Danes&quot;.

&quot;Widsith&quot; also mentions Hroðulf (&quot;Hroþwulf&quot;) and Hroðgar as an uncle and nephew who held the longest peace together, and Ingeld as a Heaðobard Viking (&quot;wicinga cynn&quot;) whom they defeated at Heorot. None of these three are explicitly mentioned as Danish in &quot;Widsith&quot;, but appear as Danish in other works (see the section of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, above).

==Icelandic sources==
=== &quot;Gróttasöngr&quot; ===
&quot;Gróttasöngr&quot; (&quot;Grótti&#x27;s song&quot;) is an Eddic poem that survives only in certain manuscripts of Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, and as such as not always included in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. The song is sung by two slave-girls, Fenja and Menja, who later identify themselves as the kin of bergrisi (jötnar). They are the slaves of King Fróði, son of Friðleifr. The poem itself does not specify that these men were kings of Denmark, but Snorri&#x27;s prose introduction to the poem (in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;) says that Friðleifr was the son of Skjöldr (himself a son of Odin), whose lands &quot;were in what is now [i.e. in Snorri&#x27;s time] called Denmark, but was then known as Gotland&quot;. The prose introduction also says that Fróði&#x27;s reign coincided with the reign of Caesar Augustus and the birth of Christ; in Scandinavia, the resulting peace was ascribed to Fróði and known as Fróði&#x27;s Peace.

A later stanza of &quot;Gróttasöngr&quot; prophesies that &quot;Yrsa&#x27;s son&quot; (identified in other works as Hrólfr Kraki) would take vengeance on Fróði for the killing of Hálfdan (or, as plural, the half-Danes). (Halfdan is the name of several Danish kings in other sources.)

*Skjöldr
*Friðleifr
*Fróði

=== Skjöldunga saga (partial list) ===
The kings of the saga of the Scylding family.
* Scioldus
* Fridleifus I
* Frodo I
* Herleifus
* Havardus
* Leifus
* Herleifus
* Hunleifus
* Aleifus
* Oddleifus
* Geirleifus
* Gunnleifus
* Frodo II
* Vermundus
* Dan I
* Dan II
* Frodo III
* Fridleifus II
* Frodo IV
* Ingjaldus 
* Helgo and Roas
* Rolfo Krake
* Hiorvardus
* Rærecus
=== &quot;Sögubrot&quot; ===
Sögubrot or &quot; Sǫgubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum Dana ok svíaveldi &quot; is an Old Icelandic saga fragment which is believed to be a part of the original Skjöldunga saga. The fragment begins in the middle of a discussion between the Scanian king Ivar Vidfamne and his daughter Auðr.

Kings of the whole of Denmark or individual Danish regions, which appear in Sögubrot:
* Helgi, (joint ?) king of Zealand
* Hrœrekr Ringslinger (brother of Helgi), king / (co-kingship) of Zealand
* Ivar Vidfamne (the father-in-law of Hrœrekr), King of Scania – later King of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and parts of several adjoining countries.
* Harald Wartooth (grandson of Ivar), he became king after Ivar (possibly identical with the &quot;former&quot; or &quot;senior&quot; King Harald mentioned in connection with the royal Danish brothers Anulo and Harald in the &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot;)
* Hring or Sigurd Hring (nephew of Harald Wartooth), at first king of Sveariket (Beowulf: &quot;Swēorice&quot;; oldest Swedish form: &quot;Swerike&quot;), later also king of Denmark (could possibly be identical with king Sigfred).
* At the end of Sögubrot is mentioned Ragnar (Ragnarr) as a son of Sigurd Hring. From other known sources it must be concluded that this Ragnarr is the famous Viking king Ragnar Lodbrok.

=== &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; ===
The kings of the saga of the Ynglinga family.
* Skjöldr
* Frið-Fróði
* Danr hinn mikilláti
* Fróði hinn mikilláti eða friðsami
* Hálfdan
* Friðleifr
* Áli hinn frækni
* Fróði hinn frækni
* Helgi Hálfdanarson
* Hrólfr kraki

== Other sources ==
===Histories of the Franks===
The 6th century historian Gregory of Tours, in Book 3 of his &quot;Historia Francorum&quot; (&quot;History of the Franks&quot;), refers to a Danish king named Chlochilaicus, who led a raid into the Frankish Kingdoms during the reign of Theodericus I (511 to 534), and was killed in the counter-attack by Theodericus&#x27; son, Theodebertus. The 8th century &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot; tells the same story, referring to the Danish King as Chochilaicus. (The same story also appears in the 7th or 8th century &quot;Liber Monstrorum&quot; and in the poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, but in these works the raiding Viking king is named Hygelac, and described as King of the Geats rather than King of the Danes.)

&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; refers to two characters named Huglecus, one as King of the Danes (see above), and another in Book VI as a King of the Irish who was attacked and defeated by the Danish forces of Hakon and Starkad.

===&quot;The Life of Willibrord&quot;===
The &quot;Vita Willibrordi archiepiscopi Traiectensis&quot;, or &quot;The Life of Willibrord, Archbishop of Utrecht&quot;, is a late 8th century hagiography of Willibrord, written by the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin. This work relates how Willibrord became a missionary to the Danes and met their ruler, Ongendus, described as &quot;a man more savage than any wild beast and harder than stone&quot;.

===&quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot;===
The &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot; are a series of Latin annals of the Carolingian dynasty year-by-year between 741 and 829. Several annals refer to kings of the Danes, as follows:
* Sigfred (&quot;Sigifrid&quot;): In 782, King Sigfred sends a group of &quot;Nordmanni&quot;, Halptani and his companions, to a synod held by Charlemagne. (Sigfred is not explicitly referred to as a king of the Danes in this work, but the others mentioned are.)
* Gudfred (&quot;Godofrid&quot;): Gudfred was mentioned as King of the Danes in the annals of 804, 808, 809, and 810. His reign was characterised by a worsening relationship and finally conflict with Charlemagne&#x27;s Franks. Gudfred was killed by one of his own companions in 810.
* Hemming: Hemming was the son of Gudfred&#x27;s brother, and became king in 810. He made peace with Charlemagne in 811. In 812, he was found dead.
* Sigfred (&quot;Sigifrid&quot;) and Anulo: Two rival claimants to the Danish throne in 812, Sigfred was a nephew of Gudfred and Anulo was a nephew of Harald (&quot;Heriold&quot;). Neither succeeded to the throne as both were killed in combat, but Anulo&#x27;s faction won and the throne passed to his brothers Harald and Reginfrid.
* Reginfrid: Reginfrid was co-king of Denmark with his brother Harald from 812. They petitioned the Emperor (Louis the Pious) to return their brother Hemming, but after he was returned in 813 they were attacked by Danish forces of the sons of Gudfred and forced into exile. In 814 they returned to retake the kingdom, but Reginfrid was killed.
* Harald (&quot;Hariold&quot;): Harald initially ruled with his brother Reginfrid from 812. After being forced out of Denmark, and the death of his brother in 814, Harald sought refuge and support from the Emperor. He continued to harry his rivals, the sons of Gudfred, and in 817 they contacted the Emperor offering peace in exchange for Harald; the Emperor refused. The Emperor helped him retake Denmark in 819 (two sons of Gudfred defected to him). He remained in conflict with them as mentioned in 821, 822 and 823. In 826, he was baptised as a Christian in St. Alban&#x27;s. He was forced out of the country in 827.
* Horik (&quot;Hohric&quot;): One of the sons of Gudfred who took control of Denmark in 813 and battled with Harald for it until 827, Horik is only mentioned in the annal for 827, before the annals conclude in 829.

===&quot;Vita Ansgarii&quot;===
&quot;Vita Ansgarii&quot; is a 9th-century hagiography of saint Ansgar, written by the East Frankish archbishop Rimbert. &quot;Vita Ansgarii&quot; mentions two Danish kings visited by Ansgar:
*Horic the elder (in chapters XXIV, XXVI and XXXI), and
*Horic the younger (in chapters XXXI and XXXII).
Although both kings were pagan, they had good relations with Ansgar and permitted the worship and preaching of Christianity in Denmark (although when the younger Horic first took power, a certain headman had urged him to persecute the Christians).

===&quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;===
Book III of the 12th century &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; by Geoffrey of Monmouth refers to a King of the Dacians named Guichtlac. As mentioned above in the section on &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, the Danes and Dacians had been conflated by European historians since at least the works of Dudo of Saint-Quentin over a century earlier. In Geoffrey&#x27;s tale, Guichtlac had been in love with the daughter of Elsingius the King of Norway, but instead she married Brennius, then King of Northumberland and the brother and rival of Belinus, King of the Britons. After a sea battle, Guichtlac and the lady were washed up in Britain and captured by Belinus. After Brennius defeated Belinus in battle and became King of the Britons, Guichtlac promised to submit Dacia (Denmark) to Brennius and pay yearly tribute if he was given leave to return to Dacia with his mistress, which was granted.

===Others===
* Eric the Child (Horik/Erik Barn): 854- after 864, dead or deposed by 873
* Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye (Sigurd Orm i Øje): mention 873, d. 903, do coin money by East Anglia
** Halfdan (Halvdan): mention 873, d. 876/877

== Multiple sources ==
Many kings are mentioned by multiple sources, but are for various reasons still considered more legendary than historical kings of Denmark

* Harthacnut (&quot;Hardeknud&quot;) (c. 916 – c. 936), the father of Gorm the Old according to multiple sources. The main question is whether he was king of Denmark or only king of some part of Denmark. His parentage is also disputed, as either from an unknown king Sweyn, or from either Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye or king Erik, both said to be children of Ragnar Lodbrok.
* Sigtrygg Gnupasson, either deposed c. 916 by Harthacnut or contemporary, depending on sources. Likely had base in Schleswig, but the extent of his realm is unknown. Son of Gnupa.
* Gnupa (early 900s). Father of Sigtrygg. According to one source he shared power with his brother Gyrd. According to the Saga of Olaf Tryggvason, he was defeated as one of the minor border kings by Gorm when he united Denmark, though that conflicts with Gnupa&#x27;s son being deposed by Gorm&#x27;s father according to other sources.
* Olof the Brash conquered Denmark (or part of Denmark) c. 900.
* Helgi, supposedly deposed by Olaf the Brash.
* Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye (&quot;Sigurd Orm-i-øje&quot; or &quot;Snogeøje&quot;) became king of Zealand and Scania according to the sagas, perhaps correctly named Sigfred and co-ruling as king of Denmark with his brother Halfdan Ragnarsson (d. 877). Mentioned by Chronicon Roskildense and Ragnarssona þáttr. Son of Ragnar Lodbrok.
* Halfdan Ragnarsson (c. 871 – 877), son of Ragnar Lodbrok and older brother of Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye. Leader of the so-called Great Heathen Army of the Anglo-Saxon sources, in 870 and 871. King Bagsecg joined him to become the co-leader of the Great Summer Army of 870 but Bagsecg was killed in battle with the English in January 871. Halfdan succeeded Bagsecg as king of Jutland.
* Bagsecg, Danish king who came to England and was killed in 871.
* Horik II, king from about 854 until about 870.
* Horik I, co-ruler of Denmark from 813, the sole king of Denmark c. 828 to 854. Son of Gudfred.
* Harald Klak, 812 to 813 and 819 to 827, a period of civil war with the sons of Gudfred. Nephew of an earlier Harald.
* Hemming, c. 810 to c. 812. Nephew of Gudfred. Brother of Ragnvald, Håkon and Angantyr.
* Gudfred (&quot;Godfred&quot; or &quot;Gøtrik&quot;), a Danish king c. 804 to 810. Said to be father of Ogier the Dane (&quot;Holger Danske&quot;); possibly the son of Sigfred.
* Ragnar Lodbrok was a legendary king, allegedly flourishing before 865. He is mentioned in multiple sources, but the sources are wildly inconsistent. There is no historical record of anyone named Ragnar ruling Denmark in the 9th century. However his sons Halfdan Ragnarsson and Sigurd Snake-In-the-Eye may have become kings of Denmark, while his son Bjorn Ironside became king of Sweden and Uppsala according to various late sagas.
* Sigfred, Danish king c. 770 to c. 804. Possibly the historical basis for Sigurd Hring. Reported to have assisted the Saxons against Charlemagne.
* Harald Wartooth (&quot;Harald Hildetand&quot;), legendary king of Denmark, Sweden and parts of Norway, sometimes assigned to c. 715 to c. 770. Mentioned in multiple sources. According to one source his conquests reached as far as the Mediterranean. Said to be grandfather of Ragnar Lodbrok.
* Ongendus was a king of the Danes, reigning c. 710, the first Danish king known from contemporary literature.
* Randver, sometimes assigned to the early 700s. Son of Valdar (or Radbard) according to late sagas; fell in England.
* Valdar, sometimes assigned to the early 700s. Son-in-law of Ivar Vidfamne and sub-king in Denmark according to the late sagas.
* Ivar Vidfamne, sometimes assumed to have died in c. 700. The Viking sagas say that Ivar Vidfamne ruled over most of Denmark, Sweden, Saxland and even parts of England.

=== Rig and Scylding line ===
Early kings of the Rig and Scylding lines, mentioned by multiple sources
* Dan mikilláti, son of Danp, brother-in-law of Domar.
* Fróði mikilláti, son of Dan Mikillati

* Hroðgar (Roar), 6th century?, son of Halfdan
* Halga (Helge), 6th century?, son of Halfdan

<text>A Solitary Grief (1991) is a novel by Bernice Rubens about a Harley Street doctor who cannot cope with his own life. Increasingly alienated from his wife and daughter, he also considers himself unable to help his patients any longer and decides to start a new life together with a newly found friend. However, his hopes are again shattered, which eventually leads to catastrophe.

==Plot summary==

The novel opens with psychiatrist Dr Alistair Crown&#x27;s wife Virginia giving birth to the couple&#x27;s first child. Crown, who is not present during birth, is informed immediately afterwards that their daughter Doris has Down&#x27;s syndrome, a fact he is unable to accept. For the next five years, he avoids Doris&#x27;s face: He never looks at her and he refuses to be shown photos of her. His idea of being close to his daughter consists in his nocturnal visits to her bedroom when she is fast asleep: Then he gropes around under the sheets — in a harmless way, imagining what it would be like to have a normal child and envisaging the day when he will actually come face to face with her.

However, he keeps postponing that day, telling himself and his wife that he is not ready for it yet. He leaves for work early in the morning and comes home at night when his daughter is already asleep. He does not tell his parents, who live abroad, that their granddaughter is disabled and, for years, can persuade them not to visit. Although Virginia is a devoted mother and an understanding wife, the ensuing marital crisis is unavoidable. When Doris is of preschool age, Crown actually has to lock himself in his room so as to make sure that he does not accidentally see his daughter&#x27;s face. After a brief fling with a former girlfriend he moves out of the house.

His life takes a decisive turn when he meets a man who calls himself Esau. Esau, who has a very hairy body, is still suffering under his dominant father although the latter has been dead for some time. He has become a compulsive stripper, making appointments with doctors, dentists and masseurs only to perform his stripping routine in front of them and wait for their reaction. The two men strike up an asexual friendship, and Crown moves into Esau&#x27;s large house. Although he realizes that Esau is in urgent need of psychiatric treatment, Crown just sees a friend in him and refuses to have any therapeutic influence on Esau. He is devastated when Esau commits suicide by hanging himself in the attic.

Now Crown&#x27;s life totally gets out of control. Early one morning a few days before Doris&#x27;s fifth birthday he kidnaps her from the playground of her nursery school — still without looking at her —, drives with her to Hyde Park, strangles her from behind and buries her face down under a tree in a shallow grave dug out with his bare hands. Back at his office, he is informed by his wife that Doris has gone missing. For a couple of days, the police search for the girl but then give up all hope of ever finding her alive and well. When soon afterwards her body is found, Crown has to accompany the police to the morgue to identify his daughter. This is when he comes face to face with her for the first — and last — time.

The police never solve the crime. Some time later Crown hangs himself in the garage.

<text>Karl Felix Halm (also &quot;Carl&quot;; &quot;Karl Felix Ritter von Halm&quot; after 1872; 5 April 1809 – 5 October 1882), was a German classical scholar and critic.

==Life==
He was born at Munich. In 1849, having held appointments at Speyer and Hadamar, he became rector of the newly founded &quot;Maximiliansgymnasium&quot; at Munich, and in 1856 director of the royal library and professor in the University of Munich. These posts he held until his death.

==Works==
Halm is known chiefly as the editor of Cicero and other Latin prose authors, although during his early career he also devoted considerable attention to Greek and also authored an edition of Aesop&#x27;s fables in the Greek. After the death of J.C. Orelli, he joined J.G. Baiter in the preparation of a revised critical edition of the rhetorical and philosophical writings of Cicero (1854–1862). His school editions of some of the speeches of Cicero in the Haupt and Sauppe series, with notes and introductions, were very successful. He also edited a number of classical texts for the Teubner series, the most important of which are Tacitus (4th edition, 1883); &quot;Rhetores Latini minores&quot; (1863); Quintilian (1868); Sulpicius Severus (1866); &quot;Minucius Felix&quot; together with &quot;Firmicus Maternus De errore&quot; (1867); &quot;Salvianus&quot; (1877) and Victor Vitensis&#x27;s &quot;Historia persecutionis Africanae provinciae&quot; (1878). He was also an enthusiastic collector of autographs.

==Scholarly shorthand==
Scholars of the period will sometimes talk of the &quot;Halmian&quot; edition, or even of the &quot;Halmianam&quot; edition if they are writing in Latin. By this they mean an edition authored or edited by Halm.

<text>Gary Warren Hart (&quot;né&quot; Hartpence; born November 28, 1936) is an American politician, diplomat, and lawyer. He was the front-runner for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination until he dropped out amid revelations of extramarital affairs. He represented Colorado in the United States Senate from 1975 to 1987.

Born in Ottawa, Kansas, Hart pursued a legal career in Denver, Colorado after graduating from Yale Law School. He managed Senator George McGovern&#x27;s successful campaign for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination and McGovern&#x27;s unsuccessful general election campaign against President Richard Nixon. Hart defeated incumbent Republican Senator Peter Dominick in Colorado&#x27;s 1974 Senate election. In the Senate, he served on the Church Committee and led the Senate investigation regarding the Three Mile Island accident. After narrowly winning re-election in 1980, he sponsored the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, becoming known as an &quot;Atari Democrat&quot;.

Hart sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984, narrowly losing the race to former Vice President Walter Mondale. Hart declined to seek re-election to the Senate in 1986 and sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988. He was widely viewed as the front-runner until reports surfaced of an extramarital affair, and Hart withdrew from the race in May 1987. He re-entered the race in December 1987 but withdrew from the race again after faring poorly in the early primaries. The nomination ultimately went to Michael Dukakis.

Hart returned to private practice after the 1988 election and served in a variety of public roles. He co-chaired the Hart-Rudman Task Force on Homeland Security, served on the Homeland Security Advisory Council, and was the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. He earned a doctorate in politics from the University of Oxford and has written for outlets such as &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. He has also written several books, including a biography of President James Monroe. Hart married Lee Ludwig in 1958, who died at age 85 on April 9, 2021. They had two children, John and Andrea Hart.

==Early life and education==
Hart was born in Ottawa, Kansas, the son of Nina (née Pritchard) and Carl Riley Hartpence, a farm equipment salesman. As a young man, he worked as a laborer on the railroad. He and his father changed their last name to &quot;Hart&quot; in 1961 because &quot;Hart is a lot easier to remember than Hartpence.&quot; Raised in the Church of the Nazarene (which he ultimately left in 1968), he won a scholarship to the Church-affiliated Bethany Nazarene College (now Southern Nazarene University) in Bethany, Oklahoma, in 1954 and graduated with a B.A. in philosophy in 1958. He met his wife, Oletha &quot;Lee&quot; Ludwig, there, and they married in 1958. Initially intending to enter the Nazarene ministry, he received a B.D. from Yale Divinity School in 1961 before receiving an LL.B. from Yale Law School in 1964.

== Career ==

=== Early legal work ===
Hart became an attorney for the United States Department of Justice from 1964 to 1965 and was admitted to the Colorado and District of Columbia bars in 1965. He was special assistant to the solicitor of the United States Department of the Interior from 1965 to 1967. He then entered private law practice in Denver, Colorado, at the firm of Davis Graham &amp; Stubbs.

===George McGovern&#x27;s 1972 presidential campaign===

Following the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, U.S. Senator George McGovern of South Dakota co-chaired a commission that revised the Democratic presidential nomination structure. The new structure weakened the influence of such old-style party bosses as Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, who were once able to hand-pick national convention delegates and dictate the way they voted. The new rules made caucuses a process in which relative newcomers could participate without paying dues to established party organizations.

In the 1972 primary elections, McGovern named Hart his national campaign director. Along with Rick Stearns, an expert on the new system, they decided on a strategy to focus on the 28 states holding caucuses instead of primary elections. They felt the nature of the caucuses made them easier and less costly to win if they targeted their efforts. While their primary election strategy proved successful in winning the nomination, McGovern went on to lose the 1972 presidential election in one of the most lopsided elections in U.S. history.

===United States Senator===
In 1974, Hart ran for the United States Senate, challenging two-term incumbent Republican Peter Dominick. Hart was aided by Colorado&#x27;s trend toward Democrats during the early 1970s, as well as Dominick&#x27;s continued support for the unpopular President Richard Nixon and concerns about the senator&#x27;s health. In the general election, Hart won by a wide margin (57.2% to Dominick&#x27;s 39.5%) and was immediately labeled a rising star. He got a seat on the Armed Services Committee, and was an early supporter of reforming the bidding for military contracts, as well as an advocate for the military using smaller, more mobile weapons and equipment, as opposed to the traditional large-scale items. He also served on the Environment and Public Work Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee. From 1975 to 1976, Hart was a member of the post-Watergate Church Committee that investigated abuses by the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service. Hart served as the chairman of Senate Subcommittee on Nuclear Regulation. He flew over the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in an Army helicopter several times with fellow Senator Alan Simpson during the nuclear accident and led the subsequent Senate investigation into the incident.

In 1980, he sought a second term. In something of a surprise, his Republican opponent was Colorado Secretary of State Mary Estill Buchanan, a moderate candidate who narrowly defeated the more conservative choice, Howard &quot;Bo&quot; Callaway, in the party primary, by fewer than 2,000 primary votes. Fourteen years earlier, Callaway was the Republican gubernatorial nominee in his native Georgia. Callaway in the early 1970s had bought and run an elegant resort in Crested Butte. Buchanan hit Hart hard for supporting the Panama Canal Treaties and for backing then-President Jimmy Carter in 80% of his Senate votes. Buchanan charged in a campaign ad about Hart: &quot;He votes one way and talks another when he is back here. He is a liberal, McGovernite carpetbagger.&quot; Hart responded that Buchanan&#x27;s charges reflected her narrow viewpoint and insisted that his campaign would rise above partisanship. Said Hart in a campaign ad: &quot;I will not ignore her. We will interact and debate, but I am going to run a campaign for the 1980s. What is her plan for the environment? For national defense? For the economy? It took me a year or so to formulate my ideas.&quot; In the end, Hart won narrowly, with 50.2% of the vote to his opponent&#x27;s 48.7%.

On December 2, 1981, Hart was one of only four senators to vote against an amendment to President Reagan&#x27;s MX missiles proposal that would divert the silo system by $334 million as well as earmark further research for other methods that would allow giant missiles to be based. The vote was seen as a rebuff of the Reagan administration. Hart cosponsored the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984 with Senator Charles Mathias, which was signed into law. The act created a new category of intellectual property rights that makes the layouts of integrated circuits legally protected upon registration, and hence illegal to copy without permission. This protected Silicon Valley chips from cheap foreign imitations. Similar legislation had been proposed in every Congress since 1979. It led to Hart being called the leader of the &quot;Atari Democrats&quot;. Conservative Republican Senator Barry Goldwater remarked of Hart, &quot;You can disagree with him politically, but I have never met a man who is more honest and more moral.&quot; Like most of the Democratic party, Hart supported abortion rights.

===United States Naval Reserve service===
Citing the increasing likelihood of an armed conflict in the Persian Gulf and his reluctance to &quot;stay in the Senate and authorize and appropriate funds to send young men like my son off to fight that war,&quot; Hart applied for a commission in the United States Naval Reserve&#x27;s Standby Reserve Active Status List program in the late 1970s. He was over the statutory age limit of 38 and had not amassed any prior military experience; moreover, in contrast to his stated rationale, this category &quot;would not be called up immediately in the event of a mobilization.&quot; By mutual agreement, Hart and United States Secretary of the Navy Edward Hidalgo deferred the consideration of the request until the aftermath of the 1980 election. His application contained an incorrect birth date (November 28, 1937) that he had used inconsistently on official documents for 15 years.

Following his reelection, Hart received an age waiver from Hidalgo and was commissioned as a lieutenant (junior grade) in the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps on December 4, 1980. The commission carried &quot;no pay or allowances.&quot; Although Hart sought to be commissioned in the grades of lieutenant commander or commander (in keeping with contemporaries in Congress who had served in World War II and the Korean War), Navy Judge Advocate General John S. Jenkins advised Hidalgo to commission Hart at the lower rank because he &quot;didn&#x27;t bring to the program anything that was so unusual that we could recommend appointment at a higher grade.&quot; However, then-U.S. Navy Senate liaison officer John McCain (who cultivated a close friendship with Hart in that capacity, presaging his own political career) maintained in a 1984 interview that a field officer appointment would have been &quot;appropriate.&quot; Following ten days of active duty with the United States Sixth Fleet in August 1981, Hart was promoted to lieutenant on January 1, 1982. Pundits such as Rowland Evans and Robert Novak suggested that Hart&#x27;s appointment was a cynical political maneuver designed to &quot;clear the biographical decks&quot; for the 1984 presidential election in an era when military service was perceived as a tacit prerequisite for the presidency.

In a 2007 commentary for &quot;HuffPost&quot;, Hart asserted that his desire to &quot;understand and communicate better with our troops&quot; was the primary motivation for his appointment. Although he &quot;did not routinely fulfill [his] reserve duties&quot; and &quot;chose not to feature this experience in subsequent campaigns&quot;, he maintained that his service &quot;helped [him] enormously in appreciating what our military does to make us more secure.&quot;

===1984 presidential campaign===


In February 1983, during his second term, Hart announced his candidacy for president in the 1984 presidential election. Although he had cultivated longstanding friendships with prominent actors and journalists (including Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Penny Marshall and Hunter S. Thompson) as a byproduct of his work on the McGovern campaign, Hart was little known to the general electorate and barely received above 1 percent in the polls in a competitive field that encompassed such recognizable candidates as former Vice President Walter Mondale, Project Mercury astronaut John Glenn, civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, and even his old boss, former Senator George McGovern. To counter this situation, Hart started campaigning early in New Hampshire, making a then-unprecedented canvassing tour in late September, months before the primary. This strategy attracted national media attention to his campaign, and by late 1983, he had risen moderately in the polls to the middle of the field, mostly at the expense of the sinking candidacies of Glenn and Alan Cranston. Mondale won the Iowa caucus in late January, but Hart polled a respectable 16 percent. Two weeks later, in the New Hampshire primary, he shocked much of the party establishment and the media by defeating Mondale by 10 percentage points. Hart instantly became the main challenger to Mondale for the nomination and appeared to have the momentum on his side.

Hart&#x27;s media campaign was produced by Raymond Strother, a native Texan who had begun his career in Louisiana. Hart could not overcome Mondale&#x27;s financial and organizational advantages, especially among labor union leaders in the Midwest and industrial Northeast. Hart&#x27;s campaign was chronically in debt, to a final count of $4.75 million. In states like Illinois, where delegates were elected directly by primary voters, Hart often had incomplete delegate slates. Hart&#x27;s ideas were criticized as too vague and centrist by many Democrats. Shortly after he became the new frontrunner, it was revealed that Hart had changed his last name, had often listed 1937 instead of 1936 as his birth date and had changed his signature several times. This, along with two separations from his wife (1979 and 1981), Lee, caused some to question Hart&#x27;s &quot;flake factor.&quot; Hart himself admitted in an interview that he was going through a midlife crisis and focused too much on his career, neglecting his family. Reporters observed that the Harts appeared distant and distracted in public. Hart was also not close to his children, often leaving his wife to raise them completely alone. He and his wife briefly dated each other casually during their second separation, which occurred for a few months in 1981. Additionally, the Harts had begun divorce proceedings but had stopped them after reconciling. Hart and his wife later stated that the separations, caused by too much time spent apart due to politics, only strengthened their marriage. The Harts would remain married until Lee&#x27;s death on April 10, 2021.

The two men swapped victories in the primaries, with Hart getting exposure as a candidate with &quot;new ideas&quot; and Mondale rallying the party establishment to his side. The two men fought to a draw in the Super Tuesday, with Hart winning states in the West, Florida and New England. Mondale fought back and began ridiculing Hart&#x27;s campaign platform. The most famous television moment of the campaign was during a debate when he mocked Hart&#x27;s &quot;new ideas&quot; by quoting a line from a popular Wendy&#x27;s television commercial at the time: &quot;Where&#x27;s the beef?&quot; Hart&#x27;s campaign could not effectively counter this remark, and when he ran negative TV commercials against Mondale in the Illinois primary, his appeal as a new kind of Democrat never entirely recovered. Hart lost the New York and Pennsylvania primaries, but won those of Ohio and Indiana.

Mondale gradually pulled away from Hart in the delegate count, but the race was not decided until June, on &quot;Super Tuesday III&quot;. Decided that day were delegates from five states: South Dakota, New Mexico, West Virginia, California and New Jersey. The proportional nature of delegate selection meant that Mondale was likely to obtain enough delegates on that day to secure the stated support of an overall majority of delegates, and hence the nomination, no matter who actually &quot;won&quot; the states contested. However, Hart maintained that unpledged superdelegates that had previously claimed support for Mondale would shift to his side if he swept the Super Tuesday III primary. Once again, Hart committed a &quot;faux pas,&quot; insulting New Jersey shortly before the primary day. Campaigning in California, he remarked that while the &quot;bad news&quot; was that he and his wife had to campaign separately, &quot;[T]he good news for her is that she campaigns in California while I campaign in New Jersey.&quot; Compounding the problem, when his wife interjected that she &quot;got to hold a koala bear&quot;, Hart replied that &quot;I won&#x27;t tell you what I got to hold: samples from a toxic waste dump.&quot; While Hart won California, he lost New Jersey after leading in polls by as much as 15 points.

By the time the final primaries concluded, Mondale had a considerable lead in total delegates, though he was 40 delegates short of clinching victory. Superdelegates voted overwhelmingly for Mondale at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco on July 16, making him the presidential nominee. Hart, already aware that the nomination was all but Mondale&#x27;s after the final primaries, lobbied for the vice presidential slot on the ticket, claiming that he would do better than Mondale against President Ronald Reagan (an argument undercut by a June 1984 Gallup poll that showed both men nine points behind the president). While Hart was given serious consideration, Mondale chose Geraldine Ferraro instead. In his address to the convention, after his name was placed in nomination for president by Nebraska governor Bob Kerrey and he received a 15-minute standing ovation, Hart concluded, &quot;Our party and our country will continue to hear from us. This is one Hart you will not leave in San Francisco.&quot;

This race for the nomination was the most recent occasion that a major party presidential nomination has gone all the way to the convention. Mondale was later defeated in a landslide by the incumbent Reagan, winning only his home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia. Many felt that Hart and other similar candidates, younger and more independent-minded, represented the future of the party. Hart had refused to take money from Political Action Committees (PACs), and as a result he mortgaged his house to self-finance his campaign, and was more than $1 million in debt at the end of the campaign.

===1988 presidential campaign===

Hart declined to run for re-election to the Senate, leaving office when his second term expired with the intent of running for president again. On December 20, 1986, Hart was allegedly followed by an anonymous private investigator from a radio station where he had given the Democratic Party&#x27;s response to President Reagan&#x27;s weekly radio address. That alleged investigator report claimed that Hart had been followed to a woman&#x27;s house, photographed there, and left sometime the following morning. This allegation would ultimately cause him to suspend his planned presidential campaign. After Mario Cuomo announced in February 1987 that he would not enter the race, Hart was the clear frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in the 1988 election.

Hart officially declared his candidacy on April 13, 1987. When Lois Romano, a reporter for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, asked Hart to respond to rumors spread by other campaigns that he was a &quot;womanizer&quot;, Hart said such candidates were &quot;not going to win that way, because you don&#x27;t get to the top by tearing someone else down.&quot; The &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that comment on its front page with the headline lead in &quot;Straight from the Hart&quot;, followed below with big, black block letters: &quot;., and then a summary of the story: &quot;Dem blasts rivals over sex life rumors&quot;.

In late April 1987, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; claimed that an anonymous informant contacted the paper to relate that Hart was having an affair with a friend, claimed it was the equivalent of the Iran-Contra scandal, provided details about the affair, and told the &quot;Herald&quot; that Hart was going to meet this person at his Washington, D.C., townhouse on May 1, a Friday. As a result, a team of &quot;Herald&quot; reporters followed Donna Rice on a flight from Miami to Washington, D.C., then staked out Hart&#x27;s townhouse that evening and the following day, and observed a young woman and Hart together. The &quot;Herald&quot; reporters confronted Hart on Saturday evening in an alley about his relationship with Rice. Hart replied, &quot;I&#x27;m not involved in any relationship,&quot; and alleged that he had been set up.

The &quot;Herald&quot; published a story on May 3 that Hart had spent Friday night and most of Saturday with a young woman in his Washington, D.C. townhouse. On that same day, in an interview with E. J. Dionne that appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Hart, responding to the rumors of his womanizing, said: &quot;Follow me around. I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m serious. If anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They&#x27;ll be very bored.&quot; At some point, the reporters for the &quot;Herald&quot; learned that &quot;The New York Times&quot; was planning to feature the quote in their article on Sunday. When the two articles appeared on the same day, a political firestorm was ignited. On Sunday, Hart&#x27;s campaign denied any scandal and condemned the &quot;Herald&quot;″s reporters for intrusive reporting. Hart later noted that his &quot;follow me around&quot; comment was not &quot;challenging the press with a taunt&quot;, but, made in frustration, was only intended to invite the media to observe his public behavior, and never intended to invite reporters to be &quot;skulking around in the shadows&quot; of his home. He did not think of it as a challenge,&#x27; Dionne would recall many years later. &#x27;And at the time, I did not think of it as a challenge. Nor did Hart&#x27;s comment influence the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; to pursue the story.

The next day, Monday, the young woman was identified as Donna Rice, and she gave a press conference also denying any sexual relationship with Hart. Hart insisted that his interest in Rice was limited to her working as a campaign aide. However, as a &quot;New York Times&quot; article put it, &quot;the facts floated on a sea of innuendo.&quot; The scandal spread rapidly through the national media, as did another damaging story about angry creditors of the $1.3 million debt Hart had incurred in his 1984 campaign. Media questions about the affair came to dominate coverage of Hart&#x27;s campaign, but his staff believed that voters were not as interested in the topic as the media was. Hart&#x27;s staff believed that the media was filtering his message. A Gallup Poll conducted that week for &quot;Newsweek&quot; (but published the following week) found that 55% of Democrats believed that Hart had been truthful, and 44% of them were unconcerned about the issue. The polling of all voters was even more favorable to Hart. Nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of the respondents it surveyed thought the media treatment of Hart was &quot;unfair&quot;, and 70% disapproved of covert surveillance by the media. A little over half (53%) responded that marital infidelity had little to do with a president&#x27;s ability to govern. &quot;Time&quot; magazine had similar results: of those polled, 67% disapproved of the media writing about a candidate&#x27;s sex life, and 60% stated that Hart&#x27;s relationship with Rice was irrelevant to the presidency. When queried about the matter, Mario Cuomo remarked that there were &quot;skeletons in everybody&#x27;s closet.&quot;

On May 8, 1987, a week after the story broke, Hart suspended his campaign after &quot;The Washington Post&quot; threatened to run a story about a woman Hart had dated while separated from his wife, and his wife and daughter became similar subjects of interest for tabloid journalists. At a press conference, Hart defiantly stated, &quot;I said that I bend, but I don&#x27;t break, and believe me, I&#x27;m not broken.&quot; Hart identified the invasive media coverage, and its need to &quot;dissect&quot; him, as his reason for suspending his campaign, &quot;If someone&#x27;s able to throw up a smokescreen and keep it up there long enough, you can&#x27;t get your message across. You can&#x27;t raise the money to finance a campaign; there&#x27;s too much static, and you can&#x27;t communicate. Clearly, under the present circumstances, this campaign cannot go on. I refuse to submit my family and my friends and innocent people and myself to further rumors and gossip. It&#x27;s simply an intolerable situation.&quot; Hart paraphrased Thomas Jefferson and warned, &quot;I tremble for my country when I think we may, in fact, get the kind of leaders we deserve.&quot; Hart later recalled, &quot;I watched journalists become animals, literally.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; opined that some compared Hart&#x27;s press conference to Richard Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Last Press Conference&quot; of November 7, 1962, in which Nixon blamed the media for his loss in the 1962 California gubernatorial election and did not take responsibility for his own actions. Hart, in fact, received a letter from Nixon himself commending him for &quot;handling a very difficult situation uncommonly well&quot;. The unprecedented nature of the investigation and reporting on Hart&#x27;s personal life was widely noted and reported at the time; &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the situation &quot;will certainly provoke a needed debate on his contention that the system has gone out of control.&quot; Having withdrawn from the presidential race, Hart left for Ireland to spend time away from the media with his son. He rented a cottage in Oughterard, though he remained in contact with key members of his team. What news did filter out was that he was not excluding a return to the race. &quot;The New York Times&quot; also pointed to his odd ambivalence toward the presidency even before being caught by &quot;the system&quot;: &quot;Only half of me wants to be President. ... The other half wants to go write novels in Ireland. But the 50 percent that wants to be President is better than 100 percent of the others.&quot;

His campaign chairwoman, Colorado congresswoman Patricia Schroeder, jumped into the race following Hart&#x27;s withdrawal, but soon after withdrew herself at an emotional press conference on September 28, 1987. In December 1987, Hart returned to the race, declaring on the steps of the New Hampshire Statehouse, &quot;Let&#x27;s let the people decide!&quot; Hart said that the other candidates did not represent his new ideas of strategic investment economics, military reform and &quot;enlightened engagement in foreign policy.&quot; Hart warned, &quot;We could lose more young Americans unnecessarily in the Persian Gulf.&quot; He initially rose to the top of the polls nationally, and second behind Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in New Hampshire, but was soon confronted with more negative stories about prior debts from his 1984 campaign. He competed in the New Hampshire primary and received 4,888 votes, about four percent. After the Super Tuesday contests on March 8, in which he won no more than five percent of the vote, Hart withdrew from the campaign a second time. Eventual Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis lost the 1988 United States presidential election by a substantial margin in both the popular and electoral vote, by margins unequaled since, winning in only 10 of 50 states.

A &quot;Miami Herald&quot; editor who participated in the paper&#x27;s initial Hart scandal stories disputed the possibility of a conspiracy theory involving Lee Atwater as published in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, which described a reputed deathbed admission by Atwater that he had staged the incident with Donna Rice aboard the yacht &quot;Monkey Business.&quot;

===Later career===

After his Senate service and presidential races, Hart resumed his law practice. He remained moderately active in public policy matters, serving on the bipartisan US Commission on National Security/21st Century, also known as the Hart–Rudman Commission, commissioned on behalf of Bill Clinton in 1998 to study U.S. homeland security. The commission issued several findings calling for broad changes to security policy, but none were implemented until after the September 11 attacks. He earned a D.Phil. in politics from the University of Oxford in 2001 with a dissertation entitled &quot;The Restoration of the Republic&quot;; while at Oxford, he was a member of St Antony&#x27;s College.

Hart gave a speech before the American international law firm Coudert Brothers on September 4, 2001, exactly one week before the September 11 attacks, warning that within the next 25 years a terrorist attack would lead to mass deaths in the United States. Hart met with aviation executives in Montreal, Canada, on September 5, 2001, to warn of terrorist attacks. The &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; reported the story the following day with a headline, &quot;Thousands Will Die, Ex-Presidential Hopeful Says.&quot; On September 6, 2001, Hart met with National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice to urge, &quot;You must move more quickly on homeland security. An attack is going to happen.&quot; In a subsequent interview with Salon.com, Hart accused President George W. Bush and other administration officials of ignoring his warnings.

In late 2002, urged by former Oxford classmates, Hart began testing the waters for another run for the presidency, launching a website at GaryHartNews.com and a related speaking tour to gauge reactions from the public. He started his own blog in the spring of 2003, the first prospective presidential candidate to do so. After a few months of speaking, Hart decided not to run for president and instead endorsed Democrat John Kerry. According to an October 23, 2004 &quot;National Journal&quot; article and later reports in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Hart was mentioned as a probable Cabinet appointment if Kerry won the presidency. He was considered a top candidate for either Director of National Intelligence, Secretary of Homeland Security or Secretary of Defense.

Since May 2005, he has been a contributing blogger at &quot;HuffPost&quot;. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Hart also sits on the advisory board of Operation USA, a Los Angeles-based international relief and development agency. It was announced in January 2006 that Hart will hold an endowed professorship at the University of Colorado. He is the author of &quot;James Monroe&quot;, part of the Times Books series on American presidents published in October 2005. Hart is an Honorary Fellow of the Literary &amp; Historical Society of University College Dublin. He is an advisory board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. He is also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

In September 2007, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; published Hart&#x27;s letter, &quot;Unsolicited Advice to the Government of Iran&quot;, in which he stated that &quot;Provocation is no longer required to take America to war&quot; and warns Iran that &quot;for the next sixteen months or so, you should not only not take provocative actions, you should not seem to be doing so.&quot; He went on to suggest that the Bush-Cheney administration was waiting for an opportunity to attack Iran, writing: &quot;Don&#x27;t give a certain vice president we know the justification he is seeking to attack your country.&quot; In an essay published in November 2007, Hart linked American energy policy with national security. Hart wrote, &quot;In fact, we do have an energy policy: It&#x27;s to continue to import more than half our oil and sacrifice American lives so we can drive our Humvees. This is our current policy, and it is massively immoral.&quot; Hart currently sits on the board of directors for the Energy Literacy Advocates. He founded the American Security Project in 2007 and he started a new blog in 2009.

Since retiring from the Senate, he has emerged as a consultant on national security, and continues to speak on a wide range of issues, including the environment and homeland security. In 2006, Hart accepted an endowed professorship at the University of Colorado at Denver. He has been a visiting lecturer at Oxford University, Yale University, and the University of California. He is Chair of the U.S. State Department&#x27;s International Security Advisory Council, Chair of the U.S. Defense Department&#x27;s Threat Advisory Council, and Chair of the American Security Project. He was vice-chair of the Advisory Council for the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, Co-chair of the U.S.-Russia Commission, Chairman of the Council for a Livable World, and President of Global Green, the U.S. affiliate of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s environmental foundation. Most notably, he was co-chair of the U.S. Commission on National Security for the 21st Century, known as the Hart-Rudman Commission, which predicted terrorist attacks on America before 9/11.

Hart has written or co-authored numerous books and articles, including five novels.

===U.S. Special Envoy for Northern Ireland===
In October 2014, President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry named Hart as the new United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. Hart is the second former U.S. Senator to hold the post. The first was George Mitchell, former seat-mate and former Majority Leader of the United States Senate, who served from 1995 to 2001. In a statement, Kerry called Hart &quot;a longtime friend&quot; and said he was &quot;a problem-solver, a brilliant analyst, and someone capable of thinking at once tactically, strategically, and practically.&quot;

<doc id="200497" wikidata="Q5456252" url="?curid=200497" title="Five pounds (British coin)">
<text>The British five pound (£5) coin is a commemorative denomination of sterling coinage. As of October 2022, the obverse of new coins feature the profile of King Charles III. The obverse previously depicted Queen Elizabeth II between the coin&#x27;s introduction in 1990 and the Queen&#x27;s death in 2022. Two different portraits of the Queen graced the coin, with the last design by Ian Rank-Broadley being introduced in 1998. The coin has no standard reverse; instead it is altered each year to commemorate important events. Variant obverses have also been used on occasion.

The coin is a continuation of the crown, which after decimalisation became the commemorative twenty-five pence coin. The twenty-five pence was discontinued in 1981 after creating a large coin with such small value became prohibitively expensive. The five pound coin shares the same dimensions as the twenty-five pence coin, and the five shilling coin before it, but has a nominal value twenty times greater.

Five pound coins are legal tender but are intended as souvenirs and are rarely seen in circulation. The coins are sold by the Royal Mint at face value and also, with presentation folders, at a premium to that face value. The vast majority of souvenir crowns were issued as &quot;Brilliant Uncirculated&quot; and were affordable by most collectors. The 2010 coins, with such folders, were sold for £9.95 each. As of 2020 the coin and folder cost £13. Occasionally, to mark special occasions, the Royal Mint issued some crowns only struck in .925 sterling silver to a higher standard, known as &quot;silver proof&quot; and priced at £100 and upwards aimed at serious collectors with deeper pockets.

A £5 memorial crown featuring the image of Charles III was released on 3 October 2022 honouring the life and legacy of his mother Queen Elizabeth II - the UK&#x27;s longest reigning monarch.

Separate five pound coin designs have also been released in various British crown dependencies and British Overseas Territories. These are outside of the scope of this article and are not listed below.

<doc id="200499" wikidata="Q119310" url="?curid=200499" title="Johann Caspar von Orelli">
<text>Johann Caspar von Orelli (Latin &quot;Iohannes Caspar Orellius&quot;; 13 February 1787 – 6 January 1849), was a Swiss classical scholar.

==Life==
He was born at Zürich of a distinguished Italian-speaking family from Locarno which had taken refuge in German-speaking Switzerland at the time of the Protestant Reformation. His cousin, Johann Conrad Orelli (1770–1826), was the author of several works in the department of later Greek literature.

From 1807 to 1814 Orelli worked as preacher in the reformed community of Bergamo, where he acquired the taste for Italian literature which led to the publication of &quot;Contributions to the History of Italian Poetry&quot; (1810) and a biography (1812) of Vittorino da Feltre, his ideal of a teacher.

In 1814 he became teacher of modern languages and history at the cantonal school at Chur; in 1819, professor of eloquence and hermeneutics at the Carolinum, Zürich, and in 1833 professor at the new University of Zürich, the foundation of which was largely due to his efforts. His attention during this period was mainly devoted to classical literature and antiquities. He had already published (1814) an edition, with critical notes and commentary, of the &quot;Antidosis&quot; of Isocrates, the complete text of which, based upon the manuscripts in the Ambrosian and Laurentian libraries, had been made known by Andreas Mustoxydis of Corfu.

He was a most liberal-minded man, both in politics and religion, an enthusiastic supporter of popular education and a most inspiring teacher. He took great interest in the struggle of the Greeks for independence, and strongly favoured the appointment of the notorious David Strauss to the chair of dogmatic theology at Zürich, which led to the disturbance of September 6, 1839 and the fall of the liberal government.

==Work==
The three scholarly works upon which his reputation rests are the following:
#A complete edition of Cicero in eight volumes (1826–1838). The first four volumes contained the text (new ed., 1845–1863), the fifth the old Scholiasts, the remaining three (called &quot;Onomasticon Tullianum&quot;) a life of Cicero, a bibliography of previous editions, indexes of geographical and historical names, of laws and legal formulae, of Greek words, and the consular annals. After his death, the revised edition of the text was completed by J.G. Baiter and K. Halm, and contained numerous emendations by Theodor Mommsen and J.N. Madvig.
#&quot;The works of Horace&quot; (1837–1838). The exegetical commentary, although confessedly only a compilation from the works of earlier commentators, shows great taste and extensive learning, although hardly up to the exacting standard of modern criticism.
#A collection of Latin inscriptions (&quot;Inscriptionum Latinarum Selectarum Collectio&quot;; 1828; revised edition by Wilhelm Henzen, 1856), extremely helpful for the study of Roman public and private life and religion.

His editions of Plato (1839–1841, including the old &quot;scholia&quot;, in collaboration with A. W. Winckelmann) and Tacitus (1846–1848) also deserve mention.

In 1832 he became a third-class corresponding member, living abroad, of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.

<text>The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., often referred to as just Brisco or Brisco County, is an American weird western television series created by Jeffrey Boam and Carlton Cuse. It ran for 27 episodes on the Fox network starting in the 1993–94 season. Set in the American West of 1893, the series follows its title character, a Harvard-educated lawyer-turned-bounty hunter hired by a group of wealthy industrialists to track and capture outlaw John Bly and his gang. Bruce Campbell plays Brisco, who is joined by a colorful group of supporting characters, including Julius Carry as fellow bounty hunter Lord Bowler and Christian Clemenson as stick-in-the-mud lawyer Socrates Poole.

While ostensibly a Western, the series routinely includes elements of the science fiction and steampunk genres. Humor is a large part of the show; the writers attempted to keep the jokes and situations &quot;just under over-the-top&quot;. A large number of episodes involve the Orb, a powerful device from the future. John Astin plays Professor Wickwire, an inventor who assists Brisco with anachronistic technology including diving suits, motorcycles, rockets, and airships. The search for new technology and progressive ideas, what the writers of the show called &quot;The Coming Thing&quot;, is a central theme throughout the series.

&quot;Brisco&quot; was developed by Boam and Cuse at the request of Fox executive Bob Greenblatt. Impressed by the duo&#x27;s work on the script for the 1989 film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, Greenblatt suggested they develop a series that bore the tone and style of vintage movie serials. The initial ideas and proposals from the show&#x27;s writers were more often suited for film than television and had to be scaled down. &quot;Brisco&quot; was one of the last television shows to be filmed on the Warner Bros. Western backlot. Randy Edelman composed the distinctive theme music, which has been reused by NBC during its coverage of the 1997 World Series and the Olympic Games.

During its broadcast run, &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot; garnered a small but dedicated following and was well received by critics. The series earned high ratings at the beginning of its season, but later episodes failed to attract a substantial number of viewers. Fox canceled the show at the end of its first and only season. In 2006, Warner Home Video released a DVD set containing all 27 episodes. The series has been remembered fondly by critics, who praise its humor and unique blend of genres.

==Plot==

===Background===
&quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot;, is set in a fictional American Old West of 1893. Robber barons control the financial and industrial interests of the West from the boardrooms of San Francisco&#x27;s Westerfield Club. The famous U.S. Marshal Brisco County, Sr. (R. Lee Ermey) has apprehended a gang of outlaws and its leader, the notorious John Bly (Billy Drago). While transporting them to stand trial, County is murdered and the gang escapes. Meanwhile, in a nearby mine, a group of shackled Chinese workers unearths &quot;The Orb&quot;, a large golden globe studded with rods. A worker draws one of the rods from out of the Orb, then touches several of his co-workers with it. As each worker is touched with the rod he is imbued with superhuman strength which they use to break the iron chains binding them, thus freeing themselves. The murder of Brisco County, Sr., and the discovery of the Orb set into motion the major plots of the series.

===Synopsis===
Members of the Westerfield Club hire Brisco County, Jr. (Bruce Campbell), the son of the slain U.S. Marshal, to track and re-capture Bly and his gang. The Westerfield Club&#x27;s timid lawyer, Socrates Poole (Christian Clemenson) relays instructions and financial support to Brisco. Another bounty hunter, Lord Bowler (Julius Carry), who is known for his expert tracking skills, also hopes to capture Bly. Bitter over the elder County&#x27;s fame, Bowler treats Brisco as a rival. The two men often find themselves reluctantly joining forces to achieve a common goal. Later in the series, Brisco and Bowler work together as partners and friends.

In the pilot episode, Brisco tracks John Bly&#x27;s second-in-command, Big Smith (M. C. Gainey). In a battle on a train car, Brisco knocks Smith off the train and into a river; he is assumed dead until he reappears later in the series. Brisco, Bowler and Socrates hunt the rest of Bly&#x27;s gang in subsequent episodes. All ten of the gang members are captured or killed, and Brisco&#x27;s pursuit of Bly, who is seeking the Orb for its supernatural power, frequently puts him into contact with the object. Each encounter with the Orb reveals a fantastic effect on people who use it. In the episode &quot;The Orb Scholar&quot;, Bly shoots Brisco and leaves him to die. Professor Ogden Coles (Brandon Maggart), a scientist who studies the Orb, heals Brisco with the device. In the episode &quot;Bye Bly&quot;, it is revealed that Bly is a fugitive from the distant future who has traveled to 1893 to steal the Orb. Bly plans to use the Orb to travel back to his time and rule the world. Instead, Brisco uses the Orb to travel through time to save Bowler&#x27;s life. Brisco eventually kills Bly by stabbing him with a rod from the Orb, causing Bly to disintegrate into a pile of ashes. Series creator and executive producer Carlton Cuse said that the Orb represents faith and that depending on the intentions of those who use it, the object rewards or punishes them accordingly.

The pilot episode introduces several characters who make recurring appearances throughout the series. Big Smith&#x27;s moll Dixie Cousins (Kelly Rutherford) is a saloon singer and con artist who has a brief romantic encounter with Brisco. In later episodes, Dixie becomes Brisco&#x27;s primary love interest. In his first mission, Brisco also meets Professor Albert Wickwire (John Astin), an eccentric scientist who returns to help many times during the series. Wickwire&#x27;s ideas and inventions play into Brisco&#x27;s interest in technology and the future, something Brisco calls &quot;The Coming Thing&quot;. Pete Hutter (John Pyper-Ferguson) is a hapless mercenary working for Bly. He has a compulsive attachment to his &quot;piece&quot; (pistol), and given any opportunity will pontificate about topics such as art and philosophy. Pete appears throughout the series as a comic foil to trade barbs with the heroes. He appears to be killed three times during the series, but returns each time with a comic excuse for why he didn&#x27;t die. The second half of the series includes many episodes with Whip Morgan (Jeff Phillips), a young cardsharp whose attempts to assist Brisco and Bowler often end up causing trouble.

===Signature show elements===
The show features classic Western motifs such as train robberies and gunfighter showdowns, in combination with atypical elements. Much of the series is devoted to the science fiction plot surrounding the Orb, and it is this mix of the Western genre with fantasy that has helped &quot;Brisco&quot; maintain its cult status. In almost every episode, the characters discover or are confronted by what is, for the time, fantastic technology. In the pilot episode, Brisco and Professor Wickwire modify a rocket to run on train tracks. In the episode &quot;Brisco For the Defense&quot;, Brisco uses a slide projector to show a trial jury fingerprint evidence. Professor Wickwire returns many times in the series to assist with technology, including tinkering with motorcycles and rescuing the heroes with a helium-filled zeppelin. Campbell told &quot;Starlog&quot; magazine, &quot;It&#x27;s kind of Jules Verne meets &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;.&quot; The presence of futuristic technology in a Victorian era Western places the series in the steampunk genre; it is one of the few such shows to have aired on prime-time television. At least one-third of the show&#x27;s episodes contain steampunk or Weird West elements. Though &quot;technology-out-of-time&quot; frequently intrudes into the plots of &quot;Brisco&quot;, the fantastic machines or methods rarely appear again. Some of these out-of-time technologies were archaic renderings of those prevalent in the 20th century, and two film researchers, Cynthia Miller and A. Bowdoin Van Riper, suggest that followers of the show may be puzzled that such inventions, so useful in their own lives, are not exploited further.

According to Cuse, the show was purposely set in 1893, exactly 100 years before the series premiered in 1993. Brisco is meant to be aware of the imminent changes in society and technology and actively looks for them. The writers of the show, and also the character of Brisco, refer to this concept as &quot;The Coming Thing&quot;. Elaborating on this theme, Campbell said, &quot;Basically this show is about the turn of the century, when the Old West met the Industrial Era. Cowboys still chew tobacco and ride the range and states are still territories, but over the horizon is the onset of electricity, the first autos and telephones. Brisco is in the middle of a transition from the past to the future.&quot; The collision of cowboy characters with puzzling technology and other anachronisms generates humor throughout the series. The writers made it a point to insert scenes mirroring the pop culture of the 20th century, from the apparent invention of the term &quot;UFO&quot; in the pilot episode to the appearance of a sheriff who looks and acts like Elvis Presley. Speaking about the humor of the show, Campbell said, &quot;I would say 30 percent of each episode is being played for laughs. But it&#x27;s not a winking at the camera, &quot;Airplane&quot;-type of humor. We&#x27;re funny like &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; is funny; the laughs come primarily from the wide variety of ridiculous, colorful characters that come in and out of this series.&quot;

==Cast and Characters==
===Main===

*Brisco County, Jr., portrayed by Bruce Campbell, a Harvard-educated lawyer-turned-bounty hunter, hired by a group of robber barons to track down notorious outlaw John Bly, who killed County&#x27;s father, famous lawman Brisco County, Sr. (portrayed in the pilot by R. Lee Ermey). Bruce Campbell went through five auditions for the role of Brisco before he was hired. In his first audition with the casting director, Campbell spontaneously did a standing flip. The stunt impressed the casting director so much that during each subsequent audition, Campbell was asked to do the flip again. In his final audition, Campbell assured the network executives that if hired for the role, he would work hard to make the show a success. In an interview, Campbell said, &quot;It&#x27;s every actor&#x27;s dream to play a cowboy, so when this opportunity came up, I mean, yeah, where do I sign?&quot; He added that working on &quot;Brisco&quot; provided him with acting opportunities he would not have otherwise had. Cuse said getting Campbell &quot;was just one of those collisions between an actor and a script that was just perfect ... I can&#x27;t imagine Brisco having ever existed without him.&quot; Writing in &quot;Auxiliary Magazine&quot;, Luke Copping claimed that Brisco was Campbell&#x27;s &quot;last great&quot; role before the actor fell into &quot;a period of self-parody and overt camp that he did not redeem himself from until joining the cast of &quot;Burn Notice&quot;&quot;.
*Socrates Poole, portrayed by Christian Clemenson, a lawyer in the employ of the robber barons who hired County, sent to supervise him. Clemenson went to Harvard with Cuse but still went through the normal audition channels to get the part of Poole. Clemenson was apprehensive about pursuing one of the lead roles in a television show because of the long time commitments involved. He later said, &quot;The similarities between this show and &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, and my character to that show&#x27;s Artemus Gordon, was an important hook for me. It was one of my favorite shows growing up, and as soon as I saw that &quot;Brisco County&quot; was based on the same kind of material and attitude as that show, I called my agent and said, &#x27;I&#x27;ll do anything I have to do to get this. Clemenson applied his experiences at Ivy League schools to play the uptight Poole. Praising Clemenson&#x27;s work on &quot;Brisco&quot;, Cuse said, &quot;You can&#x27;t give him anything he&#x27;s not capable of doing. He adds the voice of intelligence and caution to balance our cast&quot;.
*Lord Bowler, portrayed by Julius Carry, an ill-tempered bounty hunter who is a competitor and occasional collaborator with County. Carry saw great potential in the character of Bowler. He had researched black cowboys for a project in college and used that knowledge in his portrayal of Bowler. Carry said that Bowler was similar to the real-life black deputy U.S. Marshal Bass Reeves, in that &quot;Reeves always got his man and would often pull off incredible tricks to bring people in.&quot; Carry knew Clemenson from the time they worked together on the Western television pilot &quot;Independence&quot;. He had no knowledge of Campbell, but approved of the choice for the leading man after watching &quot;Army of Darkness&quot;. He later told &quot;Starlog&quot;, &quot;I saw that he would be very good with the physical stuff and that he could deliver a one-liner. I knew the situation would be good.&quot; The original direction for Bowler was to have him constantly oppose Brisco, but as the series progressed the writers saw the good-natured chemistry between the actors and decided to make Brisco and Bowler a team. Bowler&#x27;s race was never an issue in the show. According to Cary Darling, a television critic, this attitude is different from serious Westerns and &quot;may hew more to the truth than one might think&quot;. He said historians have noted that black cowboys were common and that conflicts with white cowboys were rare.
*Dixie Cousins, portrayed by Kelly Rutherford, a sultry saloon singer and con artist who serves as County&#x27;s love interest. Rutherford&#x27;s portrayal of Dixie Cousins, with her emphasis on innuendo and subtext, has been described as &quot;less Miss Kitty (&quot;Gunsmoke&quot;) than Mae West&quot;. Rutherford said that playing Dixie allowed her to fulfill her &quot;fantasy of being Madeline Kahn in &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;&quot;.

===Recurring===

*Professor Albert Wickwire, portrayed by John Astin, an eccentric chemist, physicist, and “experimentalist” who assists County in is adventures and seeks to learn more about the Orb. Astin was cast he was best known for his portrayal of Gomez Addams in &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. Cuse said that he and the writers enjoyed paying homage to the television star of their childhoods: &quot;For us, it was like, &#x27;Oh wow, we get to meet John Astin in the guise of employing him on this show!
*John Bly, portrayed by Billy Drago, a flamboyant and psychotic outlaw who turns out to be a fugitive from the distant future who has traveled to 1893 to steal the Orb.
*Petter Hutter, portrayed by John Pyper-Ferguson, one of Bly&#x27;s henchmen, often serving as a comic foil.

==Production==

===Conception and development===
In 1989, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; was released in the cinemas. It was a commercial success, earning its producers US$115 million from domestic screenings. The action-packed story, unfolding in a manner reminiscent of Saturday matinee movie serials, about the adventures of an archaeologist was written by Jeffrey Boam, with development and story help from Carlton Cuse; this film was their third collaboration, after &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;. According to Cuse, Bob Greenblatt, an executive at Fox Broadcasting Company, engaged him and Boam to develop a television series &quot;because of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;&quot;. Greenblatt wanted a show that had a style similar to the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movies. Cuse started watching old serials and noticed that many fell into two genres: Westerns and science fiction. This gave Boam and Cuse the idea to combine the genres. They decided to emulate the serials&#x27; style; for example, each act within an episode begins with a title, usually a pun, and ends with a cliffhanger.

Boam and Cuse did not intend for the series to be historically accurate. Their aim was to create an action-adventure with a modern feel. Cuse told &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re not approaching this show as if we were doing a period piece. We see it as a contemporary program. Our characters just happen to be living in the West with 1990s sensibilities. The &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movies were period pieces too, but you never thought of them that way.&quot; Anachronisms and pop culture references were intentionally inserted into the series. The show was intended to be family friendly, so violence was minimized in favor of having Brisco think his way out of dangerous situations. Boam said, &quot;In the two-hour pilot Brisco doesn&#x27;t even once have to shoot his gun. Our violence is cartoonish. There is no pain and suffering.&quot; Bruce Campbell was prominently featured in advertisements, billboards, and even a trailer shown in movie theaters. When the series was being promoted in the summer of 1993, Fox Entertainment chief Sandy Grushow said that if Campbell &quot;isn&#x27;t the next big television star, I&#x27;ll eat my desk&quot;.

===Writing===
Cuse served as show runner and head writer. Boam, who served as executive producer, also contributed scripts for the show. The writing staff included John Wirth, Brad Kern, Tom Chehak, David Simkins, and John McNamara. They followed Cuse&#x27;s informal instruction that the tone of the show remain &quot;just under over-the-top&quot;: the series would be humorous but not too campy. Every member of the staff participated in breaking down and analyzing the stories they conceived. Worth commented, &quot;there was a very high percentage of ideas that worked in the room and got translated to paper that worked when you put them on film. That doesn&#x27;t always happen.&quot; Cuse described long hours writing the show, including several overnight sessions. Each episode of &quot;Brisco&quot; was filmed in seven days, so the turn-around time for scripts was one week. McNamara said that he became a &quot;student of TV history&quot; while writing for &quot;Brisco&quot;, reviewing old episodes of &quot;Maverick&quot; for inspiration on using humor in the Western genre. He said the writing team felt the television audience was ready for a &quot;trans-genre form&quot;, because much of the audience grew up with &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;. Researchers Lynnette Porter and Barry Porter acknowledge the writer&#x27;s familiarity with Mark Twain&#x27;s novel &quot;Pudd&#x27;nhead Wilson&quot;. Porter and Porter describe the novel as an &quot;ancestor text&quot;, because the characters of Brisco and Bly both refer to it, and say that this type of literary device is used again by Cuse in &quot;Lost&quot;.

One of the challenges the writers faced was scaling down their ideas to make them feasible for production. Cuse said that he let such ideas flourish because of his relative inexperience with writing for television series. An example given by the writers was Boam&#x27;s idea for a full-sized &quot;pirate ship on wheels&quot;. The writers quickly realized they needed to scale the idea down to something the production designers could create. They settled on putting a full pirate crew on a stagecoach with cannons. Kern said it was better to &quot;shoot past the mark, and come back to it, rather than start below it&quot;. He elaborated on this, saying, &quot;if you envision the 40-foot galleon and go back from that, you&#x27;ll always end up with more than if you start out with a pirate on a horse.&quot;

As the series progressed during its broadcast season, the writers received frequent notes and directives from Fox network executives calling for increases and decreases in the science-fiction, comedy and traditional Western elements. Cuse said, &quot;I think we did a particularly good job of maintaining continuity with all the schizophrenic notes we were getting from the network.&quot; However, midway through the first season, the writers made a thematic shift from science-fiction to more comedy and adventure. Cuse said, &quot;We were biting off more than we could chew... we were trying to do a comedic action adventure Western, with tongue-in-cheek humor, genuine drama, plus science fiction. All these things added too many elements to serve simultaneously.&quot; By the final third of the series, the writers had wrapped up the science-fiction plot with the Orb and focused more on traditional Western motifs.

===Production design===
&quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot;, was filmed primarily on the Warner Bros. soundstages. Town and street scenes were staged on the Western backlot, known as Laramie Street. It was one of the last Western shows to use the backlot. Cuse said that logistics were a problem because so many of the Hollywood Western sets and towns had been torn down by the 1990s. Outdoor scenes were shot on the Warner Bros. ranch in Valencia, California; Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles; and the Valuze Ranch in Santa Clarita, California. Some of the locomotive scenes from &quot;Brisco&quot; were filmed on location at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown, California. A painting used in the show as a backdrop to create illusions of greater depth perspectives is exhibited at the park.
Comet was portrayed by five horses, each with a different talent. The main horse was Copper, chosen by veteran wrangler Gordon Spencer because it was calm and gentle. Campbell nicknamed the horse &quot;Leadbelly&quot; due to its ability to remain calm during action or dialogue scenes. Another horse, Boss, was used for long-range shots, chase scenes, and elaborate stunts, such as leaps through windows. Ace was called in when the crew had to shoot scenes in which the horse reared. Near the end of the season, a horse named Comet was trained, its name chosen so that the horse would get used to hearing it on set. The &quot;true show horse&quot; was Strip, which was adept at doing tricks, such as lip movements, head nods, and hoof stamping. According to Spencer, all those stunts &quot;as well as tying the knots and opening the door and going into rooms and all of that&quot; were done by Strip. For these scenes, Spencer would stand off-camera and use a stick to signal Strip. Campbell had a special pocket sewn into his costume and filled it with grain to reward Strip after every take. No other horse had more scenes than Strip and Copper. With white colorings on his nose and legs, Strip&#x27;s appearance was chosen for Brisco&#x27;s steed; Copper and the other horses were touched up with &quot;clown white&quot; greasepaint to match Strip&#x27;s markings.

Foley artist Casey Crabtree provided sounds for horse hoof movements, work that was praised by sounds effects industry expert David Yewdall. He said of Crabtree&#x27;s work on &quot;Brisco&quot;, &quot;Her horses sounded so natural and real – their hooves, the sound of their hooves on the texture of the ground, the sound of saddle movement, bridle jingles – it was as good as anything I would want for a feature film, and this was episodic television.&quot; The make-up on many of &quot;Brisco&quot;&#x27;s episodes was done by veteran artist Mel Berns Jr.

Two props of the Orb were made. One of the prop Orbs was used for stunts and had retractable rods. A second version was manufactured from cast bronze, making it heavy: &quot;You really didn&#x27;t want to have to handle it,&quot; Campbell said. The rocket car seen in the pilot episode was built by special effects coordinator Kam Cooney and was a working vehicle with an internal combustion engine and throttle controls. Some items used in the show had been repurposed from older productions, and some would later be used in other shows. For example, the steam locomotive seen in the pilot episode was the same as the one used in &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;. Two of Carry&#x27;s prop guns – rifles whose barrels were sawed-off in fashion of the Mare&#x27;s Leg – were later reused in the science fiction television series &quot;Firefly&quot;.

===Music===
Stephen Graziano and Velton Ray Bunch composed original music for the series.

Composed by Randy Edelman, the distinctive theme music gained recognition beyond the show&#x27;s following; in the mid-1990s, NBC Sports had commissioned Edelman to compose theme music for its NFL coverage. At the time, NBC had often used excerpts from film scores as theme music for its sports broadcasts, and had used a portion of Edelman&#x27;s &quot;Gettysburg&quot; score for the Breeder&#x27;s Cup. A portfolio Edelman sent NBC included the &quot;Brisco&quot; theme, and by 1996 it was being used during coverage of the Olympics; the theme would be retired after the 2016 games. NBC used it again as the theme for their coverage of the 1996 World Series and 1997 World Series. Edelman said, &quot;It was original, and it seemed to have the right spirit. It&#x27;s got a very flowing melody, it&#x27;s triumphant, and it has a certain warmth. And it has at the end of it, what all television things like this have, a &#x27;button&#x27;, an ending flourish that works really well if they need to chop it down into a 15-second thing.&quot;

Cary Darling said that the &quot;booming&quot; theme song was &quot;part &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot;, part Aaron Copland and as grand and wide as &#x27;Big Sky Country&#x27; &quot;.

&quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot;, premiered on the Fox network at 8:00 pm on Friday, August 27, 1993, with a two-hour pilot movie. To bolster viewer interest in the show, Fox rebroadcast the pilot two days later at 7:00 pm. Both airings of the pilot returned strong ratings. &quot;Brisco&#x27;s&quot; ratings for the pilot and first episode were high, particularly with the demographic of adults aged 18–49. The series was aired in Canada, including on Global Toronto (channel 29).

The pilot movie was followed by 26 episodes, each 45 minutes long and airing at 8:00 pm on Fridays. Fox Entertainment chief Sandy Grushaw openly touted &quot;Brisco&quot; and its star Bruce Campbell. The network fully expected the show to be its breakout hit of the year, a distinction which eventually went to &quot;Brisco&quot;″s follow-up, &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Hoping that more viewers would follow &quot;Brisco&quot; as it progressed, Fox approved producing an entire season of the show, despite post-pilot low ratings. Subsequent episodes failed to attract more viewers and the show was cancelled at end of its first and only season. After the series ended, Fox retransmitted the show on Sunday nights at 8:00 pm during July and August 1994. The show was later broadcast for a short time in syndication, airing on the U.S. cable channel TNT.

===Cancellation===
As the season progressed, the ratings declined, greatly hurting the show&#x27;s chances of being renewed. Writer John McNamara partially blamed &quot;Brisco&quot;″s low ratings on its Friday 8:00 p.m. time slot. He said not many people watch television at that time, so &quot;fighting for numbers&quot; then was &quot;like being stuck on Normandy beach&quot;. Grushaw acknowledged the high quality of the show and the vocal support from its small fan base. &quot;Obviously the viewers are very passionate about the show... and when you read some of the things they have to say, it gives you real pause&quot;, Grushaw told &quot;USA Today&quot; in 1994. By May of that year, Grushaw said renewing &quot;Brisco&quot; was a 50–50 call. At the end of its season, &quot;Brisco&quot; was one of the lowest rated shows of the year, and Fox confirmed its cancellation in June.

&quot;Brisco&quot;″s writers were planning for another season before the show&#x27;s cancellation. They had not penned the ending of the first season as a finale for the series and had broad ideas for the second season, which would have featured Brisco settling in as the sheriff of a small town. In his autobiography, Campbell mused, &quot;To explain why a TV show is canceled is almost impossible. Ironically &quot;Brisco&quot;, with its off-kilter humor, wouldn&#x27;t have been developed on any other network, yet the appeal of &#x27;Westerns&#x27; was still rural – not the side Fox&#x27;s urban bread was buttered on.&quot;

Writer and supervising producer Brad Kern reflected on the show&#x27;s cancellation, saying, &quot;Ten years later, everybody you talk to... they all love the show. I think that was the biggest disappointment about the show not coming back. We knew we were doing something special.&quot; Told of the show&#x27;s success in the &quot;TV Guide&quot; &quot;Save Our Shows&quot; poll, Sandy Grushow said, &quot;Obviously I&#x27;m happy and not entirely surprised&quot;, but added, &quot;You can&#x27;t dismiss a season&#x27;s worth of ratings.&quot; Kim Manners, director on nearly a third of the &quot;Brisco&quot; episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, &quot;It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually&quot;, and that directing for &quot;Brisco&quot; was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Manners said, &quot;When they didn&#x27;t give it a second year, I was devastated&quot;, adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on &quot;Brisco&quot;. Considering the show&#x27;s short life, Cuse later commented, &quot;If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, &quot;Brisco&quot; could have had a much longer life.&quot; Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt &quot;Brisco&quot;″s chances of building an audience, saying, &quot;We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which is sort of a death slot – I mean people do still go bowling – few shows have succeeded in that slot.&quot;

==Home media==
In 2005, Kirthana Ramisetti of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; posted that &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot;, deserved to be released on DVD. Gord Lacey, the creator of the website TVShowsonDVD.com, told the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; that &quot;Brisco&quot; was among the five most requested shows on the site. Lacey spent several years lobbying industry contacts to get &quot;Brisco&quot; released on DVD. This led to correspondence with Cuse, who also wanted to get a DVD set produced. On July 18, 2006, Warner Home Video released &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1, an 8-disc DVD set that contains all 27 episodes of the series. The release includes commentary tracks from Campbell and Cuse; an interactive menu of Brisco&#x27;s signature references narrated by Campbell; &quot;The History of Brisco County, Jr.&quot;, documentary; a feature called &quot;A Reading from the Book of Bruce&quot;; and another gallery hosted by Campbell focusing on the gadgets from the show.

==Reception==

===Pilot episode===
In July 1993, &quot;Brisco&quot;″s two-hour pilot was screened for television critics in Los Angeles. Initial critical reaction to the pilot was positive and focused on the humor and the science fiction plot points. &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Matt Roush enjoyed the campy humor and the cast of the show, saying it worked on many levels and would &quot;please all but the family curmudgeon&quot;. Calling &quot;Brisco&quot; &quot;one of the best shows of the fall season&quot;, Jennifer Stevenson of the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; praised the show&#x27;s &quot;intelligent, satirical asides&quot;. Kay Gardella wrote in the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; that the pilot set itself &quot;apart from others of genre&quot; with its humorous script and sight gags. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called &quot;Brisco&quot; &quot;gratifying nonsense&quot;, and praised Campbell and the supporting cast for supplying humor without &quot;going over the top&quot;. Some critics, such as Walter Goodman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and David Hiltbrand of &quot;People&quot;, found the supporting characters &quot;weakly cast&quot; and not as strong as Campbell in the lead. Other reviewers praised the overall look of the show, such as Todd Everett of &quot;Variety&quot;, who approved of the &quot;strong comic-book visual style&quot; and the pilot&#x27;s high production values. Writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Tom Shales said that the pilot&#x27;s production was &quot;more movielike than serieslike&quot;.

The pilot&#x27;s science-fiction plot elements were appreciated by &quot;New York&quot; magazine, which wrote favorably about the &quot;millenarianism&quot; of the show, including Brisco&#x27;s use of a rocket to travel on railroad tracks. While Rod Dreher of the &quot;Washington Times&quot; liked the &quot;nifty&quot; Orb subplot, some critics responded negatively to the Orb. The &quot;Washington Post&quot;″s Shales called the Orb &quot;hokey supernatural bunk&quot;. Other reviewers complained generally about the broad mix of genres and number of subplots in the pilot. While &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Jeff Jarvis roundly praised the quality of the pilot and called &quot;Brisco&quot; his favorite Fox show of 1993, he criticized the pilot for being &quot;padded with outlaws and mysterious orbs&quot;. Diane Werts of &quot;Newsday&quot; similarly said that &quot;Brisco&quot; &quot;just about hits the bulls eye&quot; with its &quot;sharp wit&quot; and &quot;thrill a minute&quot; action, although she noted that the pilot was over-packed with characters and subplots. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Goodman said, &quot;The writers try everything, including some business involving raiders of a lost orb, without much of a payoff.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Ken Tucker enjoyed the &quot;nervy attempt to do something different with the TV Western&quot; in the pilot and said that &quot;Brisco County is less a satire of the Western&#x27;s cliches than a revitalization of them.&quot; Writing in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Greg Quill said that the pilot introduced &quot;Brisco&quot; as &quot;a western in the loosest use of the term&quot;. Quill noted that the pilot includes &quot;every cliche in the western movie arsenal&quot;, but that &quot;everything, from characters to plot turns, is skewed away from the norm&quot;, and that the pilot episode rose above the level of western spoof to become an &quot;outrageously confident tribute to... the best of the genre&quot;.

===Broadcast run===
During the broadcast run of &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot;, &quot;TV Guide&quot; featured a positive review of the show in its Couch Critic column and wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s as funny as it is exciting, which is not an easy combo to pull off... it&#x27;s fresh and funny and different, and that&#x27;s why we like it.&quot; The magazine twice listed &quot;Brisco&quot; as a family-friendly TV program: &quot;Back when some of us grew up, Westerns were synonymous with great family entertainment, but – let&#x27;s be honest – some of them were dull as dust. Not this one. &quot;Brisco&quot; is a Western with a sense of humor, filled with impish action for kids and adults.&quot;

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reviewed a host of Westerns from 1992 and 1993 and said that &quot;Brisco&quot; was &quot;the most sheer fun of the bunch&quot;, calling it &quot;a period piece with slick production values and a mix of drama and humor, fast pace and high camp&quot;. In an article on the 1993 television season, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;″s Greg Quill wrote that &quot;Brisco&quot; was a program that represented &quot;American TV craft at the top of its form&quot;. In contrast, Elvis Mitchell of &quot;Spin&quot; magazine gave &quot;Brisco&quot; a scathing review, calling the show&#x27;s premise a &quot;tedious... rickety gimmick&quot;. Mitchell acknowledged the show&#x27;s &quot;quick reflexes&quot;, but said the humor was &quot;uncomfortable&quot; with a &quot;cynical quickness&quot;. He added, &quot;&quot;Brisco County&quot; relieves us of the burden of laughing. It spends too much time looking at itself in the mirror, admiring its own adorable dimpled half-smile.&quot;

Viewership figures for &quot;Brisco&quot; fell as its season progressed and in 1994, it was listed in &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s annual &quot;Save Our Shows&quot; article. Readers were requested to write in and vote to save one of the four listed shows – one from each television network – that were in danger of being cancelled. &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot;, won with 34.7 percent of the 72,000 votes cast. Cuse said the vote &quot;reaffirms for me a feeling I&#x27;ve had – namely that the Nielsens aren&#x27;t accurately reflecting people&#x27;s interest in this show&quot;, adding that, given Fox&#x27;s then relatively small share of the market, it was notable that the show got more votes than any of the programs from NBC, CBS, and ABC.

Writing in &quot;USA Today&quot;, Matt Roush encouraged readers to watch the low-rated show, saying that families should watch it rather than &quot;that interchangeable T.G.I.F. tripe&quot;. He said, &quot;Brisco is mighty lavish but even more mightily loony, happily saddled with broad sight gags and tortured puns.&quot; Bruce Fretts of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; speculated that mainstream success eluded the show because of its mixing of genres. He said, &quot;&quot;Brisco&quot; refuses to behave like a normal Western, mixing in sci-fi, slapstick, and... kung fu.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&#x27;s Scott Williams praised &quot;Brisco&quot; for its &quot;strong supporting cast&quot; and &quot;superb physical comedy and crisp dialogue&quot;. He said the show should have been a hit, but that the Friday night time slot hampered its ratings.

===Level of violence===
&quot;Brisco&quot; was criticized early on for the violence it portrayed; meant to be comical, a scene in the pilot in which four villains accidentally kill each other in a crossfire troubled critics instead. Cuse insisted that the show was still appropriate for children, saying, &quot;I think we&#x27;re very conscious of violence and I think we&#x27;ve made an effort to avoid violence in the pilot and in the future episodes&quot;. Halfway through the season, U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan singled out &quot;Brisco&quot; as the most violent show on television based on a study at Minnesota&#x27;s Concordia University, in which students watched 132 hours of network and cable programming, during the week of September 28 to October 4, 1993. The students tallied each act of violence, and found that &quot;Brisco&quot; had 117 violent acts per hour. The study deemed &quot;Brisco&quot; more violent than the film &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, which was also viewed for the study. Cuse called the criticism &quot;patently ridiculous&quot;, noting that only one episode of the show was viewed, in which a boxing match takes place. Each punch and jab was counted as an act of violence. Cuse spoke out against legislation to curb television violence, saying that politicians were &quot;chasing a false objective&quot;. He said it was the job of a show&#x27;s producer to control the moral content of a television program and the parents&#x27; duty to monitor what their children watch.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; printed a story about Senator Dorgan&#x27;s efforts to elicit a response from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with the title &quot;Fox Tops Tally of Violence on Major TV Networks Media: Study of a week of prime-time shows also lists &#x27;Brisco County&#x27; as bloodiest series. Senator wants FCC to issue report card, name sponsors&quot;. Cuse responded by writing a letter to the editor. In the letter, entitled &quot;&#x27;Brisco County&#x27; Is a Family-Oriented Series&quot;, Cuse objected to the newspaper story title labeling &quot;Brisco&quot; as the &quot;bloodiest series&quot;. He said that Senator Dorgan&#x27;s press release did not mention blood and that the show&#x27;s violence should be viewed in context. Cuse added the show had been listed as family friendly in other publications, and that he read every viewer letter sent regarding the show. &quot;The overwhelming majority praise &quot;Brisco County&quot; for being a show that the entire family can watch together. After 15 original airings, I have not received one single letter criticizing the show on the grounds of violence or violent content.&quot; When the US Senate discussed forcing broadcast and cable networks to regulate violent programming, Cuse said that self-regulation within the industry was a positive move. As he operated on his &quot;own internal moral principles&quot;, the measures would not affect his week-to-week work.

===Post-cancellation===
Writing in &quot;People&quot; magazine in 1995, Craig Tomashoff said the cancellation of &quot;Brisco&quot; was &quot;one of the tragedies going into [the 1994–1995] TV season&quot;. Tomashoff suggested that the show influenced UPN&#x27;s &quot;Legend&quot;, another Western series with comedy and science fiction elements. Reflecting on the show in the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; in 1996, critic Cary Darling lamented &quot;Brisco&quot;&#x27;s cancellation, saying that the show &quot;stood way out from the rest of the broadcast pack&quot;. Darling reviewed the show, describing it as &quot;a witty, multiracial Western that tempered its fisticuffs with fantasy, its innocence with irony, and its romantic vision of the Old West with an abiding New World faith in the future&#x27;s infinite possibilities&quot;. Writing in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Ken Tucker called the show a &quot;one season wonder&quot; that was &quot;ahead of its time&quot;.

When the series was released on DVD, critics remembered it fondly. &quot;Video Librarian&quot; called &quot;Brisco&quot; &quot;criminally short-lived&quot; and &quot;wildly entertaining&quot;. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the series an &quot;A−&quot;, calling the show &quot;smart-alecky and witty, suspenseful and absurd&quot;. &quot;IGN DVD&quot; called the DVD set &quot;impressive&quot; and said that the series was &quot;a satisfying show that hits its mark&quot;. &quot;Auxiliary Magazine&quot; called &quot;Brisco&quot; &quot;one of the greatest sci-fi/Western epics in television history&quot; and compared it favorably to the more well-known sci-fi/Western shows, &quot;Firefly&quot; and &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;. In its 2006 gift guide, the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; gave &quot;Brisco&quot; a positive review, saying, &quot;Folks, there are so few comic sci-fi/Westerns, they should be celebrated, not canceled prematurely.&quot;

In a 2018 interview with &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, Bruce Campbell voiced an interest in reviving the series. &quot;I would actually be willing to do a Brisco revisited&quot;.

<text>Loudun (; ; Poitevin: &quot;Loudin&quot;) is a commune in the Vienne department and the region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, western France.

It is located south of the town of Chinon and 25 km to the east of the town Thouars. The area south of Loudun is the place of origin of a significant portion of the Acadians, one of the early settlers of New France in Canada.

==Demographics==
==Sights==
Loudun, an ancient town, contains numerous old streets, buildings and monuments of which five are Government-listed monuments. It is also the location of a vicus type archaeological site.

==History==
* The Treaty of Loudun, negotiated and signed in Loudun on May 3, 1616, temporarily resolved the power struggle for control of the French government between the Prince of Condé (next in line for Louis XIII&#x27;s throne) and queen mother Marie de Medici&#x27;s favorite Concino Concini, Marquis of Ancre. 
* Loudun was also the site of mass hysteria surrounding the supposed mass possession of Ursuline nuns by the Devil in 1634 (see Loudun possessions).

==Loudun in art==
* Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz&#x27;s 1942 (published in 1946) short story which transposes the story to Poland
* Eyvind Johnson&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;Drömmar om rosor och eld&quot; was based on the Loudun possessions.
* Aldous Huxley&#x27;s 1952 non-fiction novel &quot;The Devils of Loudun&quot; was also based on the Loudun possessions.
* John Whiting&#x27;s 1961 theatre play &quot;The Devils&quot;, commissioned by Sir Peter Hall for the Royal Shakespeare Company, was based on Aldous Huxley&#x27;s novel.
* A Polish film, &quot;Mother Joan of the Angels&quot; (1961), is based on Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz short story.
* Krzysztof Penderecki&#x27;s 1969 opera &quot;The Devils of Loudun&quot; (&quot;Die Teufel von Loudun&quot;), which premiered at the Hamburg State Opera, was based on Huxley&#x27;s novel and Whiting&#x27;s play.
* Ken Russell&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;The Devils&quot; was based on Huxley&#x27;s novel and Whiting&#x27;s play.

==Notable people==
Loudun is the birthplace of:
* Jean Salmon Macrin (1490–1557), Neo-Latin poet
* Théophraste Renaudot (1586–1653), medical practitioner, inventor of the French written press, journalist, and philanthropist
* Ismaël Bullialdus (1604–1694), astronomer
* Jean-Charles Cornay, martyr.
* Marie Besnard, accused of poisoning in the 1950s in what was a very mediatized trial; her story was the subject of a successful TV movie and several books
* René Monory, mayor of Loudun, senator of Vienne, president of the French Senate, Minister of Education, president of the Vienne General Council, and founder of the Futuroscope Park of Poitiers
* Nicolas Ghesquière (born 1972), creative director of the French fashion house Balenciaga was born in 1972 in Comines, Nord-Pas-de-Calais but was always raised in Loudun where his parents own a golf course.

Loudun is the place of death of:
* Urbain Grandier (18 August 1634), French Catholic priest who was burned at the stake after being convicted of witchcraft.
* André Andrejew (16 March 1967), French-Russian classic film production designer, built decor for movies produced in Germany, France, England and the US.

More recent entries in the Western genre have used the neo-Western subgenre, placing events in the modern day, or the space Western subgenre but still draw inspiration from the outlaw attitudes prevalent in traditional Western productions.

When television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, TV Westerns quickly became an audience favorite, with 30 such shows airing at prime time by 1959. Traditional Westerns faded in popularity in the late 1960s, while new shows fused Western elements with other types of shows, such as family drama, mystery thrillers, and crime drama. In the 1990s and 2000s, slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced.

<text>Johann Joachim Winckelmann ( ; ; 9 December 17178 June 1768) was a German art historian and archaeologist. He was a pioneering Hellenist who first articulated the differences between Greek, Greco-Roman and Roman art. &quot;The prophet and founding hero of modern archaeology&quot;, Winckelmann was one of the founders of scientific archaeology and first applied the categories of style on a large, systematic basis to the history of art. Many consider him the father of the discipline of art history. He was one of the first to separate Greek Art into periods, and time classifications.

He had a decisive influence on the rise of the Neoclassical movement during the late 18th century. His writings influenced not only a new science of archaeology and art history but Western painting, sculpture, literature and even philosophy. Winckelmann&#x27;s &quot;History of Ancient Art&quot; (1764) was one of the first books written in German to become a classic of European literature. His subsequent influence on Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Johann Gottfried Herder, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Hölderlin, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Nietzsche, Stefan George and Oswald Spengler has been provocatively called &quot;the Tyranny of Greece over Germany&quot;.

Winckelmann was homosexual, and open homoeroticism informed his writings on aesthetics. In 1752, he mentioned the &quot;lust&quot; which could be experienced with the &quot;divine monarch&quot; (i.e. Frederick the Great) in Potsdam in a similar way as in &quot;Athens and Sparta&quot;, and which he could enjoy so immensely that he would never again be allowed to. His homosexuality was recognized by his contemporaries, such as Goethe. In 1768, at the age of 50, he was murdered by a fellow guest at his hotel for reasons that remain unclear.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Winckelmann was born in poverty in Stendal in the Margraviate of Brandenburg. His father, Martin Winckelmann, worked as a cobbler, while his mother, Anna Maria Meyer, was the daughter of a weaver. Winckelmann&#x27;s early years were full of hardship, but his academic interests pushed him forward. Later in Rome, when he had become a famous scholar, he wrote: &quot;One gets spoiled here; but God owed me this; in my youth I suffered too much.&quot;

Winckelmann attended the Köllnisches Gymnasium in Berlin and the Altstädtisches Gymnasium at Salzwedel, and in 1738, at the age of 21, went as a student of theology to the University of Halle. However, Winckelmann was no theologian; he had become interested in Greek classics in his youth, but soon realized that the teachers in Halle could not satisfy his intellectual interests in this field. He nonetheless devoted himself privately to Greek and followed the lectures of Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten, who coined the term &quot;aesthetics&quot;. During this period, he became an enthusiastic translator of Herodotus.

With the intention of becoming a physician, in 1740 Winckelmann attended medical classes at Jena. He also taught languages. From 1743 to 1748, he was the deputy headmaster of the gymnasium of Seehausen in the Altmark but Winckelmann felt that work with children was not his true calling. Moreover, his means were insufficient: his salary was so low that he had to rely on his students&#x27; parents for free meals. He was thus obliged to accept a tutorship near Magdeburg. Whilst working as a tutor for the powerful Lamprecht family, he fell into unrequited love with the handsome Lamprecht son. This was one of a series of such loves throughout his life. His enthusiasm for the male form excited Winckelmann&#x27;s budding admiration of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture.

===Count von Bünau&#x27;s librarian===
In 1748, Winckelmann wrote to Count Heinrich von Bünau: &quot;[L]ittle value is set on Greek literature, to which I have devoted myself so far as I could penetrate, when good books are so scarce and expensive&quot;. In the same year, Winckelmann was appointed secretary of von Bünau&#x27;s library at Nöthnitz, near Dresden. The library contained some 40,000 volumes. Winckelmann had read Homer, Herodotus, Sophocles, Xenophon, and Plato, but he found at Nöthnitz the works of such famous Enlightenment writers as Voltaire and Montesquieu. To leave behind the spartan atmosphere of Prussia came as a great relief for Winckelmann. His major duty involved assisting von Bünau in writing a book on the Holy Roman Empire and helping collect material for it; during this period he made several visits to the collection of antiquities at Dresden, but his description of its best paintings remained unfinished. The treasures there, nevertheless, awakened in Winckelmann an intense interest in art, which was deepened by his association with various artists, particularly the painter Adam Friedrich Oeser (1717–1799)—a future friend of and influence on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe—who encouraged Winckelmann in his aesthetic studies. (Winckelmann subsequently exercised a powerful influence over Goethe.)

In 1755, Winckelmann published his &quot;Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst&quot; (&quot;Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture&quot;), followed by a feigned attack on the work and a defense of its principles, ostensibly by an impartial critic. The &quot;Gedanken&quot; contains the first statement of the doctrines he afterwards developed, the ideal of &quot;noble simplicity and quiet grandeur&quot; (&quot;edle Einfalt und stille Größe&quot;) and the definitive assertion, &quot;[t]he one way for us to become great, perhaps inimitable, is by imitating the ancients&quot;. The work won warm admiration not only for the ideas it contained, but for its literary style. It made Winckelmann famous, and was reprinted several times and soon translated into French. In England, Winckelmann&#x27;s views stirred discussion in the 1760s and 1770s, although it was limited to artistic circles: Henry Fuseli&#x27;s English translation, entitled &quot;Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks&quot;, was published in 1765, and reprinted with corrections in 1767.

===Rome===
In 1751, the papal nuncio in Saxony, Alberico Archinto, visited Nöthnitz and was highly impressed by Winckelmann. In 1754 Winckelmann converted to the Roman Catholic Church. Goethe concluded that Winckelmann was a pagan, while Gerhard Gietmann contended that Winckelmann &quot;died a devout and sincere Catholic&quot;; either way, his conversion ultimately opened the doors of the papal library to him. On the strength of the &quot;Gedanken über die Nachahmung der Griechischen Werke&quot;, Augustus III, king of Poland and elector of Saxony, granted him a pension of 200 thalers, so that he could continue his studies in Rome.

Winckelmann arrived in Rome in November 1755. His first task there was to describe the statues in the Cortile del Belvedere—the &quot;Apollo Belvedere&quot;, the &quot;Laocoön&quot;, the so-called &quot;Antinous&quot;, and the &quot;Belvedere Torso&quot;—which represented to him the &quot;utmost perfection of ancient sculpture&quot;.

Originally, Winckelmann planned to stay in Italy only two years with the help of the grant from Dresden, but the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763) changed his plans. He was named librarian to Cardinal Passionei, who was impressed by Winckelmann&#x27;s beautiful Greek writing and showed him much kindness. Winckelmann also became librarian to Alberico Archinto, who had returned to Rome and become Cardinal Archinto. After the deaths of the two cardinals, Winckelmann was hired as librarian in the house of Alessandro Cardinal Albani, who was forming his magnificent collection of antiquities in the villa at Porta Salaria.

With the aid of his new friend, the painter Anton Raphael Mengs (1728–79), with whom he first lived in Rome, Winckelmann devoted himself to the study of Roman antiquities and gradually acquired an unrivalled knowledge of ancient art. Winckelmann&#x27;s method of careful observation allowed him to identify Roman copies of Greek art, something that was unusual at that time—Roman culture was considered the ultimate achievement of Antiquity. His friend Mengs became the channel through which Winckelmann&#x27;s ideas were realized in art and spread around Europe. (&quot;The only way for us to become great, yes, inimitable, if it is possible, is the imitation of the Greeks&quot;, Winckelmann declared in the &quot;Gedanken&quot;. With imitation he did not mean slavish copying: &quot;... what is imitated, if handled with reason, may assume another nature, as it were, and become one&#x27;s own&quot;). Neoclassical artists attempted to revive the spirit as well as the forms of ancient Greece and Rome. Mengs&#x27;s contribution in this was considerable—he was widely regarded as the greatest living painter of his day. The French painter Jacques-Louis David met Mengs in Rome (1775–80) and was introduced through him to the artistic theories of Winckelmann. Earlier, while in Rome, Winckelmann met the Scottish architect Robert Adam, whom he influenced to become a leading proponent of neoclassicism in architecture. Winckelmann&#x27;s ideals were later popularized in England through the reproductions of Josiah Wedgwood&#x27;s &quot;Etruria&quot; factory (1782).

In 1760, Winckelmann&#x27;s &quot;Description des pierres gravées du feu Baron de Stosch&quot; [Description of incised gems of the late Baron of Stosch] appeared, followed in 1762 by his &quot;Anmerkungen über die Baukunst der Alten&quot; (&quot;Observations on the Architecture of the Ancients&quot;), which included an account of the temples at Paestum. In 1758 and 1762, he visited Naples to observe the archaeological excavations being conducted at Pompeii and Herculaneum. &quot;Despite his association with Albani, Winckelmann steered clear of the shady world of art dealing which had compromised the scholarly respectability of such brilliant, if much less systematic antiquarians as Francesco Ficoroni and the Baron Stosch.&quot; Winckelmann&#x27;s poverty may have played a part: the trade in antiquities was an expensive and speculative game. In 1763, with Albani&#x27;s advocacy, he was appointed Pope Clement XIII&#x27;s Prefect of Antiquities.

From 1763, while retaining his position with Albani, Winckelmann worked as a prefect of antiquities (Prefetto delle Antichità) and scriptor (Scriptor linguae teutonicae) of the Vatican. Winckelmann visited Naples again, in 1765 and 1767, and wrote for the use of the electoral prince and princess of Saxony his &quot;Briefe an Bianconi&quot;, which were published, eleven years after his death, in the &quot;Antologia romana&quot;.

Winckelmann contributed various essays to the &quot;Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften&quot;; and, in 1766, published his &quot;Versuch einer Allegorie&quot;. Of much greater importance was the work entitled &quot;Monumenti antichi inediti&quot; (&quot;Unpublished monuments of antiquity&quot;, 1767–1768), prefaced by a &quot;Trattato preliminare&quot;, which presented a general sketch of the history of art. The plates in this work are representations of objects which had either been falsely explained or not explained at all. Winckelmann&#x27;s explanations were of tremendous use to the future science of archaeology, by showing through observational method that the ultimate sources of inspiration of many works of art supposed to be connected with Roman history were to be found in Homer.

===Masterwork===

Winckelmann&#x27;s masterpiece, the &quot;Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums&quot; (&quot;The History of Art in Antiquity&quot;), published in 1764, was soon recognized as a permanent contribution to European literature. In this work, &quot;Winckelmann&#x27;s most significant and lasting achievement was to produce a thorough, comprehensive and lucid chronological account of all antique art—including that of the Egyptians and Etruscans.&quot; This was the first work to define in the art of a civilization an organic growth, maturity, and decline. Here, it included the revelatory tale told by a civilization&#x27;s art and artifacts—these, if we look closely, tell us their own story of cultural factors, such as climate, freedom, and craft. Winckelmann sets forth both the history of Greek art &quot;and of Greece&quot;. He presents a glowing picture of the political, social, and intellectual conditions which he believed tended to foster creative activity in ancient Greece.

The fundamental idea of Winckelmann&#x27;s artistic theories are that the goal of art is beauty, and that this goal can be attained only when individual and characteristic features are strictly subordinated to an artist&#x27;s general scheme. The true artist, selecting from nature the phenomena suited to his purpose and combining them through the exercise of his imagination, creates an ideal type in which normal proportions are maintained, and particular parts, such as muscles and veins, are not permitted to break the harmony of the general outlines.

===Death===
In 1768, Winckelmann journeyed north over the Alps, but Tyrol depressed him and he decided to return to Italy. However, his friend, the sculptor and restorer Bartolomeo Cavaceppi managed to persuade him to travel to Munich and Vienna, where he was received with honor by Maria Theresa. On his way back, he was murdered in Trieste on 8 June 1768, in a hotel bed by a fellow traveller, a man named Francesco Arcangeli. The true reason for the murder is not known. One hypothesis argues that the medals given to Winckelmann by the Empress Maria Theresa were the motive, but they were not stolen after the crime. Another possibility is that Arcangeli killed Winckelmann over homosexual advances, although Winckelmann had thought that Arcangeli was only &quot;&quot; (&quot;a man of little account&quot;). Arcangeli was executed a month later by breaking on the wheel outside the hotel in which both had been staying.

Winckelmann was buried in the churchyard of Trieste Cathedral. and documented the last week of Winckelmann&#x27;s life; Heinrich Alexander Stoll translated the Italian document, the so-called &quot;Mordakte Winckelmann&quot;, into German.

==Critical response and influence==
Winckelmann&#x27;s writings are key to understanding the modern European discovery of ancient (sometimes idealized) Greece, neoclassicism, and the doctrine of art as imitation (&quot;Nachahmung&quot;). The mimetic character of art that imitates but does not simply copy, as Winckelmann restated it, is central to any interpretation of Enlightenment classical idealism. Winckelmann stands at an early stage of the transformation of taste in the late 18th century.

Winckelmann&#x27;s study &quot;Sendschreiben von den Herculanischen Entdeckungen&quot; (&quot;Letter about the Discoveries at Herculaneum&quot;) was published in 1762, and two years later &quot;Nachrichten von den neuesten Herculanischen Entdeckungen&quot; (&quot;Report on the Latest Discoveries at Herculaneum&quot;). From these, scholars obtained their first real information about the excavations at Pompeii.

His major work, &quot;Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums&quot; (1764, &quot;The History of Ancient Art&quot;), deeply influenced contemporary views of the superiority of Greek art. It was translated into French in 1766 and later into English and Italian. Among others, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing based many of the ideas in his &quot;Laocoön&quot; (1766) on Winckelmann&#x27;s views on harmony and expression in the visual arts.

In the historical portions of his writings, Winckelmann used not only the works of art he himself had studied but the scattered notices on the subject to be found in ancient writers; and his wide knowledge and active imagination enabled him to offer many fruitful suggestions as to periods about which he had little direct information. To the still existing works of art, he applied a minute empirical scrutiny. Many of his conclusions, based on inadequate evidence of Roman copies, would be modified or reversed by subsequent researchers. Nonetheless, the fervid descriptive enthusiasm of passages in his work, its strong and yet graceful style, and its vivid descriptions of works of art gave it a most immediate appeal. It marked an epoch by indicating the spirit in which the study of Greek art and of ancient civilization should be approached, and the methods by which investigators might hope to attain solid results. To Winckelmann&#x27;s contemporaries it came as a revelation, and it exercised a profound influence on the best minds of the age. It was read with intense interest by Lessing, who found in the earliest of Winckelmann&#x27;s works the starting-point for his &quot;Laocoön&quot;, and by Herder, Goethe and Kant.

Winckelmann&#x27;s historical standing is best illustrated by the countless honors he received after his death. One of these is a medal published in a French medal series for illustrious men struck in 1819.

Today, Humboldt University of Berlin&#x27;s Winckelmann Institute is dedicated to the study of classical archaeology.

<text>Najaf is the capital city of the Najaf Governorate in central Iraq, about 160 km (99 mi) south of Baghdad. Its estimated population in 2024 is about 1.41 million people. It is widely considered amongst the holiest cities of Shia Islam and one of its spiritual capitals, as well as the center of Shia political power in Iraq.

It is the burial place of Muhammad&#x27;s son in law and cousin, ‘Alī ibn Abī Tālib, and thus a major pilgrimage destination for Shia Muslims. The largest cemetery in the world (Wadi-us-Salaam) and the oldest Shi&#x27;a Islamic seminary in the world (Hawza of Najaf) are located in Najaf.

== Etymology ==
According to Ibn Manzur, the word, &quot;najaf&quot; (), literally means a high and rectangular place around which water is accumulated, although the water does not go above its level. Al-Shaykh al-Saduq appeals to a hadith from Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, claiming that &quot;Najaf&quot; comes from the phrase, &quot;nay jaff&quot; which means &quot;the nay sea has dried&quot;.

&quot;Najaf&quot; is usually accompanied by the adjective &quot;al-Ashraf&quot; (the dignified). According to the author of &quot;al-Hawza al-&#x27;ilmiyya fi l-Najaf al-ashraf&quot;, this is because &#x27;Ali, one of the most dignified persons, is buried in the city.

Al-Ghari or al-Ghariyyan, Hadd al-&#x27;Adhra&#x27;, al-Hiwar, al-Judi, Wadi l-Salam, al-Zahr, Zahr al-Kufa (behind Kufa), al-Rabwa, Baniqiya, and Mashhad are other names for this land.

==History==
The area of An-Najaf is located 30 km (19 mi) south of the ancient city of Babylon, and 400 km (248 mi) north of the ancient city of Ur. The city itself was founded in 791 AD, by the Abbasid Caliph Harūn ar-Rashīd, as a shrine to ‘Alī bin Abī Ṭālib.

===Prehistoric and ancient times===


Archaeological discoveries show the existence of a populace dating back to the 1st century BC. Najaf possesses one of the largest burial grounds in the vicinity for Christians. Discoveries in the following centuries point toward the city&#x27;s multicultural and diverse religious history. Mohammed al-Mayali, director of Inspectorate Effects of the province of Najaf, states &quot;the excavation on the graves, which we have been working on for years, confirm that &quot;Najaf&quot; contains the largest Christian cemetery in Iraq, with a cemetery area of 1416 acres. We have found indications of Christianity on the graves through representations of crosses and stones with Christ-like engravings. There are also relics that date back to the Sassanid period. Also discovered in the excavation was proof of a thriving glass industry. Pots were decorated with the cross. as well as Hebrew writings, indicating a community of religious coexistence.&quot;

Wadi-us-Salaam in Najaf was once a holy cemetery for Jews and was then called Baniqia, which could be the first recorded name for the area.
The name Baniqia also was found in some texts which state that Abraham once visited and stayed in this village before continuing his journey from Mesopotamia to Arabia.

In Islam, the city is considered to have started with Ali who instructed that his burial place should remain a secret, as he had many enemies and he feared that his body might be subjected to some indignity. According to legend, the body of Ali was placed on a camel which was driven from Kufah. The camel stopped a few miles west of the city where the body was secretly buried. No tomb was raised and nobody knew of the burial place except for a few trusted people. It is narrated that more than a hundred years later the Abbasid Caliph, Harun al-Rashid, went deer hunting outside Kufah, and the deer sought sanctuary at a place where the hounds would not pursue it. On inquiry as to why the place was a sanctuary, he was told that it was the burial place of ‘Ali. Harūn ar-Rashīd ordered a mausoleum to be built on the spot and in due course the town of Najaf grew around the mausoleum.

===Medieval and modern history===
In early 14th century, Sheikh Ibn Battuta visited the burial site of Ali ibn Abi Talib during his travels in Iraq after his pilgrimage to Mecca. During this period, Najaf was called Meshhed Ali. As Translated by Samuel Lee, Ibn Battuta in his Arabic &quot;Rihla&quot; relates:

In the 16th century, Najaf was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The Safavid dynasty of Iran maintained continuous interest to this Shia site. During the Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–1639), they were twice able to capture the city, but lost it again to the Ottomans in 1638.

Under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, Najaf experienced severe difficulties as the result of repeated raids by Arab desert tribes and the Persian army with acute water shortages causing lack of a reliable water supply. The number of inhabited houses in the city had plummeted from 3,000 to just 30 by the start of the 16th century.

When the Portuguese traveller Pedro Texeira passed through Najaf in 1604, he found the city in ruins, inhabited by little more than 500 people. This was largely the result of a change in the course of the Euphrates river eastwards in the direction of Hilla, leaving Najaf and Kufa high and dry, leading to the destruction of the local formerly rich agriculture, demise of the palm groves and orchards, followed by the salinization of the underground water due to evaporation.

During the 18th century, the scholarly life of Najaf came to be dominated by Farsi-speaking ‘Ulema’ (, Scholars) from Iran.

The water shortages were finally resolved in 1803 when the Euphrates made its way to the city once again. The shift in the river&#x27;s flow was the product of a century-long effort by the Ottomans to shift the flow of the river, so as to deprive marsh-dwelling tribes like the Khaza&#x27;il of the watery environment that allowed them to evade state control. These long-term efforts rendered successful the construction of the Hindiyya Canal in 1793, which further shifted the flow of the Euphrates. These hydrological shifts were to have religious implications. Most notable was the consolidation and spread of Shi&#x27;ism. As the shrine city of Najaf gained access to water again, its notables and holy men began to wield considerable power in the area. In 1811, the last city wall was rebuilt.

=== Modern period ===
The Ottomans were expelled in an uprising in 1915, following which the city fell under the rule of the British Empire. The sheikhs of Najaf including Sayyed Mahdi Al-Awadi rebelled in 1918, killing the British governor of the city, and cutting off grain supplies to the Anazzah, a tribe allied with the British. In retaliation the British besieged the city and cut off its water supply. The rebellion was put down and the rule of the sheikhs was forcibly ended. A great number of the Shi‘i ‘Ulema’ were expelled into Persia, where they set the foundations for the rise of the city of Qom as the center of the Shi‘ite learning and authority, in lieu of Najaf. Najaf lost its religious primacy to Qom, and was not to regain it until the 21st century, during the establishment of a Shī‘ī-majority government in Iraq after 2003.

In the 20th century, much of the Old City was rebuilt in a series of modernization initiatives. Beginning in the 1950s, many historic buildings and monuments, including those adjoining the shrine, were demolished for the construction of Sadeq, Zainulabidin, Rasool and Tousi streets. In 1958, the city wall was torn down and replaced with a ring road. In the 1980s, the entire area between the shrine and the city&#x27;s western edge was demolished, and the residents resettled outside the city, in what locals perceived as a government reprisal for the Shia uprising under the leadership of Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, who was based in the neighborhood.

During the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, Najaf was a key target of the invading United States Armed Forces. The city was encircled during heavy fighting on 26 March 2003 and was captured on 3 April 2003 (Battle of Najaf). The clerical authorities of the Shī‘ī enclave of Sadr City in Baghdad, which claimed autonomy in April 2003, after the fall of Baghdad, claimed to be taking their orders from senior clerics in Najaf.

On 4 April 2004, the Mahdi Army attacked the Spanish-Salvadoran-ALARNG base (Camp Golf, later renamed Camp Baker) in An Najaf, part of a coordinated uprising across central and southern Iraq in an apparent attempt to seize control of the country ahead of the 30 June 2004 handover of power to a new Iraqi government. This uprising led to the American troops arriving in the city in the wake of the Spanish withdrawal. In August 2004, heavy fighting broke out again between U.S. forces and Al-Sadr&#x27;s Mahdi Army. The battle lasted three weeks and ended when senior Iraqi cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani negotiated an end to the fighting.

In 2012, Najaf was named the Cultural Centre of the Arab World. On 6 March 2021, Pope Francis visited the city during his historic papal visit to Iraq and held an interfaith dialogue with al-Sistani, where he expressed a message of peaceful coexistence between Muslims and Christians in the country. During the ISIS war, Najaf Shiites launched solidarity initiative with Sunni areas affected by ISIS. Many Iraqis including religious minorities such as Christians from the north, as well as Lebanese Shia have found safe haven in the city.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Najaf has a hot desert climate, &quot;BWh&quot; in the Köppen climate classification, with long, very hot summers and mild winters. The average annual temperature is . The rainfall averages 69 mm (2.71 in).

==Religious significance==
An-Najaf is considered sacred by Shi&#x27;a Muslims. An-Najaf is renowned as the site of the burial place of Muhammad&#x27;s son-in-law and cousin, ‘Alī ibn Abī Tālib. The city is now a center of pilgrimage throughout the Shi&#x27;ite Islamic world. It is estimated that only Mecca and Medina receive more Muslim pilgrims. As the burial site of one of Shi&#x27;a Islam&#x27;s most important figure, the Imam Ali Mosque is considered by Shiites as the third holiest Islamic site.

The Imam ‘Ali Mosque is housed in a grand structure with a gold gilded dome and many precious objects in the walls. Nearby is the Wadi-us-Salaam cemetery, the largest in the world. It contains the tombs of several prophets and many of the devout from around the world aspire to be buried there, to be raised from the dead with Imām ‘Alī on Judgement Day. Over the centuries, numerous hospices, schools, libraries and convents were built around the shrine to make the city the center of Shīʻa learning and theology.

The An-Najaf seminary, or Hawza Najaf, is one of the most important teaching centres in the Islamic world. Ayatollah Khomeini lectured there from 1965 to 1978. Many of the leading figures of the new Islamic movement that emerged in Iraq, Iran and Lebanon in the 1970s had studied at Najaf. As of 2014, it was estimated to have about 13,000 students.

== Economy ==
The fall of the Ba&#x27;athist regime ended restrictions on Shi&#x27;ite pilgrimage, which led to a pilgrimage boom in Najaf and increased demand for facilities and infrastructure. In 2006, the government sponsored reconstruction of the previously demolished western area of the city as the City of Pilgrims project. Najaf, alongside Karbala, is considered a thriving pilgrimage destination for Shia Muslims and the pilgrimage industry in the city boomed after the end of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s rule. However, due to the U.S. sanctions on Iran, the number of Iranian pilgrims dropped significantly.

Since the end of the 2003–2011 war, numerous projects have been proposed for Najaf. The city has become a model for development in Iraq. Najaf have been experiencing economic boom, along with political events. In 2008, over 50% of about licensed 200 investment projects totaling $8 billion were under construction in Najaf Governorate, with most development coming in the housing and tourism sectors. Najaf has been described as a strategically important city with a stable investment environment and available skilled manpower. The city has experienced an increase in investment. Saudi Arabian firm ACWA Power is in process to construct 1,000 MW solar power plant in Najaf.

The government proposed to build 15 housing complexes in Najaf, with a cost of $7 billion as a part of 240 projects. It also includes development of two industrial parks. In 2024, prime minister Mohammed Shia&#x27; Al Sudani announced several projects in the city, during his visit to Najaf. The projects proposed by Al-Sudani included the Holy shrine&#x27;s carpet-washing factory project will cost 3.46 billion. A cement bag factory covering an area of 75,000 square meters with a production capacity of 240 million bags per year, is being constructed in Najaf. Another project is a glass production factory, which will have a net profit of 32% in the first year of operation because the Najaf desert region has high-quality raw materials for this factory.

<doc id="200514" wikidata="Q236994" url="?curid=200514" title="Adeliza of Louvain">
<text>Adeliza of Louvain (also Adelicia, Adela, Adelais, and Aleidis; c. 1103 – March/April 1151) was Queen of England from 1121 to 1135 as the second wife of King Henry I.

Adeliza was the eldest child of Godfrey I, Count of Louvain, and Ida of Chiny. In 1121, aged about 18, Adeliza was married to Henry, who was around 54 years of age. Henry&#x27;s only legitimate son, William Adelin, had died in 1120, which had prompted Henry to marry again. He hoped to have another son with Adeliza and spent much of his time with her. She seems to have been influential in the promotion of French poetry and other arts at court, but played little part in politics. Though otherwise successful, their marriage produced no children, and Henry decided to leave the throne to his daughter Empress Matilda. Adeliza was among those who swore to support her stepdaughter and did so during her struggle against Henry&#x27;s nephew Stephen of Blois, who took the throne after Henry&#x27;s death in 1135.

As queen dowager, Adeliza spent three years living in a convent. In 1138, she married again to William d&#x27;Aubigny, 1st Earl of Arundel, by whom she had seven children. In 1150, she left her husband to move to the Affligem Abbey in Brabant, where she died the following year.

==Early life and family==
Adeliza was renowned for her beauty, reflected in the epithet &#x27;the fair maiden of Brabant&#x27;. The chronicler Henry of Huntingdon also mentions Adeliza&#x27;s beauty in an interlude in his &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot;, stating, &quot;A jewel grows pale on you, a crown does not shine. Put adornment aside, for nature provides your adornment...&quot;

Adeliza&#x27;s father was Godfrey I, Count of Louvain (1095–1139), Landgrave of Brabant, and Duke of Lower Lotharingia (1106–1128), an ally of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor. After the death of Adeliza&#x27;s mother, Ida of Chiny, Godfrey married Clementia of Burgundy, the mother of Baldwin VII, Count of Flanders, who had fought with the French against the Normans in 1118.
Adeliza&#x27;s illegitimate brother, Joscelin of Louvain, married the heiress to the Percy fortune. He is often referred to as an &quot;opportunist&quot;.

==Queenship==
Plans for Adeliza&#x27;s marriage to Henry I of England may have begun when she was as young as sixteen, even before Henry&#x27;s only legitimate son, William Adelin, died on 25 November 1120 in the &quot;White Ship&quot; disaster. However, Henry&#x27;s need for a new male heir expedited the marriage plans and the couple wed on 24 January 1121. Apparently in addition to her beauty, Henry was also attracted to Adeliza as a wife because she was a descendant of Charlemagne. It is thought that Henry&#x27;s only surviving legitimate child Empress Matilda, from his first wife Matilda of Scotland, may have been involved in arranging his second marriage, due to the fact that she was with him near the time that it was being negotiated. Henry of Huntingdon mentions the royal couple in his &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot;, stating that the new queen accompanied Henry to London at Whitsun (that is, 29 May 1121). Adeliza appears to have travelled extensively with Henry, probably to increase the chances of her conception. Despite their close contact, however, Adeliza and Henry never produced a child.

There is a possibility that Adeliza prayed to St. Romanus to aid her in conceiving a child; St. Romanus, according to legend, was &#x27;born to parents miraculously cured of infertility&#x27;, and in 1124, there was a double viewing of the relics of St. Romanus at Rouen Cathedral. We know about this from the Archives départementales de la Seine-Maritime G 3666 (more simply referred to as the G 3666), and Adeliza was certainly present in Rouen while the relics were present.

Unlike Henry&#x27;s first wife Matilda, Adeliza appears to have played a very passive role in the administration of the kingdom. While Matilda issued some thirty-one charters and writs during her queenship, during Adeliza&#x27;s fifteen-year marriage to Henry I she issued one, and she only attested 13 of Henry&#x27;s many charters, even though they were almost always together.

===Role as artistic patron===

Despite her limited involvement in politics, Adeliza seems to have played an active role as a patron of the arts and literature, and was influential in fostering the rise of French poetry in the English court. While English queens had been traditionally associated with artistic patronage for decades, and a number of them, including Edith of Wessex, Emma of Normandy and Matilda, had financed a number of works in different media, Adeliza primarily sponsored books written in French. At the time, secular books in the French or Anglo-Norman vernacular were extremely popular, a trend given impetus by wealthy aristocratic women like Adeliza. Philippe de Thaon, an Anglo-Norman poet, dedicated his zoological treatise known as the Bestiary to the queen:
&lt;poem&gt;Philippe de Thaon Has distilled into a French treatise
The Bestiary, A book in Latin,
For the honour of a jewel Who is an outstandingly beautiful woman.
And she is courtly and wise, Of good customs and generous:
She is called &#x27;Aaliz&#x27;, Queen is she crowned,
She is the queen of England; May her soul never know trouble!
Listen to what we find About her name in Hebrew:
&quot;Aaliz&quot; is her name; &quot;Praise of God&quot; is
In Hebrew truly &quot;Aaliz&quot;, laus of God.
I do not dare give further praise, Lest envy take me,
But so that she may be remembered And praised forever more
I wish to compose this book; May God be present at its beginning!
&lt;/poem&gt;

The Bestiary would have been amply illustrated, and was intended to be read page by page, not all at once, like a poem. Many other works that Adeliza commissioned were similar in structure to the Bestiary, including the now lost &quot;Life of King Henry&quot; by David.

==Widowhood and remarriage==
When Henry died on 1 December 1135, Adeliza retired temporarily to the Benedictine convent of Wilton Abbey near Salisbury. She was present at the dedication of Henry&#x27;s tomb at Reading Abbey on the first anniversary of his death. At about that time, she founded a leper hospital dedicated to Saint Giles at Fugglestone St Peter, Wiltshire.

In 1138, three years after Henry I&#x27;s death, Adeliza married William d&#x27;Aubigny, 1st Earl of Arundel, one of Henry I&#x27;s advisors, and son of Guillaume d’Aubigny and Maud le Bigod. Together, they lived at her castle of Arundel on the Sussex coast and had seven children. Their names were (by order of birth), Alice, William, Olivia, Reynor, Geoffrey, Henry, and Agatha.

===Relationship with Matilda===
Although not a great deal is known about Adeliza&#x27;s relationship with her stepdaughter, it is known she was present at the ceremony when Henry officially named Matilda as his heir presumptive, since the chronicler John of Worcester states that the Queen &quot;swore [an oath] for the king&#x27;s daughter... and agreed ... that if the king did not have an heir of either sex [...], but ... did not lack a survivor of each sex, then the survivor should inherit the kingdom.&#x27;&quot;
After her second marriage, Adeliza received Matilda at her home in Arundel, along with Matilda&#x27;s half-brother Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester, in defiance of the wishes of her second husband, who was a staunch supporter of King Stephen. She later betrayed them and handed them over when King Stephen besieged the castle.
Trying to explain Adeliza&#x27;s actions, John of Worcester suggests that &quot;she feared the king&#x27;s majesty and worried that she might lose the great estate she held throughout England&quot;. He also mentions Adeliza&#x27;s excuse to King Stephen: &quot;She swore on oath that his enemies had not come to England on her account but that she had simply given them hospitality as persons of high dignity once close to her.&quot; In the end, King Stephen yielded to an appeal from Adeliza and permitted Matilda to depart and join her half-brother Robert at Bristol.

==Landholdings==

Adeliza was given the revenues of Rutland, Shropshire and a large district of London, with possession of the city of Chichester. Henry also gave the manor of Aston to Adeliza &quot;as his queen and wife&quot;. Landholdings that were part of Adeliza of Louvain&#x27;s estate included Waltham Abbey in Essex, and properties in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Middlesex, and Devon. As a gift from Henry I, she was given a property in Ashleworth, a component of the royal estate of Berkeley. In 1126 the whole county of Shropshire was given to her, even though it is not listed in the Pipe Roll.

Adeliza gave her brother Joscelin a large estate in Sussex called Petworth that was dependent on her castle of Arundel; much of the estate is still owned by his descendants, the Egremonts. Henry also gave Adeliza lands that had previously been Matilda&#x27;s including Waltham and Queenhithe. She had estates in Essex, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Middlesex, Gloucestershire, and Devon. Her husband then granted her exemption from tax for those lands. In additions to those gifts, she was given a portion of the royal estate at Berkeley, and the county of Shropshire.

After Henry died, Adeliza continued to exercise jurisdiction over her lands, retaining some of her property until 1150. In 1136, she endowed Reading Abbey with one hundred shillings a year from the revenues of Queenhithe.
On the first anniversary of Henry I&#x27;s death, Adeliza gave the manor of Aston to the Abbey of Reading, and endowed them with lands &quot;to provide for the convent and other religious pweaona [sic] coming to the abbey on the occasion of the anniversary of my lord King Henry.&quot; She added the gift of a church a few years later.

==Later years==
In the last years of her life, Adeliza appears to have faded into obscurity. In 1150, Adeliza left William to enter the monastery of Affligem in Flanders. At least one of her brothers was also living at this monastery. The annals at the monastery are the only source to mention her death in 1151, and her burial site is unknown. Some traditions imply she was buried at the monastery, but a donation made by her brother Joscelin to Reading Abbey seems to suggest she was buried there with Henry I.
Alison Weir disputes that she became a nun in her final years in her book &quot;Queens of the Conquest&quot; stating that Adeliza may have died in childbirth at Affligem and that her heart and viscera were initially buried there while her body was taken back to England.

<text>Colonel Sir Henry Yule (1 May 1820 – 30 December 1889) was a Scottish Orientalist and geographer. He published many travel books, including translations of the work of Marco Polo and &quot;Mirabilia&quot; by the 14th-century Dominican Friar Jordanus. He was also the compiler of a dictionary of Anglo-Indian terms, the &quot;Hobson-Jobson&quot;, with Arthur Coke Burnell.

==Early life==
Henry Yule was born at Inveresk near Edinburgh in Scotland on 1 May 1820. He was the youngest son of Major William Yule (1764–1839) and his wife Elizabeth Paterson (died circa 1827). William Yule had served as an officer in the Bengal army of the East India Company and had retired in 1806. William&#x27;s uncle was the botanist John Yule FRSE.

Elizabeth died before Henry was eight and William moved to Edinburgh with his sons, where Henry attended the Royal High School. In 1833, he was sent to be coached by the Reverend Henry Hamilton at his rectory in the village of Wath near Ripon in North Yorkshire. When Hamilton moved to Cambridge in the following year Yule was transferred to the care of the Reverend James Challis, at Papworth Everard near Cambridge. The other resident pupils were John Neale and Harvey Goodwin. (Neale co-founded the Society of Saint Margaret, an order of women in the Church of England dedicated to nursing the sick, while Goodwin became Bishop of Carlisle.) Yule&#x27;s stay at Papworth Everard ended in 1826 when Challis was appointed Plumian Professor of Astronomy and moved to the Observatory in Cambridge.

After a brief period at University College London, Yule entered the East India Military College at Addiscombe near Croydon (1837–8), followed by the Royal Engineers Establishment at Chatham, Kent. He obtained his commission in December 1838, and joined the Bengal Engineers in 1840.

Both of Henry&#x27;s brothers worked in India. The eldest, George Udny Yule (1813–1886), worked in the Bengal civil service. The other brother, Robert (1817–1857), died near Delhi during the Indian Rebellion. The statistician Udny Yule was the son of George and thus the nephew of Henry.

Henry was interested in Arabic and Persian literature and collected early manuscripts. These were later donated by his sons to the British Museum. He translated the &quot;Apothegms of Ali the son of Abu Talib&quot; (referring to Ali, the successor to Mohammed, the prophet of Islam; the obscure English word &quot;&quot; refers to short pithy sayings, see &quot;hadith&quot;.)

==India==

Yule arrived in Calcutta at the end of 1840. His first posting was in the Khasi Hills, a remote area to the northeast of Bengal in the modern state of Meghalaya. His mission was to establish a practical method of transporting coal to the plains. In this he was unsuccessful but he became fascinated by the region and wrote an account of its people, including the first written description of their living root bridges. In 1842 he was transferred to a team of engineers led by Captain (later General) William Baker charged with the construction of irrigation canals. Their headquarters were at Karnal, to the north of Delhi.

He returned to England in 1843 and married his cousin Anna Maria (died 1875), daughter of Major-General Martin White of the Bengal Infantry (died 1856). In November 1843 she accompanied him back to India but returned owing to ill health. He was appointed to a committee charged with investigating the relationship between irrigation by the proposed Ganges Canal and its impact on public health in the area. He served in both the Sikh wars (1845–1846 and 1848–1849). In 1849 he took three years of extended leave and returned to live in Edinburgh with his wife. He lectured at the Scottish Naval and Military Academy and wrote a volume on fortifications (1851).

A daughter, Amy, was born in 1852 and shortly after her birth, Yule returned to Bengal. He worked in Arakan and Burma and was put in charge of a new railway system. This was interrupted by a posting as a secretary to Colonel Arthur Phayre&#x27;s mission to Ava, Burma, in 1855. In 1858 he published his account of this journey, &quot;Narrative of the Mission to the Court of Ava&quot; with illustrations. The 1857 rebellion made his life difficult, and although Yule was close to the governor generals Lord Dalhousie and Lord Canning, he lost interest in his work.

==Retirement in Europe==
Yule retired in 1862, and Canning&#x27;s death in that year made it difficult for him to find any official appointment in London. In 1863 he was created a Companion of the Order of the Bath through the influence of Sir Roderick Murchison. He devoted his leisure to the medieval history and geography of Central Asia. His wife became unwell, and they crossed Europe to settle in Palermo, Sicily. He made use of the richly stocked public libraries there during this period. He published &quot;Cathay and the Way Thither&quot; (1866), and the &quot;Book of Marco Polo&quot; (1871), for which he received the Founder&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society the following year. After his wife&#x27;s death in 1875, Yule returned to England, where he was appointed to the Council of India. Yule remarried in 1877, his new wife Mary Wilhelmina (died 26 April 1881) the daughter of a Bengal civil servant, Fulwar Skipwith.

Yule was a member, and from 1877 to 1889 President, of the Hakluyt Society. He was also vice-president of the Royal Geographical Society (1887–9), and would have become a president but for a protest that he led along with Henry Hyndman against Henry Morton Stanley. The Society wanted to welcome Stanley but Yule stood against the violent methods used in Africa. One of his heroes, on the other hand, was Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley.

For the Hakluyt Society, Yule edited the &quot;Mirabilia Descripta&quot; (1863), a translation of the travels of the 14th century Friar Jordanus, and &quot;The Diary of William Hedges&quot; (3 vols, 1887–89). The latter contains a biography of Governor Pitt, grandfather of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. He contributed introductions to Nikolay Przhevalsky&#x27;s &quot;Mongolia&quot; (1876) and Captain William Gill&#x27;s &quot;The River of Golden Sand&quot; (1880). He wrote biographical notes for the Royal Engineers&#x27; &quot;Journal&quot;, and many geographical entries in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

Yule&#x27;s most popular work, compiled with Arthur C. Burnell, was the &quot;Hobson-Jobson&quot; (1886), a historical dictionary of Anglo-Indian words and phrases which continues to provide an insight into the language used in British India.

Yule died at his home at 3 Penywern Road, Earls Court, London, on 30 December 1889 aged 69, and is buried at Tunbridge Wells.

==Awards==
Yule was awarded an honorary doctorate (LL.D.) from Edinburgh University in 1884 and served as royal commissioner for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition of 1886. He was created Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India in 1889. In 1889, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (FRSGS).

<text>Baghdad Governorate ( &quot;Muḥāfaẓat Baġdād&quot;), also known as the Baghdad Province, is the capital governorate of Iraq. It includes the capital Baghdad as well as the surrounding metropolitan area. The governorate is one of two small provinces of all 19 in Iraq into which the country divides entirely, yet by a margin of almost three-to-one, the most populous.

== Description ==

Baghdad Governorate is one of the most developed parts of Iraq, with better infrastructure than much of Iraq, though heavily damaged from the US-led invasion in 2003 and continuing violence during the Iraq War. It used to have one of the highest rates for terrorism in the world with suicide bombers, however terrorist attacks have been rare since the territorial defeat of the Islamic State in Iraq in late 2017.

Baghdad has at least 12 bridges spanning the Tigris river - joining the east and west of the city. The governorate&#x27;s northeast includes multiple Mesopotamian Marshes.

The Sadr City district is the most densely populated area in Iraq.

== Province administration ==

Baghdad is governed by the Baghdad Provincial Council. Representatives to the Baghdad Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils of the administrative districts in Baghdad in numbers proportional to the population of the various districts that were represented.

== Government ==
* Governor: Abdul Muttalib Al Alwi
* Provincial Council Chairman (PCC): Riyadh Al Adhadh

== Districts ==
* Adhamiyah
* Karkh
* Karrada
* Kadhimiya
* Mansour
* Sadr City
* Al-Rashid
* Al-Rusafa
* New Baghdad
* Al-Ghazaliya

<doc id="200521" wikidata="Q132695" url="?curid=200521" title="Harry Martinson">
<text>Harry Martinson (6May 190411February 1978) was a Swedish writer, poet and former sailor. In 1949 he was elected into the Swedish Academy. He was awarded a joint Nobel Prize in Literature in 1974 together with fellow Swede Eyvind Johnson &quot;for writings that catch the dewdrop and reflect the cosmos&quot;. The choice was controversial, as both Martinson and Johnson were members of the academy.

He has been called &quot;the great reformer of 20th-century Swedish poetry, the most original of the writers called &#x27;proletarian&#x27;.&quot; One of his most noted works is the poetic cycle &quot;Aniara&quot;, which is a story of the spacecraft &quot;Aniara&quot; that during a journey through space loses its course and subsequently floats on without destination. The book was published in 1956 and became an opera in 1959 composed by Karl-Birger Blomdahl. The cycle has been described as &quot;an epic story of man&#x27;s fragility and folly&quot;.

== Life ==
=== Childhood ===
Martinson was born in Jämshög, Blekinge County in south-eastern Sweden. Born Harry Edmund Olofsson, he was the fifth child of middle class parents who ran a small shop in the village Nyteboda and had four older and two younger sisters. At a young age he lost both his parents, his father died of tuberculosis in 1910 and a year later his mother emigrated to Portland, Oregon leaving behind her children, whereafter Martinson was placed as a foster child (&quot;Kommunalbarn&quot;) in the Swedish countryside. He was moved between different homes and alternated between working for his foster parents and attending elementary school, where he often received excellent grades. Martinson would later depict his childhood in the novel &quot;Flowering Nettle&quot; (1935), and its continuation &quot;Vägen ut&quot; (&quot;The Way Out&quot;, 1936).

=== Years at sea and vagrancy (1920-1927) ===
At the age of sixteen Harry Martinson, as he now called himself, had run away and signed onto a ship in Gothenburg as an able seaman. The steam ship&#x27;s journey reached France, Ireland and Scotland, but after returning to Stockholm Martinson signed off as he could not afford the necessary winter clothes. He then spent eighteen months as a vagrant, eventually reaching as far as Umeå in north-east Sweden and then Tromsø in northern Norway. In June 1921 he was arrested for vagrancy in Lundagård park, Lund. In March 1922 he signed on as a stoker on a steam ship that sailed to Norway and Iceland, but after two months he ran away in Belgium. He stayed in Antwerpen, Belgium for a while before signing on to a ship destined for USA, where he hoped to meet his mother, and then to a Greek ship sailing to South America. He spent some time as a seaman in Brazil and then signed on to a ship that sailed from Rio de Janeiro to Cape Town, and then further to Bombay. In Bombay he again ran away, before signing on to another ship that sailed back to Europe. 

Troubled by lung problems Martinson set ashore in Sweden on his 23rd birthday in May 1927. Martinson would later depict his years as a seaman in several acclaimed books, including &quot;Kap farväl!&quot; (1933), which was a critical and commercial success and the first of his books to be translated to English (&quot;Cape Farewell&quot;, 1934).

=== Literary career ===

Around 1927, Martinson began his literary career and had several poems published in different publications. The same year he met Artur Lundkvist, who introduced him to modernist poets such as Elmer Diktonius, Carl Sandburg and Edgar Lee Masters. In September 1929, Martinson&#x27;s first book of poems called &quot;Spökskepp&quot; (&quot;Ghost Ship&quot;) was published by Albert Bonniers förlag. Together with Lundkvist, Gustav Sandgren, Erik Asklund and Josef Kjellgren he authored the anthology &quot;Fem unga&quot; (Five Youths), which introduced modernism in Swedish literature. His next collection of poems, &quot;Nomad&quot; (1931) featured a wide scope of themes and literary styles, including nature poems, impressions from his sea travels and childhood memories and mixed traditional rhymed verse with modernist free verse and epic prose poems. It was widely acclaimed by contemporary critics and is regarded as Martinson&#x27;s literary breakthrough. It was followed by two prose books in which Martinson recalled his years as a seaman, &quot;Resor utan mål&quot; (&quot;Aimless Journeys&quot;, 1932) and &quot;Kap farväl!&quot; (&quot;Cape Farewell&quot;, 1933) which further established Martinson as one of the leading Swedish authors of his generation.

After a poorly received collection of poems, &quot;Natur&quot; (&quot;Nature&quot;, 1934), Martinson found great success as a novelist with the semi-autobiographical &quot;Nässlorna blomma&quot; (&quot;Flowering Nettle&quot;) in 1935, in which he depicted his childhood. It was a critical and widely read success that at the end of 1935 had been published in three editions, and has since been translated into more than thirty languages. The story was continued in the novel &quot;Vägen ut&quot; (&quot;The Way Out&quot;) in 1936, which was another critical and commercial success. 

The commercial success of his recent books and several scholarships awarded for his writing allowed Martinson to buy a farm in Södermanland, where he lived with his wife, the proletarian novelist Moa Martinson, and her sons. During this time he wrote a trilogy of essay books that focused on nature: &quot;Svärmare och harkrank&quot; (1937), &quot;Midsommardalen&quot; (1938) and &quot;Det enkla och det svåra&quot; (1939).

In late 1939, Martinson was engaged in the Finland Winter War as a representative of the Swedish &quot;Finland Committee&quot;. In winter 1940 he travelled in Sweden and Finland together with five other Swedish authors in a campaign to recruit volunteers to the Finnish army. Martinson himself took part as a volunteer in the war. In March 1940 he spent nine days at the heavily attacked front in Salla as a courier for the Finnish troops. Martinson wrote about his experiences in the book &quot;Verklighet till döds&quot; (&quot;Reality to Death&quot;), which was published in 1941.

&quot;Passad&quot; (1945), influenced by Chinese poetry, was Martinson&#x27;s first collection of poems in eleven years, became a critical and commercial success and his most successful book of poems to date. The novel &quot;Vägen till Klockrike&quot; (&quot;The Road to Klockrike&quot;, 1948) was another huge success, and in 1949 Martinson became the first proletarian writer to be elected a member of the Swedish Academy.

In 1953 Martinson published &quot;Cikada&quot; (&quot;Cicada&quot;), a collection of poems which was another critical success and his best-selling poetry book to date. Much of the collection featured familiar themes in Martinson&#x27;s writing such as nature, didactic poems and criticism of the modern society, but the last section in the book was something new. The cycle &quot;Sången om Doris och Mima&quot; (&quot;The Song About Doris and Mima&quot;), a science fiction like story of a spacecraft evacuating people from the destroyed earth which loses its course and subsequently floats on without destination. Martinson would later expand the cycle to his most famous work, &quot;Aniara&quot;.

&quot;Aniara&quot; was published in October 1956 to unanimous critical acclaim and much public interest. It was later adapted to an opera by Karl-Birger Blomdahl and Erik Lindegren, and the 2018 film &quot;Aniara&quot;.

Martinson worked on a follow-up to &quot;Aniara&quot; called &quot;Doriderna&quot; which was going to be about the people left on earth. In the meantime he published &quot;Gräsen i Thule&quot; (&quot;The Grass in Thule&quot;, 1958), a collection of mainly nature poems that was also well received by contemporary critics and readers. His next book &quot;Vagnen&quot; (&quot;The Wagon&quot;, 1960), a collection of poems which largely was a criticism of the modern society and its technology, was however not well received by contemporary critics. Sensitive to criticism, Martinson declared that no more of his poems would be published during his lifetime, but a few other works where published in the 1960&#x27;s, such as the play &quot;Tre knivar från Wei&quot; (&quot;Three Knives from Wei&quot;, 1964) set in 7th century China, which was staged by Ingmar Bergman in the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm in 1964. In 1971 Martinson returned as a poet with &quot;Dikter om ljus och mörker&quot; (&quot;Poems About Light and Darkness&quot;), which was followed by a collection of nature poems &quot;Tuvor&quot; (&quot;Tufts&quot;) in 1973.

=== Nobel Prize in Literature === 

On 3 October 1974 the Swedish Academy announced that the Nobel Prize in Literature that year should be awarded jointly to Harry Martinson and Eyvind Johnson. Harry Martinson was awarded with the citation &quot;for writings that catch the dewdrop and reflect the cosmos.&quot; The prize decision sparked heavy criticism in the Swedish press against the Swedish Academy for awarding the Nobel Prize to two of its own members. Although there were also positive reactions to the prize decision, the sensitive Martinson took the negative comments aimed at the Academy personally and found it hard the enjoy the recognition.

=== Personal life ===
From 1929 to 1940, he was married to novelist Moa Martinson, prominent as a feminist and proletarian author, whom he met through a Stockholm anarchist newspaper, &quot;Brand&quot;. He travelled to the Soviet Union in 1934. He and Moa were divorced due to her criticism of his lack of political commitment. Harry married Ingrid Lindcrantz (1916–1994) in 1942.

=== Later life and death ===

Throughout the 1960s Martinson suffered from bad health and depressions. He was generally seen as an old-fashioned author by the contemporary cultural world and became less productive as a writer. The sensitive Martinson found it hard to cope with the criticism following his 1974 Nobel Prize award in Literature, and died by suicide on 11February 1978 at the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm after cutting his stomach open with a pair of scissors in what has been described as a &quot;hara-kiri-like manner&quot;. He was buried in Sollentuna on 24 February 1978.

==Literary themes==
Martinson&#x27;s poetry, characterized by linguistic innovation and a frequent use of metaphors, combined an acute eye for, and love of nature, with a deeply felt humanism. His poetry was noted for rich imagery with precise observations that emphazised details. In his later writing nature and the earth became increasingly important motifs. During the 1930s he developed a mastery in describing nature in both prose and poetry and was especially noted for his short nature poems with precise observations. In the autobiographical novels &quot;Nässlorna blomma&quot; (&quot;Flowering Nettle&quot;, 1935) and &quot;Vägen ut&quot; (&quot;The Way Out&quot;, 1936) Martinson tells about his childhood. Martinson had a strong interest in science which was a prominent influence in his work. In his book &quot;Verklighet till döds&quot; (&quot;Reality to Death&quot;, 1940) written during World War II Martinson criticized contemporary social conditions and technological development. Criticism of modern culture is also a theme in Martinson&#x27;s philosophical vagabond novel &quot;Vägen till Klockrike&quot; (1948; English translation &quot;The Road&quot;, 1950) and the collection of poems &quot;Passad&quot; (1945).

In his later writing Martinson developed a new major theme based on his increasing interest in outer space and the cosmic. This came to most distinct expression in &quot;Aniara&quot; (1956), a poetic space epic that became Martinson&#x27;s best known work. In his late work criticism of modern life and its technology came to an even stronger expression in his 1960 poetry collection &quot;Vagnen&quot; (&quot;The Wagon&quot;). 

== Legacy ==
After his death, many hailed Martinson as one of the greatest Swedish author since August Strindberg. The 100th anniversary of Martinson&#x27;s birth was celebrated around Sweden in 2004. The international Cikada Prize is awarded in memory of Harry Martinson since that year. His best known works &quot;Aniara&quot;, &quot;Flowering Nettle&quot; and &quot;Vägen till klockrike&quot; have been translated to over a dozen different languages. The Harry Martinson Society was founded in 1984 and awards the Harry Martinson Prize to individuals or organisations working in the spirit of Harry Martinson. The Swedish Academy awards a scholarship in memory of Harry Martinson to an author writing in Swedish.

<doc id="200525" wikidata="Q2724114" url="?curid=200525" title="Lady Jessica">
<text>Lady Jessica is a fictional character in the &quot;Dune&quot; universe created by Frank Herbert. A main character in the 1963–65 novel &quot;Dune&quot;, Jessica also plays an important role in the later installment &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976). The events surrounding Jessica&#x27;s conception, her birth and her early years with Leto are chronicled in the prequel trilogies &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; (1999–2001) and &quot;Caladan&quot; (2020–2022) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. The character is brought back as a ghola in the Herbert/Anderson sequels which conclude the original series, &quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; (2006) and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007).

Lady Jessica was portrayed by Francesca Annis in the 1984 David Lynch film &quot;Dune&quot;. Saskia Reeves played the role in the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel TV miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot;, which was subsequently portrayed by Alice Krige in the 2003 sequel, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;. Rebecca Ferguson portrayed Jessica in the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film adaptation and its 2024 .

==Description==
Jessica is described in &quot;Dune&quot; as having &quot;hair like shaded bronze ... and green eyes&quot; as well as an &quot;oval face.&quot; This shape is later notable as a marker of Jessica&#x27;s bloodline. Novelist Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert&#x27;s son and biographer, wrote that &quot;Frank Herbert had modeled Lady Jessica Atreides after [his wife] Beverly Herbert, with her dignified, gentle ways of influence, and even her prescient abilities, which my mother actually possessed.&quot;

Francesca Annis, who portrayed Jessica in the 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;, said of the character, &quot;I see her as sort of a supreme matriarch ... She&#x27;s a mother, a guardian, a guide and an almost mystical figure&quot;. Michel Chion wrote, &quot;In the novel, [Jessica] is a pitiless, resolute woman with an influential voice. She is also the book&#x27;s second most important character, present in a great many scenes narrated from her point of view. She does not hesitate to reprimand, advise and toughen her son.&quot;

==The original series==

===&quot;Dune&quot;===
As &quot;Dune&quot; begins, Jessica is the Bene Gesserit concubine to the Duke Leto Atreides, and mother to his young son and heir Paul. Leto has been granted control of the lucrative planetary fief of Arrakis, and is moving his entire household there from his ocean homeworld of Caladan. Jessica&#x27;s mentor and former instructor, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, is still furious over Jessica&#x27;s past insubordination—she had been instructed to bear only daughters but, out of love for Leto, she instead intentionally conceived Paul; Mohiam is somewhat intrigued by the potential she sees in the 15-year-old boy. Still, an Atreides daughter is a crucial part of the Bene Gesserit breeding program to eventually produce a super-being they call the Kwisatz Haderach.

Previously managed by House Atreides&#x27; longtime enemies, the Harkonnens, Arrakis is an inhospitable desert planet plagued by giant sandworms, and the only known source of melange, the valuable drug at the center of the galactic empire&#x27;s economy. Leto suspects treachery on the part of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, but cannot refuse the assignment. Soon the Baron Harkonnen launches an attack, his forces secretly bolstered by Shaddam&#x27;s fierce Sardaukar warriors and aided by Leto&#x27;s own trusted Suk doctor, Wellington Yueh. Coerced by the Baron to save his wife from torture, Yueh disables the shields of the Atreides fortress and delivers a drugged Leto to the Baron, but also provides Leto with a false tooth filled with poison gas. Leto bites down on the tooth in the Baron&#x27;s presence, but the gas only manages to kill Leto and the Baron&#x27;s twisted Mentat, Piter De Vries. Jessica is drugged, bound and gagged to prevent her using her powers. The Baron orders that she and Paul be disposed of in the desert. Thanks to supplies left by Yueh, Paul and Lady Jessica escape into the desert and find refuge with the native Fremen. They take advantage of the legends planted there by the Bene Gesserit&#x27;s Missionaria Protectiva, which practices religious engineering. Jessica casts Paul as the &quot;Lisan al&#x27;Gaib&quot;, the messiah, and herself as the Reverend Mother who shall bring him, even though she has not yet experienced the Bene Gesserit spice agony that transforms an acolyte into a full Reverend Mother. Jessica is also revealed to be the secret daughter of the Baron Harkonnen himself.

Paul soon molds the Fremen into a massive army with which he hopes to retake the planet from Imperial rule. The Fremen have their own &quot;wild&quot; Reverend Mothers, women who undergo their own version of the spice agony to awaken their Other Memory. Jessica undergoes the ritual of spice agony and replaces the dying Fremen Reverend Mother. But Jessica is pregnant during the ordeal, exposing the fetus to the same awakening of ancestral ego-memories. A child born this way is called an Abomination by the Bene Gesserit, because experiencing this heightened awareness before they have formed a personality of their own makes them vulnerable to eventually being overtaken by one of their ancestral personalities. Jessica&#x27;s daughter Alia, a full Reverend Mother from birth, is a grown woman in a child&#x27;s body. Paul&#x27;s Fremen seize control of Arrakis from Shaddam and the Harkonnens, and Paul accedes to the throne as Emperor after taking the Emperor&#x27;s daughter as his wife.

Paul is the Kwisatz Haderach, and eventually sets the Imperium on a course lasting thousands of years in the person of his son, Leto II. Much to the frustration of the Bene Gesserit, they do not control Paul, and the events of the coming millennia leave Jessica noteworthy as a figure of history who committed a great wrong (according to the Bene Gesserit); in the coming centuries, for a Bene Gesserit to choose her love over the instructions of her order is known as &quot;the Jessica crime.&quot;

=== Sequels ===
By the time of &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969), Jessica has returned to Caladan, the ancestral home of the Atreides. She has also, by some accounts, returned to the Sisterhood following the death of her Duke, and while she cannot influence Paul, she does act as distant counselor. It is also implied that she and Atreides Weapons Master Gurney Halleck have become lovers.

In &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976), Jessica returns to Dune to inspect Paul&#x27;s children, Leto II and Ghanima, to see if they can be returned to the control of the Sisterhood. Leto notes the identity of Jessica&#x27;s birth mother: Tanidia Nerus. Realizing that Alia is fully possessed, Jessica survives an assassination attempt by Alia and flees to the desert once more, taking refuge with Fremen leader (and old friend) Stilgar in Sietch Tabr. A civil war has divided Arrakis, with Fremen revolting against the transformation of the desert started by Pardot Kynes. Alia&#x27;s husband, Duncan Idaho, also realizes that Alia is possessed. When Alia instructs Duncan to make her mother disappear, Duncan kidnaps her on the orders of &quot;the Preacher&quot;, a mysterious desert figure that some suspect is Paul Atreides, who disappeared into the desert. Duncan takes her to Salusa Secundus, the home of exiled House Corrino and the previous Emperor Shaddam IV. The Preacher has told Jessica, through Duncan, to train the pupil she finds there: Prince Farad&#x27;n, Shaddam&#x27;s grandson. She trains him in the Bene Gesserit way, and at the end of &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, he becomes Ghanima&#x27;s concubine and Leto&#x27;s Royal Scribe.

Jessica is quoted via epigraph in &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; (1984):
In &quot;&quot; (1986) it is noted that she &quot;lived out her years on Caladan.&quot; According to the &quot;Appendix IV: The Almanak en-Ashraf (Selected Excerpts of the Noble Houses)&quot; in &quot;Dune&quot;, Lady Jessica dies in the year 10,256 A.G. after 102 years of life.

== Prequels ==
In the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy (1999–2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, it is revealed that Mohiam is Jessica&#x27;s biological mother. According to the authors, this fact was pulled directly from Frank Herbert&#x27;s working notes for the original &quot;Dune&quot; series. In the storyline, Mohiam blackmails the homosexual Baron Harkonnen into a sexual encounter. When the first daughter she conceives proves genetically undesirable, she is forced to return. At this point the Baron drugs and viciously rapes Mohiam, and in retribution she secretly infects him with the disease that will later leave him horribly obese. The daughter born of this second union is Jessica. The &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; series also follows Jessica and Leto&#x27;s relationship from their first meeting through the birth (and subsequent kidnapping and return) of their son Paul. It is indicated that Jessica&#x27;s choice to bear a son is partially due to her desire to help Leto overcome the devastating loss of his first son, Victor, by his concubine Kailea Vernius.

The &quot;Caladan&quot; trilogy (2020–2022) by Brian Herbert and Anderson continues the story of Leto and Jessica&#x27;s relationship and Paul&#x27;s early years before the events of &quot;Dune&quot;.

==In adaptations==

===1984 film===

Lady Jessica was portrayed by Francesca Annis in the 1984 David Lynch film &quot;Dune&quot;. Annis said that when her agent first called her to say that Lynch and producer Dino De Laurentiis were interested in her for a part in &quot;Dune&quot;, she declined a meeting because she was working on a television series in northern England and had heard that a &quot;big film star&quot; was already in line for the role. Annis had been recommended to Lynch because of her portrayal of Lillie Langtry in the 1978 series &quot;Lillie&quot;, for which she had won the BAFTA Television Award for Best Actress. Lynch and De Laurentiis persisted, insisting on a meeting and took the Concorde to London. Annis said, &quot;I got the last train to London from Manchester after filming and I met David for an hour at 10 p.m. before getting the all-night train back to Manchester.&quot; During filming in Mexico, Annis burned off her eyebrows, eyelashes and the front of her hair in an oven explosion, which makeup artist Giannetto De Rossi fixed for filming. She said that the Reverend Mothers being bald in the film was an unrelated creative decision by Lynch.

Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; praised &quot;the lustrous Francesca Annis ... who whispers her lines with the urgency of erotic revelation. In those moments when Annis is onscreen, &quot;Dune&quot; finds the emotional center that has eluded it in its parade of rococo decor and austere special effects. She reminds us of what movies can achieve when they have a heart as well as a mind.&quot; Michel Chion described the depiction of Jessica in the film as a &quot;radical reversal&quot; from the novel, writing that &quot;Jessica becomes a gentle woman, a solicitous mother and wife, and finally a docile and discreet companion in flight.&quot; Praising the work of costume designer Bob Ringwood, Ed Naha wrote, &quot;In terms of sheer artistry, Lady Jessica&#x27;s costumes deserve much applause. She wears a variety of shimmering gowns that are never anything less than ornate.&quot;

===2000 miniseries===
Saskia Reeves played the role in the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel TV miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot;. In her review of the 2000 miniseries, Emmet Asher-Perrin of &quot;Tor.com&quot; wrote that Reeves &quot;embodies everything that you would expect from Lady Jessica in both bearing and commanding presence.&quot;

===2003 miniseries===
Reeves&#x27;s real-life pregnancy forced producers to recast the role with Alice Krige for the 2003 sequel miniseries, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;. Laura Fries of &quot;Variety&quot; noted, &quot;it&#x27;s Susan Sarandon [as Farad&#x27;n&#x27;s mother Wensicia] and Alice Krige who steal the thunder as opposing matriarchs of the great royal houses. Although the two never catfight, their ongoing struggle to rule the &quot;Dune&quot; dynasty gives this mini a real kick.&quot; Observing that Sarandon and Krige were &quot;clearly relishing their roles&quot;, Fries added that &quot;Sarandon makes a formidable enemy, while Krige, traditionally cast as the villain, proves she can work both sides of the moral fence.&quot; Asher-Perrin noted of the recast, &quot;While it&#x27;s hard not to miss Reeves&#x27;s elegance, there is an otherworldliness to Krige that suits a Bene Gesserit &#x27;witch&#x27; superbly.&quot;

===2021 and 2024 films===

Rebecca Ferguson portrayed Jessica in the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film &quot;Dune&quot; and its 2024 sequel, &quot;&quot;. The films adapt the 1965 novel in two parts. Ferguson was initially dismissive of the role, as she felt it was too similar to Ilsa Faust, the character she played in the &quot;&quot; franchise, and she did not want to be typecast as a &quot;strong female character&quot;. However, she was convinced after hearing Villeneuve&#x27;s ideas and reading the book, saying she enjoyed the &quot;simplicity of wanting to save something you have created and all of these shades&quot;. 

Villeneuve was intent on increasing the prominence of the female characters and themes from the book. He said, &quot;Femininity is there in the book, but I thought it should be up front. I said , &#x27;We need to make sure that Lady Jessica is not an expensive extra.&#x27; She&#x27;s such a beautiful and complex character.&quot; Ferguson said that while Villeneuve respected Herbert&#x27;s characterization in the book, Villeneuve&#x27;s modifications had helped improve the quality of female characters by expanding the role of Lady Jessica as a soldier and member of the Bene Gesserit. As such, the studio labeled this role a &quot;warrior priestess&quot;, in contrast to the joking label of &quot;space nun&quot; that Villeneuve felt was implied by the book. Ferguson said of Jessica, &quot;She&#x27;s a mother, she&#x27;s a concubine, she&#x27;s a soldier.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Ferguson&#x27;s Jessica &quot;has a fierceness and a fighting prowess, along with her Bene Gesserit mental abilities, not always evident in the novel.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; explained that in the first film, Jessica is simultaneously driven by a need to protect the son she loves and &quot;a desire to facilitate his rise to power&quot;, describing her as &quot;a cunning manipulator who has been training Paul in the superhuman abilities of her order against their wishes, and grooming him for a dark destiny that the young Atreides spends much of the two films hoping to avoid.&quot;

Discussing the second film, Villeneuve said, &quot;Lady Jessica kind of disappears in the second part of the book, and I made sure as I was writing the screenplay to do the opposite, to make sure that she will be active, to bring her back to the front of the story.&quot; Ferguson said of Jessica in &quot;Part Two&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s a mom protecting and training someone, something. I say something because she knows [she&#x27;s dealing with] an entity bigger than themselves. When Paul starts going off, she begins losing power, and it puts her on an unpredicted journey to discover who we are in response to other people.&quot; Villeneuve explained, &quot;She lost everything. She is a survivor like her son Paul, and she has to strategize how to accomplish her ambition. It&#x27;s a really beautiful and nicely complex character.&quot; Jessica becomes fixated with fulfilling the Fremen prophecy and installing Paul as their messiah. &quot;IGN&quot; wrote that Jessica steps &quot;into an even more overtly villainous role&quot; in the second film, with &quot;her relationship with Paul becoming more antagonistic as she sets in motion the events that will lead to his accepting the role of [messiah] and challenging the Emperor&quot;.

While Jessica is depicted in &quot;ornate and ceremonial&quot; costumes as the concubine of Duke Leto in the first film, she wears ritual garments and her face is covered in tattoos in the aftermath of her transformation into the Fremen Reverend Mother in &quot;Part Two&quot;. Villeneuve explained, &quot;She&#x27;s trying to play on the symbolism that was put in the prophecy. She&#x27;s supposed to be the mother of the messiah, so I wanted to bring the idea that she was like the Pope of the Reverend Mothers on Arrakis. There&#x27;s some kind of madness in writing elements of the prophecies on her face. Frankly, I think when you drink the worm poison, it affects your sanity—and the same with Paul. I like the idea that we feel she&#x27;s going too far.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that Jessica is &quot;twisted&quot; by the Fremen ritual and &quot;takes on a chilling ruthlessness&quot;. Villeneuve said, &quot;We see that there&#x27;s a darkness, a very specific darkness in her eyes. Lady Jessica is one of the masterminds of &quot;Dune&quot;. She&#x27;s trying to play her own agenda.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Jessica &quot;goes off the deep end&quot; in pursuing her ambitions for Paul.

&quot;The Telegraph&quot; praised a &quot;tremendous, melodramatically on-target&quot; Ferguson in the first film, describing her chemistry with costar Timothée Chalamet, who portrays Paul, as &quot;devotional, bordering on incestuous&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; praised her &quot;wrenching performance&quot; as Jessica waits for Paul to complete Mohiam&#x27;s test. &quot;IGN&quot; wrote of &quot;Part Two&quot;, &quot;That Jessica has any sympathy from the audience—despite being a eugenicist and megalomaniac who usurped the religious leadership of an indigenous culture so her son could claim dominion of the universe almost purely out of her own vanity—all comes down to Ferguson imbuing her with inner life and dimension that makes us feel like we understand her even when the script doesn&#x27;t actually give us every detail about her motivations.&quot; Villeneuve said, &quot;I&#x27;m looking forward for the world to see what Rebecca has accomplished. She&#x27;s not afraid to go very far away. She&#x27;s a force that I can count on.&quot;

==Merchandising==
A line of &quot;Dune&quot; action figures from toy company LJN was released to lackluster sales in 1984. Styled after David Lynch&#x27;s film, the collection featured figures of various characters. A figure of Lady Jessica previewed in LJN&#x27;s catalog was never produced. In 2020, Funko produced a Lady Jessica figure as part of their POP! Television line. It is a vinyl figure in the Japanese chibi style, depicting Jessica in a glow-in-the-dark yellow outfit styled after the 2021 Villeneuve film. McFarlane Toys released a Lady Jessica 7-inch figurine in November 2020 and Dark Horse released a Lady Jessica 8.9-inch (22.61 cm) figurine in March 2022, both featuring the character in a stillsuit. In February 2024, a Lego &quot;Dune&quot; playset based on the Atreides ornithopter from the 2021 &quot;Dune&quot; film was released, containing a Lady Jessica Lego minifigure.

<doc id="200530" wikidata="Q207847" url="?curid=200530" title="Alexander IV of Macedon">
<text>Alexander IV (Greek: ; 323– 309 BC), sometimes erroneously called Aegus in modern times, was the posthumous son of Alexander the Great (Alexander III of Macedon) by his wife Roxana of Bactria. As his father&#x27;s only surviving legitimate child, Alexander IV inherited the throne of the Macedonian Empire after him, however he was murdered in his early teens, never wielding actual power.

==Birth==
Alexander IV was the son of Alexander the Great (a Macedonian Greek) and Alexander&#x27;s wife Roxana (a Sogdian). He was their second child together and the only one to survive infancy. 

Because Roxana was pregnant when Alexander the Great died on 11 June 323 BC and the sex of the baby was unknown, there was dissension in the Macedonian army regarding the order of succession. While the infantry supported Alexander the Great&#x27;s half-brother Philip III (who had some unknown cognitive disability present throughout his life), the chiliarch Perdiccas, commander of the elite Companion cavalry, persuaded them to wait in the hope that Roxana&#x27;s child would be male. The factions compromised, deciding that Perdiccas would rule the Empire as regent while Philip would reign, but only as a figurehead with no real power. If the child was male, then he would be king. Alexander IV was born in late 323 BC.

==Regents==
After a severe regency, military failure in Egypt, and mutiny in the army, Perdiccas was assassinated by his senior officers in May or June 321 or 320 BC (problems with Diodorus&#x27;s chronology have made the year uncertain), after which Antipater was named as the new regent at the Partition of Triparadisus. He brought with him Roxana and the two kings to Macedon and gave up the pretence of ruling Alexander&#x27;s Empire, leaving former provinces in Egypt and Asia under the control of the satraps. When Antipater died in 319 BC he left Polyperchon, a Macedonian general who had served under Philip II and Alexander the Great, as his successor, passing over his own son, Cassander.

==Civil war==
Cassander allied himself with Ptolemy Soter, Antigonus and Eurydice, the ambitious wife of king Philip Arrhidaeus, and declared war upon the regency. Polyperchon was allied with Eumenes and Olympias.

Although Polyperchon was successful at first, taking control of the Greek cities, his fleet was destroyed by Antigonus in 318 BC. When, after the battle, Cassander assumed full control of Macedon, Polyperchon was forced to flee to Epirus, followed by Roxana and the young Alexander. A few months later, Olympias was able to persuade her relative Aeacides of Epirus to invade Macedon with Polyperchon. When Olympias took the field, Eurydice&#x27;s army refused to fight against the mother of Alexander and defected to Olympias, after which Polyperchon and Aeacides retook Macedon. Philip and Eurydice were captured and executed on December 25, 317 BC, leaving Alexander IV king, and Olympias in effective control, as she was his regent.

Cassander returned in the following year (316 BC), conquering Macedon once again. Olympias was immediately executed, while the king and his mother were taken prisoner and held in the citadel of Amphipolis under the supervision of Glaucias. When the general peace between Cassander, Antigonus, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus put an end to the Third Diadoch War in 311 BC, the peace treaty recognized Alexander IV&#x27;s rights and explicitly stated that when he came of age he would succeed Cassander as ruler.

==Death==
Following the treaty, defenders of the Argead dynasty began to declare that Alexander IV should now exercise full power and that a regent was no longer needed, since he had almost reached the significant age of 14, the age at which a Macedonian noble could become a court page. Cassander&#x27;s response was definitive: to secure his rule, in 309 BC he commanded Glaucias to secretly assassinate the 14-year-old Alexander IV and his mother. The orders were carried out, and they were both poisoned. There is controversy about the exact year of Alexander IV&#x27;s death because of conflicting sources, but the consensus of ancient Macedonian scholars N.G.L. Hammond and F.W. Walbank in &quot;A History of Macedonia Vol. 3&quot; was that Alexander was killed late in the summer of 309 BC, shortly after his alleged half-brother Heracles. However, classical historian Peter Green contends that Heracles was killed after Alexander IV&#x27;s assassination.

One of the royal tombs discovered by the archaeologist Manolis Andronikos in the so-called &quot;Great Tumulus&quot; in Vergina in 1977/8 is believed to belong to Alexander IV.

<text>Kirkuk Governorate (; ; ) or Kirkuk Province is a governorate in northern Iraq. The governorate has an area of . In 2017, the estimated population was 1,259,561 people. The provincial capital is the city of Kirkuk. It is divided into four districts.

The province was named Kirkuk Governorate until 1976, when it was named At-Ta&#x27;mim Governorate, meaning &quot;nationalization&quot;, referring to the national ownership of the regional oil and natural gas reserves. In 2006, the name &quot;Kirkuk Governorate&quot; was restored.

==Governorate government==

*Governor: Rakkan Saeed al-Jabbouri 

==Districts==
==Demographics==
Kirkuk Governorate borders were altered in 1976; when 4 districts were added to the Sulaymaniya, Diyala and Saladin Governorates. The Kirkuk Governorate received the Arab populated Zab District from the Mosul Governorate.

With the Arabization policies of the Ba&#x27;ath party, the number of Arabs in official censuses increased fivefold within 40 years, however the most reliable data indicative of the ethnic breakdown of the governorate are those of the 1957 census. The number of Kurds remained relatively constant from 1957 until 1977, decrease in their numbers coincides with the Arabization process in the 1990s. The Turkmens were seriously affected by the Ba&#x27;ath changing Kirkuk borders their percentage fell from 21% to 7%.

Starting from 1977, 2,000 Christians (Assyrians) were registered as Arabs. From the end of the Gulf War to 1999, about 11,000 Kurdish families were deported from Kirkuk. Since the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, 100,000 Kurds have returned to the city of Kirkuk.

=== Statistics ===
Ethnic data from a League of Nations report from 1925 and British data from 1924, 1930 and 1931 (the province had different borders during these years):


A report by the International Crisis Group points out that figures from 1977 and 1997 censuses &quot;are all considered highly problematic, due to suspicions of regime manipulation&quot; because Iraqi citizens were only allowed to indicate belonging to either the Arab or Kurdish ethnic groups; consequently, this skewed the number of other ethnic minorities, such as Iraq&#x27;s third largest ethnic group – the Turkmen.

==2018 election results==
The following is the results of the 2018 Iraqi parliamentary election in the Kirkuk governorate. Election results are often used to estimate the demographics of the region. However, Iraqi citizens do not necessary vote for parties based on its ethnic affiliation.

==Archeological sites==
Archeological sites in the governorate include Arrapḫa, Nuzi and Lubdu, which all date back several thousand years. Arrapha is located within the modern city of Kirkuk, Nuzi is identified with the site of &quot;Yorghan Tepe&quot; and the location of Lubdu isn&#x27;t certain, but considered to be at &quot;Tall Buldagh&quot;.

<doc id="200535" wikidata="Q229901" url="?curid=200535" title="Isabella of Valois">
<text>Isabella of Valois (9 November 1389 – 13 September 1409) was Queen of England as the wife of Richard II, King of England, between 1396 and 1399, and Duchess of Orléans as the wife of Charles, Duke of Orléans, from 1406 until her death in 1409. She had been born a princess of France as the daughter of King Charles VI and Isabeau of Bavaria.

==Life==

Isabella was born on 9 November 1389 in Paris, France, as the third child and second daughter of Charles VI, King of France, and his wife, Isabeau of Bavaria. Her eldest sibling had already died by the time of her birth, and the second-eldest died the following year; however, she had nine younger siblings, seven of whom survived infancy. Five of her younger siblings were born after Isabella had already been married off to England, and one of them died while she was still there.

In 1396 negotiations started about marrying six-year-old Isabella to the widower Richard II, King of England (1367–1400), who was 22 years her senior, to ensure peace between their countries. Isabella told the English envoys (who described her as pretty) that she was happy to be Queen of England as she had been told that this would make her a great lady. She also started practicing for the role.

Richard travelled to Paris for his bride, where great festivities were held. Afterwards, the court and the English guests went to Calais where the wedding ceremony was performed on 31 October 1396, but would not be consummated at least until the bride&#x27;s twelfth birthday.

===Queen of England===
After the wedding, Isabella went to England and was moved into Windsor Castle in Berkshire. She had her own court, supervised by a governess and chief lady-in-waiting, Madame de Coucy (later replaced by Lady Mortimer). She was made a Lady of Garter in 1396 and was crowned Queen of England in Westminster Abbey in 1397.

In spite of their age difference and the marriage being politically arranged, Isabella and Richard developed a mutually respectful relationship. Due to the age of Isabella (the Canonical law for sexual consummation being twelve), and due to Richard&#x27;s death just three years later, the marriage was never sexually consummated. However, Isabella and Richard enjoyed a good platonic relationship, which has been compared to that between a father and his adopted daughter or between a niece and a doting uncle. He was noted to have treated her not as a wife but rather as the daughter he and his first wife Anne never had. The king regularly visited her in Windsor, where she was tutored by Margaret de Courcy. He treated her with respect, entertained her and her ladies-in-waiting with humorous conversation, and pampered her with gifts and toys. Isabella reportedly enjoyed and looked forward to these visits.

By May 1399 the Queen had been moved to Portchester Castle for protection while Richard went on a military campaign in Ireland. Before he departed, he reportedly visited her, kissed her hand and promised he would let her come to Ireland soon. In June, Isabella&#x27;s uncle, Louis I, Duke of Orléans (1372–1407) took power in France from her mentally troubled father. He decided that a peaceful relationship with England was no longer important or desirable, and let Henry Bolingbroke (1367–1413), Richard&#x27;s cousin and rival, return to England. Henry&#x27;s declared goal was to regain the lands of his father, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster (1340–1399) who had died in February of that year, prompting King Richard to cancel the act by which Henry would have inherited his lands automatically.

Many of England&#x27;s lords supported Henry, who started a military campaign and took the country without much resistance, taking advantage of Richard being in Ireland. Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, Keeper of the Realm and an uncle of both Richard and Henry, eventually also sided with the rebels. He moved Isabella first to Wallingford Castle, then to Leeds Castle. On 19 August, Richard surrendered, and he was imprisoned in London on 1 September. On 13 October 1399, Henry was crowned king. Isabella was confined at Sonning Bishop&#x27;s Palace (residence of the Bishop of Salisbury). After the unsuccessful attempt to murder Henry IV and his sons during the failed Epiphany Rising where the conspirators had gone to Sonning to meet with Isabella, she was moved to Essex and held under heavier guard at Havering Palace.

On or around 14 February 1400, Richard died under mysterious circumstances, possibly of starvation. The French court requested that his widow be returned to France, but Henry IV wanted her to marry his son and heir, Henry of Monmouth (1386–1422). Isabella refused his demands and went into mourning for her late husband. In May 1401 Henry IV promised to return Isabella to France with her jewels and her property. She was finally allowed to return to France on 21 July 1401, but Henry IV kept her dowry, which she was supposed to get back if the marriage was never consummated. The same year, marriage negotiations were started for a match between Prince Henry and Catherine of Pomerania instead.

===Duchess of Orléans===
In 1406, when the marriage negotiations between the Prince of Wales and Catherine of Pomerania had been terminated, Henry IV repeated his suggestion that Isabella should marry his son, but was refused by the French court. In 1420, Henry&#x27;s son married Isabella&#x27;s sister, Catherine of Valois.

On 29 June 1406 Isabella, aged 16, married her paternal cousin, Charles of Orléans (1394–1465), aged 11, who became Duke of Orléans in 1407 following the assassination of his father. Isabella died in childbirth on 13 September 1409 at the age of 19. Her daughter, Joan of Valois (1409–1432) survived and married John II, Duke of Alençon (1409–1476) in 1424.

Isabella was buried in Blois, in the Abbey of Saint Laumer of Blois, where her body was discovered in 1624, wrapped in bands of linen plated with mercury. Her remains were then transferred to the Couvent des Célestins (Convent of the Celestines) in Paris, the second most important burial site for French royalty, which was desecrated during the French Revolution.

<doc id="200536" wikidata="Q923777" url="?curid=200536" title="List of monarchs of East Anglia">
<text>The Kingdom of East Anglia, also known as the Kingdom of the East Angles, was a small independent Anglo-Saxon kingdom that comprised what are now the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk and perhaps the eastern part of The Fens. The kingdom was one of the seven traditional members of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. The East Angles were initially ruled (from the 6th century until 749) by members of the Wuffingas dynasty, named after Wuffa, whose name means &#x27;descendants of the wolf&#x27;. The last king was Guthrum II, who ruled in the 10th century. 
After 749 East Anglia was ruled by kings whose genealogy is not known, or by underkings who were subject to the control of the kings of Mercia. East Anglia briefly recovered its independence after the death of Offa of Mercia in 796, but Mercian hegemony was soon restored by his successor, Coenwulf. Between 826 and 869, following an East Anglian revolt in which the Mercian king, Beornwulf, was killed, the East Angles again regained their independence. In 869 a Danish army defeated and killed the last native East Anglian king, Edmund the Martyr. The kingdom then fell into the hands of the Danes and eventually formed part of the Danelaw. In 918 the East Anglian Danes accepted the overlordship of Edward the Elder of Wessex. East Anglia then became part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of England.

Many of the regnal dates of the East Anglian kings are considered unreliable, often being based upon computations. Some dates have presented particular problems for scholars: for instance, during the three-year-long period of apostasy that followed the murder of Eorpwald, when it is not known whether any king ruled the East Angles. The main source of information about the early history of the kingdom&#x27;s rulers is Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;.

<doc id="200537" wikidata="Q190131" url="?curid=200537" title="Saladin Governorate">
<text>The Saladin, Salah ad Din, or Salah Al-Din Governorate (, ) is one of Iraq&#x27;s 19 governorates, north of Baghdad. It has an area of , with an estimated population of 1,042,200 people in 2003. It is made up of 8 districts, with the capital being Tikrit. Before 1976 the governorate was part of Baghdad Governorate.

The governorate is named after the Kurdish Muslim leader Saladin or Salah ad Din, who hailed from the governorate. This Sunni-dominated governorate is also known as the home of Saddam Hussein, who hailed from the village of Al-Awja. Salah Al-Din governorate, a traditional stronghold of Saddam and his Al-Bu Nasir tribe that is located in the heart of the Sunni Triangle, has been rocked by insurgencies, tribal rivalries, political and sectarian violence ever since U.S.-led Coalition forces invaded Iraq in 2003.

==History==
Saladin Governorate contains a number of important religious and cultural sites. Samarra, the governorate&#x27;s largest city, is home to both the Al-Askari Shrine (an important religious site in Shia Islam where the 10th and 11th Shia Imams are buried), and the Great Mosque of Samarra with its distinctive Malwiya minaret. It also contains an old Zengid mosque.

Samarra was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate in the 9th century CE, and today Abbasid Samarra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

The ancient Neo-Assyrian Empire Assyrian city of Assur is located in Al-Shirqat District on the banks of the Tigris River. Other sites in the governorate include the Crusader Dome (القبة الصلبية) north of Samarra and the Al-`Ashaq Palace (قصر العاشق). Today, the Saladin Governorate has a diverse population of Arabs, Kurds, Turkmens and Assyrians.

In January 2014, there were plans announced by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to make the Tuz Khurmatu district into a new governorate due to its Turkmen majority. However, these plans were not implemented.

=== Autonomy ===
In October 2011, the governorate&#x27;s administration declared itself a semi-autonomous region, explaining that the declaration was in response to the central government&#x27;s &quot;domination over the provincial council authorities&quot;. Saladin, which is a largely Sunni governorate, is also hoping that by declaring themselves an autonomous region within Iraq, it will entail them to a larger portion of government funding. The council cited &quot;article 119 of Iraq&#x27;s constitution&quot; in its call for autonomy, which states that &quot;one or more governorates shall have the right to organize into a region&quot; if one third of the Provincial Council members or one tenth of the voters request to form a region&quot;.

<text>August Böckh or Boeckh (; ; 24 November 1785 – 3 August 1867) was a German classical scholar and antiquarian.

==Life==
He was born in Karlsruhe, and educated at the local gymnasium; in 1803 he left for the University of Halle, where he studied theology. F. A. Wolf was teaching there, and creating an enthusiasm for classical studies; Böckh transferred from theology to philology, and became the best of Wolf&#x27;s scholars.

In 1807, he established himself as &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in the University of Heidelberg and was shortly afterwards appointed professor extraordinarius, becoming professor two years later. 
The common misconception of Böckh&#x27;s forenames being Philipp August originated in Heidelberg where staff of the university misread the abbreviation &#x27;Dr phil&#x27; (doctor philosophiae) as &#x27;Dr Philipp August Böckh&#x27;.

In 1811, he moved to the new University of Berlin, where he had been appointed professor of eloquence and classical literature. He remained there till his death. He was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin in 1814, and for a long time acted as its secretary. Many of the speeches contained in his &quot;Gesammelte kleine Schriften&quot; were delivered in this latter capacity. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1853.

Böckh died in Berlin in 1867, aged 81.

==Works==
Böckh worked out the ideas of Wolf in regard to philology and illustrated them by his practice. Discarding the old idea that philology consisted in a minute acquaintance with words and the exercise of the critical art, he regarded it as the entire knowledge of antiquity (&quot;totius antiquitatis cognitio&quot;), historical and philosophical. He divides philology into five parts: first, an inquiry into public acts, with a knowledge of times and places, into civil institutions, and also into law; second, an inquiry into private affairs; third, an exhibition of the religions and arts of the ancient nations; fourth, a history of all their moral and physical speculations and beliefs, and of their literatures; and fifth, a complete explanation of the language.

Böckh set forth these ideas in a Latin oration delivered in 1822 (&quot;Gesammelte kleine Schriften&quot;, i.). In his speech at the opening of the congress of German philologists in 1850, he defined philology as the historical construction of the entire life – therefore, of all forms of culture and all the productions of a people in its practical and spiritual tendencies. He allows that such a work is too great for any one person; but the very infinity of subjects is the stimulus to the pursuit of truth, and scholars strive because they have not attained. An account of Böckh&#x27;s division of philology will be found in Freund&#x27;s &quot;Wie studiert man Philologie?&quot;

From 1806, till his death Böckh&#x27;s literary activity was unceasing. His principal works include an edition of Pindar, the first volume of which (1811) contains the text of the Epinician odes; a treatise, &quot;De Metris Pindari&quot;, in three books; and &quot;Notae Criticae&quot;: the second (1819) contains the &quot;Scholia&quot;; and part ii. of volume ii. (1821) contains a Latin translation, a commentary, the fragments and indices. It was for a long time the most complete edition of Pindar. But it was especially the treatise on the metres which placed Böckh in the first rank of scholars. This treatise forms an epoch in the treatment of the subject. In it the author threw aside all attempts to determine the Greek metres by mere subjective standards, pointing out at the same time the close connection between the music and the poetry of the Greeks. He investigated minutely the nature of Greek music as far as it can be ascertained, as well as all the details regarding Greek musical instruments; and he explained the statements of the ancient Greek writers on rhythm. In this manner he laid the foundation for a scientific treatment of Greek metres.

His &quot;Die Staatshaushaltung der Athener&quot; (1817; 2nd ed. 1851, with a supplementary volume &quot;Urkunden über das Seewesen des attischen Staats&quot;; 3rd ed. 1886) was translated into English under the title of &quot;The Public Economy of Athens&quot;. In it he investigated a subject of peculiar difficulty with profound learning. He amassed information from the whole range of Greek literature, carefully appraised the value of the information given, and shows throughout every portion of it rare critical ability and insight. A work of a similar kind was his &quot;Metrologische Untersuchungen über Gewichte, Münzfüsse, und Masse des Alterthums&quot; (1838).

In regard to the taxes and revenue of the Athenian state he derived a great deal of his most trustworthy information from inscriptions, many of which are given in his book. When the Berlin Academy of Sciences projected the plan of a &quot;Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum&quot;, Böckh was chosen as the principal editor. This work (1828–1877) is in four volumes, the third and fourth volumes being edited by J. Franz, E. Curtius, A. Kirchhoff and H. Röhl.

Böckh&#x27;s activity was continually digressing into widely different fields. He gained for himself a foremost position amongst the investigators of ancient chronology, and his name occupies a place by the side of those of Ideler and Mommsen. His principal works on this subject were: &quot;Zur Geschichte der Mondcyclen der Hellenen&quot; (1855); &quot;Epigraphisch-chronologische Studien&quot; (1856); &quot;Über die vierjährigen Sonnenkreise der Alten&quot; (1863), and several papers which he published in the &quot;Transactions&quot; of the Berlin Academy. Böckh also occupied himself with philosophy. One of his earliest papers was on the Platonic doctrine of the world, &quot;De Platonica corporis mundani fabrica et de vera Indole, Astronomiae Philolaice&quot; (1810), to which may be added &quot;Manetho und die Hundsternperiode&quot; (1845).

In opposition to Otto Gruppe, he denied that Plato affirmed the diurnal rotation of the earth (&quot;Untersuchungen über das kosmische System des Platon&quot;, 1852), and when in opposition to him Grote published his opinions on the subject (&quot;Plato and the Rotation of the Earth&quot;), Böckh was ready with his reply. Another of his earlier papers, and one frequently referred to, was &quot;Commentatio Academica de simultate quae Platoni cum Xenophonte intercessisse fertur&quot; (1811). Other philosophical writings were &quot;Commentatio in Platonis qui vulgo fertur Minoem&quot; (1806), and &quot;Philolaos des Pythagoreers Lehren nebst den Bruchstücken&quot; (1819), in which he endeavoured to show the genuineness of the fragments.

Besides his edition of Pindar, Böckh published an edition of the &quot;Antigone&quot; of Sophocles (1843) with a poetical translation and essays. An early and important work on the Greek tragedians is his &quot;Graecae Tragoediae Principum ... num ea quae supersunt et genuine omnia sint et forma primitive servata&quot; (1808).

The smaller writings of Böckh began to be collected in his lifetime. Three of the volumes were published before his death, and four after (&quot;Gesammelte kleine Schriften&quot;, 1858–1874). The first two consist of orations delivered in the university or academy of Berlin, or on public occasions. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth contain his contributions to the &quot;Transactions&quot; of the Berlin Academy, and the seventh contains his critiques. Böckh&#x27;s lectures, delivered from 1809-1865, were published by Bratusehek under the title of &quot;Encyklopädie und Methodologie der philologischen Wissenschaften&quot; (1877; 2nd ed. Klussmann, 1886). His philological and scientific theories are set forth in Elze, &quot;Über Philologie als System&quot; (1845), and Reichhardt, &quot;Die Gliederung der Philologie entwickelt&quot; (1846). His correspondence with Karl Otfried Müller appeared at Leipzig in 1883.

<text>In mathematics, a topological space formula_1 is said to be a Baire space if countable unions of closed sets with empty interior also have empty interior.
According to the Baire category theorem, compact Hausdorff spaces and complete metric spaces are examples of Baire spaces.
The Baire category theorem combined with the properties of Baire spaces has numerous applications in topology, geometry, and analysis, in particular functional analysis. For more motivation and applications, see the article Baire category theorem. The current article focuses more on characterizations and basic properties of Baire spaces per se.

Bourbaki introduced the term &quot;Baire space&quot; in honor of René Baire, who investigated the Baire category theorem in the context of Euclidean space formula_2 in his 1899 thesis.

== Definition ==

The definition that follows is based on the notions of meagre (or first category) set (namely, a set that is a countable union of sets whose closure has empty interior) and nonmeagre (or second category) set (namely, a set that is not meagre). See the corresponding article for details.

A topological space formula_1 is called a Baire space if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:

# Every countable intersection of dense open sets is dense.
# Every countable union of closed sets with empty interior has empty interior.
# Every meagre set has empty interior.
# Every nonempty open set is nonmeagre.
# Every comeagre set is dense.
# Whenever a countable union of closed sets has an interior point, at least one of the closed sets has an interior point.

The equivalence between these definitions is based on the associated properties of complementary subsets of formula_1 (that is, of a set formula_5 and of its complement formula_6) as given in the table below.

== Baire category theorem ==
The Baire category theorem gives sufficient conditions for a topological space to be a Baire space.

* (BCT1) Every complete pseudometric space is a Baire space. In particular, every completely metrizable topological space is a Baire space.
* (BCT2) Every locally compact regular space is a Baire space. In particular, every locally compact Hausdorff space is a Baire space.

BCT1 shows that the following are Baire spaces:
* The space formula_7 of real numbers.
* The space of irrational numbers, which is homeomorphic to the Baire space formula_8 of set theory.
* Every Polish space.

BCT2 shows that the following are Baire spaces:
* Every compact Hausdorff space; for example, the Cantor set (or Cantor space).
* Every manifold, even if it is not paracompact (hence not metrizable), like the long line.

One should note however that there are plenty of spaces that are Baire spaces without satisfying the conditions of the Baire category theorem, as shown in the Examples section below.

== Properties ==

* Every nonempty Baire space is nonmeagre. In terms of countable intersections of dense open sets, being a Baire space is equivalent to such intersections being dense, while being a nonmeagre space is equivalent to the weaker condition that such intersections are nonempty.
* Every open subspace of a Baire space is a Baire space.
* Every dense &quot;G&quot;δ set in a Baire space is a Baire space. The result need not hold if the Gδ set is not dense. See the Examples section.
* Every comeagre set in a Baire space is a Baire space.
* A subset of a Baire space is comeagre if and only if it contains a dense Gδ set.
* A closed subspace of a Baire space need not be Baire. See the Examples section.
* If a space contains a dense subspace that is Baire, it is also a Baire space.
* A space that is locally Baire, in the sense that each point has a neighborhood that is a Baire space, is a Baire space.
* Every topological sum of Baire spaces is Baire.
* The product of two Baire spaces is not necessarily Baire.
* An arbitrary product of complete metric spaces is Baire.
* Every locally compact sober space is a Baire space.
* Every finite topological space is a Baire space (because a finite space has only finitely many open sets and the intersection of two open dense sets is an open dense set).
* A topological vector space is a Baire space if and only if it is nonmeagre, which happens if and only if every closed balanced absorbing subset has non-empty interior.

Let formula_9 be a sequence of continuous functions with pointwise limit formula_10 If formula_1 is a Baire space, then the points where formula_12 is not continuous is in formula_1 and the set of points where formula_12 is continuous is dense in formula_15 A special case of this is the uniform boundedness principle.

== Examples ==
* The empty space is a Baire space. It is the only space that is both Baire and meagre.
* The space formula_7 of real numbers with the usual topology is a Baire space.
* The space formula_17 of rational numbers (with the topology induced from formula_7) is not a Baire space, since it is meagre.
* The space of irrational numbers (with the topology induced from formula_7) is a Baire space, since it is comeagre in formula_20
* The space formula_21 (with the topology induced from formula_7) is nonmeagre, but not Baire. There are several ways to see it is not Baire: for example because the subset formula_23 is comeagre but not dense; or because the nonempty subset formula_24 is open and meagre.
* Similarly, the space formula_25 is not Baire. It is nonmeagre since formula_26 is an isolated point.

The following are examples of Baire spaces for which the Baire category theorem does not apply, because these spaces are not locally compact and not completely metrizable:
* The Sorgenfrey line.
* The Sorgenfrey plane.
* The Niemytzki plane.
* The subspace of formula_27 consisting of the open upper half plane together with the rationals on the -axis, namely, formula_28 is a Baire space, because the open upper half plane is dense in formula_1 and completely metrizable, hence Baire. The space formula_1 is not locally compact and not completely metrizable. The set formula_31 is closed in formula_1, but is not a Baire space. Since in a metric space closed sets are &quot;G&quot;δ sets, this also shows that in general Gδ sets in a Baire space need not be Baire.

Algebraic varieties with the Zariski topology are Baire spaces. An example is the affine space formula_33 consisting of the set formula_34 of -tuples of complex numbers, together with the topology whose closed sets are the vanishing sets of polynomials formula_35

<text>Bergstraße (; &quot;Mountain Road&quot;) is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the south of Hesse, Germany. It is at the northern end of the Bergstraße route. Neighboring districts are Groß-Gerau, Darmstadt-Dieburg, Odenwaldkreis, Rhein-Neckar-Kreis, the urban district Mannheim, the Rhein-Pfalz-Kreis, and the urban district of Worms. &quot;Kreis Bergstraße&quot; belongs both to the Rhine Neckar Area and the Rhein-Main Region.

== History ==
The district was created in 1938, when the two former districts Bensheim and Heppenheim were merged.

== Geography ==
The district is located in the Odenwald mountains, with the 517m high Melibokus as the highest elevation. The &quot;Bergstraße&quot; is a tourist route which leads from Darmstadt to Wiesloch; the northern part of this route goes through the district and gave it its name.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms is split into four quarters. In the top-left it shows the Starkenburg castle, which is one of the major landmarks in the district and a reminiscence of the former Province Starkenburg, a former provinces of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, to which the District once belonged. The flower in the top-right stands for the flower-richness in spring. The cross in the bottom-left derives from the coat of arms of the imperial abbey of Lorsch Abbey, and the lion in the bottom-right is the sign of Hesse.

German Formula One driver Sebastian Vettel, who is from Heppenheim, has the Bergstraße coat of arms on the front (chin area) of his racing helmet.

== Politics ==
Bergstraße (electoral district) for the Bundestag.

<text>Independent Television News (ITN) is a UK-based media production and broadcast journalism company. ITN is based in London, with bureaux and offices in Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, New York, Paris, Sydney and Washington, D.C.

ITN produces the daily news programmes for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 in the UK, and in recent years has diversified to produce a wide range of content including documentaries, sports, advertising and digital material for a range of international clients.

Between 1955 and 1999, ITN was more commonly known as the general brand name of ITV&#x27;s news programmes. Since 8 March 1999, ITV has used &quot;ITV News&quot; as the brand name for its news programmes, though ITN continues as the network&#x27;s news provider. The network&#x27;s largest franchise owner, ITV plc (through its Channel 3 franchising subsidiary ITV Broadcasting Limited), is the largest shareholder of ITN, owning 40% of the company&#x27;s shares. Other shareholders are Daily Mail and General Trust, Thomson Reuters and Informa plc, each owning 20% of shares.

==History==
After the Independent Television Authority (ITA) awarded the first six ITV franchises to four companies, it decided that national news should be provided by a separate contractor. ITN was founded in May 1955 by a consortium of the initial four broadcasting companies, with former Labour MP Aidan Crawley as editor-in-chief. The first bulletin was broadcast at 10 pm on 22 September 1955 on ITV&#x27;s launch night. Its original theme tune was &#x27;Non Stop&#x27;, by John Malcolm, which was used for the next 30 years. The bulletin was presented by former champion athlete Christopher Chataway. From the start, ITN broke new ground by introducing in-vision and named &#x27;newscasters&#x27; (rather than the BBC&#x27;s nameless and sound-only &#x27;newsreaders&#x27;), and reporter packages. The unique, probing reporting style of Robin Day caused shock among politicians, finding themselves questioned continually for information – this had never been the case with the BBC. There was also some early tensions with the ITV companies. ABC Weekend TV, the ITV contractor for the north and Midlands on weekends, immediately called for shorter ITN bulletins. While the ITA ruled on a minimum of a 20-minute bulletin, disagreements with the ITV companies over ITN&#x27;s budget triggered the resignation of Crawley after just one year in 1956. He was replaced by Geoffrey Cox.

Throughout the early years, ITN continued to develop its service to the ITV network with an agenda to firstly, fulfil its public service broadcasting requirements and secondly satisfy the ITV companies by attracting viewers. Under this method, ITN continued to differentiate itself from the BBC by conducting probing interviews, introducing more human interest stories and bringing ordinary people on to screen by using so-called &#x27;vox pops&#x27; (interviews, usually held in the street, with members of the general public), all of which were seen as a radical departure at the time in British broadcasting. In 1956 the General Post Office ended its Fourteen Day Rule prohibiting discussion on television of topics for debate in Parliament during the following two weeks. As the ITN reporter and later ITN political editor Julian Haviland, put it: &quot;My view was that at ITN we must be at least as responsible and accurate as the BBC, without being so damned boring&quot;. As ITV expanded, each ITV company that made up the network&#x27;s federal structure had to purchase a stake in ITN and to continue to finance the company.

In 1967, ITN was given the go-ahead by the ITA to provide a full 30-minute daily news programme at 10 pm on ITV. There was further tension with the ITV executives as they were sceptical of the idea that viewers would want a full 30 minutes of news every Monday to Friday and they were also losing valuable peak time slots which could be used for the sale of commercial advertising. &quot;News at Ten&quot; began broadcasting on 3 July 1967 with a newscaster team consisting of Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, George Ffitch and Reginald Bosanquet. It was initially given a 13-week trial run; however, the programme proved to be extremely popular with viewers and continued for a further 32 years. &quot;News at Ten&quot; was to become one of the most prestigious news programmes of its time in British history with a reputation for high-quality journalism and innovation. ITN&#x27;s &quot;News at Ten&quot; also prompted the BBC to gradually expand its 20:50 news bulletin from ten minutes to fifteen, twenty and then twenty-five minutes. &quot;The Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; began broadcasting in 1970 as &quot;News at Ten&#x27;s&quot; rival. ITN also established other programmes in the ITV schedule. &quot;First Report&quot;, a lunchtime bulletin began in 1972 and by 1976, &quot;News at 5.45&quot; commenced. This was a period when ITN enjoyed its greatest plaudits, following Lord Annan&#x27;s 1977 report on the future of broadcasting, which declared: &quot;We subscribe to the generally held view that ITN has the edge over BBC news.&quot;

ITN obtained the contract to produce &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; when the channel started broadcasting in 1982. The programme was launched by Peter Sissons, Trevor McDonald and Sarah Hogg. The hour-long programme has been broadcast at 7 pm since it started and has a reputation for high-quality journalism and thorough analysis. Further expansion came with the launch of overnight television on ITV in 1988, with ITN providing hourly news bulletins, as well as the half-hour &quot;ITN Morning News&quot; to conclude the overnight schedules.

Until the 1990s, the individual ITV companies had an obligation to provide a national news programme, which required them to take a share in the ITN operation. Following the Broadcasting Act 1990, ITN had to apply and bid for a licence to provide such services on these ITV networks, and would have to fight competition in order to preserve its services, as had become the case with other ITV franchisees. The Broadcasting Act also allowed the Independent Television Commission to introduce ownership rules for news providers. The move was to transform the company from a &#x27;cost centre&#x27; to a &#x27;profit-making business&#x27;. The move saw 400 staff made redundant, and the closure of a number of international bureaux to claw back a £10 million deficit in order to provide a competitive product to obtain the ITV news contract. Within three years the company turned to profit in 1993 with suggestions at the time that the company should be listed on the stock exchange.

The company launched &quot;5 News&quot; in 1997 following the foundation of Channel 5.

The 1990s saw major changes to the television landscape in Britain. The growth of multichannel television saw ITV&#x27;s share of audience fall. Against this backdrop ITV itself became increasingly commercially aggressive. This was to be a major turning point in ITN&#x27;s history which saw a reduction in the ITV news contract. By this period the main ITV companies Granada and Carlton had also viewed unfavourably the scheduling of &quot;News at Ten&quot; which became a subject of dispute between ITN and the ITV companies. ITN favoured keeping the bulletin; however, the ITV companies claimed audiences were lost at 10 pm as the news interrupted films and drama programming. &quot;News at Ten&quot; eventually ended in March 1999 with ITN&#x27;s flagship bulletin moved to 6.30 pm with a shorter late night bulletin at 11 pm. Consolidation of the ITV network under a unified ITV brand also saw the removal of the on-screen ITN brand which was replaced with &quot;ITV News&quot;. From this point, the ITN brand was gradually phased out and it is now only referenced to in the end production caption.

In 1997, ITN started producing the Royal Christmas Message every other year.

The early years of the 21st century was to prove to be a challenging period. The axing of &quot;News at Ten&quot; caused public outcry and ITN&#x27;s viewership figures fell by 13.9% Political pressure and pressure from the media resulted in ITV bringing back a shorter 20-minute bulletin at 10 pm three nights a week. The programme eventually lost share to the BBC News at Ten (which launched in 2000 to capitalise on ITV&#x27;s move) and ITV eventually axed the programme again in 2004 and moved the bulletin to 10:30 pm before bringing it back to 10 pm again in 2008. The biggest challenge came in 2001 when British Sky Broadcasting bid to supply network news to ITV as part of a consortium. ITN eventually succeeded and was awarded a contract extension to 2008. In January 2005 Sky News took over supplying bulletins to Channel 5; ITN had produced &quot;5 News&quot; since its launch in 1997 and the contract was returned in February 2012, following a change of ownership at Channel 5.
In August 2000, ITN launched its own 24-hour news channel in the UK, broadcast on satellite, cable and digital terrestrial. It was 50% owned by ITN and 50% owned by NTL. Carlton and Granada gradually bought out the two stakes and renamed the channel the ITV News Channel. It closed down on 23 December 2005. Poor ratings in comparison to BBC News 24 and Sky News, and ITV&#x27;s desire to re-use the channel&#x27;s allocation on Freeview, were cited as the reasons.

In March 2004 following its acquisition of the London News Network, a company previously owned by the now merged Carlton and Granada, ITN began producing local news bulletins for the ITV London region. ITN produced &quot;More4 News&quot; between 2005 and 2009. In 2007 it began producing Setanta Sports News; however it closed in 2009.

Between 1996 and 2002, it also owned a share of London News Radio, which was based at ITN&#x27;s Gray&#x27;s Inn Road headquarters and operated the LBC and News Direct London radio stations. Since 5 October 1992, ITN used to operate a radio news service on behalf of Independent Radio News (IRN) but on 15 October 2008, IRN announced that Sky News Radio was to replace ITN as its main supplier from March 2009.

While news production remains the cornerstone of ITN&#x27;s business model, the company has diversified from its original remit. ITN Source (originally ITN Archive) is one of the world&#x27;s largest sources of historical film. ITN Productions creates multi-platform content for major global brands, covering genres such as factual, entertainment, news and corporate production. Clients that commission programmes from ITN Productions include major UK and international broadcasters such as ITV, the BBC, Channel 4, Channel 5, History and Discovery, with television commissions including &quot;Climbing Great Buildings&quot; on BBC2 and &quot;Mud Men&quot; on the History Channel.

==News and current affairs programmes==
===ITV News===

ITN has produced all national news bulletins on ITV since the network was launched on 22 September 1955. Originally, the ITN logo and brand featured prominently on all news bulletins on ITV; however, since March 1999, bulletins have been branded as &quot;ITV News&quot;. Trademarks of &quot;ITV News&quot; include the use of the clock-face of the Elizabeth Tower of Westminster Palace, the chimes of Big Ben punctuating the day&#x27;s headlines and the signature theme tune; &quot;The Awakening&quot; by Johnny Pearson.

Throughout the early years, ITN established programmes in the ITV schedule including &quot;First Report&quot; at lunchtime, &quot;News at 5.45&quot; in the evening and the flagship &quot;News at Ten&quot;. Today, &quot;ITV News&quot; on weekdays broadcasts the &quot;ITV Lunchtime News&quot; at 1.30pm, the &quot;ITV Evening News&quot; at 6.30pm and &quot;ITV News at Ten&quot; with bulletins broadcast at various times on weekends. ITN has at times interrupted the ITV schedule to provide updates on major breaking stories of national and international importance, including the September 11 attacks, London bombings, 2005 or events involving the British Royal Family. ITN has covered every general election since 1959 for ITV, providing comprehensive coverage of the counts throughout election night and has also broadcast special programmes covering the UK budget speech given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

ITN&#x27;s history is inextricably linked to that of ITV as prior to the Broadcasting Act 1990 each of the ITV companies owned a share. In the 1990s, under new ownership, it was accused of abandoning its previous news style, which was broadsheet in style to mid-market tabloid with news stories that focused on personalities in the news, leading to accusations of dumbing down.

ITN&#x27;s most famous news programme, &quot;News at Ten&quot; was also controversially replaced by an 11 pm news bulletin in 1999, said to be in order to allow ITV to broadcast films without the interruption of a 10 o&#x27;clock news bulletin. &quot;News at Ten&quot; was subsequently re-instated in 2001 after heavy public criticism over the change. The restored programme was 10 minutes shorter than its predecessor and carried less in-depth news coverage. It was also broadcast at a later time at least one day a week, which meant it was often jokingly referred to as &quot;News at When?&quot; There was increasing speculation that the &quot;News at Ten&quot; would again be moved, after under-performing against the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot; on BBC One which broadcasts every night at 10:00 pm. In October 2003, the Independent Television Commission gave ITV approval to move&quot; News at Ten.&quot;

The &quot;ITV News at 10.30&quot; launched on ITV on 2 February 2004 (the day that ITV in England, Wales and Southern Scotland came under the ownership of a single company) and was presented by Sir Trevor McDonald. The programme was longer than its predecessor and carried an integrated regional bulletin, as well as more business stories, a nightly sports update and a preview of the following day&#x27;s newspapers. Mark Austin took over main presenting duties on 3 January 2006.

The rebranded programme again saw new titles, this time featuring people walking over the face of Big Ben and has lately followed a more &quot;sensationalist&quot; approach to its main headlines. When ITV executive chairman Michael Grade joined ITV, he made it clear that he saw news as the key to defining any channel. On 14 January 2008, the &quot;News at Ten&quot; returned, presented by Julie Etchingham and McDonald returned to his duties again. Mark Austin joined Etchingham as co-presenter in 2009. As of October 2015, Tom Bradby has been the main presenter on the programme.

The &quot;ITV Evening News&quot; has, since it was launched in 1999, been the network&#x27;s most popular bulletin. Its main presenter is Mary Nightingale.

In March 2004, ITN took over production of ITV London&#x27;s regional news programmes, which relocated from The London Television Centre on the South Bank to ITN&#x27;s Gray&#x27;s Inn Road base.

On 24 January 2022, ITV announced that the 6:30pm &quot;ITV Evening News&quot; will be extended to an hour from March 2022, making it the third hour long news programme ITN will be producing for the national PSB channels in 2022, along with &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; and &quot;5 News at 5&quot;.

===Channel 4 News===
ITN is home to Channel 4 News, having produced the programme since the channel&#x27;s inception in 1982.

The Channel 4 News flagship programme is 55 minutes of in-depth news and current affairs broadcast at 7 pm each weekday and at 6:30 pm on Saturdays and Sundays. The weekday evening programme was anchored by journalist Jon Snow for 32 years until 23 December 2021, with the programme now being presented by a range of newscasters, including &quot;Unreported World&quot; presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy.

A five-minute-long news summary goes out Monday to Friday at midday. The bulletin replaced Channel 4&#x27;s 30-minute &quot;News at Noon&quot; programme in late 2009, six years after its launch during the Iraq War of 2003.

ITN created &quot;More4 News&quot; when the digital channel More4 was launched in October 2005. It ran at 8 pm, immediately after Channel 4 News. It was originally presented by Sarah Smith; Kylie Morris took over presenting duties in June 2007 and Smith was posted to the US as Channel 4 News&#x27; Washington correspondent. In December 2009 Channel 4 cancelled &quot;More4 News&quot;.

===5 News===
From the launch of Channel 5 in 1997, ITN provided the news bulletins for 5 News. However, in January 2005, ITN lost the contract, which was awarded to Sky News. In 2011 ITN regained the contract in a three-year deal to provide news for Channel 5 from early 2012, but on a much-reduced budget. The deal followed an agreement by Sky and Northern &amp; Shell, the then-owner of Channel 5, to terminate the 5 News contract early.

In addition to a number of short bulletins, ITN provided two main half-hour evening news programmes for Channel 5 until 2021. In September 2021, Ofcom approved the removal of the 6.30pm news slot by Channel 5 in order for the ViacomCBS channel to schedule &quot;Neighbours&quot; at 6pm and &quot;Eggheads&quot; at 6.30pm with a new hour long &quot;5 News&quot; programme going out on the channel at 5pm. Ofcom&#x27;s approval of the channel&#x27;s new conditions recognised that there will be still three-hours of news between 5-8pm over all the main public service broadcasters’ channels, and that Channel 5 was still committed to delivering more than 280 hours of news each year. The relaunched hour long &quot;5 News at 5&quot; was first broadcast by the channel on 8 November 2021, with the programme presented by Sian Williams and Claudia-Liza Vanderpuije. In addition to the channel&#x27;s news, ITN was given an extra hour slot by Channel 5 in January 2022 to extend their daily current affairs phone-in and discussion show &quot;Jeremy Vine&quot; each weekday morning.

===&quot;The Wright Stuff/Jeremy Vine&quot;===
In 2018, ITN secured the contract for Channel 5&#x27;s topical morning debate and chat show &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;, just before the host of 18 years, Matthew Wright, announced he was going to leave the programme. Wright was replaced by BBC Radio 2 presenter Jeremy Vine, who had been hosting a lunchtime phone-in debate show on the radio since 2003, with the programme becoming eponymously named when Vine took over in September 2018. In 2022, the programme was extended by Channel 5, with the extra hour being known as &quot;Jeremy Vine Extra&quot; as it is presented by Storm Huntley rather than Vine, who starts his radio show at noon.

==Other programmes of note==
=== Channel 5 Royal Documentaries ===
ITN&#x27;s royal documentaries have been a ratings winner for Channel 5 on Saturday nights, with programmes released about the current monarchy under names such as &quot;Harry and Meghan: Two Troubled Years&quot;, &quot;Charles and Camilla: King and Queen in Waiting&quot; and &quot;Fergie &amp; Andrew The Duke &amp; Duchess of Disaster&quot;. Documentaries about the past members of the British Royal Family are also getting good viewing figures, with a programme about King George V (whose reign was from 6 May 1910 until 20 January 1936) achieving a rating of 1.4 million viewers when it was first broadcast. Most of these documentaries feature archive clips with contributions from historians and royal watchers like former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond or Lady Colin Campbell. As well as the British Royal Family, the slot had also been used to schedule an ITN documentary called &quot;The Grace of Monaco: Hollywood Princess&quot; about Grace Kelly, the American actor who married Prince Rainier III of Monaco in April 1956, one of the few ITN royal titles featuring foreign-born royalty.

===Other Royal Documentaries ===
ITN also made the documentary &quot;Charles: Our New King&quot; for Beyond Rights, with the programme scheduled for a transmission slot on Channel 4, The Smithsonian Channel (in North America), SBS and M6. Similar to ITN&#x27;s programmes for Channel 5, the programme was a trawl through its Royal archive with experts like Ayesha Hazarika, Bonnie Greer, Polly Toynbee and Ian Skelly analysing various points in King Charles&#x27; life.

==Operations==
===ITN Productions===

ITN Productions was formed in February 2010 and incorporates the non-news operations of ITN, including the former ITN On, ITN Factual and ITN Corporate divisions.

Showbiz bulletins from ITN are broadcast daily on a number of television channels, including &quot;FYI Daily&quot; on ITV2, ITV3 and ITV4, and &quot;Entertainment News on 5&quot; (formally called &quot;Access&quot;) for Channel 5&#x27;s range of channels. A daily showbiz breakfast show, &quot;The Breakfast Fix&quot; was broadcast on 4Music along with showbiz updates under the name of &quot;The Fix&quot;.

From August 2013, ITN Productions was awarded the contract to produce the Premier League online and mobile highlights service for News UK. Content appears on &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; subscription websites and mobile apps.

ITN Productions also creates factual programming for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 as well as international broadcasters, including Discovery Channel, History, PBS and National Geographic.

ITN has produced shows for Sky, with one of its later programmes being &quot;&quot;.

ITN also supplied programming to the now-closed Teachers TV service.

===Former operations===

ITN began its own &quot;World News&quot; bulletins in the late 1980s, which were shown around the world on local television channels, particularly on PBS stations in the US, where presenter Daljit Dhaliwal (now with Al-Jazeera English) enjoyed cult status. These were discontinued in 2001, in the face of competition from dedicated news channels such as BBC World (now known as BBC World News), although it still provides footage to CNN International and reports often appear on &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;. Its &quot;ITV Evening News&quot; bulletin was shown on the Newsworld International cable channel in the US.

From December 1997 to April 2003, ITN held a 49% stake in European news channel Euronews.

ITN launched a 24-hour news channel on 1 August 2000, which in 2002 was sold to the main ITV companies Carlton and Granada, and rebranded as the ITV News Channel. It was closed down in 2005.

On the same day, ITN launched a 24-hour radio station called ITN News Radio. It broadcast nationally on the Digital One multiplex until 2003.

In 2005, ITN became a shareholder in Espresso Group, a provider of digital content to more than 60% of primary schools in the UK and also internationally. Espresso services feature an extensive library of broadband teaching resources and student activities to motivate pupils and support teachers, including content from ITN Source. In May 2008, the Education Clip Library, a unique, video licensing service for educational publishers and broadcasters around the world, was launched. It is aimed at educational publishers and broadcasters seeking to add video to their instructional products and services. Espresso was acquired by Discovery Education (part of Discovery Communications) on 7 November 2013.

Setanta Sports News was a 24-hour sports news television channel produced by ITN and jointly owned by Virgin Media Television and Setanta Sports, launched on 29 November 2007. The channel ceased broadcasting on 23 June 2009, when Setanta&#x27;s UK operation were placed into administration following financial difficulties.

In October 2008, ITN founded digital production company Diagonal View as a joint venture together with digital entrepreneur Matt Heiman. The company packages footage from the ITN archive and syndicates it to a range of commercial partners including Myspace, YouTube and MSN. In March 2017, the company was sold to Sky, who paid £2.6m for ITN&#x27;s stake.

ITN Consulting was the management consultancy arm of ITN, combining the resources of ITN with the consulting team&#x27;s experience to advise global media companies on issues spanning all areas of strategy and operations, including financial planning, marketing, scheduling and content, recruitment, and interim management. With partner Venture Consulting, it had offices in London, Milan, Dubai, Singapore and Sydney. It operated as a network with its consultants working on engagements globally and focused &quot;on how strategy can be implemented to deliver to real change&quot;. ITN Consulting stated that &quot;an understanding of how global, regional and local media markets conflict and come together enables them to identify the opportunities this creates&quot;. They took an external, outsider perspective as well as having the viewpoint of senior &quot;insider&quot; media executives. ITN Consulting was extensively involved in the development of business plans for local TV in the UK. It also consulted a range of national broadcasters on improving performance. The unit closed in 2012.

ITN Source (formerly ITN Archive) licensed video footage from ITN&#x27;s one million hours of archive content including news, drama, celebrity, comedy, music, wildlife, natural history and film. It also syndicated on-the-day news footage generated by ITN to other broadcasters and producers worldwide. The service represented the moving image libraries of Reuters, ITV (including ITV Studios), ANI, UTV Media, Fox News, Fox Movietone, Gaumont-British, Nine Network and other specialist collections. The division was closed at the end of 2016, when ITN outsourced its archive sales to Getty Images.

== Corporate affairs ==

=== Headquarters and studios ===
ITN has been based at 200 Gray&#x27;s Inn Road since 1991. The purpose-built headquarters were designed by architect Sir Norman Foster, and officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 8 May 1991. The building also houses the ITV Network Centre and Warner Bros. offices. Prior to the redevelopment, the site was the location of &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; offices from 1974 to 1986, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; offices from 1961 to 1976.

ITN&#x27;s first base was Ingersoll House on Kingsway, before moving across the road to Associated-Rediffusion&#x27;s newly converted Television House shortly before the first broadcast.

In August 1969, the company moved to ITN House at 48 Wells Street, close to the BBC&#x27;s Broadcasting House.

As of December 2020, there are three operational television studios based at ITN. Studios 1 and 2 are located in the basement of the building, with both studios measuring 2,438 sq ft in size each. Studio 1 is currently used by the ITV national news bulletins and the ITV News London bulletins, and comprises a full green screen backdrop in the studio, with two desk areas facing each other. Studio 2 is used by Channel 5 News and also produces Jeremy Vine&#x27;s morning show on Channel 5. Studio 6 is located adjacent to the atrium of ITN and has been home to Channel 4 News since 1999.

=== Leadership ===
The Chief Executive of ITN is Rachel Corp. A former ITV News Editor, Rachel succeeded Deborah Turness in September 2022, when Turness left to join the BBC. Prior to Turness, ITN was led by Anna Mallett, who left to join Netflix. Mallett had been in post for around two years, having joined the company in April 2019.

The Times reported in 2022, that one former ITN staff member signed a secrecy clause or NDA after accepting a financial settlement and agreeing to drop allegations of victimisation and sex discrimination inside the company.

The woman said she raised her grievance in 2020 after ITN’s then chief executive, Anna Mallett, told staff she wanted to create &quot;a culture where people feel confident to speak up&quot;.

In 2023, ITN appointed Ian Rumsey as Managing Director of Content and Tami Hoffman as Director of News Distribution and Commercial Innovation. 

===Ownership===
The current shareholders of ITN are:

* ITV plc (40%)
* Daily Mail and General Trust (20%)
* Thomson Reuters (20%)
* Informa (20%)

Upon its inception, ITN was jointly owned by all the ITV operating companies, with shareholdings split roughly in proportion to each company&#x27;s advertising income. However, the Broadcasting Act 1990 allowed the ITC to set ownership rules. It was decided to limit the ITV companies to a maximum joint 49% stake, with no single company allowed more than a 20% holding. The powers were abolished by the Communications Act 2003.

==Parodies==

ITN has been spoofed several times on ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;, namely in one 1971 show with the logo reading &quot;NIT&quot; instead of &quot;ITN&quot; and with Hill as Reginald &quot;Boozenquet&quot; and Andrew Gardner.

ITN was also spoofed in a sketch in 1978 with Benny Hill as Angela O&#x27;Rippon, a parody of Angela Rippon, and as Ann Afford, a parody of Anna Ford. It was also spoofed in a black and white 1971 show and a 1973 episode.

<text>Nowruz ( ) (lit: &quot;New Day&quot;) is the Iranian New Year or Persian New Year. Historically, it has been observed by Persians and other Iranian peoples, but is now celebrated by many ethnicities worldwide. It is a festival based on the Northern Hemisphere spring equinox, which marks the first day of a new year on the Solar Hijri calendar; it usually coincides with a date between 19 March and 22 March on the Gregorian calendar.

The roots of Nowruz lie in Zoroastrianism, and it has been celebrated by many peoples across West Asia, Central Asia, the Caucasus and the Black Sea Basin, the Balkans, and South Asia for over 3,000 years. In the modern era, while it is observed as a secular holiday by most celebrants, Nowruz remains a holy day for Zoroastrians, Baháʼís, and Ismaʿili Shia Muslims.

For the Northern Hemisphere, Nowruz marks the beginning of spring. Customs for the festival include various fire and water rituals, celebratory dances, gift exchanges, and poetry recitations, among others; these observances differ between the cultures of the diverse communities that celebrate it.

== Overview ==
The first day of the Iranian calendar falls on the March equinox, the first day of spring, around 21 March. In the 11th century AD the Iranian calendar was reformed by Omar Khayyam in order to fix the beginning of the calendar year, i.e. Nowruz, at the vernal equinox. Accordingly, the definition of Nowruz given by the Iranian astronomer Tusi was the following: &quot;the first day of the official New Year [Nowruz] was always the day on which the sun entered Aries before noon.&quot; Nowruz is the first day of Farvardin, the first month of the Iranian solar calendar, which is the official calendar in use in Iran, and formerly in Afghanistan.

The United Nations officially recognized the &quot;International Day of Nowruz&quot; with the adoption of Resolution 64/253 by the United Nations General Assembly in February 2010.

=== Etymology ===
The word is a combination of the Persian words (, meaning &#x27;new&#x27;) and (, &#x27;day&#x27;). Pronunciation varies among Persian dialects, with Eastern dialects using the pronunciation (as in Dari and Classical Persian, however in Tajik, it is , written ), western dialects , and Tehranis . A variety of spelling variations for the word &quot;nowruz&quot; exist in English-language usage, including &quot;norooz&quot;, &quot;novruz&quot;, &quot;nowruz&quot;, &quot;navruz&quot;, &quot;nauruz&quot; and &quot;newroz&quot;.

=== Spring equinox calculation ===


Nowruz&#x27;s timing is based on the vernal equinox. In Iran, it is the day of the new year in the Solar Hijri algorithmic calendar, which is based on precise astronomical observations, and moreover use of sophisticated intercalation system, which makes it more accurate than its European counterpart, the Gregorian calendar.

Each 2820-year great grand cycle contains 2,137 normal years of 365 days and 683 leap years of 366 days, with the average year length over the great grand cycle 365.24219852. This average is just 0.00000026 (2.6×10−7) of a dayslightly more than 1/50 of a secondshorter than Newcomb&#x27;s value for the mean tropical year of 365.24219878 days, but differs considerably more from the current average vernal equinox year of 365.242362 days, which means that the new year, intended to fall on the vernal equinox, would drift by half a day over the course of a cycle. As the source explains, the 2820-year cycle is erroneous and has never been used in practice.
=== &quot;Chaharshanbe Suri&quot; ===

Chaharshanbe Suri ( (lit. &quot;Festive Wednesday&quot;) is a prelude to the New Year. In Iran, it is celebrated on the eve of the last Wednesday before Nowruz. It is usually celebrated in the evening by performing rituals such as jumping over bonfires and lighting off firecrackers and fireworks.

In Azerbaijan, where the preparation for Novruz usually begins a month earlier, the festival is held every Tuesday during four weeks before the holiday of Novruz. Each Tuesday, people celebrate the day of one of the four elementswater, fire, earth and wind. On the holiday eve, the graves of relatives are visited and tended.

Iranians sing the poetic line &quot;my yellow is yours, your red is mine&quot;, which means &quot;my weakness to you and your strength to me&quot; () to the fire during the festival, asking the fire to take away ill-health and problems and replace them with warmth, health, and energy. Trail mix and berries are also served during the celebration.

Spoon banging (, ) is a tradition observed on the eve of Charshanbe Suri, similar to the Halloween custom of trick-or-treating. In Iran, people wear disguises and go door-to-door banging spoons against plates or bowls and receive packaged snacks. In Azerbaijan, children slip around to their neighbors&#x27; homes and apartments on the last Tuesday prior to Novruz, knock at the doors, and leave their caps or little basket on the thresholds, hiding nearby to wait for candies, pastries and nuts.

The ritual of jumping over fire has continued in Armenia in the feast of Trndez, which is a feast of purification in the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Armenian Catholic Church, celebrated forty days after Jesus&#x27;s birth.

=== &quot;Sizdah Be-dar&quot; ===
In Iran, the Nowruz holidays last thirteen days. On the thirteenth day of the New Year, Iranians leave their houses to enjoy nature and picnic outdoors, as part of the Sizdah Bedar ceremony. The greenery grown for the Haft-sin setting is thrown away, usually into running water. It is also customary for young single people, especially young girls, to tie the leaves of the greenery before discarding it, expressing a wish to find a partner. Another custom associated with Sizdah Bedar is the playing of jokes and pranks, similar to April Fools&#x27; Day.

== History ==
=== Origin in the Iranian religions ===

There exist various foundation myths for Nowruz in Iranian mythology.

The Shahnameh credits the foundation of Nowruz to the mythical Iranian King Jamshid, who saves mankind from a winter destined to kill every living creature. To defeat the killer winter, Jamshid constructed a throne studded with gems. He had demons raise him above the earth into the heavens; there he sat, shining like the Sun. The world&#x27;s creatures gathered and scattered jewels around him and proclaimed that this was the &quot;New Day&quot; (&quot;Now Ruz&quot;). This was the first day of Farvardin, which is the first month of the Iranian calendar.

Although it is not clear whether Proto-Indo-Iranians celebrated a feast as the first day of the calendar, there are indications that Iranians may have observed the beginning of both autumn and spring, respectively related to the harvest and the sowing of seeds, for the celebration of the New Year. Mary Boyce and Frantz Grenet explain the traditions for seasonal festivals and comment: &quot;It is possible that the splendor of the Babylonian festivities at this season, led the Iranians to develop their own spring festival into an established New Year feast, with the name &quot;Navasarda&quot; &quot;New Year&quot; (a name which, though first attested through Middle Persian derivatives, is attributed to the Achaemenian period).&quot; Akitu was the Babylonian festivity held during the spring month of Nisan in which Nowruz falls. Since the communal observations of the ancient Iranians appear in general to have been seasonal ones and related to agriculture, &quot;it is probable that they traditionally held festivals in both autumn and spring, to mark the major turning points of the natural year.&quot;

Nowruz is partly rooted in the tradition of Iranian religions, such as Mithraism and Zoroastrianism. In Mithraism, festivals had a deep linkage with the Sun&#x27;s light. The Iranian festivals such as Mehregan (autumnal equinox), Tirgan, and the eve of Chelle ye Zemestan (winter solstice) also had an origin in the Sun god (Mithra). Among other ideas, Zoroastrianism is the first monotheistic religion that emphasizes broad concepts such as the corresponding work of good and evil in the world, and the connection of humans to nature. Zoroastrian practices were dominant for much of the history of ancient Iran. In Zoroastrianism, the seven most important Zoroastrian festivals are the six Gahambar festivals and Nowruz, which occurs at the spring equinox. According to Mary Boyce, &quot;It seems a reasonable surmise that Nowruz, the holiest of them all, with deep doctrinal significance, was founded by Zoroaster himself&quot;; although there is no clear date of origin. Between sunset on the day of the sixth Gahambar and sunrise of Nowruz, Hamaspathmaedaya (later known, in its extended form, as &quot;Frawardinegan&quot;; and today is known as &quot;Farvardigan&quot;) was celebrated. This and the Gahambars are the only festivals named in the surviving text of the Avesta.

The 10th-century scholar Biruni, in his work &quot;Kitab al-Tafhim li Awa&#x27;il Sina&#x27;at al-Tanjim&quot;, provides a description of the calendars of various nations. Besides the Iranian calendar, various festivals of Greeks, Jews, Arabs, Sabians, and other nations are mentioned in the book. In the section on the Iranian calendar, he mentions Nowruz, Sadeh, Tirgan, Mehrgan, the six Gahambars, Farvardigan, Bahmanja, Esfand Armaz and several other festivals. According to him, &quot;It is the belief of the Iranians that Nowruz marks the first day when the universe started its motion.&quot; The Persian historian Gardizi, in his work titled &quot;Zayn al-Akhbār&quot;, under the section of the Zoroastrians festivals, mentions Nowruz (among other festivals) and specifically points out that Zoroaster highly emphasized the celebration of Nowruz and Mehrgan.

=== Achaemenid period ===
Although the word &quot;Nowruz&quot; is not recorded in Achaemenid inscriptions, there is a detailed account by Xenophon of a Nowruz celebration taking place in Persepolis and the continuity of this festival in the Achaemenid tradition. Nowruz was an important day during the Achaemenid Empire (). Kings of the different Achaemenid nations would bring gifts to the King of Kings. The significance of the ceremony was such that King Cambyses II&#x27;s appointment as the king of Babylon was legitimized only after his participation in the referred annual Achaemenid festival.

==== Celebrations at Persepolis ====
It has been suggested that the famous Persepolis complex, or at least the palace of Apadana and the Hundred Columns Hall, were built for the specific purpose of celebrating a feast related to Nowruz.

==== Iranian and Jewish calendars ====
In 539 BC, the Jews came under Iranian rule, thus exposing both groups to each other&#x27;s customs. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the story of Purim as told in the Book of Esther is adapted from an Iranian novella about the shrewdness of harem queens, suggesting that Purim may be an adoption of Iranian New Year. A specific novella is not identified and Encyclopedia Britannica itself notes that &quot;no Jewish texts of this genre from the Persian period are extant, so these new elements can be recognized only inferentially.&quot; Purim is celebrated the 14 of Adar, usually within a month before Nowruz (as the date of Purim is set according to the Jewish calendar, which is lunisolar), while Nowruz occurs at the spring equinox. It is possible that the Jews and Iranians of the time may have shared or adopted similar customs for these holidays. The Lunar new year of the Middle East occurs on 1 Nisan, the new moon of the first month of spring, which usually falls within a few weeks of Nowruz.

==== Legacy in Persian literature ====
In his Shahnameh, the tenth-century poet Ferdowsi narrates a fictional account of Darius III&#x27;s death, where an injured Darius, with his head cradled on Alexander the Great’s thigh, asks Alexander to wed Roxana, so their children might uphold Nowruz and keep the flame of Zoroaster burning:
=== Parthian and Sasanian periods ===
Nowruz was the holiday of Parthian dynastic empires who ruled Iran (248 BC–224 AD) and the other areas ruled by the Arsacid dynasties outside of Parthia (such as the Arsacid dynasties of Armenia and Iberia). There are specific references to the celebration of Nowruz during the reign of Vologases I (51–78 AD), but these include no details. Before Sassanians established their power in Western Asia around 300 AD, Parthians celebrated Nowruz in autumn, and the first of Farvardin began at the autumn equinox. During the reign of the Parthian dynasty, the spring festival was Mehregan, a Zoroastrian and Iranian festival celebrated in honor of Mithra.

Extensive records on the celebration of Nowruz appear following the accession of Ardashir I, the founder of the Sasanian Empire (224–651 AD). Under the Sassanid emperors, Nowruz was celebrated as the most important day of the year. Most royal traditions of Nowruz, such as royal audiences with the public, cash gifts, and the pardoning of prisoners, were established during the Sassanid era and persisted unchanged until modern times.

=== Arab conquest and Islamization of Persia ===
Nowruz, along with the mid-winter celebration Sadeh, survived the Muslim conquest of Persia of 650 CE. Other celebrations such as the Gahambars and Mehrgan were eventually side-lined or only observed by Zoroastrians. Nowruz became the main royal holiday during the Abbasid period. Much like their predecessors in the Sasanian period, Dehqans would offer gifts to the caliphs and local rulers at the Nowruz and Mehragan festivals. 

Following the demise of the caliphate and the subsequent re-emergence of Iranian dynasties such as the Samanids and Buyids, Nowruz became an even more important event. The Buyids revived the ancient traditions of Sassanian times and restored many smaller celebrations that had been eliminated by the caliphate. The Iranian Buyid ruler &#x27;Adud al-Dawla (r. 949–983) customarily welcomed Nowruz in a majestic hall, decked with gold and silver plates and vases full of fruit and colorful flowers. The King would sit on the royal throne, and the court astronomer would come forward, kiss the ground, and congratulate him on the arrival of the New Year. The king would then summon musicians and singers, and invited his friends to gather and enjoy a great festive occasion.

Later Turkic and Mongol invaders did not attempt to abolish Nowruz.

In 1079 CE during the Seljuq dynasty era, a group of eight scholars led by astronomer and polymath Omar Khayyam calculated and established the Jalali calendar, computing the year starting from Nowruz.

The festival along with Mehregan was widely celebrated in Al-Andalus, as the Andalusians from the 9th century onwards strongly identified with many Iranian traditions despite the opposition from the Maliki jurists. Also, from the 10th century onwards the nobility, emirs and governors sponsored the celebrations and festivals. However, the jurists beginning from the 12th century started encouraging the Andalusians to celebrate Mawlid instead.

=== Contemporary era ===
Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Iran and Afghanistan were the only countries that officially observed the ceremonies of Nowruz. When the Caucasian and Central Asian countries gained independence from the Soviets, they also declared Nowruz as a national holiday.

Nowruz was added to the UNESCO List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2010.

== Customs ==
=== House cleaning and shopping ===
House cleaning, or &quot;shaking the house&quot; () is commonly done before the arrival of Nowruz. People start preparing for Nowruz with a major spring cleaning of their homes and by buying new clothes to wear for the New Year, as well as the purchase of flowers. The hyacinth and the tulip are popular and conspicuous.

=== Visiting family and friends ===
During the Nowruz holidays, people are expected to make short visits to the homes of family, friends and neighbors. Typically, young people will visit their elders first, and the elders return their visit later. Visitors are offered tea and pastries, cookies, fresh and dried fruits and mixed nuts or other snacks. Many Iranians throw large Nowruz parties as a way of dealing with the long distances between groups of friends and family.

=== Food preparation ===
One of the most common foods cooked on the occasion of Nowruz is Samanu (Samanak, Somank, Somalek, Sumalak). This food is prepared using wheat germ. In most countries that celebrate Nowruz, this food is cooked. In some countries, cooking this food is associated with certain rituals. Women and girls in different parts of Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan cook Samanu in groups and sometimes during the night, and when cooking it, they sing memorable songs.

Cooking other foods is also common on Nowruz. For example, sabzi polo with fish is eaten on Eid night, as are sweets such as Nan-e Nokhodchi. In general, cooking Nowruz food is common in every region where Nowruz is celebrated, and each area has its food and sweets.

=== &quot;Haft-sin&quot; ===


Typically, before the arrival of Nowruz, family members gather around the Haft-sin table and await the exact moment of the March equinox to celebrate the New Year. The number 7 and the letter S are related to the seven Ameshasepantas as mentioned in the Zend-Avesta. They relate to the four elements of Fire, Earth, Air, Water, and the three life forms of Humans, Animals and Plants. In modern times, the explanation was simplified to mean that the Haft-sin (, seven things beginning with the letter sin (س)) are:
* Sabze () – wheat, barley, mung bean, or lentil sprouts grown in a dish.
* Samanu () – sweet pudding made from wheat germ
* Persian olive ()
* Vinegar ()
* Apple ()
* Garlic ()
* Sumac ()
The Haft-sin table may also include a mirror, candles, painted eggs, a bowl of water, goldfish, coins, hyacinth, and traditional confectioneries. A &quot;book of wisdom&quot; such as the Quran, Bible, Avesta, the  of Ferdowsi, or the divān of Hafez may also be included. Haft-sin&#x27;s origins are not clear. The practice is believed to have been popularized over the past 100 years.

=== &quot;Haft-mewa&quot; ===
In Afghanistan, people prepare Haft Mēwa (, ) for Nauruz, a mixture of seven different dried fruits and nuts (such as raisins, silver berry, pistachios, hazelnuts, prunes, walnut, and almonds) served in syrup.

=== &quot;Khoncha&quot; ===

Khoncha () is the traditional display of Nowruz in Azerbaijan. It consists of a big silver or copper tray, with a tray of green, sprouting wheat (samani) in the middle and a dyed egg for each member of the family arranged around it. The table should contain at least seven dishes.

=== &quot;Amu Nowruz&quot; and &quot;Hajji Firuz&quot; ===

In Iran, the traditional heralds of the festival of Nowruz are Amu Nowruz and Haji Firuz, who appear in the streets to celebrate the New Year.

Amu Nowruz brings children gifts, much like his counterpart Santa Claus. He is the husband of Nane Sarma, with whom he shares a traditional love story in which they can meet each other only once a year. He is depicted as an elderly silver-haired man with a long beard carrying a walking stick, wearing a felt hat, a long cloak of blue canvas, a sash, giveh, and linen trousers.

Haji Firuz, a character with his face and hands covered in soot, clad in bright red clothes and a felt hat, is the companion of Amu Nowruz.

When Nowruz arrives, they play Kos-kosa (a traditional Azerbaijani Nowruz game) with the kids, paint eggs, sing songs and often fight with each other, symbolizing the arrival of spring. Kosa and Kechal have become one of the, if not the most, famous characters in Azerbaijani Nowruz traditions, gaining large amounts of attention and taking part in mainstream talkshows and movies.

Nevruz is celebrated annually in Albania on 22 March as Sultan Nevruz. In Albania, the festival commemorates the birthday of Ali ibn Abi Talib (died 661 CE) and simultaneously the advent of spring.

However, it is celebrated in Armenia by tens of thousands of Iranian tourists who visit Armenia with relative ease. The influx of tourists from Iran accelerated since around 2010–11. In 2010 alone, around 27,600 Iranians spent Nowruz in capital Yerevan.

Members of the Nawab family of Dhaka used to celebrate it amid pomp and grandeur. In the evening, they used to float thousands of candle lights in nearby ponds and water bodies. The National poet Kazi Nazrul Islam, also a Sunni, portrayed a vivid sketch of the festival highlighting its various aspects. In his poem, he described it as a platform of exposing a youth&#x27;s physical and mental beauty to another opposite one for conquering his or her heart.

=== Central Asia ===
Nowruz widely celebrated on a vast territory of Central Asia and ritual practice acquired its special features. The festival was legitimized by prayers at mosques, and visits to the mazars of Muslim saints and to sacred streams. In the Emirate of Bukhara, a broad official celebration of Nowruz was started by Amir Muzaffar, who sought to strengthen the image of the Manghyt dynasty during the crisis of political legitimacy. Currently, all five Central Asian countries (Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan) celebrate Nowruz as a public holiday.

Every year, large festivities are held in the capital Tbilisi, as well as in areas with a significant number of Azerbaijanis, such as the Kvemo Kartli, Kakheti, Shida Kartli, and Mtskheta-Mtianeti regions. Georgian politicians have attended the festivities in the capital over the years, and have congratulated the Nowruz-observing ethnic groups and nationals in Georgia on the day of Nowruz.

=== India ===
The tradition of Nowruz in Northern India dates back to the Mughal Empire; the festival was celebrated for 19 days with pomp and gaiety in the realm. However, it further goes back to the Parsi Zoroastrian community in Western India, who migrated to the Indian subcontinent from Persia during the Muslim conquest of Persia of 636–651 CE. 

In the Princely State of Hyderabad, Nowruz (Nauroz) was one of the four holidays where the Nizam would hold a public Darbar, along with the two official Islamic holidays and the sovereign&#x27;s birthday. Prior to Asaf Jahi rule in Hyderabad, the Qutb Shahi dynasty celebrated Nowruz with a ritual called Panjeri, and the festival was celebrated by all with great grandeur. 

A popular Deccani Urdu poem written by the founder of Hyderabad, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, is recited in the Deccan region on Nauroz:

=== Iran ===
Nowruz is a two-week celebration that marks the beginning of the New Year in Iran&#x27;s official Solar Hijri calendar. The celebration includes four public holidays from the first to the fourth day of Farvardin, the first month of the Iranian calendar, usually beginning on 21 March. On the Eve of Nowruz, the fire festival Chaharshanbe Suri is celebrated. Following the 1979 Revolution, some radical elements from the Islamic government attempted to suppress Nowruz, considering it a pagan holiday and a distraction from Islamic holidays. Nowruz has been politicized, with political leaders making annual Nowruz speeches.

=== Kurdistan ===


Newroz is largely considered as a potent symbol of Kurdish identity. The Kurds of Turkey celebrate this feast between 18 and 21 March. Kurds gather into fairgrounds mostly outside the cities to welcome spring. Women wear colored dresses and spangled head scarves and young men wave flags of green, yellow and red, the historic colors of Kurdish people. They hold this festival by lighting fire and dancing around it. Newroz has seen many bans in Turkey, as Turkey has a strong and long history of trying to suppress Kurdish history and culture. It has only been celebrated legally since 1992 after the ban on the Kurdish language was lifted. The holiday is now officially allowed in Turkey after international pressure on the Turkish government to lift culture bans. The Turkish government renamed the holiday &quot;Nevroz&quot; in 1995. However, Newroz celebrations are still suppressed and lead to continual confrontations with the Turkish authority. In Cizre, Nusyabin and Şırnak celebrations turned violent as Turkish police forces fired in the celebrating crowds. In recent years, the Newroz celebration summons around 1 million participants in Diyarbakır, the biggest city of the Kurdish dominated Southeastern Turkey.

In Syria, the Kurds dress up in their national dress and celebrate the New Year. According to Human Rights Watch, the Kurds have had to struggle to celebrate Newroz, and in the past and the celebration has led to violent oppression, leading to several deaths and mass arrests. The Syrian Arab Ba&#x27;athist government stated in 2004 that the Newroz celebrations will be tolerated as long as they do not become political demonstrations. During the Newroz celebrations in 2008, three Kurds were shot dead by Syrian security forces. In March 2010, an attack by Syrian police killed two or three people, one of them a 15-year-old girl, and more than 50 people were wounded. The Rojava revolution of 2012 and the subsequent establishment of the de facto Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria saw Kurdish civil rights greatly expand, and Newroz is now celebrated freely in most Kurdish areas of Syria except for Efrin, where the ritual is no longer allowed since the 2018 occupation by Turkish-backed rebel groups.

Kurds in Iraq and Iran have had more freedom to celebrate Newroz than their countrymen of Syria and Turkey.

Kurds in the diaspora also celebrate the New Year; for example, Kurds in Australia celebrate Newroz not only as the beginning of the new year, but also as the Kurdish National Day. Similarly, the Kurds in Finland celebrate the new year as a way of demonstrating their support for the Kurdish cause. Also in London, organizers estimated that 25,000 people celebrated Newroz during March 2006. In Canada, the largest Kurdish Newroz festival is held in Ontario. In the States, the city of Nashville, Tennessee includes the largest Kurdish population in the United States. The Kurds celebrate Newroz by holding a Nashville festival; dressed in their traditional clothing, they sing and dance around a fire with their family and friends.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, Nowruz is typically celebrated in parts of Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, especially near the border with Afghanistan, and across Balochistan, with a large celebration held in the capital of Quetta. Recently, the government of Iran has participated in hosting celebrations in Islamabad to commemorate the holiday. Like in India, the Parsi and Isma&#x27;ili communities have historically celebrated the holiday, as have some Shi&#x27;a Muslims.

=== United States ===
Vibrant Persian speaking Immigrant communities have been celebrating Nowruz for decades in the United States. The state of California is considered to have the largest Farsi speaking community in the country. On 19 March 2024, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a proclamation declaring 19 March the day as Nowruz day.

== Theology ==

=== Zoroastrianism ===
Nowruz itself has its origins in Zoroastrianism and is the most important of the Zoroastrian Gahambars or religious feasts. The holiday celebrates the arrival of the spring which Zoroastrians see as a representation of the triumph of good (Asha) over evil (Druj), a central theme of the religion.

=== Baháʼí Faith ===
Naw-Rúz is one of nine holy days for adherents of the Baháʼí Faith worldwide. It is the first day of the Baháʼí calendar, occurring on the vernal equinox around 21 March. The Baháʼí calendar is composed of 19 months, each of 19 days, and each of the months is named after an attribute of God; similarly, each of the 19 days in the month also are named after an attribute of God. The first day and the first month were given the attribute of Bahá, an Arabic word meaning splendour or glory, and thus the first day of the year was the day of Bahá in the month of Bahá. Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, explained that Naw-Rúz was associated with the &quot;Most Great Name&quot; of God, and was instituted as a festival for those who observed the Nineteen-Day Fast.

The day is also used to symbolize the renewal of time in each religious dispensation. ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s son and successor, explained that significance of Naw-Rúz in terms of spring and the new life it brings. He explained that the equinox is a symbol of the messengers of God and the message that they proclaim is like a spiritual springtime, and that Naw-Rúz is used to commemorate it.

As with all Baháʼí holy days, there are few fixed rules for observing Naw-Rúz, and Baháʼís all over the world celebrate it as a festive day, according to local custom. Persian Baháʼís still observe many of the Iranian customs associated with Nowruz such as the Haft-sin, but American Baháʼí communities, for example, may have a potluck dinner, along with prayers and readings from Baháʼí scripture.

=== Shia Islam ===
Shia literature refers to the merits of the day of Nowruz; the Day of Ghadir took place on Nowruz; and the fatwas of major Shia scholars recommend fasting.
Along with Ismailis, Alawites and Alevis, the Twelver Shia also hold the day of Nowruz in high regard. 

It has been said that Musa al-Kadhim, the seventh Twelver Shia imam, has explained Nowruz and said: &quot;In Nowruz God made a covenant with His servants to worship Him and not to allow any partner for Him. To welcome His messengers and obey their rulings. This day is the first day that the fertile wind blew and the flowers on the earth appeared. The archangel Gabriel appeared to the Prophet, and it is the day that Abraham broke the idols. The day Prophet Muhammad held Ali on his shoulders to destroy the Quraishie&#x27;s idols in the house of God, the Kaaba.&quot; 

The day upon which Nowruz falls has been recommended as a day of fasting for Twelver Shia Muslims by Shia scholars, including Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei, Ruhollah Khomeini and Ali al-Sistani. However, Prominent Twelver clerics like the Ayatollahs Ruhollah Khomeini and Ali Khamenei have also disparaged the actual holiday of Nowruz, condemning its origins in Zoroastrianism. The day also assumes special significance for Shias as it has been said that it was on 16 March 632 AD, that the first Shia Imam, Ali, assumed the office of caliphate. Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims around the globe celebrate Nowruz as a religious festival. Special prayers and Majalis are arranged in Jamatkhanas. Special foods are cooked and people share best wishes and prayers with each other.

<text>Paul Bettany (born 27 May 1971) is an English actor. He is best known for his roles as J.A.R.V.I.S. and Vision in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including the Disney+ series &quot;WandaVision&quot; (2021) and the upcoming &quot;Vision Quest&quot; (2026), the former of which garnered him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.

Bettany first gained popularity for appearing in the films &quot;Gangster No. 1&quot; (2000), &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2001) and &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; (2001). He was nominated for a BAFTA Award for playing Stephen Maturin in the film &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; (2003). Other films in which Bettany has appeared include &quot;Dogville&quot; (2003), &quot;Wimbledon&quot; (2004), &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; (2006), &quot;The Tourist&quot; (2010), &quot;Margin Call&quot; (2011), &quot;Legend&quot; (2015) and &quot;&quot; (2018). He made his directorial debut with the film &quot;Shelter&quot; (2014), which he also wrote and co-produced.

In television and theatre, Bettany has portrayed Ian Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll in the series &quot;A Very British Scandal&quot; and Andy Warhol in the play &quot;The Collaboration&quot; in the West End, which later came to Broadway.

==Early life==
Bettany was born on 27 May 1971 in London, to Anne (), a stage singer, theatre teacher, and stage manager, and Thane Bettany, a dancer, actor, drama teacher and godfather to Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh. Bettany was raised Roman Catholic, although his church attendance drifted after his confirmation. Bettany then experimented with other Christian denominations among which were Methodist and Church of England congregations with his father. Bettany is now an atheist. While his father taught at the all-girls boarding school Queenswood School, near Hatfield, Hertfordshire, the family lived on the school grounds.

When Bettany was 16, his brother Matthew died at age 8 after falling onto concrete from a tennis pavilion roof at Queenswood. Soon after, Bettany dropped out of school, left home, and became a street performer in London. He lived in a small flat and earned money by playing his guitar in the streets as a busker. His parents later divorced. After two years, he found a new job in a home for the elderly. After working there for a year, Bettany enrolled at the Drama Centre London.

==Career==
In 1990, at the age of 19, Bettany began a three-year course at the Drama Centre London in Chalk Farm. He made his stage debut in Stephen Daldry&#x27;s acclaimed West End revival of &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot; at the Aldwych Theatre, playing the part of Eric Birling. He also appeared in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s productions of &quot;Richard III&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (for which he received a Charleson Award nomination). When Bettany was 21, he appeared in a BBC production of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, playing Bill Sikes.

After appearing in the finale of Sean Bean&#x27;s series &quot;Sharpe&quot; as William II of the Netherlands at the Battle of Waterloo, he made his film debut with a small part in &quot;Bent&quot;, a Holocaust drama which also featured Clive Owen, Jude Law, and Ian McKellen. He continued doing work in stage and television: these included Joe Penhall&#x27;s &quot;Love and Understanding&quot;, which played at London&#x27;s Bush Theatre and then ran in Connecticut. He had roles in the television productions &quot;Killer Net&quot; and &quot;Coming Home&quot;, during which he met and dated Emily Mortimer. His last stage work was in &quot;One More Wasted Year&quot; and &quot;Stranger&#x27;s House&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre. He filmed several more movies, including his first leading role in &quot;Gangster No. 1&quot;. The British Independent Film Awards nominated him for Best Actor, and the London Film Critics&#x27; Circle nominated him for British Newcomer of the Year. 

Back in Hollywood, writer/director Brian Helgeland (&quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;) was planning a new film called &quot;The Sin Eater&quot; (also known as &quot;The Order&quot;). He was impressed by Bettany&#x27;s audition tape, though Helgeland eventually decided to film &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; instead. The studio executives were not impressed, but Helgeland was determined to cast him, even writing the part of Chaucer for him. &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; would be Bettany&#x27;s first big Hollywood production. He received critical acclaim for &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, including winning the London Film Critics Circle Award for Best British Supporting Actor. After the movie wrapped, Helgeland, determined that Hollywood should recognize Bettany&#x27;s talent, showed the audition tape to many of his peers, including Ron Howard, who promptly cast Bettany in &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; alongside Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly. After &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, Bettany was offered the role of serial killer Francis Dolarhyde in &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, opposite Edward Norton and Anthony Hopkins. He turned down the role due to his commitment to a role in Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Dogville&quot;.

Bettany&#x27;s next major project saw him starring again alongside &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; costar Russell Crowe in Peter Weir&#x27;s &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;. His portrayal of surgeon and naturalist Stephen Maturin brought him a BAFTA nomination, and he was named British Actor of the Year (London Film Critics&#x27; Circle), and Best Actor (&quot;Evening Standard&quot;).

On 28 June 2004, Bettany and 13 other actors were included in the 2004 invitation to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. &quot;Dogville&quot; and &quot;The Reckoning&quot; were released in limited cinemas in 2004. In September of that year, Bettany made his leading-man debut in &quot;Wimbledon&quot;, a romantic comedy with Kirsten Dunst. The film&#x27;s cast would also introduce him to Jon Favreau, playing his manager, a relationship that would return when Favreau cast him as the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S. in &quot;Iron Man&quot;. In mid-2005, Bettany filmed &quot;Firewall&quot; in Vancouver, Canada, a thriller also starring Harrison Ford and Virginia Madsen, which reunited him with &quot;Wimbledon&quot; director Richard Loncraine. He spent the autumn of 2005 filming &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, based on Dan Brown&#x27;s best-selling novel and starring Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou and Ian McKellen. In the film, he played an Opus Dei monk named Silas.

In 2007, Bettany went to London to star in &quot;There For Me&quot;, written by his friends Dan Fredenburgh and Doraly Rosen. In 2008, he appeared in the New Line Cinema family fantasy &quot;Inkheart&quot;, playing the part of a fire-eater named Dustfinger. In 2009, he appeared as Charles Darwin in &quot;&quot;Creation&quot;&quot;, starring opposite his own wife Jennifer Connelly. In 2010, Bettany appeared alongside Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie in &quot;The Tourist&quot; and portrayed the archangel Michael in &quot;Legion&quot;, a film depicting divine vengeance upon humanity. He starred in the films &quot;Priest and Margin Call&quot;, both released in 2011.

Bettany reprised his voice role as J.A.R.V.I.S. in 2010&#x27;s &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;, 2012&#x27;s &quot;The Avengers&quot;, 2013&#x27;s &quot;Iron Man 3&quot;, and Disneyland&#x27;s Innoventions attraction. In 2014, Bettany starred alongside Johnny Depp and fellow British actor Rebecca Hall in the feature film &quot;Transcendence&quot;. He was once again paired with Depp in &quot;Mortdecai&quot;, a 2015 motion picture also starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Ewan McGregor. After voicing J.A.R.V.I.S. for five years, Bettany made his first onscreen appearance in a Marvel Cinematic Universe film in the 2015 film &quot;&quot;, playing Vision. He reprised the role in the sequels &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016) and &quot;&quot; (2018).

Bettany portrayed Ted Kaczynski in the Discovery Channel television show, &quot;&quot;. Bettany replaced Michael K. Williams in &quot;&quot;, after Williams was removed from the final film, as he was unable to return to set during the film&#x27;s reshoots. Bettany was cast in his place, with the character being reworked from a motion-capture alien to a human. On 20 January 2018, it was reported that Bettany was nearing a deal to play Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on the Netflix series &quot;The Crown&quot;, succeeding Matt Smith. Days later, on 25 January, it was reported by TVLine that Bettany was ultimately unable to sign on due to scheduling conflicts.

Bettany starred alongside Elizabeth Olsen in the Marvel television miniseries &quot;WandaVision&quot;, portraying a new version of his Marvel Cinematic Universe character, Vision, with Olsen portraying the titular Wanda. It premiered on Disney+ in January 2021, garnering praise from critics. Reviewing the series, Matt Purslow of &quot;IGN&quot; wrote Bettany &quot;effortlessly takes to the comedic skits&quot; and that he and Olsen &quot;provide a fantastic amount of life, wit, and emotion&quot;. For his performance, Bettany received nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film.

Bettany starred in the 2021 miniseries &quot;A Very British Scandal&quot;. He played artist Andy Warhol in a production of the play &quot;The Collaboration&quot; by Anthony McCarten at the Young Vic in London from February to April 2022. He is slated to reprise the role in a film adaptation of the play. Bettany is attached to portray businessman Alexander Nix in a film about the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal as well as co-write and star in the dramedy film &quot;Harvest Moon&quot;.

Bettany will reprise his role as Vision in the upcoming Disney+ series &quot;Vision Quest&quot; (2026).

==Personal life==
On 1 January 2003, Bettany married American actress Jennifer Connelly in Scotland, whom he met when they starred together in the 2001 film &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;. As a teenager, he had developed a crush on her after seeing her in the 1986 film &quot;Labyrinth&quot;. The September 11 attacks motivated him to act on his feelings for her, and after two days of attempting to contact her, he proposed, despite the fact that they were not yet in a relationship. Soon after their marriage, they moved to Brooklyn Heights after living in Tribeca. The couple have two children together. Bettany is stepfather to Connelly&#x27;s son from a previous relationship.

Bettany is a close friend of actor Johnny Depp since 2010 as they met on the set of &quot;The Tourist&quot;. Text messages between Bettany and Depp from 2013 were used as evidence in 2020 during Depp&#x27;s defamation trial against &quot;The Sun&quot; and in 2022 as part of Depp&#x27;s defamation trial against his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard.
