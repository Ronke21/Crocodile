<text>Richmond is a town in south-west London, west-south-west of Charing Cross. It stands on the River Thames, and features many parks and open spaces, including Richmond Park, and many protected conservation areas, which include much of Richmond Hill. A specific Act of Parliament protects the scenic view of the River Thames from Richmond.
Richmond was founded following King Henry VII&#x27;s building in the early 16th century of Richmond Palace (so named in 1501), from which the town derives its name. (The palace&#x27;s manor itself took its name from King Henry&#x27;s earldom of Richmond, North Yorkshire, the original Richmond.) The town and palace became particularly associated with Queen Elizabeth I (), who spent her last days there. During the 18th century, Richmond Bridge connected the two banks of the Thames, and many Georgian terraces were built, particularly around Richmond Green and on Richmond Hill. Those that have survived remain well preserved, and many have been designated listed buildings on account of their architectural or historic significance. The opening of Richmond railway station in 1846 was a significant event in the absorption of the town into a rapidly expanding London.

In 1890, the town of Richmond, formerly part of the ancient parish of Kingston upon Thames in the county of Surrey, became a municipal borough, which was later extended to include Kew, Ham, Petersham and part of Mortlake (North Sheen). The municipal borough was abolished in 1965, when local-government reorganisation transferred Richmond from Surrey to Greater London.

Since 1965, Richmond has formed part of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. it had a population of 21,469 (in the North Richmond and South Richmond wards). It has a significant commercial and retail centre with a developed day and evening economy. The name &quot;Richmond upon Thames&quot; refers to the London borough as a whole, not to the town of Richmond.

==History==
===Name===
The area was known in the medieval period as Shene, a name first recorded (as &quot;Sceon&quot;) in the 10th century, and which survives in the neighbouring districts of East Sheen (also known as Sheen) and North Sheen. The manor entered royal hands, and the manor house eventually became known as Sheen Palace, before being largely destroyed by fire in 1497. Henry VII rebuilt it and in 1501 named it Richmond Palace, in allusion to his earldom of Richmond and his ancestral honour of Richmond in Yorkshire. The associated settlement took the same name, although for some years the two names were often used in conjunction (for example, &quot;Shene otherwise called Richemount&quot;).

===Royal residence===

Henry I lived briefly in the King&#x27;s house in &quot;Sheanes&quot;. In 1299, Edward I, the &quot;Hammer of the Scots&quot;, took his whole court to the manor house at Sheen, a little east of the bridge and on the riverside, and it thus became a royal residence; William Wallace was executed in London in 1305, and it was in Sheen that the Commissioners from Scotland went down on their knees before Edward.

Edward II, following his defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, founded a monastery for Carmelites at Sheen. When the boy-king Edward III came to the throne in 1327, he gave the manor to his mother Isabella. Edward later spent over £2,000 on improvements, but in the middle of the work, Edward himself died at the manor, in 1377. Richard II was the first English king to make Sheen his main residence, which he did in 1383. Twelve years later, Richard was so distraught at the death of his wife Anne of Bohemia at the age of 28 that, according to Raphael Holinshed, the 16th-century English chronicler, he &quot;caused it [the manor] to be thrown down and defaced; whereas the former kings of this land, being wearie of the citie, used customarily thither to resort as to a place of pleasure, and serving highly to their recreation&quot;. It was rebuilt between 1414 and 1422, but destroyed by fire in 1497.

Following that fire, Henry VII built a new residence at Sheen, and in 1501 he named it Richmond Palace. The theatre company to which Shakespeare belonged performed some plays there during the reign of Elizabeth I. As Queen, Elizabeth spent much of her time at Richmond, as she enjoyed hunting stags in the &quot;Newe Parke of Richmonde&quot; (now Old Deer Park). She died at the palace on 24 March 1603. The palace was no longer in residential use after 1649, but in 1688, James II ordered its partial reconstruction, this time as a royal nursery. The bulk of the palace had decayed by 1779, but surviving structures include the Wardrobe, Trumpeters&#x27; House (built around 1700), and the Gate House, built in 1501. This has five bedrooms and was made available on a 65-year lease by the Crown Estate Commissioners in 1986.

===18th- and 19th-century development===
Beyond the grounds of the old palace, Richmond remained mostly agricultural land until the 18th century. White Lodge, in the middle of what is now Richmond Park, was built as a hunting lodge for George II, and during this period the number of large houses in their own grounds – such as Asgill House and Pembroke Lodge – increased significantly. These were followed by the building of further important houses, including Downe House, Wick House and The Wick on Richmond Hill, as this area became an increasingly fashionable place in which to live. Richmond Bridge was completed in 1777 to replace a ferry crossing that connected Richmond town centre on the east bank with its neighbouring district of East Twickenham. Today, this bridge, together with the well-preserved Georgian terraces that surround Richmond Green and line Richmond Hill to its crest, now has listed building status.

As Richmond continued to prosper and expand during the 19th century, much luxurious housing was built on the streets that line Richmond Hill, as well as shops in the town centre to serve the increasing population. In July 1892, the Corporation formed a joint-stock company, the Richmond (Surrey) Electric Light and Power Company, and this wired the town for electricity by around 1896.

===World Wars===

Like many other large towns in Britain, Richmond lost many young people in the First and Second World Wars. In the Second World War, 96 people were killed in air raids, which also resulted in the demolition of 297 houses. The Richmond War Memorial, which now commemorates both wars, was installed in 1921 at the end of Whittaker Avenue, between the Old Town Hall and the Riverside.

==Governance==
===Current===
The town of Richmond is in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, which is governed by Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council. The most recent election was in May 2022 when the Liberal Democrats retained control of the council; in a January 2024 by-election the Liberal Democrats gained the Conservatives&#x27; only Council seat. Richmond town is divided into two wards – North Richmond, which has three Liberal Democrat councillors, and South Richmond, with two Liberal Democrat councillors and one from the Green Party.

Richmond town forms part of the Richmond Park constituency for the UK Parliament. The MP, since 2019, is Sarah Olney from the Liberal Democrats. Richmond is also part of the South West constituency for the London Assembly, which has been represented by Gareth Roberts from the Liberal Democrats since 2024.

===Historical===
Richmond, earlier known as &quot;Shene&quot;, was part of the large ancient parish of Kingston upon Thames in the Kingston hundred of Surrey. Split off from Kingston upon Thames from an early time, the parish of Richmond St Mary Magdalene formed the Municipal Borough of Richmond from 1890. The municipal borough was expanded in 1892 by the addition of Kew, Petersham and the North Sheen part of Mortlake; in 1933, Ham was added to the borough. In 1965, the parish and municipal borough were abolished by the London Government Act 1963, which transferred Richmond to Greater London. Together with the former Municipal Borough of Twickenham and the former Municipal Borough of Barnes, it formed a new borough, the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.

==Geography==
Richmond sits opposite East Twickenham on what is technically the south bank of the River Thames, but because of the bends of the river, the town is immediately north and north-east of its nearest stretch of river. The Thames curves around the town, and then Kew, in its course; starting from Petersham, it returns to a more direct west–east direction. The river is still tidal at Richmond, so, to allow major passenger and goods traffic to continue to operate during low tide, a half-tide lock was opened in 1894 and is used when the adjacent weir is in position. This weir ensures that there is always a minimum depth of water of 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m) toward the middle of the river between Richmond and Teddington, whatever the state of the tide. At the lock and weir there is a footbridge across the river.

Richmond is well endowed with green and open spaces accessible to the public. At the heart of the town sits Richmond Green, which is roughly square in shape and together with the Little Green, a smaller green space stretching from its southeast corner, is 12 acres (5 hectares) in area. The Green is surrounded by well-used metalled roads that provide a fair amount of vehicle parking for both residents and visitors. The south corner leads into the main shopping area of the town; at the west corner is the old gatehouse which leads through to other remaining buildings of the palace; at the north corner is pedestrian access to Old Deer Park (plus vehicle access for municipal use). The park is a Crown Estate landscape extending from the town along the riverside as far as the boundary with the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This contains wide green lawns and sports facilities, and the Grade I listed former King&#x27;s Observatory erected for George III in 1769. The town&#x27;s main shopping street, George Street, is also named after the king.

The town centre lies just below 33 ft (10 m) above sea level. South of the town centre, rising from Richmond Bridge to an elevation of 165 ft (50 m), is Richmond Hill. Just beyond the summit of Richmond Hill is Richmond Park, an area of 2,360 acres (9.55 km2; 3.7 sq mi) of wild heath and woodland originally enclosed for hunting, and now forming London&#x27;s largest royal park. The park is a national nature reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation and is included, at Grade I, on Historic England&#x27;s Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. It was created by Charles I in 1634 as a deer park and now has 630 red and fallow deer that roam freely through much of the park. The park has a number of traffic and pedestrian gates leading to the surrounding areas of Sheen, Roehampton, Putney, Kingston and Ham.

==Economy==
The London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, with Richmond North and Richmond South as two of its wards, has the least poverty in London. The town of Richmond has the largest commercial centre in the borough and is classified as a major centre according to the London Plan. It is an established up-market shopping destination. Its compact centre has approximately 50,000 m2 of retail floor-space that is largely focused on George Street, The Quadrant and Hill Street. It comprises almost exclusively high street chains, the largest of which are Marks &amp; Spencer, Boots, Tesco Metro and Waitrose. The remaining town centre stores are largely single units.

Mostly independent businesses line the narrow alleyways running off George Street towards Richmond Green and up Richmond Hill, and there is a farmers&#x27; market in Heron Square on Saturdays. Richmond has one large stand-alone supermarket, Sainsbury&#x27;s, with parking for 420 cars, to the east of the town near North Sheen railway station.

A range of convenience shopping, restaurants and cafes can be found on the crest of Richmond Hill lining Friars Stile Road, as well as along Kew Road towards the Botanic Gardens, and on Sheen Road.

Richmond also offers a wide variety of office accommodation and is the UK/European headquarters of several multi-national companies, including eBay, PayPal and The Securitas Group, as well as the head offices of a number of national, regional and local businesses. London&#x27;s &quot;Evening Standard&quot; has described Richmond as &quot;the beating heart of London&#x27;s growing technology industry&quot;.

==Places of interest==
===Richmond Riverside===
The Thames is a major contributor to the interest that Richmond inspires in many people. It has an extensive frontage around Richmond Bridge, containing many bars and restaurants. Richmond Riverside owes much of its neo-Georgian style to the architect Quinlan Terry, who was commissioned to restore the area (1984–87). Within the river itself at this point are the leafy Corporation Island and the two small Flowerpot Islands. The Thames-side walkway provides access to residences, pubs (including the White Cross) and terraces, and various greens, lanes and footpaths through Richmond. The stretch of the Thames below Richmond Hill is known as Horse Reach and includes Glover&#x27;s Island. There are towpaths and tracks along both sides of the river, and they are much used by pedestrians, joggers and cyclists. Westminster Passenger Services Association boats, licensed by
London River Services, sail daily between Kew and Hampton Court Palace, calling at Richmond in each direction.

===Richmond Green===


Richmond Green has been described as &quot;one of the most beautiful urban greens surviving anywhere in England&quot;. It is roughly square in shape, and its open grassland, framed with broadleaf trees, extends to roughly twelve acres (5 hectares). On summer weekends and public holidays the Green attracts many residents and visitors. It has a long history of hosting sporting events; from the 16th century onwards tournaments and archery contests have taken place on the Green, and there have been cricket matches since the mid-18th century, continuing to the present day. Until recently, the first recorded inter-county cricket match was believed to have been played on Richmond Green in 1730 between Surrey and Middlesex. It is now known, however, that an earlier match between Kent and Surrey took place in Dartford in 1709.

To the west of the Green is Old Palace Lane, running gently down to the river. One of the oldest roads in Richmond, it was originally a route from the river, where goods were loaded and unloaded by crane, to the &quot;tradesmen&#x27;s entrance&quot; to Richmond Palace. Adjoining to the left is the renowned terrace of well-preserved three-storey houses known as Maids of Honour Row. These were built in 1724 for the maids of honour (trusted royal wardrobe servants) of Queen Caroline, the queen consort of George II. As a child, the Victorian explorer Richard Burton lived at No. 2.

Today the northern, western and southern sides of the Green are residential while the eastern side, linking with George Street, is largely retail and commercial. Public buildings line the eastern side of the Little Green and pubs and cafés cluster in the corner by Paved Court and Golden Court – two of a number of alleys that lead from the Green to the main commercial thoroughfare of George Street. These alleys are lined with mostly privately owned boutiques.

===Richmond Hill===


Partway up Richmond Hill is the Poppy Factory, staffed mainly by disabled ex-servicemen and women, which produces the remembrance poppies sold each November for Remembrance Day.

The view from the top westward to Windsor has long been famous, inspiring paintings by masters such as J. M. W. Turner and Sir Joshua Reynolds and also poetry. One particularly grand description of the view can be found in Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot; (1818). It is a common misconception that the folk song &quot;Lass of Richmond Hill&quot; relates to this hill, but the young woman in the song lived in Hill House at Richmond in the Yorkshire Dales.

Apart from the great rugby stadium at Twickenham and the aircraft landing and taking off from Heathrow, the scene has changed little in two hundred years. The view from Richmond Hill now forms part of the Thames Landscape Strategy which aims to protect and enhance this section of the river corridor into London.

A broad, gravelled walk runs along the crest of the hill and is set back off the road, lined with benches, allowing pedestrians an uninterrupted view across the Thames valley with visitors&#x27; information boards describing points of interest. Sloping down to the River Thames are the Terrace Gardens that were laid out in the 1880s and were extended to the river some 40 years later.

A commanding feature on the hill is the former Royal Star and Garter Home; in the 2010s it was sold for development and converted into residential apartments. During World War I an old hotel on this site, the Star and Garter, which had been a popular place of entertainment in the 18th and 19th centuries but had closed in 1906, was taken over and used as a military hospital. After the war it was replaced by a new building providing accommodation and nursing facilities for 180 seriously injured servicemen. This was sold in 2013 after the charitable trust running the home concluded that the building no longer met modern requirements and could not be easily or economically upgraded. The trust opened an additional home in Solihull, West Midlands, and the remaining residents in Richmond moved in 2013 to a new purpose-built building in Surbiton.

===Richmond Park===
At the top of Richmond Hill, opposite the former Royal Star and Garter Home, sits the Richmond Gate entrance to Richmond Park. The park is a national nature reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and a Special Area of Conservation. The largest of London&#x27;s Royal Parks, it was created by Charles I in 1634 as a deer park and now has over 600 red and fallow deer. Richmond Gate remains open to traffic between dawn and dusk.

King Henry&#x27;s Mound, a Grade II listed Neolithic burial barrow, is the highest point within the park. From the mound there is a protected view, established in 1710, of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in the City of London over 10 miles (16 km) to the east. At various times the mound&#x27;s name has been connected with Henry VIII or with his father Henry VII. However, there is no evidence to support the legend that Henry VIII stood on the mound to watch for the sign from St Paul&#x27;s that Anne Boleyn had been executed at the Tower and that he was then free to marry Jane Seymour.

King Henry&#x27;s Mound is in the grounds of Pembroke Lodge, which is Grade II listed. In 1847 this house became the home of the then Prime Minister, Lord John Russell, who conducted much government business there and entertained Queen Victoria, foreign royalty, aristocrats, writers (Dickens, Thackeray, Longfellow, Tennyson) and other notable people of the time, including Giuseppe Garibaldi. It was later the childhood home of Lord John Russell&#x27;s grandson, the philosopher, mathematician and social critic Bertrand Russell. It is now a popular restaurant with views across the Thames Valley.

Built as a hunting lodge for George II by the architect Roger Morris, White Lodge was completed in 1730. Its many famous residents have included members of the Royal Family. The future king Edward VIII was born at White Lodge in 1894; his brother Prince Albert, Duke of York (the future George VI) and the Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother) lived there in the 1920s. The Royal Ballet School (formerly Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet) has been based since 1955 at the lodge, where younger ballet students continue to be trained.

Also in the park and Grade II listed is Thatched House Lodge, which is still a royal residence. Since 1963 it has been the home of Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy, a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. General Dwight D Eisenhower, who later became President of the United States, lived there during the Second World War.

===Museums and galleries===
The Museum of Richmond, in Richmond&#x27;s Old Town Hall, close to Richmond Bridge, has displays relating to the history of Richmond, Ham, Petersham and Kew. Its rotating exhibitions, education activities and a programme of events cover the whole of the modern borough. The museum&#x27;s highlights include 16th-century glass from Richmond Palace and a painting, &quot;The Terrace and View from Richmond Hill, Surrey&quot; by Dutch draughtsman and painter Leonard Knyff (1650–1722), which is part of the Richmond upon Thames Borough Art Collection. Admission to the museum is free.

The Riverside Gallery, also at the Old Town Hall, features temporary exhibitions by local artists including paintings, prints and photographs. Admission is free.

===Theatres and cinemas===
Richmond has two theatres. Richmond Theatre on Little Green is a late Victorian structure designed by Frank Matcham and restored and extended by Carl Toms in 1990. The theatre has a weekly schedule of plays and musicals, usually given by professional touring companies, and pre-West End shows can sometimes be seen. There is a Christmas and New Year pantomime tradition and many of Britain&#x27;s greatest music hall and pantomime performers have appeared here.

Close to Richmond railway station is the Orange Tree Theatre which was founded in 1971 in a room above the Orange Tree pub. As audience numbers increased, there was pressure to find a more accommodating space and, in 1991, the company moved to its current premises within a converted primary school. The 172-seat theatre was built specifically as a theatre-in-the-round. Exclusively presenting its own productions, it has acquired a national reputation for the quality of its work for staging new plays, and for discovering undeservedly forgotten old plays and neglected classics.

The town has two cinemas, the arthouse Curzon in Water Lane and an Odeon cinema with a total of seven screens in two locations, the foyer of one having the accolade of being the only high street building visible from Richmond Bridge, and the second set being situated nearby in Red Lion Street. The Odeon on Hill Street, built in 1930, is in Art Deco style and is Grade II listed.

===Historic public houses===
Numerous public houses and bars scattered throughout Richmond&#x27;s town centre, and along the river and up the hill, with enough variety to cater to most tastes. One of the oldest is The Cricketers, serving beer since 1770, though the original building was burned down in 1844. It was soon replaced by the present building. Samuel Whitbread, founder of Whitbread Brewery, part-owned it with the Collins family who had a brewery in Water Lane, close to the old palace. Grade II listed pubs include the White Cross, the Old Ship and the Britannia.

===Restaurants and cafes===
Many of the major restaurant chains can be found within 500 metres of Richmond Bridge. There are also plenty of privately owned restaurants with culinary offerings from around the world, including French, German, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Thai.

The Bingham Riverhouse hotel was awarded its first Michelin star in 2010. Overlooking the Thames, it is in a Grade II listed building dating from about 1760.

==Societies==


The Richmond Local History Society explores the local history of Richmond, Kew, Petersham and Ham. It organises a programme of talks on history topics and visits to buildings of historical interest. The Society publishes a newsletter three times a year, an indexed journal (&quot;Richmond History&quot;) and other publications.

The Richmond Society is a civic society and conservation group which was founded in 1957 by a group of local residents, originally to fight against the proposal to install modern lamp posts around Richmond Green. It acts as a pressure group concerned with preserving Richmond&#x27;s natural and built environment, monitoring and influencing development proposals and presenting annual awards for buildings and other schemes which make a positive contribution to Richmond. It also organises meetings on topics of local interest and a programme of guided walks and visits, and publishes a quarterly newsletter. The Society&#x27;s patrons are: Anita Anand; Professor Ian Bruce; John, Lord Lee of Trafford; Sir Trevor McDonald; Ronny, Baroness van Dedem; and Lord Watson of Richmond.

==Leisure activities==
With a third of the borough being green and open space, Richmond has much to offer in the way of leisure activities.

===Boating===
Skiffs (fixed seat boats) can be hired by the hour from local boat builders close to the bridge, with opportunities to row upstream towards the historic properties Ham House and Marble Hill House. Richmond Canoe Club, founded in 1944 and now Britain&#x27;s biggest canoe club, is also on the towpath south of Richmond Bridge.

===Cycling===
Richmond is part of the London Cycle Network, offering on and off-road cycle paths throughout the area, including along the Thames towpath and in Richmond Park.

===Equestrian activities===

Richmond Park also has bridle paths, and horses can be rented from a number of stables around the perimeter of the park.

Ham Polo Club is on the Petersham Road at the bottom of Richmond Hill. The club was established in 1926 and is now the only polo club in London; it is popular with picnickers during the summer months.

===Field sports===
Old Deer Park provides open recreation areas, football, rugby and other pitches, and has a leisure centre, Pools on the Park. The leisure centre is run by the borough council, and has 33m indoor and outdoor pools and a fitness centre. 

The park also includes the Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club with both golf and pitch and putt courses, and the Richmond Athletic Ground, home to Richmond F.C. and London Scottish rugby clubs. 

An additional sports ground at Old Deer Park is home to both the Richmond Cricket Club and the London Welsh Rugby Union club, as well as tennis courts and a bowling green. The Prince&#x27;s Head Cricket Club holds fixtures on Richmond Green throughout the summer.

===Running===
5K Parkrun events take place every Saturday morning at Old Deer Park and Richmond Park.

==Education==
==Demography and housing==

===German residents===
The town and the borough of Richmond have been popular destinations for German expatriates and German British since at least the 19th century. Richmond resident Sir Max Waechter, a German-born businessman and advocate of a federal Europe, donated Glover&#x27;s Island to the local council in 1900. The German School London opened in nearby Petersham in 1971, continuing the popularity of Richmond for German families settling in London.

==Transport==
Thirty per cent of Richmond households do not have a car or van. This figure is well above the borough average of 24%, which may be related to the excellent transport links in the area and the lower proportion of families as reported in the 2001 census. A half of households have one car, in line with the borough average.

===Rail===

===Roads===
Richmond&#x27;s main arterial road, the A316, running between Chiswick and the M3 motorway, bisects Old Deer Park and the town to its north. The town&#x27;s only dual carriageway, it was built in the 1930s, cutting off Richmond from Kew and entailing the construction of Twickenham Bridge. This road expands into three lanes and motorway status three and five miles west respectively.

The town centre is on the A307, which used to be the main link between London and north-west Surrey, and was previously one of the main routes of the Portsmouth Road before that was diverted; and on the A305, which runs from East Sheen and over Richmond Bridge to Twickenham.

==Film locations==
Richmond is a popular filming location. The village green, divided into The Green and Little Green, has Georgian splendour, stately listed buildings and paved alleyways leading to the high street. It is a magnet for film crews, particularly when recreating a city square or row of townhouses of bygone years. In 2011, &quot;The Crimson Petal and the White&quot; was filmed there, as was &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; in July 2014. Many other films and TV shows have featured The Green or Little Green, including &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;, &quot;Simon Schama&#x27;s Power of Art&quot; and &quot;Peter Rabbit 2&quot;.

The 2020-23 sports comedy TV series &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; is set in Richmond. Several filming sequences take place on The Green, Ted Lasso and other characters in the series are shown drinking at the Prince&#x27;s Head pub (rebranded as The Crown and Anchor) and Ted lives in number 9½ Paved Court (actually No. 11A).

Richmond Theatre ranks as a major film location; it has featured in &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; (1957), &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; (1976), &quot;The Krays&quot; (1990), &quot;Evita&quot; (1996), &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (2000), &quot;The Hours&quot; (2002), &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Wolfman&quot; (2010).

===Richmond Park===
Richmond Park has featured in many films and TV series.
*A locomotive runs through the park and crashes into a tree in the film &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot; (1955).
*As Chas Devlin in the 1968 film &quot;Performance&quot;, James Fox crosses Richmond Park in a Rolls-Royce car.
*The park was the backdrop for the classic historical film &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; (1969), with Richard Burton and Geneviève Bujold, which looks back to Richmond Park in the 16th century. The film tells the story of King Henry VIII&#x27;s courtship of Anne Boleyn and their brief marriage.
*An Indian dust storm was filmed in the park for the film &quot;Heat and Dust&quot; (1983).
*The Royal Ballet School in Richmond Park featured in the film &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; (2000).
*In 2010, director Guy Ritchie filmed parts of &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot; (2011) in the park with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law.
*Some of the scenes from &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (2014), the Disney fantasy film featuring Meryl Streep, were filmed in the park.

As well as a location for films, Richmond Park is regularly featured in television programmes, corporate videos and fashion shoots. It has made an appearance on &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, &quot;Inside Out&quot; (the BBC regional current affairs programme) and BBC &quot;Springwatch&quot;. In 2014 it was featured in a video commissioned by The Hearsum Collection and in 2017 in a television film featuring and narrated by David Attenborough, which was produced by the Friends of Richmond Park.

<doc id="211229" wikidata="Q731870" url="?curid=211229" title="Dire Straits (album)">
<text>Dire Straits is the debut studio album by the British rock band Dire Straits, released on 9 June 1978 by Vertigo Records internationally, Warner Bros. Records in the United States and Mercury Records in Canada. The album features the hit single &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, which reached number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and number 8 on the UK Singles Chart. The album reached the top of the album charts in Germany, Australia and France, number 2 in the United States and number 5 in the United Kingdom. &quot;Dire Straits&quot; was later certified double platinum in both the United States and the United Kingdom by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) respectively.

==Recording==
&quot;Dire Straits&quot; was recorded at Basing Street Studios in London from 13 February to 5 March 1978. Knopfler used a few guitars for the recording, including a pair of red Fender Stratocasters—one from 1961 (serial number 68354) and one from 1962 (serial number 80470). He played his 1938 National Style O 14 fret guitar (serial number B1844) on &quot;Water of Love&quot; and &quot;Wild West End&quot;. He also used a black Telecaster Thinline (serial number 226254) on &quot;Setting Me Up&quot;. David played a black Fender Stratocaster and a Harmony Sovereign acoustic guitar. The album was produced by Muff Winwood, and engineered by Rhett Davies, assisted by Greg Cobb.

==Release==
The album was released in the US on 20 October 1978. The first single released was &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; which first broke into the United States top five early in the spring of 1979, becoming a hit a full five months after the album was released there, and then reached number eight in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Water of Love&quot; was also released as a single in some countries, and charted in Australia, reaching number 54, and in the Netherlands, reaching number 28.

&quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; was re-released as a single in the UK in November 1988 to promote the greatest hits compilation &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, released in October that year.

The album was remastered and reissued with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 to most of the world excluding the U.S. and on 19 September 2000 in the United States.

==Artwork==
The album cover artwork is designed by Hothouse, who commissioned the cover painting from Chuck Loyola. The Dire Straits Fender logo, which appears on the back cover, was designed by Geoff Halpern.

==Touring==

Dire Straits promoted the release of their first single and album with the Dire Straits Tour, which started on 6 June 1978 at the Lafayette Club in Wolverhampton, included 55 shows, ending on 18 November 1978 at the College of Education in Hitchin. The European tour included concerts in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. These concerts presented Dire Straits with their largest audiences to that date. The first leg of the tour promoted their first single, &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;. This first leg took the band around Great Britain in June and July 1978, performing in England, Scotland and Wales. The band typically performed in small halls with a maximum capacity of 1,000. The second leg of the tour promoted the band&#x27;s debut album. This leg took the band to several European countries, where they met journalists and performed on television programmes.

==Critical reception==

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album &quot;remarkably accomplished for a debut&quot;. Erlewine praised Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;spare, tasteful guitar lines and his husky warbling&quot; and his &quot;inclination toward Dylanesque imagery, which enhances the smoky, low-key atmosphere of the album&quot;.

In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Ken Tucker wrote that the band &quot;plays tight, spare mixtures of rock, folk and country music with a serene spirit and witty irony. It&#x27;s almost as if they were aware that their forte has nothing to do with what&#x27;s currently happening in the industry, but couldn&#x27;t care less.&quot; Tucker singled out &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; for its &quot;inescapable hook&quot; and &quot;Bob Dylan-like snarl in its vocal&quot;. He also praised &quot;Setting Me Up&quot; as a &quot;heavenly number, funny and bitter&quot;.

<doc id="211232" wikidata="Q607560" url="?curid=211232" title="Communiqué (Dire Straits album)">
<text>Communiqué is the second studio album by British rock band Dire Straits, released on 5 June 1979 by Vertigo Records internationally, Warner Bros. Records in the United States and Mercury Records in Canada. The album featured the single &quot;Lady Writer&quot;, which reached number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and number 51 on the UK Singles Chart. The album reached number one on album charts in Germany, Spain, New Zealand, and Sweden, number 11 in the United States and number 5 in the United Kingdom. &quot;Communiqué&quot; was later certified gold in the United States, platinum in the United Kingdom and double-platinum in France.

It is the last album to feature David Knopfler, who departed from the band during the making of their following album, and the last with the original lineup.

==Recording==
After the Dire Straits Tour finished in Hitchin on 18 November 1978, Dire Straits set to work on recording their second album. The recording sessions for &quot;Communiqué&quot; took place from 28 November to 12 December 1978 at Compass Point Studios in Nassau. The album was mixed in January 1979 at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Alabama. The album was produced by Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett, veteran producers from Muscle Shoals Sound Studio. Beckett (credited as B. Bear) also contributed keyboards to some of the album&#x27;s nine tracks.

==Release==
&quot;Communiqué&quot; was released on vinyl LP and cassette on 5 June 1979, eight months after the release of the band&#x27;s self-titled debut. It entered the German charts at number one, while its predecessor was still at number three.

&quot;Lady Writer&quot; was the first single released from &quot;Communiqué&quot;. &quot;Communiqué&quot; was remastered and reissued with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 for most of the world outside the United States and on 19 September 2000 in the United States.

Dire Straits toured throughout 1979 after the recording sessions were completed. The Communiqué Tour started in February 1979 in Rotterdam, four months before the album&#x27;s release in June. Dire Straits would play a total of 116 concerts in Europe and North America, the final concert taking place on 21 December 1979 in London.

&quot;Communiqué&quot; was the last album to feature David Knopfler, who left the band over creative differences with his brother during the recording of their third album in August 1980. It is the only Dire Straits album not represented on the compilation &quot;Private Investigations: The Best of Dire Straits &amp; Mark Knopfler&quot;.

==Artwork==
The album cover was designed by Hothouse, art directed by Alan Schmidt with the cover illustration by Geoff Halpin.

==Critical reception==

In a 1979 review for the &quot;Birmingham Daily Post&quot;, Jonathan Daümler-Ford called it a &quot;competent record&quot;, but wrote that &quot;the songs sound like pale imitations, or the cuts which were not good enough for &quot;Dire Straits&quot;&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot; said of &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; that Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;unique and super-sensitive vocals evoke vivid imagery that&#x27;s totally enhanced by the Wexler-Beckett production team.&quot; The &quot;Tucson Citizen&quot; called the album &quot;an appealing production,&quot; writing that &quot;a combination of country and reggae can be substantial.&quot;

In his retrospective review for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann wrote that the second album &quot;seemed little more than a carbon copy of its predecessor with less compelling material.&quot;

<text>Klaus Kinski (, born Klaus Günter Karl Nakszynski 18 October 1926 – 23 November 1991) was a German actor. Equally renowned for his intense performance style and notorious for his volatile personality, he appeared in over 130 film roles in a career that spanned 40 years, from 1948 to 1988. He is best known for starring in five films directed by Werner Herzog from 1972 to 1987 (&quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot;; &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot;; &quot;Woyzeck&quot;; &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot;; and &quot;Cobra Verde&quot;), who would later chronicle their tumultuous relationship in the documentary &quot;My Best Fiend&quot;.

Kinski&#x27;s roles spanned multiple genres, languages, and nationalities, including Spaghetti Westerns, horror films, war films, dramas, and Edgar Wallace &quot;krimi&quot; films. His infamy was elevated by a number of eccentric creative endeavors, including a one-man show based on the life of Jesus Christ, a biopic of violinist Niccolò Paganini directed by and starring himself, and over twenty spoken word albums.

Kinski was prone to emotional and often violent outbursts aimed at his directors and fellow cast members, issues complicated by a history of mental illness. Herzog described him as &quot;one of the greatest actors of the century, but also a monster and a great pestilence.&quot;

Posthumously, he was accused of physically and sexually abusing his daughter Pola. His notoriety and prolific output have developed into a widespread cult following and a reputation as a popular icon.

==Early life==
Klaus Günter Karl Nakszynski was born on 18 October 1926 in Zoppot, Free City of Danzig (now Sopot, Poland), to Polish-German parents. His father, Bruno Nakszynski, worked as an opera singer before becoming a pharmacist, while his mother, Susanne Lutze, was a nurse and the daughter of a local pastor. He had three older siblings; Inge, Arne and Hans-Joachim. Due to the Great Depression, his family was unable to make a living in Danzig and moved to Berlin in 1931, where they also experienced financial difficulties. The family settled in an apartment in the Schöneberg district of the city and acquired German citizenship. In 1936, he began attending the in Schöneberg.

Kinski was conscripted into the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; in 1943 at the age of 17, serving in a unit. He saw no action until the winter of 1944, when his unit was transferred to the German-occupied Netherlands and he was captured by the British Army on his second day of combat. In his 1988 autobiography, he claimed that he had decided to desert from the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and had been recaptured by German forces and sentenced to death in a court-martial before escaping and hiding in the woods, subsequently encountering a British patrol which shot him in the arm and captured him. After being treated for his wounds and interrogated, he was transferred to a prisoner-of-war camp in Colchester, Essex; the ship transporting him to Britain was torpedoed by a German U-boat but arrived safely.

In his documentary &quot;My Best Fiend&quot;, Werner Herzog claimed that Kinski had fabricated much of his 1988 autobiography, including claims of maternal sexual abuse, incest, and childhood poverty; according to Herzog, Kinski was actually raised in a financially stable upper middle class family.

==Career==
While interned at Berechurch Hall in Colchester, Kinski played his first roles on stage, taking part in variety shows intended to maintain morale among the prisoners. By May 1945, at the end of the war in Europe, the German POWs were anxious to return home. Kinski had heard that sick prisoners were to be returned first, and tried to qualify by standing outside naked at night, drinking urine and eating cigarettes. He remained healthy, however, and was returned to Germany in 1946.

Arriving in Berlin, he learned his father had died during the war, and his mother had been killed in an Allied air attack on the city.
===Theatrical career===
After his return to Germany, Kinski started out as an actor, first at a small touring company in Offenburg, where he first used the name &quot;Klaus Kinski&quot;. In 1946, he was hired by the renowned Schlosspark-Theater in Berlin, but he was fired the following year due to his unpredictable behavior. He found work at other theater companies thereafter, but his emotional volatility regularly got him into trouble.

For three months in 1955, Kinski lived in the same boarding house as a 13-year-old Werner Herzog, who would later direct him in a number of films. In &quot;My Best Fiend&quot;, Herzog described how Kinski once locked himself in the communal bathroom for 48 hours and broke everything in the room.

In March 1956, he made a guest appearance at Vienna&#x27;s Burgtheater in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Torquato Tasso&quot;. Although respected by his colleagues, among them Judith Holzmeister, and cheered by the audience, Kinski did not gain a permanent contract after the Burgtheater&#x27;s management became aware of his earlier difficulties in Germany. Kinski then unsuccessfully tried to sue the company.

Living jobless in Vienna, Kinski reinvented himself as a monologist and spoken word artist. He presented the prose and verse of François Villon, William Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde, amongst others, and toured Austria, Germany, and Switzerland with his shows.

===Film work===

Kinski&#x27;s first film role was a small part in the 1948 film &quot;Morituri&quot;. He appeared in several German Edgar Wallace movies, and had bit parts in the American war films &quot;Decision Before Dawn&quot; (1951), &quot;A Time to Love and a Time to Die&quot; (1958), and &quot;The Counterfeit Traitor&quot; (1962). In Alfred Vohrer&#x27;s &quot;Die toten Augen von London&quot; (1961), his character refused any personal guilt for his evil deeds and claimed to have only followed the orders given to him. Kinski&#x27;s performance reflected post-war Germany&#x27;s reluctance to take responsibility for what had happened during World War II.

During the 1960s and 1970s, he appeared in various European exploitation films, as well as more acclaimed works such as &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965), in which he appeared as an anarchist prisoner on his way to the Gulag.

He relocated to Italy during the late 1960s, and found roles in numerous Spaghetti Westerns, including &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; (1965), &quot;A Bullet for the General&quot; (1966), &quot;The Great Silence&quot; (1968), &quot;Twice A Judas&quot; (1969), and &quot;A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe&quot; (1975). In 1977, he starred as the RZ guerrillero Wilfried Böse in &quot;Operation Thunderbolt&quot;, based on the events of the Entebbe raid.

Kinski&#x27;s work with Werner Herzog brought him international recognition. They made five films together: &quot;Aguirre: The Wrath of God&quot; (1972), &quot;Woyzeck&quot; (1979), &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot; (1979), &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; (1982) and &quot;Cobra Verde&quot; (1987). The working relationship between the two was contentious; Herzog had threatened, on occasion, to murder Kinski. In one incident, Kinski was said to have been saved by his dog who attacked Herzog as he crept up to supposedly burn down the actor&#x27;s house. Herzog has refused to comment on his numerous other plans to kill Kinski. However, he did pull a gun on Kinski, or at least threatened to do so, on the set of &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God,&quot; after the actor threatened to walk off the set. Late in the filming of &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; in Peru, the chief of the Machiguenga tribe offered to kill Kinski for Herzog, but the director declined.

In 1980, Kinski refused the lead villain role of Major Arnold Toht in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, telling director Steven Spielberg that the script was &quot;a yawn-making, boring pile of shit&quot; and &quot;moronically shitty&quot;. Kinski would go on to play Kurtz, an Israeli intelligence officer, in &quot;The Little Drummer Girl&quot;, a feature film by George Roy Hill in 1984.

Kinski co-starred in the science fiction television film &quot;Timestalkers&quot; with William Devane and Lauren Hutton. His last film was &quot;Paganini&quot; (1989), which he wrote, directed, and starred in as Niccolò Paganini.

==Personal life==
Kinski was married three times. He married his first wife, singer Gislinde Kühlbeck, in 1952. The couple had a daughter, Pola Kinski. They divorced in 1955. Five years later he married actress Ruth Brigitte Tocki. They divorced in 1971. Their daughter Nastassja Kinski was born in January 1961. He married his third and final wife, model Minhoi Geneviève Loanic, in 1971. Their son Nikolai Kinski was born in 1976. They divorced in 1979.

Kinski published his autobiography, &quot;All I Need Is Love&quot;, in 1988 (reprinted in 1996 as &quot;Kinski Uncut&quot;). The book prompted his second daughter Nastassja Kinski to file a libel suit against him, which she afterward withdrew.

===Mental illness===
In 1950, Kinski stayed at the &quot;Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik&quot; (de), a psychiatric hospital in West Berlin, for three days after stalking his theatrical sponsor and attempting to strangle her. Medical records from the period listed a preliminary diagnosis of schizophrenia, but the doctors&#x27; ultimate conclusion was psychopathy (antisocial personality disorder). Kinski soon became unable to secure film roles, and in 1955 he attempted suicide twice.
=== Sexual abuse allegations===
In 2013, more than 20 years after her father&#x27;s death, Pola Kinski published an autobiography titled &quot;Kindermund&quot; (or &quot;From a Child&#x27;s Mouth&quot;), in which she claimed her father had sexually abused her from the age of 5 to 19.

In an interview published by the German tabloid &quot;Bild&quot; on 14 January 2013, Kinski&#x27;s younger daughter and Pola&#x27;s half-sister, Nastassja, said their father would embrace her in a sexual manner when she was 4–5 years old but never had sex with her. Nastassja has expressed support for Pola and said that she was always afraid of their father, whom she described as an unpredictable tyrant.

In a scathing obituary of Kinski published in 1991, Spanish film director Fernando Colomo alleged that Kinski had tried to rape actress Maria Lamor during the filming of &quot;The Knight of the Dragon.&quot;

==Death==
Kinski died on 23 November 1991 of a sudden heart attack at his home in Lagunitas, California; he was 65 years old. His body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean. Of his three children, only his son Nikolai attended his funeral.

==Legacy==

In &quot;My Best Fiend&quot;, his 1999 documentary about Kinski, Werner Herzog claimed that Kinski had fabricated much of his autobiography, and told of the difficulties in their working relationship. In the same year, director David Schmoeller released a short film entitled &quot;Please Kill Mr. Kinski&quot;, which examined Kinski&#x27;s erratic and disruptive behavior on the set of Schmoeller&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Crawlspace&quot;. The film features behind-the-scenes footage of Kinski&#x27;s various confrontations with the director and crew, along with Schmoeller&#x27;s account of the events, in which he claims a producer offered to murder Kinski for his life insurance money.

In 2006, Christian David published the first comprehensive biography of Kinski, based on newly discovered archived material, personal letters and interviews with the actor&#x27;s friends and colleagues. Peter Geyer published a paperback book of essays on Kinski&#x27;s life and work.

<text>Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts (also simply known as Lincoln Center) is a complex of buildings in the Lincoln Square neighborhood on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. It has thirty indoor and outdoor facilities and is host to 5 million visitors annually. It houses internationally renowned performing arts organizations including the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Ballet, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center and the Juilliard School.

==History==
===Planning===


A consortium of civic leaders and others, led by and under the initiative of philanthropist
John D. Rockefeller III, built Lincoln Center as part of the &quot;Lincoln Square Renewal Project&quot; during Robert Moses&#x27;s program of New York&#x27;s urban renewal in the 1950s and 1960s. Respected architects were contracted to design the major buildings on the site.

Rockefeller was appointed as the Lincoln Center&#x27;s inaugural president in 1956, and once he resigned, became its chairman in 1961. He is credited with raising more than half of the $184.5 million in private funds needed to build the complex, including drawing from his own funds; the Rockefeller Brothers Fund also contributed to the project. Numerous architects were hired to build different parts of the center (see ). The center&#x27;s first three buildings, David Geffen Hall (formerly Avery Fisher Hall, originally named Philharmonic Hall), David H. Koch Theater (formerly the New York State Theater), and the Metropolitan Opera House were opened in 1962, 1964, and 1966, respectively.

It is unclear whether the center was named as a tribute to U.S. President Abraham Lincoln or for its location in the Lincoln Square Neighborhood. The name was bestowed on the area in 1906 by the New York City Board of Aldermen, but records give no reason for choosing that name. There has long been speculation that the name came from a local landowner, because the square was previously named Lincoln Square. However, property records from the New York Municipal Archives from that time have no record of a Lincoln surname; they only list the names Johannes van Bruch, Thomas Hall, Stephen De Lancey, James De Lancey, James De Lancey Jr. and John Somerindyck. One speculation is that references to President Lincoln were omitted from the records because the mayor in 1906 was George B. McClellan Jr., son of General George B. McClellan, who was general-in-chief of the Union Army early in the American Civil War and a bitter rival of Lincoln&#x27;s.

===Construction milestones===

In 1955, the first city institution to commit to be part of the Lincoln Square Renewal Project, an effort to revitalize the city&#x27;s west side with a new performing arts complex that would become the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, was the Fordham Law School of Fordham University. In 1961, Fordham Law School was the first building to open as part of the renewal project, and in 1968, Fordham College at Lincoln Center welcomed its first students.

The development of the condominium at 3 Lincoln Center, completed in 1991, designed by Lee Jablin of Harman Jablin Architects, made possible the expansion of The Juilliard School and the School of American Ballet.

The center&#x27;s cultural institutions also have since made use of facilities located away from the main campus. In 2004, the center expanded through the addition of Jazz at Lincoln Center&#x27;s newly built facilities, the Frederick P. Rose Hall, at the new Time Warner Center, located a few blocks to the south. In March 2006, the center launched construction on a major redevelopment plan that modernized, renovated, and opened up its campus. Redevelopment was completed in 2012 with the completion of the President&#x27;s Bridge over West 65th Street.

===Renovations===
When first announced in 1999, Lincoln Center&#x27;s campus-wide redevelopment was to cost $1.5 billion over 10 years and radically transform the campus. The center management held an architectural competition, won by the British architect Norman Foster in 2005, but did not approve a full scale redesign until 2012, in part because of the need to raise $300 million in construction costs and the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s fear that it might lose audiences and revenue while it was displaced. Among the architects that have been involved were Frank Gehry; Cooper, Robertson &amp; Partners; Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill; Beyer Blinder Belle; Fox &amp; Fowle; Olin Partnership; and Diller &amp; Scofidio.

In March 2006, the center launched the 65th Street Project – part of a major redevelopment plan continuing through the fall of 2012 – to create a new pedestrian promenade designed to improve accessibility and the aesthetics of that area of the campus. Additionally, Alice Tully Hall was modernized and reopened to critical and popular acclaim in 2009 and Film at Lincoln Center expanded with the new Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center. Topped by a sloping lawn roof, the film center is part of a new pavilion that also houses a destination restaurant named Lincoln, as well as offices. Subsequent projects were added which addressed improvements to the main plazas and Columbus Avenue Grand Stairs. Under the direction of the Lincoln Center Development Project, Diller Scofidio + Renfro in association with FXFOWLE Architects and Beyer Blinder Belle Architects provided the design services. Additionally, Turner Construction Company and RCDolner, LLC were the construction managers for the projects. Another component to redevelopment was the addition of the David Rubenstein Atrium designed by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, a visitors&#x27; center and a gateway to the center that offers free performances, day-of-discount tickets, food, and free Wi-Fi.

In 2019, Diamond Schmitt Architects was appointed Design and Executive Architect for the master plan and renovation of David Geffen Hall (previously Avery Fisher Hall) concert theater and masterplan. Diamond Schmitt designed the concert hall and back of house spaces while TWBTA designed the public spaces. When the Hall reopened in 2022, the main auditorium was renamed the Wu Tsai Theatre after a $50 million donation from Joseph Tsai and Clara Wu Tsai.

Partnering with the Rockefeller Foundation, the new pilot grant program offers one-time grants to non-profit organizations to provide cultural activities in these communities in the diverse neighborhoods of Central Brooklyn and the South Bronx. Each of the 12 grantees will receive support and financial backing for their project based on organizational budget size. These are one-year long projects, and grant amounts range from $50,000–$100,000. The over-all goal of the program is to support non-profit organizations in creating cultural innovative strategies that cultivate participation in the arts as well as increase the range and availability of cultural activities to underserved communities.

<text>Scopwick is a small village and civil parish in the district of North Kesteven, Lincolnshire, England, situated south from Lincoln. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 815. The parish includes Kirkby Green, a hamlet to the east of Scopwick. The village main road runs parallel to a narrow stream.

The name Scopwick comes from old English. Scaep was an old word for sheep and wick meant farm.
The village cemetery includes a War Graves site for airmen from RAF Coleby Grange and RAF Digby (originally RAF Scopwick), and includes the grave of the nineteen-year-old Second World War poet and aviator John Gillespie Magee, who wrote the celebrated poem ‘High Flight’.

Part of the brick tower of Scopwick Tower Mill, which was built in 1827 and fell into disuse around 1912, remains standing.
== History ==

Bronze Age burials and barrows have been found in Scopwick. There is evidence of a Roman settlement (coins, pottery, burials and a dwelling). A Saxon coin found in the village depicts Offa and has been dated to 757–796 AD.

The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Scapeuic/Scapewic.

==Geography and ecology==

A limestone stream runs through the village toward Kirkby Green and terminates near the railway. Wildlife on the stream includes moorhen, mallard, water mint and hart&#x27;s tongue fern. Around Scopwick Hall there is a small deciduous woodland. To the northwest of the village is a quarry.

<doc id="211244" wikidata="Q714496" url="?curid=211244" title="Larry Clark">
<text>Lawrence Donald Clark (born January 19, 1943) is an American film director, photographer, writer and film producer who is best known for his controversial teen film &quot;Kids&quot; (1995) and his photography book &quot;Tulsa&quot; (1971). His work focuses primarily on youth who casually engage in illegal drug use, underage sex, and violence, and who are part of a specific subculture, such as surfing, punk rock, or skateboarding.

==Early life==
Clark was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He learned photography at an early age. His mother was an itinerant baby photographer, and he was enlisted in the family business from the age of 14. His father was a traveling sales manager for the Reader Service Bureau, selling books and magazines door-to-door, and was rarely home. In 1959, Clark began injecting amphetamines with his friends.

Clark attended the Layton School of Art in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he studied under Walter Sheffer and Gerhard Bakker.

==Career==
In 1964, he moved to New York City to freelance, but was drafted within two months into the United States Army. From 1964 to 1965, he served in the Vietnam War in a unit that supplied ammunition to units fighting in the north. His experiences there led him to publish the 1971 book &quot;Tulsa&quot;, a photo documentary illustrating his young friends&#x27; drug use in black and white.

Routinely carrying a camera, from 1963 to 1971 Clark produced pictures of his drug-shooting coterie that have been described by critics as &quot;exposing the reality of American suburban life at the fringe and ... shattering long-held mythical conventions that drugs and violence were an experience solely indicative of the urban landscape.&quot;

His follow-up was &quot;Teenage Lust&quot; (1983), an &quot;autobiography&quot; of his teen past through the images of others. It included his family photos, more teenage drug use, graphic pictures of teenage sexual activity, and young male hustlers in Times Square, New York City. Clark constructed a photographic essay titled &quot;The Perfect Childhood&quot; that examined the effect of media in youth culture. His photographs are part of public collections at several art museums including the Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Photographic Arts, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

In 1993, Clark directed Chris Isaak&#x27;s music video &quot;Solitary Man&quot;. This experience developed into an interest in film direction. After publishing other photographic collections, Clark met Harmony Korine in New York City and asked Korine to write the screenplay for his first feature film &quot;Kids&quot;, which was released to controversy and mixed critical reception in 1995. Clark continued directing, filming a handful of additional independent feature films in the several years after this.

In 2001, Clark shot three features — &quot;Bully&quot;, &quot;Ken Park&quot; and &quot;Teenage Caveman&quot; — over a span of nine months. As of 2017, they are his last films to feature professional actors.

In 2002, Clark spent several hours in a police cell after punching and trying to strangle Hamish McAlpine, the head of Metro Tartan, the UK distributor for &quot;Ken Park&quot;. According to McAlpine, who was left with a broken nose, the incident arose from an argument about Israel and the Middle East, and he claims that he did not provoke Clark.

In a 2016 interview, Clark discussed his lifelong struggle with drug abuse, although stating he maintained total sobriety while filmmaking. He confessed that the only exception made to his practice of abstinence while filming was &quot;Marfa Girl&quot;. Clark explained that while filming that movie he used opiates for pain due to double knee replacement surgery.

==Films==
===&quot;Kids&quot;===

In &quot;Kids&quot; (1995), his most widely known film, boys portrayed as being as young as 12 are shown to be casually drinking alcohol and using other drugs. The film received an NC-17 rating, and was later released without a rating when Disney bought Miramax.

===Other work===
&quot;Ken Park&quot; is a more sexually and violently graphic film than &quot;Kids&quot;, including a scene of auto-erotic asphyxiation and ejaculation by an emotionally rattled high-school boy (portrayed by James Ransone, then in his early 20s). 

In Australia, &quot;Ken Park&quot; was banned for its graphic sexual content and a protest screening held in response was immediately shut down by the police. Australian film critic Margaret Pomeranz, co-host of &quot;At the Movies&quot;, was almost arrested for screening the film at a hall. The film was not released in the United States, but Clark says that it was because of the producer&#x27;s failure to get releases for the music used.

In 2015, Clark collaborated alongside notable skateboard and clothing brand, Supreme, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of &quot;Kids&quot; with a collection of decks, T-shirts, and sweatshirts that feature stills from the iconic film. The collection was released on May 21, 2015, in Supreme&#x27;s New York, Los Angeles, and London locations and on May 23 in its Japan location. 

Clark has won the top prizes at the Cognac Festival du Film Policier (for &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot;), the Stockholm Film Festival (for &quot;Bully&quot;) and the Rome Film Festival (for &quot;Marfa Girl&quot;). He has also competed for the Golden Palm (&quot;Kids&quot;) and Golden Lion (&quot;Bully&quot;).

<text>Gordon Bunshaft (May 9, 1909 – August 6, 1990) was an American architect, a leading proponent of modern design in the mid-twentieth century. A partner in Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM), Bunshaft joined the firm in 1937 and remained with it for more than 40 years. His notable buildings include Lever House in New York, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., the National Commercial Bank in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 140 Broadway (Marine Midland Grace Trust Co.), and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Branch Bank in New York. (The last was the first post-war &quot;transparent&quot; bank on the East Coast.)

==Early life==
Bunshaft was born in Buffalo, New York, to Russian Jewish immigrant parents and attended Lafayette High School. A sickly child, he &quot;frequently drew while in bed,&quot; his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary notes. &quot;A doctor who admired his pictures of houses told his mother that her son should become an architect.&quot; He received both his undergraduate (1933) and his master&#x27;s (1935) degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then studied in Europe from 1935 to 1937 on a Rotch Traveling Scholarship and the MIT Honorary Traveling Fellowship.

==Career==

After his traveling scholarships, Bunshaft worked briefly for Edward Durell Stone and the influential industrial designer Raymond Loewy. Reflecting on his brief stint (&quot;about two or three months&quot;) with Loewy, Bunshaft told an interviewer for the Chicago Architects Oral History Project, &quot;I didn’t like it there. Raymond Loewy was a phony. He’d put a gold line on a cigarette or on a railroad train, and he’d get a fee for it.&quot;
In 1937, he joined Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill [SOM], where he remained for 42 years (with a hiatus for his service in the Army Corps of Engineers during World War II) until he retired in 1979. Bunshaft&#x27;s early influences included Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier. &quot;Mies was the Mondrian of architecture, and Le Corbusier was the Picasso,&quot; he told the Oral History interviewer.

After World War II, Bunshaft recalled, the cultural climate was well suited to his Miesian/Corbusian vision:

&quot;So in 1947, here you had these young men ready to go—a lot of them ready, a lot of them just getting into offices—and you had this boom of clients wanting to build buildings. It was easily more of a Golden Age than the Italian Renaissance with the Medicis. When I say clients, they were mostly corporations. The heads of them were men who wanted to build something that they’d be proud to have representing their company, whether it was a bank or whatever. In the corporations in those days, the head man was personally involved and personally building himself a palace for his people that would not only represent his company, but his personal pleasure. They were the new Medicis, and there were many of them. [T]hese people never questioned doing a modern building. They accepted modern architecture. ... I think the reason for that is that they wanted their company to be progressive.

First and foremost among the iconic modernist buildings he designed while at SOM is the renowned Lever House. Completed in 1952, it was New York’s &quot;first major commercial structure with a glass curtain-wall (only the United Nations Secretariat preceded it),&quot; notes the architecture critic Paul Goldberger, &quot;and it burst onto the stuffy, solid masonry wall of Park Avenue like a vision of a new world.”

Other memorable buildings by Bunshaft include the Manufacturers Trust Company Building (1954), the first bank building in the United States to be built in the International Style; the Pepsi-Cola Building (now 500 Park Avenue), completed in 1959; the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, completed in 1963; 140 Broadway (formerly known as the Marine Midland Building), topped out in 1966; the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum in Austin, Texas (1971); the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. (1974); and the National Commercial Bank in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (1983).

In an interview for the Chicago Architects Oral History Project, Bunshaft reflected on the Beinecke. &quot;I happen to love books, especially bindings and things, and I thought it ought to be a treasure house and it ought to express that by having a large number of beautiful books displayed behind glass,&quot; he told Betty J. Blum in 1990.

&quot;The structure would be covered with onyx and these big panels would be translucent onyx. It came from my seeing what I thought was onyx in a Renaissance-type palace in Istanbul. … The whole idea of onyx…is because books cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. … [Onyx] admits soft light, but no sunlight, so it’s like being in a cathedral. In ancient times, they used two materials, onyx and alabaster, for small windows. [&quot;When onyx of sufficient quality proved impossible to acquire, Bunshaft compromised on a stratum of white marble “that was translucent.”&quot;] When the sun pours in, it’s quite nice with the rich books.&quot;

Bunshaft&#x27;s only single-family residence was his own, the 2300-square-foot (210 m2) Travertine House. On his death, he left the house to MoMA, which sold it to Martha Stewart in 1995. Her extensive remodelling stalled amid an acrimonious planning dispute with a neighbour. In 2005, she sold the house to textile magnate Donald Maharam, who described the house as &quot;decrepit and largely beyond repair&quot; and demolished it. The architectural historian Nicholas Adams, author of &quot;Gordon Bunshaft and SOM: Building Corporate Modernism&quot;, has lamented the demolition of the Bunshaft house as &quot;the greatest loss&quot; of all the architect&#x27;s projects that have succumbed to the wrecking ball. &quot;[He] and his wife Nina ... never had children and so their home was not designed for a family so much as it was for art,&quot; said Adams, in a 2019 interview. &quot;It had his Miròs, Picassos, Moores, and Dubuffets and was surrounded by a remarkable landscape created by [Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill’s] Joanna Diman.&quot;

===Awards and honors===
Bunshaft was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters and was the recipient of numerous other honors and awards. In 1955, he received the Brunner Prize of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters and, in 1984, its gold medal. He also received the American Institute of Architects Twenty-five Year Award for Lever House in 1980 and in 1988 the Pritzker Architecture Prize. In 1958, he was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate and became a full member in 1959. From 1963 to 1972, he was a member of the Commission of Fine Arts in Washington, D.C.

Upon receiving the Pritzker Prize in 1988, for which he had nominated himself, the famously terse architect gave the shortest speech of any winner in the award&#x27;s history:
In 1928, I entered the MIT School of Architecture and started my architectural trip. Today, 60 years later, I&#x27;ve been given the Pritzker Architecture Prize for which I thank the Pritzker family and the distinguished members of the selection committee for honoring me with this prestigious award. It is the capstone of my life in architecture. That&#x27;s it.
Bunshaft was a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art. He also received the Medal of Honor of the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects.

==Style==


Bunshaft&#x27;s biography page on the Pritzker Prize website lauds the architect for &quot;opening a whole new era of skyscraper design with his first major design project in 1952, the 24-story Lever House in New York.&quot;

&quot;Many consider it the keystone of establishing the International Style as corporate America&#x27;s standard in architecture, at least through the 1970s. In recent years, it has been declared a historic landmark, New York&#x27;s most contemporary structure to hold that distinction. The late Lewis Mumford described Lever House...in glowing terms, &#x27;It says all that can be said, delicately, accurately, elegantly, with surfaces of glass, with ribs of steel...an impeccable achievement.&#x27;&quot;

Throughout the 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s, his style became more sculptural, such as Yale&#x27;s Beinecke Library:

&quot;The interior is as much like a religious building as like a library. [I]n buildings like the travertine-clad Johnson Library, Mr. Bunshaft seemed to be striving even harder for effect, and the result seemed more like a mausoleum. But he closed his career with a final skyscraper, a 27-story triangular office tower of travertine for the National Commercial Bank in Jeddah with huge loggias that he called &#x27;gardens in the air.&#x27; It was an aggressively sculptural but brilliantly inventive project that ended Mr. Bunshaft&#x27;s active years on a note of high creativity.&quot;

A staunch modernist to the end, he was implacably hostile to postmodern architecture, which he regarded as flouting the timeless laws of logic and proportion that in his view governed all architecture, ancient and modern alike, while at the same time indulging &quot;arbitrary whimsy&quot; rather than responding to its times:

&quot;[B]ehind it all [&quot;i.e., all architecture&quot;] is logic. That’s why, in my opinion, postmodern junk that’s being built is a joke. It’s arbitrary and hasn’t a damn thing to do with our times. It’s an insult to history, because the people who do this postmodern stuff don’t really know [history]. … [T]here’s no rationale for it. All great architecture through all history from Persia to Egypt to anyplace, the great structures are all logical for their use and for the structural method and for their materials. There’s no arbitrary whimsy. ... What makes a guy get up one morning and suddenly decide to do Italiano columns and stuff in a plaza in New Orleans?&quot;

Bunshaft&#x27;s personal papers are held by the Department of Drawings &amp; Archives in the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University; his architectural drawings remain with SOM.

==Personal life==
In 1943, Bunshaft married Nina Wayler (d. 1994). Avid collectors of contemporary art, the couple owned many major pieces, including works by Joan Miró, Dubuffet, Giacometti, Léger and Noguchi. They lived in the Manhattan House Apartments on New York&#x27;s Upper East Side, which Bunshaft helped design, and at the Travertine House in East Hampton. He died of cardiovascular arrest in 1990, at the age of 81, and is buried next to his wife and parents in the Temple Beth El cemetery on Pine Ridge Road in Cheektowaga, New York.

Nicholas Adams, the architectural historian and author of &quot;Gordon Bunshaft and SOM: Building Corporate Modernism&quot;, characterizes Bunshaft as &quot;gruff, grumpy, crude, and stubborn,&quot; noting, &quot;When pressed about his architecture, he offered staccato descriptive explanations. At dinner parties he would turn his back (and rotate his chair) so that he wouldn’t have to talk to an unappealing neighbor. &#x27;I suppose you do that postmodernist shit,&#x27; he reportedly told a young employee recently moved to SOM’s New York office from Washington, D.C. He joked that the only reason his name was not on the masthead at SOM was that the initials would be S.O.B.&quot;

Yet Adams discovered, in Bunshaft&#x27;s private correspondence with artists whose work he admired, another, more vulnerable side of the man, poles apart from his legendary brusqueness. &quot;His extensive correspondence with [ Henry Moore and Jean Dubuffet ], preserved at the Avery Library, is both playful and witty, describing cheerful conversations, and looking forward to further jovial meetings,&quot; says Adams. &quot;In November 1972, he wrote tenderly to Dubuffet after the installation of his Group of Three Trees in front of Chase Manhattan in New York: &#x27;I enjoyed your visit here tremendously. I felt that although I have known you, off and on, for many years, this is the first time we really became closer.&#x27;&quot;
A man of few words, he famously said he wanted his buildings to speak for themselves.

<text>John James &quot;Jean&quot; Charest (; born June 24, 1958) is a Canadian lawyer and former politician who served as the 29th premier of Quebec from 2003 to 2012. Prior to that, he was a member of Parliament (MP) between 1984 and 1998. After holding several Cabinet posts from 1986 to 1990 and from 1991 to 1993, he was the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada from 1993 to 1998.

Born in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Charest worked as a lawyer before becoming an MP following the 1984 federal election. In 1986 he joined Brian Mulroney&#x27;s government as a minister of state, but resigned from cabinet in 1990 after improperly speaking to a judge about an active court case. He returned to cabinet in 1991 as the minister of the environment. Charest ran to succeed Mulroney as party leader and prime minister in the PCs&#x27; 1993 leadership election, but placed second to Kim Campbell. Charest served as Campbell&#x27;s industry minister and deputy prime minister. After the PCs&#x27; defeat in the 1993 election, Charest succeeded Campbell as party leader. He led the PCs to a minor recovery in the 1997 election.

Charest left federal politics in 1998 and was elected to lead the Quebec Liberal Party, the province&#x27;s main federalist political party. He became premier of Quebec after the Liberals won the 2003 provincial election. He won two more elections until he lost the 2012 election to the sovereigntist Parti Quebecois (PQ) and resigned as premier. After politics, Charest worked as a consultant, including for Huawei on the Meng Wanzhou case and for its 5G network plans in Canada, and joined McCarthy Tétrault LLP as a partner. Charest was a candidate in the 2022 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, finishing a distant second to Pierre Poilievre.

==Early life and education==
Charest was born on June 24, 1958, in Sherbrooke, in Quebec&#x27;s Eastern Townships. His parents are Rita (), an Irish Quebecer, and Claude &quot;Red&quot; Charest, a French Canadian. He obtained a law degree from the Université de Sherbrooke and was admitted to the Barreau du Québec in 1981. He is married to Michèle Dionne (since June 21, 1980), and they have three children, Amélie, Antoine, and Alexandra.

Charest is fully bilingual in French and English. In the 1980 Quebec referendum, he failed to vote because he was getting married.

==Federal politics (1984–1998)==
Charest worked as a lawyer until he was elected Progressive Conservative member of the Parliament of Canada for the riding (electoral district) of Sherbrooke in the 1984 election. From 1984 to 1986, Charest served as Assistant Deputy Chair of Committees of the Whole of the House of Commons.

=== Minister of state (1986–1990) ===
In 1986, at age 28, Charest was appointed to the Cabinet of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney as minister of state (youth). He was the youngest cabinet minister in Canadian history.

Charest was appointed minister of state (fitness and amateur sport) in 1988, but had to resign from cabinet in 1990 after improperly speaking to a judge about a case regarding the Canadian Track and Field Association.

=== Role in Meech Lake Accord (1990–1991) ===

Charest was involved in the proposal of the Meech Lake Accord (which failed to be ratified in June 1990) which would have given the province of Quebec the status of a &quot;distinct society&quot;, extend provincial powers, and extensively change the constitution. In 1990, he led a commission that recommended a companion accord that would address the concerns of other provinces, assert that the distinct society clause would be subject to the &quot;Charter&quot;, and would feature greater protections for minority language rights in the provinces. The recommendations caused Mulroney&#x27;s environment minister and Quebec lieutenant, Lucien Bouchard, to view the companion accord as a betrayal of Meech. Bouchard later resigned from Cabinet and founded the Bloc Québécois, a pro-sovereigntist party.

=== Minister of the environment (1991–1993) ===

Charest returned to cabinet as minister of the environment in 1991. In that role, he led the Canadian delegation at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

=== 1993 PC leadership bid ===
When Mulroney announced his retirement as PC leader and prime minister, Charest was a candidate for the leadership of the party at the 1993 Progressive Conservative leadership convention.

Karlheinz Schreiber alleged he gave $30,000 in cash to Charest&#x27;s campaign for the Tory leadership in 1993. However Charest himself says it was only $10,000 although federal leadership election rules permitted such cash donations. As of 2007, rules against such donations for provincial party leadership campaigns still do not exist in Québec.

Charest placed a strong second to Defence Minister Kim Campbell, who had held a large lead going into the convention. Charest served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry, Science and Technology in Campbell&#x27;s short-lived cabinet.

=== PC Party leader (1993–1998) ===

In the 1993 election, the PCs suffered the worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level. Only two of the party&#x27;s 295 candidates were elected, Charest and Elsie Wayne. Charest himself was re-elected fairly handily in Sherbrooke, taking 56 per cent of the vote. As the only surviving member of what turned out to be the last PC Cabinet, Charest was appointed interim party leader and confirmed in the post in April 1995. Charest, therefore, became the first person of francophone descent to lead the Progressive Conservative Party.

Charest participated in the 1994 class of the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Global Leaders for Tomorrow program.

During the 1995 referendum on Quebec&#x27;s sovereignty, Charest was vice-president of the &quot;No&quot; campaign (Comité national des Québécoises et des Québécois pour le NON).

In the 1997 federal election, Charest campaigned on securing national unity in Canada by recognizing Quebec as being a distinct society within Canada, along with the proposal of a &quot;New Covenant&quot; for Canadian confederation to be negotiated between the federal and provincial governments. Charest and the PCs benefited from rapidly rising in popularity amongst all language groups in Quebec, where voters were found to have preferred Charest over Gilles Duceppe, the leader of the Bloc Québécois. In the election, the Tories received 18.8 per cent of the popular vote and won 20 seats, mostly in Atlantic Canada. Although the party&#x27;s seat count had recovered (as they won only two seats in 1993), Charest considered the result a disappointment. While the Tories finished only half a point behind Reform in terms of the popular vote, their support was too dispersed west of Quebec to translate into seats. They were also hampered by vote-splitting with Reform in rural central Ontario, a traditional Tory stronghold where Reform had made significant inroads.

==Early provincial political career (1998–2003)==
In April 1998, Charest gave in to considerable public and political pressure, especially among business circles, to leave federal politics and become leader of the Quebec Liberal Party. Charest was considered by many to be the best hope for the federalist QLP to defeat the sovereigntist Parti Québécois government.

In the 1998 election, the Quebec Liberals received more votes than the PQ, but because the Liberal vote was concentrated in fewer ridings, the PQ won enough seats to form another majority government. Charest won his own riding of Sherbrooke with a majority of 907 votes.

In the April 2003 election, Charest led the Quebec Liberals to a majority, ending nine years of PQ rule. He declared he had a mandate to reform health care, cut taxes, reduce spending and reduce the size of government. Charest&#x27;s Liberals won 76 seats, forming a majority government, and won his own riding of Sherbrooke with a majority of 2,597 votes.

==Premier of Quebec (2003–2012)==

===Economic policy===

Charest increased the Quebec sales tax (QST) thrice. In 2011, his government raised the rate from 7.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent before raising it to 9.5 per cent in 2012. The third and last hike came into effect in 2013, with the rate rising to 9.975 per cent.

In October 2007, Quebec became the first province in Canada to implement a carbon tax. At the time it was implemented, the tax amounted to 0.8 cents per litre of gas and 0.9 cents per litre of diesel fuel.

Much of the fiscal policy of the Charest government was based upon the expectation that new revenues could be obtained from a resolution of the fiscal imbalance believed to exist between the federal and provincial governments. The Harper government was widely expected to address this issue through increased equalization payments, while falling short of Quebec&#x27;s overall demands.

==== Plan Nord ====

In May 2011, Charest&#x27;s government launched the Plan Nord, an economic development strategy to develop the natural resources extraction sector in the part of Quebec to the north of the 49th parallel. The plan, to be carried out over 25 years, would foster over C$80 billion in energy, mining, and forestry investments and create or consolidate 20,000 jobs a year for the duration. The proposed plan, described as &quot;a potential centrepiece&quot; of Charest&#x27;s political legacy, received the full support of the mining industry, the Crees and Inuit representatives but was met with scepticism and downright opposition by the Innus and most environmentalists.

===Environmental policy===

Charest also attempted to distinguish himself on the issue of the environment. His vocal opposition to the federal decision to opt out of the Kyoto Accord, and his insistence that Quebec would seek to meet its own Kyoto targets has earned him considerable support. His government set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, petroleum royalties, and a 2011-2020 Action Plan for Electric Vehicles. He also established the Sustainable Development Act, which adds to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms the right for every person to live in a healthful environment in which biodiversity is preserved. In 2012, Charest was awarded the Fray International Sustainability Award for his work and advocacy towards sustainable development in politics.

===Other policy===

In the 2003 election, Charest had promised to allow the cities that had been forcibly merged by the Parti Québécois government to hold referendums which would allow to demerge and return to their previous situation. This promise was seen as key to his victory in many ridings, such as those in the suburbs around Longueuil and Quebec City and the continued support of the Anglophone community in the West Island of Montreal. In office, however, Charest retreated from his promise. Municipalities were allowed to hold demerger referendums if at least 10 per cent of the electorate signed a petition calling for them, and only if more than 35 per cent participated in the voting process. In some former municipalities, such as Saint Laurent on the Island of Montreal, the turnout of the vote was of 75.2 per cent in favour of a demerger, but it was invalidated because the voter turnout was just 28.6 per cent.

The demerger process also resulted in the restructuring of the existing megacities, with both these and the demerged cities handing over massive powers over taxation and local services to the new &quot;agglomeration councils&quot;. The makeup of these councils was based on the population of the municipalities involved, with the mayors having the right to unilaterally appoint all of the individuals who would represent their cities on the council. The resulting structure was seen by many to be less democratic than the one which had preceded it, as demerged municipalities were denied an effective voice, and the city councils of the major cities were substantially weakened by the power of the mayors to go over the heads of opposition councillors and exercise power through their appointees to the agglomeration body.

During his mandate as Premier, Charest made some efforts to expand the place of Québec in the international community. The province was granted representation at UNESCO, the cultural branch of the United Nations. Charest also voiced some support for the Calgary Declaration (1997), which recognized Quebec as &quot;unique.&quot;

During the debate in the Parliament of Canada over recognizing Quebec as a nation within Canada, Charest stated that Quebec was a &quot;nation&quot; no matter what other parts of Canada said—that this was not up to anyone else to define.

===2012 student protests===
In 2011, the Charest government decided to increase the tuition fees in all Quebec universities. Three major student unions began to organise demonstrations in Montreal and in Quebec City. In March 2012, many CEGEPs and universities voted for a student strike. The government faced major challenges when students demonstrated and went on strike by boycotting classes to protest planned tuition increases. Every month large demonstrations took place in several cities across Quebec. The Premier and his government were accused by some, including the students unions, the PQ and Québec Solidaire of being too hard. On May 4, 2012, the Quebec Liberal Party held a party conference in Victoriaville and a student demonstration was suppressed by Sûreté du Québec police. On May 14, 2012, then Deputy Premier and Education minister, Line Beauchamp resigned and Michelle Courchesne was appointed Deputy Premier and Minister of Education. The government passed Bill 78 to impose restrictions on protests; this caused controversy, with the Barreau du Québec, among others, expressing concern about possible infringement of constitutional rights. Bill 78 was revoked by the Pauline Marois government.

===Controversies===

On December 6, 2007, the Opposition urged Charest to testify to the House of Commons of Canada Ethics Committee in its investigation of Karlheinz Schreiber. Schreiber told the committee he paid $30,000 in cash to Charest&#x27;s brother to help fund Charest&#x27;s 1993 leadership bid for the federal Progressive Conservative party.

Charest&#x27;s third term was marked by several allegations of questionable financing from the Quebec Liberal Party as well as a multitude of scandals in the construction sector in Quebec, the loss of $39.8 billion from the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, and the Marc Bellemare (Charest&#x27;s former justice minister) affair. Bellemare alleged in 2010 that he had been pressured by Quebec Liberal fundraisers during the appointment of judges in 2003. In response, the Charest government created the Bastarache commission, where Charest testified in defence. Charest however refused to launch a public inquiry into the collusion and financing of political parties and corruption in the construction industry, despite a 2011 survey indicating that 77 per cent of Quebecers demanded such an inquiry. Charest finally launched an inquiry in 2012 through the creation of the Charbonneau commission in response to rising discontent within the Quebec Liberal caucus.

=== Elections ===

====2007 Quebec election====
The Charest government was deeply unpopular during its first years in office, enjoying a public approval rating of below 50 per cent in most opinion polls and falling to the low twenties in voter support. In the first few weeks after André Boisclair was elected leader of the PQ, polls showed that Charest and the Liberals would be roundly defeated in the next election. Boisclair did not perform well as Leader of the Opposition, and Charest&#x27;s numbers recovered somewhat. A poll conducted by Léger Marketing for &quot;Le Devoir&quot; placed the Liberals at 34 per cent against 32 per cent for the PQ and 24 per cent for the ADQ, with Charest obtaining a higher personal approval rating than the PQ leader. Liberal support, however remained heavily concentrated in Anglophone and Allophone ridings in the west of Montreal, meaning that the increase in support would not necessarily translate into seats.

On February 21, 2007, Charest asked the Lieutenant-Governor to dissolve the National Assembly and call an election on March 26, 2007. Charest conducted an extraordinary session the day before with Finance Minister Michel Audet delivering the 2007 budget.

Prior to his call for an election, Charest revealed his platform which included income tax cuts of about $250 million. In the last week of the campaign, Charest promised an additional $700 million in tax cuts—some of it coming for the additional equalization money from the 2007 federal budget; reduction of hospital wait times; improvement and increase of French courses at school; an increase of the number of daycare spaces; and an increase in tuition fees for university students ($50 per semester until 2012). The last measure was met with criticism from students&#x27; associations, and a more-radical student association, the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (formerly known as the CASSEE) had also considered a strike.

Charest won a minority government in the election, and held onto his own seat. On election night, early numbers had shown Charest losing his seat of Sherbrooke to his PQ opponent; however, this situation was reversed once it became apparent that the advanced poll ballot boxes which heavily favoured Charest had not yet been counted. The resulting minority government was the first since 1878 when Charles Boucher de Boucherville was Premier.

====2008 Quebec election====

In November 2008, arguing that Quebecers needed a majority government during difficult economic times, Charest called a snap election for December 8. His party captured a historic third consecutive term as he brought the Liberals back to majority governance. It was the first time a party had won a third consecutive term in Quebec since the Quiet Revolution.

====2012 Quebec election====
On August 1, 2012, Charest launched his electoral campaign for the 2012 Quebec general election from the Quebec Jean-Lesage International Airport with the slogan &quot;For Quebec&quot;. The QLP focused its campaign on the issues of respect of the law and civil order, referencing the demonstrations of the previous months. They claimed to be the party of the silent majority who did not support the student protest movement. It was the first provincial election in Quebec to feature the newly formed CAQ party led by François Legault on the ballot. On the night of September 4, Charest and his party lost the general election. The result was a hung parliament, with the Parti Québécois of Pauline Marois being the party with the most seats (54). The Quebec Liberal Party became the official opposition with 50 seats. Charest lost his own seat of Sherbrooke in the Eastern Townships, a seat that he had held since 1984, both in the federal and provincial legislatures. Charest announced on September 5 in Quebec City that he would resign as Quebec Liberal Party leader.

==Post-premiership==
Charest was formerly a consultant for Huawei and helped support and advise Huawei for its participation for 5G network plans in Canada and to be a partner with McCarthy Tétrault LLP. Charest also claims he helped with the Meng Wanzhou case.

After turning 65 in June 2023, Charest reached the mandatory retirement age for equity partners at McCarthy Tétrault. While the law firm offered to keep him on a counsel role, Charest refused. In January 2024, Charest decided to leave McCarthy Tétrault and joined the Therrien Couture Joli-Cœur group.

===2022 Conservative leadership bid===
On March 9, 2022, Charest announced that he would be a candidate for the 2022 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election. He had previously considered running in the 2020 leadership election, though he ultimately decided not to.

With 16 per cent of the points, Charest finished a distant second to winner Pierre Poilievre, who took 68 per cent of points on the first ballot.

<doc id="211255" wikidata="Q1128899" url="?curid=211255" title="Gish">
<text>Gish is the debut studio album by the American alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins, released on May 28, 1991, by Caroline Records. The album was produced by Butch Vig and frontman Billy Corgan, with the latter describing &quot;Gish&quot; as a &quot;very spiritual album&quot; and &quot;an album about spiritual ascension&quot;.

Despite initially peaking at only number 195 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 upon its release, &quot;Gish&quot; received critical acclaim, with particular praise directed at the band&#x27;s distinctive psychedelic sound. The album was eventually certified platinum (at least one million copies shipped in the US) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), becoming one of the best-selling independent albums at the time. It has since been ranked by multiple publications as one of the best rock albums of the 1990s, with &quot;Pitchfork&quot; deeming &quot;without &quot;Gish&quot;, there would probably be no &quot;Nevermind&quot; as we know it.&quot;

==Music and composition==
Musically, &quot;Gish&quot; has been described as featuring alternative rock, hard rock, psychedelic rock, grunge, dream pop, stoner rock, college rock, psychedelia, art rock, and heavy metal. As a writer, Billy Corgan wanted to find the balance between classic rock of bands playing heavy riffs like Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, and the sensuality and grace of alternative bands like the Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and My Bloody Valentine. &quot;For us, it was trying to become this balance point between what felt like dumb riff rock and then the stuff we were really attracted to coming out of the U.K. And then we put those pieces together with the Beatles somewhere in the middle&quot;. A song like &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; reflected that balance and what Corgan wanted to achieve: &quot;we could be beautiful, pretty, psychedelic, and then flip the switch and be heavy and play a ripping lead.&quot; When composing the songs, Corgan was experimenting taking LSD to get a psychedelic feeling: &quot;LSD gave me the confidence to attempt these things on kind of a weird tightrope wire act&quot;.

== Recording ==
&quot;Gish&quot; was recorded from December 1990 to March 1991 in Butch Vig&#x27;s Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, with a budget of $20,000. Vig and Corgan worked together as co-producers. At the time, Vig was still a relatively unknown producer. The longer recording period and larger budget were unprecedented for Vig, who later recalled:
(Corgan) wanted to make everything sound amazing and see how far he could take it; really spend time on the production and the performances. For me that was a godsend because I was used to doing records for all the indie labels and we only had budgets for three or four days. Having that luxury to spend hours on a guitar tone or tuning the drums or working on harmonies and textural things... I was over the moon to think I had found a comrade-in-arms who wanted to push me, and who really wanted me to push him.

The inclusion of a massive production style reminiscent of ELO and Queen was unusual for an independent band at the time. Whereas many albums at the time used drum sampling and processing, &quot;Gish&quot; used unprocessed drum recordings, and an exacting, unique guitar sound. Corgan also performed nearly all of the guitar and bass parts on the record, which was confirmed by Vig in a later interview.

The album&#x27;s sessions, lasting 30 working days, were brisk by Pumpkins&#x27; standards, largely because of the group&#x27;s inexperience. The majority of D&#x27;arcy Wretzky&#x27;s bass lines and James Iha&#x27;s guitar parts were re-recorded by Corgan using their instruments. The recording sessions put an intense strain on the band, with Wretzky later commenting that she did not know how the band survived it, and Corgan asserting he suffered a nervous breakdown.

Regarding the album&#x27;s thematic content, Corgan would later say,
The album is about pain and spiritual ascension. People ask if it&#x27;s a political album. It&#x27;s not a political album, it&#x27;s a personal album. In a weird kind of way, &quot;Gish&quot; is almost like an instrumental album—it just happens to have singing on it, but the music overpowers the band in a lot of places. I was trying to say a lot of things I couldn&#x27;t really say in kind of intangible, unspeakable ways, so I was capable of doing that with the music, but I don&#x27;t think I was capable of doing it with words.

== Title ==
The album was named after silent film icon Lillian Gish. In an interview, Corgan said, &quot;My grandmother used to tell me that one of the biggest things that ever happened was when Lillian Gish rode through town on a train, my grandmother lived in the middle of nowhere, so that was a big deal ...&quot; Later, Corgan joked that the album was originally going to be called &quot;Fish&quot;, but was changed to &quot;Gish&quot; to avoid comparisons to jam band Phish.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Gish&quot; was met with largely enthusiastic reviews. On the month of its release, Chris Heim of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; credited producer Butch Vig for helping the band achieve a &quot;clearly defined&quot; and &quot;big, bold, punchy&quot; sound for the album. Heim also indicated that the varied styles of the album would be a good addition to the alternative music culture of Chicago at the time—a culture that was sometimes perceived as inaccessible for new bands. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; picked up on the eclectic mix of musical style on &quot;Gish&quot; as well, complementing its &quot;pummeling hard rock&quot;, &quot;gentle interludes&quot;, and &quot;psychedelic crescendos&quot;. In an end-of-year recap of 1991 releases, Heim noted that the album constituted a &quot;smashing local success story&quot; for the Chicago area. Greg Kot, also of the &quot;Tribune&quot;, called &quot;Gish&quot; &quot;perhaps the most audacious and accomplished&quot; of all 1991 albums released by local bands; in an article later that year, Kot listed the album among the best of 1991. Chris Mundy of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;awe-inspiring&quot; with &quot;meticulously calculated chaos&quot; and a &quot;swirling energy&quot;.

Many substantive reviews of &quot;Gish&quot; emerged only with the 1993 release of &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, when mainstream critics took their first look into the back-catalog of a band whose popularity was exploding. Derek Weiler of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; noted that songs on &quot;Gish&quot; contained &quot;either galloping riffs or trippy feedback hazes&quot; and that the latter were especially effective and entertaining.

In 1992, &quot;Gish&quot; and the Smashing Pumpkins earned recognition at the Chicago Musician Awards, for which local music publication &quot;Illinois Entertainer&quot; polled readers and Chicago music industry figures such as critics, writers, and club owners. In separate polls, readers and industry figures chose &quot;Gish&quot; as the &quot;best local album&quot;. Jimmy Chamberlin and James Iha won individual honors for their performances on the album, and the band as a whole earned the &quot;best hometown national act&quot; award.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Gish&quot; spent one week on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number 195 (later re-peaking at number 146 upon its 2011 re-release); however, the album reached number one on the &quot;College Music Journal&quot; chart, which tracks airplay and popularity on college radio stations. It also had a six-week run on the New Zealand Albums Chart, peaking at number 40. Despite an inauspicious start, the album sold 100,000 copies in less than a year, far exceeding the expectations of indie label Caroline Records, a subsidiary of Virgin Records. In the US, the album was certified gold by RIAA on March 14, 1994. Until the release of the Offspring album &quot;Smash&quot; in 1994, &quot;Gish&quot; was the highest-selling independently released album of all time. &quot;Gish&quot; would later be reissued under the Virgin label, and was certified platinum in the US on February 5, 1999.

== Release history ==
The first mastering of &quot;Gish&quot; on CD was from Digital Audio Tape and appeared on Caroline Records, a subsidiary of Virgin Records. In 1994, after the success of follow-up &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, the album was given a slight remaster and redesign and was reissued on the Virgin label. Both editions credit Howie Weinberg as mastering engineer. In 2008, the Smashing Pumpkins announced a 17th anniversary box set re-release of the album that would include older bonus material, but this set experienced delays. After finally negotiating the rights, &quot;Gish&quot; was re-issued in November 2011, being remastered on CD and Vinyl with extra tracks and packaging.

<doc id="211256" wikidata="Q2552079" url="?curid=211256" title="Tara Maclay">
<text>Tara Maclay is a fictional character created for the action-horror/fantasy television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003). She was developed by Joss Whedon and portrayed by Amber Benson. Tara is a shy young woman with magical talents who falls in love with Willow Rosenberg, one of the core characters. Together, they help Buffy Summers, who has been given superhuman powers, to defeat evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale.

Willow was a popular character when Tara was introduced, and the onset of their relationship was met with some resistance from fans. Tara grows from a reserved girl who is unsure of herself to being the moral center of Buffy&#x27;s circle of friends, named the Scooby Gang. Her relationship with Willow is consistently positive, and the first recurring depiction of a lesbian couple on prime time network series television in the United States. Tara is killed by a stray gunshot toward the end of the sixth season, causing Willow to go on a rampage. Series writers and producers received angry protests from some fans when Tara was killed. Whedon upheld that it was the necessary course to take to propel Willow&#x27;s story arc further; both the show&#x27;s producers and Amber Benson deny that there was any malicious intent behind the decision. Tara was included in AfterEllen.com&#x27;s Top 50 Lesbian and Bisexual Characters, ranking at No. 15.

==Creation and casting==

Tara is introduced in the fourth season episode &quot;Hush&quot; as a college student who attends a Wicca meeting where Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) goes to find some like-minded people. Tara is hesitant to speak out during the meeting and has a pronounced stammer that returns throughout the series when she is upset. She reacts positively during the meeting to Willow&#x27;s suggestion that the Wiccan group discuss spellcasting, but the rest of the group scoff at the suggestion and silence Tara and Willow. Tara was created to appear in only a few episodes as a friend with whom Willow could learn magic and develop her skills. Amber Benson had known Hannigan previously but did not tell her she was up for the part. Benson almost missed a callback audition because she left town, but the casting department postponed the session so she could return and read. When she did, Hannigan found her on set and upon learning she was up for the role, told Whedon to hire Benson at the same moment Benson got the call from her agent that she had won the part. Benson and Hannigan had such chemistry that the relationship was written to be more intimate. In &quot;Hush&quot;, Tara and Willow each individually attempt to use magic to move a heavy object, without success. They then join hands and easily fling the object across the room. Whedon and the producers found the scene to be very sensual. Network executives also noticed the chemistry between the actresses. After some discussion, Whedon informed Benson and Hannigan that the characters would become lovers.

Willow was featured from the beginning of the series and already had a strong fanbase. Earlier in the fourth season, she had a boyfriend named Oz (Seth Green), who abruptly left town. Oz returns in the episode &quot;New Moon Rising&quot;, determined to win Willow back. That episode marked the first time Tara is introduced to the Scooby Gang as a whole, and Willow is faced with choosing between Tara and Oz. She favors Tara in the end, causing some of the show&#x27;s fans to react angrily on the fansite message boards, with some leaving homophobic remarks and characterizing Benson as overweight and unattractive. Benson, who was referred to as &quot;astoundingly non-Hollywood&quot; by a Scottish journalist, frequented the boards and read the comments, finding them hurtful and taking some of them personally. She responded, protesting that she was, at and , quite slender, although she appears larger than her more petite costars. She went on to write:

Network executives encouraged the lesbian element in the relationship, but put strict guidelines on what could be shown. &quot;Buffy&quot; scholar Jeffrey L. Pasley summarizes the planning behind the relationship: 

For several episodes in the fourth season, Tara and Willow&#x27;s friendship grows as they practice magic. To work within the censorship imposed on their relationship, writers used allusions to spells and witchcraft to symbolize their affection and growing sexuality. Willow does not tell her friends about Tara for several episodes, instead just expressing the wish to spend time with Tara, where she can have something just for herself. Tara is unwaveringly supportive and committed to Willow.

==Seasons==

===4 and 5===
When Tara and Willow meet, their proficiency at magic is about the same, but Tara&#x27;s knowledge of the craft far exceeds Willow&#x27;s. Tara reveals that she has been practicing magic for most of her life, as her deceased mother had also been a powerful witch. Throughout season 4, Tara acts as a partner and guide in Willow&#x27;s witchcraft, teaching Willow spells and performing magic together. Willow, however, is inherently talented, despite being new to the craft, and begins to progress much faster than Tara in the fifth season, including experimentations in dark magic. Tara struggles with understanding her place among the Scoobies with Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), the leader, with whom she has a very friendly relationship; Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon), Willow&#x27;s friend since childhood; and Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), their mentor. Tara&#x27;s primary role throughout the series is that of Willow&#x27;s partner. She feels somewhat useless until the fifth-season episode &quot;Family&quot; when the entire Scooby Gang (Spike included) makes it clear that she is unquestionably a part of them. The episode introduces some of Tara&#x27;s blood family: a cold, authoritarian father who has lied to her all her life (telling her that her magical powers are a result of her being part-demon on her mother&#x27;s side); an overbearing brother; and a judgmental, repressed and repressive cousin; all of whom Tara dismisses at the end of the episode. Tara later reveals in &quot;The Body&quot; that her mother had died when she was 17. In the following episode, when Dawn is acting out, Tara confides to Buffy that she had to deal with her brother after her mother&#x27;s death. No more of her backstory is revealed in the series.

As Willow&#x27;s character grows more self-assured and powerful through the seasons, Tara takes over some of the role of being placed in peril and needing to be rescued. The fifth season&#x27;s primary villain, or Big Bad, is Glory, a goddess too powerful for Buffy to fight alone. Glory tortures Tara in order to gain information on the Key, but Tara asserts willpower and resists Glory, resulting in Glory stealing her sanity, and prompting Willow to go searching for retribution. Glory states she feels &quot;buzzed&quot; after feeding on Tara&#x27;s mind, indicating Tara&#x27;s powerful intellect (and possibly suggesting her power as a witch).

&quot;Buffy&quot; scholar Ian Shuttleworth writes that Benson was able to &quot;admirably&quot; portray the same range of emotions inherent in Tara although the character loses her identity. Willow&#x27;s powers are significant enough that she is able to battle Glory more effectively than Buffy, if not completely successfully. In the final episode of season 5, Willow uses her magic to restore Tara&#x27;s sanity, significantly weakening Glory in the process.

Tara also becomes a guide of sorts, and a maternal figure. She appears to Buffy in a dream in the fourth season finale &quot;Restless&quot; to tell her about the arrival of Buffy&#x27;s sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) and act as a translator for the voiceless First Slayer. Following the death of Joyce Summers and Buffy&#x27;s sacrifice to save the world at the end of the fifth season, Tara and Willow move into the Summers house, taking Joyce&#x27;s bedroom and becoming Dawn&#x27;s surrogate parents.

===6 and comics===
Tara becomes more outspoken during the sixth season about the ethics of Willow&#x27;s use of magic, cautioning Willow that she depends too much on it. The dynamics of their relationship suddenly turn during &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;. Willow had cast a spell on Tara to alter her memory in the preceding episode and Tara finds out about it during &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;, the musical episode of the series. Tara was given a prominent role in the musical due to the skill of Benson&#x27;s voice: she sings a love ballad to Willow, a duet with Giles, and backup in two other songs. The musical nature of the episode compelled the characters to express what they had been feeling secretly, or had refused to admit to themselves. Tara&#x27;s song is a fervent and explicit expression of love for Willow which she had not made clear to the audience until this point. Tara later sings with Giles that she will leave Willow if she does not change. Self-conscious about her singing abilities, Hannigan requested not to be given a song and sings only a few lines in the episode. Critics saw this as Tara&#x27;s personality becoming more forceful as Willow begins to show signs of weakness as she is overtaken by her addiction. Tara challenges Willow to go for a week without using any magic. Willow almost immediately breaks her promise, however, and Tara leaves her at the end of &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;. Tara remains a part of the group, spending time with Dawn, and non-judgmentally acting as Buffy&#x27;s confessor when Buffy divulges she has a painful and compulsive sexual relationship with Spike, a vampire whom she loathes.

Despite their separation, Tara remains devoted to Willow&#x27;s recovery and supports her in her decision to abstain from using magic. She is, according to author Lorna Jowett, one of the few characters who is never seduced by evil. Shuttleworth notes that most &quot;Buffy&quot; characters go through a rite of transformation except for Tara. Among female characters she is the most virtuous. Like the other &quot;Buffy&quot; characters in the series whose names have symbolic interpretations, Tara&#x27;s name resembles the Latin &quot;terra&quot;, meaning &quot;earth.&quot; She is solidly grounded, with Willow attached to her, and Benson&#x27;s body more naturally representative of women. Tara is wholly feminine both in dress and demeanor, as opposed to Buffy and (less) Willow mostly dressed with trousers and jackets, but never seeks male approval. She is clad in earthy, natural colors, long flowing skirts and clinging blouses, with an intent to comfort instead of arouse as other women on the show are dressed. Her admonishments to other characters are always made with love, with their best interests at heart. Even Tara&#x27;s last words, commenting that Willow&#x27;s shirt is stained (with Tara&#x27;s own blood), indicate her preoccupation with the welfare of others.

Tara has also appeared in &quot;The Long Way Home&quot;, &quot;Always Darkest&quot;, &quot;Retreat&quot;, and the one-off &quot;Willow&quot;.

==Death and response==

After tentatively courting each other in &quot;Entropy&quot;, Tara returns to Willow, and they reconcile through the next episode, &quot;Seeing Red&quot;. Throughout the season, Buffy is dogged by three techno-nerds calling themselves The Trio, who envision themselves to be supervillains, with Buffy their nemesis. She continues to foil their plans, and during &quot;Seeing Red&quot;, Warren Mears, one of the Trio, arrives at Buffy&#x27;s house with a gun. He shoots several rounds, hitting Buffy, and the last stray shot hits Tara through the heart, killing her as Willow looks on. Willow is taken over by a dark alter ego, going on a rampage, torturing Warren and skinning him alive. She then attempts to murder the other two members of the Trio, but is unsuccessful. To end her pain, she attempts to end the world. Xander stops her by forcing her to deal with her grief in a healthy, non-violent way.

During the fifth season, Whedon informed Benson that Tara would be killed off. He saw it as necessary to further Willow&#x27;s character; she had to deal with her dark powers, but nothing short of Tara&#x27;s death would allow them to come out so forcefully. Tara had become popular among fans, and Whedon and series writer David Fury decided that her death would elicit a strong response, something that Whedon felt sure was the correct course to take. He was unprepared, however, for how forcefully viewers reacted to Tara&#x27;s death. Fans were so upset that some stopped watching. Because the death came at the end of an episode where Willow and Tara were portrayed in bed between sexual encounters, critics accused Whedon of implying that lesbian sex should be punishable by death, a familiar trope in film. Producers were inundated with mail from people—women especially—who expressed their anger, sadness, and frustration with the writing team. Series writer and producer Marti Noxon was unable to read some of the mail because it was so distressing, but she counted the response as a natural indication that television simply had few strong female role models, and no lesbian representation.

Benson defended Whedon in 2007, saying he &quot;is 100 percent behind the LGBT community. I know this for a fact.&quot; Author Rhonda Wilcox writes that Tara&#x27;s death is made more poignant by her earthy naturalness representing the &quot;fragility of the physical&quot;. Roz Kaveney comments that Tara&#x27;s murder is &quot;one of the most upsetting moments of the show&#x27;s seven seasons&quot;, and Nikki Stafford states that the episode in which Tara dies is possibly the most controversial of the series, causing divisions about whether it was necessary, or assertions that Tara was created only to be killed. In response to fans and critics who accused the writers of being motivated by homophobia, Stafford comments, &quot;they seem to forget that it was those same writers who created such an amazing, gentle, and realistic portrait in the first place; that Tara is certainly not the first character to be killed off on the show; and Tara was a lot more than just &#x27;the lesbian&#x27;, and her character deserves better than that.&quot; Kaveney concurs with the opinion that the series avoided playing a cliché, &quot;proving that it is possible for a queer character to die in popular culture without that death being the surrogate vengeance of the straight world&quot;.

While other deaths of main characters in the &quot;Buffy&quot; universe have been reversed in some form (as has been the case with Buffy herself, Cordelia, Giles, Angel, Spike, Anya, Connor, Gunn, Fred, Illyria and Wesley), Tara remains dead as of the season 10 comic series. She remains one of only three main characters not to have been resurrected in any way, the others being Doyle and Lorne (whose actors have died).

==Cultural impact==
===Viewer response===
Although lesbianism had been addressed on U.S. television before Tara was introduced to &quot;Buffy&quot;, her relationship with Willow was heralded as a milestone. Previously depicted lesbian relationships had not shown characters as sexual beings, or even touching each other. Despite this, Tara and Willow&#x27;s relationship was not heralded with any specific fanfare on the show; they are treated as other couples. Their relationship was frequently the subject of storylines, but no specific focus was on their identity as lesbians or the coming out process. Limited to what could be shown by the network, Tara and Willow are shown as consistently affectionate but not overly sexual. Manda Scott in &quot;The Herald&quot; wrote in 2002 that the lack of realistic displays of touching or kissing between Willow and Tara made their relationship implausible, but because no other portrayals of lesbian relationships were on television, its importance is undeniable. Tara and Willow did not kiss until the fifth-season episode &quot;The Body&quot;, which focused on the death of Joyce Summers. Not until &quot;Buffy&quot; moved from The WB to UPN in 2001 were Tara and Willow shown in sexual situations. Benson later recalled the issues of working with censors:

Like Whedon, Benson was surprised at the strength of the reaction to Tara&#x27;s death. It indicated to her what kind of impact the characters had:

The Big Bad of the seventh season is the First Evil, who taunts Buffy and her friends by appearing as loved ones who previously died. Whedon asked Benson to appear as Tara to Willow in &quot;Conversations with Dead People&quot;, but Benson turned down the role, concerned about what fans of the show would think about an evil Tara. Instead, the producers used Cassie, a character who dies early in the seventh season and speaks for Tara, telling Willow to kill herself. Whedon also considered bringing Tara back in a storyline where Buffy would be given one wish to be granted, but the possibility did not come to fruition.

Writer Peg Aloi calls the backlash at Whedon &quot;staggering&quot;, and summarizes Tara&#x27;s effect with Willow, stating that they were a single unit the moment they met: &quot;Willow&#x27;s need for approval and Tara&#x27;s need for unconditional love allowed their supernova trajectory its singular, incendiary thrust toward its triumphant but tragic end; like all witches who burn, martyred by flames, they move on to a place where their gods are the right ones.&quot;

===Political aspects===
As a show with an obvious feminist agenda, &quot;Buffy&quot; and its female characters at times represent, or provoke questions and conversation about, such political and economic themes as gender roles, implicit stereotypes, in-groups and out-groups, and, with Tara&#x27;s appearance on the show, sexuality and gender identity-based cultures. Politics is, to paraphrase Buffy&#x27;s comment to Quentin Travers in &quot;Checkpoint,&quot; about power: who has it and who does not. Tara frequently does not; before she meets Willow, that is, and during her suffering from Glory&#x27;s assault. It can be argued, as by the writers here, that simply by virtue of her attachment to Willow she is endangered by characters including Glory and by powers external to the Buffyverse including Mutant Enemy.

Pasley, the &quot;Buffy&quot; scholar, writes of the cultural climate coexistent with the show&#x27;s original run and its later, lasting fandom,

The term &quot;Dead/Evil Lesbian Cliché&quot; was ideated and popularized by members of a forum, &quot;The Kitten, The Witches and the Bad Wardrobe,&quot; following the events of &quot;Seeing Red&quot;. Their arguments and conclusions led to an online FAQ page, &quot;The Death of Tara, the Fall of Willow and The Dead/Evil Lesbian Cliché FAQ.&quot; Among other topics, the FAQ analyzes the forensics and metaphors of Tara&#x27;s death and Willow&#x27;s descent into vengeance. Among their statements: &quot;Tara attracted many fans who are marginalized in society because they are shy or gay or stuttered or all three,&quot; and the Cliché is &quot;likely to increase the incidence of homophobia in society, and make gays and lesbians of all ages feel unwelcome and disliked.&quot;

In his piece &quot;The Tara Controversy,&quot; Pasley wrote,

Pasley considers the liability held by Mutant Enemy, too:

As Willow says to Buffy about Tara, &quot;It&#x27;s complicated.&quot;

<doc id="211259" wikidata="Q13137720" url="?curid=211259" title="76 mm Schneider-Danglis Mountain Gun Model 1909">
<text>The 76 mm Schneider-Danglis Mountain Gun Model 1909 (Russian 76-мм горная пушка Шнейдера-Данглиса, модель 1909) was a rapid-fire mountain gun based on the Schneider-Danglis mountain gun that was used by the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and the Red Army during World War II

== History ==
In 1893, the Greek engineer Colonel Panagiotis Danglis developed a design for a 75 mm mountain cannon and submitted it to the Greek Ministry of War. However, he would have to wait ten years before his project was authorized. In 1905, Danglis proposed to the French firm Schneider that a prototype of his gun should be entered in the next competition for the Greek Army. Schneider developed its own carriage for the gun and the revised design was known as the Schneider-Danglis mountain gun. The prototype was tested in France in May 1906 and in April the gun was tested in Greece, after which the gun was adopted for service by the Greek Army. Early in 1909, the Schneider company had produced enough guns to arm six batteries.

== Design ==
The 76 mm Mountain Gun Model 1909 was a breech-loaded howitzer made of steel with an interrupted screw breech and used fixed quick-fire ammunition. It had a box trail carriage, gun shield, two wooden-spoked steel-rimmed wheels, and a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism. For transport, the gun could be dismantled into seven mule loads or hooked to a limber and caisson for towing by a horse team when assembled.

== Imperial Russian Army ==
At the beginning of 1908, a Schneider-Danglis gun was demonstrated to the inspector general of artillery of the Imperial Russian Army, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich. At his request, Nicholas II instructed the army to perform competitive tests of rapid-fire mountain guns from Schneider and the Škoda Works. Two guns from Schneider and Škoda were tested by the army in December 1908. An advantage of the Škoda system was its lower weight that made it easier to transport. While the Schneider-Danglis cannon had better ballistics and a reliable hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism instead of the Škoda spring recoil system.

As a result of the tests, the Artillery Committee obtained a production license from Schneider. On February 25, 1909, the Artillery Committee requested the adoption of the gun to Emperor Nicholas II which he authorized on February 26. Based on the test results, it was decided to replace the original wheels and the sight of the Schneider company with Okhremenko wheels and Hertz panoramic sights produced by the Obukhov Plant. The new gun would also use 76.2 × 191 mm R fixed quick-fire ammunition. Tests revealed that only the ammunition packs met the stipulated weight and the rest of the packs weighed from which was too heavy for Russian packhorses. The joints of the carriage also wobbled and rattled while being towed.

== Production ==
It is believed 2,060 M1909s were produced between 1909-1938. On January 1, 1912, all 214 guns of the first order from the Putilov Plant were delivered. Between 1911-1916, the Putilov Plant received orders for another 772 guns. By June 20, 1917, the Putilov Plant had delivered 636 guns from these orders. Another 349 guns were built between 1914-1917, at the St. Petersburg Gun Factory. 

Production of the M1909 resumed during the 1920s at plant No. 8 (St. Petersburg Gun Factory, evacuated in 1918 to the village of Podlipki). Between 1924 and 1931, 110 guns were produced there. After that, production was transferred to plant No. 92 (Novoye Sormovo). No guns were produced at plant No. 92 during 1932, 1934, and 1936.
== Variants ==
* The 76 mm counter-assault gun Model 1910 - was a revised version of the M1909. The barrel, breech, and recoil mechanism of the M1909 was installed on a new one-piece box trail carriage which was designed to be light to improve its maneuverability. The M1910 was a &quot;fortress gun&quot; or &quot;flanking gun&quot; that was designed to fire shrapnel rounds at short distances and low angles into massed formations of enemy infantry attacking Russian fortifications. The M1910 fired the same projectiles as the M1909, but with a reduced propellant charge to reduce recoil. Serial production of the M1910 began at the Putilov Plant in 1911 and continued until mid-1915. In total, 407 guns were produced during this period in two batches. The M1910 was also used to arm Garford-Putilov Armored Cars.
* The 76 mm infantry gun Model 1913 - was a revised version of the M1909/M1910 that was designed to be an infantry support gun. An early criticism of the M1910 was that its carriage was too flimsy to be towed over rough ground so once again barrel, breech, and recoil mechanism of the M1909 was installed on a new rugged one-piece box trail carriage that was able to withstand rough use. The M1913 was tested and put into production at the Putilov plant in 1914 and also entered service in 1914. 173 M1913 guns were produced by the Putilov Plant.
*The 7.62 cm Infanteriegeschütz L/16.5 - was a German infantry support gun that mated the barrel, breech, and recoil mechanism of captured M1910s on a rugged one-piece box trail carriage built by Krupp. Large numbers of M1910&#x27;s had been captured early in the war in Poland and Krupp was ordered to adapt them for German use. 
*The 76 LK/10/13 - was a Finnish-built gun that mounted the barrel, breech, and recoil mechanism from captured M1910s on a Finnish-built box trail carriage that was an exact copy of the Russian M1913 carriage. The 76 LK/10/13 was also used as an infantry support gun.

== See also ==
* 76 mm regimental gun M1927 - The design of the M1913 was used as the pattern for the M1927. The M1927 could be towed by a horse team and was later modified for motor traction by adding a sprung axle and pneumatic tires.
*75 mm Schneider-Danglis 06/09 first model 75mm mountain gun used by multiple countries prior to, during and after World War I.

== Users ==
* - A number of captured M1910 barrels were mated to newly built carriages by Krupp and used by the German Army. 
* - On November 1, 1936, the Red Army had 622 M1909 guns in service, of which 572 were serviceable, 34 were training guns and 1 was unusable. 80 guns took part in the Winter War and 8 were lost. On June 22, 1941, the Red Army had 1,121 M1906 guns, of which 366 were in reserve.
* - Romania may have operated an unknown number of captured M1909s that had been converted to fire 75 mm ammunition. The Romanians had also bought 24 Schneider-Danglis 75 mm guns in 1912 that they designated Tunul de munte Schneider, calibrul 75 mm, md. 1912.
* - Poland may have operated an unknown number under the designation 76.2 mm Armata górska wz. 1909.
* - Finland captured 49 M1910 and 76 M1913 guns during the Finnish Civil War and gave them the designations 76 LK/10 and 76 LK/13. Finland later bought another 45 guns. Finland converted 40 captured M1910 guns by putting them on Finnish-built M1913 carriages and gave them the designation 76 LK/10/13.
* - In 1941, the Germans captured an unknown number of M1909s, which they designated 7.62 cm GebK 293(r).

<text>Schenkerian analysis is a method of analyzing tonal music based on the theories of Heinrich Schenker (1868–1935). The goal is to demonstrate the organic coherence of the work by showing how the &quot;foreground&quot; (all notes in the score) relates to an abstracted deep structure, the &quot;Ursatz&quot;. This primal structure is roughly the same for any tonal work, but a Schenkerian analysis shows how, in each individual case, that structure develops into a unique work at the foreground. A key theoretical concept is &quot;tonal space&quot;. The intervals between the notes of the tonic triad in the background form a &quot;tonal space&quot; that is filled with passing and neighbour tones, producing new triads and new tonal spaces that are open for further elaborations until the &quot;surface&quot; of the work (the score) is reached.

The analysis uses a specialized symbolic form of musical notation. Although Schenker himself usually presents his analyses in the generative direction, starting from the &quot;Ursatz&quot; to reach the score and showing how the work is somehow generated from the &quot;Ursatz&quot;, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, starting from the score and showing how it can be reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the &quot;Ursatz&quot; is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise. Even at intermediate levels of reduction, rhythmic signs (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) display not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events.

Schenkerian analysis is an abstract, complex, and difficult method, not always clearly expressed by Schenker himself and not always clearly understood. It mainly aims to reveal the internal coherence of the work – a coherence that ultimately resides in its being tonal. In some respects, a Schenkerian analysis can reflect the perceptions and intuitions of the analyst.

==Fundamentals==

===Goals===
Schenker intended his theory as an exegesis of musical &quot;genius&quot; or the &quot;masterwork&quot;, ideas that were closely tied to German nationalism and monarchism. The canon represented in his analytical work therefore is almost entirely made up of German music of the common practice period (especially that of Johann Sebastian Bach, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, and Johannes Brahms), and he used his methods to oppose more modern styles of music such as that of Max Reger and Igor Stravinsky. This led him to seek the key to an understanding of music in the traditional disciplines of counterpoint and figured bass, which was central to the compositional training of these composers. Schenker&#x27;s project was to show that free composition (&quot;freier Satz&quot;) was an elaboration, a &quot;prolongation&quot;, of strict composition (&quot;strenger Satz&quot;), by which he meant species counterpoint, particularly two-voice counterpoint. He did this by developing a theory of hierarchically organized levels of elaboration (&quot;Auskomponierung&quot;), called prolongational levels, voice-leading levels (&quot;Stimmführungsschichten&quot;), or transformations (&quot;Verwandlungen&quot;), the idea being that each of the successive levels represents a new freedom taken with respect to the rules of strict composition.

Because the first principle of the elaboration is the filling in of the tonal space by passing notes, an essential goal of the analysis is to show linear connections between notes which, filling a single triad at a given level, remain closely related to each other but which, at subsequent levels, may become separated by many measures or many pages as new triads are embedded in the first one. The analyst is expected to develop a &quot;distance hearing&quot; (&quot;Fernhören&quot;), a &quot;structural hearing&quot;.

===Harmony===
The tonic triad, that from which the work as a whole arises, takes its model in the harmonic series. However,
the mere duplication of nature cannot be the object of human endeavour. Therefore ... the overtone series ... is transformed into a succession, a horizontal arpeggiation, which has the added advantage of lying within the range of the human voice. Thus the harmonic series is condensed, abbreviated for the purposes of art&quot;.

Linking the (major) triad to the harmonic series, Schenker merely pays lip service to an idea common in the early 20th century. He confirms that the same derivation cannot be made for the minor triad:
Any attempt to derive even as much as the first foundation of this [minor] system, i.e., the minor triad itself, from Nature, i.e., from the overtone series, would be more than futile. ... The explanation becomes much easier if artistic intention rather than Nature herself is credited with the origin of the minor mode.&quot;.

The basic component of Schenkerian harmony is the &quot;Stufe&quot; (scale degree, scale-step), i.e. a chord having gained structural significance. Chords arise from within chords, as the result of the combination of passing notes and arpeggiations: they are at first mere embellishments, mere voice-leading constructions, but they become tonal spaces open for further elaboration and, once elaborated, can be considered structurally significant: they become scale-steps properly speaking. Schenker recognizes that &quot;there are no rules which could be laid down once and for all&quot; for recognizing scale-steps, but from his examples one may deduce that a triad cannot be recognized as a scale-step as long as it can be explained by passing or neighboring voice-leading.

Schenkerian analyses label scale-steps with Roman numerals, a practice common in 19th- and 20th-century Vienna, developed by the theoretic work of Georg Joseph Vogler and his student Gottfried Weber, transmitted by Simon Sechter and his disciple Anton Bruckner, the classes of whom Schenker had followed in the Konservatorium in Vienna.

Schenker&#x27;s theory is monotonal: the &quot;Ursatz&quot;, as the diatonic unfolding of the tonic triad, by definition cannot include modulation. Local &quot;tonicisation&quot; may arise when a scale-step is elaborated to the point of becoming a local tonic, but the work as a whole projects a single key and ultimately a single &quot;Stufe&quot; (the tonic).

===Counterpoint, voice-leading===
Two-voice counterpoint remains for Schenker the model of strict writing. Free composition is a freer usage of the laws of strict counterpoint. One of the aims of the analysis is to trace how the work remains subject to these laws at the deepest level, despite the freedom taken at subsequent levels.

One aspect of strict, two-voice writing that appears to span Schenker&#x27;s theory throughout the years of its elaboration is the rule of &quot;fluent melody&quot; (&quot;fließender Gesang&quot;), or &quot;melodic fluency&quot;. Schenker attributes the rule to Luigi Cherubini, who would have written that &quot;fluent melody is always preferable in strict counterpoint.&quot; Melodic fluency, the preference for conjunct (stepwise) motion, is one of the main rules of voice leading, even in free composition. It avoids successive leaps and produces &quot;a kind of wave-like melodic line which as a whole represents an animated entity, and which, with its ascending and descending curves, appears balanced in all its individual component parts&quot;. This idea is at the origin of that of linear progression (&quot;Zug&quot;) and, more specifically, of that of the Fundamental Line (&quot;Urlinie&quot;).

===Ursatz===
&quot;Ursatz&quot; (usually translated as &quot;fundamental structure&quot;) is the name given by Schenker to the underlying structure in its simplest form, that from which the work as a whole originates. In the canonical form of the theory, it consists of the &quot;Urlinie&quot;, the &quot;fundamental line&quot;, supported by the &quot;Bassbrechung&quot;, the &quot;arpeggiation of the bass&quot;. The fundamental structure is a two-voice counterpoint and as such belongs to strict composition. In conformity with the theory of the tonal space, the fundamental line is a line starting from any note of the triad and descending to the tonic itself. The arpeggiation is an arpeggiation through the fifth, ascending from I to V and descending back to I. The &quot;Urlinie&quot; unfolds the tonal space in a melodic dimension, while the &quot;Bassbrechung&quot; expresses its harmonic dimension.

The theory of the fundamental structure is the most criticized aspect of Schenkerian theory: it has seemed unacceptable to reduce all tonal works to one of a few almost identical background structures. This is a misunderstanding: Schenkerian analysis is not about demonstrating that all compositions can be reduced to the same background, but about showing how each work elaborates the background in a unique, individual manner, determining both its identity and its &quot;meaning&quot;. Schenker has made this his motto: &quot;Semper idem, sed non eodem modo&quot;, &quot;always the same, but never in the same manner&quot;.

====Fundamental line====

The idea of the fundamental line comes quite early in the development of Schenker&#x27;s theory. Its first printed mention dates from 1920, in the edition of Beethoven&#x27;s Sonata Op. 101, but the idea obviously links with that of &quot;fluent melody&quot;, ten years earlier. Schenker first conceived the &quot;Urlinie&quot;, the &quot;fundamental line&quot;, as a kind of motivic line characterized by its fluency, repeated under different guises throughout the work and ensuring its homogeneity. He later imagined that a musical work should have only one fundamental line, unifying it from beginning to end. The realization that such fundamental lines usually were descending led him to formulate the canonical definition of the fundamental line as necessarily descending. It is not that he rejected ascending lines, but that he came to consider them hierarchically less important. &quot;The fundamental line begins with , or and moves to via the descending leading tone &quot;. The initial note of the fundamental line is called its &quot;head tone&quot; (&quot;Kopfton&quot;) or &quot;primary tone&quot;. The head note may be elaborated by an upper neighbour note, but not a lower one. In many cases, the head note is reached through an ascending line (&quot;Anstieg&quot;, &quot;initial ascent&quot;) or an ascending arpeggiation, which do not belong to the fundamental structure properly speaking.

====Arpeggiation of the bass and the divider at the fifth====

The arpeggiation through the fifth is an imitation of the overtone series, adapted to man [sic] &quot;who within his own capacities can experience sound only in a succession&quot;. The fifth of the arpeggiation coincides with the last passing note of the fundamental line. This at first produces a mere &quot;divider at the fifth&quot;, a complex filling in of the tonal space. However, as a consonant combination, it defines at a further level a new tonal space, that of the dominant chord, and so doing opens the path for further developments of the work. It would appear that the difference between the divider at the fifth and the dominant chord properly speaking really depends on the level at which the matter is considered: the notion of the divider at the fifth views it as an elaboration of the initial tonal space, while the notion of dominant chord conceives it as a new tonal space created within the first. But the opinions of modern Schenkerians diverge on this point.

==Schenkerian notation==
Graphic representations form an important part of Schenkerian analyses: &quot;the use of music notation to represent musical relationships is a unique feature of Schenker&#x27;s work&quot;. Schenkerian graphs are based on a &quot;hierarchic&quot; notation, where the size of the notes, their rhythmic values and/or other devices indicate their structural importance. Schenker himself, in the foreword to his &quot;Five Graphic Analyses&quot;, claimed that &quot;the presentation in graphic form has now been developed to a point that makes an explanatory text unnecessary&quot;. Even so, Schenkerian graphs represent a change of semiotic system, a shift from music itself to its graphical representation, akin to the more usual change from music to verbal (analytic) commentary; but this shift already exists in the score itself, and Schenker rightly noted the analogy between music notation and analysis. One aspect of graphic analyses that may not have been enough stressed is the desire to abolish time, to represent the musical work as something that could be apprehended at a glance or, at least, in a way that would replace a &quot;linear&quot; reading by a &quot;tabular&quot; one.
The first step of the analytic rewriting often takes the form of a &quot;rhythmic&quot; reduction, that is one that preserves the score, but &quot;normalizes&quot; its rhythm and its voice-leading content. This type of reduction has a long tradition, not only in counterpoint treatises or theory books, but also in the simplified notation of some Baroque works, e.g. the Prelude to Händel&#x27;s Suite in A major, HWV 426, or early versions of Bach&#x27;s C major Prelude of Book I of the Well Tempered Keyboard. One indirect advantage of rhythmic reduction is that it helps reading the voice leading: Czerny&#x27;s example hereby transforms Chopin&#x27;s arpeggios into a composition in four (or five) voices. Edward Aldwell and Carl Schachter write that the first rewriting should &quot;produce a setting that is reasonably close to note-against-note.&quot; Allen Cadwallader and David Gagné suggest a special type of rhythmic reduction that they call &quot;imaginary continuo&quot;, stressing the link between the rhythmic reduction and a notation as a melody with figured bass. Basically, it consists in imagining a figured bass line for the work analyzed, and writing a chordal realization of it.

Schenker himself usually began his analyses with a rhythmic reduction that he termed &quot;Urlinietafel&quot;. From 1925 onwards, he complemented these with other levels of representation, corresponding to the successive steps leading to the fundamental structure. At first, he mainly relied on the size of the note shapes to denote their hierarchic level, but later abandoned this system as it proved too complex for contemporary techniques of musical engraving. Allen Cadwallader and David Gagné propose a description of Schenker&#x27;s system of graphic notation which, they say, &quot;is flexible, enabling musicians to express in subtle (and sometimes different) ways what they hear and how they interpret a composition&quot;. They discuss open noteheads, usually indicating the highest structural level, and filled-in noteheads for tones of lower levels; slurs, grouping tones in an arpeggio or in linear motions with passing or neighbor tones; beams, for linear motions of higher structural level or for the arpeggiation of the bass; broken ties, for repeated or sustained tones; diagonal lines to realign displaced notes; diagonal beams, connecting successive notes that belong to the same chord (&quot;unfolding&quot;); etc.

==Techniques of prolongation==

The meat of a Schenkerian analysis is in showing how a background structure expands until it results in the succession of musical events on the surface of the composition itself. Schenker refers to this process under the term &quot;Auskomponierung&quot;, literally &quot;composing out&quot;, but more often translated as &quot;elaboration&quot;. Modern Schenkerians usually prefer the term &quot;prolongation&quot;, stressing that elaborations develop the events along the time axis.

Schenker writes:
In practical art the main problem is how to realize the concept of harmony in a live content. In Chopin&#x27;s Prelude, Op. 28, No 6, thus, it is the motif 
:that gives life to the abstract concept of the triad, B, D, F-sharp.
The elaboration of the triad, here mainly in the form of an arpeggio, loads it with &quot;live content&quot;, with meaning. Elaborations take the form of &quot;diminutions&quot;, replacing the total duration of the elaborated event by shorter events in larger number. By this, notes are displaced both in pitch and in rhythmic position. The analysis to some extent aims at restoring displaced notes to their &quot;normal&quot; position and explaining how and why they were displaced.


One aspect of Schenkerian analysis is that it does not view the work as built from a succession of events, but as the growth of new events from within events of higher level, much as a tree develops twigs from its branches and branches from its trunk: it is in this sense that Schenkerian theory must be considered organicist. The example shown here may at first be considered a mere elaboration of an F major chord, an arpeggiation in three voices, with passing notes (shown here in black notes without stem) in the two higher voices: it is an exemplification of the tonal space of F major. The chord labelled (V) at first merely is a &quot;divider at the fifth&quot;. However, the meeting of the fifth (C) in the bass arpeggiation with the passing notes may also be understood as producing a dominant chord, V, arising from within the tonic chord I. This is the situation found at the beginning of Haydn&#x27;s Sonata in F major, Hob. XVI:29, where the (incomplete) dominant chord appears at the very end of bar 3, while the rest of the fragment consists of arpeggios (with neighbor notes) of the F chord:
===Arpeggiation, neighbour note, passing note===
Arpeggiation is the simplest form of elaboration. It delimits a tonal space for elaboration, but lacks the melodic dimension that would allow further developments: it &quot;remains a harmonic phenomenon&quot;. From the very structure of triads (chords), it follows that arpeggiations remain disjunct and that any filling of their space involves conjunct motion. Schenker distinguishes two types of filling of the tonal space: 1) neighbor notes (&quot;Nebennoten&quot;), ornamenting one single note of the triad by being adjacent to it. These are sometimes referred to generically as &quot;adjacencies&quot;;
2) passing notes, which pass by means of stepwise motion from one note to another and fill the space in between, and are thus sometimes referred to as &quot;connectives&quot;.
Both neighbor notes and passing notes are dissonances. They may be made consonant by their coinciding with other notes (as in the Haydn example above) and, once consonant, may delimit further tonal spaces open to further elaborations. Insofar as chords consist of several voices, arpeggiations and passing notes always involve passing from one voice to another.

===Linear progression===

A linear progression (&quot;Zug&quot;) is the stepwise filling of some consonant interval. It usually is underlined in graphic analyses with a slur from the first note of the progression to the last.
The most elementary linear progressions are determined by the tonal space that they elaborate: they span from the prime to the third, from the third to the fifth or from the fifth to the octave of the triad, in ascending or descending direction. Schenker writes: &quot;there are no other tonal spaces than those of 1–3, 3–5, and 5–8. There is no origin for passing-tone- progressions, or for melody&quot; Linear progressions, in other words, may be either third progressions (&quot;Terzzüge&quot;) or fourth progressions (&quot;Quartzüge&quot;); larger progressions result from a combination of these.
Linear progressions may be incomplete (deceptive) when one of their tones is replaced by another, but nevertheless suggested by the harmony. In the example below, the first bars of Beethoven&#x27;s Sonata Op. 109, the bass line descends from E3 to E2. F2 is replaced by B1 in order to mark the cadence, but it remains implicit in the B chord. In addition, the top voice answers the bass line by a voice exchange, E4–F4–G4 above G2–(F2)–E2, in bar 3, after a descending arpeggio of the E major chord. The bass line is doubled in parallel tenths by the alto voice, descending from G4 to G3, and the tenor voice alternatively doubles the soprano and the bass, as indicated by the dotted slurs. It is the bass line that governs the passage as a whole: it is the &quot;leading progression&quot;, on which all the other voices depend and which best expresses the elaboration of the E major chord.
Schenker describes lines covering a seventh or a ninth as &quot;illusory&quot;, considering that they stand for a second (with a register transfer): they do not fill a tonal space, they pass from one chord to another.

===Lines between voices, reaching over===
Passing tones filling the intervals of a chord may be considered forming lines between the voices of this chord. At the same time, if the chord tones themselves are involved in lines from one chord to another (as usually is the case), lines of lower level unfurl between lines of higher level. The most interesting case is when the lines link an inner voice to the upper voice. This may happen not only in ascending (a case usually described as a &quot;line from an inner voice&quot;), but also in descending, if the inner voice has been displaced above the upper line by a register transfer, a case known as &quot;reaching over&quot; (&quot;Übergreifen&quot;, also translated as &quot;superposition&quot; or &quot;overlapping&quot;). In the example from Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Wanderers Nachtlied&quot; below, the descending line G–F–E–D at the end of the first bar may be read as a reaching over.

===Unfolding===

Unfolding (&quot;Ausfaltung&quot;) is an elaboration by which several voices of a chord or of a succession of chords are combined in one single line &quot;in such a manner that a tone of the upper voice is connected to a tone of the inner voice and then moves back, or the reverse&quot;. At the end of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Wanderers Nachtlied&quot; op. 4 no. 3, the vocal melody unfolds two voices of the succession I–V–I; the lower voice, B–A–G, is the main one, expressing the tonality of G major; the upper voice, D–C–B, is doubled one octave lower in the right hand of the accompaniment:
In his later writings (from 1930 onwards), Schenker sometimes used a special sign to denote the unfolding, an oblique beam connecting notes of the different voices that are conceptually simultaneous, even if they are presented in succession in the single line performing the unfolding.

===Register transfer, coupling===
&quot;Register transfer&quot; is the motion of one or several voices into a different octave (i.e. into a different register). Schenker considers that music normally unfolds in one register, the &quot;obligatory register&quot; (Ger. &quot;Obligate Lage&quot;), but at times is displaced to higher or lower registers. These are called, respectively, &quot;ascending register transfer&quot; (Ger. &quot;Höherlegung&quot;) and &quot;descending register transfer&quot; (Ger. &quot;Tieferlegung&quot;). Register transfers are particularly striking in piano music (and that for other keyboard instruments), where contrasts of register (and the distance between the two hands) may have a striking, quasi orchestral effect.
&quot;Coupling&quot; is when the transferred parts retain a link with their original register. The work, in this case, appears to unfold in two registers in parallel.

===Voice exchange===

Voice exchange is a common device in counterpoint theory. Schenkerians view it as a means of elaborating a chord by modifying its position. Two voices exchange their notes, often with passing notes in between. At the end of the example of Beethoven&#x27;s Op. 109 above, the bass and soprano exchange their notes: G is transferred from bass to soprano, while E is transferred from soprano to bass. The exchange is marked by crossed lines between these notes.

==Elaboration of the fundamental structure==
The elaborations of the fundamental structure deserve a specific discussion because they may determine the form of the work in which they occur.

===Initial ascent, initial arpeggiation===

The starting point of the fundamental line, its &quot;head note&quot; (&quot;Kopfton&quot;), may be reached only after an ascending motion, either an initial ascending line (&quot;Anstieg&quot;) or an initial arpeggiation, which may take more extension than the descending fundamental line itself. This results in melodies in arch form. Schenker decided only in 1930 that the fundamental line should be descending: in his earlier analyses, initial ascending lines often are described as being part of the &quot;Urlinie&quot; itself.

===First-order neighbor note===
Schenker stresses that the head note of the fundamental line often is decorated by a neighbor note &quot;of the first order&quot;, which must be an upper neighbor because &quot;the lower neighboring note would give the impression of the interruption&quot;. The neighbor note of the first order is –– or ––: the harmony supporting it often is the IVth or VIth degree, which may give rise to a section of the work at the subdominant.

===Articulation of the span from I to V in the bass arpeggiation===
The canonic form of the bass arpeggiation is I–V–I. The second interval, V–I, forms under – the perfect authentic cadence and is not susceptible of elaboration at the background level. The first span, I–V, on the other hand, usually is elaborated. The main cases include:

====I–III–V====
This is the complete arpeggiation of the triad. Once elaborated, it may consist in a succession of three tonalities, especially in pieces in minor. In these cases, III stands for a tonicisation of the major relative. This often occurs in Sonata forms in minor, where the first thematic group elaborates degree I, the second thematic group is in the major relative, degree III, and the development leads to V before the recapitulation in the tonic key.

====I–IV–V or I–II–V====
Even though he never discussed them at length, these elaborations occupy a very special place in Schenker&#x27;s theory. One might even argue that no description of an &quot;Ursatz&quot; properly speaking is complete if it does not include IV or II at the background level. Schenker uses a special sign to denote this situation, the double curve shown in the example hereby, crossing the slur that links IV (or II) to V. That IV (here, F) is written as a quarter note indicates that it is of lower rank than I and V, notated as half notes. Here there is an unexpected link between Schenkerian theory and Riemann&#x27;s theory of tonal functions, a fact that might explain Schenker&#x27;s reluctance to be more explicit about it. In modern Schenkerian analysis, the chord of IV or II is often dubbed the &quot;predominant&quot; chord, as the chord that prepares the dominant one, and the progression may be labelled &quot;T–P–D–T&quot;, for tonic–predominant–dominant–tonic.

====I–II–III–IV–V====
The dominant chord may be linked to the tonic by a stepwise linear progression. In such case, one of the chords in the progression, II, III or IV, usually takes preeminence, reducing the case to one or the other described above.

===Interruption===
The interruption (&quot;Unterbrechung&quot;) is an elaboration of the fundamental line, which is interrupted at its last passing note, , before it reaches its goal. As a result, the bass arpeggiation itself is also interrupted at the divider at the fifth (V). Both the fundamental line and the bass arpeggiation are bound to return to their starting point and the fundamental structure repeats itself, eventually reaching its goal. The interruption is the main form-generating elaboration: it often is used in binary forms (when the first part ends on the dominant) or, if the elaboration of the &quot;dividing dominant&quot;, above V, takes some importance, it may produce ternary form, typically sonata form.

===Mixture===
Schenker calls &quot;mixture&quot; (&quot;Mischung&quot;) the change of mode of the tonic, i.e. the replacement of its major third by the minor one, or of its minor third by the major one. The elaboration of the resulting chord may give rise to a section in minor within a work in major, or the reverse.

===Transference of the fundamental structure===
The forms of the fundamental structure may be repeated at any level of the work. &quot;Every transferred form [of the fundamental structure] has the effect of a self-contained structure within which the upper and lower voices delimit a single tonal space&quot;. That is to say that any phrase in a work could take the form of a complete fundamental structure. Many classical themes (e.g. the theme to the set of variations in Mozart&#x27;s K. 331 piano sonata) form self-contained structure of this type. This resemblance of local middleground structures to background structures is part of the beauty and appeal of Schenkerian analysis, giving it the appearance of a recursive construction.

==Legacy and responses==

===Europe before World War II===
Schenker himself mentioned in a letter of 1927 to his student Felix-Eberhard von Cube that his ideas continued &quot;to be felt more widely: Edinburgh [with John Petrie Dunn], (also New York [probably with George Wedge]), Leipzig [with Reinhard Oppel], Stuttgart [with Herman Roth], Vienna (myself and [Hans] Weisse), [Otto] Vrieslander in Munich […], yourself [von Cube] in Duisburg, and [August] Halm [in Wickersdorf, Thuringia].&quot; Von Cube, with Moritz Violin, another of Schenker&#x27;s students, founded the &quot;Schenker Institut&quot; in Hamburg in 1931. Oswald Jonas published &quot;Das Wesen des musikalischen Kunstwerkes&quot; in 1932, and Felix Salzer &quot;Sinn und Wesen des Abendländischen Mehrstimmigkeits&quot; in 1935, both based on Schenkerian concepts. Oswald Jonas and Felix Salzer founded and edited together the short-lived Schenkerian journal &quot;Der Dreiklang&quot; (Vienna, 1937–1938).

World War II brought European studies to a halt. Schenker&#x27;s publications were placed under Nazi ban and some were confiscated by the Gestapo. It is in the United States that Schenkerian analysis knew its first important developments. This history has been contextualized by comments on both sides of the Atlantic, notably by Martin Eybl and Philip A. Ewell.

===Early reception in the US===
George Wedge taught some of Schenker&#x27;s ideas as early as 1925 in the Institute of Musical Arts, New York. Victor Vaughn Lytle, who had studied with Hans Weisse in Vienna, wrote what may be the earliest English-language essay dealing with Schenkerian concepts, &quot;Music Composition of the Present&quot; (&quot;The American Organist&quot;, 1931), without however really crediting Schenker for them. Weisse himself, who had studied with Schenker at least from 1912, immigrated to the United States and began teaching Schenkerian analysis at the Mannes School of Music in New York in 1931. One of his students, Adele T. Katz, devoted an article to &quot;Heinrich Schenker&#x27;s Method of Analysis&quot; in 1935, then an important book, &quot;Challenge to Musical Tradition&quot;, in 1945, in which she applied Schenkerian analytical concepts not only to some of Schenker&#x27;s favorite composers, Johann Sebastian and Philipp Emmanuel Bach, Haydn and Beethoven, but also to Wagner, Debussy, Stravinsky and Schoenberg: this certainly represents one of the earliest attempts to widen the corpus of Schenkerian analysis.

The opinions of the critics were not always positive, however. Roger Sessions published in &quot;Modern Music&quot; 12 (May–June 1935) an obituary article under the title &quot;Heinrich Schenker&#x27;s Contribution&quot; where, after having recognized some of Schenker&#x27;s achievements, he criticizes the development of the last years, until &quot;Der freie Satz&quot; (which he admits is not yet available in the US) and concludes that &quot;It is precisely when Schenker&#x27;s teachings leave the domain of exact description and enter that of dogmatic and speculative analysis that they become essentially sterile&quot;. The most raging attack against Schenker came in the &quot;Editorial&quot; that Paul Henry Lang devoted in &quot;The Musical Quarterly&quot; 32/2 (April 1946) to the recently published book by Adele Katz, &quot;Challenge to Musical Tradition&quot;, which he opposed to Donald Tovey&#x27;s &quot;Beethoven&quot;, also published in 1945; his attacks also target Schenker&#x27;s followers, probably the American ones. He writes:
Schenker&#x27;s and his disciples&#x27; musical theory and philosophy is not art, its whole outlook – at least as expressed in their writings – lacks feeling. There was seldom a colder spirit than theirs; the only warmth one feels is the warmth of dogmatism. Music interests them only insofar as it fits into their system ... In reality music serves only to furnish grist for the mill of their insatiable theoretical mind, not for their heart or imagination. There is no art, no poetry, in this remarkable system which deals with the raw materials of music with a virtuoso hand. Schenker and his disciples play with music as others play chess, not even suspecting what fantasy, what sentimental whirlpools lie at the bottom of every composition. They see lines only, no colors, and their ideas are cold and orderly. But music is color and warmth, which are the values of a concrete art.

===After World War II===

====Translations====
Schenker left about 4000 pages of printed text, of which the translations at first were astonishingly slow. Nearly all have been translated into English, and the project Schenker Documents Online is busy with the edition and translation of more than 100 000 manuscript pages. Translations in other languages remain slow.

<text>Bogotá (, , , ), officially Bogotá, Distrito Capital, abbreviated Bogotá, D.C., and formerly known as Santa Fe de Bogotá (; ) during the Spanish Colonial period and between 1991 and 2000, is the capital and largest city of Colombia, and one of the largest cities in the world. The city is administered as the Capital District, as well as the capital of, though not politically part of, the surrounding department of Cundinamarca. Bogotá is a territorial entity of the first order, with the same administrative status as the departments of Colombia. It is the main political, economic, administrative, industrial, cultural, aeronautical, technological, scientific, medical and educational center of the country and northern South America.

Bogotá was founded as the capital of the New Kingdom of Granada on 6 August 1538 by Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada after a harsh expedition into the Andes conquering the Muisca, the indigenous inhabitants of the Altiplano. Santafé (its name after 1540) became the seat of the government of the Spanish Royal Audiencia of the New Kingdom of Granada (created in 1550), and then after 1717 it was the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. After the Battle of Boyacá on 7 August 1819, Bogotá became the capital of the independent nation of Gran Colombia. It was Simón Bolívar who rebaptized the city with the name of Bogotá, as a way of honoring the Muisca people and as an emancipation act towards the Spanish crown. Hence, since the Viceroyalty of New Granada&#x27;s independence from the Spanish Empire and during the formation of present-day Colombia, Bogotá has remained the capital of this territory.
The city is located in the center of Colombia, on a high plateau known as the Bogotá savanna, part of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense located in the Eastern Cordillera of the Andes. Its altitude averages above sea level. Subdivided into 20 localities, Bogotá has an area of and a cool climate that is constant through the year.
The city is home to central offices of the executive branch (Office of the President), the legislative branch (Congress of Colombia) and the judicial branch (Supreme Court of Justice, Constitutional Court, Council of State and the Superior Council of Judicature) of the Colombian government. Bogotá stands out for its economic strength and associated financial maturity, its attractiveness to global companies and the quality of human capital. It is the financial and commercial heart of Colombia, with the most business activity of any city in the country. The capital hosts the main financial market in Colombia and the Andean natural region, and is the leading destination for new foreign direct investment projects coming into Latin America and Colombia. It has the highest nominal GDP in the country, responsible for almost a quarter of the nation&#x27;s total (24.7%).
The city&#x27;s airport, El Dorado International Airport, named after the mythical &quot;El Dorado&quot;, handles the largest cargo volume in Latin America, and is third in number of passengers. Bogotá is home to the largest number of universities and research centers in the country, and is an important cultural center, with many theaters, libraries (Virgilio Barco, Tintal, and Tunal of BibloRed, BLAA, National Library, among more than 1000) and museums. Bogotá ranks 52nd on the Global Cities Index 2014, and is considered a global city type &quot;Alpha-&quot; by GaWC.

== Toponymy ==
The name of Bogotá corresponds to the Spanish pronunciation of the Chibcha &quot;Bacatá&quot; (or Muyquytá) which was the name of a neighboring settlement located between the modern towns of Funza and Cota. There are different opinions about the meaning of the word Muyquytá, the most accepted being that it means &quot;walling of the farmland&quot; in the Chibcha language. Another popular translation argues that it means &quot;The Lady of the Andes&quot;. Others suggest that Bacatá was the name of the Muisca cacique who governed the land before the Spaniards arrived. Jiménez de Quesada gave the settlement the name of &quot;Our Lady of Hope&quot; but the Spanish crown gave it the name of Santafé (Holy Faith) in 1540 when it was appointed as a city. The Muisca, the indigenous inhabitants of the region, called the place on which the city was founded &quot;Thybzaca&quot; or &quot;Old Town&quot;.

== History ==
The area of modern Bogotá was first populated by groups of indigenous people who migrated south based on the relation with the other Chibcha languages; the Bogotá savanna was the southernmost Chibcha-speaking group that exists from Nicaragua to the Andes in Colombia. The civilization built by the Muisca, who settled in the valleys and fertile highlands of and surrounding the Altiplano Cundiboyacense (modern-day departments of Cundinamarca and Boyacá and small parts of Santander), was one of the great civilizations in the Americas. The name Muisca Confederation has been given to a loose egalitarian society of various chiefs (&quot;caciques&quot;) who lived in small settlements of maximum 100 &quot;bohíos&quot;. The agriculture and salt-based society of the people was rich in goldworking, trade and mummification. The religion of the Muisca consisted of various gods, mostly related to natural phenomena as the Sun (Sué) and his wife, the Moon; Chía, rain Chibchacum, rainbow Cuchavira and with building and feasting (Nencatacoa) and wisdom (Bochica). Their complex luni-solar calendar, deciphered by Manuel Izquierdo based on work by Duquesne, followed three different sets of years, where the sidereal and synodic months were represented. Their astronomical knowledge is represented in one of the few extant landmarks of the architecture of the Muisca in &quot;El Infiernito&quot; outside Villa de Leyva to the north of Bogotá.

=== Pre-Columbian era ===

The first populations inhabiting the present-day Metropolitan Area of Bogotá were hunter-gatherers in the late Pleistocene. Dating to around 12,500 BP, the oldest evidence of human activity was discovered in &quot;El Abra,&quot; north of Zipaquirá. Other excavations in a rock shelter southwest of the city in Soacha provided ages of ~11,000 BP; Tequendama. Since roughly 0 AD, the local Muisca people domesticated guinea pigs as a source of dietary meat. The people inhabiting the Bogotá savanna in the late 15th century were the Muisca, speaking &quot;Muysccubun&quot;, a member of the Chibcha language family. Muisca means &quot;people&quot; or &quot;person&quot;, making &quot;Muisca people&quot;, how they are called, a tautology. At the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores, the Muisca population was estimated to be half a million indigenous people on the Bogotá savanna, and up to two million in the Muisca Confederation. They occupied the highland and mild climate flanks between the Sumapaz Mountains to the southwest and Cocuy&#x27;s snowy peak to the northeast, covering an approximate area of , comprising Bogotá&#x27;s high plain, a large portion of the modern-day department of Boyacá department portion and a small area in the Santander region.

Trade was the most important activity of the Muisca with other Chibcha-speaking neighbours, such as the Guane, Lache and U&#x27;wa and with Cariban-speaking groups such as the Muzo or &quot;Emerald People&quot;. Their knowledge of salt production from brines, a task devoted exclusively to Muisca women, gave them the name of &quot;Salt People&quot;. Tropical fruits that did not grow on the cool highlands, as well as coca, cotton and gold were all traded at markets that took place every Muisca week; every four days. At these frequent markets, the Muisca obtained various luxury goods that appear worthless in a modern sense, as well as precious metals and gemstones that seem valuable to us and which became abundant and were used for various purposes. The Muisca warrior elite were allowed to wear feathered crowns, from parrots and macaws whose habitat was to the east of the Andes; the Arawakan-speaking Guayupe, Tegua and Achagua.

The Muisca cuisine consisted of a stable and varied diet of tubers, potatoes and fruits. Maize was the main ingredient of the Muisca, cultivated on elevated and irrigated terraces. Many words exist in Muysccubun for &quot;maize&quot;, &quot;corn&quot; and the various types and forms of it. The product was also the base for chicha; the alcoholic beverage of the people, still sold in central Bogotá today. It was the beverage used to celebrate the construction of houses, harvests and sowing, ritual practices around the various sacred sites of the Altiplano, music and dances, trade at special fairs with farther away trading indigenous groups of Colombia and to inaugurate the new highest regarded member of the community; &quot;zipas&quot;, &quot;zaques&quot;, &quot;caciques&quot; and the religious ruler &quot;iraca&quot; from Sacred City of the Sun Sugamuxi.

=== Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada expedition and Spanish conquest ===

From 1533, a belief persisted that the Río Grande de la Magdalena was the trail to the South Sea, to Peru, legendary &quot;El Dorado&quot;. Such was the target of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, the Granadanian conquistador who left Santa Marta on 6 April 1536 with 800 soldiers, heading towards the interior of current Colombia. The expedition divided into two groups, one under Quesada&#x27;s command to move on land, and the other commanded by Diego de Urbino would go upriver in four brigantine ships to eventually meet Quesada&#x27;s troops at the site named Tora de las Barrancas Bermejas. When they arrived, they heard news about Indians inhabiting the south and making large salt cakes used to trade for wild cotton and fish. Jiménez de Quesada decided to abandon the route to Peru and cross the mountain in search of salt villages. They saw crops, trails, white salt cakes and then huts where they found corn, yucca and beans. From Tora, the expedition went up the Opón River and found indigenous people wearing very finely painted cotton mantles. When they arrived in Muisca territories in the Andean Plateau, on 9 March 1537, of the expedition leaving Santa Marta, only 162 men were left.

The &quot;zipa&quot; at the moment of Spanish conquest was Tisquesusa. His main &quot;bohío&quot; was in a small village called &quot;Bacatá&quot; with others in Funza and Cajicá, giving name to the present day capital of Colombia. &quot;Bacatá&quot; was actually located near to the modern location of the city of Funza. A prophecy in his life came true; &quot;he would be dying, bathing in his own blood&quot;. Defending Funza with a reduced army of guecha warriors against the heavily exhausted but heavily armed strangers, his reign fell in the hands of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada and his younger brother Hernán Pérez on 20 April 1537. Upon his death, his brother Sagipa became the last &quot;zipa&quot;, against the inheritance tradition of the Muisca. Sagipa used to be a main captain for Tisquesusa but quickly submitted to the Spanish rulers. The first encomenderos asked high prices in valuable products and agricultural production from the indigenous people. On top of that epidemics of European viruses razed through the population, of which in current Boyacá 65–85 % of the Muisca were killed within 100 years.

Jiménez de Quesada decided to establish a military campament in the area in 1538, in the site today known as the Chorro de Quevedo square. The foundation was performed by the construction of 12 houses of reed, referring to the Twelve Apostles, and the construction of a preliminary church, also of reed. With the celebration of the first mass in the campament, celebrated by Dominican friar the city was founded with the name of Nuestra Señora de la Esperanza (Our Lady of Hope) on 6 August 1538. Quesada placed his right foot on the bare earth and said simply, &quot;I take possession of this land in the name of the most sovereign emperor, Charles V.&quot;
This founding, however, was irregular as no town council was formed nor were town officials appointed, as well as lacking some other juridical requirements for an official founding. As a consequence, the official founding only occurred about eight months later, on 27 April 1539, in a site close to one of the recreational lands of the &quot;zipa&quot;, called Theusa or Theusaquillo. This official founding involved an official ceremony appointing a council and officials, and the demarcation of streets and lands, and in it fellow conquistadores Sebastián de Belalcázar and Nikolaus Federmann were present. While this was the official date of founding, traditionally it is the 6 August 1538 that is considered the date of the actual foundation.

The village obtained the title of City by way of a decree from Charles V on 27 July 1540, which changed the name of the city from Our Lady of Hope to Santa Fe (Holy Faith), after the name of a town nearby Granada where Jiménez de Quesada grew up. Jiménez de Quesada and conquerors De Belalcázar and Federmann left for Spain in April 1539, founding Guataquí together on 6 April 1539. The rule over the newly created New Kingdom of Granada was left to Jiménez de Quesada&#x27;s brother, Hernán Pérez de Quesada. The first mayors of the city were captains Pedro de Arevalo andJeronimo de Inzar. The city obtained the Title of Muy Noble y Muy Leal (Very Noble and Loyal) on 17 August 1575 by a decree from Phillip II. Bogotá, then called Santa Fe, later became the capital of the later Viceroyalty of New Granada. Following the independence from Spain, Bogotá became capital of Gran Colombia and later the capital of the Republic of Colombia.

=== Spanish colonization ===
The city mayor and the chapter formed by two councilmen, assisted by the constable and the police chief, governed the city. For better administration of these domains, in April 1550, the Audiencia of Santafé was organized. Santa Fe (or Santafé) became the seat of the government of the New Kingdom of Granada . Fourteen years later in 1564, the Spanish Crown designated the first Royal Audiencia chairman, Andrés Díaz Venero de Leyva. The Chapter and the Royal Audience were located on the other side of what is today the Plaza de Bolívar (then called, Plaza Mayor or Major Square). The street connecting the Major Square and the Square of Herbs— now Santander Park— was named &quot;Calle Real&quot; (Royal Street), now &quot;Carrera Séptima&quot; (or &quot;Seventh Street&quot;; counted from the mountains to the east of the city). After 1717 Santafé became the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada.

Formed by Europeans, mestizos, indigenous people, and slaves, from the second half of the 16th century, the population began to grow rapidly. The 1789 census recorded 18,161 inhabitants, and by 1819 the city population reached 30,000 inhabitants distributed in 195 blocks. Importance grew when the diocese was established.

=== Nineteenth century ===

Political unease over the Spanish monarchy and the rights of citizens born in the Americas had been felt throughout the Spanish colonies in America, and it was expressed in New Granada in many different ways, accelerating the movement to independence. One of the most transcendent was the Insurrection of the Comuneros, a riot by the locals that started in Villa del Socorro —current Department of Santander—in March 1781. Spanish authorities suppressed the riot, and José Antonio Galán, the leader, was executed. He left an imprint, though. One of the soldiers witnessing his execution was an intellectually curious, noble teenager named Antonio Nariño, who was deeply impressed by both the insurrection and the execution. Nariño went on to become a politician in Santafé, and he became acquainted with the liberal ideas in vogue in Europe. He started organizing clandestine meetings with other intellectuals and politicians to discuss and promote the independence of the American colonies from the Spanish crown. In 1794, Nariño clandestinely translated and published in Santa Fe the Declaration of the Rights of Men and of the Citizen, and copies of his translation were distributed all over the continent and started creating a stirring in the political mentalities of the time. The Spanish government had banned the distribution of the pamphlet and soon discovered the material and burned any copy that they could find. Nariño was arrested on 29 August 1794, and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and to have all of his properties confiscated, and was sent to exile the year after. Those suspected of being part of Nariño&#x27;s intellectual circle were also persecuted, but his ideas had become widespread.

In 1807, following the French invasion of Spain and the subsequent abdication of the House of Bourbon in Spain, pressed by Napoleon to give the crown to his brother Joseph, resulting in the destruction of the Spanish administration, many in Spain and in the American colonies created local resistance governments called Juntas. The dissolution of the Supreme Central Junta, following a series of military defeats in the Spanish troops, promoted the creation of local juntas all throughout Latin America, which very soon consolidated the independentist ideas already in vogue. After the establishment of a junta in Cartagena de Indias on 22 May 1810, and in many other cities throughout the Viceroyalty, the Junta de Santa Fe was established on 20 July 1810, in what is often called the Colombian Declaration of Independence. The Junta adopted the name of &quot;Supreme Junta of the New Kingdom of Granada&quot;, and first swore allegiance to Viceroy Antonio José Amar y Borbón, and appointed him as president, but then he was deposed and arrested five days later. After declaring independence from Spain the different juntas attempted to establish a congress of provinces, but they were unable to do so and military conflicts soon emerged.

The period between 1810 and 1816 was marked by intense conflict between federalist and centralist factions over the nature of the new government of the recently emancipated juntas, a period that has become known as &quot;la Patria Boba&quot;. The Province of Santafé became the Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca, which soon became embroiled in a civil war against other local juntas which banded together to form the United Provinces of New Granada and advocated for a federalist government system. Following a failed military campaign against Quito, General Simón Bolívar of the United Provinces led a campaign that led to the surrender of the Cundinamarca province in December 1814.

In Spain, the war had ended and the Spanish monarchy was restored on 11 December 1813. King Ferdinand VII of Spain declared the uprisings in the colonies illegal and sent a large army to quell the rebellions and reconquer the lost colonies, for which he appointed General Pablo Morillo. Morillo led a successful military campaign that culminated in the capture of Santafé on 6 May 1816.

In 1819, Bolívar initiated his campaign to liberate New Granada. Following a series of battles, the last of which was the Battle of Boyacá, the republican army led by Bolívar cleared its way to Santafé, where he arrived victorious on 10 August 1819. It was Simón Bolívar who rebaptized the city with the name of Bogotá, to honor the Muisca people and to emphasize the emancipation from Spain. Bogotá then became the capital of the Gran Colombia.

Between 1819 and 1849, there were no fundamental structural changes from the colonial period. By the mid-19th century, a series of fundamental reforms were enacted, some of the most important being slavery abolition and religious, teaching, print and speech industry and trade freedom, among others. During the decade of the 70s, radicalism accelerated reforms and state and social institutions were substantially modified. However, during the second half of the century, the country faced permanent pronouncements, declarations of rebellions between states, and factions which resulted in civil wars: the last and bloodiest was the Thousand Days&#x27; War from 1899 to 1902. 

In 1823, a few years after the formation of Gran Colombia, the Public Library, now the National Library, was enlarged and modernized with new volumes and better facilities. The National Museum was founded. Those institutions were of great importance to the new republic&#x27;s cultural development. The Central University was the first State school, precursor of the current National University, founded in 1867 and domiciled in Bogotá.

=== Regeneration ===
President Rafael Núñez declared the end of Federalism, and in 1886 the country became a centralist republic ruled by the constitution in force – save some amendments – up to 1991. In the middle of political and administration avatars, Bogotá continued as the capital and principal political center of the country.

From a base of only 20,000 people in 1793, the city grew to approximately 117,000 people in 1912. Population growth was rapid after 1870, largely because of emigration from the eastern highlands.

=== Twentieth century ===

Early in the 20th century, Colombia had to face devastating consequences from the One Thousand Days War, which lasted from 1899 to 1902, and the loss of Panama. Between 1904 and 1909, the lawfulness of the liberal party was re-established and President Rafael Reyes endeavored to implement a national government. Peace and state reorganization generated the increase of economic activities. Bogotá started deep architectural and urban transformation with significant industrial and artisan production increases. In 1910, the Industrial Exposition of the Century took place at Park of Independence. Stands built evidenced industrial, artisan work, beaux arts, electricity and machinery progress achieved. The period from 1910 to 1930 is designated conservative hegemony. Between 1924 and 1928, hard union struggles began, with oil fields and banana zone workers&#x27; strikes, leaving numerous people dead.

Bogotá had practically no industry. Production was basically artisan work grouped in specific places, similar to commercial sectors. Plaza de Bolívar and surroundings lodged hat stores, at Calle del Comercio –current Carrera Seventh– and Calle Florián –now Carrera Eight– luxurious stores selling imported products opened their doors; at Pasaje Hernández, tailor&#x27;s shops provided their services, and between 1870 and 1883, four main banks opened their doors: Bogotá, Colombia, Popular and Mortgage Credit banks.

Following the banana zone killings and conservative party division, Enrique Olaya Herrera took office in 1930. The liberal party reformed during 16 years of the so-called Liberal Republic, agricultural, social, political, labor, educational, economic and administrative sectors. Unionism strengthened and education coverage expanded. 

The celebration produced a large number of infrastructure works, new construction and work sources. Following the 1946 liberal party division, a conservative candidate took presidential office again in 1948, after the killing of liberal leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, Bogotá&#x27;s downtown was virtually destroyed as violence reigned. From then, Bogotá&#x27;s urban, architectural and population sectors were substantially reorganized.

=== Twenty-first century ===
The city began the 21st century with important changes in its urban space and public transport, looking to plan demographic and economic growth, that would position it as a strategic hub for international business in Latin America. Some of the main interventions initiated looked to develop projects contained in the Plan of Territorial Ordering (POT), which aims to guide the development of the city for the next two centuries.

One of the most important interventions in the city was in its transportation system. In 1967, there were 2,679 urban buses in Bogotá that transported, on average, 1,630,000 passengers per day. The city had about 1 million inhabitants and 80 km2 of area, the service was relatively reasonable. But as the city grew and reached more than five million and an area greater than 300 km2, not only did the car fleet increase substantially to more than 20,000 vehicles, but traffic complexity increased, as well as pollution and the inefficiency of the only existing transportation system.

By the end of the 20th century, the situation was difficult. There was no real urban public transport system that would serve as an alternative to the private vehicle – which further incentivized its use – and the city had low levels of competitiveness in Latin America, as well as an unsatisfactory quality of life for the vast majority of its inhabitants. The administrations of mayors Andrés Pastrana (1988–90) and Jaime Castro (1992–94), in addition to the first of Antanas Mockus (1995–97), formulated proposals to solve the problem of public transport, with limited results. It was during the mayoralty of the latter when there was talk about the possibility of establishing a mass transportation system that would help remedy the problem of mobility.

Under the second administration of Antanas Mockus, Bogotá opened a &#x27;zone of tolerancia&#x27; which legalized prostitution in a large swath of the center of the city in the Santa Fe neighborhood.

Mayor Enrique Peñalosa (whose first term was 1998–2000) included in his program as a priority a solution to public transport. Consequently, in the execution of the development plan &quot;For the Bogotá we Want&quot; in terms of mobility and in a mass transportation system project, the construction of special infrastructure exclusively for its operation was determined. This system would include specialized bus corridors, equipped with single-use lanes, stations, bridges, bike paths and special pedestrian access platforms, designed to facilitate the user&#x27;s experience in the system. However, Peñalosa became infamous for his campaign against the poor, saying he would rather see robbers on the streets, than people selling candies. Peñalosa served a second term (2016–19).

After getting elected in 2011, Gustavo Petro, clashed with the conservative political establishment after remunicipalization of the city&#x27;s garbage collection system. The inspector general, Alejandro Ordoñez deposed Petro for alleged constitutional overreach when he tried to replace the city&#x27;s private trash collectors. Petro was reinstated weeks later after a Bogotá court ruled that Ordoñez had overstepped his authority.

Although the proposal for biarticulated diesel buses called &quot;Transmilenio&quot; was in its early stages a success, due in part to the small numbers of passengers it transported, in the long term it became an inefficient and contaminating system, saturated for a metro population of almost ten million, guilty of environmental deterioration and air pollution.

For its part, the cultural equipment plan of Bogotá has yielded significant results, including the construction of three large public libraries in different sectors. These libraries have not only expanded access to existing library resources but also serve as some of the 150 hubs for BibloRed - Bogotá&#x27;s Public Libraries Network, including the Bogota Digital Library The new libraries were located in sectors that allow a wide coverage, have easy access by public transport and bike paths; and their projects were commissioned to distinguished architects of the city. They are those of El Tunal, in the south, projected by the architect Suely Vargas; of El Tintal, in the west, the work of the architect Daniel Bermúdez; and the Virgilio Barco Vargas library, located in the Simón Bolívar park in the central area, work of the architect Rogelio Salmona. Out of the city&#x27;s 150 libraries, these three, with their outstanding architecture, provide public and open-access spaces for the educational and cultural development of the citizens of Bogotá.

As for 2019, the city&#x27;s distribution is composed of nine main business centers (Av. El Dorado Business Corridor, Centro Internacional, Parque de la 93, El Lago, North Point, Calle 100, Santa Barbara Business Center, Zona Industrial Montevideo &amp; Parque Industrial Zona Franca). Grittier sides sit south and southwest, where working-class barrios continue to battle their reputations for drugs and crime. In the ritzier north you&#x27;ll find boutique hotels, corporate offices and well-heeled locals piling into chic entertainment districts such as the Zona Rosa and Zona G.

Protests against police brutality started in Bogotá following the death of Javier Ordóñez while in police custody on 9 September 2020. , 13 people have died and over 400 have been injured as part of the protests.

== Geography ==

Bogotá is located in the southeastern part of the Bogotá savanna (&quot;Sabana de Bogotá&quot;) at an average altitude of above sea level. The Bogotá savanna is popularly called &quot;savannah&quot; (&quot;sabana&quot;), but constitutes actually a high plateau in the Andes mountains, part of an extended region known as the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, which literally means &quot;high plateau of Cundinamarca and Boyacá&quot;. Bogotá is the largest city in the world at its elevation; there is no urban area that is both higher and more populous than Bogotá.

In the extreme south of Bogotá&#x27;s District, the world&#x27;s largest continuous paramo ecosystem can be found; Sumapaz Páramo in the locality Sumapaz. The Bogotá River running NE-SW crosses the &quot;sabana&quot;, forming Tequendama Falls (&quot;Salto del Tequendama&quot;) to the south. Tributary rivers form valleys with villages, whose economy is based on agriculture, livestock raising and artisanal production.

The &quot;sabana&quot; is bordered to the east by the Eastern Cordillera of the Andes mountain range. The Eastern Hills, which limit city growth, run from south to north, forming east of the downtown the Guadalupe and Monserrate mountains. The western city limit is Bogotá River. The Sumapaz Paramo (moorland) borders the south and to the north Bogotá extends over the plateau up to the towns of Chía and Sopó.

Most of the wetlands in the Bogotá region have disappeared. They covered nearly 50,000 hectares in the 1960s, compared to only 727 in 2019, for a disappearance rate of 98%.

=== Climate ===
Bogotá has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot; bordering on &quot;Csb&quot;). The average temperature is , varying from on sunny days to on rainy days. Dry and rainy seasons alternate throughout the year. The driest months are December, January, July and August. The warmest month is March, bringing a maximum of . The coolest nights occur in January, with an average of in the city; fog is very usual in early morning, 220 days per year, whilst clear sky sunny full days are quite unusual.

The official highest temperature recorded within the city limits is , and the lowest temperature recorded is , both at the Guaymaral Airport.

The rainiest months are April, May, September, October, and November, in which typical days are mostly overcast, with low clouds and some winds, bringing maximum temperatures of and lows of .

Because of its low latitude and high altitude, Bogotá has an average of 12 daylight hours and 11+ ultraviolet radiation year-round.

=== Urban layout and nomenclature ===

The colonial city, from 1539 to 1810, barely changed its urban layout and culture. Santafe was slowly leaving behind the colonialism after the independence revolution from 1810 to 1819. Entering the 19th century, the city of Bogotá was still the political and demographic core of Nueva Granada but remained a small city as compared with similar cities, such as Lima and Buenos Aires. At the year of 1801, the city had 173 blocks and 21,394 inhabitants marking a slow population growth during the 18th century. In the beginning of the 19th century, city life was marked by the lack of cultural activity and public services as well as by the excessive Catholic religiosity in its inhabitants, which almost controlled the whole life of people, as a journalist traveler wrote in 1822 (Biblioteca Luis Angel Arango, 1990,2 ).

The city&#x27;s urban shape remained the same in the 19th century as the 1557 urban landscape as a checkerboard with the Plaza as its core. In other words, the city grew in area adding new square blocks but kept the same urban fabric. Buildings were low rise, as a traveler wrote in 1830 (Bibliotheca Luis Angel Arango, 1990,2), where most city buildings had one floor, and a few had no more than two. One special characteristic of those houses with two floors, which were the houses of the wealthiest families of Bogotá, were their balconies. The building facades of Bogotá were very simplistic without ornaments, meaning no more than a wall with windows and the entry door. However, due to the poor street conditions because of the potholes and waste, in addition to the lack of cultural and social activity at night, the ornaments were reserved to indoors where Bogotanos spent most of their time. One of the few outdoor activities of the people of Bogotá during the first half of the 19th century was going to the Plaza or the &quot;altozano&quot; as the locals called it. The Plaza was the social core of the city, where fresh fruits were sold and where inhabitants from all socioeconomic backgrounds converged (Bibliotheca Luis Angel Arango, 1990,2).

The landscape of Bogotá was very similar from the 16th century to 19th century. Nonetheless, after the milestone fact of the independence from the Spanish, which was a process that lasted at least ten years from 1810 to 1819, some changes started to happen. Those changes were happening slowly while the new republican order was getting power. Trying to make a difference from the colonial ages, the new Republic began changing the name of the plazas, streets and even the name of the city, from Santafe to Bogotá. The names of colonial streets were changed to numbers and the name of plazas were changed to the founding fathers of Colombia. Thereafter, the empty plazas of the colonial ages turned into ornamented plazas with plenty of trees and civic statues. For instance, the first civil statue placed in a plaza in Colombia was the figure of Bolivar, the main founding father of Colombia. The statue of Bolivar was unveiled on July 20, 1846, which is the Independence Day of Colombia, trying to strengthen the patriotism of the new republic in people of Bogotá and Colombia.

The last quarter of the 19th century, from 1870 to 1900, more clearly marked a new urban landscape of Bogotá. The constant rural migration to Bogotá had been one of the most important factors that allowed the city to maintain its influential power in the region both during the colonial ages and during the republic. In 1847, the city governor and the council tried to expand the urban area of Bogotá beyond the colonial limits, whereas, only until the 1860s was that expansion encouraged by the president of Colombia Tomas Cipriano de Mosquera. The Mosquera plan included lotting the western part of Bogotá, building bridges and wider roads and plazas, but that plan was only partially implemented. In the following decade, other urban initiatives emerged but this time from the private sector. A group of businessmen, tired of the city&#x27;s slow growth and development, proposed the construction of sewars, theaters, electric systems and new roads in order to hasten the development of Bogotá. Because of the 1876 civil war, the plan could not be implemented, but from that initiative, the council adopted the first urban code of Bogotá in 1875. These initiatives tried to update the undeveloped city to the new technologies of the 1800s; however, the pace remained slow, and only after 1882, when the train and the trolley came to Bogotá, some urban development projects progressed more quickly.

Today Bogotá has 20 localities, or districts, forming an extensive network of neighborhoods. Areas of higher economic status tend to be located in the north, close to the Eastern Hills in the districts of Chapinero, Usaquén and the east of Suba. The lower middle class inhabit the central, western and northwestern parts of the city.. The working-class neighborhoods are located in the south, some of them squatter areas.
The urban layout in the center of the city is based on the focal point of a square or plaza, typical of Spanish-founded settlements, but the layout gradually becomes more modern in outlying neighborhoods. The types of roads are classified as &quot;Calles&quot; (streets), which run from west to east horizontally, with street numbers increasing towards the north, and also towards the south (with the suffix &quot;Sur&quot;) from Calle 0 down south. &quot;Carreras&quot; (roads) run from north to south vertically, with numbering increasing from east to west. (with the suffix &quot;Este&quot; for roads east of Carrera 0). At the southeast of the city, the addresses are logically &quot;sur-este&quot;. Other types of roads more common in newer parts of the city may be termed &quot;Eje&quot; (Axis), &quot;Diagonal&quot; or &quot;Transversal&quot;.
The numbering system for street addresses recently changed, and numbers are assigned according to street rank from main avenues to smaller avenues and local streets. Some of Bogotá&#x27;s main roads, which also go by a proper name in addition to a number, are:
* Norte-Quito-Sur or NQS (North Quito South Avenue, from 9th Rd at north following railway to 30th Rd, or Quito City Avenue, and Southern Highway)
* Autopista Norte-Avenida Caracas (Northern Highway, or 45th Rd, joined to Caracas Avenue, or 14th Rd)
* Avenida Circunvalar (or 1st Rd)
* Avenida Suba (60th transversal from 100th St the Suba Hills; 145th St from Suba Hills westward)
* Avenida El Dorado (El Dorado Avenue, or 26th St)
* Avenida de las Américas (Avenue of the Americas, from 34th street at east to 6th street at west)
* Avenida Primero de Mayo (May First Avenue, or 22nd St South)
* Avenida Ciudad de Cali (Cali City Avenue, or 86th Rd)
* Avenida Boyacá (Boyacá Avenue, or 72nd Rd)
* Autopista Sur (Southern Highway)

== Demographics ==

The largest and most populous city in Colombia, Bogotá had 7,412,566 inhabitants within the city&#x27;s limits (2018 census), with a population density of approximately 4,310 inhabitants per square kilometer. Only 25,166 people are located in rural areas of Capital District. 47.8% of the population are male and 52.2% women.

In Bogotá, as in the rest of the country, urbanization has accelerated due to industrialization as well as complex political and social reasons such as poverty and violence, which led to migration from rural to urban areas throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. A dramatic example of this is the number of displaced people who have arrived in Bogotá due to the internal armed conflict.

Some estimates show that Bogotá&#x27;s floating population may be as high as 4 million people, most of them being migrant workers from other departments and displaced people. The majority of the displaced population lives in the Ciudad Bolívar, Kennedy, Usme, and Bosa sections.

=== Vital statistics ===

In 2022 13,28% of births were to foreign mothers.


=== Total fertility rate (TFR) by locality ===
===Ethnic groups===

The ethnic composition of the city&#x27;s population includes minorities of Afro-Colombian people (0.9%), and Indigenous people (0.3%); 98.8% of the population has no ethnic affiliation, but are Whites and Mestizos.

In Bogotá, the accelerated urbanization process is not exclusively due to industrialization, as there are complex political and social reasons such as poverty and violence, which have motivated migration from the countryside to the city throughout the 20th century, determining an exponential growth of the population in Bogotá and the establishment of misery belts in its surroundings. According to the Consultancy for Human Rights, Codhes, in the period 1999–2005 more than 260,000 displaced people arrived in Bogotá, approximately 3.8% of the total population of Bogotá. The locations where the majority of the displaced population is concentrated are Ciudad Bolivar, Kennedy, Bosa and Usme. 

=== Crime ===
Bogotá has gone to great lengths to change its formerly notorious crime rate and its image with increasing success after being considered in the 1990s to be one of the most violent cities in the world. In 1993 there were 4,352 murders at a rate of 81 per 100,000 people; in 2007, Bogotá suffered 1,401 murders at a rate of 20 per 100,000 inhabitants, and had a further reduction to 14 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2017 (the lowest since 1979). This success was mainly the result of a participatory and integrated security policy, &quot;Comunidad Segura&quot;, that was first adopted in 1995 and continues to be enforced. 1.2 percent of street addresses account for 99 percent of homicides.

== Government ==
Bogotá is the capital of the Republic of Colombia, and houses the Congress, Supreme Court of Justice and the center of the executive administration as well as the residence of the President (Casa de Nariño). These buildings, along with the Office of the Mayor, the Lievano Palace (Palacio Liévano), are located within a few meters from each other on the Bolívar Square (Plaza de Bolívar). The square is located in the city&#x27;s historical center, La Candelaria, which features architecture in Spanish Colonial and Spanish Baroque styles.

The Mayor of Bogotá and the City Council – both elected by popular vote – are responsible for city administration. In 2023 Carlos Fernando Galán was elected Mayor; his term runs from 2024 to 2027.

=== Localities ===
The city is divided into 20 localities: Usaquén, Chapinero, Santa Fe, San Cristóbal, Usme, Tunjuelito, Bosa, Kennedy, Fontibón, Engativá, Suba, Barrios Unidos, Teusaquillo, Los Mártires, Antonio Nariño, Puente Aranda, La Candelaria, Rafael Uribe Uribe, Ciudad Bolívar and Sumapaz.

Each of the 20 localities is governed by an administrative board elected by popular vote, made up of no fewer than seven members. The Mayor designates local mayors from candidates nominated by the respective administrative board.

== Infrastructure ==
Energy and sewer bills are stratified based on the location of owner&#x27;s residence, The system is the classification of the residential properties that should receive public services. Although the system does not consider the income per person and the rules say that the residential real estate should stratify and not households. All mayors should do the stratification of residential properties of their municipality or district.

Bogotá&#x27;s social strata have been divided as follows and have been extensively used by the government as a reference to develop social welfare programs, statistical information and to some degree for the assignment of lands.
* Estrato 1 (lowest)
* Estrato 2 (low)
* Estrato 3 (mid-low)
* Estrato 4 (mid-high)
* Estrato 5 (high)
* Estrato 6 (highest)
== Transport ==
In addition to this, the metropolis currently has over 650 kilometers of urban bicycle paths divided among its 20 boroughs, making it the city with the largest bicycle lane system on the planet. Bogotá massive urban growth during the 20th and 21st centuries due to immigration and rapid urbanization of neighboring cities has placed a strain on the city&#x27;s downtown avenues and highways, but since the creation of the Bogota Metropolitan area in 1990 significant efforts to upgrade the city&#x27;s infrastructure have been undertaken, including the construction of several new avenues and boulevards, as well as the construction of the first two lines of the Bogota Metro. In recent years, the capital district has embarked on several city building projects including the expansion of the Avenida Boyaca and Autopista Norte, as well as the construction of the brand new Avenida Guayacanes, a 13-kilometer 8-lane avenue currently being constructed from scratch in the boroughs of Bosa and Kennedy, as well as the excavations for the city&#x27;s second metro line. Private car ownership forms a major part of the congestion, in addition to taxis, buses, and commercial vehicles. Buses remain the main means of mass transit. There are two bus systems: the traditional system and the TransMilenio BRT system. The city&#x27;s administration is currently in the process of replacing and updating the entire fleet for the TransMilenio BRT system, adopting Euro VI-standard CNG-powered buses as well as electric buses. Once completed, Bogotá will have the largest electric bus fleet in the world outside China.

The traditional system runs a variety of bus types, operated by several companies on normal streets and avenues: &quot;Bus&quot; (large buses), &quot;Buseta&quot; (medium size buses) and &quot;Colectivo&quot; (vans or minivans). The bigger buses were divided into two categories: &quot;Ejecutivo&quot;, which was originally to be a deluxe service and was not to carry standing passengers, and &quot;corriente&quot; or normal service. Since May 2008, all buses run as &quot;corriente&quot; services. Bogotá is a hub for domestic and international bus routes. The Bogotá terminal serves routes to most cities and towns in Colombia and is the largest in the country. There is international service to Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.

The TransMilenio system was created during Enrique Peñalosa&#x27;s mayoral term, and is a form of bus rapid transit that has been deployed as a measure to compensate for the lack of a subway or rail system. TransMilenio combines articulated buses that operate on dedicated bus roads (busways) and smaller buses (feeders) that operate in residential areas, bringing passengers to the main grid. TransMilenio&#x27;s main routes are: Caracas Avenue, Northern Highway (&quot;Autopista Norte&quot;), 80th Street, Americas Avenue, Jiménez Avenue, and 30th Avenue (also referred to as &quot;Norte Quito Sur&quot; or &quot;N.Q.S.&quot; for short). Routes for Suba Avenue and Southern Highway (&quot;Autopista Sur&quot;), the southern leg of the 30th Avenue, were opened in April 2006. The third phase of the system will cover 7th Avenue, 10th Avenue, and 26th Street (or &quot;Avenida El Dorado&quot;). The system is planned to cover the entire city by 2030. Although the Transmilenio carries commuters to numerous corners of the city, it is more expensive (US$0.80 or 2300 COP) than any public transport, except taxis.

In addition to TransMilenio, the Peñalosa administration and voter-approved referendums helped to establish travel restrictions on cars with certain license plate numbers during peak hours called Pico y placa (peak, as in hour, and plate, as in license plate); of Ciclovía on Sundays and major holidays; a massive system ( ) of bicycle paths and segregated lanes called &quot;ciclorrutas&quot;; and the removal of thousands of parking spots in an attempt to make roads more pedestrian-friendly and discourage car use. &quot;Ciclorrutas&quot; is one of the most extensive dedicated bike path networks of any city in the world, with a total extension of . It extends from the north of the city, 170th Street, to the south, 27th Street, and from Monserrate on the east to the Bogotá River on the west. The &quot;ciclorruta&quot; was started by the 1995–1998 Antanas Mockus administration with a few kilometers, and considerably extended afterwards with the development of a Bicycle Master Plan and the addition of paths hundreds of kilometers in extent. Since the construction of the &quot;ciclorruta&quot; bicycle use in the city has increased, and a car free week was introduced in 2014.
=== Airports ===

Bogotá&#x27;s main airport is El Dorado International Airport, with an approximate area of located west of the city&#x27;s downtown in the Fontibón Locality. It is the second busiest airport in Latin America after Mexico City International Airport and it is the busiest airport in Colombia. Construction of the airport was ordered by Gustavo Rojas Pinilla (19th President of Colombia) in 1955 to replace the Aeropuerto de Techo. Due to its central location in Colombia and in Latin America, it is a hub for Colombia&#x27;s Flagship Carrier Avianca, Copa Airlines Colombia and LATAM Colombia. It is also serviced by a number of international airlines including American, Delta, United, Air France, KLM, Turkish Airlines, JetBlue, Lufthansa, Emirates, Iberia and Air Canada. The national airport has begun to take more responsibility due to the congestion at the international airport. In response to the high demand of approximately 27 Million passengers per year,

A secondary airport, CATAM, serves as a base for Military and Police Aviation. This airport, which uses the runways of El Dorado will eventually move to Madrid, a nearby town in the region of Cundinamarca, leaving further space to expand El Dorado.

Guaymaral Airport is another small airport located in the northern boundaries of Bogotá. It is used mainly for private aviation activities.

=== Urban and suburban railways ===
Bogotá has little railway transit infrastructure, following the collapse of the tram network, although a number of plans hope to change that. The Bogotá Metro has been pushed forward by two successive governments, and construction began in 2020 with opening planned for 2028. Plans to construct railways in and out of the city, replacing defunct routes, have been delayed due to the pressing need for transport within the city. A tram train line using right-of-way from the defunct Bogotá Savannah Railway, known as RegioTram, will be opening in 2023.

=== Bicycle infrastructure ===

Bogotá has most extensive and comprehensive network of bike paths in Colombia. Bogotá&#x27;s bike paths network or Ciclorrutas de Bogotá in Spanish, designed and built during the administration of Mayors Antanas Mockus and Enrique Peñalosa, is also one of the most extensive in the world and the most extensive in Latin America. The network is integrated with the TransMilenio bus system which has bicycle parking facilities, therefore rendering it feasible to cross the entire metropolitan area while riding a bike.

Bogotá implemented a healthy lifestyle program called &quot;Ciclovía&quot;, through which principal highways are closed from 7:00 a.m. until 2:00 pm on Sundays and public holidays. Thanks to the &quot;Ciclovía&quot;, the general population rides its bikes enjoying the city as well as exercising. In addition, cars do not circulate as heavily, so there is less pollution. Along the same lines, just during the month of December, the same activity is carried out at night; there are some special amenities and activities, such as fireworks, street theater performances, and street food vendors.

Since 4 April 2016 the carrera 11 has been reduced from four to three car lanes and a new bike lane (&quot;ciclorruta&quot;) has been inaugurated.

=== Tramway ===
On 25 December 1884, the first tramway pulled by mules was inaugurated and covered the route from Plaza de Bolívar to Chapinero, and in 1892, the line connecting Plaza de Bolívar and La Sabana Station started operating. The tramway ran over wooden rails and was easily derailed, so steel rails imported from Britain were eventually installed. In 1894, a tramway car ran the Bogotá–Chapinero line every 20 minutes. The tram system eventually grew to cover most of the city and its surrounding suburbs. But during the Bogotazo riots of 1948, the system suffered heavy damage and was forced to close. The economic effects of the subsequent civil war that followed prevented the damage from being repaired. Parts of the system continued to operate in a reduced state until 1951, when they were replaced by buses. Most of the streetcar tracks were eventually paved over, but exposed tracks can still be seen on many of the older roads of the city, especially downtown and in the La Candelaria area, although it has been about 70 years since any vehicles have run on them.

===Bogotá public transportation statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bogotá, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 97 min. 32% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 20 min, while 40% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8 km, while 16% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.

== Education ==
Known as the Athens of South America, Bogotá has an extensive educational system of both primary and secondary schools and colleges. Due to the constant migration of people into the nation&#x27;s capital, the availability of quotas for access to education offered by the State free of charge is often insufficient. The city also has a diverse system of colleges and private schools.

There are a number of universities, both public and private. In 2002, there were a total of 113 higher education institutions; in Bogotá there are several universities, most partially or fully accredited by the NAC (National Accreditation Council): National University of Colombia, University of the Andes, Colombia, District University of Bogotá, La Salle University, Colombia, University of La Sabana, Pontifical Xavierian University, Our Lady of the Rosary University, Universidad Externado de Colombia, Military University Nueva Granada, Central University, Colombia, El Bosque University, University of America, Sergio Arboleda University, Jorge Tadeo Lozano University, Pilot University of Colombia, Catholic University of Colombia, Saint Thomas Aquinas University and Universidad Pedagógica Nacional.

The city has a University City at the National University of Colombia campus located in the traditional sector Teusaquillo. It is the largest campus in Colombia and one of the largest in Latin America.

== Culture ==

Bogotá has many cultural venues including 58 museums, 62 art galleries, 150 libraries (of different types), 45 stage theaters, 75 sports and attraction parks, and over 150 national monuments. Many of these are renowned globally such as: BibloRed, Bogotá&#x27;s Public Libraries Network, the Luis Ángel Arango Library, the most important in the region which receives well over 6 million visitors a year; the Colombian National Museum, one of the oldest in the Americas, dating back to 1823; the Ibero-American Theater Festival, largest of its kind in the world, receives 2 million attendees enjoying over 450 performances across theaters and off the street; the Bogotá Philharmonic is the most important symphony orchestra in Colombia, with over 100 musicians and 140 performances a year. The city has been a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the category of music since March 2012. In 2007, Bogotá was named World Book Capital by UNESCO.

The Cristóbal Colón Theater, the country&#x27;s oldest Opera House, opened in 1892. It is home to the National Symphony Association&#x27;s major act, the National Symphony Orchestra of Colombia.
Rock al Parque or Rock at the Park is an open air rock music festival. Recurring annually, it gathers over 320,000 music fans who can enjoy over 60 band performances for free during three days a year. The series have been so successful during its 15 years of operation that the city has replicated the initiative for other music genres, resulting in other recent festivals like Salsa at the Park, Hip Hop at the Park, Ballet at the Park, Opera at the Park, and Jazz at the Park.

Kids&#x27; Choice Awards Colombia, are the awards given in the city by Nickelodeon and the first ceremony was given in 2014 by the singer Maluma and in Corferias the ceremony has been the home of shows given by artists like Austin Mahone, Carlos Peña, Don Tetto and Riva among others.

Bogotá has worked in recent years to position itself as leader in cultural offerings in South America, and it is increasingly being recognized worldwide as a hub in the region for the development of the arts.
In 2007, Bogotá was awarded the title of Cultural Capital of Ibero-America by the UCCI (Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities), and it became the only city to have received the recognition twice, after being awarded for the first time in 1991.

=== Cultural history ===
Bogotá gave the Spanish-speaking world José Asunción Silva (1865–1896), Modernism pioneer. His poetic work in the novel &quot;De sobremesa&quot; has a place in outstanding American literature. Rafael Pombo (1833–1912) was an American romanticism poet who left a collection of fables essential part of children imagination and Colombian tradition.

=== Architecture ===
The urban morphology and typology of colonial buildings in Bogotá have been maintained since the late nineteenth century, long after the independence of Colombia (1810). This persistence of the colonial setting is still visible, particularly in La Candelaria, the historical center of Bogotá. Also kept up are the colonial houses of two stories, with courtyards, gabled roofs, ceramic tiles and balconies. In some cases, these balconies were enclosed with glass windows during the Republican period, a distinguishing feature of the architecture of the sector (for example, the House of Rafael Pombo).

&quot;Republican Architecture&quot; was the style that prevailed between 1830 and 1930. Although there were attempts to consolidate a modern architectural language, the only examples seen are University City and White City at the National University of Colombia (constructed 1936–39). This work was developed by German architect Leopold Rother, although architects of rationalist trends participated in the design of campus buildings. There are also architecture trends such as art deco, expressionism and organic architecture. This last trend was typified by Bogotan architects in the second half of the twentieth century such as Rogelio Salmona.

In 2015 BD Bacatá was inaugurated, surpassing the Colpatria Tower to become the tallest building of the city and of Colombia. The building its expected to be the beginning of the city&#x27;s downtown renovation.
=== Libraries and archives ===
In 2007, Bogotá was named World Book Capital by UNESCO. Bogotá is the first Latin American city to receive this recognition, and the second one in the Americas after Montreal. It stood out in programs, the library network and the presence of organizations that, in a coordinated manner, are working to promote books and reading in the city. Several specific initiatives for the World Book Capital program have been undertaken with the commitment of groups, both public and private, engaged in the book sector.

The city is home to the Biblored, a network which administers 146 small and four large public libraries (Biblioteca Virgilio Barco, Biblioteca El Tintal, Biblioteca El Tunal and Biblioteca Julio Mario Santodomingo). It also has six branches of the Library Network of the Family Compensation Fund Colsubsidio and libraries and documentation centers attached to institutions like the Museo Nacional de Colombia (specializing in old books, catalogs and art), Bogotá Museum of Modern Art, the Alliance Française, and the Centro Colombo Americano.

Another set of libraries are the new collaborative initiatives between the state, city and international agencies. Examples are the Cultural Center Gabriel García Marquez, custom designed by the Fondo de Cultura Economica in Mexico, and the Spanish Cultural Center, which will begin construction with public funds and of the Spanish government in downtown Bogotá. 

The National Library of Colombia (1777), a dependence of the Ministry of Culture and the Biblioteca Luis Angel Arango (1958), a dependence of the Bank of the Republic are the two largest public libraries in the city. The first is the repository of more than two million volumes, with an important collection of ancient books. The latter has almost two million volumes, and with in size, it hosts 10,000 visitors a day; the Library Alfonso Palacio Rudas is also a dependence of the Bank of the Republic, and is located at the north of the city, with about 50,000 volumes. Other large public libraries are the Library of Congress in Colombia (with 100,000 volumes), of the Instituto Caro y Cuervo (with nearly 200,000 volumes, the largest Latin American library in Philology and Linguistics), the Library of the Academy of History The Library of the Academy of Language, the Library of the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History ICANH, and many university libraries.

Bogotá is home to historical records housed in the General National Archive, a collection of about 60 million documents, one of the largest repositories of primary historical sources in Latin America. Bogotá is also home to the Musical Archive of the Cathedral of Bogotá (with thousands of books and choral song-colonial period), the Archdiocesan Archive, the Archive of the Conciliar Seminary of Bogotá, the Archive History National University of Colombia and the Archive of the Mint in Bogotá, under the Bank of the Republic.

== Symbols ==
The flag originated with the insurgency movement against the colonial authorities which began on 20 July 1810, during which the rebels wore armbands with yellow and red bands, as these colors were those of the Spanish flag used as the flag for the New Kingdom of Granada. 

On 9 October 1952, exactly 142 years after these events, decree 555 of 1952 officially adopted the patriotic armband as the flag of Bogotá. The flag of Cundinamarca follows the same pattern, plus a light blue tile which represents the Virgin Mary&#x27;s cape.

The flag itself is a yellow band above a red one. The yellow denotes the gold from the earth, as well as the virtues of justice, clemency, benevolence, the so-called &quot;mundane qualities&quot; (defined as nobility, excellence, richness, generosity, splendor, health, steadfastness, joy and prosperity), long life, eternity, power and constancy. The red denotes the virtue of charity, as well as the qualities of bravery, nobility, values, audacity, victory, honor and furor, Colombians call it the blood of their people. 

The coat of arms of the city was granted by emperor Charles V (Charles I of Spain) to the New Kingdom of Granada, by royal decree given in Valladolid, Spain on 3 December 1548. It contains a black eagle in the center, which symbolizes steadfastness. The eagle is also a symbol of the Habsburgs, which was the ruling family of the Spanish empire at the time. The eagle is crowned with gold and holds a red pomegranate inside a golden background. The border contains olive branches with nine golden pomegranates on a blue background. The two red pomegranates symbolize audacity, and the nine golden ones represent the nine states which constituted the New Kingdom of Granada at the time. In 1932 the coat of arms was officially recognized and adopted as the symbol of Bogotá. 

Bogotá&#x27;s anthem lyrics were written by Pedro Medina Avendaño; the melody was composed by Roberto Pineda Duque. The song was officially declared the anthem by decree 1000 31 July 1974, by then Mayor of Bogotá, Aníbal Fernandez de Soto.

<text>Akathisia (IPA: /æ.kə.ˈθɪ.si.ə/) is a movement disorder characterized by a subjective feeling of inner restlessness accompanied by mental distress and/or an inability to sit still. Usually, the legs are most prominently affected. Those affected may fidget, rock back and forth, or pace, while some may just have an uneasy feeling in their body. The most severe cases may result in poor adherence to medications, exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms, and, because of this, aggression, violence, and/or suicidal thoughts. Akathisia is also associated with threatening behaviour and physical aggression in mentally disordered patients. However, the attempts to find potential links between akathisia and emerging suicidal or homicidal behaviour were not systematic and were mostly based on a limited number of case reports and small case series. Apart from these few low-quality studies, there is another more recent and better quality study (a systematic review from 2021) that concludes akathisia cannot be reliably linked to the presence of suicidal behaviour in patients treated with antipsychotic medication.
Antipsychotic medication, particularly the first generation antipsychotics, are a leading cause. Other agents commonly responsible for this side-effect may also include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, metoclopramide, and reserpine, though any medication listing agitation as a side effect may trigger it. It may also occur upon stopping antipsychotics. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve dopamine. When antidepressants are the cause, there is no agreement regarding the distinction between activation syndrome from akathisia. Akathisia is often included as a component of activation syndrome. However, the two phenomena are not the same since the former, namely antipsychotic-induced akathisia, suggests a known neuroreceptor mechanism (e.g., dopamine-receptor blockade). Diagnosis is based on the symptoms. It differs from restless leg syndrome in that akathisia is not associated with sleeping. However, despite a lack of historical association between restless leg syndrome and akathisia, this does not guarantee that the two conditions do not share symptoms in individual cases.
If akathisia is caused by an antipsychotic, treatment may include switching to an antipsychotic with a lower risk of the condition. The antidepressant mirtazapine, although paradoxically associated with the development of akathisia in some individuals, has demonstrated benefit, as have diphenhydramine, trazodone, benzatropine, cyproheptadine, and beta blockers, particularly propranolol.

The term was first used by Czech neuropsychiatrist Ladislav Haškovec, who described the phenomenon in 1901 long before the discovery of antipsychotics, with drug-induced akathisia first being described in 1960. It is from Greek &quot;a-&quot;, meaning &quot;not&quot;, and &quot;kathízein&quot;, meaning &quot;to sit&quot;, or in other words an &quot;inability to sit&quot;.

== Classification ==

Akathisia is usually classified as a medication-induced movement disorder. It can also be considered a neuropsychiatric concern, however, as it can be experienced purely subjectively without apparent movement abnormalities. Akathisia is generally associated with antipsychotics, but was previously described in Parkinson&#x27;s disease and other neuropsychiatric disorders. It can also present with the use of non-psychiatric medications, including calcium channel blockers, antibiotics, anti-nausea and anti-vertigo drugs.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of akathisia are often described in vague terms, such as feeling nervous, uneasy, tense, twitchy, restless, and unable to relax. Reported symptoms also include insomnia, a sense of discomfort, motor restlessness, marked anxiety, and panic. Symptoms have also been said to resemble symptoms of neuropathic pain similar to fibromyalgia and restless legs syndrome. When caused by psychiatric drugs, akathisia usually disappears quickly once the medication is reduced or stopped. However, late-onset akathisia, or &quot;tardive akathisia,&quot; may persist for months or years after the medication is discontinued.

When misdiagnosis occurs in antipsychotic-induced akathisia, more antipsychotics may be prescribed, potentially worsening the symptoms. If not identified, akathisia symptoms can increase in severity and lead to suicidal thoughts, aggression and violence.

Visible signs of akathisia include repetitive movements, such as crossing and uncrossing the legs and constant shifting from one foot to the other. Other noted signs include rocking back and forth, fidgeting, and pacing. However, not all observable restless motion is akathisia. For example, while mania, agitated depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may present like akathisia, movements resulting from them feel voluntary, rather than being due to restlessness.

Jack Henry Abbott, who was diagnosed with akathisia, described the sensation in 1981 as: &quot;You ache with restlessness, so you feel you have to walk, to pace. And then as soon as you start pacing, the opposite occurs to you; you must sit and rest. Back and forth, up and down you go … you cannot get relief …&quot;

== Causes ==

=== Medication-induced ===

Medication-induced akathisia is termed &quot;acute akathisia&quot; and is frequently associated with the use of antipsychotics. Antipsychotics block dopamine receptors, but the pathophysiology is poorly understood. Even so, drugs with successful therapeutic effects in the treatment of medication-induced akathisia have provided additional insight into the involvement of other transmitter systems. These include benzodiazepines, β-adrenergic blockers, and serotonin antagonists. Another major cause of the syndrome is the withdrawal observed in drug-dependent individuals.

Akathisia involves increased levels of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which is associated with mechanisms that regulate aggression, alertness, and arousal. It has been correlated with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and related syndromes, with descriptions of akathisia predating the existence of pharmacologic agents.

Akathisia can be miscoded in side effect reports from antidepressant clinical trials as &quot;agitation, emotional lability, and hyperkinesis (overactivity)&quot;; misdiagnosis of akathisia as simple motor restlessness occurred, but was more properly classed as dyskinesia.

== Diagnosis ==
The presence and severity of akathisia can be measured using the Barnes Akathisia Scale, which assesses both objective and subjective criteria. Precise assessment of akathisia is problematic, as there are various types making it difficult to differentiate from disorders with similar symptoms.

The primary distinguishing features of akathisia in comparison with other syndromes are primarily subjective characteristics, such as the feeling of inner restlessness and tension. Akathisia can commonly be mistaken for agitation secondary to psychotic symptoms or mood disorder, antipsychotic dysphoria, restless legs syndrome, anxiety, insomnia, drug withdrawal states, tardive dyskinesia, or other neurological and medical conditions.

The controversial diagnosis of &quot;pseudoakathisia&quot; is sometimes given.

== Treatment ==
Acute akathisia induced by medication, often antipsychotics, is treated by reducing or discontinuing the medication. Low doses of the antidepressant mirtazapine may be of help. 
Biperiden, an antipsychotic antidote, commonly used to improve acute extrapyramidal side effects related to antipsychotic drug therapy, is also used to treat akathisia.
Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam; beta blockers such as propranolol; anticholinergics such as benztropine; and serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine may also be of help in treating acute akathisia but are much less effective for treating chronic akathisia. Vitamin B, and iron supplementation if deficient, may be of help.
Although they are sometimes used to treat akathisia, benzodiazepines and antidepressants can actually cause akathisia.

== Epidemiology ==
Approximately one out of four individuals treated with first-generation antipsychotics have akathisia. Prevalence rates may be lower for modern treatment as second-generation antipsychotics carry a lower risk of akathisia. In 2015, a French study found an overall prevalence rate of 18.5% in a sample of outpatients with schizophrenia.

== History ==

The term was first used by Czech neuropsychiatrist Ladislav Haškovec, who described the phenomenon in a non-medication induced presentation in 1901.

Reports of medication-induced akathisia from chlorpromazine appeared in 1954. Later in 1960 there were reports of akathisia in response to phenothiazines (a related drug). Akathisia is classified as an extrapyramidal side effect along with other movement disorders that can be caused by antipsychotics.

In the former Soviet Union, akathisia-inducing drugs were allegedly used as a form of torture. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication, was used to induce intense restlessness and Parkinson&#x27;s-type symptoms in prisoners.

In 2020 clinical psychologist and professor of psychology Jordan Peterson was diagnosed with akathisia after being treated for insomnia and depression with benzodiazepines that was associated with an autoimmune disorder and was subsequently treated in Russia.

<text>Michael Swanwick (born November 18, 1950) is an American fantasy and science fiction author who began publishing in the early 1980s.

==Writing career==

Swanwick&#x27;s fiction writing began with short stories, starting in 1980 when he published &quot;Ginungagap&quot; in &quot;TriQuarterly&quot; and &quot;The Feast of St. Janis&quot; in &quot;New Dimensions 11&quot;. Both stories were nominees for the Nebula Award for Best Short Story in 1981.
His first novel was &quot;In the Drift&quot; (an Ace Special, 1985), a look at the results of a more catastrophic Three Mile Island incident, which expands on his earlier short story &quot;Mummer&#x27;s Kiss&quot;. This was followed in 1987 by &quot;Vacuum Flowers&quot;, an adventurous tour of an inhabited Solar System, where the people of Earth have been subsumed by a cybernetic mass-mind. Some characters’ bodies contain multiple personalities, which can be recorded and edited (or damaged) as if they were wetware.

In the 1990s, Swanwick moved towards the intersection between science fiction, fantasy, and magical realism. &quot;Stations of the Tide&quot; (1991) is the story of a bureaucrat&#x27;s pursuit of a magician on a world soon to be altered by its 50-year tide swell; it is set far in the future, blurring the line between magic and technology. &quot;The Iron Dragon&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1993) is a fantasy set in a Fairyland based on modern America, with elves wearing Armani suits and dragons serving as jet fighters. The main character, a changeling stolen from the real world, struggles to survive a factory, a high school, and a university, all the while being manipulated by a dragon. In &quot;Jack Faust&quot; (1997), a retelling of the Faust legend, the scholar does not gain magical power but modern scientific knowledge with which he begins the Industrial Revolution centuries early.

In the 2000s, Swanwick wrote several series of flash fictions, beginning with &quot;Puck Aleshire&#x27;s Abecedary&quot;, a collection of 26 stories, each titled for a different letter of the alphabet. Other series included &quot;The Periodic Table of Science Fiction&quot;, 118 stories each themed about a different chemical element. These were originally published in Sci Fiction. Later, &quot;The Infinite Matrix&quot; published &quot;The Sleep of Reason&quot;, in which each story was based on one of Goya’s &quot;caprichos&quot;. In this period, he won several awards for short fiction; between 1999 and 2003, he had nine stories shortlisted for the Hugo Award for Best Short Story, and won in 1999, 2000, and 2002.

He also continued to write novels. &quot;Bones of the Earth&quot; (2002) is a time travel story involving dinosaurs. &quot;The Dragons of Babel&quot; (2008) is set in the same world as &quot;The Iron Dragon&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, although the setting and characters are different; &quot;The Iron Dragon&#x27;s Mother&quot; (2019) was a third volume in the series. He has written two novels featuring the posthuman rogues Darger and Surplus, who had already appeared in short stories: &quot;Dancing with Bears&quot; (2011) concerns their adventures in post-Utopian Russia, and in “Chasing the Phoenix” (2015) they travel to China. After Gardner Dozois&#x27;s death, Swanwick completed his unfinished novel &quot;City Under the Stars&quot;.

His many works of short fiction have been collected in &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1991), &quot;Moon Dogs&quot; (2000), &quot;Tales of Old Earth&quot; (2000), and others. A novella, &quot;Griffin&#x27;s Egg&quot;, was published in book form in 1991 and is also collected in &quot;Moon Dogs&quot;. He has collaborated with other authors on several short works, including Gardner Dozois (&quot;Ancestral Voices&quot;, &quot;City of God&quot;, &quot;Snow Job&quot;) and William Gibson (&quot;Dogfight&quot;).

&quot;Stations of the Tide&quot; won the Nebula for best novel in 1991, and several of his shorter works have won awards as well: the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award for &quot;The Edge of the World&quot; in 1989, the World Fantasy Award for &quot;Radio Waves&quot; in 1996, and Hugos for &quot;The Very Pulse of the Machine&quot; in 1999, &quot;Scherzo with Tyrannosaur&quot; in 2000, &quot;The Dog Said Bow-Wow&quot; in 2002, &quot;Slow Life&quot; in 2003, and &quot;Legions in Time&quot; in 2004.

===Nonfiction writing===
Swanwick has written about the field as well. He published two long essays on the state of the science fiction (&quot;The User&#x27;s Guide to the Postmoderns&quot;, 1986) and fantasy (&quot;In the Tradition...&quot;, 1994), the former of which was controversial for its categorization of new SF writers into &quot;cyberpunk&quot; and &quot;literary humanist&quot; camps. Both essays were collected together in &quot;The Postmodern Archipelago&quot; 1997. A book-length interview with Gardner Dozois, &quot;Being Gardner Dozois&quot;, was published in 2001. He is a prolific contributor to the New York Review of Science Fiction. Swanwick wrote a monograph on James Branch Cabell, &quot;What Can Be Saved From the Wreckage?&quot;, which was published in 2007 with a preface by Barry Humphries, and a short literary biography of Hope Mirrlees, &quot;Hope-in-the-Mist&quot;, which was published in 2009.

=== Television and film ===
Swanwick&#x27;s short stories &quot;Ice Age&quot; and &quot;The Very Pulse of the Machine&quot; from &quot;Tales of Old Earth&quot; were adapted for the Netflix series &quot;Love, Death + Robots&quot; (2019) for its first and third seasons respectively.

==Personal life==
Swanwick thanks his wife, Marianne C. Porter, in all his books, referring to her as &quot;the M. C. Porter Endowment for the Arts&quot;.

He was a friend of Gardner Dozois and Susan Caspar for many years. From this friendship grew &quot;Being Gardner Dozois&quot; and several collaborations, including the novel &quot;City Under the Stars&quot;.

==Awards==

Swanwick is also the winner of the 1991 Inkpot Award, the 2010 Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association&#x27;s &quot;Toastmaster Award&quot; &amp; the 2020 Aelita Prize

<text>The Secret Seven or Secret Seven Society is a fictional group of child detectives created by Enid Blyton and based on the publisher&#x27;s children. They appear in one of several adolescent detective series which Blyton wrote.

The Secret Seven consists of Peter (the society&#x27;s head), Janet (Peter&#x27;s sister), Pam, Barbara, Jack, Colin and George. Jack&#x27;s sister Susie and her best friend Binkie make occasional appearances in the books; they hate the Secret Seven and delight in playing tricks designed to humiliate them, although this is partly fuelled by their almost obsessive desire to belong to the society.

Unlike most other Blyton non-school series, this one takes place during the school term time because the characters go to day schools.

Continuing Blyton&#x27;s series, Pamela Butchart wrote two new adventures in the series, adding elements of horror.

==Origins==
The names Secret Seven and Famous Five had already been used by the author Charles Hamilton, under the pen-name Frank Richards, in his long-running series of stories featuring Billy Bunter and Greyfriars School. The Secret Seven was the name of a secret society that featured in a series of eleven stories published in &quot;The Magnet&quot; magazine in 1934; the term &quot;Famous Five&quot; dates from 1910 and is applied to a group of the leading characters: Harry Wharton, Frank Nugent, Bob Cherry, Johnny Bull and Hurree Jamset Ram Singh.

It is not clear whether Enid Blyton was influenced by Hamilton&#x27;s work. Blyton&#x27;s elder daughter, Gillian Baverstock, describes a conversation between the author and her publisher that led to the inception of Blyton&#x27;s Secret Seven. The publisher&#x27;s own children, the eldest of whom was named Peter, had formed a secret society with their friends. They met in an old shed, used secret passwords and had badges inscribed with &quot;SS&quot;.

After corresponding with the real-life Peter, in 1948 Blyton published her first Secret Seven story, which describes how her fictional society came to be formed. This was a short story titled &quot;The Secret of the Old Mill&quot;. It followed an earlier short story, &quot;At Seaside Cottage&quot;, which introduced the leading characters, Peter and Janet, prior to the formation of the society. There followed a further five short stories and fifteen full-length books.

==Shorts==
The Secret Seven appeared in seven short stories by Blyton, including a mini-novella explaining how the society was formed. These were left uncollected until 1997, when all but &quot;At Seaside Cottage&quot; were published in a single volume by Hodder Children&#x27;s Books under the title of &quot;Secret Seven: Short Story Collection&quot;.

#At Seaside Cottage (1947) – first published as a complete short story book

==Full-length books==
#&quot;The Secret Seven&quot; (1949) – In the Secret Seven&#x27;s first full-length adventure together, Jack witnesses suspicious activity on a snowy night after searching for his badge near a large house where only a deaf, cantankerous caretaker resides. Suspecting a person is being held prisoner, the Seven then investigate the mystery.
#&quot;Secret Seven Adventure&quot; (1950) – While the Seven are playing Red Indians in a wood, Peter and Colin encounter a man who has just stolen Lady Lucy Thomas&#x27;s pearl necklace from Milton Manor. The search for the thief leads the children to a circus field and lions.

#&quot;Secret Seven on the Trail&quot; (1952) – A trick by Susie and her infuriating Famous Five group sends Jack and George on a night trek to Tigger&#x27;s Barn. But the prank leads the Secret Seven to a group of train robbers.
#&quot;Go Ahead Secret Seven&quot; (1953) – A little following practice by George goes awry and his parents force him to resign from the Secret Seven. Scamper is installed as his temporary replacement. Some shadowing by Colin puts the Seven on the trail of a man who shoves dogs down a coal hole. The group must then solve the mystery of the stolen dogs. By the end of the book, George is reinstalled as a member.
#&quot;Good Work Secret Seven&quot; (1954) – As Bonfire Night approaches, Susie and her friends play a prank on the Seven, leading them on a wild goose-chase to a shed. Later, Peter and Janet&#x27;s father&#x27;s car is stolen — with them inside — but the car is soon abandoned. The group&#x27;s plans for Bonfire Night seem scuppered when Scamper unwittingly sets alight their collection of fireworks. The Seven investigate the car thieves, with Peter disguising himself as a guy to keep watch for suspects at a cafe.
#&quot;Secret Seven Win Through&quot; (1955) – The Seven are evicted from their shed while it is painted, and find a new meeting place — a cave on Peter and Janet&#x27;s father&#x27;s property. They stock the cave with cushions, food, drinks and books, including Colin&#x27;s set of Famous Five novels. When their provisions start to go missing, the children suspect Susie; but Scamper later uncovers a notebook leading to crooks and a search for scarecrows.

#&quot;Secret Seven Fireworks&quot; (1959) – The Secret Seven are shocked when Jack&#x27;s sister forms a rival club called the Tiresome Three. But surely Susie wouldn&#x27;t really steal their guy&#x27;s clothes and firework money? And who are the nasty looking men lurking in the hut on Peter&#x27;s farm?
#&quot;Good Old Secret Seven&quot; (1960) – Jack&#x27;s new telescope promised hours of fun until Susie claimed her half share. But after Janet spots a strange face at the window of Torling Castle, The Seven must investigate.
#&quot;Shock for the Secret Seven&quot; (1961) – An argument between Peter and Jack leads to Jack resigning from the group, which is forced to become the Secret Six. But when dogs start going missing all over town, and Scamper also disappears, the group must solve the mystery. In the end, though, it is Jack who finds the vital clue and saves the day, and the Secret Seven is back together once more.
#&quot;Look Out Secret Seven&quot; (1962) – Medals belonging to a kindly old General have gone missing, and Colin promises to find them — but what can they do when there are no clues and the police are baffled?
#&quot;Fun for the Secret Seven&quot; (1963) – There is no actual mystery in the Secret Seven&#x27;s final outing. A boy named Bob Smith asks the Seven to help an elderly farm worker, Tolly, pay a vet&#x27;s bill for a lame horse that is at risk of being put to sleep. The children save the horse and toward the end of the book, thwart some horse thieves. During the story, Janet reads a &quot;Famous Five&quot; novel.

==Characters==
*Peter – The society&#x27;s leader. Although smart and strong, he is easily slighted and angered. A strong and capable leader, he has a bossy streak, verging on being downright unreasonable (particularly about wearing badges and remembering the password), reducing Pam and Barbara to tears, and on one occasion, causing Jack to temporarily leave the group. He, Janet and Jack are often closer with each other than other members of the group. Peter sometimes teases his sister, but acknowledges her as a good member of the society.
*Janet – Peter&#x27;s sister. Janet is very caring and she does her work seriously. She is more headstrong and braver than the other girls in the group. Her arch-enemy is Susie. Janet is very good friends with Pam and also gets along well with Jack. She thinks of many good ideas. She is quite messy, and takes too long to write if trying to write neatly.
*Jack – Peter&#x27;s best friend. He is frequently annoyed by his younger sister, Susie, who takes advantage of his tendency to forget the password. He gets along well with everyone in the group, especially Peter, but is also the only member who will willingly stand up to Peter when he feels that he is behaving unreasonably, to the extent that he once walked out on the group after an argument with him (although they reconciled at the end). Jack lives very near to Peter and Janet. He thinks Janet is a lot better than the other girls and wishes Susie was like Janet.
*Pam – A girl at Janet&#x27;s school. Her best friend is Barbara and she laughs a lot. Her full first name is Pamela. She sometimes proves herself a worthy member of the Secret Seven by getting brainwaves, but is sometimes careless, such as yelling out the password and squealing when Peter was nearly pushed out of their &quot;secret&quot; treehouse.
*Barbara – Another girl at Janet&#x27;s school. She and Pam generally work (and giggle) together when looking for clues or information. They are out a lot together, such as not being able to turn up to a meeting because they are going to the same party. Barbara was the only member to be chosen by Peter: the other four were all selected by Janet.
*Colin – A boy at Peter&#x27;s school. Colin is a valuable member of the society, though perhaps the quietest of the boys. He has a large family, most of whom live with him. He finds his family tiresome and is afraid of the dark. He made the mystery in &quot;Secret Seven Adventure&quot; warm up when he saw a man escaping from Lady Thomas&#x27;s house.
*George – A boy at Peter&#x27;s school. His best friend is Colin. George&#x27;s father once banned him from the society, but he later realized his mistake and let George rejoin. Not much else is known about him, as he is rather undeveloped as a character.
Scamper – Janet and Peter&#x27;s pet dog and beloved companion. He is not an official member of the Secret Seven, but the children count him as one, due to his regular usefulness in the denouement of the stories. He has temporarily filled in for members when they have left the group for any reason. He is a friendly golden English Cocker Spaniel. He loves food, especially biscuits.

===Supporting characters===
*Susie – Jack&#x27;s younger sister who frequently aggravates him and the Society which she enjoys humiliating and tormenting with her quick wit. However, this stems from her burning desire to join the Society, which Peter regularly refuses her. This is actually something of a disadvantage for Peter, as Susie is considerably more clever and cunning than some of the other members, especially Barbara and Pam, and would potentially be a more valuable member. The Seven occasionally make a temporary truce with Susie, and sometimes she helps them solve the mysteries.
*Binkie – Susie&#x27;s best friend who was even worse to Jack than his sister.
*Bony - Susie&#x27;s and Jack&#x27;s French friend who appears in one book. His real name is Jean Baptiste Boneparte. He is very timid, shy and loves dogs. Dogs love him too and are often attracted to him. He is more friendly towards Susie than to Jack and is often annoyed with the Secret Seven. He had been a member of Susie&#x27;s club for a few days before he returned to France and soon after that the club broke up.
*Jack the farmer – Jack the farmer is Peter and Janet&#x27;s father. He is not as strict as some parents of the day, but has taught Peter and Janet some very strong ideas about right and wrong.
*Peter and Janet&#x27;s mother – Peter and Janet&#x27;s mother is supportive of the Secret Seven and their good work. She frequently provides snacks for their meetings.
*Jack&#x27;s mother – Unlike Peter&#x27;s mother, Jack&#x27;s mother does not think the Secret Seven is particularly important and gets angry when Jack puts all his effort into fulfilling Peter&#x27;s wishes although she does sometimes provide for the Secret Seven.
*Matt the Shepherd – Peter&#x27;s father&#x27;s elderly colleague, who works on the farm. He has a dog called Shadow who is stolen in a mystery but is later recovered. He is portrayed as a helpful and caring old man.
*Shadow - Matt the shepherd&#x27;s strong, heavy shepherd dog who loves his master very much. Matt too loves him like a brother. He is stolen in a mystery in the book &quot;Shock for Secret Seven&quot; but is later recovered.
*The Inspector – The police inspector who the Secret Seven always report the cases to. He has become a good friend of the Secret Seven.
*Postie the Postman – Postie was the postman of the area and almost all dogs were attracted towards him. He was found to be criminal in the book &quot;Shock for Secret Seven&quot; and was jailed.
*The Gardener – Peter and Janet&#x27;s gardener, who has a very bad temper but can be witty and even useful when he helps capture some criminals along with Matt the Shepherd and Peter&#x27;s dad in Good Old Secret Seven.

<doc id="211280" wikidata="Q14443" url="?curid=211280" title="Mahi-mahi">
<text>The mahi-mahi ( ) or common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) is a surface-dwelling ray-finned fish found in off-shore temperate, tropical, and subtropical waters worldwide. It is also widely called dorado (not to be confused with &quot;Salminus brasiliensis&quot;, a freshwater fish) and dolphin (not to be confused with the aquatic mammal dolphin). It is one of two members of the family Coryphaenidae, the other being the pompano dolphinfish. These fish are most commonly found in the waters around the Gulf of Mexico, Costa Rica, Hawaii, and the Indian Ocean.

== Nomenclature ==

The name &quot;mahi-mahi&quot; comes from the Hawaiian language and means &#x27;very strong&#x27;, through the process of reduplication. By chance in Persian, () means &#x27;fish&#x27;, but the word is Hawaiian. Though the species is also referred to as the common dolphinfish, the use of &quot;dolphin&quot; can be misleading as they are not related to dolphins; The origin of the name &quot;dolphinfish&quot; is recent and was given to avoid confusion with dolphins, as the traditional name of the fish was also &quot;dolphin&quot;. See &quot;Coryphaena&quot; for the possible etymologies of &quot;dolphinfish&quot;. In parts of the Pacific and along the English-speaking coast of South Africa, the mahi-mahi is commonly referred to by its name in Spanish, . On the Mediterranean island of Malta, the mahi-mahi is referred to as the . In Indonesian, they are called .

Linnaeus named the genus, derived from the Greek word, , , meaning &#x27;top&#x27; or &#x27;apex&#x27;, in 1758. Synonyms for the species include &quot;Coryphaena argyrurus&quot;, &quot;Coryphaena chrysurus&quot;, and &quot;Coryphaena dolfyn&quot;.

== Description ==

Mahi-mahi have compressed bodies and one very long dorsal fin extending from the head almost to the tail fin. Mature males have distinctive &quot;foreheads&quot;; it grows as the fish matures and often protrudes well above the body proper, which is by the musculature of the back. This &quot;hump&quot; is a sexually dimorphic feature; females have a rounded head. Their caudal fins and anal fins are sharply . They are distinguished by dazzling colors – golden on the sides, and bright blues and greens on the sides and back. The pectoral fins of the mahi-mahi are iridescent blue. The flank is broad and golden. 
Out of the water, the fish often change color (giving rise to their Spanish name, &quot;&quot;, &#x27;golden&#x27;), going through several hues before finally fading to a muted yellow-grey upon death.

Mahi-mahi can live for up to five years, although they seldom exceed four. Females are usually smaller than males. Catches typically are and a meter in length. They rarely exceed , and mahi-mahi over are exceptional. Mahi-mahi are among the fastest-growing of fish. They spawn in warm ocean currents throughout much of the year, and their young are commonly found in rafts of &quot;Sargassum&quot; weeds. Young mahi-mahi migrate past Malta where they are called and Sicily where they are known as or ; there they are fished using nets and floating mats of palm leaves under which they collect.

Mahi-mahi are carnivorous, feeding on flying fish, crabs, squid, mackerel, and other forage fish. They have also been known to eat zooplankton. To pursue such varied pelagic prey, mahi-mahi are fast swimmers, swimming as fast as 50 knots (92.6 km/h, 57.5 mph).

Males and females are sexually mature in their first year, usually by the age of 4–5 months. Spawning can occur at body lengths of . Females may spawn two to three times per year, and produce between 80,000 and 1,000,000 eggs per event. In waters at 28 °C/83 °F, mahi-mahi larvae are found year-round, with greater numbers detected in spring and fall.
Mahi-mahi fish are mostly found in the surface water. Their flesh is grey-white when raw, cooking to an attractive white with a clean, flavour.

== Relation to humans ==
=== Fishing ===
==== Recreational fishing ====
Mahi-mahi are highly sought for sport fishing and commercial purposes. Sport fishermen seek them due to their beauty, size, food quality, and healthy population. Mahi-mahi can be found in the Caribbean Sea, on the west coast of North and South America, the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic coast of Florida and West Africa, Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal, South China Sea and Southeast Asia, Hawaii, Tahiti, and many other places worldwide.

Fishing charters most often look for floating debris and frigatebirds near the edge of the reef in about of water. Mahi-mahi (and many other fish) often swim near debris such as floating wood, five-gallon bucket lids, palm trees and fronds, or sargasso weed lines and around fish buoys. Frigatebirds search for food accompanying the debris or sargasso. Experienced fishing guides can tell what species are likely around the debris by the birds&#x27; behavior.

 gear is more than adequate when trolling for mahi-mahi. Fly-casters may especially seek frigatebirds to find big mahi-mahis, and then use a bait-and-switch technique. Ballyhoo or a net full of live sardines tossed into the water can excite the mahi-mahis into a feeding frenzy. Hookless teaser lures can have the same effect. After tossing the teasers or live chum, fishermen throw the fly to the feeding mahi-mahi. Once on a line, mahi-mahi are fast, flashy, and acrobatic, with beautiful blue, yellow, green, and even red dots of color.

==== Commercial fishing ====

The United States and the Caribbean countries are the primary consumers of this fish, but many European countries are increasing their consumption every year. It is a popular food fish in Australia, usually caught and sold as a byproduct by tuna and swordfish commercial fishing operators. Japan and Hawaii are significant consumers. The Arabian Sea, particularly the coast of Oman, also has mahi-mahi. At first, mahi-mahi were mostly bycatch in the tuna and swordfish longline fishery. Now, they are sought by commercial fishermen on their own merits.

In French Polynesia, fishermen use harpoons, using a specifically designed boat, the , to pursue it, because mahi-mahi do not dive. The &quot;&quot; is a powerful motorized V-shaped boat, optimized for high agility and speed, and driven with a stick so the pilot can hold his harpoon with his right hand. The method is also practiced by fishermen in the Philippines, especially in the northern province of Batanes, where the harpooning is called .

=== Environmental and food safety concerns ===
Depending on how it is caught, mahi-mahi is classed differently by various sustainability rating systems:

* The Monterey Bay Aquarium classifies mahi-mahi, when caught in the US Atlantic, as a best choice, the top of its three environmental-impact categories. The aquarium advises to avoid imported mahi-mahi harvested by long line, but rates troll and pole-and-line caught as a good alternative.
* The Natural Resources Defense Council classifies mahi-mahi as a &quot;moderate mercury&quot; fish (its second-lowest of four categories), and suggests eating six servings or fewer per month.

The mahi-mahi is also a common vector for ciguatera poisoning. Although a very popular food dish in many parts of the world, there have been reports of ciguatera poisoning from human consumption of this fish. Ciguatera poisoning is caused by the accumulation of toxins (ciguatoxins and maitotoxin) in the flesh of the fish over time. These are produced by &quot;Gambierdiscus toxicus&quot; which grows together with marine algae, which causes fish like the mahi-mahi to consume them by accident.

Mahi-mahi naturally have high levels of histidine, which is converted to histamine when bacterial growth occurs during improper storage or processing. Subsequent cooking, smoking, or freezing does not eliminate the histamine. This leads to a foodborne illness known as scombroid food poisoning, which also affect other fish such as tuna, mackerel, sardine, anchovy, herring, bluefish, amberjack and marlin. Symptoms are those of histamine intolerance and may include flushed skin, headache, itchiness, blurred vision, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, and the onset of symptoms is typically 10 to 60 minutes after eating and can last for up to two days. Rarely, breathing problems (like that of allergic asthma) or an irregular heartbeat may occur. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and may be supported by a normal blood tryptase.

<doc id="211284" wikidata="Q1235800" url="?curid=211284" title="Malory Towers">
<text>Malory Towers is a series of six novels by English author Enid Blyton. The series is based on a girls&#x27; boarding school that Blyton&#x27;s daughter attended, Benenden School, which relocated during World War II to the Hotel Bristol in Newquay, Cornwall. The series follows the protagonist, Darrell Rivers, on her adventures and experiences in boarding school. Darrell Rivers&#x27; name was inspired by that of Blyton&#x27;s second husband, Kenneth Darrell Waters.

In 2009, six more books were added to the series by author Pamela Cox. Events in these take place after Darrell has left the school and focus on her younger sister, Felicity Rivers.

==Plot summaries ==
===First Term at Malory Towers===
Darrell Rivers begins her first year at Malory Towers, a castle-like clifftop boarding school in Cornwall. She meets sharp-tongued, cheeky Alicia, musical genius Irene and timid Mary-Lou. Determined to do well and make friends, Darrell&#x27;s first term is turbulent. Her temper causes problems and her efforts at playing the fool backfire. Another new girl is Gwendoline Mary Lacey, who turns out to be vain, shallow and prone to occasional spitefulness and bullying. The Malory Towers stories largely centre on the intertwined stories of Darrell and Gwendoline, along with Alicia Johns, Sally Hope and Mary-Lou. The first book ends with Darrell finding a best friend in Sally Hope.

===The Second Form at Malory Towers===
The girls move into the Second form at Malory Towers with a new form mistress, Miss Parker, and three new girls. In an eventful term, new tricks are played on the teachers and the girls make the unpleasant discovery that there is a thief in their midst. Among the newcomers, Belinda delights the other girls with her sharply drawn caricature drawings, while Ellen worries about her position in the form and overworks herself. The third new girl is Daphne, who is not all she seems and is involved in a dramatic cliff top rescue on a stormy night.She rescues Mary Lou who was on the edge of dying on a cliff
===Third Year at Malory Towers===
Darrell and her friends are now in the Third Form, alongside more new girls. American girl Zerelda has ambitions to be a film star, while Wilhelmina, known to all as Bill, is obsessed with horses. There is also Mavis, who has a beautiful singing voice, which she foolishly risks when she attends a local talent contest and finds herself stranded at night outside the school in a rainstorm. Darrell has a smaller role in this story, mainly centred around her inclusion in a school lacrosse team.

===Upper Fourth at Malory Towers===
Sibling relationships are a theme of the fourth book, with the arrival at Malory Towers of Darrell&#x27;s younger sister Felicity, Alicia&#x27;s younger cousin June, and twins Connie and Ruth Batten. The fourth formers are working hard for the tough School Certificate examination, which quick-brained Alicia finds unexpectedly hard when she succumbs to measles. Darrell is Head Girl of the form, but is forced to resign when her temper gets the better of her once more. A sickly new girl, Clarissa, gives Gwendoline the idea of avoiding the examination by affecting a heart condition, which leads to a bitter confrontation with her appalled father.

===In the Fifth at Malory Towers===
The Fifth Form is asked to produce the school Christmas entertainment, which they decide should be the pantomime Cinderella. Darrell is the lead writer and Irene composes the music, while lead roles are taken by Alicia, Mary-Lou and Bill. Gwen finds herself much in the company of new girl Maureen who, to her discomfort, shares many of her vain and shallow traits. The Head Girl of the Fifth is the hard and domineering Moira, which creates much friction between the girls before matters are resolved and the show is triumphantly staged. Darrell realises she has a talent for writing and that this may be her future career.

===Last Term at Malory Towers===
In her final year, Darrell is now Head Girl of the school. In a frank exchange with Miss Grayling, they agree that the only real failure in Darrell&#x27;s year is Gwendoline, and Darrell undertakes to do what she can to try and set Gwen on a more positive path before it is too late. But Gwen is destined to get a huge shock that forces her to re-evaluate her future and bitterly regret some cruel words to her father. New girl Amanda finds herself in danger when she attempts to swim in the sea beyond the safe waters of the school pool, while second former Jo runs away from the school after stealing money from Matron.

===Pamela Cox books===
The second series of six books follows Felicity, Darrell&#x27;s younger sister, from her third year to her final term. Sally&#x27;s younger sister, Daffy, eventually joins the school when Felicity and her friends are in the sixth form. The final book of the new series, &quot;Goodbye Malory Towers&quot;, sees the return of the original cast, including Darrell, Sally, and Alicia, for a school reunion, and the addition of Gwendoline Mary Lacey to the teaching staff.

==Origins and inspirations==

Enid Blyton&#x27;s elder daughter Gillian joined Benenden School in the autumn of 1945. The school had relocated from its original site in Kent during World War II to the Hotel Bristol in Newquay, Cornwall. Although Gillian was only at the Cornish location of Benenden School for one term before it moved back to Kent, Malory Towers&#x27; position on the west coast (as shown on the maps drawn for the endpapers of the books) matches that of Beneden School in Newquay. Other features of the school seem to be inspired by Dorset, where Blyton holidayed annually: the coastal swimming pool is similar to the one at Dancing Ledge, and the school building itself is similar to Lulworth Castle.

Commenters have also remarked on the parallels between Gillian&#x27;s school life, as recorded in her diaries, and the plots of the Malory Towers books. It is even suggested that the Malory Towers stories were Blyton&#x27;s way of communicating with her daughter and providing counsel. The similarities include Darrell&#x27;s temper, interests in an acting career, and obsessions with horses. As with Darrell in the books, Gillian&#x27;s father was also a surgeon.

The incident in the first book that depicts Darrell pushing over Sally has a close parallel to an incident between Gillian and her younger sister Imogen. The entry in her diary reads:

&#x27;Imo annoyed me and I got in one of my tempers and knocked her down. She might have hurt herself. Really, I just don’t know what I do when in a temper. I might easily kill her one day.&#x27;

The plotline in &quot;Third Year&quot; that introduces the character Zerelda Brass, who has aspirations to become an actress, also has a parallel in Gillian&#x27;s diaries. A memo in the back of her 1946 diary reads:

&#x27;In the letter Mummy wrote she said she thought I would make a good actress and that if I wanted to be an actress she and Daddy would back me up. She said she was glad I was able to analyse my feelings. She said I had the right sympathetic feelings for an actress. She was very nice and I love her.&#x27;

==School building==
In its first appearance, the school is described thus:
She saw a big, square looking building of soft grey stone standing high up on a hill. The hill was really a cliff, that fell steeply down to the sea. At each end of the gracious building stood rounded towers. Darrell could glimpse other towers as well, making four in all. North Tower, South, East and West.
Each tower acts as a boarding house and provides accommodation for about 60 girls, ten in each year group. There is a Matron in each tower and a House Mistress in overall charge. The towers have four storeys, with kitchen, dining hall and common rooms on the ground floor, dormitories on the first and second floors, and staff rooms and storage are on the top floor.

The school forms a square with a courtyard in the middle. The sides of the school are three storeys high. The front of the building, between the east and south towers, has the main entrance, gymnasium, assembly hall, laboratories and art room. The classrooms are between the west and the north towers. Between the north and east towers are the sanitorium and the headmistress&#x27;s rooms. The mistress&#x27;s rooms are between the south and west tower.

The school also has a rose garden, stables, tennis courts, sports pitches and an outside, natural swimming pool cut into the coastline.

==Main characters (Enid Blyton novels)==

The principal characters among the girls in the Enid Blyton books are: 

===North Tower girls in Darrell&#x27;s year===

*Darrell Rivers is the main character of the first six books. Although responsible and hard-working, her hot temper causes her problems, but she learns to control it as she goes up the school. She is very popular with her form. In the upper school she becomes Head of the Fourth Form, games captain in the Fifth and finally, in the Sixth Form, Head Girl of the school. As she gets older at Malory Towers she begins to realise her talent for writing and aspires to be a writer in her adult career.
*Gwendoline Mary Lacey is vain, shallow and occasionally prone to spiteful tricks and bullying. In Darrell&#x27;s final term, she and Headmistress Miss Grayling have a frank exchange where they agree that Gwen is a rare failure at Malory Towers. Soon after, Gwen is shocked when her father falls seriously ill and is in danger of his life. Shamefully remembering some of the cruel things she said to him while demanding that he sends her to a Swiss Finishing School, Gwen finally starts to re-evaluate her life.
*Alicia Johns is sharp-tongued and is the form joker, playing endless tricks on the teachers. Her quick mind enables her to easily cope with her academic work, and her pranks and jokes make her popular with other girls. However, she is also sharp-tongued and scornful of those less talented or healthy than her. She softens during her years at Malory Towers but is never given any role of responsibility because of her fondness for playing the fool.
*Sally Hope arrives at Malory Towers at the same time as Darrell, and the two become best friends. Jealousy is a persistent issue with Sally – her resentment of her younger sister is at the root of Sally&#x27;s withdrawn and odd behaviour during her first term, before matters are resolved. She tries to overcome her jealousy during her time at Malory Towers, but occasionally it continues to be a problem for her. Sally becomes Head of Form in her second year and games captain in the Sixth Form.
*Mary-Lou Linnet is a quiet, shy girl, described as having &quot;big, scared eyes.&quot; However, her courage and character develops as she moves through the school. She forms a threesome of friends with Darrell and Sally before finally finding a friend of her own, Daphne, who appears in the second form.
*Katherine is the head girl of the First Form in &quot;First Term at Malory Towers&quot;. She is a typically fair minded and straightforward character who stands no nonsense.
*Emily Lake is a quiet member and withdrawn member of the first form in &quot;First Term at Malory Towers&quot; whose main interest is sewing. Darrell invites her to tea with her parents at half term.
*Violet is described as shy and colourless, very much left out of things. She is mentioned once in &quot;First Term at Malory Towers&quot; and disappears from the stories thereafter.
*Jean MacDonald is a jolly, shrewd Scottish girl, adept at handling money for various school societies and charities. She becomes head of the form in &quot;Third Year at Malory Towers.&quot;
*Irene Edwards is a musical genius with a talent for mathematics, but is otherwise scatterbrained. A running theme is her repeated loss of her health certificate at the beginning of each term. She is best friends with the equally scatterbrained Belinda.
*Ellen Wilson – a new girl who joins in &quot;The Second Form at Malory Towers&quot; as a scholarship girl. She worries about her work and is described as having a pale, tired face.
*Belinda Morris arrives in &quot;The Second Form at Malory Towers&quot; and delights the other girls with her talent for drawing cartoons. She quickly becomes best friends with Irene, as the two are equally disorganised and prone to daydreaming.

===Related books===
Blyton wrote two other series about boarding-school life: the &quot;St. Clare&#x27;s&quot; and the &quot;Naughtiest Girl&quot; series.

==Adaptations==

=== German adaptation ===
The German version, published in the 1960s and 1970s underwent substantial changes to catch up with time (e.g. turntables instead of gramophones), to better resemble German grammar schools (playing handball instead of lacrosse). Furthermore, there were changes to character names – for instance, Darrell was renamed Dolly. From 1977 to 1997, twelve sequel books were published, telling Dolly&#x27;s further life which always stays close to the school: after studying at a partner university, she works as a house mistress, marries one of the teachers, and has a child of her own. The story ends in the 18th book with old Miss Grayling&#x27;s dignified retirement – and Dolly as her successor.

=== Stage musical ===

A stage production written and directed by Emma Rice and her company Wise Children has been touring theatres in 2019. It is a co-production with York Theatre Royal, in association with the Bristol Old Vic.

=== TV series ===

In 2019, it was announced that a television adaptation was being produced for British television channel CBBC, in association with Canada&#x27;s Family Channel. It was developed by Rachel Flowerday, who had previously worked on the television series &quot;Father Brown&quot;, and Sasha Hails. It specifically included a cast with members of BAME communities and actors with facial disfigurements. It premiered on 23 March 2020. Season 1 has 13 half-hour episodes about Darrell&#x27;s first year at Malory Towers.

<doc id="211285" wikidata="Q152810" url="?curid=211285" title="Landfill">
<text>A landfill is a site for the disposal of waste materials. It is the oldest and most common form of waste disposal, although the systematic burial of waste with daily, intermediate and final covers only began in the 1940s. In the past, waste was simply left in piles or thrown into pits (known in archeology as middens).

Landfills take up a lot of land and pose environmental risks. Some landfill sites are used for waste management purposes, such as temporary storage, consolidation and transfer, or for various stages of processing waste material, such as sorting, treatment, or recycling. Unless they are stabilized, landfills may undergo severe shaking or soil liquefaction of the ground during an earthquake. Once full, the area over a landfill site may be reclaimed for other uses.

==Operations==

Operators of well-run landfills for non-hazardous waste meet predefined specifications by applying techniques to:

# confine waste to as small an area as possible
# compact waste to reduce volume

They can also cover waste (usually daily) with layers of soil or other types of material such as woodchips and fine particles.

During landfill operations, a scale or weighbridge may weigh waste collection vehicles on arrival and personnel may inspect loads for wastes that do not accord with the landfill&#x27;s waste-acceptance criteria. Afterward, the waste collection vehicles use the existing road network on their way to the tipping face or working front, where they unload their contents. After loads are deposited, compactors or bulldozers can spread and compact the waste on the working face. Before leaving the landfill boundaries, the waste collection vehicles may pass through a wheel-cleaning facility. If necessary, they return to the weighbridge for re-weighing without their load. The weighing process can assemble statistics on the daily incoming waste tonnage, which databases can retain for record keeping. In addition to trucks, some landfills may have equipment to handle railroad containers. The use of &quot;rail-haul&quot; permits landfills to be located at more remote sites, without the problems associated with many truck trips.

Typically, in the working face, the compacted waste is covered with soil or alternative materials daily. Alternative waste-cover materials include chipped wood or other &quot;green waste&quot;, several sprayed-on foam products, chemically &quot;fixed&quot; bio-solids, and temporary blankets. Blankets can be lifted into place at night and then removed the following day prior to waste placement. The space that is occupied daily by the compacted waste and the cover material is called a daily cell. Waste compaction is critical to extending the life of the landfill. Factors such as waste compressibility, waste-layer thickness and the number of passes of the compactor over the waste affect the waste densities.

== Sanitary landfill life cycle==

The term &quot;landfill&quot; is usually shorthand for a municipal landfill or sanitary landfill. These facilities were first introduced early in the 20th century, but gained wide use in the 1960s and 1970s, in an effort to eliminate open dumps and other &quot;unsanitary&quot; waste disposal practices. The sanitary landfill is an engineered facility that separates and confines waste. Sanitary landfills are intended as biological reactors (bioreactors) in which microbes will break down complex organic waste into simpler, less toxic compounds over time. These reactors must be designed and operated according to regulatory standards and guidelines (See environmental engineering).

Usually, aerobic decomposition is the first stage by which wastes are broken down in a landfill. These are followed by four stages of anaerobic degradation. Usually, solid organic material in solid phase decays rapidly as larger organic molecules degrade into smaller molecules. These smaller organic molecules begin to dissolve and move to the liquid phase, followed by hydrolysis of these organic molecules, and the hydrolyzed compounds then undergo transformation and volatilization as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), with rest of the waste remaining in solid and liquid phases.

During the early phases, little material volume reaches the leachate, as the biodegradable organic matter of the waste undergoes a rapid decrease in volume. Meanwhile, the leachate&#x27;s chemical oxygen demand increases with increasing concentrations of the more recalcitrant compounds compared to the more reactive compounds in the leachate. Successful conversion and stabilization of the waste depend on how well microbial populations function in syntrophy, i.e. an interaction of different populations to provide each other&#x27;s nutritional needs.:

The life cycle of a municipal landfill undergoes five distinct phases:

===Initial adjustment (Phase I)===

As the waste is placed in the landfill, the void spaces contain high volumes of molecular oxygen (O2). With added and compacted wastes, the O2 content of the landfill bioreactor strata gradually decreases. Microbial populations grow, density increases. Aerobic biodegradation dominates, i.e. the primary electron acceptor is O2.

===Transition (Phase II)===

The O2 is rapidly degraded by the existing microbial populations. The decreasing O2 leads to less aerobic and more anaerobic conditions in the layers. The primary electron acceptors during transition are nitrates and sulphates since O2 is rapidly displaced by CO2 in the effluent gas.

===Acid formation (Phase III)===

Hydrolysis of the biodegradable fraction of the solid waste begins in the acid formation phase, which leads to rapid accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in the leachate. The increased organic acid content decreases the leachate pH from approximately 7.5 to 5.6. During this phase, the decomposition intermediate compounds like the VFAs contribute much chemical oxygen demand (COD). Long-chain volatile organic acids (VOAs) are converted to acetic acid (C2H4O2), CO2, and hydrogen gas (H2). High concentrations of VFAs increase both the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and VOA concentrations, which initiates H2 production by fermentative bacteria, which stimulates the growth of H2-oxidizing bacteria. The H2 generation phase is relatively short because it is complete by the end of the acid formation phase. The increase in the biomass of acidogenic bacteria increases the amount of degradation of the waste material and consuming nutrients. Metals, which are generally more water-soluble at lower pH, may become more mobile during this phase, leading to increasing metal concentrations in the leachate.

===Methane fermentation (Phase IV)===

The acid formation phase intermediary products (e.g., acetic, propionic, and butyric acids) are converted to CH4 and CO2 by methanogenic microorganisms. As VFAs are metabolized by the methanogens, the landfill water pH returns to neutrality. The leachate&#x27;s organic strength, expressed as oxygen demand, decreases at a rapid rate with increases in CH4 and CO2 gas production. This is the longest decomposition phase.

===Final maturation and stabilization (Phase V)===

The rate of microbiological activity slows during the last phase of waste decomposition as the supply of nutrients limits the chemical reactions, e.g. as bioavailable phosphorus becomes increasingly scarce. CH4 production almost completely disappears, with O2 and oxidized species gradually reappearing in the gas wells as O2 permeates downwardly from the troposphere. This transforms the oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) in the leachate toward oxidative processes. The residual organic materials may incrementally be converted to the gas phase, and as organic matter is composted; i.e. the organic matter is converted to humic-like compounds.

==Social and environmental impact==
Landfills have the potential to cause a number of issues. Infrastructure disruption, such as damage to access roads by heavy vehicles, may occur. Pollution of local roads and watercourses from wheels on vehicles when they leave the landfill can be significant and can be mitigated by wheel washing systems. Pollution of the local environment, such as contamination of groundwater or aquifers or soil contamination may occur, as well.

=== Leachate ===

When precipitation falls on open landfills, water percolates through the garbage and becomes contaminated with suspended and dissolved material, forming leachate. If this is not contained it can contaminate groundwater. All modern landfill sites use a combination of impermeable liners several metres thick, geologically stable sites and collection systems to contain and capture this leachate. It can then be treated and evaporated. Once a landfill site is full, it is sealed off to prevent precipitation ingress and new leachate formation. However, liners must have a lifespan, be it several hundred years or more. Eventually, any landfill liner could leak, so the ground around landfills must be tested for leachate to prevent pollutants from contaminating groundwater.

=== Decomposition gases ===

Rotting food and other decaying organic waste create decomposition gases, especially CO2 and CH4 from aerobic and anaerobic decomposition, respectively. Both processes occur simultaneously in different parts of a landfill. In addition to available O2, the fraction of gas constituents will vary, depending on the age of landfill, type of waste, moisture content and other factors. For example, the maximum amount of landfill gas produced can be illustrated a simplified net reaction of diethyl oxalate that accounts for these simultaneous reactions:

4 C6H10O4 + 6 H2O → 13 CH4 + 11 CO2

On average, about half of the volumetric concentration of landfill gas is CH4 and slightly less than half is CO2. The gas also contains about 5% molecular nitrogen (N2), less than 1% hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and a low concentration of non-methane organic compounds (NMOC), about 2700 ppmv.

Landfill gases can seep out of the landfill and into the surrounding air and soil. Methane is a greenhouse gas, and is flammable and potentially explosive at certain concentrations Since decomposing plant matter and food waste only release carbon that has been captured from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, no new carbon enters the carbon cycle and the atmospheric concentration of CO2 is not affected. Carbon dioxide traps heat in the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. In properly managed landfills, gas is collected and flared or recovered for landfill gas utilization.

=== Vectors ===
Poorly run landfills may become nuisances because of vectors such as rats and flies which can spread infectious diseases. The occurrence of such vectors can be mitigated through the use of daily cover.

=== Other nuisances ===

Other potential issues include wildlife disruption due to occupation of habitat and animal health disruption caused by consuming waste from landfills, dust, odor, noise pollution, and reduced local property values.

==Landfill gas==
Gases are produced in landfills due to the anaerobic digestion by microbes. In a properly managed landfill, this gas is collected and used. Its uses range from simple flaring to the landfill gas utilization and generation of electricity. Landfill gas monitoring alerts workers to the presence of a build-up of gases to a harmful level. In some countries, landfill gas recovery is extensive; in the United States, for example, more than 850 landfills have active landfill gas recovery systems.

==Solar landfill==

A Solar landfill is a repurposed used landfill that is converted to a solar array solar farm.

==Regional practice==

===Canada===
Landfills in Canada are regulated by provincial environmental agencies and environmental protection legislation.
Older facilities tend to fall under current standards and are monitored for leaching. Some former locations have been converted to parkland.

===European Union===

In the European Union, individual states are obliged to enact legislation to comply with the requirements and obligations of the European Landfill Directive.

The majority of EU member states have laws banning or severely restricting the disposal of household trash via landfills.

=== India ===
Landfilling is currently the major method of municipal waste disposal in India. India also has Asia&#x27;s largest dumping ground in Deonar, Mumbai. However, issues frequently arise due to the alarming growth rate of landfills and poor management by authorities. On and under surface fires have been commonly seen in the Indian landfills over the last few years.

=== United Kingdom ===
Landfilling practices in the UK have had to change in recent years to meet the challenges of the European Landfill Directive. The UK now imposes landfill tax upon biodegradable waste which is put into landfills. In addition to this the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme has been established for local authorities to trade landfill quotas in England. A different system operates in Wales where authorities cannot &#x27;trade&#x27; amongst themselves, but have allowances known as the Landfill Allowance Scheme.

===United States===

U.S. landfills are regulated by each state&#x27;s environmental agency, which establishes minimum guidelines; however, none of these standards may fall below those set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Permitting a landfill generally takes between five and seven years, costs millions of dollars and requires rigorous siting, engineering and environmental studies and demonstrations to ensure local environmental and safety concerns are satisfied.

== Types ==
* Municipal solid waste: takes in household waste and nonhazardous material. Included in this type of landfill is a Bioreactor Landfill that specifically degrades organic material.
* Industrial waste: for commercial and industrial waste. Other related landfills include Construction and Demolition Debris Landfills and Coal Combustion Residual Landfills.
* Hazardous waste or PCB waste: Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) landfills that are monitored in the United States by the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (TSCA).

==Microbial topics==
The status of a landfill&#x27;s microbial community may determine its digestive efficiency.

Bacteria that digest plastic have been found in landfills.

==Reclaiming materials==
One can treat landfills as a viable and abundant source of materials and energy. In the developing world, waste pickers often scavenge for still-usable materials. In commercial contexts, companies have also discovered landfill sites, and many have begun harvesting materials and energy. Well-known examples include gas-recovery facilities.
Other commercial facilities include waste incinerators which have built-in material recovery. This material recovery is possible through the use of filters (electro filter, active-carbon and potassium filter, quench, HCl-washer, SO2-washer, bottom ash-grating, etc.).

==Alternatives==
In addition to waste reduction and recycling strategies, there are various alternatives to landfills, including waste-to-energy incineration, anaerobic digestion, composting, mechanical biological treatment, pyrolysis and plasma arc gasification. Depending on local economics and incentives, these can be made more financially attractive than landfills.

The goal of the zero waste concept is to minimize landfill volume.

==Restrictions==

Countries including Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, have banned the disposal of untreated waste in landfills. In these countries, only certain hazardous wastes, fly ashes from incineration or the stabilized output of mechanical biological treatment plants may still be deposited.

<doc id="211288" wikidata="Q16775468" url="?curid=211288" title="Elephantiasis">
<text>Elephantiasis, often incorrectly called elephantitis, is the enlargement and hardening of limbs or body parts due to tissue swelling (edema). It is characterised by edema, hypertrophy, and fibrosis of skin and subcutaneous tissues, due to obstruction of lymphatic vessels (lymphedema). It may affect the genitalia. The term elephantiasis is often used in reference to symptoms caused by parasitic worm infections, but may refer to a variety of diseases that swell parts of the subject&#x27;s body to exceptionally massive proportions.
==Cause==
Some conditions that present with elephantiasis include the following:
* Elephantiasis nostras, due to longstanding chronic lymphangitis.
* Elephantiasis tropica (known as lymphatic filariasis), caused by a number of parasitic worms, particularly &quot;Wuchereria bancrofti&quot;. More than 120 million people, mostly in Africa and Southeast Asia, are affected.
* Nonfilarial elephantiasis (or podoconiosis), an immune disease affecting the lymph vessels
* Leishmaniasis
* Elephantiasis, Grade 3 lymphedema, which may occur in people with breast cancer
* Genital elephantiasis, result of lymphogranuloma venereum
* Proteus syndrome, a genetic disorder best known as the condition possibly experienced by Joseph Merrick, the so-called Elephant Man

Other causes may include the following:
* Repeated streptococcal infection
* Lymphadenectomy
* Hereditary birth defects
* Pretibial myxedema

Other diseases, such as the rare Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome, can initially be misdiagnosed as elephantiasis.

<doc id="211289" wikidata="Q123738" url="?curid=211289" title="Hyde Park, London">
<text>Hyde Park is a , historic Grade I-listed urban park in Westminster, Greater London. A Royal Park, it is the largest of the parks and green spaces that form a chain from Kensington Palace through Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, via Hyde Park Corner and Green Park, past Buckingham Palace to St James&#x27;s Park. Hyde Park is divided by the Serpentine and the Long Water lakes.

The park was established by Henry VIII in 1536 when he took the land from Westminster Abbey and used it as a hunting ground. It opened to the public in 1637 and quickly became popular, particularly for May Day parades. Major improvements occurred in the early 18th century under the direction of Queen Caroline. The park also became a place for duels during this time, often involving members of the nobility. In the 19th century, the Great Exhibition of 1851 was held in the park, for which The Crystal Palace, designed by Joseph Paxton, was erected.

Free speech and demonstrations have been a key feature of Hyde Park since the 19th century. Speakers&#x27; Corner has been established as a point of free speech and debate since 1872, while the Chartists, the Reform League, the suffragettes, and the Stop the War Coalition have all held protests there. In the late 20th century, the park was known for holding large-scale free rock music concerts, featuring groups such as Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones and Queen. Major events in the park have continued into the 21st century, such as Live 8 in 2005, and the annual Hyde Park Winter Wonderland from 2007.

==Geography==
Hyde Park is a Royal Park in central London, bounded on the north by Bayswater Road, to the east by Park Lane, and to the south by Knightsbridge. Further north is Paddington, further east is Mayfair and further south is Belgravia. To the southeast, outside the park, is Hyde Park Corner, beyond which is Green Park, St. James&#x27;s Park and Buckingham Palace Gardens. The park has been Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens since 1987.

To the west, Hyde Park merges with Kensington Gardens. The dividing line runs approximately between Alexandra Gate to Victoria Gate via West Carriage Drive and the Serpentine Bridge. The Serpentine is to the south of the park area. Kensington Gardens has been separate from Hyde Park since 1728, when Queen Caroline divided them. Hyde Park covers , and Kensington Gardens covers , giving a total area of . During daylight, the two parks merge seamlessly into each other, but Kensington Gardens closes at dusk, and Hyde Park remains open throughout the year from 5 a.m. until midnight.

==History==
===Early history===
The park&#x27;s name comes from the Manor of Hyde, which was the northeast sub-division of the manor of Eia (the other two sub-divisions were Ebury and Neyte) and appears as such in the Domesday Book. The name is believed to be of Saxon origin, and means a unit of land, the hide, that was appropriate for the support of a single family and dependents. Through the Middle Ages, it was property of Westminster Abbey, and the woods in the manor were used both for firewood and shelter for game.

===16th–17th centuries===
Hyde Park was created for hunting by Henry Vlll in 1536 after he acquired the manor of Hyde from the Abbey. It was enclosed as a deer park and remained a private hunting ground until James I permitted limited access to gentlefolk, appointing a ranger to take charge. In October 1619, keepers directed by Sir Thomas Watson ambushed deer poachers with hail shot, and the poachers killed a keeper. 

Charles I created the Ring (north of the present Serpentine boathouses), and in 1637 he opened the park to the general public. It quickly became a popular gathering place, particularly for May Day celebrations. At the start of the English Civil War in 1642, a series of fortifications were built along the east side of the park, including forts at what is now Marble Arch, Mount Street and Hyde Park Corner. The latter included a strongpoint where visitors to London could be checked and vetted.

In 1652, during the Interregnum, Parliament ordered the then park to be sold for &quot;ready money&quot;. It realised £17,000 with an additional £765 6s 2d for the resident deer. Following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, Charles II resumed ownership of Hyde Park and enclosed it with a brick wall. He restocked deer in what is now Buck Hill in Kensington Gardens. The May Day parade continued to be a popular event; Samuel Pepys took part in the park&#x27;s celebrations in 1663 while attempting to gain the King&#x27;s favour.
During the Great Plague of London in 1665, Hyde Park was used as a military camp.

===18th century===

In 1689, William III moved his residence to Kensington Palace on the far side of Hyde Park and had a drive laid out across its southern edge which was known as the King&#x27;s Private Road. The drive is still in existence as a wide straight gravelled carriage track leading west from Hyde Park Corner across the southern boundary of Hyde Park towards Kensington Palace and now known as Rotten Row, possibly a corruption of &quot;rotteran&quot; (to muster), &quot;Ratten Row&quot; (roundabout way), &quot;Route du roi&quot;, or &quot;rotten&quot; (the soft material with which the road is covered). It is believed to be the first road in London to be lit at night, which was done to deter highwaymen. In 1749, Horace Walpole was robbed while travelling through the park from Holland House. The row was used by the wealthy for riding in the early 19th century.

Hyde Park was a popular duelling spot during the 18th century, with 172 taking place, causing 63 deaths. The Hamilton–Mohun duel took place there in 1712, when Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun, fought James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton. Baron Mohun was killed instantly, and the Duke died shortly afterwards. John Wilkes fought Samuel Martin in 1772, the year in which Richard Brinsley Sheridan duelled with Captain Thomas Mathews over the latter&#x27;s libellous comments about Sheridan&#x27;s fiancée, Elizabeth Ann Linley. Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow, fought Andrew Stuart in a Hyde Park duel in 1770. Military executions were common in Hyde Park at this time; John Rocque&#x27;s Map of London, 1746, marks a point inside the park, close to the Tyburn gallows, as &quot;where soldiers are shot.&quot;
The first coherent landscaping in Hyde Park began in 1726. It was undertaken by Charles Bridgeman for King George I; after the king&#x27;s death in 1727, it continued with approval of his daughter-in-law, Queen Caroline. Work was supervised by Charles Withers, the Surveyor-General of Woods and Forests, and divided Hyde Park, creating Kensington Gardens. The Serpentine was formed by damming the River Westbourne, which runs through the park from Kilburn towards the Thames. It is divided from the Long Water by a bridge designed by George Rennie in 1826.

The work was completed in 1733. The 2nd Viscount Weymouth was made Ranger of Hyde Park in 1739 and shortly after began digging the Serpentine lakes at Longleat. A powder magazine was built north of the Serpentine in 1805.

===19th–21st centuries===

Hyde Park hosted a Great Fair in the summer of 1814 to celebrate the Allied sovereigns&#x27; visit to England, and exhibited various stalls and shows. The Battle of Trafalgar was re-enacted on the Serpentine, with a band playing the National Anthem while the French fleet sank into the lake. The coronation of King George IV in 1821 was celebrated with a fair in the park, including an air balloon and firework displays.

One of the most important events to take place in Hyde Park was the Great Exhibition of 1851. The Crystal Palace was constructed on the south side of the park. The public did not want the building to remain after the closure of the exhibition, and its architect, Joseph Paxton, raised funds and purchased it. He had it moved to Sydenham Hill in South London. Another significant event was the first Victoria Cross investiture, on 26 June 1857, when 62 men were decorated by Queen Victoria in the presence of Prince Albert and other members of the Royal Family, including their future son-in-law Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia.

The Hyde Park Lido sits on the south bank of the Serpentine. It opened in 1930 to provide improved support for bathing and sunbathing in the park, which had been requested by the naturist group, the Sunlight League. The Lido and accompanying Pavilion was designed by the Commissioner of Works, George Lansbury, and was half funded by a £5,000 (now equivalent to £) donation from Major Colin Cooper (1892–1938). It still sees regular use in the summer.

Hyde Park has been a major venue for several Royal jubilees and celebrations. For the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887, a party was organised on 22 June where around 26,000 school children were given a free meal as a gift. The Queen and the Prince of Wales made an unexpected appearance at the event. Victoria remained fond of Hyde Park in the final years of her life and often drove there twice a day.

As part of the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 1977, a Jubilee Exhibition was set up in Hyde Park, with the Queen and Prince Philip visiting on 30 June. In 2012, a major festival took place in the park as part of the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee celebrations. On 6 February, the King&#x27;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, fired a 41-gun Royal Salute at Hyde Park Corner.
On 20 July 1982, a Provisional Irish Republican Army bomb killed four soldiers and seven horses. A memorial was constructed to the left of the Albert Gate to commemorate the soldiers and horses killed in the blast.

Since 2007, Hyde Park has played host to the annual Winter Wonderland event, which features numerous Christmas-themed markets, along with various rides and attractions, alongside bars and restaurants. It has become one of the largest Christmas events in Europe, having attracted over 14 million visitors as of 2016, and has expanded to include the largest ice rink in London, live entertainment and circuses.

On 18 September 2010, Hyde Park was the setting for a prayer vigil with Pope Benedict XVI as part of his visit to the United Kingdom, attended by around 80,000 people. A large crowd assembled along the Mall to see the Pope arrive for his address. An attempt to assassinate the Pope had been foiled after five people dressed as street cleaners were spotted within a mile of Hyde Park, and arrested along with a sixth suspect. They were later released without charge as police said they posed no credible threat.

==Grand Entrance==

During the late 18th century, plans were made to replace the old toll gate at Hyde Park Corner with a grander entrance, following the gentrification of the area surrounding it. The first design was put forward by Robert Adam in 1778 as a grand archway, followed by John Soane&#x27;s 1796 proposal to build a new palace adjacent to the corner in Green Park.

Following the construction of Buckingham Palace, the improvement plans were revisited. The grand entrance to the park at Hyde Park Corner was designed by Decimus Burton, and was constructed in the 1820s. Burton laid out the paths and driveways and designed a series of lodges, the Screen/Gate at Hyde Park Corner (also known as the Grand Entrance or the Apsley Gate) in 1825 and the Wellington Arch, which opened in 1828. The Screen and the Arch originally formed a single composition, designed to provide a monumental transition between Hyde Park and Green Park, although the arch was moved in 1883. It originally had a statue of the Duke of Wellington on top; it was moved to Aldershot in 1883 when the arch was re-sited.
An early description reports:
&quot;It consists of a screen of handsome fluted Ionic columns, with three carriage entrance archways, two-foot entrances, a lodge, etc. The extent of the whole frontage is about . The central entrance has a bold projection: the entablature is supported by four columns; and the volutes of the capitals of the outside column on each side of the gateway are formed in an angular direction, so as to exhibit two complete faces to view. The two side gateways, in their elevations, present two insulated Ionic columns, flanked by antae. All these entrances are finished by a blocking, the sides of the central one being decorated with a beautiful frieze, representing a naval and military triumphal procession. This frieze was designed by Mr. Henning, junior, the son of Mr. Henning who was well known for his models of the Elgin Marbles. The gates were manufactured by Messrs. Bramah. They are of iron, bronzed, and fixed or hung to the piers by rings of gun-metal. The design consists of a beautiful arrangement of the Greek honeysuckle ornament; the parts being well defined, and the raffles of the leaves brought out in a most extraordinary manner.&quot;

The Wellington Arch was extensively restored by English Heritage between 1999 and 2001. It is now open to the public, who can see a view of the parks from its platforms above the porticoes.

==Features==

Popular areas within Hyde Park include Speakers&#x27; Corner (located in the northeast corner near Marble Arch), close to the former site of the Tyburn gallows, and Rotten Row, which is the northern boundary of the site of the Crystal Palace.

===Botany===
Flowers were first planted in Hyde Park in 1860 by William Andrews Nesfield. The next year, the Italian Water Garden was constructed at Victoria Gate, including fountains and a summer house. Queen Anne&#x27;s Alcove was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and was moved to the park from its original location in Kensington Gardens.

During the late 20th century, over 9,000 elm trees in Hyde Park were killed by Dutch elm disease. This included many trees along the great avenues planted by Queen Caroline, which were ultimately replaced by limes and maples. The park now holds of greenhouses which hold the bedding plants for the Royal Parks. A scheme is available to adopt trees in the park, which helps fund their upkeep and maintenance. A botanical curiosity is the weeping beech, which is known as &quot;the upside-down tree&quot;. A rose garden, designed by Colvin &amp; Moggridge Landscape Architects, was added in 1994.

===Monuments===
There are a number of assorted statues and memorials around Hyde Park. The Cavalry Memorial was built in 1924 at Stanhope Gate. It moved to the Serpentine Road when Park Lane was widened to traffic in 1961. South of the Serpentine is the Diana, Princess of Wales memorial, an oval stone ring fountain opened on 6 July 2004. To the east of the Serpentine, just beyond the dam, is Britain&#x27;s Holocaust Memorial. The 7 July Memorial in the park commemorates the victims of 7 July 2005 London bombings.

The Standing Stone is a monolith at the centre of the Dell, in the east of Hyde Park. Made of Cornish stone, it was originally part of a drinking fountain, though an urban legend was established, claiming it was brought from Stonehenge by Charles I.

An assortment of unusual sculptures are scattered around the park, including: &quot;Still Water&quot;, a massive horse head lapping up water; &quot;Jelly Baby Family&quot;, a family of giant Jelly Babies standing on top of a large black cube; and &quot;Vroom Vroom&quot;, which resembles a giant human hand pushing a toy car along the ground. The sculptor Jacob Epstein constructed several works in Hyde Park. His memorial to the author William Henry Hudson, featuring his character &quot;Rima&quot; caused public outrage when it was unveiled in 1925.

There has been a fountain at Grosvenor Gate since 1863, designed by Alexander Munro. There is another fountain opposite Mount Street on the park&#x27;s eastern edge.

A pet cemetery was established at the north edge of Hyde Park in the late 19th century. The last burial took place in 1976.

===Police station===

Currently, the Metropolitan Police Service is responsible for policing the park and are based inside what is colloquially known as &#x27;the Old Police House&#x27;, which is situated within the park. The building was designed by John Dixon Butler, who was the forces&#x27;s surveyor between 1895 and 1920. For the police, he completed around 200 buildings, including the Former New Scotland Yard, Norman Shaw South Building (assisting Richard Norman Shaw); the adjoining Canon Row Police Station; Bow Road Police Station, Tower Hamlets; Tower Bridge Magistrates Court and adjoining Police Station; and 19–21 Great Marlborough Street, Westminster (court and police station). The architectural historian describes the building as being like, from a distance, &quot;a medium-sized country house of Charles II’s time.&quot; Hyde Park was policed by the Metropolitan Police from 1867 until 1993, when policing of the park was handed over to the Royal Parks Constabulary. In 2004 this changed back to the Metropolitan Police, following a review of the Royal Parks Constabulary by Anthony Speed.

==Debates==

Hyde Park&#x27;s Speakers&#x27; Corner has acquired an international reputation for demonstrations and other protests due to its tolerance of free speech. In 1855, a protest at the park was organised to demonstrate against Robert Grosvenor&#x27;s attempt to ban Sunday trading, including a restriction on pub opening times. Karl Marx observed that approximately 200,000 protesters attended the demonstration, which involved jeering and taunting at upper-class horse carriages. A further protest occurred a week later, but this time the police attacked the crowd.

In 1867 the policing of the park was entrusted to the Metropolitan Police, the only royal park so managed, due to the potential for trouble at Speakers&#x27; Corner. A Metropolitan Police station (&#x27;AH&#x27;) is situated in the middle of the park. Covering Hyde Park and sixteen other royal parks (mostly in London), the 1872 Parks Regulation Act formalised the position of &quot;park keeper&quot; and also provided that &quot;Every police constable belonging to the police force of the district in which any park, garden, or possession to which this Act applies is situate shall have the powers, privileges, and immunities of a park-keeper within such park, garden, or possession.&quot;

Speakers&#x27; Corner became increasingly popular in the late 19th century. Visitors brought along placards, stepladders and soap boxes in order to stand out from others, while heckling of speakers was popular. The rise of the Internet, particularly blogs, has diminished the importance of Speakers&#x27; Corner as a political platform, and it is increasingly seen as simply a tourist attraction.
As well as Speakers&#x27; Corner, several important mass demonstrations have occurred in Hyde Park. On 26 July 1886, the Reform League staged a march from their headquarters towards the park, campaigning for increased suffrage and representation. Though the police had closed the park, the crowd managed to break down the perimeter railings and get inside, leading to the event being dubbed &quot;The Hyde Park Railings Affair&quot;. After the protests turned violent, three squadrons of Horse Guards and numerous Foot Guards were sent out from Marble Arch to combat the situation. On 21 June 1908, as part of &quot;Women&#x27;s Sunday&quot;, a reported 750,000 people marched from the Embankment to Hyde Park protesting for votes for women. The first protest against the planned 2003 invasion of Iraq took place in Hyde Park on 28 September 2002, with 150,000–350,000 in attendance. A further series of demonstrations happened around the world, culminating in the 15 February 2003 anti-war protests, part of a global demonstration against the Iraq War. Over a million protesters are reported to have attended the Hyde Park event alone.

==Concerts==

The bandstand in Hyde Park was built in Kensington Gardens in 1869 and moved to its present location in 1886. It became a popular place for concerts in the 1890s, featuring up to three every week. Military and brass bands continued to play there into the 20th century.
The music management company Blackhill Enterprises held the first rock concert in Hyde Park on 29 June 1968, attended by 15,000 people. On the bill were Pink Floyd, Roy Harper and Jethro Tull, while John Peel later said it was &quot;the nicest concert I’ve ever been to&quot;. Subsequently, Hyde Park has featured some of the most significant concerts in rock. The supergroup Blind Faith (featuring Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood) played their debut gig in Hyde Park on 7 June 1969. The Rolling Stones headlined a concert (later released as The Stones in the Park) on 5 July that year, two days after the death of founding member Brian Jones, and is now remembered as one of the most famous gigs of the 1960s. Pink Floyd returned to Hyde Park on 18 July 1970, playing new material from &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;. All of the early gigs from 1968 to 1971 were free events, contrasting sharply with the later commercial endeavours.

Queen played a free concert organised by Richard Branson in the park on 18 September 1976, partway through recording the album &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;. The band drew an audience of 150,000 – 200,000, which remains the largest crowd for a Hyde Park concert. The group were not allowed to play an encore, and police threatened to arrest frontman Freddie Mercury if he attempted to do so.

The British Live 8 concert took place in Hyde Park on 2 July 2005, as a concert organised by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise awareness of increased debts and poverty in the third world. Acts included U2, Coldplay, Elton John, R.E.M., Madonna, The Who, and Paul McCartney, and the most anticipated set was the reformation of the classic 1970s line-up of Pink Floyd (including David Gilmour and Roger Waters) for the first time since 1981. The gig was the Floyd&#x27;s final live performance.

Acts from each of the four nations in the UK played a gig in the park as part of the opening ceremony for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The headliners were Duran Duran, representing England, alongside the Stereophonics for Wales, Paolo Nutini for Scotland, and Snow Patrol for Northern Ireland. Since 2011, Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park has taken place each September. The British Summer Time series of concerts have taken place every summer in Hyde Park since 2013, and have included performances by Black Sabbath, Neil Young, Celine Dion and Bon Jovi.

Local residents have become critical of Hyde Park as a concert venue, due to the sound levels, and have campaigned for a maximum sound level of 73 decibels. In July 2012, Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney found their microphones switched off after Springsteen had played a three-hour set during the Park&#x27;s Hard Rock Calling festival, and overshot the 10:30 pm curfew time.

==Sports==
Hyde Park contains several sporting facilities, including several football pitches and a Tennis centre. There are numerous cycle paths, and horse riding is popular.

In 1998 British artist Marion Coutts recreated Hyde Park, along with Battersea and Regent&#x27;s Park, as a set of asymmetrical ping-pong tables for her interactive installation &quot;Fresh Air&quot;.

For the 2012 Summer Olympics, the park hosted the triathlon, which brothers Alistair Brownlee and Jonathan Brownlee took the Gold and Bronze medals for Team GB, and the 10 km open water swimming events. The park has also hosted the ITU World Triathlon Grand Final.

==Transport==

There are five London Underground stations located on or near the edges of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens (which is contiguous with Hyde Park). In clockwise order starting from the south-east, they are:
*Hyde Park Corner (Piccadilly line)
*Knightsbridge (Piccadilly line)
*Queensway (Central line)
*Lancaster Gate (Central line)
*Marble Arch (Central line)

Bayswater tube station, on the Circle and District lines, is also close to Queensway station and the north-west corner of the park. High Street Kensington tube station, on the Circle and District is very close to Kensington Palace located on the Southwest corner of Kensington Gardens. Paddington station, served by Bakerloo, Circle and District, and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, is close to Lancaster Gate station and a short walk away from Hyde Park.

Several main roads run around the perimeter of Hyde Park. Park Lane is part of the London Inner Ring Road and the London Congestion Charge zone boundary. Transport within the park for people lacking mobility and disabled visitors is provided free of charge by Liberty Drives, located at Triangle Carpark.

Cycle Superhighway 3 (CS3) begins at Lancaster Gate, on the northern perimeter of Hyde Park. It is one of several TfL-coordinated cycle routes to cross the Park. CS3 also crosses Hyde Park Corner on its route towards Westminster and the City of London. The route opened in September 2018 and is signposted and cyclists are segregated from other road traffic on wide cycle tracks.

<doc id="211291" wikidata="Q1156594" url="?curid=211291" title="Perpetual check">
<text>In the game of chess, perpetual check is a situation in which one player can play an unending series of checks from which the defending player cannot escape. This typically arises when the player who is checking feels their position in the game is inferior, they cannot deliver checkmate, and wish to a draw.

A draw by perpetual check is no longer one of the rules of chess, but will eventually allow a draw claim by either threefold repetition or the fifty-move rule. Players usually agree to a draw long before that.

Perpetual check can also occur in other forms of chess, although the rules relating to it might differ. For example, giving perpetual check is not allowed in shogi and xiangqi, where doing so leads to an automatic loss for the giver.
==Examples==

In this diagram, Black is ahead a rook, a bishop, and a pawn, which would normally be a decisive advantage. But White, to move, can draw by perpetual check:
: 1. Qe8+ Kh7
: 2. Qh5+ Kg8
: 3. Qe8+ etc.
The same position will soon repeat for the third time and White can claim a draw by threefold repetition; or the players will agree to a draw. 
===Unzicker vs. Averbakh===

In the diagram, from Wolfgang Unzicker–Yuri Averbakh, Stockholm Interzonal 1952, Black (on move) would soon be forced to give up one of his rooks for White&#x27;s c-pawn (to prevent it from promoting or to capture the promoted queen after promotion). He can, however, exploit the weakness of White&#x27;s pawn structure with 
:27... Rxc7
:28. Qxc7 Ng4! 
Threatening 29...Qh2. If 29.hxg4 then 29...Qf2+, salvaging a draw by threefold repetition with checks by moving the queen alternatively to f2 and h4.
===Hamppe vs. Meitner===
In a classic game Carl Hamppe–Philipp Meitner, Vienna 1872, following a series of sacrifices Black forced the game to the position in the diagram, where he drew by a perpetual check: 
:16... Bb7+!
:17. Kb5 
If 17.Kxb7 Kd7 18.Qg4+ Kd6 followed by ...Rhb8#.
:17... Ba6+
:18. Kc6 
If 18.Ka4, 18...Bc4 and 19...b5#.
:18... Bb7+ 
===Leko vs. Kramnik===

In the game Peter Leko–Vladimir Kramnik, Corus 2008, Black was able to obtain a draw because of perpetual check:
:24... Qb4+
:25. Ka2 Qa4+
:26. Kb2 Qb4+
:27. Kc1 Qa3+
:28. Kb1 ½–½
If 28.Kd2? Rd8+ 29.Ke2 Qe7+.
===Fischer vs. Tal===

A perpetual check saved a draw for Mikhail Tal in the game Bobby Fischer–Tal, Leipzig 1960, played in the 14th Chess Olympiad, while Tal was World Champion. In this position Black played 
:21... Qg4+ 
and the game was drawn. (After 22.Kh1, then 22...Qf3+ 23.Kg1 Qg4+ forces perpetual check.)
==Mutual perpetual check==

A mutual perpetual check is not possible using only the orthodox chess pieces, but it is possible using some fairy chess pieces. In the diagram, the pieces represented as inverted knights are nightriders: they move any number of knight moves in a given direction until they are blocked by any piece along the path (that is, a nightrider is to a knight as a queen is to a king, ignoring the rules on check). There could follow:

:1. Ke3+ Kd5+
:2. Kd3+ Ke5+
:3. Ke3+ Kd5+

and so on. This is in fact a mutual perpetual &quot;discovered&quot; check.

Noam Elkies devised in 1999 a mutual discovered perpetual check position that requires only one fairy piece. The piece represented by an inverted knight here is a camel, a (1,3)-leaper. There could follow:
:1. Nb5+ Cc5+
:2. Nd4+ Cb2+
:3. Nb5+ Cc5+
and so on.

Xiangqi and janggi, due to the presence of their cannon pieces, can also have mutual perpetual check.
==Perpetual pursuit==

Related to perpetual check is the &quot;perpetual pursuit&quot;, which differs in that the continually attacked piece is not the king. The result is similar, in that the opposing side&#x27;s attack stalls because of the need to respond to the continuous threats.

In the Birnov study illustrated, White&#x27;s situation seems hopeless: they are down a piece and cannot stop Black&#x27;s h-pawn, and their passed a-pawn can easily be stopped by Black&#x27;s bishop. However, they can save themself by restricting the bishop&#x27;s movement to set up a perpetual pursuit. They begin:
:1. a6 Bxc4
A direct pawn race with 1...h3? fails, as White promotes first and covers the promotion square.
:2. e4+!
This pawn sacrifice forces Black to limit their bishop&#x27;s scope along the long diagonal.
:2... Kxe4
Forced, as Black has to play ...Bd5 to stop the pawn.
:3. a7 Bd5
:4. c4!
Denying another square to the bishop, which must stay on the a8–h1 diagonal. This forces
:4... Ba8
And White can then begin the perpetual pursuit:
:5. Kb8 Bc6
:6. Kc7 Ba8
Black can make no progress.
An example of perpetual pursuit being used in a game occurred in István Bilek–Harry Schüssler, Poutiainen Memorial 1978. Bilek thought he could win the enemy queen with the combination
:10. Nf6+ gxf6
:11. Bxf7+ Kxf7
:12. Qxd8
However, Schüssler replied
:12... Nd5! ½–½
and Bilek conceded the draw. His queen is now trapped, and with ...Bb4+ threatening to win it, he has nothing better than 13.0-0 Bg7 14.Qd6 Bf8 15.Qd8 Bg7 with another perpetual pursuit.
==History==

The &quot;Oxford Encyclopedia of Chess Games, Volume 1 (1485–1866)&quot; includes all recorded games played up to 1800. The earliest example of perpetual check contained in it is a game played by two unknown players in 1750:

: vs. Unknown, 1750 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. 0-0 (the rules of castling not yet having been standardized in their current form, White moved his king to h1 and his rook to f1) 4... Nf6 5. Nc3 Ng4 6. d3 0-0 (Black moved his king to h8 and his rook to f8) 7. Ng5 d6 8. h3 h6 9. Nxf7+ Rxf7 10. Bxf7 Qh4 11. Qf3 Nxf2+ 12. Rxf2 Bxf2 13. Nd5 Nd4 14. Ne7 Nxf3 15. Ng6+ Kh7 ½–½ in light of 16.Nf8+ Kh8 17.Ng6+ etc.

The next examples of perpetual check in the book are two games, both ending in perpetual check, played in 1788 between Bowdler and Philidor, with Philidor giving odds of pawn and move.

A draw by perpetual check used to be in the rules of chess. Howard Staunton gave it as one of six ways to draw a game in &quot;The Chess-Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;. It has since been removed because perpetual check will eventually allow a draw claim by either threefold repetition or the fifty-move rule. If a player demonstrates intent to perform perpetual check, the players usually agree to a draw.

<text>A price is the (usually not negative) quantity of payment or compensation expected, required, or given by one party to another in return for goods or services. In some situations, especially when the product is a service rather than a physical good, the price for the service may be called something else such as &quot;rent&quot; or &quot;tuition&quot;. Prices are influenced by production costs, supply of the desired product, and demand for the product. A price may be determined by a monopolist or may be imposed on the firm by market conditions.

Price can be quoted in currency, quantities of goods or vouchers.

* In modern economies, prices are generally expressed in units of some form of currency. (More specifically, for raw materials they are expressed as currency per unit weight, e.g. euros per kilogram or Rands per KG.) 
* Although prices could be quoted as quantities of other goods or services, this sort of barter exchange is rarely seen. Prices are sometimes quoted in terms of vouchers such as trading stamps and air miles. 
* In some circumstances, cigarettes have been used as currency, for example in prisons, in times of hyperinflation, and in some places during World War II. In a black market economy, barter is also relatively common.

In many financial transactions, it is customary to quote prices in other ways. The most obvious example is in pricing a loan, when the cost will be expressed as the percentage rate of interest. The total amount of interest payable depends upon credit risk, the loan amount and the period of the loan. Other examples can be found in pricing financial derivatives and other financial assets. For instance the price of inflation-linked government securities in several countries is quoted as the actual price divided by a factor representing inflation since the security was issued.

&quot;Price&quot; sometimes refers to the quantity of payment requested by a seller of goods or services, rather than the eventual payment amount. In business this requested amount is often referred to as the offer price (or selling price), while the actual payment may be called &quot;transaction price&quot; (or &quot;traded price&quot;). 

Economic price theory asserts that in a free market economy the market price reflects the interaction between supply and demand: the price is set so as to equate the quantity being supplied and that being demanded. In turn, these quantities are determined by the marginal utility of the asset to different buyers and to different sellers. Supply and demand, and hence price, may be influenced by other factors, such as government subsidy or manipulation through industry collusion.

When a raw material or a similar economic good is for sale at multiple locations, the law of one price is generally believed to hold. This essentially states that the cost difference between the locations cannot be greater than that representing shipping, taxes, other distribution costs and more.money

==Functions of prices==
According to Milton Friedman, price has five functions in a free-enterprise exchange economy which is characterized by private ownership of the means of production:
* Transmitting information about changes in the relative importance of different end-products and factors of production. 
* Providing an incentive for enterprise (a) to produce those products valued most highly by the market, and (b) to use methods of production that economize relatively scarce factors of production.
* Providing an incentive to owners of resources to direct them into the most highly remunerated uses
* Distributing output among the owners of resources
* Rationing fixed supplies of goods among consumers.

==Price and value==
The paradox of value was observed and debated by classical economists. Adam Smith described what is now called the &quot;diamond – water paradox&quot;: diamonds command a higher price than water, yet water is essential for life and diamonds are merely ornamentation. Use value was supposed to give some measure of usefulness, later refined as marginal benefit while exchange value was the measure of how much one good was in terms of another, namely what is now called relative price.

===Negative prices===
Negative prices are very unusual but possible under certain circumstances. Effectively, the owner or producer of an item pays the &quot;buyer&quot; to take it off their hands.

In April 2020, for the first time in history, due to the global health/economic crisis situation, the price of West Texas Intermediate benchmark crude oil for May delivery contracts turned negative, with a barrel of oil at -$37.63 a barrel, a one-day drop of $55.90, or 306%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. &quot;Negative prices means someone with a long position in oil would have to pay someone to take that oil off of their hands. Why would they do that? The main reason is a fear that if forced to take delivery of crude on the expiration of the May oil contract, there would be nowhere to put it as a glut of crude fills up available storage.&quot; In a sense the price is still positive, just the direction of payment reverses, i.e. in this case you are paid to take some goods.

Negative interest rates are a similar concept.

==Austrian School theory==
One solution offered to the paradox of the value is through the theory of marginal utility proposed by Carl Menger, one of the founders of the Austrian School of economics.

As William Barber put it, human volition, the human subject, was &quot;brought to the centre of the stage&quot; by marginalist economics, as a bargaining tool. Neoclassical economists sought to clarify choices open to producers and consumers in market situations, and thus &quot;fears that cleavages in the economic structure might be unbridgeable could be suppressed&quot;.

Without denying the applicability of the Austrian theory of value as &quot;subjective&quot; only, within certain contexts of price behavior, the Polish economist Oskar Lange felt it was necessary to attempt a serious &quot;integration&quot; of the insights of classical political economy with neo-classical economics. This would then result in a much more realistic theory of price and of real behavior in response to prices. Marginalist theory lacked anything like a theory of the social framework of real market functioning, and criticism sparked off by the capital controversy initiated by Piero Sraffa revealed that most of the foundational tenets of the marginalist theory of value either reduced to tautologies, or that the theory was true only if counter-factual conditions applied.

One insight often ignored in the debates about price theory is something that businessmen are keenly aware of: in different markets, prices may not function according to the same principles except in some very abstract (and therefore not very useful) sense. From the classical political economists to Michał Kalecki it was known that prices for industrial goods behaved differently from prices for agricultural goods, but this idea could be extended further to other broad classes of goods and services.

==Price as productive human labour time==
Marxists assert that value derives from the volume of socially necessary labour time exerted in the creation of an object. This value does not relate to price in a simple manner, and the difficulty of the conversion of the mass of values into the actual prices is known as the transformation problem. However, many recent Marxists deny that any problem exists. Marx was not concerned with proving that prices derive from values. In fact, he admonished the other classical political economists (like Ricardo and Smith) for trying to make this proof. Rather, for Marx, price equals the cost of production (capital-cost and labor-costs) plus the average rate of profit. So if the average rate of profit (return on capital investment) is 22% then prices would reflect cost-of-production plus 22%. The perception that there is a transformation problem in Marx stems from the injection of Walrasian equilibrium theory into Marxism where there is no such thing as equilibrium.

==Confusion between prices and costs of production==
Price is commonly confused with the notion of cost of production, as in &quot;I paid a high cost for buying my new plasma television&quot;; but technically these are different concepts. Price is what a buyer pays to acquire products from a seller. Cost of production concerns the seller&#x27;s expenses (e.g., manufacturing expense) in producing the product being exchanged with a buyer. For marketing organizations seeking to make a profit, the hope is that price will exceed cost of production so that the organization can see financial gain from the transaction.

Finally, while pricing is a topic central to a company&#x27;s profitability, pricing decisions are not limited to for-profit companies. The behavior of non-profit organizations, such as charities, educational institutions and industry trade groups, also involves setting prices. For instance, charities seeking to raise money may set different &quot;target&quot; levels for donations that reward donors with increases in status (e.g., name in newsletter), gifts or other benefits; likewise educational and cultural nonprofits often price seats for events in theatres, auditoriums and stadiums. Furthermore, while nonprofit organizations may not earn a &quot;profit&quot;, by definition, it is the case that many nonprofits may desire to maximize &quot;net revenue&quot;—total revenue less total cost—for various programs and activities, such as selling seats to theatrical and cultural performances.

==Price point==
The price of an item is also called the &quot;price point&quot;, especially if it refers to stores that set a limited number of price points. For example, Dollar General is a general store or &quot;five and dime&quot; store that sets price points only at even amounts, such as exactly one, two, three, five, or ten dollars (among others). Other stores have a policy of setting most of their prices ending in 99 cents or pence. Other stores (such as dollar stores, pound stores, euro stores, 100-yen stores, and so forth) only have a single price point ($1, £1, €1, ¥100), but in some cases, that price may purchase more than one of some very small items.
 The term &quot;price point&quot; is also used to describe non-linear areas of the price curve.

== Market price ==
In economics, the market price is the economic price for which a good or service is offered in the marketplace. It is of interest mainly in the study of microeconomics. Market value and market price are equal only under conditions of market efficiency, equilibrium, and rational expectations. Market price is measured during a specific period of time and is greatly affected by the supply and demand for a good or service. For example, if demand for a good increases and supply of the good is held constant, the price for the good will rise in a marketplace with open competition.

Under the UK&#x27;s Sale of Goods Act 1979, damages for non-delivery of contracted goods take account of the market price for the goods where there is an available market.

On restaurant menus, the market price (often abbreviated to &quot;m.p.&quot; or &quot;mp&quot;) is written instead of a specific price, meaning &quot;price of dish depends on market price of ingredients, and price is available upon request&quot;, and is particularly used for seafood, notably lobsters and oysters.

==Price databases==
Various price databases exist to increase price transparency in the respective markets. Examples include pricerating.org for B2B service prices in the ICT sector or the :de:Preistransparenzdatenbank in Austria.

==Other terms==
Basic price refers to the amount that a producer receives from a buyer for a unit of a good or service produced, less any taxes payable and plus subsidies payable on that unit as the result of its production or sales. It does not include any producer transport charges which are involved separately.

List price, also known as the manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price (&#x27;MSRP&#x27;), or the recommended retail price (&#x27;RRP&#x27;), or the suggested retail price (&#x27;SRP&#x27;) of a product is the price at which its manufacturer notionally recommends that a retailer sell the product.

Pay what you decide (&#x27;PWYD&#x27;) is a pricing system which allows the purchaser to choose a price to pay based on their circumstances and the benefit which the goods or services provide for them.

Producer price indexes measure the average change in the selling price of domestic producers&#x27; products over time.

Purchase price: refers to the amount paid by the purchaser for receiving a unit of goods or services at the time and place required by the purchaser and any deductible taxes will not be included. The purchase price also include any transport charge for purchase to pick up the goods to a specific location in the required time.

Price optimization is the use of mathematical techniques by a company to determine how customers will respond to different prices for its products and services through different channels.

<text>Lucy the Elephant is a six-story elephant-shaped wood frame and tin clad building, constructed in 1882 by James V. Lafferty in Margate City, New Jersey. Lucy was built with the purpose of promoting real estate sales and attracting tourists to the area. Today, Lucy remains the oldest surviving roadside tourist attraction in America.

== History ==
=== 1882–1899 ===
====Patenting and construction====

On December 5, 1882, the U.S. Patent Office granted James V. Lafferty Patent #268503, giving him the exclusive right to make, use or sell an &quot;animal-shaped building&quot; for a duration of seventeen years. Lafferty funded the design and construction of Lucy at South Atlantic City, now called Margate. He employed Philadelphia architects William Free and J. Mason Kirby for the design of this example of novelty architecture . Lucy was modeled after Jumbo, the famous elephant with &quot;Barnum and Bailey&#x27;s Greatest Show on Earth,&quot; and constructed at a cost of $25,000 - $38,000.

Initially named &quot;Elephant Bazaar&quot;, the structure stands at 65 feet (19.7 m) in height, 60 feet (18.3 m) in length, and 18 feet (5.5 m) in width and weighs about 90 tons. It is currently listed as the 12th tallest statue in the United States. Lucy was constructed with nearly one million pieces of wood, and required 200 kegs of nails, 4 tons of bolts and iron bars; 12,000 square feet of tin covers the exterior. There are 22 windows placed throughout the structure.

====Early use and sale====

Originally, Lafferty brought potential real estate customers to view parcels of land from Lucy&#x27;s howdah (carriage). The howdah offers unique views of Margate, Atlantic City&#x27;s skyline, the beach, and the Atlantic Ocean and it serves as an observation deck for modern day visitors during tours.

The structure was sold to Anton Gertzen of Philadelphia in 1887 and remained in his family until 1970. Anton&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Sophia Gertzen, reportedly dubbed the structure &quot;Lucy the Elephant&quot; in 1902. The shape of Lucy&#x27;s head is characteristic of an Asian elephant, but only males have tusks. Initially, the elephant was referred to as a male, but eventually became commonly known as a female.

=== 1900–1999 ===

Through the first half of the 20th century, Lucy served as a restaurant, business office, cottage, and tavern (the last closed by Prohibition). The building was depicted on many souvenir postcards, often referred to as &quot;&quot;The Elephant Hotel of Atlantic City&quot;.&quot; (The actual hotel was in a nearby building, not inside the elephant.)

By the 1960s, Lucy had fallen into disrepair and was scheduled for demolition. In 1969, Edwin T. Carpenter and others formed the Margate Civic Association, which later became the &quot;Save Lucy Committee&quot; under Josephine Harron and Sylvia Carpenter. They were given a 30-day deadline to move the edifice or pay for its demolition. Lucy was spared through various fund-raising events, most notably a door-to-door canvassing campaign by volunteers.

On July 20, 1970, Lucy was moved to a city-owned lot, located about 100 yards away. The move took about seven hours and Lucy remained closed to the public for repairs until 1974. The restoration entailed supporting Lucy&#x27;s original wooden frame with new steel and replacing the howdah. A plug of green glass was set into the howdah platform to refract light into Lucy&#x27;s interior.

In 1971, Lucy was added to both the NJRHP (New Jersey Register of Historic Places} and the NRHP (National Register of Historic Places).

In 1976, Lucy was designated a National Historic Landmark during the United States Bicentennial celebration.

=== 2000–present ===

Lucy&#x27;s birthday is commemorated each year on July 20, which includes a fundraising event and celebration of children&#x27;s games and much fanfare.

In 2006, Lucy was struck by lightning, blackening the tips of the tusks. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy made landfall near Margate. Lucy remained unscathed, although the surge reached the building&#x27;s toes and a small booth in the parking lot was blown over.

On July 23, 2016, Lucy&#x27;s staff announced the building&#x27;s fake candidacy for President of the United States at a celebration for her 135th birthday. In 2016, Lucy had 135,000 visitors at the site, 35,000 of whom took the guided tour.

On February 27, 2020, Lucy began allowing overnight stays. Lucy was listed on Airbnb for $138 per night on March 17, 18 and 19, 2020. It marked the first time Lucy had been inhabited by humans since it was rented as a home in the early 1900s.

In August 2021, the Save Lucy Committee announced a plan to repair and replace the metal exterior skin after receiving a $500,000 grant from the National Park Service. The grant was based on results of a 2021 inspection that revealed that more than half of Lucy&#x27;s metal skin had degraded beyond repair. The project was partially funded by a grant from the Preserve New Jersey Preservation Fund administered by the New Jersey Historic Trust. Lucy temporarily closed on September 20, 2021, with a reopening date set for Memorial Day 2022. After delays, Lucy reopened on December 28, 2022. The overall cost of the restoration was $2.4 million, a substantial increase from initial projections.

On January 5, 2023, the City of Margate approved a plan to create a visitor&#x27;s center on Lucy&#x27;s existing site. The proposed 2-story building is designed to include a retail area, information and displays, meeting spaces, and restrooms. The new structure will be located on the site of the existing gift shop and would be elevated to meet current flood codes.

In 2023, Lucy booked a new record high of 42,267 tours, surpassing the previous record set in 2018. 

On August 12, 2024, a $500,000 federal grant to fund the restoration of Lucy&#x27;s interior spaces was announced.

== Other structures by Lafferty ==

=== Elephantine Colossus (1885–1896) ===

The &quot;Elephantine Colossus&quot; or &quot;Elephant Hotel&quot;, at Coney Island amusement park in Brooklyn, New York, stood 122 feet (37.2 m) tall, approximately twice the size of Lucy, with seven floors of rooms, and legs 60 feet in circumference. With the exception of the number and relative size of the windows, and the design of the howdah, its exterior was a nearly exact scaled-up replication of Lucy. It held a cigar store in one leg and a diorama in another, hotel rooms within the elephant proper, and an observation area at the top with panoramic sea views. It burned down in 1896.

=== Light of Asia (1884–1900) ===

&quot;Light of Asia&quot; (dubbed &quot;Old Jumbo&quot; by locals) opened in Cape May in 1884, and was a slightly smaller version of Lucy. It was not successful and was torn down within 16 years. Lafferty was not directly involved with the construction but granted patent rights to Theodore M. Rieger, a real estate developer like himself, who sought to do for Cape May what Lafferty did with Lucy for Atlantic City It is unclear whether the Light of Asia matched the quality of the other buildings; the only known surviving photo of &quot;Light of Asia&quot; appears to have been taken while still under construction with no metal skin and an incomplete head, and with yet another different howdah design. A video presented to visitors inside Lucy in 2009 includes that same photo with the narration describing it as Cape May&#x27;s &quot;inferior rendition&quot; of Lucy.

=== Prospectus for 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition ===

A prospectus was published in 1892 by Kirby (while Lafferty still owned the patent) for a fourth building, even larger than Elephantine Colossus and with a moving trunk, eyeballs, ears and tail as well as a Calliope in the throat, to be built for the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. No actual construction was ever attempted.

<doc id="211305" wikidata="Q84090" url="?curid=211305" title="Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran">
<text>The Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran (officially, the &quot;Major Papal, Patriarchal and Roman Archbasilica, Cathedral of the Most Holy Saviour and Saints John the Baptist and the Evangelist in Lateran, Mother and Head of All Churches in Rome and in the World&quot;, and commonly known as the Lateran Basilica or Saint John Lateran) is the Catholic cathedral of the Diocese of Rome in the city of Rome, and serves as the seat of the bishop of Rome, the pope. The only &quot;&quot;arch&quot;basilica&quot; in the world, it lies outside of Vatican City proper, which is located approximately northwest. Nevertheless, as properties of the Holy See, the archbasilica and its adjoining edifices enjoy an extraterritorial status from Italy, pursuant to the terms of the Lateran Treaty of 1929. Dedicated to the Christ, in honor of John the Baptist and John the Evangelist, the place name, (Lateran) comes from an ancient Roman family (&quot;gens&quot;), whose palace (&quot;domus&quot;) grounds occupied the site; the adjacent Lateran Palace was the primary residence of the pope until the Middle Ages.

The church is the oldest and highest ranking of the four major papal basilicas as well as one of the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome. Founded in 324, it is the oldest public church in the city of Rome, and the oldest basilica of the Western world. It houses the &quot;cathedra&quot; of the Roman bishop, and has the title of ecumenical mother church of the Catholic faithful. The building deteriorated during the Middle Ages and was badly damaged by two fires in the 14th century. It was rebuilt in the late 16th century during the reign of Pope Sixtus V. The new structure&#x27;s interior was renovated in the late 17th century, and its façade was completed in 1735 under Pope Clement XII.

The most recent Rector is currently Cardinal Archpriest Baldassare Reina, Vicar General for the Diocese of Rome since October 6, 2024. The president of the French Republic, currently Emmanuel Macron, is &quot;ex officio&quot; the &quot;First and Only Honorary Canon&quot; of the archbasilica, a title that the heads of state of France have possessed since King Henry IV.

The large Latin inscription on the façade reads: &quot;Clemens XII Pont Max Anno V Christo Salvatori In Hon SS Ioan Bapt et Evang&quot;. This abbreviated inscription translates as: &quot;The Supreme Pontiff Clement XII, in the fifth year [of his Pontificate, dedicated this building] to Christ the Savior, in honor of Saints John the Baptist and [John] the Evangelist&quot;. The inscription indicates, with its full title (see below), that the archbasilica was originally dedicated to Christ the Savior and, centuries later, rededicated in honor of Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist. Christ the Savior remains its primary dedication, and its titular feast day is 6 August, the Transfiguration of Christ. As the cathedral of the pope as bishop of Rome, it ranks superior to all other churches of the Catholic Church, including Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

==Name==
The archbasilica&#x27;s Latin name is &#x27;, which in English is the Archbasilica of the Most Holy Savior and Saints John the Baptist and John the Evangelist at the Lateran, and in Italian &#x27;.

==History==
===Lateran Palace===

The archbasilica stands over the remains of the &quot;Castra Nova equitum singularium&quot;, the &quot;New Fort of the Roman imperial cavalry bodyguards&quot;. The fort was established by Septimius Severus in AD 193. Following the victory of Emperor Constantine the Great over Maxentius (for whom the &quot;Equites singulares augusti&quot;, the emperor&#x27;s mounted bodyguards had fought) at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, the guard was abolished and the fort demolished. Substantial remains of the fort lie directly beneath the nave.

The remainder of the site was occupied during the early Roman Empire by the palace of the &quot;gens&quot; Laterani. Sextius Lateranus was the first plebeian to attain the rank of consul, and the Laterani served as administrators for several emperors. One of the Laterani, Consul-designate Plautius Lateranus, became famous for being accused by Nero of conspiracy against the Emperor. The accusation resulted in the confiscation and redistribution of his properties.

The Lateran Palace fell into the hands of the Emperor when Constantine the Great married his second wife Fausta, sister of Maxentius. Known by that time as the &quot;Domus Faustae&quot; or &quot;House of Fausta&quot;, the Lateran Palace was eventually given to the Bishop of Rome by Constantine the Great during the pontificate of Pope Miltiades, in time to host a synod of bishops in 313 that was convened to challenge the Donatist schism, declaring Donatism to be heresy. The palace basilica was converted and extended, becoming the residence of Pope Sylvester I, eventually becoming the Cathedral of Rome, the seat of the Popes as the Bishops of Rome.

===Early Church===
Pope Sylvester I presided over the official dedication of the archbasilica and the adjacent Lateran Palace in 324, changing the name from &quot;Domus Fausta&quot; to &quot;Domus Dei&quot; (&quot;House of God&quot;), with a dedication to Christ the Savior (&quot;Christo Salvatori&quot;). When a &quot;cathedra&quot; became a symbol of episcopal authority, the papal &quot;cathedra&quot; was placed in its interior, rendering it the cathedral of the Pope as Bishop of Rome. When Gregory the Great sent the Gregorian mission to England under Augustine of Canterbury, some original churches in Canterbury took the Roman plan as a model, dedicating a church both to Christ as well as one to Saint Paul, outside the walls of the city. The church name &quot;Christ Church&quot;, so common for churches around the world today in Anglophone Anglican contexts, originally came from this Roman church, central to pre-medieval Christian identity.

The anniversary of the dedication of the church has been observed as a feast since the 12th century. In the General Roman Calendar of the Catholic Church, 9 November is the feast of the Dedication of the (Arch)Basilica of the Lateran (&quot;Dedicatio Basilicae Lateranensis&quot;), referred to in older texts as the &quot;Dedication of the Basilica of the Most Holy Savior&quot;.

===The Middle Ages===
On the archbasilica&#x27;s front wall between the main portals is a plaque inscribed with the words (&quot;Most Holy Lateran Church, mother and head of all the churches in the city and the world&quot;); a visible indication of the declaration that the basilica is the &quot;mother church&quot; of all the world. In the twelfth century the canons of the Lateran claimed that the high altar housed the Ark of the Covenant and several holy objects from Jerusalem. The basilica was thus presented as the Temple of the New Covenant.

The archbasilica and Lateran Palace were re-dedicated twice. Pope Sergius III dedicated them in honor of Saint John the Baptist in the 10th century, occasioned by the newly consecrated baptistry of the archbasilica. Pope Lucius II dedicated them in honor of John the Evangelist in the 12th century. Thus, Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist became co-patrons of the archbasilica, while the primary Titular is still Christ the Savior, as the inscription in the entrance indicates and as is traditional for patriarchal cathedrals. Consequently, the archbasilica remains dedicated to the Savior, and its titular feast is the Feast of the Transfiguration of Christ on 6 August. The archbasilica became the most important shrine of the two Saint Johns, albeit infrequently jointly venerated. In later years, a Benedictine monastery was established in the Lateran Palace, and was devoted to serving the archbasilica and the two saints.

Every pope, beginning with Pope Miltiades, occupied the Lateran Palace until the reign of the French Pope Clement V, who in 1309 transferred the seat of the papacy to Avignon, a papal fiefdom that was an enclave in France. The Lateran Palace has also been the site of five ecumenical councils (see Lateran councils).

===Fires and reconstruction===
During the time the papacy was seated in Avignon, France, the Lateran Palace and the archbasilica deteriorated. Two fires ravaged them in 1307 and 1361. After both fires the pope sent money from Avignon to pay for their reconstruction and maintenance. Nonetheless, the archbasilica and Lateran Palace lost their former splendor. When the papacy returned from Avignon and the pope again resided in Rome, the archbasilica and the Lateran Palace were deemed inadequate considering their accumulated damage. The popes resided at the Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere and later at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. Eventually, the Palace of the Vatican was built adjacent to the Basilica of Saint Peter, which existed since the time of Emperor Constantine I, and the popes began to reside there. It has remained the official residence of the pope, though Pope Francis has chosen to reside in the Domus Sanctae Marthae in the Vatican City, not in the Papal apartments.

There were several attempts at reconstruction of the archbasilica before a definitive program of Pope Sixtus V. Sixtus V hired his favorite architect, Domenico Fontana, to supervise much of the project. The original Lateran Palace was demolished and replaced with a new edifice. On the square in front of the Lateran Palace is San Giovanni Addolorata Hospital and the largest standing ancient Egyptian obelisk in the world, known as the Lateran Obelisk. It weighs an estimated 455 tons. It was commissioned by the Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III and erected by Thutmose IV before the great Karnak temple of Thebes, Egypt. Intended by Emperor Constantine I to be shipped to Constantinople, the very preoccupied Constantius II had it shipped instead to Rome, where it was erected in the Circus Maximus in AD 357. At some time it broke and was buried under the Circus. In the 16th century it was discovered and excavated, and Sixtus V had it re-erected on a new pedestal on 3 August 1588 at its present site.

Further renovation of the interior of the archbasilica ensued under the direction of Francesco Borromini, commissioned by Pope Innocent X. The twelve niches created by his architectural scheme were eventually filled in 1718 with statues of the Apostles, sculpted by the most prominent Roman Rococo sculptors.
The vision of Pope Clement XII for reconstruction was an ambitious one in which he launched a competition to design a new façade. More than 23 architects competed, mostly working in the then-current Baroque idiom. The putatively impartial jury was chaired by Sebastiano Conca, president of the Roman Academy of Saint Luke. The winner of the competition was Alessandro Galilei.

The façade as it appears today was completed in 1735. It reads in Latin: &quot;Clemens XII Pont Max Anno V Christo Salvatori In Hon SS Ioan Bapt et Evang&quot;; this highly abbreviated inscription is expanded thus: &quot;Clemens XII, Pont[ifex] Max[imus], [in] Anno V, [dedicavit hoc aedificium] Christo Salvatori, in hon[orem] [sanctorum] Ioan[is] Bapt[tistae] et Evang[elistae]&quot;. This translates as &quot;Pope Clement XII, Pontifex Maximus, in the fifth year of his reign, dedicated this building to Christ the Savior, in honor of Saints John the Baptist and John the Evangelist&quot;. Galilei&#x27;s façade removed all vestiges of traditional, ancient, basilical architecture and imparted a neo-classical facade.

===World War II===
During the Second World War, the Lateran and its related buildings were used under Pope Pius XII as a safe haven from the Nazis and Italian Fascists for numbers of Jews and other refugees. Among those who found shelter there were Meuccio Ruini, Alcide De Gasperi, Pietro Nenni and others. The Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul and the sixty orphan refugees they cared for were ordered to leave their convent on the Via Carlo Emanuele. The Sisters of Maria Bambina, who staffed the kitchen at the Pontifical Major Roman Seminary at the Lateran offered a wing of their convent. The grounds also housed Italian soldiers.

Vincenzo Fagiolo and Pietro Palazzini, vice-rector of the seminary, were recognized by Yad Vashem for their efforts to assist Jews.

==Architecture==
===History===
An apse lined with mosaics and open to the air still preserves the memory of one of the most famous halls of the ancient palace, the &quot;Triclinium&quot; of Pope Leo III, which was the state banqueting hall. The existing structure is not ancient, but some portions of the original mosaics may have been preserved in the tripartite mosaic of its niche. In the center Christ gives to the Apostles their mission; on the left he gives the keys of the kingdom of heaven to Pope Sylvester I and the Labarum to Emperor Constantine I; and on the right Peter gives the papal stole to Pope Leo III and the standard to Charlemagne.

Some few remains of the original buildings may still be traced in the city walls outside the Gate of Saint John, and a large wall decorated with paintings was uncovered in the 18th century within the archbasilica behind the Lancellotti Chapel. A few traces of older buildings were also revealed during the excavations of 1880, when the work of extending the apse was in progress, but nothing of importance was published.

A great many donations from the Popes and other benefactors to the archbasilica are recorded in the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, and its splendor at an early period was such that it became known as the &quot;Basilica Aurea&quot;, or &quot;Golden Basilica&quot;. This splendor drew upon it the attack of the Vandals, who stripped it of all its treasures. Pope Leo I restored it around AD 460, and it was again restored by Pope Hadrian I.

In 897, it was almost totally destroyed by an earthquake: &quot;ab altari usque ad portas cecidit&quot; (&quot;it collapsed from the altar to the doors&quot;). The damage was so extensive that it was difficult to trace the lines of the old building, but these were mostly respected and the new building was of the same dimensions as the old. This second basilica stood for 400 years before it burned in 1308. It was rebuilt by Pope Clement V and Pope John XXII. It burned once more in 1360, and was rebuilt by Pope Urban V.

Through vicissitudes the archbasilica retained its ancient form, being divided by rows of columns into aisles, and having in front a peristyle surrounded by colonnades with a fountain in the middle, the conventional Late Antique format that was also followed by the old Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The façade had three windows and was embellished with a mosaic representing Christ as the Savior of the world.

The porticoes were frescoed, probably not earlier than the 12th century, commemorating the Roman fleet under Vespasian, the taking of Jerusalem, the Baptism of Emperor Constantine I and his &quot;Donation&quot; of the Papal States to the Catholic Church. Inside the archbasilica the columns no doubt ran, as in all other basilicas of the same date, the whole length of the church, from east to west.

In one of the rebuildings, probably that which was carried out by Pope Clement V, a transverse nave was introduced, imitated no doubt from the one which had been added, long before this, to the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. Probably at this time the archbasilica was enlarged.

Some portions of the older buildings survive. Among them the pavement of medieval Cosmatesque work, and the statues of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, now in the cloister. The graceful ciborium over the high altar, which looks out of place in its present surroundings, dates from 1369. The throne of red marble on which the Popes sat, is now in the Vatican Museums. It was part of a pair, but the other was plundered and taken away by Napoleon and is now in the Louvre. Another papal throne, the &quot;sedia stercoraria&quot;, is now in the Lateran Cloister. It owes its unsavory name to the anthem sung at previous Papal coronations, &quot;De &quot;stercore&quot; erigens pauperem&quot; (&quot;lifting up the poor out of the dunghill&quot;, from Psalm 112).

From the 5th century, there were seven oratories surrounding the archbasilica. These before long were incorporated into the church. The devotion of visiting these oratories, which was maintained through the Mediaeval Ages, gave rise to the similar devotion of the seven altars, still common in many churches of Rome and elsewhere.

Of the façade by Alessandro Galilei (1735), the cliché assessment has been that it is the façade of a palace, not of a church. Galilei&#x27;s front, which is a screen across the older front creating a narthex or vestibule, does express the nave and double aisles of the archbasilica, which required a central bay wider than the rest of the sequence. Galilei provided it, without abandoning the range of identical arch-headed openings, by extending the central window by flanking columns that support the arch, in the familiar Serlian motif.

By bringing the central bay forward very slightly, and capping it with a pediment that breaks into the roof balustrade, Galilei provided an entrance doorway on a more than colossal scale, framed in the paired colossal Corinthian pilasters that tie together the façade in the manner introduced at Michelangelo&#x27;s palace on the Campidoglio.

In the narthex of the church, is a 4th-century statue of emperor Constantine. It was found elsewhere in Rome, and moved to this site by order of Pope Clement XII.

Between the archbasilica and the city wall there was a great monastery, in which dwelt the community of monks whose duty it was to provide the services in the archbasilica. The only part of it which still survives is the 13th century cloister, surrounded by columns of inlaid marble. They are of a style intermediate between the Romanesque proper and the Gothic, and are the work of Vassellectus and the Cosmati.

===Statues of the Apostles===
The twelve niches created in Francesco Borromini&#x27;s architecture were left vacant for decades. When in 1702 Pope Clement XI and Benedetto Cardinal Pamphili, archpriests of the archbasilica, announced their grand scheme for twelve larger-than-life sculptures of the Apostles (Judas Iscariot replaced by Saint Paul, instead of Saint Matthias) to fill the niches, the commission was opened to all the premier sculptors of late Baroque Rome. Each statue was to be sponsored by an illustrious prince with the Pope himself sponsoring that of Saint Peter and Cardinal Pamphili that of Saint John the Evangelist. Most of the sculptors were given a sketch drawn by Pope Clement&#x27;s favorite painter, Carlo Maratta, to which they were to adhere, but with the notable exception being Pierre Le Gros the Younger, who successfully refused to sculpt to Maratta&#x27;s design and consequently was not given a sketch.

The sculptors and their sculptures follow and are dated according to Conforti (the dates reflect archival findings but models for most must have existed before):

*Pierre-Étienne Monnot
**&quot;Saint Paul&quot; (1704–1708)
**&quot;Saint Peter&quot; (1704–1711)
*Francesco Moratti
**&quot;Saint Simon&quot; (1704–1709)
*Lorenzo Ottoni
**&quot;Saint Jude Thaddeus&quot; (1704–1709)
*Giuseppe Mazzuoli
**&quot;Saint Philip&quot; (1705–1711)
*Pierre Le Gros
**&quot;Saint Thomas&quot; (1705–1711)
**&quot;Saint Bartholomew&quot; (–1712)
*Angelo de&#x27; Rossi
**&quot;Saint James the Lesser&quot; (1705–1711)
*Camillo Rusconi
**&quot;Saint Andrew&quot; (1705–1709)
**&quot;Saint John&quot; (1705–1711)
**&quot;Saint Matthew&quot; (1711–1715)
**&quot;Saint James the Greater&quot; (1715–1718)

===Papal tombs===

There are six extant papal tombs inside the archbasilica: Alexander III (right aisles), Pope Sergius IV (right aisles), Pope Clement XII Corsini (left aisle), Pope Martin V (in front of the confessio); Pope Innocent III (right transept); and Pope Leo XIII (left transept), by G. Tadolini (1907). The last of these, Pope Leo XIII, was the last pope not to be entombed in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica, .

Twelve additional papal tombs were constructed in the archbasilica starting in the 10th century, but were destroyed during the two fires that ravaged it in 1308 and 1361. The remains of these charred tombs were gathered and reburied in a polyandrion. The popes whose tombs were destroyed are: Pope John X (914–928), Pope Agapetus II (946–955), Pope John XII (955–964), Pope Paschal II (1099–1118), Pope Callixtus II (1119–1124), Pope Honorius II (1124–1130), Pope Celestine II (1143–1144), Pope Lucius II (1144–1145), Pope Anastasius IV (1153–1154), Pope Clement III (1187–1191), Pope Celestine III (1191–1198), and Pope Innocent V (1276). Popes who reigned during this period, whose tombs are unknown, and who may have been buried in the archbasilica include Pope John XVII (1003), Pope John XVIII (1003–1009), and Pope Alexander II (1061–1073). Pope John X was the first pope buried within the walls of Rome, and was granted a prominent burial due to rumors that he was murdered by Theodora during a historical period known as the . Cardinals Vincenzo Santucci and Carlo Colonna are also buried in the archbasilica.

The skull of Saint Peter is also claimed to reside in the archbasilica since at least the ninth century, alongside the skull of Saint Paul.

===Baptistery and Holy Stairs===
The octagonal Lateran baptistery stands somewhat apart from the archbasilica. It was founded by Pope Sixtus III, perhaps on an earlier structure, for a legend arose that Emperor Constantine I was baptized there and enriched the edifice. The baptistery was for many generations the only baptistery in Rome, and its octagonal structure, centered upon the large basin for full immersions, provided a model for others throughout Italy, and even an iconic motif of illuminated manuscripts known as &quot;the fountain of life&quot;.

The &quot;Scala Sancta&quot;, or Holy Stairs, are white marble steps encased in wooden ones. They supposedly form the staircase which once led to the praetorium of Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem and which, therefore, were sanctified by the footsteps of Jesus Christ during His Passion. The marble stairs are visible through openings in the wooden risers. Their translation from Jerusalem to the Lateran Palace in the 4th century is credited to Saint Empress Helena, the mother of the then-Emperor Constantine I. In 1589, Pope Sixtus V relocated the steps to their present location in front of the ancient palatine chapel named the Sancta Sanctorum. Ferraù Fenzoni completed some of the frescoes on the walls.

<text>Live from New York City, 1967 is the second live album by Simon &amp; Garfunkel, recorded at Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center in New York City, on 22 January 1967. The album was released on the Columbia Legacy CK 61513 label on 16 July 2002.

The performance was the first official live release by Simon and Garfunkel recorded in the 1960s. Recorded in 1967 prior to the duo&#x27;s work on the soundtrack to &quot;The Graduate&quot;. It features many of the duo&#x27;s early hits and album tracks, such as &quot;Leaves That Are Green&quot;, &quot;He Was My Brother&quot;, and &quot;For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her&quot;.

Four of the tracks from the album were previously released on 1997&#x27;s &quot;Old Friends&quot; box-set which contained five songs from the Lincoln Center concert, though &quot;Red Rubber Ball&quot; was not included on this release.

In contrast to the duo&#x27;s other official live releases (&quot;The Concert in Central Park&quot;, &quot;Old Friends: Live on Stage&quot;, and &quot;Live 1969&quot;), this recording features Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel performing alone. This album does not capture the same show as the bootleg &quot;Live from New York City, 1966&quot;, despite similar material and packaging.

<text>Sir John Wildman (2 June 1693) was an English politician and soldier.

==Biography==

Wildman was born to Jeffrey and Margaret Wildman (née Poaker) in the Norfolk town of Wymondham. He was christened at Wymondham on 24 January 1621, the youngest of three children. John&#x27;s mother died soon after he was born, as his father Jeffrey, who was a butcher, remarried (to Dorothie Leverich) on 2 January 1622. John may have been educated as a sizar (a poor scholar who had to work as a servant to pay his way) at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. A John Wildman of Norfolk received a BA in 1641 and an MA from Cambridge in 1644. Wildman may have had legal training as he later described himself as an attorney or solicitor.

===Civil War===
In the English Civil War Wildman served briefly under Sir Thomas Fairfax. He became prominent, however, as a civilian adviser to the Army agitators, being in 1647 one of the leaders of that section of the army that opposed all compromise with King Charles I.

Wildman&#x27;s first known entry into politics came in early July 1647, when he and other backers of the New Model Army journeyed from London to the army&#x27;s headquarters in Reading to deliver a supportive address to the army&#x27;s leaders. Later that month, he and other army allies (including William Walwyn and Maximilian Petty) were invited by the army to attend the Reading Debates and to comment on the Heads of Proposals, the army&#x27;s new peace plan. The London delegation grew concerned that the Heads made too many concessions to the King and Lords, and on 24 July they drafted a manifesto to Lord General Sir Thomas Fairfax warning that fundamental principles of governance were in danger of being betrayed. This marked an important shift, in which discontented elements in the army and London began to turn against the army leadership and to agitate for more radical reform. Wildman would be one of the central ringleaders of this movement.

In December 1647 Wildman wrote a pamphlet, &quot;Putney Projects&quot;, that attacked Oliver Cromwell and Henry Ireton for betraying the New Model Army&#x27;s Declaration of 14 June 1647 in the Heads of Proposals. He may have written parts of &quot;The Case of the Army Stated&quot;, and he put the views of his associates before the Council of the Army at the Putney Debates that were partly held in Putney parish church between 28 October and 11 November 1647. The soldiers, explained Wildman, &quot;desired me to be their mouth&quot;, and he argued on their behalf that the engagements entered into with the King should be cancelled, monarchy and the House of Lords abolished, and manhood suffrage established. He also demanded that the officers should accept an &quot;Agreement of the People&quot; just put forth by the five regiments, a document that some modern historians consider he had the principal hand in drafting.

Wildman and John Lilburne attempted to build a movement to campaign for the Agreement of the People. The Earl of Clarendon alleged that preparations were made &quot;for his trial and towards his execution&quot;. On 18 January 1648 George Masterson, minister of Shoreditch informed against Wildman and Lieutenant-Colonel John Lilburne for promoting a seditious petition. Wildman and Lilburne were summoned to the bar of the House of Commons, which committed both men to Newgate Prison. Bail was refused, and, in spite of frequent petitions for their release, they remained in prison until 2 August 1648. The historian C.H. Firth stated in the DNB (1900) that Wildman&#x27;s speech at the bar of the house was very ineffective, and the pamphlet he published in answer to Masterson&#x27;s charges, entitled &quot;Truth&#x27;s Triumph&quot;, was derisively refuted by Masterson in the &quot;Triumph Stained&quot;.

On the release of the two prisoners the Levellers held a meeting at the Nag&#x27;s Head tavern, in which, says Lilburne, &quot;the just ends of the war were as exactly laid open by Mr. John Wildman as ever I heard in my life&quot;, and the party agreed to oppose the execution or deposition of the king until the fundamental principles of the future constitution were settled. To that end a new &quot;Agreement of the People&quot; was drawn up by sixteen representatives of different parties, but, after long debates in the Council of Officers, it was so altered by the officers that Lilburne and other leaders of the levellers refused to accept it, and published in May 1649 a rival &quot;Agreement&quot;, drawn up by themselves.

It seems that Wildman was satisfied with what the Council of Officers were suggesting because he abandoned further agitation, and in the winter of 1648–49 he joined the New Model Army as major in the regiment of horse of Colonel John Reynolds. However he did not accompany the regiment to Ireland in August 1649.

===Commonwealth===
Wildman remained in England and became one of the greatest speculators in the forfeited lands of royalists, clergy, and Roman Catholics. His purchases of land, either for himself or for others, were scattered over at least twenty counties. For himself he bought in 1655 the manor of Beckett near Shrivenham (then in Berkshire, now Oxfordshire), and other lands adjoining it, from his friend Henry Marten.

In 1654 Wildman was elected to the First Protectorate Parliament as MP for Scarborough, but he was probably one of those excluded for refusing the engagement not to attempt to alter the government. By the end of 1654 he was plotting the overthrow of the Protector Oliver Cromwell by means of a combined rising of Royalists and Levellers. Consequently, he was arrested on 10 February 1655 at the village of Easton, near Marlborough, Wiltshire, while dictating &quot;A Declaration of the free and well-affected People of England now in Arms against the Tyrant Oliver Cromwell, esq&quot; to his secretary William Parker. He was sent a prisoner first to Chepstow Castle, and afterwards to the Tower of London. Nearly a year and a half later, on 26 June 1656 a petition begging for Wildman&#x27;s release was presented to the Protector by various persons engaged in business speculations with him, and on giving security for £10,000 he was provisionally set free.

For the rest of the Protectorate Wildman kept out of prison, though he still continued in intrigue. He was in frequent communication with Royalist agents, whom he contrived to persuade that he was working for the King&#x27;s cause, and he signed the address presented to Charles II on behalf of the Levellers in July 1656. It is fairly certain that Cromwell&#x27;s government was aware of these intrigues, and it is probable that Wildman purchased impunity by giving information of some kind to Cromwell&#x27;s spy master John Thurloe. For this reason Edward Hyde and the more prudent Royalists did not trust him. C.H. Firth speculated that Wildman&#x27;s political object in this complicated web of treachery was probably to overthrow Cromwell, and to set up in his place either a republic or a monarchy limited by some elaborate constitution of his own devising.

In the late 1650s Wildman used his new wealth to acquire a victualing house in Bow Street, Covent Garden, at the sign of the Nonsuch, which he entrusted to his servant William Parker. At the Nonsuch, Wildman and Parker allegedly hosted a regular gathering of the Commonwealth Club, a Republican club, which supposedly attracted diehard commonwealthsmen such as Henry Marten and Arthur Hesilrig as well as the political theorist James Harrington. Wildman was also in 1659 a member of James Harrington&#x27;s Rota Club, a Republican debating club which determined its decisions by ballot.

In December 1659, when the Army had turned out the Long Parliament, Wildman was employed by the Council of Officers, in conjunction with Bulstrode Whitelocke, Charles Fleetwood, and others, to draw a form of government for a free state. At the same time he was plotting to overthrow the rule of the Army, and offered to raise three thousand horse if Whitelocke, who was constable of Windsor Castle, would declare for a free commonwealth. Whitelocke declined, and Wildman, seeing which way the tide was running, helped Colonel Henry Ingoldsby to seize the castle for the Long Parliament. On 28 December 1659 the House promised that the good service of those who had assisted Ingoldsby should be duly rewarded,

===Restoration===
At the Restoration of the English Monarchy information against Wildman was presented to Parliament, but thanks to these recent exploits and to his hostility to Cromwell, he escaped untroubled. In 1661 complaints were made that the officials of the General Post Office were his creatures, and he was accused of suspicious dealings with the letters. He was also suspected of complicity in the republican plots against the government, and on 26 November 1661 he was examined and committed to close imprisonment. For nearly six years he was a prisoner, first in the Tower, then in St Mary&#x27;s, Isles of Scilly, and finally in Pendennis Castle. His captivity was shared by his son, and, according to Gilbert Burnet, he spent his time in studying law and physic.

After the fall of Clarendon, on 1 October 1667, Wildman was released on giving security to attempt nothing against the government. In December it was even rumoured that he was to be a member of the committee of accounts about to be appointed by Parliament, through the influence of the George, Duke of Buckingham. Sir William Coventry expressed his wonder at the proposal to Samuel Pepys, Wildman having been &quot;a false fellow to everybody&quot;, and Sir John Talbot openly denounced Wildman in the House of Commons. The scheme fell through, and on 7 July 1670 Wildman obtained a license for himself, his wife and son to travel abroad for his health. His intimacy with Buckingham continued, and he was one of the trustees in whom on 24 December 1675 the unsold portion of Buckingham&#x27;s estate was vested.

On his return to England, Wildman plunged once more into political intrigues, though keeping himself at first cautiously in the background. In the plots for armed resistance to the King which followed the dissolution of Charles II&#x27;s last parliament in 1681 he appears to have played a considerable part. Wildman was closely associated with Algernon Sidney, both of whom were distrusted by the leaders of the Scottish malcontents, and by the English noblemen concerned, as too republican in their aims. Wildman drew up a manifesto to be published at the time of the intended insurrection, and, though not one of the &quot;public managers&quot;, was privately consulted upon all occasions and applied unto as their &quot;chief oracle&quot;; He was also credited with suggesting the assassination of the King and the Duke of York, &quot;whom he expressed by the name of stags that would not be impaled, but leapt over all the fences which the care and wisdom of the authors of the constitution had made to restrain them from committing spoils&quot;. On 26 June 1683 he was committed to the Tower of London for complicity in the Rye House Plot, but allowed out on bail on 24 November following, and finally discharged on 12 February 1684. The chief witness against him was Lord Howard, who testified that Wildman undertook to furnish the rebels with some guns, which the discovery of two small field-pieces at his house seemed to confirm.

When the reign of James II of England began, Wildman, undeterred by his narrow escape, entered into communication with the Duke of Monmouth, and was his chief agent in England. He sent a certain Robert Cragg, alias Smith, to Monmouth and the English exiles in Holland. According to Cragg, Monmouth complained of Wildman&#x27;s backwardness in providing money for the expedition, and that Wildman would hinder the expedition from coming until Wildman judged the time right. Wildman, on the other hand, complained that Monmouth and a small group of exiles were resolved &quot;to conclude the scheme of the government of the nation without the knowledge of any of the people in England&quot;, Other depositions represent him as advising Monmouth to take upon him the title of King, and encouraging him by citing the example of the 2nd Earl of Richmond (who became Henry VII) and Richard III. All accounts agree that he drew back at the last moment, did nothing to get up the promised rising in London, and refused to join Monmouth when he landed. At the beginning of June 1685 Wildman fled, and an order for his arrest was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; for 4–8 June 1685, followed on 26 July by a proclamation summoning him and others to surrender.

===Glorious Revolution===
Wildman, who had escaped to the Netherlands, remained there until the Glorious Revolution, probably living in Amsterdam. He was dissatisfied with the declaration published by the William, Prince of Orange to justify his expedition, regarding it as designed to conciliate the church party in England, and desiring to make it a comprehensive impeachment of the misgovernment of Charles and James. The Charles, Earl of Macclesfield, Lord Mordaunt, and others supported Wildman&#x27;s view, but more moderate counsellors prevailed. With Lord Macclesfield, Wildman embarked on the Prince&#x27;s fleet and landed in England. He wrote many anonymous pamphlets on the crisis, sat in the Convention Parliament called in January 1689 as member for Wootton Bassett and was a frequent speaker.

In the proceedings against Burton and Graham, charged with subornation of evidence in the state trials of the late reign, Wildman was particularly active, bringing in the report of the committee appointed to investigate the case, and representing the Commons at a conference with the House of Lords on the subject.

On 12 April 1689 he was made Postmaster General. But before long strong complaints were made that he was using his position to discredit the Tory adherents of William III by fictitious letters which he pretended to have intercepted; and there were also reports that he was intriguing with Jacobite emissaries. Accordingly, he was summarily dismissed from his post about the end of February 1691. Wildman, however, had been made a freeman of the City of London on 7 December 1689, became an alderman, and was knighted by William III in company with other aldermen at the Guildhall, London on 29 October 1692.

Wildman died on 2 June 1693, aged 72, and is buried at Shrivenham.

==Posterity==

By his will, according to the epitaph on his monument in St. Andrew&#x27;s parish church, Wildman directed:
&quot;that if his executors should think fit there should be some stone of small price set near to his ashes, to signify, without foolish flattery, to his posterity, that in that age there lived a man who spent the best part of his days in prisons, without crimes, being conscious of no offence towards man, for that he so loved his God that he could serve no man&#x27;s will, and wished the liberty and happiness of his country and all mankind&quot;.

Baron Macaulay was less favourable. After describing a fanatical hatred to monarchy as the mainspring of Wildman&#x27;s career, he adds:
&quot;With Wildman&#x27;s fanaticism was joined a tender care for his own safety. He had a wonderful skill in grazing the edge of treason. ... Such was his cunning, that though always plotting, though always known to be plotting, and though long malignantly watched by a vindictive government, he eluded every danger, and died in his bed, after having seen two generations of his accomplices die on the gallows&quot;.

There is an engraved portrait of Wildman by William Faithorne, with the motto &quot;Nil Admirari&quot;.

==Works==
Wildman was the author of numerous pamphlets, nearly all of them either anonymous or published under pseudonyms:
* &quot;Putney Projects; or the Old Serpent in a New Form. By John Lawmind,&quot; 1647.
* &quot;The Case of the Army stated,&quot; 1647 (&quot;Clarke Papers&quot;, i. 347, 356).
* &quot;A Call to all the Soldiers of the Army by the Free People of England, justifying the Proceedings of the Five Regiments,&quot; 1647 (anon.)
* &quot;Truth&#x27;s Triumph,&quot; 1648 (answered by George Masterson in &quot;The Triumph Stained,&quot; 1648).
* &quot;The Law&#x27;s Subversion; or Sir John Maynard&#x27;s Case truly stated. By J. Howldin,&quot; 1648 (cf. , &quot;The Picture of the Council of State&quot;, 1649, pp. 8, 19).
* &quot;London&#x27;s Liberties; or a Learned Argument between Mr. Maynard and Major Wildman,&quot; 1651.

In the &quot;Twelve Collections of Papers relating to the Present Juncture of Affairs in England&quot; (1688–9, 4to), there are several pamphlets probably written by Wildman, viz.: 
*v. 8, &quot;Ten Seasonable Queries proposed by an English Gentleman at Amsterdam to his Friends in England&quot;
*vi. 3, &quot;A Letter to a Friend advising in this Extraordinary Juncture how to free the Nation from Slavery for ever&quot; 
*viii. 5, &quot;Good Advice before it be too late, being a Breviate for the Convention&quot;

Three tracts are attributed to Wildman, jointly with others, in &quot;A Collection of State Tracts, published on occasion of the late Revolution and during the Reign of William III&quot; (1705, 3 vols. fol.), viz.:
* &quot;A Memorial from the English Protestants to the Prince and Princess of Orange&quot; (i. 1)
* &quot;A Defence of the Proceedings of the Late Parliament in England,&quot; anno 1689 (i. 209)
* &quot;An Enquiry or Discourse between a Yeoman of Kent and a Knight of the Shire, upon the Prorogation of Parliament,&quot; &amp;c. (ii. 330).

==Family==
Published accounts have recorded that Wildman&#x27;s first wife was Frances, daughter of Sir Francis Englefield, 2nd Baronet, and his second wife was Lucy, daughter of Lord Lovelace. However, these connections have recently been contested. The History of Parliament - The House of Commons 1640-1660 records that Wildman&#x27;s first wife was Dorothy, daughter of Michael Whitefoot of Hapton in Norfolk, a family noticed in Wildman&#x27;s own will. Wildman&#x27;s second wife was Lucy Richmond, daughter of Anthony Richmond of Idstone, Ashbury, Berkshire, from a family connected to Wildman&#x27;s friend and ally, the Berkshire MP Henry Marten.

Wildman had a son, John, who married Eleanor, daughter of Edward Chute of Bethersden, Kent, in 1676, and died childless in 1710, though he made John Shute, later Viscount Barrington, his chief heir, particularly of Beckett Hall, which the elder Wildman had bought in 1657 from the regicide Henry Marten (see above).

<text>The Papal Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls () is one of Rome&#x27;s four major papal basilicas, along with the basilicas of Saint John in the Lateran, Saint Peter&#x27;s, and Saint Mary Major, as well as one of the city’s Seven Pilgrim Churches. The basilica is the conventual church of the adjacent Benedictine abbey. It lies within Italian territory, but the Holy See owns the basilica and it is part of the Vatican&#x27;s extraterritoriality.

==History==
The basilica was founded by the Roman Emperor Constantine I over the burial place of Paul of Tarsus, where it was said that, after the apostle&#x27;s execution, his followers erected a memorial, called a &quot;cella memoriae&quot;. This first basilica was consecrated by Pope Sylvester in 324.

In 386, Emperor Theodosius I began erecting a much larger and more beautiful basilica with a nave and four aisles with a transept. It was probably consecrated around 402 by Pope Innocent I. The work, including the mosaics, was not completed until Leo I&#x27;s pontificate (440–461). In the 5th century, it was larger than the Old Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The Christian poet Prudentius, who saw it at the time of emperor Honorius (395–423), describes the splendours of the monument in a few expressive lines.

Under Leo I, extensive repair work was carried out following the collapse of the roof on account of fire or lightning. In particular, the transept (i.e. the area around Paul&#x27;s tomb) was elevated and a new main altar and presbytery were installed. This was probably the first time that an altar was placed over the tomb of Saint Paul, which remained untouched, but largely underground given Leo&#x27;s newly elevated floor levels. Leo was also responsible for fixing the triumphal arch and for restoring a fountain in the courtyard (atrium). 

Under Pope Gregory the Great (590–604), the main altar and presbytery were extensively modified. The pavement in the transept was raised and a new altar was placed above the earlier altar erected by Leo I. The position was directly over Saint Paul&#x27;s sarcophagus. 

In that period, there were two monasteries near the basilica: Saint Aristus&#x27;s for men and Saint Stefano&#x27;s for women. Masses were celebrated by a special body of clerics instituted by Pope Simplicius. Over time, the monasteries and the basilica&#x27;s clergy declined; Pope Gregory II restored the former and entrusted the monks with the basilica&#x27;s care.

The basilica was damaged in an earthquake on 29 April 801. Its roof collapsed, but was rebuilt by Leo III.

As it lay outside the Aurelian Walls, the basilica was damaged in the 9th century during a Saracen raid. Consequently, Pope John VIII (872–882) fortified the basilica, the monastery, and the dwellings of the peasantry, forming the town of Johannispolis (Italian: &quot;Giovannipoli&quot;) which existed until 1348, when an earthquake totally destroyed it.

In 937, when Odo of Cluny came to Rome, Alberic II of Spoleto, Patrician of Rome, entrusted the monastery and basilica to his congregation and Odo placed Balduino of Monte Cassino in charge. Pope Gregory VII was abbot of the monastery and in his time Pantaleone, a rich merchant of Amalfi who lived in Constantinople, presented the bronze doors of the basilica maior, which were executed by Constantinopolitan artists; the doors are inscribed with Pantaleone&#x27;s prayer that the &quot;doors of life&quot; may be opened to him. Pope Martin V entrusted it to the monks of the Congregation of Monte Cassino. It was then made an abbey nullius. The abbot&#x27;s jurisdiction extended over the districts of Civitella San Paolo, Leprignano, and Nazzano, all of which formed parishes.
 The graceful cloister of the monastery was erected between 1220 and 1241.

From 1215 until 1964, it was the seat of the Latin Patriarch of Alexandria.

Pope Benedict XIV undertook the restoration of the apse mosaic and the frescoes of the central nave, and commissioned the painter Salvatore Manosilio to continue the series of papal portraits, which at that time ended with Pope Vitalian, who had reigned over a millennium earlier.

On 15 July 1823, a workman repairing the copper gutters of the roof started a fire that led to the near-total destruction of this basilica, which, alone among all the churches of Rome, had preserved much of its original character for 1435 years. More recent studies indicate that the cause of the fire could be different from that indicated by official sources. Marble salvaged from the burnt-out Saint Paul&#x27;s was re-laid for the floor of Santo Stefano del Cacco.

In 1825, Leo XII issued the encyclical &quot;Ad plurimas&quot; encouraging donations for the reconstruction. A few months later, he issued orders that the basilica be rebuilt exactly as it had been when new in the fourth century, though he also stipulated that precious elements from later periods, such as the medieval mosaics and tabernacle, also be repaired and retained. These guidelines proved unrealistic for a variety of reasons and soon ceased to be enforced. The result is a reconstructed basilica that bears only a general resemblance to the original and is by no means identical to it. The reconstruction was initially entrusted to the architect Pasquale Belli, who was succeeded upon his death in 1833 by Luigi Poletti, who supervised the project until his death in 1869 and was responsible for the lion&#x27;s share of the work. Poletti also asked the scientist Angelo Secchi to design an automatic fire detection and extinguishing system, which was later removed. Many elements which had survived the fire were reused in the reconstruction. Many foreign rulers also made contributions. Muhammad Ali Pasha, Viceroy of Egypt gave columns of alabaster, while the Emperor of Russia donated precious malachite and lapis lazuli that was used on some of the altar fronts. The transept and high altar were consecrated by Pope Gregory XVI in October 1840, and that part of the basilica was then re-opened. The entire building was reconsecrated in 1854 in the presence of Pope Pius IX and fifty cardinals. Many features of the building were still to be executed at that date, however, and work ultimately extended into the twentieth century. The quadriporticus looking toward the Tiber was completed by the Italian Government, which declared the church a national monument. On 23 April 1891, an explosion at the gunpowder magazine at Forte Portuense destroyed the basilica&#x27;s stained glass windows.

On 31 May 2005, Pope Benedict XVI ordered the basilica to come under the control of an archpriest and he named Archbishop Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo as its first archpriest.

==Architecture and interior==

The covered portico (or narthex) that precedes the façade is a Neo-classicist addition of the 19th-century reconstruction. On the right is the Holy Door, which is opened only during the Jubilees. On the inside is a second door, known as the Byzantine door, which was present in the pre-19th century basilica; it contains on one side 56 small square engraved bronze panels, and was commissioned in 1070 by Pantaleone, Consul of Amalfi in Constantinople, and putatively cast in Constantinople. It depicts a number of episodes in the life of Christ and the apostles. 

The new basilica has maintained the original structure with one nave and four side aisles. It is long, -wide,
and -high, the second largest in Rome.

The nave&#x27;s 80 columns and its wood and stucco-decorated ceiling are from the 19th century. All that remains of the ancient basilica are the interior portion of the apse with the triumphal arch. The mosaics of the apse were greatly damaged in the 1823 fire; only a few traces were incorporated in the restoration. The 5th-century mosaics of the triumphal arch are original (but also heavily reworked): an inscription in the lower section attest they were done at the time of Leo I, paid by Galla Placidia. The subject portrays the Apocalypse of John, with the bust of Christ in the middle flanked by the 24 Doctors of the Church, surmounted by the flying symbols of the four Evangelists. Saint Peter and Saint Paul are portrayed at the right and left of the arch, the latter pointing downwards (probably to his tomb).

From the inside, the windows may appear to be stained glass, but they are actually translucent alabaster.

The ciborium of the confession of Arnolfo di Cambio (1285) belongs to the 13th century.

In the old basilica each pope had his portrait in a painted frieze extending above the columns separating the aisles from the nave. A 19th-century mosaic version can be seen now. The nave&#x27;s interior walls were also redecorated with painted scenes from Saint Paul&#x27;s life placed between the windows of the clerestory.

South of the transept is the cloister, considered &quot;one of the most beautiful of the Middle Ages&quot;. Built by Vassalletto in 1205–1241, it has double columns of different shapes. Some columns have inlays with golden and colored-glass mosaics; the same decoration can be seen on the architrave and the inner frame of the cloister. Also visible are fragments from the destroyed basilica and ancient sarcophagi, one with scenes of the myth of Apollo.

Outside the Basilica is the original sculpture of &quot;When I was in Prison&quot;, created by Canadian artist Timothy Schmalz as part of the Matthew 25 collection installed throughout Rome on the occasion of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy.

==Tomb of Saint Paul==

According to tradition, Saint Paul&#x27;s body was buried two miles away from the location of his martyrdom, in the sepulchral area along the Ostiense Way, which was owned by a Christian woman named Lucina. A tropaeum was erected on it and quickly became a place of veneration.

Constantine I erected a basilica on the tropaeum&#x27;s site, and the basilica was significantly extended by Theodosius I from 386, into what is now known as Saint Paul Outside the Walls. During the 4th century, Paul&#x27;s remains, excluding the head, were moved into a sarcophagus. (According to church tradition the head rests at the Lateran.) Paul&#x27;s tomb is below a marble tombstone in the basilica&#x27;s crypt, at below the altar. The tombstone bears the Latin inscription (&quot;to Paul the apostle and martyr&quot;). The inscribed portion of the tombstone has three holes, two square and one circular. The circular hole is connected to the tomb by a pipeline, reflecting the Roman custom of pouring perfumes inside the sarcophagus, or to the practice of providing the bones of the dead with libations. The sarcophagus below the tombstone measures long, wide and high.
The discovery of the sarcophagus is mentioned in the chronicle of the Benedictine monastery attached to the basilica, in regard to the 19th century rebuilding. Unlike other sarcophagi found at that time, this was not mentioned in the excavation papers.

On 6 December 2006, it was announced that Vatican archaeologists had confirmed the presence of a white marble sarcophagus beneath the altar, perhaps containing the remains of the Apostle. A press conference held on 11 December 2006 gave more details of the work of excavation, which lasted from 2002 to 22 September 2006, and which had been initiated after pilgrims to the basilica expressed disappointment that the Apostle&#x27;s tomb could not be visited or touched during the Jubilee year of 2000. The sarcophagus was not extracted from its position, so that only one of its two longer sides is visible. 

In 2009 Pope Benedict XVI announced that radiocarbon dating confirmed that the bones in the tomb date from the 1st or 2nd century suggesting that they are indeed Paul&#x27;s.

A curved line of bricks indicating the outline of the apse of the Constantinian basilica was discovered immediately to the west of the sarcophagus, showing that the original basilica had its entrance to the east, like Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the Vatican. The larger 386 basilica that replaced it had the Via Ostiense (the road to Ostia) to the east and so was extended westward, towards the river Tiber, changing the orientation diametrically.

<text>The turacos make up the bird family Musophagidae ( &quot;banana-eaters&quot;), which includes &quot;plantain-eaters&quot; and &quot;go-away-birds&quot;. In southern Africa both turacos and go-away-birds are commonly known as loeries. They are semi-zygodactylous: the fourth (outer) toe can be switched back and forth. The second and third toes, which always point forward, are conjoined in some species. Musophagids often have prominent crests and long tails; the turacos are noted for peculiar and unique pigments giving them their bright green and red feathers.

Traditionally, this group has been allied with the cuckoos in the order Cuculiformes, but the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy raises this group to a full order Musophagiformes. They have been proposed to link the hoatzin to the other living birds, but this was later disputed. Recent genetic analyses have strongly supported the order ranking of Musophagiformes.

Musophagidae is one of very few bird families endemic to Africa, one other being the mousebirds, Colliidae. All species are frugivorous, but they also eat leaves, buds, and flowers. Figs are an important part of their diet. They have rounded wings and long tails and strong legs, making them poor fliers, but good runners.

Turacos are medium-sized arboreal birds endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, where they live in forests, woodland and savanna. Turacos can occasionally be found outside of their native range as escapes from captivity.

They are gregarious, non-migratory birds which move in family groups of up to 10. Many species are noisy, with the go-away-birds being especially noted for their piercing alarm calls, which alert other fauna to the presence of predators; their common name is onomatopoeia of this. Musophagids build large stick nests in trees, and lay 2 or 3 eggs. The young are born with thick down and open, or nearly-open, eyes.

==Morphology==

Most turacos are medium-sized birds – an exception being the large great blue turaco – with long tails and short, rounded wings. They range in length from . Their flight is weak, but they are strong climbers and are able to move nimbly on branches and through vegetation. Juveniles have claws on the wings that help them climb. They have a unique foot arrangement, where the fourth toe can be brought around to the back of the foot where it almost touches the first toe, or brought around so that it is near the second and third. In spite of this flexibility the toe is actually usually held at right angles to the axis of the foot.

The plumage of go-away-birds and plantain-eaters is mainly grey and white. The turacos on the other hand are brightly coloured birds, usually blue, green or purple. The green colour in turacos comes from turacoverdin, the only true green pigment in birds known to date. Other &quot;greens&quot; in bird colors result from a yellow pigment such as some carotenoid, combined with the prismatic physical structure of the feather itself which scatters the light in a particular way and giving a blue colour.

Turaco wings contain the red pigment turacin, unlike in other birds where red colour is due to carotenoids. Both pigments are derived from porphyrins and only known from the Musophagidae into the 21st century, but especially the little-researched turacoverdin might have relatives in other birds. The incidence of turacoverdin in relation to habitat is of interest to scientists, being present in forest species but absent in savanna- and acacia-living species.

Little is known about the longevity of wild turacos, but in captivity they are proving to be exceptionally long-lived, easily living to 30 years in captivity. A bird in the Cotswold Wildlife Park collection in England approached its 37th year.

==Evolution and systematics==
The fossil genus &quot;Veflintornis&quot; is known from the Middle Miocene of Grive-Saint-Alban (France). It was established as &quot;Apopempsis&quot; by Pierce Brodkorb in 1971, but this is pre-empted by Schenkling&#x27;s 1903 use of the name for some beetles. &quot;&quot;Apopempsis&quot; africanus&quot; (Early Miocene of Kenya) might also belong there.

Further fossil material of putative musophagids was found in Egypt as well as in Late Oligocene deposits at Gaimersheim in Germany and Middle Miocene deposits at Grive-Saint-Alban and Vieux-Collonges (each in France). While it is not entirely certain that these fossils are indeed of turacos, it nonetheless appears as if the family evolved in the Oligocene of central Europe or perhaps northern Africa, and later on shifted its distribution southwards. The climate of those European regions during the late Paleogene was not too dissimilar to that of (sub)tropical Africa today; the Saharan desert was not yet present and the distance across the Mediterranean was not much more than what it is today. Thus such a move south may well have been a very slow and gradual shifting of a large and continuous range.
The Early Eocene &quot;Promusophaga&quot; was initially believed to be the oldest record of the turacos; it was eventually reconsidered a distant relative of the ostrich and is now in the ratite family Lithornithidae. &quot;Filholornis&quot; from the Late Eocene or Early Oligocene of France is occasionally considered a musophagid, but its relationships have always been disputed. It is not often considered a turaco in more recent times and has been synonymised with the presumed gruiform &quot;Talantatos&quot;, though it is not certain whether this will become widely accepted.

The phylogenetic analysis conducted by Field &amp; Hsiang (2018) indicated that Eocene (Wasatchian) species &quot;Foro panarium&quot; known from the Fossil Butte Member of the Green River Formation (Wyoming, United States) was a stem-turaco.

===Phylogeny===

The IOC World Bird List (version 10.1) recognises 23 species of turaco in six genera. However, a phylogenetic analysis by Perktaş et al (2020) found genus &quot;Tauraco&quot; polyphyletic and a revised classification has been proposed based on molecular, morphological and biogeographic analysis. This study recognised 33 species-level taxa in seven genera corresponding to the major clades. The following phylogenetic tree is based on this proposal and uses their proposed genus and species names; and has been largely accepted by more recent versions of the IOC World Bird List, except that &quot;Proturacus&quot; is retained within &quot;Tauraco&quot;.

==Interaction with humans==
The crimson flight feathers of turacos have been treasured as status symbols to royalty and paramount chiefs all over Africa. They are recorded as being valued by the Swazi and Zulu royal families. British ornithologist Constantine Walter Benson, who collected heavily in Africa, is alleged to have tasted every species he collected; he claimed that turacos tasted the best.

<doc id="211325" wikidata="Q1047230" url="?curid=211325" title="Casey Kasem">
<text>Kemal Amin &quot;Casey&quot; Kasem (April 27, 1932 – June 15, 2014) was an American disc jockey, actor and radio presenter, who created and hosted several radio countdown programs, notably &quot;American Top 40&quot;. He was the first actor to voice Shaggy Rogers in the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; franchise (1969 to 1997 and 2002 to 2009) and Dick Grayson/Robin in &quot;Super Friends&quot; (1973–1985).

Kasem began hosting the original &quot;American Top 40&quot; on the weekend of July 4, 1970, and remained there until 1988. He would then spend nine years hosting another countdown titled &quot;Casey&#x27;s Top 40&quot;, beginning in January 1989 and ending in February 1998, before returning to revive &quot;American Top 40&quot; in 1998. Along the way, spin-offs of the original countdown were conceived for country music and adult contemporary audiences, and Kasem hosted two countdowns for the latter format beginning in 1992 and continuing until 2009. He also founded the &quot;American Video Awards&quot; in 1983 and continued to co-produce and host it until its final show in 1987.

Kasem also provided many commercial voiceovers, performed many voices for children&#x27;s television (such as &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and the &quot;Transformers&quot; cartoon series), was &quot;the voice of NBC&quot; and helped with the annual Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon.

==Early life==
Kemal Amin Kasem was born in Detroit, Michigan on April 27, 1932, to Lebanese Druze immigrants, Helen and Amin Kasem, who were grocers. He was named after Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, a man Kasem said his father respected. Kasem&#x27;s parents did not allow their children to speak Arabic and insisted they assimilate into American life.

In the 1940s, the radio show &quot;Make Believe Ballroom&quot; reportedly inspired Kasem to pursue a career as a radio disk jockey. Kasem received his first experience in radio covering sports at Northwestern High School in Detroit. He then attended Wayne State University, where he voiced children on radio programs such as &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; and &quot;Challenge of the Yukon.&quot; In 1952, Kasem was drafted into the U.S. Army and sent to Korea. There, he worked as a DJ/announcer on the Armed Forces Radio affiliate on the peninsula, the American Forces Korea Network (AFKN).

==Career==

===Early career===
After the war, Kasem began his professional broadcasting career in Flint, Michigan, then worked at Detroit&#x27;s WJLB and WJBK—and portrayed children&#x27;s television host &quot;Krogo the Clown&quot;—but left broadcasting to help tend to the family grocery store in Fenton, Michigan. Kasem unsuccessfully attempted work as a stage actor in New York City for six months, auditioning for a role in the off-Broadway production &quot;Ivan Of&quot;, but lost out to Ed Asner. Returning to Detroit, Kasem re-applied at WJBK but was promptly referred to co-owned WJW, which not only had a late-evening slot open but a hosting role for &quot;Cleveland Bandstand&quot; over WJW-TV as well. Cleveland&#x27;s emerging status as a popular music epicenter appealed to Kasem, having been aware of WERE&#x27;s Bill Randle dating back to when Randle worked in Detroit. Kasem identified himself as &quot;Casey at the Mike&quot; owing to varied misspellings of his name in both contemporary news accounts and station promos.

Kasem&#x27;s tenure in Cleveland was a brief but successful one, entering the market &quot;with a vengeance&quot; against Top 40 stations WHK and KYW. Within three months, Kasem reached second place behind WHK in ratings surveys on weeknights and number one on Saturday nights. Kasem&#x27;s predecessor in the time slot, Pete &quot;Mad Daddy&quot; Myers, partially inspired Kasem&#x27;s presentation on-air, but Kasem felt compelled to develop a unique on-air persona to distinguish himself. The first three hours of his evening show remained devoted to R&amp;B recordings in a &quot;high-energy rock&quot; style, while the fourth hour was more laidback with his news reader as a co-host. The R&amp;B selections and &quot;wild-tracking&quot; by Kasem also distinguished himself from WJW&#x27;s daytime pop-oriented fare, which typically featured Perry Como and The McGuire Sisters as core artists.

Nightly features included Kasem labeling songs as &quot;...of the night&quot;, with random phrases or names as a descriptor. The payola scandal which enveloped Alan Freed&#x27;s career emerged after Kasem joined WJW; in response, Kasem began a regular comedy bit called the &quot;Payola Tune of the Night&quot; which WJW management encouraged under the assumption it would dissuade listeners from thinking he was under investigation as well. Ultimately, Kasem&#x27;s career was not negatively impacted by the payola scandal. One notable stunt involved Kasem and Diana Trask engaging in an 85-second-long kiss for a &quot;world record&quot; distinction on September 14, 1959, with his news reader describing the kiss on-air. While hosting &quot;Cleveland Bandstand&quot;, Kasem started to take pep pills to lose weight; one day he forgot them while &quot;en route&quot; to the station, with the resulting pang of conscience after retrieving them from his apartment prompting him to give up the habit entirely.

After WJW switched formats to beautiful music, which Kasem attributed directly to the payola scandal, he left WJW for Buffalo&#x27;s WBNY but remained in contact with friends in the Cleveland area. At KYA in San Francisco, the general manager suggested he tone down his delivery and talk about the records instead. At KEWB in Oakland, California, Kasem was both the music director and an on-air personality. He said he was inspired by a &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Pop Music, 1962&quot; magazine he found in the trash. He created a show that mixed biographical tidbits about the artists he played, and attracted the attention of Bill Gavin, who tried to recruit him as a partner. After Kasem joined KRLA in Los Angeles in 1963, his career began to blossom and he championed the R&amp;B music of East L.A.

Kasem acted in a number of low-budget movies and radio dramas. While hosting &quot;dance hops&quot; on local television, he attracted the attention of Dick Clark, who hired him as co-host of a daily teenage music show called &quot;Shebang&quot;, starting in 1964. Kasem&#x27;s roles on network TV series included &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; and &quot;Ironside&quot;. In 1967, he appeared on &quot;The Dating Game&quot;, and played the role of &quot;Mouth&quot; in the motorcycle gang film &quot;The Glory Stompers&quot;. In 1969, he played the role of Knife in the film &quot;Wild Wheels&quot;, and had a small role in another biker movie, &quot;The Cycle Savages,&quot; starring Bruce Dern and Melody Patterson, and &quot;The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant&quot; (also with Dern).

Kasem&#x27;s voice was the key to his career. In 1964 during the Beatlemania craze, Kasem had a minor hit single called &quot;Letter from Elaina&quot;, a spoken-word recording that told the story of a girl who met George Harrison after a San Francisco Beatles concert. At the end of the 1960s, he began working as a voice actor. In 1969, he started one of his most famous roles, the voice of Shaggy on &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;. He also voiced the drummer Groove from &quot;The Cattanooga Cats&quot; that year.

===1970–1988: Acting/voiceover work and &quot;American Top 40&quot;===
On July 4, 1970, Kasem, along with Don Bustany, Tom Rounds, and Ron Jacobs, launched the weekly radio program &quot;American Top 40&quot; (&quot;AT40&quot;). At the time, top 40 radio was on the decline as DJs preferred to play album-oriented progressive rock. Loosely based on the TV program &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;, the show counted down from No. 40 to No. 1 based on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 weekly chart. Kasem mixed in biographical information and trivia about the artists, as well as flashbacks and &quot;Long-Distance Dedication&quot; segments in which he read letters from listeners wishing to dedicate songs to distant loved ones. Frequently, he mentioned a trivia fact about an unnamed singer before a commercial break, then provided the name of the singer after returning from the break. Kasem ended the program with his signature sign-off, &quot;Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars.&quot;

The show debuted on seven stations but soon went nationwide. In October 1978, the show expanded from three hours to four. &quot;American Top 40&quot; success spawned several imitators, including a weekly half-hour music video television show, &quot;America&#x27;s Top 10&quot;, hosted by Kasem himself. &quot;When we first went on the air, I thought we would be around for at least 20 years,&quot; he later remarked. &quot;I knew the formula worked. I knew people tuned in to find out what the number 1 record was.&quot; Because of his great knowledge of music, Kasem became known for his commentaries on music history that he interspersed with trivia about the artists.

In 1971, Kasem provided the character voice of Peter Cottontail in the Rankin/Bass production of &quot;Here Comes Peter Cottontail&quot;. In the same year, he appeared in &quot;The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant&quot;, in what is probably his best-remembered acting role. From 1973 to 1985, Kasem voiced Robin for several &quot;Super Friends&quot; franchise shows. In 1980, he voiced Merry in &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. He also voiced Alexander Cabot III on &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; and &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot;, and supplied a number of voices for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

In the late 1970s, Kasem portrayed an actor who imitated &quot;Columbo&quot; in the &quot;Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot; two-part episode &quot;The Mystery of the Hollywood Phantom.&quot; He portrayed a golf commentator in an episode of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; titled &quot;Winning is for Losers&quot;, and appeared on &quot;Police Story&quot;, &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; and &quot;Switch&quot;. In 1977, Kasem was hired as the narrator for the ABC sitcom &quot;Soap&quot;, but quit after the pilot episode because of the show&#x27;s controversial content. Rod Roddy took his place on the program. For a period from the late 1970s to the early 1980s, he was the staff announcer for the NBC television network. In 1984, Kasem made a cameo in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, reprising his role as the host of &quot;American Top 40&quot;.

In 1983 Kasem helped found the &quot;American Video Awards&quot;, an annual music video awards show taped for distribution for television, which he also hosted and co-produced. His goal was to make it the &quot;Oscars&quot; of music videos. There were only five award shows. The final show aired in 1987.

===1988–1998: &quot;Casey&#x27;s Top 40&quot;===
In 1988, Kasem left &quot;American Top 40&quot; because of a contract dispute with ABC Radio Network. He signed a five-year, $15 million contract with Westwood One and started &quot;Casey&#x27;s Top 40&quot;, which used a different chart, the Radio &amp; Records Contemporary (CHR)/Pop radio airplay chart (also employed contemporaneously by &quot;Rick Dees Weekly Top 40&quot;). He also hosted two shorter versions of the show, &quot;Casey&#x27;s Hot 20&quot; and &quot;Casey&#x27;s Countdown.&quot; During the late 1990s, Kasem hosted the Radio Hall of Fame induction ceremony.

Kasem voiced Mark in &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; and several &quot;Transformers&quot; characters: Bluestreak, Cliffjumper, Teletraan I and Dr. Arkeville. He left &quot;Transformers&quot; during the third season because he believed the show contained offensive caricatures of Arabs and Arab countries. In a 1990 article, he explained:
From 1989 to 1998, Kasem hosted Nick at Nite&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve countdown of the top reruns of the year. He also made cameo appearances on &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; and &quot;ALF&quot; in the 1990s. In 1997, after having voiced Shaggy Rogers on an episode of &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, Kasem quit his role in a dispute over a Burger King commercial, with Billy West and Scott Innes taking over the character in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

===1998–2009: &quot;American Top 40&quot; second run===
The original &quot;American Top 40&quot;, hosted by Shadoe Stevens after Kasem&#x27;s departure, was cancelled in 1995. Kasem regained the rights to the name in 1997, and the show was back on the air in 1998, on the AMFM Network (later acquired by Premiere Radio Networks).

At the end of 2003, Kasem announced he would leave &quot;AT40&quot; once his contract expired and would be replaced by Ryan Seacrest. He agreed to a new contract to continue hosting his weekly adult contemporary countdown shows in the interim, which at the time were both titled &quot;American Top 20&quot;. In 2005 Kasem renewed his deal with Premiere Radio Networks to continue hosting his shows, one of which had been reduced to ten songs and was retitled &quot;American Top 10&quot; to reflect the change.

In April 2005, a television special called &quot;American Top 40 Live&quot; aired on the Fox network, hosted by Seacrest, with Kasem appearing on the show. In 2008, Kasem did the voice-over for WGN America&#x27;s &quot;Out of Sight Retro Night&quot;. He was also the host of the short-lived American version of &quot;100%&quot; during the 1998–99 season.

In June 2009, Premiere announced it would no longer produce Kasem&#x27;s two remaining countdowns, ending their eleven-year relationship. Kasem, by this point at age 77, decided against finding another syndicator or replacement host, citing a desire to explore other avenues such as writing a memoir. He sent a press release announcing he would retire from radio on the July 4 weekend, the 39th anniversary of the first countdown show.

Kasem also performed TV commercial voice-overs throughout his career, appearing in more than 100 commercials.

In 2002, Kasem returned to the role of Shaggy, agreeing to continue on the condition that his character returned to vegetarianism (based on his personal lifestyle). In 2009, he retired from voice acting, with his final performance being the voice of Shaggy in &quot;Scooby-Doo! and the Samurai Sword&quot;. He did voice Shaggy again for &quot;The Official BBC Children in Need Medley&quot;, but went uncredited by his request. Although officially retired from acting, Kasem provided the voice of Colton Rogers, Shaggy&#x27;s father, on a recurring basis for the 2010–2013 series &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot;, once again uncredited at his request.

As for Kasem&#x27;s distinctive voice quality, &quot;It&#x27;s a natural quality of huskiness in the midrange of my voice that I call &#x27;garbage,&#x27;&quot; he stated to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s not a clear-toned announcer&#x27;s voice. It&#x27;s more like the voice of the guy next door.&quot;

==Personal life==
Kasem was a dedicated vegan, supported animal rights and environmental causes, and was a critic of factory farming. He initially quit voicing Shaggy in the mid to late 1990s when asked to voice Shaggy in a Burger King commercial, but returned in 2002 after negotiating to have Shaggy become a vegetarian once again.

Kasem was active in politics, supporting Lebanese-American and Arab-American causes, an interest triggered by the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. He wrote a brochure, &quot;Arab-Americans: Making a Difference&quot;, published by the Arab American Institute. He called for a more fair depiction of heroes and villains on behalf of all cultures in Disney&#x27;s 1994 sequel to &quot;Aladdin&quot; called &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot;. In 1996, he was honored as &quot;Man of the Year&quot; by the American Druze Society. Kasem campaigned against the Gulf War, advocating non-military means of pressuring Saddam Hussein into withdrawing from Kuwait, was an advocate of Palestinian independence, and arranged conflict-resolution workshops for Arab Americans and Jewish Americans.

A political liberal, Kasem narrated a campaign ad for George McGovern&#x27;s 1972 presidential campaign, hosted fundraisers for Jesse Jackson&#x27;s presidential campaigns in 1984 and 1988, supported Ralph Nader for US president in 2000, and supported progressive Democrat Dennis Kucinich in his 2004 and 2008 presidential campaigns. Kasem supported a number of other progressive causes, including affordable housing and the rights of the homeless.

Kasem was married to Linda Myers from 1972 to 1979. They had three children: Mike, Julie and Kerri Kasem.
Kasem was married to actress Jean Thompson from 1980 until his death in 2014. They had one child, Liberty Jean Kasem.

In 1989, Kasem purchased a home built in 1954 and located at 138 North Mapleton Drive in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, previously owned by developer Abraham M. Lurie, as a birthday present for his wife, Jean. In 2013, Kasem and his wife put the home on the market for US$43 million. After the dueling lawsuits between Kasem family members were settled, the property was re-listed in 2021 for US$37.9 million.

==Illness and death==
In October 2013, Kerri Kasem announced her father had Parkinson&#x27;s disease, diagnosed in 2007. However, a few months later, she said he had Lewy body dementia, which is hard to differentiate from Parkinson&#x27;s. His condition left him unable to speak during his final months.

As Kasem&#x27;s health worsened in 2013, his wife Jean prevented any contact with him, particularly by his children from his first marriage. On October 1, 2013, the children protested in front of the Kasem home. Some of Kasem&#x27;s friends and colleagues, and his brother Mouner, joined the protest. The older Kasem children sought conservatorship over their father&#x27;s care. The court denied their petition in November.

Jean removed Kasem from his Santa Monica, California, nursing home on May 7, 2014. On May 12, 2014, Kerri Kasem was granted temporary conservatorship over her father, despite her stepmother&#x27;s objection. The court ordered an investigation into Casey Kasem&#x27;s whereabouts after his wife&#x27;s attorney told the court that Casey was &quot;no longer in the United States&quot;. He was found soon afterward in Washington state.

On June 6, 2014, Kasem was reported to be in critical but stable condition in hospital in Washington state, receiving antibiotics for bedsores and treatment for high blood pressure. It was revealed he had been bedridden for some time. A judge ordered separate visitation times for Kasem&#x27;s wife and his children from his first marriage. Judge Daniel S. Murphy ruled that Kasem had to be hydrated, fed, and medicated, as a court-appointed lawyer reported on his health status. Jean Kasem claimed he had been given no food, water, or medication the previous weekend. Kerri Kasem&#x27;s lawyer stated that she had him removed from artificial food and water on the orders of a doctor, and in accordance with a directive her father signed in 2007 saying he would not want to be kept alive if it &quot;would result in a mere biological existence, devoid of cognitive function, with no reasonable hope for normal functioning.&quot; Murphy reversed his order the following Monday after it became known that Kasem&#x27;s body was no longer responding to the artificial nutrition, allowing the family to place Kasem on &quot;end-of-life&quot; measures over the objections of Jean Kasem.

On June 15, 2014, Kasem died at St. Anthony&#x27;s Hospital in Gig Harbor, Washington, at the age of 82. The immediate cause of death was reported as sepsis caused by an ulcerated bedsore. His body was handed over to his widow. Reportedly, Kasem wanted to be buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.

By July 19, 2014, a judge had granted Kerri Kasem a temporary restraining order to prevent Jean Kasem from cremating the body in order to allow an autopsy to be performed. However, when Kerri Kasem went to give a copy of the order to the funeral home, she was informed that the body had been moved at the direction of Jean Kasem. Kasem&#x27;s wife had the body moved to a funeral home in Montreal on July 14, 2014. On August 14, it was reported in the Norwegian newspaper &quot;Verdens Gang&quot; that Kasem was going to be buried in Oslo.

Jean Kasem had him interred at Oslo Western Civil Cemetery on December 16, 2014, more than six months after his death.

In November 2015, three of Kasem&#x27;s children and his brother sued his widow for wrongful death. The lawsuit charged Jean Kasem with elder abuse and inflicting emotional distress on the children by restricting access before his death. A 2018 police investigation initiated by a private investigator working for Jean found that he had received appropriate medical care while in Washington, and that there was no evidence pointing to homicide. The suits were settled in 2019.

==Honors==

In 1981, Kasem was granted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame radio division in 1985, and the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1992. Five years later, he received the Radio Hall of Fame&#x27;s first Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2003, Kasem was given the Radio Icon award at the Radio Music Awards.

<text>The Patriarchal Cathedral Basilica of Saint Mark (), commonly known as St Mark&#x27;s Basilica (; ), is the cathedral church of the Patriarchate of Venice; it became the episcopal seat of the Patriarch of Venice in 1807, replacing the earlier cathedral of San Pietro di Castello. It is dedicated to and holds the relics of Saint Mark the Evangelist, the patron saint of the city.

The church is located on the eastern end of Saint Mark&#x27;s Square, the former political and religious centre of the Republic of Venice, and is attached to the Doge&#x27;s Palace. Prior to the fall of the republic in 1797, it was the chapel of the Doge and was subject to his jurisdiction, with the concurrence of the procurators of Saint Mark for administrative and financial affairs.

The present structure is the third church, begun probably in 1063 to express Venice&#x27;s growing civic consciousness and pride. Like the two earlier churches, its model was the sixth-century Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, although accommodations were made to adapt the design to the limitations of the physical site and to meet the specific needs of Venetian state ceremonies. Middle-Byzantine, Romanesque, and Islamic influences are also evident, and Gothic elements were later incorporated. To convey the republic&#x27;s wealth and power, the original brick façades and interior walls were embellished over time with precious stones and rare marbles, primarily in the thirteenth century. Many of the columns, reliefs, and sculptures were spoils stripped from the churches, palaces, and public monuments of Constantinople as a result of the Venetian participation in the Fourth Crusade. Among the plundered artefacts brought back to Venice were the four ancient bronze horses that were placed prominently over the entry.

The interior of the domes, the vaults, and the upper walls were slowly covered with gold-ground mosaics depicting saints, prophets, and biblical scenes. Many of these mosaics were later retouched or remade as artistic tastes changed and damaged mosaics had to be replaced, such that the mosaics represent eight hundred years of artistic styles. Some of them derive from traditional Byzantine representations and are masterworks of Medieval art; others are based on preparatory drawings made by prominent Renaissance artists from Venice and Florence, including Paolo Veronese, Tintoretto, Titian, Paolo Uccello, and Andrea del Castagno.
==History==

===Participazio church (–976)===

Several medieval chronicles narrate the , the removal of Saint Mark&#x27;s body from Alexandria in Egypt by two Venetian merchants and its transfer to Venice in 828/829. The Chronicon Venetum further recounts that the relics of Saint Mark were initially placed in a corner tower of the &quot;castrum&quot;, the fortified residence of the Doge and seat of government located on the site of the present Doge&#x27;s Palace. Doge Giustiniano Participazio () subsequently stipulated in his will that his widow and his younger brother and successor Giovanni () were to erect a church dedicated to Saint Mark wherein the relics would ultimately be housed. Giustiniano further specified that the new church was to be built between the &quot;castrum&quot; and the Church of Saint Theodore to the north. Construction of the new church may have actually been underway during Doge Giustiniano&#x27;s lifetime and was completed by 836 when the relics of Saint Mark were transferred.

Although the Participazio church was long believed to have been a rectangular structure with a single apse, soundings and excavations have demonstrated that St Mark&#x27;s was from the beginning a cruciform church with at least a central dome, likely in wood. It has not been unequivocally established if each of the four crossarms of the church had a similar dome or were instead covered with gabled wooden roofs.

The prototype was the Church of the Holy Apostles (demolished 1461) in Constantinople. This radical break with the local architectural tradition of a rectangular plan in favour of a centrally planned Byzantine model reflected the growing commercial presence of Venetian merchants in the imperial capital as well as Venice&#x27;s political ties with Byzantium. More importantly, it underscored that St Mark&#x27;s was intended not as an ecclesiastical seat but as a state sanctuary.

Remnants of the Participazio church likely survive and are generally believed to include the foundations and lower parts of several of the principal walls, including the western wall between the nave and the narthex. The great entry portal may also date to the early church as well as the western portion of the crypt, under the central dome, which seems to have served as the base for a raised dais upon which the original altar was located.

===Orseolo church (976–)===
The Participazio church was severely damaged in 976 during the popular uprising against Doge Pietro IV Candiano () when the fire that angry crowds had set to drive the Doge from the &quot;castrum&quot; spread to the adjoining church. Although the structure was not completely destroyed, it was compromised to the point that the Concio, the general assembly, had to alternatively convene in the cathedral of San Pietro di Castello to elect Candiano&#x27;s successor, Pietro I Orseolo (). Within two years, the church was repaired and at the sole expense of the Orseolo family, indications that the actual damage was relatively limited. Most likely, the wooden components had been consumed, but the walls and supports remained largely intact.

Nothing certain is known of the appearance of the Orseolo church. But given the short duration of the reconstruction, it is probable that work was limited to repairing damage with little innovation. It was at this time, however, that the tomb of Saint Mark, located in the main apse, was surmounted with brick vaults, creating the semi-enclosed shrine that would later be incorporated into the crypt when the floor of the chancel was raised during the construction of the third church.

===Contarini church (–present)===
====Construction====
Civic pride led many Italian cities in the mid-eleventh century to begin erecting or rebuilding their cathedrals on a grand scale. Venice was similarly interested in demonstrating its growing commercial wealth and power, and probably in 1063, under Doge Domenico I Contarini (), St Mark&#x27;s was substantially rebuilt and enlarged to the extent that the resulting structure appeared entirely new.
The northern transept was lengthened, likely by incorporating the southern lateral nave of the Church of Saint Theodore. Similarly, the southern transept was extended, perhaps by integrating a corner tower of the &quot;castrum&quot;. Most significantly, the wooden domes were rebuilt in brick. This required strengthening the walls and piers in order to support the new heavy barrel vaults, which in turn were reinforced by arcades along the sides of the northern, southern, and western crossarms. The vaults of the eastern crossarm were supported by inserting single arches that also served to divide the chancel from the choir chapels in the lateral apses.

In front of the western façade, a narthex was built. To accommodate the height of the existing great entry, the vaulting system of the new narthex had to be interrupted in correspondence to the portal, thus creating the shaft above that was later opened to the interior of the church. The crypt was also enlarged to the east, and the high altar was moved from under the central dome to the chancel, which was raised, supported by a network of columns and vaults in the underlying crypt. By 1071, work had progressed far enough that the investiture of Doge Domenico Selvo () could take place in the unfinished church.

Work on the interior began under Selvo, who collected fine marbles and stones for the embellishment of the church and personally financed the mosaic decoration, hiring a master mosaicist from Constantinople. The Pala d&#x27;Oro (golden altarpiece), ordered from Constantinople in 1102, was installed on the high altar in 1105. For the consecration under Doge Vitale Falier Dodoni (), various dates are recorded, most likely reflecting a series of consecrations of different sections. The consecration on 8 October 1094 is considered to be the dedication of the church. On that day, the relics of Saint Mark were also placed into the new crypt.

====Embellishment====

As built, the Contarini church was a severe brick structure. Adornment inside was limited to the columns of the arcades, the balusters and parapets of the galleries, and the lattice altar screens. The wall surfaces were decorated with moulded arches that alternated with engaged brickwork columns as well as niches and a few cornices. With the exception of the outside of the apse and the western façade that faced Saint Mark&#x27;s Square, the stark brick exterior was enlivened only by receding concentric arches in contrasting brick around the windows.

The western façade, comparable to middle-Byzantine churches erected in the tenth and eleventh centuries, was characterized by a series of arches set between protruding pillars. The walls were pierced by windows set in larger blind arches, while the intervening pillars were adorned with niches and circular &quot;patere&quot; made of rare marbles and stones that were surrounded with ornamental frames. Other decorative details, including friezes and corbel tables, reflected Romanesque trends, an indication of the taste and craftsmanship of the Italian workers.

With few exceptions, most notably the juncture of the southern and western crossarms, both the exterior and interior of the church were subsequently sheathed with of marble and precious stones and enriched with columns, reliefs, and sculptures. Many of these ornamental elements were spolia taken from ancient or Byzantine buildings. Particularly in the period of the Latin Empire (1204–1261), following the Fourth Crusade, the Venetians pillaged the churches, palaces, and public monuments of Constantinople and stripped them of polychrome columns and stones. Once in Venice, some of the columns were sliced for revetmets and &quot;patere&quot;; others were paired and spread across the façades or used as altars. Despoliation continued in later centuries, notably during the Venetian–Genoese Wars. Venetian sculptors also integrated the spoils with local productions, copying the Byzantine capitals and friezes so effectively that some of their work can only be distinguished with difficulty from the originals.

====Later modifications====
In addition to the sixteen windows in each of the five domes, the church was originally lit by three or seven windows in the apse and probably eight in each of the lunettes. But many of these windows were later walled up to create more surface space for the mosaic decoration, with the result that the interior received insufficient sunlight, particularly the areas under the galleries which remained in relative darkness. The galleries were consequently reduced to narrow walkways with the exception of the ends of the northern, southern, and western crossarms where they remain. These walkways maintain the original relief panels of the galleries on the side facing the central section of the church. On the opposite side, new balustrades were erected.

The narthex of the Contarini church was originally limited to the western side. As with other Byzantine churches, it extended laterally beyond the façade on both sides and terminated in niches, of which the northern remains. The southern terminus was separated by a wall in the early twelfth century, thus creating an entry hall that opened on the southern façade toward the Doge&#x27;s Palace and the waterfront. In the early thirteenth century, the narthex was extended along the northern and southern sides to completely surround the western crossarm.

Also, in the first half of the thirteenth century, the original low-lying brick domes, typical of Byzantine churches, were surmounted with higher, outer shells supporting bulbous lanterns with crosses. These wooden frames covered in lead provided more protection from weathering to the actual domes below and gave greater visual prominence to the church. Various Near-Eastern models have been suggested as sources of inspiration and construction techniques for the heightened domes, including the Al-Aqsa and Qubbat aṣ-Ṣakhra mosques in Jerusalem and the conical frame erected over the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the early thirteenth century.

==Architecture==
===Exterior===
The three exposed façades result from a long and complex evolution. Particularly in the thirteenth century, the exterior appearance of the church was radically altered: the patterned marble encrustation was added, and a multitude of columns and sculptural elements was applied to enrich the state church. It is probable that structural elements were also added to the façades or modified.

====Western façade====

The exterior of the basilica is divided into two registers. On the western façade, the lower register is dominated by five deeply recessed portals that alternate with large piers. The lower register was later completely covered with two tiers of precious columns, largely spoils from the Fourth Crusade.

Consistent with Byzantine traditions, the sculptural elements are largely decorative: only in the arches that frame the doorways is there a functional use of sculpture that articulates the architectural lines. In addition to the reliefs in the spandrels, the sculpture at the lower level, relatively limited, includes narrow Romanesque bands, statues, and richly carved borders of foliage mixed with figures derived from Byzantine and Islamic traditions. The eastern influence is most pronounced in the tympana over the northern-most and southern-most portals.

The iconographic programme is expressed primarily in the mosaics in the lunettes. In the lower register, those of the lateral portals narrate the , the translation of Saint Mark&#x27;s relics from Alexandria to Venice. From right to left, they show the removal of the saint&#x27;s body from Egypt, its arrival in Venice, its veneration by the Doge, and its deposition in the church. This last mosaic is the only one on the façade that survives from the thirteenth century; the others were remade in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. The general appearance of the lost compositions is recorded in Gentile Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Procession in Piazza San Marco&quot; (1496), which also documents the earlier gilding on the façade.

The upper register is enriched with an elaborate Gothic crowning, executed in the late-fourteenth/early-fifteenth centuries. The original lunettes, transformed into ogee arches, are outlined with foliage and topped with statues of four military saints over the lateral lunettes and of Saint Mark flanked by angels over the central lunette, the point of which contains the winged lion of Saint Mark holding a book with the angelic salutation of the : &quot;Peace to you Mark, my Evangelist&quot; (). The intervening aediculae with pinnacles house figures of the Four Evangelists and on the extremities, facing one another, the Virgin and the Archangel Gabriel in allusion to Venice&#x27;s legendary foundation on the 25 March 421, the feast of the Annunciation.

Culminating in the Last Judgment over the main portal, the sequence of mosaics in the lateral lunettes of the upper register present scenes of Christ&#x27;s victory over death: from left to right, the Descent from the Cross, the Harrowing of Hell, the Resurrection, and the Ascension. The central lunette was originally blind and may have been pierced by several smaller windows; the present large window was inserted after the fire of 1419 destroyed the earlier structure. The reliefs of Christ and the Four Evangelists, now inserted into the northern façade, may also survive from the original decoration of the central lunette.

The four gilded bronze horses were among the early spoils brought from Constantinople after the Fourth Crusade. They were part of a quadriga adorning the Hippodrome and are the only equestrian team to survive from classical Antiquity. In the mid-thirteenth century, they were installed prominently on the main façade of St Mark&#x27;s as symbols of Venice&#x27;s military triumph over Byzantium and of its newfound imperial status as the successor of the Byzantine Empire. Since 1974 the original four horses are preserved inside, having been substituted with copies on the balcony over the central portal.

====Northern façade====
The aediculae on the northern façade contain statues of the four original Latin Doctors of the Church: Jerome, Augustine, Ambrose, and Gregory the Great. Allegorical figures of Prudence, Temperance, Faith, and Charity top the lunettes.

====Southern façade====
The Gothic crowning continues in the upper register of the southern façade, the lunettes being topped with the allegorical figures of Justice and Fortitude and the aediculae housing statues of Saint Anthony Abbot and Saint Paul the Hermit.

The southern façade is the most richly encrusted façade with rare marbles, spoils, and trophies, including the so-called pillars of Acre, the statue of the four tetrarchs embedded into the external wall of the treasury, and the porphyry imperial head on the south-west corner of the balcony, traditionally believed to represent Justinian II and popularly identified as Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola.

After a section of the narthex was partitioned off between 1100 and 1150 to create an entry hall, the niche that had previously marked the southern end of the narthex was removed, and the corresponding arch on the southern façade was opened to establish a second entry. Like the entry on the western façade, the passage was distinguished with precious porphyry columns. On either side, couchant lions and griffins were placed. Presumably, the southern entry was also flanked by the two carved pillars long believed to have been brought to Venice from the Genoese quarter in St Jean d&#x27;Acre as booty of the first Venetian–Genoese war (1256–1270) but actually spoils of the Fourth Crusade, taken from the Church of St Polyeuctus in Constantinople.
Between 1503 and 1515, the entry hall was transformed into the funerary chapel of Giovanni Battista Cardinal Zen, bishop of Vicenza, who had bequeathed a large portion of his wealth to the Venetian Republic, asking to be entombed in St Mark&#x27;s. The southern entrance was consequently closed, blocked by the altar and a window above, and although the griffins remain, much of the decoration was transferred or destroyed. The pillars were moved slightly eastward.

===Entry hall (Zen Chapel)===
The decoration of the southern entry hall to the church was redone in the thirteenth century in conjunction with work in the adjoining narthex; of the original appearance of the entry hall, nothing is known. The present mosaic cycle in the barrel vault forms the prelude to the mosaic cycle on the main façade, which narrates the translation of Saint Mark&#x27;s relics from Alexandria in Egypt to Venice. The events depicted include the , the angelic prophecy that Mark would one day be buried in Venice, which affirms Venice&#x27;s divine right to possess the relics. The authority of Saint Mark is demonstrated in the scenes that show the writing of his Gospel which is then presented to Saint Peter. Particular relevance is also given to the departure of Saint Mark for Egypt and his miracles there, which creates continuity with the opening scene on the façade, depicting the removal of the body from Alexandria.

Although largely redone in the nineteenth century, the apse above the doorway that leads into the narthex probably maintains the overall aspect of the decoration from the first half of the twelfth century with the Virgin flanked by angels, a theme common in middle-Byzantine churches.

===Interior===
Although St Mark&#x27;s was modelled after the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, ceremonial needs and limitations posed by the pre-existing walls and foundations made it necessary to adapt the design. The cruciform plan with five domes was maintained. However the Holy Apostles was a true centrally planned church: the central dome, larger than the others, was alone pierced with windows, and the altar was located underneath. There was no distinction between the four crossarms: no apse existed and double-tiered arcades surrounded the interior on all sides. In contrast, the longitudinal axis was emphasized to create a space appropriate for processions associated with state ceremonies. Both the central and western domes are larger, accentuating the progression along the nave, and by means of a series of increasingly smaller arches, the nave visually narrows towards the raised chancel in the eastern crossarm, where the altar stands. The crossarms of the transept are shorter and narrower. Optically, their height and width are further reduced by the insertion of arches, supported on double columns within the barrel vaults. The domes of the transept and the chancel are also smaller.

As with the Holy Apostles, each dome rests on four barrel vaults, those of the central dome rising from quadripartite (four-legged) piers. But the two-tiered arcades that reinforced the vaults in the Holy Apostles were modified. In St Mark&#x27;s there are no upper arcades, and as a result the aisles are less isolated from the central part of the church. The effect is of more unified sense of space and an openness that have parallels in other Byzantine churches constructed in the eleventh century, an indication that the chief architect was influenced by middle-Byzantine architectural models in addition to the sixth-century Church of the Holy Apostles.

====Chancel and choir chapels====

The chancel is enclosed by a Gothic altar screen, dated 1394. It is surmounted by a bronze and silver Crucifix, flanked by statues of the Virgin and Saint Mark, together with the Twelve Apostles. On the left of the screen is the ambo for readings from Scripture, while the on the right is the platform from which the newly elected Doge was presented to the people.

Behind, marble banisters mark the limit of the choir, which after the reorganization by Doge Andrea Gritti () was utilized by the Doge, civic leaders, and foreign ambassadors. Prior to the sixteenth century, the Doge&#x27;s throne was located near the choir chapel of Saint Clement I, whose doorway opened to the courtyard of the Doge&#x27;s Palace. The chapel was reserved for the Doge&#x27;s private use. From the window above, which communicates with his private apartments, it was also possible for the Doge to assist at mass in the church.

The tribunes on either side of the chancel are faced with bronze reliefs that portray events in the life of Saint Mark and his miracles. Beyond the banisters is the presbytery, reserved for the clergy, with the high altar which since 1835 contains the relics of Saint Mark, previously located in the crypt. The ciborium above the altar is supported by four intricately carved columns with scenes that narrate the lives of Christ and the Virgin. The age and provenance of the columns is disputed, with proposals ranging from sixth-century Byzantium to thirteenth-century Venice. The altarpiece, originally designed as an antependium, is the Pala d&#x27;Oro, a masterpiece of Byzantine enamels on gilded silver.

The two choir chapels, located on either side of the chancel, occupy the space corresponding to the lateral aisles in the other crossarms. They are connected to the chancel through archways which also serve to reinforce the barrel vaults supporting the dome above. The choir chapel on the northern side is dedicated to Saint Peter. Historically, it was the principal area for the clergy. The mosaic decoration in the vaults above the chapels largely narrates the life of Saint Mark, including the events of the . They constitute the oldest surviving representation of the transfer of Saint Mark&#x27;s relics to Venice.

====Side altars and chapels====
The side altars in the transept were used primarily by the faithful. In the northern crossarm, the altar was originally dedicated to Saint John the Evangelist: the mosaics in the dome above show the aged figure of Saint John, surrounded by five scenes of his life in Ephesus. The stone relief of Saint John, placed on the eastern wall of the crossarm in the thirteenth century, was later moved to the northern façade of the church, probably when the altar was rededicated in 1617 to the Madonna Nicopeia, a venerated Byzantine icon from the late-eleventh/early-twelfth century.

The date and the circumstances of the icon&#x27;s arrival in Venice are not documented. Most likely one of many sacred images taken from Constantinople at the time of the Latin Empire, it was deposited in St Mark&#x27;s treasury, with no specific importance associated. It began to acquire significance for the Venetians in the fourteenth century when it was framed with Byzantine enamels looted from the Pantokrator in Contantinople. At that time, it may have been first carried in public procession to invoke the Virgin&#x27;s intercession in ridding the city of the Black Death. The icon acquired a political role as the palladium of Venice in the sixteenth century when it came to be identified as the sacred image that had been carried into battle by various Byzantine emperors. In 1589, the icon was transferred to the small Chapel of Saint Isidore where it was made accessible to the public, and subsequently it was placed on the side altar in the northern crossarm. It was first referred to as the Madonna Nicopeia (&quot;Nikopoios&quot;, Bringer of Victory) in 1645.

The altar in the southern crossarm was initially dedicated to Saint Leonard, the sixth-century Frankish saint who became widely popular at the time of the Crusades as his intercession was sought to liberate prisoners from the Muslims. He is shown in the dome above, together with other saints particularly venerated in Venice: Blaise, Nicholas, and Clement I. The altar was rededicated in 1617 to the True Cross, and since 1810, it has been the Altar of the Blessed Sacrament.

The long-neglected relics of Saint Isidore of Chios, brought to Venice in 1125 by Doge Domenico Michiel () on return from his military expedition in the Aegean, were rediscovered in the mid-fourteenth century, and upon the initiative of Doge Andrea Dandolo (), the Chapel of Saint Isidore was constructed between 1348 and 1355 to house them. An annual feast (16 April) was also established in the Venetian liturgical calendar.

The Mascoli Chapel, utilized by the homonymous confraternity after 1618, was decorated under Doge Francesco Foscari () and dedicated in 1430.

Against the piers that support the central dome, on either side of the chancel, Doge Cristoforo Moro () erected at his personal expense two altars dedicated to Saint Paul and Saint James. The pier behind the Altar of Saint James is where the relics of Saint Mark are said to have been rediscovered in 1094: the miraculous event is depicted in the mosaics on the opposite side of the crossarm.

====Baptistery====
The date of construction of the baptistery is not known, but it is likely to have been under Doge Giovanni Soranzo (), whose tomb is located in the baptistery, an indication that he was responsible for the architectural adaptation. Similarly entombed in the baptistery is Doge Andrea Dandolo who carried out the decorative programme at his personal expense. The mosaics present scenes from the life of Saint John the Baptist on the walls and, in the ante-baptistery, the infancy of Christ. Directly above the bronze font, designed by Sansovino, the dome contains the dispersion of the Apostles, each shown in the act of baptizing a different nationality in reference to Christ&#x27;s command to preach the Gospel to all people. The second dome, above the altar, presents Christ in glory surrounded by the nine angelic choirs. The altar is a large granite rock, which according to tradition was brought to Venice from Tyre following the Venetian conquest. It is said to be the rock upon which Christ stood to preach to the people of Tyre.

====Sacristy====
In 1486, Giorgio Spavento, as &quot;proto&quot; (consultant architect and buildings manager), designed a new sacristy, connected to both the presbytery and the choir chapel of Saint Peter; the location of the earlier sacristy is not known. It was Spavento&#x27;s first project and the only one he oversaw to completion. Decoration began in 1493. The cabinets, used for storing reliquaries, monstrances, vestments, and liturgical objects and books, were inlaid by Antonio della Mola and his brother Paolo and show scenes from the life of Saint Mark. The mosaic decoration of the vault, depicting Old-Testament prophets, was designed by Titian and executed between 1524 and 1530.

Behind the sacristy is the church, also by Spavento, dedicated to Saint Theodore, the first patron saint of Venice. Constructed between 1486 and 1493 in an austere Renaissance style, it served as the private chapel for the canons of the basilica and, later, as the seat of the Venetian Inquisition.

===Influence===
As the state church, St Mark&#x27;s was a point of reference for Venetian architects. Its influence during the Gothic period seems to have been limited to decorative patterns and details, such as the portal and painted wall decoration in the Church of Santo Stefano and the portal of the Church of the Madonna dell&#x27;Orto, consisting of an ogee arch with flame-like relief sculpture reminiscent of the crockets on St Mark&#x27;s.

In the early Renaissance, despite the introduction of classical elements into Venetian architecture by Lombard stonecutters, faithfulness to local building traditions remained strong. In the façades of Ca&#x27; Dario and the Church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli, surface decoration in emulation of St Mark&#x27;s is the principal characteristic, and the overall effect derives from the rich encrustation of shimmering coloured marbles and the circular patterns, derived from the basilica. Similarly, the Foscari Arch in the courtyard of the Doge&#x27;s Palace is based on ancient triumphal arches but owes its detailing to the basilica: the superimposed columns clustered together, the Gothic pinnacles, and the crowning statuary. At the Scuola Grande di San Marco, the reference to St Mark&#x27;s is made in the series of lunettes along the roofline which recalls the profile of the basilica.

==Mosaics==
===Decorative programme===
====Interior====

The location of the main altar within the apse necessarily affected the decorative programme. The Christ Pantocrator, customarily located in the central dome over the altar, was placed in the semi-dome of the apse. Below, interspersed with three windows, are late-eleventh and early-twelfth-century mosaics that portray Saint Nicholas of Myra, Saint Peter, Saint Mark, and Saint Hermagoras of Aquileia as the protectors and patrons of the state, Saint Nicholas being specifically the protector of seafarers.

Over the high altar in the eastern crossarm is the Dome of Immanuel (God with us). It presents a young Christ in the centre, surrounded by stars. Radially arranged underneath are standing figures of the Virgin and Old-Testament prophets, the latter bearing scrolls with passages that largely refer to the Incarnation. Rather than seraphim as was customary in middle-Byzantine churches, the pendentives of the dome show the symbols of the Four Evangelists.

An extensive cycle narrating the Life of Christ covers much of the interior, with the principal events located along the longitudinal axis. The eastern vault, between the central dome and the chancel, contains the major events of the infancy (Annunciation, Adoration of the Magi, Presentation in the Temple) along with the Baptism of Christ and the Transfiguration. The western vault depicts the events of the Passion of Jesus on one side (the kiss of Judas, the trial before Pilate, and the Crucifixion) and the Resurrection on the other side (the Harrowing of Hell and the post-resurrection appearances). A secondary series illustrating Christ&#x27;s miracles is located in the transepts. The series seems to have derived from an eleventh-century Byzantine Gospel. The transepts also contain a detailed cycle of the Life of the Virgin: these scenes were probably derived from an eleventh-century illuminated manuscript of the Protogospel of James from Constantinople. As a prelude, a Tree of Jesse showing the ancestors of Christ was added to the end wall of the northern crossarm between 1542 and 1551. Throughout the various narrative cycles, Old-Testament prophets are portrayed holding texts that relate to the New-Testament scenes nearby.

The Dome of the Ascension occupies the central position, whereas in the Church of the Holy Apostles it was located over the southern crossarm. The dome, executed in the late twelfth century, is exemplary of middle-Byzantine prototypes in Constantinople. In the centre Christ ascends, accompanied by four angels and surrounded by standing figures of the Virgin, two angels, and the Twelve Apostles. As customary for the central dome in middle-Byzantine churches, the pendentives contain the Four Evangelists, each with his gospel.

As in the Church of the Holy Apostles, the Dome of Pentecost is located over the western crossarm. In the centre is an hetoimasia, an empty throne with a book and dove. Radiating outward are silver rays which fall on the heads of the Apostles seated around the outer rim of the dome, each with a flame on his head. In keeping with Pentecost, as the institution of the Church, the side vaults and walls of the western crossarm largely illustrate the subsequent missionary activities of the Apostles and their deaths as martyrs. The specific events in the lives of the various Apostles and the manner of their deaths adhere to Western traditions, as narrated in Latin martyrologies that derive in part from the Book of Acts but to a greater extent from apocryphal sources. However, the single representations and the overall concept of presenting the lives of the saints in a composition that combines several events together in one scene have their parallels in Greek manuscript illustrations of the middle-Byzantine period.

The western vault illustrates Saint John&#x27;s vision of the Apocalypse and the Last Judgement. On the wall below there is a thirteenth-century deesis with Christ enthroned between the Virgin and Saint Mark.

====Narthex====
The decorative programme of the western and northern wings of the narthex seems to have been planned in its entirety in the thirteenth century when the eleventh-century narthex was extended along the northern and southern sides of the western crossarm. However, a stylistic change in the mosaics is evident in the northern wing, indicating that the execution of the programme was interrupted, presumably to await the completion of the vaulting system.
Unlike in middle-Byzantine churches where the theme of the Last Judgement is often represented in the narthex, the decorative programme narrates the stories of Genesis and Exodus: the main subjects are the Creation and the Tower of Babel along with the lives of Noah, Abraham, Joseph, and Moses. Special emphasis is given to the stories of the sacrifice of Abel and the hospitality of Abraham, located prominently in the lunettes on either side of the entry to the church, due to the analogies with Christ&#x27;s death and the Eucharistic meal.

It has long been recognized that the individual scenes are very close to those of the Cotton Genesis, an important fourth or fifth-century Greek illuminated manuscript copy of the Book of Genesis: about a hundred of the 359 miniatures in the manuscript were used. Of Egyptian origin, the manuscript may have reached Venice as a result of the commercial relations of the Venetians in the Eastern Mediterranean or as booty of the Fourth Crusade. The sixth-century Vienna Genesis was also in Venice in the early thirteenth century and may have influenced artistic choices. With regard to the Dome of Moses, the scenes most closely resemble Palaeologan art, suggesting an unknown manuscript from the third quarter of the thirteenth century as the iconographic source.

While the Byzantine renderings of the Old-Testament stories in illuminated manuscripts provided suitable models, Byzantine churches themselves did not generally give importance to the Old Testament in their decoration, considering the stories to be shadows of the history of salvation, inferior to the reality of the New Testament. The impetus for the Venetians to choose the Old Testament as the theme of the narthex was instead of western derivation and reflected an interest that had developed in Rome beginning in the late eleventh century.

The narration begins in correspondence to the former southern entry of the church with the Dome of the Creation, which opens with the spirit of God hovering above the waters and concludes with Adam and Eve cast out from the Garden of Eden. As in the Cotton Genesis, Christ is portrayed as the agent of creation. Underneath, the pendentives contain cherubim, the guardians of Eden, and the lunettes illustrate the story of Cain and Abel. The stories of Noah and of the Tower of Babel with the confusion of tongues and the dispertion of the nations occupy the vaults on either side of the entry to the church. The story of Abraham, from the calling of the patriarch to the circumcision of Isaac, is narrated in a single dome and the two lunettes underneath, whereas the story of Joseph, the most extensive, occupies the next three domes. The story of Moses, until the Crossing of the Red Sea, is limited to the final bay.

===Style===

The oldest mosaics in St Mark&#x27;s, located in the niches of the entry porch in the narthex, may date to as early as 1070. Although Byzantine in style, they are somewhat antiquated with respect to contemporary trends in Byzantium. Most likely, they were executed by mosaicists who had left Constantinople in the mid-eleventh century to work on the cathedral of Torcello and then remained in the local area. More modern but still archaic in style are the figures in the main apse which were done in the late-eleventh and early-twelfth centuries.

The most important period of decoration was the twelfth century when Venice&#x27;s relations with Byzantium alternated between political tensions that limited artistic influence from the East and moments of intense trade and cooperation that favoured the Venetians&#x27; awareness of eastern prototypes as well as the influx of Byzantine mosaicists and materials. The three figures in the Dome of Immanuel that date to the first quarter of the century (Jeremiah, Hosea, and Habakkuk) are the work of highly skilled mosaicists, likely Greek-trained. They demonstrate the greater classicism and realism of middle-Byzantine painting in Constantinople but also local trends in the harsher and broken lines. In succeeding phases of work in the choir chapels and the transept, Byzantine miniatures were copied more or less faithfully for the mosaics, but any eastern influence that could reflect the latest artistic developments in Constantinople is hardly traceable. A new and direct awareness of artistic developments in Constantinople is indicated in the Dome of Pentecost, executed sometime in the first half of the twelfth century.

In the last third of the twelfth century, a large portion of the mosaics in the Dome of Immanuel and the entirety of the Dome of the Ascension and of several vaults in the western crossarm had to be completely redone in consequence of a catastrophic event, the nature and date of which are not known. Local influence is evident. But the more vigorous poses, agitated draperies, expressiveness, and heightened contrast show the partial assimilation of the developing dynamic style in Constantinople. The mosaics in the Dome of the Ascension and those depicting the Passion in the nearby vault represent the maturity of the Venetian mosaic school and are one of the great achievements of Medieval art.

After the removal of the galleries, the mosaic decoration was extended onto the lower walls, beginning in the thirteenth century. The first mosaic, depicting the Agony in the Garden, represents a synthesizing of various traditions, both eastern and western. Traces remain of the complicated patterns of the late Komnenian period. But the statuesque quality of the figures, which are also more rounded, reflect contemporary developments in Byzantine art such as can be seen at Studenica Monastery. Concurrently, an elegance associated with western Gothic appears and is fused with the Byzantine traditions. The Gothic influence becomes more pronounced in later mosaics of the period with patterned backgrounds that derive from the stained-glass windows in French churches.

The interior mosaics were apparently complete by the 1270s, with work on the narthex continuing into the 1290s. Although some activity must have still been underway in 1308 when the Great Council allowed a glass furnace on Murano to produce mosaic material for St Mark&#x27;s during the summer, by 1419 no competent mosaicist remained to repair the extensive damage to the main apse and western dome caused by a fire that year. The Venetian government had to consequently seek assistance from the Signoria of Florence which sent Paolo Uccello. Other Florentine artists, including Andrea del Castagno, were also active in St Mark&#x27;s in the mid-fifteenth century, introducing a sense of perspective largely achieved with architectural settings. In this same period, Michele Giambono executed mosaics.

By the time a new fire in 1439 made repairs once again necessary, a number of Venetian mosaicists had been trained. Some of the replacement mosaics they created show a Florentine influence; others reflect Renaissance developments in the detailing and the modelling of the figures. But overall the replacement mosaics in this period closely imitated the design of the damaged works and were intended to look medieval.
Efforts to maintain the stylistic integrity of the medieval works whenever repairs and restorations became necessary were largely abandoned in the sixteenth century. Often in the absence of any need to restore mosaics but under the sole pretense of replacing old mosaics with Renaissance and Mannerist ones, renowned artists such as Titian, Tintoretto, Paolo Veronese, Giuseppe Salviati, Palma Giovane increasingly competed for work in the church, preparing preliminary sketches for &#x27;modern&#x27; mosaics, considered artistically superior, with little attempt to stylistically integrate the new figures and scenes into the older compositions.

In addition to damage from fire and earthquake as well as from the vibrations that resulted whenever cannon were fired in salute from ships in the lagoon, the normal decay of the underlying masonry made it necessary to repeatedly repair the mosaics. In 1716, Leopoldo dal Pozzo, a mosaicist from Rome, was commissioned to assume responsibility for the repair and maintenance of the mosaics in St Mark&#x27;s, the local craftsmen having once again largely died out. Dal Pozzo also executed a few new mosaics based on preliminary drawings by Giovanni Battista Piazzetta and Sebastiano Ricci. An exclusive contract for restoration was stipulated in 1867 with the mosaic workshop run by the Salviati glassmaking firm, whose highly criticized restoration work often involved removing and resetting the mosaics, usually with a considerable loss of quality. Although the original iconographic programme has been largely preserved, despite centuries of restoration and renewal, and roughly three-fourths of the mosaics maintain their earlier compositions and styles, only about a third can be considered original.

===Floor mosaics===

The floor, executed primarily in &quot;opus sectile&quot; and to a lesser extent in &quot;opus tessellatum&quot;, dates to either the late eleventh century or first half of the twelfth century. It consists of geometric patterns and animal designs made from a wide variety of coloured limestones and marbles. The animals represented, including lions, eagles, griffons, deer, dogs, peacocks, and others, largely derive from medieval bestiaries and have symbolic meanings.

Although it has similarities with Romanesque floors, the inclusion of large slabs of marble surrounded with decorative cornices also suggests an influence from eastern prototypes. The frequent use of intertwined circles also recalls medieval Italian cosmatesque floors. 
==Administration==
Under the Venetian Republic, St Mark&#x27;s was the private chapel of the Doge. The , responsible for the religious functions, was nominated by the Doge personally, and despite several attempts by the Bishop of Olivolo/Castello (after 1451 Patriarch of Venice) to claim jurisdiction over St Mark&#x27;s, the remained subject to the Doge alone.

Beginning in the ninth century, the Doge also nominated a procurator , responsible for the financial administration of the church, its upkeep, and its decoration. By the mid-thirteenth century there were two procurators in charge of the church, denominated . Elected by the Great Council, they supervised the church , limiting the authority of the Doge. In 1442, there were three procurators who administered the church and its treasury. The procurators also hired and paid the &quot;proto&quot;, directly responsible for overseeing construction, maintenance, and restoration.

St Mark&#x27;s ceased to be the private chapel of the Doge as a result of the fall of the Republic of Venice to the French in 1797, and the was required to take an oath of office under the provisional municipal government. At that time, plans began to transfer the seat of the Patriarch of Venice from San Pietro di Castello to St Mark&#x27;s. However, no action was taken before Venice passed under Austrian control in 1798. During the first period of Austrian rule (1798–1805), it was alternatively suggested that the episcopal seat be moved to the Church of San Salvador, but again no action was taken until 1807 when, during the second period of French domination (1805–1814), St Mark&#x27;s became the patriarchal cathedral. The new status was confirmed by Emperor Francis I of Austria in 1816 during the second period of Austrian rule (1814–1866) and by Pope Pius VII in 1821.

==Music==

An expense note for repairs from 1316 indicates that St Mark&#x27;s already possessed more than one organ, presumably two located in the galleries on either side of the chancel. Over time, they were repeatedly renewed and replaced. Of the organs rebuilt in 1766 by , the &#x27;small organ&#x27; () in the southern gallery remains, whereas the &#x27;big organ&#x27; () in the northern gallery was again rebuilt in 1893, with components from Callido&#x27;s organ. A smaller third organ for concerts was located on the floor level after 1588.

Documents also record the use of other instruments for liturgical celebrations, including violins, violas, &quot;viole da braccio&quot;, &quot;violoni&quot;, theorbos, cornetts, sackbuts, bassoons, and later flutes, trumpets, and oboes. The number of instruments was fixed at thirty-four in 1685, adjusted to thirty-five in 1786. Organists, singers, and instrumentalists were selected by the procurators of Saint Mark on the basis of a rigorous examination. Many of the early instrumentalists and singers were members of the clergy, but from the mid-seventeenth century, the orphanages attached to the four state hospices supplied the best musicians. Renowned musicians were also invited to perform for special functions.

Beginning in 1491, the procurators also appointed a choirmaster () who supervised and conducted all performances. He was assisted by the &quot;vice-maestro di cappella&quot; and by the &quot;maestro di concerti&quot;, the directors of the two choirs. The &quot;maestro di coro&quot;, established in 1514, supervised the plainchant sung by the clergy.

All musicians and singers were obligated to be present whenever the Doge attended mass for solemn occasions. They were positioned in the tribunes on either side of the chancel or in the &quot;pulpitum magnum cantorum&quot;, the large raised platform in front of the altarscreen on the right. For more elaborate compositions with multiple choirs in the seventeenth century, singers and musicians could also be positioned in the upper galleries.

This division of the choir into parts and their physical separation, , was integral to the Venetian polychoral style, the development of which was favoured by the particular acoustic qualities of St Mark&#x27;s. The style was characterized by two groups, each having a self-sufficient four-part harmony without dissonance, singing alternatively or simultaneously for effect, particularly at the end of a composition. It originated in the early sixteenth century in several cities of the Venetian mainland, including Padua, Bergamo, Treviso, and was introduced into St Mark&#x27;s by Adrian Willaert who was nominated choirmaster in 1527 at the behest of Doge Andrea Gritti. The style continued to develop and was popularized throughout Europe by means of the compositions of various choirmasters, including Cipriano de Rore, Gioseffo Zarlino, Giovanni Croce, and Claudio Monteverdi, as well as organists such as Claudio Merulo, Andrea Gabrieli, and his nephew Giovanni Gabrieli. Although plainchant and &quot;falsobordone&quot; continued to be used, psalms sung with &quot;coro spezzato&quot; were common for vespers and were specifically required for all major holy days.
