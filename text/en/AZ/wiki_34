<text>The management of HIV/AIDS normally includes the use of multiple antiretroviral drugs as a strategy to control HIV infection. There are several classes of antiretroviral agents that act on different stages of the HIV life-cycle. The use of multiple drugs that act on different viral targets is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HAART decreases the patient&#x27;s total burden of HIV, maintains function of the immune system, and prevents opportunistic infections that often lead to death. HAART also prevents the transmission of HIV between serodiscordant same-sex and opposite-sex partners so long as the HIV-positive partner maintains an undetectable viral load.

Treatment has been so successful that in many parts of the world, HIV has become a chronic condition in which progression to AIDS is increasingly rare. Anthony Fauci, former head of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has written, &quot;With collective and resolute action now and a steadfast commitment for years to come, an AIDS-free generation is indeed within reach.&quot; In the same paper, he noted that an estimated 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone by antiretroviral therapy. As another commentary noted, &quot;Rather than dealing with acute and potentially life-threatening complications, clinicians are now confronted with managing a chronic disease that in the absence of a cure will persist for many decades.&quot;

The United States Department of Health and Human Services and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend offering antiretroviral treatment to all patients with HIV. Because of the complexity of selecting and following a regimen, the potential for side effects, and the importance of taking medications regularly to prevent viral resistance, such organizations emphasize the importance of involving patients in therapy choices and recommend analyzing the risks and the potential benefits.

The WHO has defined health as more than the absence of disease. For this reason, many researchers have dedicated their work to better understanding the effects of HIV-related stigma, the barriers it creates for treatment interventions, and the ways in which those barriers can be circumvented.
== Classes of medication ==
There are six classes of drugs, which are usually used in combination, to treat HIV infection. Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are broadly classified by the phase of the retrovirus life-cycle that the drug inhibits. Typical combinations include two nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) as a &quot;backbone&quot; along with one non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), protease inhibitor (PI) or integrase inhibitors (also known as integrase nuclear strand transfer inhibitors or INSTIs) as a &quot;base&quot;.

===Entry inhibitors===
Entry inhibitors (or fusion inhibitors) interfere with binding, fusion and entry of HIV-1 to the host cell by blocking one of several targets. Maraviroc, enfuvirtide and Ibalizumab are available agents in this class. Maraviroc works by targeting CCR5, a co-receptor located on human helper T-cells. Caution should be used when administering this drug, however, due to a possible shift in tropism which allows HIV to target an alternative co-receptor such as CXCR4. Ibalizumab is effective against both CCR5 and CXCR4 tropic HIV viruses.

In rare cases, individuals may have a mutation in the CCR5 delta gene which results in a nonfunctional CCR5 co-receptor and in turn, a means of resistance or slow progression of the disease. However, as mentioned previously, this can be overcome if an HIV variant that targets CXCR4 becomes dominant. To prevent fusion of the virus with the host membrane, enfuvirtide can be used. Enfuvirtide is a peptide drug that must be injected and acts by interacting with the N-terminal heptad repeat of gp41 of HIV to form an inactive hetero six-helix bundle, therefore preventing infection of host cells.

===Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors===
Nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTI) are nucleoside and nucleotide analogues which inhibit reverse transcription. HIV is an RNA virus, so it can not be integrated into the DNA in the nucleus of the human cell unless it is first &quot;reverse&quot; transcribed into DNA. Since the conversion of RNA to DNA is not naturally done in the mammalian cell, it is performed by a viral protein, reverse transcriptase, which makes it a selective target for inhibition. NRTIs are chain terminators. Once NRTIs are incorporated into the DNA chain, their lack of a 3&#x27; OH group prevents the subsequent incorporation of other nucleosides. Both NRTIs and NtRTIs act as competitive substrate inhibitors. Examples of NRTIs include zidovudine, abacavir, lamivudine, emtricitabine, and of NtRTIs – tenofovir and adefovir.

===Non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors===
Non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) inhibit reverse transcriptase by binding to an allosteric site of the enzyme; NNRTIs act as non-competitive inhibitors of reverse transcriptase. NNRTIs affect the handling of substrate (nucleotides) by reverse transcriptase by binding near the active site. NNRTIs can be further classified into 1st generation and 2nd generation NNRTIs. 1st generation NNRTIs include nevirapine and efavirenz. 2nd generation NNRTIs are etravirine and rilpivirine. HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant to NNRTIs.

===Integrase inhibitors===
Integrase inhibitors (also known as integrase nuclear strand transfer inhibitors or INSTIs) inhibit the viral enzyme integrase, which is responsible for integration of viral DNA into the DNA of the infected cell. There are several integrase inhibitors under clinical trial, and raltegravir became the first to receive FDA approval in October 2007. Raltegravir has two metal binding groups that compete for substrate with two Mg2+ ions at the metal binding site of integrase. As of early 2022, four other clinically approved integrase inhibitors are elvitegravir, dolutegravir, bictegravir, and cabotegravir.

===Protease inhibitors===
Protease inhibitors block the viral protease enzyme necessary to produce mature virions upon budding from the host membrane. Particularly, these drugs prevent the cleavage of gag and gag/pol precursor proteins. Virus particles produced in the presence of protease inhibitors are defective and mostly non-infectious. Examples of HIV protease inhibitors are lopinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir and ritonavir. Darunavir and atazanavir are recommended as first line therapy choices. Maturation inhibitors have a similar effect by binding to gag, but development of two experimental drugs in this class, bevirimat and vivecon, was halted in 2010. Resistance to some protease inhibitors is high. Second generation drugs have been developed that are effective against otherwise resistant HIV variants.

== Combination therapy ==
The life cycle of HIV can be as short as about 1.5 days from viral entry into a cell, through replication, assembly, and release of additional viruses, to infection of other cells. HIV lacks proofreading enzymes to correct errors made when it converts its RNA into DNA via reverse transcription. Its short life-cycle and high error rate cause the virus to mutate very rapidly, resulting in a high genetic variability. Most of the mutations either are inferior to the parent virus (often lacking the ability to reproduce at all) or convey no advantage, but some of them have a natural selection superiority to their parent and can enable them to slip past defenses such as the human immune system and antiretroviral drugs. The more active copies of the virus, the greater the possibility that one resistant to antiretroviral drugs will be made.

When antiretroviral drugs are used improperly, multi-drug resistant strains can become the dominant genotypes very rapidly. In the era before multiple drug classes were available (pre-1997), the reverse-transcriptase inhibitors zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, and lamivudine were used serially or in combination leading to the development of multi-drug resistant mutations.

In contrast, antiretroviral combination therapy defends against resistance by creating multiple obstacles to HIV replication. This keeps the number of viral copies low and reduces the possibility of a superior mutation. If a mutation that conveys resistance to one of the drugs arises, the other drugs continue to suppress reproduction of that mutation. With rare exceptions, no individual antiretroviral drug has been demonstrated to suppress an HIV infection for long; these agents must be taken in combinations in order to have a lasting effect. As a result, the standard of care is to use combinations of antiretroviral drugs. Combinations usually consist of three drugs from at least two different classes. This three drug combination is commonly known as a triple cocktail. Combinations of antiretrovirals are subject to positive and negative synergies, which limits the number of useful combinations.

Because of HIV&#x27;s tendency to mutate, when patients who have started an antiretrovial regimen fail to take it regularly, resistance can develop. On the other hand, patients who take their medications regularly can stay on one regimen without developing resistance. This greatly increases life expectancy and leaves more drugs available to the individual should the need arise.
In 2000 drug companies have worked together to combine these complex regimens into single-pill fixed-dose combinations. More than 20 antiretroviral fixed-dose combinations have been developed. This greatly increases the ease with which they can be taken, which in turn increases the consistency with which medication is taken (adherence), and thus their effectiveness over the long-term.

===Adjunct treatment===
Although antiretroviral therapy has helped to improve the quality of life of people living with HIV, there is still a need to explore other ways to further address the disease burden. One such potential strategy that was investigated was to add interleukin 2 as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV. A Cochrane review included 25 randomized controlled trials that were conducted across six countries. The researchers found that interleukin 2 increases the CD4 immune cells, but does not make a difference in terms of death and incidence of other infections. Furthermore, there is probably an increase in side-effects with interleukin 2. The findings of this review do not support the use of interleukin 2 as an add-on treatment to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV.

==Treatment guidelines==
=== Initiation of antiretroviral therapy ===
Antiretroviral drug treatment guidelines have changed over time. Before 1987, no antiretroviral drugs were available and treatment consisted of treating complications from opportunistic infections and malignancies. After antiretroviral medications were introduced, most clinicians agreed that HIV positive patients with low CD4 counts should be treated, but no consensus formed as to whether to treat patients with high CD4 counts.

In April 1995, Merck and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases began recruiting patients for a trial examining the effects of a three drug combination of the protease inhibitor indinavir and two nucleoside analogs, illustrating the substantial benefit of combining two NRTIs with a new class of antiretrovirals, protease inhibitors, namely indinavir. Later that year David Ho became an advocate of this &quot;hit hard, hit early&quot; approach with aggressive treatment with multiple antiretrovirals early in the course of the infection. Later reviews in the late 90s and early 2000s noted that this approach of &quot;hit hard, hit early&quot; ran significant risks of increasing side effects and development of multidrug resistance, and this approach was largely abandoned. The only consensus was on treating patients with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 counts less than 350/μL). Treatment with antiretrovirals was expensive at the time, ranging from $10,000 to $15,000 a year.

The timing of when to start therapy has continued to be a core controversy within the medical community, though recent studies have led to more clarity. The NA-ACCORD study observed patients who started antiretroviral therapy either at a CD4 count of less than 500 versus less than 350 and showed that patients who started ART at lower CD4 counts had a 69% increase in the risk of death. In 2015 the START and TEMPRANO studies both showed that patients lived longer if they started antiretrovirals at the time of their diagnosis, rather than waiting for their CD4 counts to drop to a specified level.

Other arguments for starting therapy earlier are that people who start therapy later have been shown to have less recovery of their immune systems, and higher CD4 counts are associated with less cancer.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended the granting of marketing authorizations for two new antiretroviral (ARV) medicines, rilpivirine (Rekambys) and cabotegravir (Vocabria), to be used together for the treatment of people with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. The two medicines are the first ARVs that come in a long-acting injectable formulation. This means that instead of daily pills, people receive intramuscular injections monthly or every two months.

The combination of Rekambys and Vocabria injection is intended for maintenance treatment of adults who have undetectable HIV levels in the blood (viral load less than 50 copies/ml) with their current ARV treatment, and when the virus has not developed resistance to certain class of anti-HIV medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INIs).

==== Treatment as prevention ====
A separate argument for starting antiretroviral therapy that has gained more prominence is its effect on HIV transmission. ART reduces the amount of virus in the blood and genital secretions. This has been shown to lead to dramatically reduced transmission of HIV when one partner with a suppressed viral load (&lt;50 copies/ml) has sex with a partner who is HIV negative. In clinical trial HPTN 052, 1763 serodiscordant heterosexual couples in nine countries were planned to be followed for at least 10 years, with both groups receiving education on preventing HIV transmission and condoms, but only one group getting ART. The study was stopped early (after 1.7 years) for ethical reasons when it became clear that antiviral treatment provided significant protection. Of the 28 couples where cross-infection had occurred, all but one had taken place in the control group, consistent with a 96% reduction in risk of transmission while on ART. The single transmission in the experimental group occurred early after starting ART before viral load was likely to be suppressed. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) provides HIV-negative individuals with medication—in conjunction with safer-sex education and regular HIV/STI screenings—in order to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV. In 2011, the journal &quot;Science&quot; gave the Breakthrough of the Year award to treatment as prevention.

In July 2016 a consensus document was created by the Prevention Access Campaign which has been endorsed by over 400 organisations in 58 countries. The consensus document states that the risk of HIV transmission from a person living with HIV who has been undetectable for a minimum of six months is negligible to non-existent, with negligible being defined as &quot;so small or unimportant to be not worth considering&quot;. The Chair of the British HIV Association (BHIVA), Chloe Orkin, stated in July 2017 that &#x27;there should be no doubt about the clear and simple message that a person with sustained, undetectable levels of HIV virus in their blood cannot transmit HIV to their sexual partners.&#x27;

Furthermore, the PARTNER study, which ran from 2010 to 2014, enrolled 1166 serodiscordant couples (where one partner is HIV positive and the other is negative) in a study that found that the estimated rate of transmission through any condomless sex with the HIV-positive partner taking ART with an HIV load less than 200 copies/ml was zero.

In summary, as the WHO HIV treatment guidelines state, &quot;The ARV regimens now available, even in the poorest countries, are safer, simpler, more effective and more affordable than ever before.&quot;

There is a consensus among experts that, once initiated, antiretroviral therapy should never be stopped. This is because the selection pressure of incomplete suppression of viral replication in the presence of drug therapy causes the more drug sensitive strains to be selectively inhibited. This allows the drug resistant strains to become dominant. This in turn makes it harder to treat the infected individual as well as anyone else they infect. One trial showed higher rates of opportunistic infections, cancers, heart attacks and death in patients who periodically interrupted their ART.

=== Guideline sources ===
There are several treatment guidelines for HIV-1 infected adults in the developed world (that is, those countries with access to all or most therapies and laboratory tests). In the United States there are both the International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) (a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization in the US) as well as the US government&#x27;s Department of Health and Human Services guidelines. In Europe there are the European AIDS Clinical Society guidelines.

For resource limited countries, most national guidelines closely follow the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.

====Guidelines====
The guidelines use new criteria to consider starting HAART, as described below. However, there remain a range of views on this subject and the decision of whether to commence treatment ultimately rests with the patient and his or her doctor.

The US DHHS guidelines (published April 8, 2015) state:
* Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all HIV-infected individuals to reduce the risk of disease progression.
* ART also is recommended for HIV-infected individuals for the prevention of transmission of HIV.
* Patients starting ART should be willing and able to commit to treatment and understand the benefits and risks of therapy and the importance of adherence. Patients may choose to postpone therapy, and providers, on a case-by-case basis, may elect to defer therapy on the basis of clinical and/or psychosocial factors.

The newest WHO guidelines (dated September 30, 2015) now agree and state:
* Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated in everyone living with HIV at any CD4 cell count

====Baseline resistance====
Baseline resistance is the presence of resistance mutations in patients who have never been treated before for HIV. In countries with a high rate of baseline resistance, resistance testing is recommended before starting treatment; or, if the initiation of treatment is urgent, then a &quot;best guess&quot; treatment regimen should be started, which is then modified on the basis of resistance testing. In the UK, there is 11.8% medium to high-level resistance at baseline to the combination of efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, and 6.4% medium to high level resistance to stavudine + lamivudine + nevirapine. In the US, 10.8% of one cohort of patients who had never been on ART before had at least one resistance mutation in 2005. Various surveys in different parts of the world have shown increasing or stable rates of baseline resistance as the era of effective HIV therapy continues. With baseline resistance testing, a combination of antiretrovirals that are likely to be effective can be customized for each patient.

===Regimens===
Most HAART regimens consist of three drugs: Two NRTIs (&quot;backbone&quot;)+ a PI/NNRTI/INSTI (&quot;base&quot;). Initial regimens use &quot;first-line&quot; drugs with a high efficacy and low side-effect profile.

The US DHHS preferred initial regimens for adults and adolescents in the United States, as of April 2015, are:
* tenofovir/emtricitabine and raltegravir (an integrase inhibitor)
* tenofovir/emtricitabine and dolutegravir (an integrase inhibitor)
* abacavir/lamivudine (two NRTIs) and dolutegravir for patients who have been tested negative for the HLA-B*5701 gene allele
* tenofovir/emtricitabine, elvitegravir (an integrase inhibitor) and cobicistat (inhibiting metabolism of the former) in patients with good kidney function (gfr &gt; 70)
* tenofovir/emtricitabine, ritonavir, and darunavir (both latter are protease inhibitors)
Both efavirenz and nevirapine showed similar benefits when combined with NRTI respectively.

In the case of the protease inhibitor based regimens, ritonavir is used at low doses to inhibit cytochrome p450 enzymes and &quot;boost&quot; the levels of other protease inhibitors, rather than for its direct antiviral effect. This boosting effect allows them to be taken less frequently throughout the day. Cobicistat is used with elvitegravir for a similar effect but does not have any direct antiviral effect itself.

The WHO preferred initial regimen for adults and adolescents as of June 30, 2013, is:
* tenofovir + lamivudine (or emtricitabine) + efavirenz

=== Special populations ===
==== Acute infection ====
In the first six months after infection HIV viral loads tend to be elevated and people are more often symptomatic than in later latent phases of HIV disease. There may be special benefits to starting antiretroviral therapy early during this acute phase, including lowering the viral &quot;set-point&quot; or baseline viral load, reduce the mutation rate of the virus, and reduce the size of the viral reservoir (See section below on viral reservoirs). The SPARTAC trial compared 48 weeks of ART vs 12 weeks vs no treatment in acute HIV infection and found that 48 weeks of treatment delayed the time to decline in CD4 count below 350 cells per ml by 65 weeks and kept viral loads significantly lower even after treatment was stopped.

Since viral loads are usually very high during acute infection, this period carries an estimated 26 times higher risk of transmission. By treating acutely infected patients, it is presumed that it could have a significant impact on decreasing overall HIV transmission rates since lower viral loads are associated with lower risk of transmission (See section on treatment as prevention). However an overall benefit has not been proven and has to be balanced with the risks of HIV treatment. Therapy during acute infection carries a grade BII recommendation from the US DHHS.

==== Children ====
HIV can be especially harmful to infants and children, with one study in Africa showing that 52% of untreated children born with HIV had died by age 2. By five years old, the risk of disease and death from HIV starts to approach that of young adults. The WHO recommends treating all children less than 5 years old, and starting all children older than 5 with stage 3 or 4 disease or CD4 &lt;500 cells/ml. DHHS guidelines are more complicated but recommend starting all children less than 12 months old and children of any age who have symptoms.

As for which antiretrovirals to use, this is complicated by the fact that many children who are born to mothers with HIV are given a single dose of nevirapine (an NNRTI) at the time of birth to prevent transmission. If this fails it can lead to NNRTI resistance. Also, a large study in Africa and India found that a PI based regimen was superior to an NNRTI based regimen in children less than 3 years who had never been exposed to NNRTIs in the past. Thus the WHO recommends PI based regimens for children less than 3.

The WHO recommends for children less than 3 years:
* abacavir (or zidovudine) + lamivudine + lopinivir + ritonivir
and for children 3 years to less than 10 years and adolescents &lt;35 kilograms:
* abacavir + lamivudine + efavirenz
US DHHS guidelines are similar but include PI based options for children &gt; 3 years old.

A systematic review assessed the effects and safety of abacavir-containing regimens as first-line therapy for children between 1 month and 18 years of age when compared to regimens with other NRTIs. This review included two trials and two observational studies with almost eleven thousand HIV infected children and adolescents. They measured virologic suppression, death and adverse events. The authors found that there is no meaningful difference between abacavir-containing regimens and other NRTI-containing regimens. The evidence is of low to moderate quality and therefore it is likely that future research may change these findings.

==== Pregnant women ====

The goals of treatment for pregnant women include the same benefits to the mother as in other infected adults as well as prevention of transmission to her child. The risk of transmission from mother to child is proportional to the plasma viral load of the mother. Untreated mothers with a viral load &gt;100,000 copies/ml have a transmission risk of over 50%. The risk when viral loads are &lt; 1000 copies/ml are less than 1%. ART for mothers both before and during delivery and to mothers and infants after delivery are recommended to substantially reduce the risk of transmission. The mode of delivery is also important, with a planned Caesarian section having a lower risk than vaginal delivery or emergency Caesarian section.

HIV can also be detected in breast milk of infected mothers and transmitted through breast feeding. The WHO balances the low risk of transmission through breast feeding from women who are on ART with the benefits of breastfeeding against diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition. It also strongly recommends that breastfeeding infants receive prophylactic ART. In the US, the DHHS recommends against women with HIV breastfeeding.

==== Older adults ====
With improvements in HIV therapy, several studies now estimate that patients on treatment in high-income countries can expect a normal life expectancy. This means that a higher proportion of people living with HIV are now older and research is ongoing into the unique aspects of HIV infection in the older adult. There is data that older people with HIV have a blunted CD4 response to therapy but are more likely to achieve undetectable viral levels. However, not all studies have seen a difference in response to therapy. The guidelines do not have separate treatment recommendations for older adults, but it is important to take into account that older patients are more likely to be on multiple non-HIV medications and consider drug interactions with any potential HIV medications. There are also increased rates of HIV associated non-AIDS conditions (HANA) such as heart disease, liver disease and dementia that are multifactorial complications from HIV, associated behaviors, coinfections like hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human papilloma virus (HPV) as well as HIV treatment.

==== Adults with depression ====
Many factors may contribute to depression in adults living with HIV, such as the effects of the virus on the brain, other infections or tumours, antiretroviral drugs and other medical treatment. Rates of major depression are higher in people living with HIV compared to the general population, and this may negatively influence antiretroviral treatment. In a systematic review, Cochrane researchers assessed whether giving antidepressants to adults living with both HIV and depression may improve depression. Ten trials, of which eight were done in high-income countries, with 709 participants were included. Results indicated that antidepressants may be better in improving depression compared to placebo, but the quality of the evidence is low and future research is likely to impact on the findings.

==Concerns==
There are several concerns about antiretroviral regimens that should be addressed before initiating:
* Intolerance: The drugs can have serious side-effects which can lead to harm as well as keep patients from taking their medications regularly.
* Resistance: Not taking medication consistently can lead to low blood levels that foster drug resistance.
* Cost: The WHO maintains a database of world ART costs which have dropped dramatically in recent years as more first line drugs have gone off-patent. A one pill, once a day combination therapy has been introduced in South Africa for as little as $10 per patient per month. One 2013 study estimated an overall cost savings to ART therapy in South Africa given reduced transmission. In the United States, new on-patent regimens can cost up to $28,500 per patient, per year.
* Public health: Individuals who fail to use antiretrovirals as directed can develop multi-drug resistant strains which can be passed onto others.

== Response to therapy ==
=== Virologic response ===
Suppressing the viral load to undetectable levels (&lt;50 copies per ml) is the primary goal of ART. This should happen by 24 weeks after starting combination therapy. Viral load monitoring is the most important predictor of response to treatment with ART. Lack of viral load suppression on ART is termed virologic failure. Levels higher than 200 copies per ml is considered virologic failure, and should prompt further testing for potential viral resistance.

Research has shown that people with an undetectable viral load are unable to transmit the virus through condomless sex with a partner of either gender. The &#x27;Swiss Statement&#x27; of 2008 described the chance of transmission as &#x27;very low&#x27; or &#x27;negligible,&#x27; but multiple studies have since shown that this mode of sexual transmission is impossible where the HIV-positive person has a consistently undetectable viral load. This discovery has led to the formation of the Prevention Access Campaign are their &#x27;U=U&#x27; or &#x27;Undetectable=Untransmittable&#x27; public information strategy, an approach that has gained widespread support amongst HIV/AIDS-related medical, charitable, and research organisations. The studies demonstrating that U=U is an effective strategy for preventing HIV transmission in serodiscordant couples so long as &quot;the partner living with HIV [has] a durably suppressed viral load&quot; include: Opposites Attract, PARTNER 1, PARTNER 2, (for male–male couples) and HPTN052 (for heterosexual couples). In these studies, couples where one partner was HIV-positive and one partner was HIV-negative were enrolled and regular HIV testing completed. In total from the four studies, 4097 couples were enrolled over four continents and 151,880 acts of condomless sex were reported, there were zero phylogenetically linked transmissions of HIV where the positive partner had an undetectable viral load. Following this the U=U consensus statement advocating the use of &#x27;zero risk&#x27; was signed by hundreds of individuals and organisations including the US CDC, British HIV Association and &quot;The Lancet&quot; medical journal. The importance of the final results of the PARTNER 2 study were described by the medical director of the Terrence Higgins Trust as &quot;impossible to overstate&quot;, while lead author Alison Rodger declared that the message that &quot;undetectable viral load makes HIV untransmittable ... can help end the HIV pandemic by preventing HIV transmission.&quot; The authors summarised their findings in &quot;The Lancet&quot; as follows:

This result is consistent with the conclusion presented by Anthony S. Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and his team in a viewpoint published in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;, that U=U is an effective HIV prevention method when an undetectable viral load is maintained.

=== Immunologic response ===
CD4 cell counts are another key measure of immune status and ART effectiveness. CD4 counts should rise 50 to 100 cells per ml in the first year of therapy. There can be substantial fluctuation in CD4 counts of up to 25% based on the time of day or concomitant infections. In one long-term study, the majority of increase in CD4 cell counts was in the first two years after starting ART with little increase afterwards. This study also found that patients who began ART at lower CD4 counts continued to have lower CD4 counts than those who started at higher CD4 counts. When viral suppression on ART is achieved but without a corresponding increase in CD4 counts it can be termed immunologic nonresponse or immunologic failure. While this is predictive of worse outcomes, there is no consensus on how to adjust therapy to immunologic failure and whether switching therapy is beneficial. DHHS guidelines do not recommend switching an otherwise suppressive regimen.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are another class of immune cell that is depleted during HIV infection. However, if ART is initiated before this depletion at around 7 days post infection, ILC levels can be maintained. While CD4 cell counts typically replenish after effective ART, ILCs depletion is irreversible with ART initiated after the depletion despite suppression of viremia. Since one of the roles of ILCs is to regulate the immune response to commensal bacteria and to maintain an effective gut barrier, it has been hypothesized that the irreversible depletion of ILCs plays a role in the weakened gut barrier of HIV patients, even after successful ART.

== Salvage therapy ==
In patients who have persistently detectable viral loads while taking ART, tests can be done to investigate whether there is drug resistance. Most commonly a genotype is sequenced which can be compared with databases of other HIV viral genotypes and resistance profiles to predict response to therapy. Resistance testing may improve virological outcomes in those who have treatment failures. However, there is lack of evidence of effectiveness of such testing in those who have not done any treatment before.

If there is extensive resistance a phenotypic test of a patient&#x27;s virus against a range of drug concentrations can be performed, but is expensive and can take several weeks, so genotypes are generally preferred. Using information from a genotype or phenotype, a regimen of three drugs from at least two classes is constructed that will have the highest probability of suppressing the virus. If a regimen cannot be constructed from recommended first line agents it is termed salvage therapy, and when six or more drugs are needed it is termed mega-HAART.

== Structured treatment interruptions ==
Drug holidays (or &quot;structured treatment interruptions&quot;) are intentional discontinuations of antiretroviral drug treatment. As mentioned above, randomized controlled studies of structured treatment interruptions have shown higher rates of opportunistic infections, cancers, heart attacks and death in patients who took drug holidays. With the exception of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), treatment guidelines do not call for the interruption of drug therapy once it has been initiated.

==Adverse effects==
Each class and individual antiretroviral carries unique risks of adverse side effects.

=== NRTIs ===
The NRTIs can interfere with mitochondrial DNA synthesis and lead to high levels of lactate and lactic acidosis, liver steatosis, peripheral neuropathy, myopathy and lipoatrophy. First-line NRTIs such as lamivudine/emtrictabine, tenofovir, and abacavir are less likely to cause mitochondrial dysfunction.

Mitochondrial Haplogroups(mtDNA), non pathologic mutations inherited from the maternal line, have been linked to the efficacy of CD4+ count following ART. Idiosyncratic toxicity with mtDNA haplogroup is also well studied (Boeisteril et al., 2007).

=== NNRTIs ===
NNRTIs are generally safe and well tolerated. The main reason for discontinuation of efavirenz is neuro-psychiatric effects including suicidal ideation. Nevirapine can cause severe hepatotoxicity, especially in women with high CD4 counts.

=== Protease inhibitors ===
Protease inhibitors (PIs) are often given with ritonavir, a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes, leading to numerous drug-drug interactions. They are also associated with lipodystrophy, elevated triglycerides and elevated risk of heart attack.

=== Integrase inhibitors ===
Integrase inhibitors (INSTIs) are among the best tolerated of the antiretrovirals with excellent short and medium term outcomes. Given their relatively new development there is less long term safety data. They are associated with an increase in creatinine kinase levels and rarely myopathy.

== Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) ==

When people are exposed to HIV-positive infectious bodily fluids either through skin puncture, contact with mucous membranes or contact with damaged skin, they are at risk for acquiring HIV. Pooled estimates give a risk of transmission with puncture exposures of 0.3% and mucous membrane exposures 0.63%. United States guidelines state that &quot;feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, and vomitus are not considered potentially infectious unless they are visibly bloody.&quot; Given the rare nature of these events, rigorous study of the protective abilities of antiretrovirals are limited but do suggest that taking antiretrovirals afterwards can prevent transmission. It is unknown if three medications are better than two. The sooner after exposure that ART is started the better, but after what period they become ineffective is unknown, with the US Public Health Service Guidelines recommending starting prophylaxis up to a week after exposure. They also recommend treating for a duration of four weeks based on animal studies. Their recommended regimen is emtricitabine + tenofovir + raltegravir (an INSTI). The rationale for this regimen is that it is &quot;tolerable, potent, and conveniently administered, and it has been associated with minimal drug interactions.&quot; People who are exposed to HIV should have follow up HIV testing at 6, 12, and 24 weeks.

== Pregnancy planning ==

Women with HIV have been shown to have decreased fertility which can affect available reproductive options. In cases where the woman is HIV negative and the man is HIV positive, the primary assisted reproductive method used to prevent HIV transmission is sperm washing followed by intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF). Preferably this is done after the man has achieved an undetectable plasma viral load. In the past there have been cases of HIV transmission to an HIV-negative partner through processed artificial insemination, but a large modern series in which followed 741 couples where the man had a stable viral load and semen samples were tested for HIV-1, there were no cases of HIV transmission.

For cases where the woman is HIV positive and the man is HIV negative, the usual method is artificial insemination. With appropriate treatment the risk of mother-to-child infection can be reduced to below 1%.

== History ==
Several buyers clubs sprang up since 1986 to combat HIV. The drug zidovudine (AZT), a nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), was not effective on its own. It was approved by the US FDA in 1987. The FDA bypassed stages of its review for safety and effectiveness in order to distribute this drug earlier. Subsequently, several more NRTIs were developed but even in combination were unable to suppress the virus for long periods of time and patients still inevitably died. To distinguish from this early antiretroviral therapy (ART), the term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced. In 1996 two sequential publications in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; by Hammer and colleagues and Gulick and colleagues illustrated the substantial benefit of combining two NRTIs with a new class of antiretrovirals, protease inhibitors, namely indinavir. This concept of three-drug therapy was quickly incorporated into clinical practice and rapidly showed impressive benefit with a 60% to 80% decline in rates of AIDS, death, and hospitalization. It would also create a new period of optimism at the 11th International AIDS Conference that was held in Vancouver that year.

As HAART became widespread, fixed dose combinations were made available to ease the administration. Later, the term combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) gained favor with some physicians as a more accurate name, not conveying to patients any misguided idea of the nature of the therapy. Today multidrug, highly effective regimens are long since the default in ART, which is why they are increasingly called simply ART instead of HAART or cART. This retronymic process is linguistically comparable to the way that the words &quot;electronic computer&quot; and &quot;digital computer&quot; at first were needed to make useful distinctions in computing technology, but with the later irrelevance of the distinction, &quot;computer&quot; alone now covers their meaning. Thus as &quot;all computers are digital now&quot;, so &quot;all ART is combination ART now.&quot; However, the names HAART and cART, reinforced by thousands of earlier mentions in medical literature still being regularly cited, also remain in use. In 1997, the new number of new HIV/AIDS cases in the United States would see its first significant decline at 47%, with credit going to the effectiveness of HAART.

== Research ==
People living with HIV can expect to live a nearly normal life span if able to achieve durable viral suppression on combination antiretroviral therapy. However this requires lifelong medication and will still have higher rates of cardiovascular, kidney, liver and neurologic disease. This has prompted further research towards a cure for HIV.

=== Patients cured of HIV infection ===
The so-called &quot;Berlin patient&quot; has been potentially cured of HIV infection and has been off of treatment since 2006 with no detectable virus. This was achieved through two bone marrow transplants that replaced his immune system with a donor&#x27;s that did not have the CCR5 cell surface receptor, which is needed for some variants of HIV to enter a cell. Bone marrow transplants carry their own significant risks including potential death and was only attempted because it was necessary to treat a blood cancer he had. Attempts to replicate this have not been successful and given the risks, expense and rarity of CCR5 negative donors, bone marrow transplant is not seen as a mainstream option. It has inspired research into other methods to try to block CCR5 expression through gene therapy. A procedure zinc-finger nuclease-based gene knockout has been used in a Phase I trial of 12 humans and led to an increase in CD4 count and decrease in their viral load while off antiretroviral treatment. Attempt to reproduce this failed in 2016. Analysis of the failure showed that gene therapy only successfully treats 11–28% of cells, leaving the majority of CD4+ cells capable of being infected. The analysis found that only patients where less than 40% of cells were infected had reduced viral load. The gene therapy was not effective if the native CD4+ cells remained. This is the main limitation which must be overcome for this treatment to become effective.

After the &quot;Berlin patient&quot;, two additional patients with both HIV infection and cancer were reported to have no traceable HIV virus after successful stem cell transplants. Virologist Annemarie Wensing of the University Medical Center Utrecht announced this development during her presentation at the 2016 &quot;Towards an HIV Cure&quot; symposium. However, these two patients are still on antiretroviral therapy, which is not the case for the Berlin patient. Therefore, it is not known whether or not the two patients are cured of HIV infection. The cure might be confirmed if the therapy were to be stopped and no viral rebound occurred.

In March 2019, a second patient, referred to as the &quot;London Patient&quot;, was confirmed to be in complete remission of HIV. Like the Berlin Patient, the London Patient received a bone marrow transplant from a donor who has the same CCR5 mutation. He has been off antiviral drugs since September 2017, indicating the Berlin Patient was not a &quot;one-off&quot;.

Alternative approaches aiming to mimic one&#x27;s biological immunity to HIV through the absence or mutation of the CCR5 gene is being conducted in current research efforts. The efforts of which are done through the introduction of induced pluripotent stem cells that have been CCR5 disrupted through the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system.

=== Viral reservoirs ===
The main obstacle to complete elimination of HIV infection by conventional antiretroviral therapy is that HIV is able to integrate itself into the DNA of host cells and rest in a latent state, while antiretrovirals only attack actively replicating HIV. The cells in which HIV lies dormant are called the viral reservoir, and one of the main sources is thought to be central memory and transitional memory CD4+ T cells. In 2014 there were reports of the cure of HIV in two infants, presumably due to the fact that treatment was initiated within hours of infection, preventing HIV from establishing a deep reservoir. There is work being done to try to activate reservoir cells into replication so that the virus is forced out of latency and can be attacked by antiretrovirals and the host immune system. Targets include histone deacetylase (HDAC) which represses transcription and if inhibited can lead to increased cell activation. The HDAC inhibitors valproic acid and vorinostat have been used in human trials with only preliminary results so far.

=== Immune activation ===
Even with all latent virus deactivated, it is thought that a vigorous immune response will need to be induced to clear all the remaining infected cells. Strategies include using cytokines to restore CD4+ cell counts as well as therapeutic vaccines to prime immune responses. One such candidate vaccine is Tat Oyi, developed by Biosantech. This vaccine is based on the HIV protein tat. Animal models have shown the generation of neutralizing antibodies and lower levels of HIV viremia.

=== Sequential mRNA Vaccine ===
HIV vaccine development is an active area of research and an important tool for managing the global AIDS epidemic. Research into a vaccine for HIV has been ongoing for decades with no lasting success for preventing infection. The rapid development, though, of mRNA vaccines to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic may provide a new path forward.

Like SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, HIV has a spike protein. In retroviruses like HIV, the spike protein is formed by two proteins expressed by the Env gene. This viral envelope binds to the host cell&#x27;s receptor and is what gains the virus entry into the cell. With mRNA vaccines, mRNA or messenger RNA, contains the instructions for how to make the spike protein. The mRNA is put into lipid-based nanoparticles for drug delivery. This was a key breakthrough in optimizing the efficiency and efficacy of in vivo delivery. When the vaccine is injected, the mRNA enters cells and joins up with a ribosome. The ribosome then translates the mRNA instructions into the spike protein. The immune system detects the presence of the spike protein and B cells, a type of white blood cell, begin to develop antibodies. Should the actual virus later enter the system, the external spike protein will be recognized by memory B cells, whose function is to memorize the characteristics of the original antigen. Memory B cells then produce the antibodies, hopefully destroying the virus before it can bind to another cell and repeat the HIV life cycle. 

SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 have similarities—notably both are RNA viruses—but there are important differences. As a retrovirus, HIV-1 can insert a copy of its RNA genome into the host&#x27;s DNA, making total eradication more difficult. The virus is also highly mutable making it a challenge for the adaptive immune system to develop a response. As a chronic infection, HIV-1 and the adaptive immune system undergo reciprocal selective pressures leading to the evolutionary arms race of coevolution.

Broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies, or bnAbs, have been shown to attach to the Env spike protein envelope regardless of the specific HIV mutations. This bodes well for vaccine development. Complicating matters, though, naive B cells—mature B cells not yet exposed to any antigen and are the progenitors of bnAbs—are rare. Further, the mutation events needed to turn these B cells into bnAbs are also rare. Because of this, there is a growing consensus that an effective HIV vaccine will need to create not only humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity, but a T-cell-mediated immunity.

mRNA vaccines have advantages over traditional vaccines which may help deal with some of the challenges presented by the HIV virus. The mRNA in the vaccine only codes for the protein spike, not the whole virus, so the possibility of reverse transcription, where the virus copies its genetic material into the host&#x27;s genome, is not present. Another advantage when compared to traditional vaccines is the speed of development. mRNA vaccines take months not years, which means a multipart sequential vaccine regime is possible.

Attempts to elicit an immune response that triggers broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) with a single vaccine dose have been unsuccessful. A multipart sequential mRNA vaccine regime, however, might guide the immune response in the right direction. The first shot triggers an immune response for the correct naive B cells. Later vaccinations encourage the development of these cells further, eventually turning them into memory b cells, and later into plasma cells, which can secrete the broadly neutralizing antibodies:

In essence, the sequential immunization approach represents an attempt to mimic Env evolution that would occur with natural infection... In contrast to traditional prime/boost strategies, in which the same immunogen is used repeatedly for vaccination, the sequential immunization approach relies on a series of different immunogens with the goal of eventually inducing bnAb(s).

A Phase 1 clinical trial by Scripps Research and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative of an mRNA vaccine showed that 97 percent of participants had the desired initial “priming” immune response of naive b cells. This is a positive result for developing the first shot in a vaccine sequence. Moderna is partnering with Scripps and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative for a follow-up phase 1 clinical trial of an HIV mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1644) starting later in 2021.

==Drug advertisements==
Direct-to-consumer and other advertisements for HIV drugs in the past were criticized for their use of healthy, glamorous models rather than typical people with HIV/AIDS. Usually, these people will present with debilitating conditions or illnesses as a result of HIV/AIDS. In contrast, by featuring people in unrealistically strenuous activities, such as mountain climbing; this proved to be offensive and insensitive to the suffering of people who are HIV positive. The US FDA reprimanded multiple pharmaceutical manufacturers for publishing such adverts in 2001, as the misleading advertisements harmed consumers by implying unproven benefits and failing to disclose important information about the drugs. Overall, some drug companies chose not to present their drugs in a realistic way, which consequently harmed the general public&#x27;s ideas, suggesting that HIV would not affect you as much as suggested. This led to people not wanting to get tested, for fear of being HIV positive, because at the time (in the 1980s and 1990s particularly), having contracted HIV was seen as a death sentence, as there was no known cure. An example of such a case is Freddie Mercury, who died in 1991, aged 45, of AIDS-related pneumonia.

== Beyond medical management ==
The preamble to the World Health Organization&#x27;s Constitution defines health as &quot;a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.&quot; Those living with HIV today are met with other challenges that go beyond the singular goal of lowering their viral load. A 2009 meta-analysis studying the correlates of HIV-stigma found that individuals living with higher stigma burden were more likely to have poorer physical and mental health. Insufficient social support and delayed diagnosis due to decreased frequency of HIV testing and knowledge of risk reduction were cited as some of the reasons. People living with HIV (PLHIV) have lower health related quality of life (HRQoL) scores than do the general population. The stigma of having HIV is often compounded with the stigma of identifying with the LGBTQ community or the stigma of being an injecting drug user (IDU) even though heterosexual sexual transmission accounts for 85% of all HIV-1 infections worldwide. AIDS has been cited as the most heavily stigmatized medical condition among infectious diseases. Part of the consequence of this stigma toward PLHIV is the belief that they are seen as responsible for their status and less deserving of treatment.

A 2016 study sharing the WHO&#x27;s definition of health critiques its 90-90-90 target goal, which is part of a larger strategy that aims to eliminate the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030, by arguing that it does not go far enough in ensuring the holistic health of PLHIV. The study suggests that maintenance of HIV and AIDS should go beyond the suppression of viral load and the prevention of opportunistic infection. It proposes adding a &#x27;fourth 90&#x27; addressing a new &#x27;quality of life&#x27; target that would focus specifically on increasing the quality of life for those that are able to suppress their viral load to undetectable levels along with new metrics to track the progress toward that target. This study serves as an example of the shifting paradigm in the dynamics of the health care system from being heavily &#x27;disease-oriented&#x27; to more &#x27;human-centered&#x27;. Though questions remain of what exactly a more &#x27;human-centered&#x27; method of treatment looks like in practice, it generally aims to ask what kind of support, other than medical support, PLHIV need to cope with and eliminate HIV-related stigmas. Campaigns and marketing aimed at educating the general public in order to reduce any misplaced fears of HIV contraction is one example. Also encouraged is the capacity-building and guided development of PLHIV into more leadership roles with the goal of having a greater representation of this population in decision making positions. Structural legal intervention has also been proposed, specifically referring to legal interventions to put in place protections against discrimination and improve access to employment opportunities. On the side of the practitioner, greater competence for the experience of people living with HIV is encouraged alongside the promotion of an environment of nonjudgment and confidentiality.

Psychosocial group interventions such as psychotherapy, relaxation, group support, and education may have some beneficial effects on depression in HIV positive people.

== Food insecurity ==
The successful treatment and management of HIV/AIDS is affected by a plethora of factors which ranges from successfully taking prescribed medications, preventing opportunistic infection, and food access etc. Food insecurity is a condition in which households lack access to adequate food because of limited money or other resources. Food insecurity is a global issue that has affected billions of people yearly, including those living in developed countries.

Food insecurity is a major public health disparity in the United States of America, which significantly affects minority groups, people living at or below the poverty line, and those who are living with one or more morbidity. As of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 126,742 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in NYC, of whom 87.6% can be described as living with some level of poverty and food insecurity as reported by the NYC Department of Health on March 31, 2019. Having access to a consistent food supply that is safe and healthy is an important part in the treatment and management of HIV/AIDS. PLWHA are also greatly affected by food inequities and food deserts which causes them to be food insecure. Food insecurity, which can cause malnutrition, can also negatively impact HIV treatment and recovery from opportunistic infections. Similarly, PLWHA require additional calories and nutritionally support that require foods free from contamination to prevent further immunocompromising. Food insecurity can further exacerbate the progression of HIV/AIDS and can prevent PLWHA from consistently following their prescribed regimen, which will lead to poor outcomes.

It is imperative that these food insecurity among PLWHA are addressed and rectified to reduce this health inequity. It is important to recognized that socioeconomic status, access to medical care, geographic location, public policy, race and ethnicity all play a pivotal role in the treatment and management of HIV/AIDS. The lack of sufficient and constant income does limit the options for food, treatment, and medications. The same can be inferred for those who are among the oppressed groups in society who are marginalized and may be less inclined or encouraged to seek care and assistance. Endeavors to address food insecurity should be included in HIV treatment programs and may help improve health outcomes if it also focuses on health equity among the diagnosed as much as it focuses on medications. Access to consistently safe and nutritious foods is one of the most important facets in ensuring PLWHA are being provided the best possible care. By altering the narratives for HIV treatment so that more support can be garnered to reduce food insecurity and other health disparities mortality rates will decrease for people living with HIV/AIDS.

<text>Pemmican (also pemican in older sources) is a mixture of tallow, dried meat, and sometimes dried berries. A calorie-rich food, it can be used as a key component in prepared meals or eaten raw. Historically, it was an important part of indigenous cuisine in certain parts of North America and it is still prepared today.

The name comes from the Cree word (), which is derived from the word (), &#x27;fat, grease&#x27;. The Lakota (or Sioux) word is , originally meaning &#x27;grease derived from marrow bones&#x27;, with the creating a noun, and referring to small pieces that adhere to something. It was invented by the Indigenous peoples of North America.

Pemmican was widely adopted as a high-energy food by Europeans involved in the fur trade and later by Arctic and Antarctic explorers, such as Captain Robert Bartlett, Ernest Shackleton, Richard E. Byrd, Fridtjof Nansen, Robert Falcon Scott, George W. DeLong, Robert Peary, Matthew Henson, and Roald Amundsen.

==Ingredients==
Pemmican has traditionally been made using whatever meat was available at the time: large game meat such as bison, deer, elk, or moose, but also fish such as salmon, and smaller game such as duck; while contemporary pemmican may also include beef. The meat is dried and chopped, before being mixed with rendered animal fat (tallow). Dried fruit may be added: cranberries, saskatoon berries (Cree ), and even blueberries, cherries, chokeberries, and currants—though in some regions these are used almost exclusively for ceremonial and wedding pemmican—and European fur traders have also noted the addition of sugar.

Among the Lakota and Dakota nations, there is also a corn (or pemmican) that does not contain dried meat. This is made from toasted cornmeal, animal fat, fruit, and sugar.

==Traditional preparation==

Traditionally, the meat was cut in thin slices and dried, either over a slow fire or in the hot sun until it was hard and brittle. Approximately of meat are required to make of dried meat suitable for pemmican. This thin brittle meat is known in Cree as and colloquially in North American English as &quot;dry meat&quot;. The was then spread across a tanned animal hide pinned to the ground, where it was beaten with flails or ground between two large stones until it turned into very small pieces, almost powder-like in its consistency. The pounded meat was then mixed with melted fat in an approximate 1:1 ratio by weight. Typically, the melted fat would be suet that has been rendered into tallow. In some cases, dried fruits, such as blueberries, chokecherries, cranberries, or saskatoon berries, were pounded into powder and then added to the meat-fat mixture. The resulting mixture was then packed into rawhide bags for storage where it would cool, and then harden into pemmican.

Today, some people store their pemmican in glass jars or tin boxes. The shelf life may vary depending on ingredients and storage conditions. At room temperature, pemmican can generally last anywhere from one to five years, but there are anecdotal stories of pemmican stored in cool cellars being safely consumed after a decade or more.

A bag of bison pemmican weighing approximately was called a (French for &quot;bull&quot;) by the Métis of Red River. These bags of ( &quot;bulls&quot;), when mixed with fat from the udder, were known as , when mixed with bone marrow, as , and when mixed with berries, as . It generally took the meat of one bison to fill a .

== Serving ==
In his notes of 1874, North-West Mounted Police Sergeant Major Sam Steele recorded three ways of serving pemmican: raw, boiled in a stew called &quot;rubaboo&quot;, or fried, known in the West as a &quot;rechaud&quot;:
==History==

As bone grease is an essential ingredient in pemmican, archaeologists consider evidence of its manufacture a strong indicator of pemmican making. There is widespread archaeological evidence (bone fragments and boiling pits) for bone grease production on the Great Plains by AD 1, but it likely developed much earlier. However, calcified bone fragments from Paleo-Indian times do not offer clear evidence, due to lack of boiling pits and other possible usages.

It has also been suggested that pemmican may have come through the Bering Strait crossing 40–60 centuries ago. The first written account of pemmican is considered to be Francisco Vázquez de Coronado records from 1541, of the Querechos and Teyas, traversing the region later called the Texas Panhandle, who sun-dried and minced bison meat and then would make a stew of it and bison fat. The first written English usage is attributed to James Isham, who in 1743 wrote that &quot;pimmegan&quot; was a mixture of finely pounded dried meat, fat and cranberries.

The voyageurs of the North American fur trade had no time to live off the land during the short season when the lakes and rivers were free of ice. They had to carry all of their food with them if the distance traveled was too great to be resupplied along the way. A north canoe () with six men and 25 standard packs required about four packs of food per . Montreal-based canoemen could be supplied by sea or with locally grown food. Their main food was dried peas or beans, sea biscuit, and salt pork. (Western canoemen called their Montreal-based fellows or &quot;pork-eaters&quot;.) In the Great Lakes, some maize and wild rice could be obtained locally. By the time trade reached the Lake Winnipeg area, the pemmican trade was developed.
Trading people of mixed ancestry and becoming known as the Métis would go southwest onto the prairie in Red River carts, slaughter bison, convert it into pemmican, and carry it north to trade from settlements they would make adjacent to North West Company posts. For these people on the edge of the prairie, the pemmican trade was as important a source of trade goods as was the beaver trade for the Indigenous peoples farther north. This trade was a major factor in the emergence of the new and distinct Métis society. Packs of pemmican would be shipped north and stored at the major fur posts: Fort Alexander, Cumberland House, Île-à-la-Crosse, Fort Garry, Norway House, and Edmonton House.

So important was pemmican that, in 1814, governor Miles Macdonell started the Pemmican War with the Métis when he passed the short-lived Pemmican Proclamation, which forbade the export of pemmican from the Red River Colony.

Alexander Mackenzie relied on pemmican on his 1793 expedition from the Canadas to the Pacific.

North Pole explorer Robert Peary used pemmican on all three of his expeditions, from 1886 to 1909, for both his men and his dogs. In his 1917 book, &quot;Secrets of Polar Travel&quot;, he devoted several pages to the food, stating, &quot;Too much cannot be said of the importance of pemmican to a polar expedition. It is an absolute . Without it a sledge-party cannot compact its supplies within a limit of weight to make a serious polar journey successful.&quot;

British polar expeditions fed a type of pemmican to their dogs as &quot;sledging rations&quot;. Called &quot;Bovril pemmican&quot; or simply &quot;dog pemmican&quot;, it was a beef product consisting, by volume, of protein and fat (i.e., a 2:1 ratio of protein to fat), without carbohydrate. It was later ascertained that although the dogs survived on it, this was not a nutritious and healthy diet for them, being too high in protein. Members of Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s 1914–1916 expedition to the Antarctic resorted to eating dog pemmican when they were stranded on ice during the antarctic summer.
During the Second Boer War (1899–1902), British troops were given an iron ration made of of pemmican and 4 ounces of chocolate and sugar. The pemmican would keep in perfect condition for decades. It was considered much superior to biltong, a form of cured game meats commonly used in Africa. This iron ration was prepared in two small tins (soldered together) that were fastened inside the belts of the soldiers. It was the last ration used and it was used only as a last resort—when ordered by the commanding officer. A man could march on this for 36 hours before he began to drop from hunger.

While serving as chief of scouts for the British Army in South Africa, American adventurer Frederick Russell Burnham required pemmican to be carried by every scout.

Pemmican, likely condensed meat bars, was used as a ration for French troops fighting in Morocco in the 1920s. Pemmican was also taken as an emergency ration by Amelia Earhart in her 1928 transatlantic flight.

A 1945 scientific study of pemmican criticized using it exclusively as a survival food because of the low levels of certain vitamins.

A study was later done by the U.S. military in January 1969, entitled &quot;Arctic Survival Rations, III. The Evaluation of Pemmican Under Winter Field Conditions.&quot; The study found that during a cycle of two starvation periods the subjects could stave off starvation for the first cycle of testing with only 1000 calories worth of pemmican.

== Contemporary uses ==

Today, people in many indigenous communities across North America continue to make pemmican for personal, communal, and ceremonial consumption. Some contemporary pemmican recipes incorporate ingredients that have been introduced to the Americas in the past 500 years, including beef. There are also indigenous-owned companies that produce pemmican or foods based on traditional pemmican recipes for commercial distribution.

<doc id="203314" wikidata="Q210997" url="?curid=203314" title="W. M. Keck Observatory">
<text>The W. M. Keck Observatory is an astronomical observatory with two telescopes at an elevation of 4,145 meters (13,600 ft) near the summit of Mauna Kea in the U.S. state of Hawaii. Both telescopes have aperture primary mirrors, and, when completed in 1993 (Keck I) and 1996 (Keck II), they were the largest optical reflecting telescopes in the world. They have been the third and fourth largest since 2006.

== Overview ==
With a concept first proposed in 1977, telescope designers Terry Mast, of the University of California, Berkeley, and Jerry Nelson of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory had been developing the technology necessary to build a large, ground-based telescope. In 1985, Howard B. Keck of the W. M. Keck Foundation gave $70 million to fund the construction of the Keck I telescope, which began in September 1985. First light occurred on November 24, 1990, using 9 of the eventual 36 segments. When construction of the first telescope was well advanced, further donations allowed the construction of a second telescope starting in 1991. The Keck I telescope began science observations in May 1993, while first light for Keck II occurred on April 27, 1996.
The key advance that allowed the construction of the Keck telescopes was the use of active optics to operate smaller mirror segments as a single, contiguous mirror. A mirror of similar size cast of a single piece of glass could not be made rigid enough to hold its shape precisely; it would sag microscopically under its own weight as it was turned to different positions, causing aberrations in the optical path. In the Keck telescopes, each primary mirror is made of 36 hexagonal segments that work together as a unit. Each segment is 1.8 meters wide and 7.5 centimeters thick and weighs half a ton. The mirrors were made in Lexington, Massachusetts by Itek Optical Systems from Zerodur glass-ceramic by the German company Schott AG. On the telescope, each segment is kept stable by a system of active optics, which uses extremely rigid support structures in combination with three actuators under each segment. During observation, the computer-controlled system of sensors and actuators dynamically adjusts each segment&#x27;s position relative to its neighbors, keeping a surface shape accuracy of four nanometers. As the telescope moves, this twice-per-second adjustment counters the effects of gravity and other environmental and structural effects that can affect mirror shape.

Each Keck telescope sits on an altazimuth mount. Most current 8–10 m class telescopes use altazimuth designs for their reduced structural requirements compared to older equatorial designs. Altazimuth mounting provides the greatest strength and stiffness with the least amount of steel, which, for Keck Observatory, totals about 270 tons per telescope, bringing each telescope&#x27;s total weight to more than 300 tons. Two proposed designs for the next generation 30 and 40 m telescopes use the same basic technology pioneered at Keck Observatory: a hexagonal mirror array coupled with an altazimuth mounting.

Each of the two telescopes has a primary mirror with an equivalent diameter of 10 meters (32.8 ft or 394 in), slightly smaller than the Gran Telescopio Canarias whose primary mirror has an equivalent diameter of 10.4 meters. 

The telescopes are equipped with a suite of cameras and spectrometers that allow observations across much of the visible and near-infrared spectrum.

== Management ==

The Keck Observatory is managed by the California Association for Research in Astronomy, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization whose board of directors includes representatives from Caltech and the University of California. Construction of the telescopes was made possible through private grants of over $140 million from the W.M. Keck Foundation. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) joined the partnership in October 1996 when Keck II commenced observations.

Telescope time is allocated by the partner institutions. Caltech, the University of Hawaii System, and the University of California accept proposals from their own researchers; NASA accepts proposals from researchers based in the United States.

Jerry Nelson, Keck Telescope project scientist, contributed to later multi-mirror projects until his death in June 2017. He conceived one of the Kecks&#x27; innovations, a reflecting surface of multiple thin segments acting as one mirror.

== Instruments ==

; MOSFIRE : MOSFIRE (&quot;Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration&quot;), a third-generation instrument, was delivered to Keck Observatory on February 8, 2012; first light was obtained on the Kecks I telescope on April 4, 2012. A multi-object spectrograph wide-field camera for the near-infrared (0.97 to 2.41 μm), its special feature is its cryogenic Configurable Slit Unit (CSU) that is reconfigurable by remote control in under six minutes without any thermal cycling. Bars move in from each side to form up to 46 short slits. When the bars are removed, MOSFIRE becomes a wide-field imager. It was developed by teams from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the University of California, Santa Cruz, (UCSC). Its co-principal investigators are Ian S. McLean (UCLA) and Charles C. Steidel (Caltech), and the project was managed by WMKO Instrument Program Manager Sean Adkins. MOSFIRE was funded in part by the Telescope System Instrumentation Program (TSIP), operated by AURA and funded by the National Science Foundation; and by a private donation to WMKO by Gordon and Betty Moore.
; DEIMOS : The Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph is capable of gathering spectra from 130 galaxies or more in a single exposure. In &quot;Mega Mask&quot; mode, DEIMOS can take spectra of more than 1,200 objects at once, using a special narrow-band filter.
; HIRES : The largest and most mechanically complex of the Keck Observatory&#x27;s main instruments, the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer breaks up incoming light into its component colors to measure the precise intensity of each of thousands of color channels. Its spectral capabilities have resulted in many breakthrough discoveries, such as the detection of planets outside our solar system and direct evidence for a model of the Big Bang theory. The radial velocity precision is up to one meter per second (1.0 m/s). The instrument detection limit at 1 AU is .
; KCWI : The Keck Cosmic Web Imager is an integral field spectrograph operating at wavelengths between 350 and 560 nm.
; LRIS : The Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph is a faint-light instrument capable of taking spectra and images of the most distant known objects in the universe. The instrument is equipped with a red arm and a blue arm to explore stellar populations of distant galaxies, active galactic nuclei, galactic clusters, and quasars.
; LWS: The Long Wavelength Spectrometer for the Keck I telescope is an imaging, grating spectrometer working in the wavelength range of 3-25 microns. Like NIRC, the LWS was a forward-CASS instrument, and was used for studying cometary, planetary, and extragalactic objects. The LWS is now retired from science observations.
; NIRC : The Near Infrared Camera for the Keck I telescope is so sensitive it could detect the equivalent of a single candle flame on the Moon. This sensitivity makes it ideal for ultra-deep studies of galactic formation and evolution, the search for proto-galaxies and images of quasar environments. It has provided ground-breaking studies of the Galactic Center, and is also used to study protoplanetary disks, and high-mass star-forming regions. NIRC was retired from science observations in 2010.
; NIRC-2 : The second generation Near Infrared Camera works with the Keck Adaptive Optics system to produce the highest-resolution ground-based images and spectroscopy in the 1–5 micrometers (μm) range. Typical programs include mapping surface features on Solar System bodies, searching for planets around other stars, and analyzing the morphology of remote galaxies.
; NIRES : The Near-Infrared Echellette Spectrometer is a spectrograph that provides simultaneous coverage of wavelengths from 0.94 to 2.45 microns.
; NIRSPEC : The Near Infrared Spectrometer studies very high redshift radio galaxies, the motions and types of stars located near the Galactic Center, the nature of brown dwarfs, the nuclear regions of dusty starburst galaxies, active galactic nuclei, interstellar chemistry, stellar physics, and Solar System science.
; OSIRIS : The OH-Suppressing Infrared Imaging Spectrograph is a near-infrared spectrograph for use with the Keck I adaptive optics system. OSIRIS takes spectra in a small field of view to provide a series of images at different wavelengths. The instrument allows astronomers to ignore wavelengths at which the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere shines brightly from emissions of OH (hydroxyl) molecules, thus allowing the detection of objects 10 times fainter than previously available. Originally installed on Keck II, in January 2012 OSIRIS was moved to the Keck I telescope.
; Keck Interferometer : The Interferometer allowed the light from both Keck telescopes to be combined into an baseline, near infrared, optical interferometer. This long baseline gave the interferometer an effective angular resolution of 5 milliarcseconds (mas) at 2.2 μm, and 24 mas at 10 μm. Several back-end instruments allowed the interferometer to operate in a variety of modes, operating in H, K, and L-band near infrared, as well as nulling interferometry. As of mid-2012 the Keck Interferometer has been discontinued for lack of funding.

Both Keck Observatory telescopes are equipped with laser guide star adaptive optics, which compensate for the blurring from atmospheric turbulence. The equipment is the first AO system operational on a large telescope and has been constantly upgraded to expand its capability.

<text>The Inverted Jenny (also known as an Upside Down Jenny, Jenny Invert) is a 24 cent United States postage stamp first issued on May 10, 1918, in which the image of the Curtiss JN-4 airplane in the center of the design is printed upside-down; it is one of the most famous errors in American philately. Only one pane of 100 of the invert stamps was ever found, making this error one of the most prized in philately.

A single Inverted Jenny was sold at a Robert A. Siegel auction in November 2007 for $977,500. In December 2007 a mint never hinged example was sold for $825,000. The broker of the sale said the buyer was a Wall Street executive who had lost the auction the previous month. A block of four Inverted Jennys was sold at a Robert A. Siegel auction in October 2005 for $2.7 million. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, prices fetched by Inverted Jennys receded. Between January and September 2014, five examples offered at auction sold for sums ranging from $126,000 through $575,100. Prices eventually recovered, for on May 31, 2016, a particularly well-centered Jenny invert, graded XF-superb 95 by Professional Stamp Experts, was sold at a Siegel Auction for a hammer price of $1,175,000 The addition of a 15% buyer&#x27;s premium raised the total record high price paid for this copy to $1,351,250. On 15 November 2018, the recently discovered position number 49 stamp was auctioned by Robert A. Siegel Auction Galleries for a hammer price of $1,350,000, with an 18 percent buyer&#x27;s premium raising the total cost to $1,593,000.

On 11 November 2023, another Inverted Jenny stamp was auctioned by Robert A. Siegel Auction Galleries for a new record hammer price of $1,700,000, with an 18% buyer’s premium raising the total cost to $2,006,000.

==Background==
During the 1910s, the United States Post Office made a number of experimental trials of carrying mail by air. These were shown by the first stamp in the world to picture an airplane (captioned as &quot;aeroplane carrying mail&quot;), one of the U.S. Parcel Post stamps of 1912–13. The Post Office finally decided to inaugurate regular service on May 15, 1918, flying between Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City. The Post Office set a controversial rate of 24 cents for the service, much higher than the 3 cents for first-class mail of the time. The postage had a value . The Post Office decided to issue a new stamp just for this rate, patriotically printed in red and blue, and depicting a Curtiss Jenny JN-4HM, the biplane especially modified for shuttling the mail. The stamp&#x27;s designer, Clair Aubrey Huston, apparently troubled to procure a photograph of that modified model (produced by removing the second pilot seat from the JN-4HT to create space for mailbags, and by increasing the fuel capacity). As only six such aircraft existed, there was a 1-in-6 chance that the very plane engraved on the stamp by Marcus Baldwin—Jenny #38262—would be chosen to launch the inaugural three-city airmail run; the plane on the stamp was indeed the first to depart from Washington on May 15, taking off at 11:47 a.m.

The job of designing and printing the new stamp was carried out in a great rush; engraving began only on May 4, and stamp printing on May 10 (a Friday), in sheets of 100 (contrary to the usual practice of printing 400 at a time and cutting into 100-stamp panes). Since the stamp was printed in two colors, each sheet had to be placed into the flat-bed printing press twice, an error-prone process that had resulted in invert errors in stamps of 1869 and 1901, and at least three misprinted sheets were found during the production process and destroyed. It is believed that only one misprinted pane of 100 stamps got through unnoticed.

Many collectors long thought the blue plane portion was printed first, thus it was actually the red frames that were inverted. In fact, the frames were printed first and it is the planes that are upside down. In examples where the plane is so far off center that it overlaps the frames, it can be seen that the blue ink used to print the plane lies atop the red ink used to print the frames. The Smithsonian&#x27;s National Postal Museum offers two explanations for how this might have occurred: either a sheet of printed frames was placed in the press upside down for the printing of the plane; or the printing plate used to print the planes was mounted inverted within the printing press.

Initial deliveries went to post offices on Monday, May 13. Aware of the potential for inverts, a number of collectors went to their local post offices to buy the new stamps and keep an eye out for errors. Collector William T. Robey was one of those; he had written to a friend on May 10 mentioning: “It might interest you to know that there are two parts to the design, one an insert into the other, like the Pan-American issues. I think it would pay to be on the lookout for inverts on account of this.” On May 14, Robey went to the post office to buy the new stamps, and as he wrote later, when the clerk brought out a sheet of inverts, &quot;my heart stood still&quot;. He paid for the sheet, and asked to see more, but the remainder of the sheets were normal. The postal clerk who sold the sheet later said he did not realize the image was inverted because he had never seen an airplane before.

Additional details of the day&#x27;s events are not entirely certain—Robey gave three different accounts later—but he began to contact both stamp dealers and journalists, to tell them of his find. After a week that included visits from postal inspectors who tried to buy it back, and the hiding of the sheet under his mattress, Robey sold the sheet to noted Philadelphia dealer Eugene Klein for $15,000. Klein placed an advertisement on the first page of the May 25, 1918 &quot;Mekeel’s Weekly Stamp News&quot; offering to sell copies of the invert ($250 for fully perforated examples, $175 for stamps with one straight edge), but announced in his following week&#x27;s ad that the entire sheet had been purchased by an individual collector. The buyer, who paid $20,000, was &quot;Colonel&quot; Edward Green, son of Hetty Green.

Klein advised Green that the stamps would be worth more separately than as a single sheet, and Green went along. He donated one invert (which was auctioned off for $300) to the Red Cross in support of its war efforts, while retaining forty-one of the stamps in his own collection, including the plate-number block (initially eight stamps) and several blocks of four. The remainder of the inverts were sold off at steadily increasing prices through Klein, who kept a block of four for himself. Green had one copy placed in a locket for his wife. This gold and glass locket displayed the inverted Jenny on one side, and a &quot;regular&quot; Jenny stamp on the other. This locket was offered for sale for the first time on May 18, 2002, in the Siegel Auction Galleries Rarity Sale. It did not sell in the auction, but the philatelic press reported that a Private Treaty sale was arranged later for an unknown price.

The philatelic literature has long stated that seven of the stamps have been lost or destroyed through theft or mishandling. However, in 2007 a copy came to light that had not been seen since Eugene Klein broke up the sheet, and was offered for auction that June. Several others have been damaged, including one that was sucked into a vacuum cleaner. Apparently Green&#x27;s wife mailed one which, while recovered, is the only cancelled sample. Indeed, no Jenny invert is in pristine condition, because Klein lightly penciled a number on the back of each stamp (from 1 through 10 in the top row to 91 through 100 in the bottom row) so that its original position on the sheet could be identified. For many years, only five examples were known to have survived in never-hinged condition. One of these is the locket copy, which, however has another condition problem: a corner crease at the bottom right probably caused while it was being enclosed behind glass.

==A famous stamp==

Aside from having the biplane printed upside down, the inverted Jenny has become famous for other reasons as well. Benjamin Kurtz Miller, one of the early buyers of these inverts, 10 in all, bought the stamp for $250. Miller&#x27;s inverted Jenny, position 18 on the sheet, was stolen in 1977 but was recovered in the early 1980s though, unfortunately, the top perforations had been cut off to prevent it from being recognized as the stolen Miller stamp. This mutilation made the stamp appear as if it had come from the top row of the sheet, and Klein&#x27;s numbering on the back was accordingly tampered with to disguise the stamp as position 9—an astute piece of misdirection founded in the knowledge that position 9 had never appeared on the market: in fact, the real position 9 emerged decades later as the locket copy. (A genuine straight-edged copy would have cost Miller only $175.) However, that stolen and missing stamp served to drive the value of the other 99 examples even higher. That inverted Jenny was the main attraction in the Smithsonian National Postal Museum&#x27;s &#x27;Rarity Revealed&#x27; exhibition, 2007–2009. The &quot;Inverted Jenny&quot; was the most requested postage stamp for viewing by visitors at the museum.

In 2014, the mass media renewed long-dormant public attention to the 1955 theft of an even more spectacular Jenny specimen. This was a block of four (positions 65, 66, 75, 76) with a vertical red guide-line through its center, owned by the collector Ethel McCoy, which was stolen from a stamp show at a Norfolk hotel where it was being exhibited. The top right stamp from this block has never been found; the two left stamps surfaced in the 1970s as single copies offered in auction catalogues and were recovered by the FBI, although they had been camouflaged by minor mutilation: the portions of the right-edge perforations on which parts of the guide line were originally visible had been trimmed off or abraded to remove the red ink. Mrs. McCoy&#x27;s will had made the American Philatelic Research Library the legal owner of all four stamps in the block. In 2014 Donald Sundman of the Mystic Stamp Company offered $100,000 in reward money—$50,000 for the two stamps that were still missing—to anyone who could bring them to their rightful owner. The offer was publicized in &quot;The New York Times&quot;
and on national network news.
In April 2016, a third stamp from the stolen McCoy block turned up for auction at the Spink USA auction house. The seller was a British citizen in his 20s who claimed to have inherited it from his grandfather and knew little about the stamp&#x27;s provenance. Examination revealed that the stamp came from position 76 in the pane of 100. The American Philatelic Research Library said it will work to take possession of the stamp once an FBI investigation is complete and other legal matters settled. The only stamp that remains missing is position 66.

Philatelic forgers have mutilated at least four additional Inverted Jennys, (positions 4, 5, 6 and 8) disfiguring them with false perforations at the top (these were copies from the first horizontal row of the sheet, all of which originally had a straight edge at the top. The spurious perforations on position 4 have been trimmed away, but traces of them are still discernable along the narrow margin that remains).

In 2019, the 31-year-old musician son of &quot;Bond King&quot; Bill Gross auctioned off a set of five highly valued stamps, including an Inverted Jenny, for a total of $1.9 million, against his father&#x27;s wishes. His father reportedly claims that he himself gave each of his three kids some priceless &quot;Jennys&quot; seven years earlier, on the condition that his grandchildren ultimately inherit them. A more recent sale was in March 2020, when a Jenny (position 95) was sold to collector Trevor Fried in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

On November 15, 2023 an inverted Jenny stamp was sold to a collector, Charles Hack, at a New York Auction for two-million dollars, the highest bid ever made on this rarity. In 1982 the Scott catalogue value for a single invert was $145,000.

The Jenny invert is so famous in the philatelic community—and the general public as well—that the complete history of all sales has been publicly documented.

==A rare swap==
At an auction of the Green estate in 1944, the unique plate number block of eight stamps was sold for $27,000 to the collector Amos Eno, who had four stamps removed from it. The reduced block fetched only $18,250 when Eno&#x27;s estate was sold off ten years later. By 1971, however, its price had risen to $150,000. Eventually, in late October 2005 this plate number block of four stamps was purchased by a then-anonymous buyer for $2,970,000. The purchaser was revealed to be U.S. financier Bill Gross. Shortly after purchasing the Inverted Jennys he proceeded to trade them with Donald Sundman, president of the Mystic Stamp Company, a stamp dealer, for one of only two known examples of the USA 1c Z Grill. By completing this trade, Gross became the owner of the only complete collection of U.S. 19th century stamps.

==2006 forgery==

In November 2006, election workers in Broward County, Florida, claimed to have found an Inverted Jenny affixed to an absentee ballot envelope. The sender did not include any identification with the ballot, which automatically disqualified the ballot. Peter Mastrangelo, executive director of the American Philatelic Society, observed that the stamp was at variance with known copies, due in part to its perforations, although the colors had been reproduced accurately. Further investigations, published in the following month, confirmed that the stamp was a forgery.

==95th anniversary souvenir sheet==
On September 22, 2013, the United States Postal Service issued a souvenir sheet illustrating six examples of the inverted stamp denominated $2 instead of the original 24 cents. The sheets were sold at face value, $12 (the issue was sold only as souvenir sheets of six, and not as individual $2 stamps). Various special packagings for collectors were also offered for a premium.

In addition to the 2.2 million sheets printed with the plane inverted, the Postal Service announced it also printed 100 &quot;non-inverted Jenny&quot; souvenir sheets, with the plane flying right side up. All sheets are individually wrapped in sealed envelopes to recreate the excitement of finding an Inverted Jenny when opening the envelope and to avoid the possibility of discovering a corrected Jenny prior to purchase. Individuals purchasing one of the 100 non-inverted Jenny sheets find a congratulatory note inside the wrapping asking them to call a phone number to receive a certificate of acknowledgement signed by Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe. A non-inverted sheet purchased by Gail and David Robinson of Richmond, Virginia, was sold in June 2014 by Siegel Auctions &quot;Rarities of the World&quot; for $51,750, with the 15% buyer&#x27;s premium.

In 2015 the Postal Service&#x27;s Inspector General called the issuing of a few right side up Jenny airmail sheets improper because regulations do not allow the deliberate creation and distribution of stamp errors. The Service&#x27;s general counsel was aware of the plan but formal approval by the legal department did not occur. It was also found that the Service&#x27;s stamp fulfillment center in Missouri had accidentally failed to distribute 23 of the 30 sheets it was supposed to randomly mix in with orders (the other 70 went to local post offices). Thus not even the promised 100 were made available to the public.

==StampWants giveaway==
As covered in &quot;Linn&#x27;s Stamp News&quot;, on January 12, 2008, StampWants.com (an online marketplace for stamps, now known as bidStart.com) gave away an inverted Jenny, after a year-long promotion the company ran. This represented the most expensive stamp ever given away in any sort of promotion. The winner of the giveaway was John Shedlock, of California, and the stamp was presented to him by the then-current Miss New Jersey, Amy Polumbo.

==Position 49 stamp located after missing for 100 years==
On September 6, 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the Philatelic Foundation had authenticated an inverted Jenny stamp that had not been seen since the original sheet of 100 was divided in 1918. It is a sixth never-hinged copy, the long-missing Jenny at position No. 49. On 15 November 2018, the stamp was auctioned by Robert A. Siegel Auction Galleries for the then-record sum of $1,593,000 (including the 18 percent buyer&#x27;s premium).

==In popular culture==
The Inverted Jenny appeared in several TV shows and films, including the 1985 film &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot;, the 1993 episode &quot;Homer&#x27;s Barbershop Quartet&quot; of the animated TV series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot; episode &quot;The Eternity Ring&quot;, and the 2019 episode &quot;One Big Happy Family&quot; of the legal drama &quot;For the People&quot;. The 2024 song &quot;Invert the Jenny&quot; by Sarah and the Safe Word is themed around the stamp. While not named, Donald Duck find a 24 US¢ inverted-biplane airmail error stamp, described as the rarest american stamp, in the story &quot;The Money Pit&quot;.

<doc id="203317" wikidata="Q210268" url="?curid=203317" title="Richard E. Byrd">
<text>Richard Evelyn Byrd Jr. (October 25, 1888 – March 11, 1957), was an American naval officer, and pioneering aviator, polar explorer, and organizer of polar logistics. Aircraft flights in which he served as a navigator and expedition leader crossed the Atlantic Ocean, a segment of the Arctic Ocean, and a segment of the Antarctic Plateau. He is also known for discovering Mount Sidley, the largest dormant volcano in Antarctica.

Byrd claimed to be the first to reach both the North and South Poles by air. However, there is some controversy as to whether Byrd was actually the first person to reach the North Pole. It is generally believed that the distance Byrd claimed to fly was longer than the possible fuel range of his airplane.

He was a recipient of the Medal of Honor, the United States Armed Forces&#x27; highest military decoration, and the Navy Cross, the second highest honor for valor given by the U.S. Navy.

==Family==
===Ancestry===
Byrd was born in Winchester, Virginia, the son of Esther Bolling (Flood) and Richard Evelyn Byrd Sr. He was a descendant of one of the First Families of Virginia. His ancestors include planter John Rolfe and his wife Pocahontas, William Byrd II of Westover Plantation, who established Richmond, as well as William Byrd I and Robert &quot;King&quot; Carter, a colonial governor. He was also descended from George Yeardley, Francis Wyatt and Samuel Argall. He was the brother of Virginia Governor and U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd, a dominant figure in the Virginia Democratic Party from the 1920s until the 1960s; their father served as Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates for a time.

===Marriage===
On January 20, 1915, Richard married Marie Ames Byrd (d. 1974). He would later name a region of Antarctic land he discovered &quot;Marie Byrd Land&quot; after her, and a mountain range, the Ames Range, after her father. They had four children – Richard Evelyn Byrd III, Evelyn Bolling Byrd Clarke, Katharine Agnes Byrd Breyer, and Helen Byrd Stabler. By late 1924, the Byrd family moved into a large brownstone house at 9 Brimmer Street in Boston&#x27;s fashionable Beacon Hill neighborhood that had been purchased by Marie&#x27;s father, a wealthy industrialist.

Richard has several successful descendants in the United States, including Jordan Byrd, a successful fashion designer of her brand Sora Byrd. She is passionate about birds, traveling, fashion for freedom, yoga, writing poems, among other passions.

===Personal life===
Byrd was friends with Edsel Ford and his father Henry Ford, whose admiration of his polar exploits helped to gain Byrd sponsorship and financing for his various polar expeditions from the Ford Motor Company.

He had a pet dog, Igloo, who accompanied Byrd to the North and South poles and who is buried at the Pine Ridge Pet Cemetery with a tombstone that reads &quot;He was more than a friend.&quot;

==Education and early naval career==
Byrd attended the Virginia Military Institute for two years and transferred to the University of Virginia, before financial circumstances inspired his starting over and taking an appointment to the United States Naval Academy, where he was appointed as a midshipman on May 28, 1908.

On June 8, 1912, Byrd graduated from the Naval Academy and was commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy. On July 14, 1912, he was assigned to the battleship USS &quot;Wyoming&quot;. During service in the Caribbean Sea, Byrd received his first letter of commendation, and later a Silver Lifesaving Medal, for twice plunging fully clothed to the rescue of a sailor who had fallen overboard. In April 1914, he transferred to the armored cruiser USS &quot;Washington&quot; and served in Mexican waters in June following the American intervention in April.

His next assignment was to the gunboat USS &quot;Dolphin&quot;, which also served as the yacht of the Secretary of the Navy. This assignment brought Byrd into contact with high-ranking officials and dignitaries, including then Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Roosevelt. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant (junior grade) on June 8, 1915. During Byrd&#x27;s assignment to &quot;Dolphin&quot;, he was commanded by future Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy, who served as chief of staff to President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II. Byrd&#x27;s last assignment before forced retirement was to the presidential yacht USS &quot;Mayflower&quot;.

On March 15, 1916, Byrd, much to his frustration, was medically retired on three-quarters pay for an ankle injury he suffered on board &quot;Mayflower&quot;. Shortly thereafter, on December 14, 1916, he was assigned as the inspector and instructor for the Rhode Island Naval Militia in Providence, Rhode Island. While serving in this position, he was commended by Brigadier General Charles W. Abbot, the adjutant general of Rhode Island, for making great strides in improving the efficiency of the militia.

==First World War==

Shortly after the entry of the United States into the First World War in April 1917, Byrd oversaw the mobilization of the Rhode Island Naval Militia. He was then recalled to active duty and was assigned to the Office of Naval Operations and served in a desk job as secretary and organizer of the Navy Department Commission on Training Camps. In the autumn of 1917, he was sent to naval aviation school at Pensacola, Florida. He qualified as a naval aviator (number 608) in June 1918. He then commanded naval air forces at Naval Air Station Halifax in Nova Scotia, Canada, from July 1918 until the armistice in November. In that assignment, he was promoted to the permanent rank of lieutenant and the temporary rank of lieutenant commander.

For his services during the war, he received a letter of commendation from Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, which was after World War II converted to a Navy Commendation Medal.

==After the war==
After the war, Byrd volunteered to be a crew member in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s 1919 aerial transatlantic crossing. This mission was historic, as it was the first time the Atlantic Ocean was crossed by an aircraft. It was decided that only men who had not served overseas would be allowed on the mission. Unfortunately for Byrd, his tour of duty in Newfoundland was considered overseas service. Byrd was, however, able to make a valuable contribution, as his expertise in aerial navigation resulted in his appointment to plan the flight path of the mission. Of the three flying boats (NC-1, NC-3, and NC-4) that started from Newfoundland, only Lieutenant Commander Albert Read&#x27;s NC-4 completed the trip on May 18, 1919, achieving the first transatlantic flight.

In 1921, Byrd volunteered to attempt a solo nonstop crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, prefiguring Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s historic flight by six years. Byrd&#x27;s ambition was dashed by then acting Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt Jr., who felt the risks outweighed the potential rewards. Byrd was then assigned to the ill-fated dirigible &quot;ZR-2&quot; (formerly known by the British designation of &quot;R-38&quot;). As fate would have it, Byrd missed his train to take him to the airship on August 24, 1921. The airship broke apart in midair, killing 44 of 49 crew members on board. Byrd lost several friends in the accident, and was involved in the subsequent recovery operations and investigation. The accident affected him deeply and inspired him to make safety a top priority in all of his future expeditions.

Due to reductions in the Navy after the First World War, Byrd reverted to the rank of lieutenant at the end of 1921. During the summer of 1923, then-Lieutenant Byrd and a group of volunteer Navy veterans of the First World War helped found the Naval Reserve Air Station (NRAS) at Squantum Point near Boston, using an unused First World War seaplane hangar which had remained more-or-less intact after the Victory Destroyer Plant shipyard was built on the site. NRAS Squantum was commissioned on August 15, 1923, and is considered to have been the first air base in the Naval Reserve program.

Byrd commanded the aviation unit of the arctic expedition to North Greenland led by Donald B. MacMillan from June to October 1925. Although the expedition was largely unsuccessful (they did not in fact reach the pole) Byrd&#x27;s efforts and the successful contributions of the aviation element during the expedition led to Byrd&#x27;s renown as a pioneer of aircraft in exploration.

During this expedition, Byrd made the acquaintance of Navy Chief Aviation Pilot Floyd Bennett and Norwegian pilot Bernt Balchen, both of whom would later contribute to Byrd&#x27;s expeditions. Bennett served as a pilot in his flight to the North Pole the next year. Balchen, whose knowledge of Arctic flight operations proved invaluable, was the primary pilot on Byrd&#x27;s flight to the South Pole in 1929.

==1926 North Pole flight==

On May 9, 1926, Byrd and Navy Chief Aviation Pilot Floyd Bennett attempted a flight over the North Pole in a Fokker F.VIIa/3m tri-motor monoplane named &quot;Josephine Ford&quot; after the daughter of Ford Motor Company president Edsel Ford, who helped finance the expedition. In addition to Ford contributions, John D. Rockefeller also notably provided funding for the expedition. The flight left from Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and returned to its takeoff airfield, lasting 15 hours and 57 minutes, including 13 minutes spent circling at their Farthest North. Byrd and Bennett said they reached the North Pole, a distance of 1,535 miles (1,335 nautical miles).

When he returned to the United States from the Arctic, Byrd became a national hero. He was thrown a parade in New York City, and Congress passed a special act on December 21, 1926, promoting him to the rank of commander and awarding both Floyd Bennett and him the Medal of Honor. The &quot;Josephine Ford&quot; was flown around the country in celebration. Bennett was promoted to the warrant officer rank of machinist. Byrd and Bennett were presented with Tiffany Cross versions of the Medal of Honor on March 5, 1927, at the White House by President Calvin Coolidge.

===Controversy===

Since 1926, doubts have been raised, defenses made, and heated controversy arose over whether or not Byrd actually reached the North Pole. In 1958, Norwegian-American aviator and explorer Bernt Balchen cast doubt on Byrd&#x27;s statement on the basis of his knowledge of the airplane&#x27;s speed. Balchen said that Bennett had confessed to him months after the flight that Byrd and he had not reached the pole. Bennett, who had not completely healed from the early crash, developed pneumonia after participating in a flight to rescue downed German aviators in Greenly Island, Canada, leading to his death on April 25, 1928. Bennett, though, had started a memoir, given numerous interviews, and wrote an article for an aviation magazine about the flight before his death that all confirmed Byrd&#x27;s version of the flight.

The 1996 release of Byrd&#x27;s diary of the May 9, 1926, flight revealed erased (but still legible) sextant sights that sharply differ from Byrd&#x27;s later June 22 typewritten official report to the National Geographic Society. Byrd took a sextant reading of the Sun at 7:07:10 GCT. His erased diary record shows the apparent (observed) solar altitude to have been 19°25&#x27;30&quot;, while his later official typescript reports the same 7:07:10 apparent solar altitude to have been 18°18&#x27;18&quot;. On the basis of this and other data in the diary, Dennis Rawlins concluded that Byrd steered accurately, and flew about 80% of the distance to the pole before turning back because of an engine oil leak, but later falsified his official report to support his statement of reaching the pole.

Accepting that the conflicting data in the typed report&#x27;s flight times indeed require both northward and southward ground speeds greater than the flight&#x27;s 85-mph airspeed, a Byrd defender posits a westerly-moving anticyclone that tailwind-boosted Byrd&#x27;s ground speed on both outward and inward legs, allowing the distance said to be covered in the time stated (the theory is based on rejecting handwritten sextant data in favor of typewritten alleged dead-reckoning data). This suggestion has been challenged by Dennis Rawlins, who adds that the sextant data in the long-unavailable original official typewritten report are all expressed to 1 second, a precision not possible on Navy sextants of 1926 and not the precision of the sextant data in Byrd&#x27;s diary for 1925 or the 1926 flight, which was normal (half or quarter of a minute of arc).

If Byrd and Bennett did not reach the North Pole, then the first flight over the pole occurred a few days later, on May 12, 1926, with the flight of the airship &quot;Norge&quot; that flew from Spitsbergen (Svalbard) to Alaska nonstop with a crew including Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile, Oscar Wisting, and Lincoln Ellsworth.

==1927 Trans-Atlantic flight==

In 1927, Byrd announced he had the backing of the American Trans-Oceanic Company, which had been established in 1914 by department-store magnate Rodman Wanamaker for the purpose of building aircraft to complete nonstop flights across the Atlantic Ocean. Byrd was one of several aviators who attempted to win the Orteig Prize in 1927 for making the first nonstop flight between the United States and France.

Once again, Byrd named Floyd Bennett as his chief pilot, with Norwegian Bernt Balchen, Bert Acosta, and Lieutenant George Noville as other crewmembers. During a practice takeoff with Anthony Fokker at the controls and Bennett in the co-pilot seat, the Fokker Trimotor airplane, &quot;America&quot;, crashed, severely injuring Bennett and slightly injuring Byrd. As the plane was being repaired, Charles Lindbergh won the prize by completing his historic flight on May 21, 1927. (Coincidentally, in 1925, then Army Air Service Reserve Corps Lieutenant Charles Lindbergh had applied to serve as a pilot on Byrd&#x27;s North Pole expedition, but apparently, his bid came too late.)

Byrd continued with his quest to cross the Atlantic nonstop, naming Balchen to replace Bennett, who had not yet fully recovered from his injuries, as chief pilot. Byrd, Balchen, Acosta, and Noville flew from Roosevelt Field, East Garden City, New York, in the &quot;America&quot; on June 29, 1927. On board was mail from the US Postal Service to demonstrate the practicality of aircraft. Arriving over France the next day, they were prevented from landing in Paris by cloud cover; they returned to the coast of Normandy and crash-landed near the beach at Ver-sur-Mer (known as Gold Beach during the Normandy Invasion on June 6, 1944) without fatalities on July 1, 1927. In France, Byrd and his crew were received as heroes and Byrd was invested as an Officer of the French Legion of Honor by Prime Minister Raymond Poincare on July 6.

After their return to the United States, an elaborate dinner in their honor was held in New York City on July 19. Byrd and Noville were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross by Secretary of the Navy Curtis D. Wilbur at the dinner. Acosta and Balchen did not receive the Distinguished Flying Cross because, at that time, it could only be awarded to members of the armed services and not to civilians.

Byrd wrote an article for the August 1927 edition of &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot; in which he accurately predicted that while specially modified aircraft with one to three crewmen would fly the Atlantic nonstop, another 20 years were needed before it would be realized on a commercial scale.

==Early Antarctic expeditions==

===First Antarctic expedition (1928–1930)===

In 1928, Byrd began his first expedition to the Antarctic involving two ships and three airplanes: Byrd&#x27;s flagship was the &quot;City of New York&quot; (a Norwegian sealing ship previously named &quot;Samson&quot; that had come into fame as a ship some said was in the vicinity of the &quot;Titanic&quot; when the latter was sinking) and the &quot;Eleanor Bolling&quot; (named after Byrd&#x27;s mother); a Ford Trimotor airplane called the &quot;Floyd Bennett&quot; (named after the recently deceased pilot of Byrd&#x27;s previous expeditions) flown by Dean Smith; a Fairchild FC-2W2, NX8006, built 1928, named &quot;Stars And Stripes&quot; (now displayed at the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center); and a Fokker Super Universal monoplane called the &quot;Virginia&quot; (Byrd&#x27;s birth state). A base camp named &quot;Little America&quot; was constructed on the Ross Ice Shelf, and scientific expeditions by snowshoe, dog sled, snowmobile, and airplane began. To increase the interest of youth in arctic exploration, a 19-year-old American Boy Scout, Paul Allman Siple, was chosen to accompany the expedition. Siple went on to earn a doctorate and was probably the only person, other than Byrd himself, to participate in all five of Byrd&#x27;s Antarctic expeditions.

Photographic expeditions and geological surveys were undertaken for the duration of that summer, and constant radio communications were maintained with the outside world. After their first winter, their expeditions were resumed, and on November 28, 1929, the first flight to the South Pole and back was launched. Byrd, along with pilot Bernt Balchen, co-pilot/radioman Harold June, and photographer Ashley McKinley, flew the &quot;Floyd Bennett&quot; to the South Pole and back in 18 hours, 41 minutes. They had difficulty gaining enough altitude, and they had to dump empty gas tanks, as well as their emergency supplies, to achieve the altitude of the Polar Plateau, but they were ultimately successful.

In November 1929, Byrd participated in a privately financed expedition, where he headed the inaugural aircraft crew that successfully flew over the South Pole. Byrd strongly advocated for ski-equipped aircraft, despite the considerable operational, logistical, and maintenance challenges they posed, necessitating the establishment of significant onshore bases to address these issues.
As a result of his achievement, Byrd was promoted to the rank of rear admiral by a special act of Congress on December 21, 1929. As he was only 41 years old at the time, this promotion made Byrd the youngest admiral in the history of the United States Navy. By way of comparison, none of his Annapolis classmates became admirals until 1942, after 30 years of commissioned service. He is one of only four persons including Admiral David Dixon Porter, Arctic explorer Rear Admiral Donald Baxter MacMillan and Rear Admiral Frederic R. Harris, to have been promoted to the rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy without having first held the rank of captain.

After a further summer of exploration, the expedition returned to North America on June 18, 1930. Unlike the 1926 flight, this expedition was honored with the gold medal of the American Geographical Society. This was also seen in the film &quot;With Byrd at the South Pole&quot; (1930), which covered his trip there.

Byrd, by then an internationally recognized, pioneering American polar explorer and aviator, served for a time as Honorary National President (1931–1935) of Pi Gamma Mu, the international honor society in the social sciences. He carried the society&#x27;s flag during his first Antarctic expedition to dramatize the spirit of adventure into the unknown, characterizing both the natural and social sciences.

To finance and gain both political and public support for his expeditions, Byrd actively cultivated relationships with many powerful individuals, including President Franklin Roosevelt, Henry Ford, Edsel Ford, John D. Rockefeller Jr., and Vincent Astor. As a token of his gratitude, Byrd named geographic features in the Antarctic after his supporters.

===Second Antarctic expedition (1933-1934)===
On his second expedition during the summer of 1933–1934, (it was winter in the US, above the equator) Byrd spent five months alone operating a meteorological station, Advance Base, from which he narrowly escaped with his life after suffering carbon monoxide poisoning from a poorly ventilated stove. Unusual radio transmissions from Byrd finally began to alarm the men at the base camp, who then attempted to go to Advance Base. The first two trips were failures due to darkness, snow, and mechanical troubles. Finally, Thomas Poulter, E. J. Demas, and Amory Waite arrived at Advance Base, where they found Byrd in poor physical health. The men remained at Advance Base until October 12. when an airplane from the base camp picked up Dr. Poulter and Byrd. The rest of the men returned to base camp with the tractor. This expedition is described by Byrd in his autobiography &quot;Alone&quot;.

During the summer months the days were long and the evenings existed in twilight. Inside the exploration headquarters Byrd had fashioned a large calendar on the wall, where he would cross off each day as it passed.

A CBS radio station, KFZ, was set up on the base camp ship, the &quot;Bear of Oakland&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Admiral Byrd&quot; program was short-waved to Buenos Aires, then relayed to New York. Sponsored by General Foods, the broadcasts aired on Saturday nights at 10:00 pm and reached #16 on the Hooper rating for the 1933-34 broadcast season, reaching an average audience of 19.1 million.

Byrd&#x27;s Antarctic expedition prompted President Roosevelt and the U.S. Postmaster General to honor the event in 1933 on a U.S. commemorative stamp which greatly helped raise the funding needed to finance Byrd&#x27;s expedition to the Antarctic. The expedition, via the Post Office, sold philatelic subscription Philatelic covers to be serviced at the official USPOD post office set up in the Antarctic exploration base, dubbed &quot;Little America&quot;, and which was officially established on October 6, 1933. All mail sent to the Antarctic required at least one Byrd II 3 cent stamp (pictured), along with sufficient postage amounting to 53 cents. The postage stamp is numbered 753 in the Scott&#x27;s Catalog. The U.S. Post Office contracted with the expedition for this purpose as it had no other means to deliver mail to and from the Antarctic. Approximately 150,000 pieces of such mail went through the special Antarctic post office in 1933 to 1934. As only members of the post office were authorized to postmark and handle mail, Charles F. Anderson, a special representative of the Postmaster General, was assigned to the post office at Little America in Antarctica.

In late 1938, Byrd visited Hamburg, and was invited to participate in the 1938/1939 German &quot;Neuschwabenland&quot; Antarctic Expedition, but declined. (Although Germany was not at war with the United States at this time, Adolf Hitler had been serving as Führer of the German Reich since 1934, and invaded Poland the next year.)

===Antarctic Service Expedition (1939–1940)===
Byrd&#x27;s third expedition was the first one financed and conducted by the United States government. The project included extensive studies of geology, biology, meteorology, and exploration. The innovative Antarctic Snow Cruiser was brought with the expedition, but broke down shortly after arriving.

Within a few months, in March 1940, Byrd was recalled to active duty in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. The expedition continued in Antarctica without him until the last of its participants left Antarctica on March 22, 1941.

==World War II==
As a senior officer in the United States Navy, Byrd was recalled on active duty on March 26, 1942, and served as the confidential advisor to Admiral Ernest J. King. From 1942 to 1945 he served on the South Pacific Island Base Inspection Board, which toured bases in the South Pacific in May and June 1942. The report submitted by the Board describes conditions found at each base and analyses, lessons learned in planning and equipping these bases. The report contains recommendations applicable to the individual bases and others designed to be helpful in the planning of future advanced bases.

On 1 September 1943, in compliance with a series of letters from the President to the Secretary of the Navy, the Commander-in-Chief United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations ordered Byrd to assume direction of a survey and &quot;investigation of certain islands in the East and South Pacific in connection with national defense and commercial air bases and routes.&quot; The members of the Special Navy Mission sailed from Balboa, Canal Zone, on USS &quot;Concord&quot;, Captain Irving Reynold Chambers, commanding, in September 1943. A large explosion at sea on October 7, 1943, took the lives of 24 &quot;Concord&quot; crewmen, including the executive officer, Commander Rogers Elliott. Caused by ignition of gasoline fumes at the stern of the ship, the explosion threw some men overboard, while others were killed from concussion, burns, fractured skulls and broken necks. Several sailors died while trying to save their shipmates. The dead were buried at sea on October 8. On October 23, 1943, Byrd wrote a letter from Nuku Hiva (the largest of the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia) to Chambers, the ship&#x27;s commanding officer, commending him and his crew &quot;for the courage and efficiency&quot; displayed following the explosion that made Byrd &quot;feel proud to be an American. Great heroism was displayed, especially by the men who lost their lives rescuing the wounded.&quot; Byrd completed the Special Mission in December and participated in the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) in 1944 to 1945.

On February 10, 1945, Byrd received the Order of Christopher Columbus from the government of the Dominican Republic. Byrd was present at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945. He was released from active duty on October 1, 1945. In recognition of his service during World War II, Byrd received two awards of the Legion of Merit.

==Later Antarctic expeditions==

===Operation Highjump (1946–1947)===
In 1946, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal appointed Byrd as officer in charge of Antarctic Developments Project. Byrd&#x27;s fourth Antarctic expedition was code-named Operation Highjump. It was the largest Antarctic expedition to date and was expected to last 6–8 months.

The expedition was supported by a large naval force (designated Task Force 68), commanded by Rear Admiral Richard H. Cruzen. Thirteen US Navy support ships (besides the flagship and the aircraft carrier ), six helicopters, six flying boats, two seaplane tenders, and 15 other aircraft were used. The total number of personnel involved was over 4,000.

The armada arrived in the Ross Sea on December 31, 1946, and made aerial explorations of an area half the size of the United States, recording 10 new mountain ranges. The major area covered was the eastern coastline of Antarctica from 150°E to the Greenwich meridian.

Admiral Byrd was interviewed by Lee van Atta of International News Service aboard the expedition&#x27;s command ship USS &quot;Mount Olympus&quot;, in which he discussed the lessons learned from the operation. The interview appeared in the Wednesday, March 5, 1947, edition of the Chilean newspaper &quot;El Mercurio&quot;, and read in part:

Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking – recalled the admiral – is one of the most important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety.

In 1948, the U.S. Navy produced a documentary about Operation Highjump named &quot;The Secret Land&quot;. The film shows live-action footage of the operation, along with a few re-enacted scenes. It won the Academy Award for Best Documentary.

On December 8, 1954, Byrd appeared on the television show &quot;Longines Chronoscope&quot;. He was interviewed by Larry LeSueur and Kenneth Crawford about his Antarctic voyages, and said that Antarctica, in the future, would become the most important place in the world for science.

===Operation Deep Freeze I (1955–1956)===

As part of the multinational collaboration for the International Geophysical Year (IGY) 1957–58, Byrd was appointed as officer in charge of the U.S. Navy Operation Deep Freeze I in 1955–56, which established permanent Antarctic bases at McMurdo Sound, the Bay of Whales, and the South Pole. This was Byrd&#x27;s last trip to Antarctica, and marked the beginning of a permanent U.S. military presence in Antarctica. Byrd spent only one week in the Antarctic, and started his return to the United States on February 3, 1956.

==Death==

Admiral Byrd died in his sleep of a heart ailment at the age of 68 on March 11, 1957, at his home at 7 Brimmer Street in the Beacon Hill neighborhood in Boston. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Memberships==
Byrd was an active Freemason. He was raised (became a Master Mason) in Federal Lodge No. 1, Washington, D.C., on March 19, 1921, and affiliated with Kane Lodge No. 454, New York City, September 18, 1928. He was a member of National Sojourners Chapter No. 3 at Washington. In 1930, Byrd was awarded a gold medal by Kane Lodge.

In 1931, Byrd became a compatriot of the Tennessee Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. He was assigned state membership number 605 and national membership number 50430. He received the society&#x27;s War Service Medal for his service during the First World War.

He was also a member of numerous other patriotic, scientific, and charitable organizations, including the Explorers Club, the American Legion, and the National Geographic Society.

==Honors==
By the time he died, Byrd had amassed 22 citations and special commendations, nine of which were for bravery and two for extraordinary heroism in saving the lives of others. In addition, he received the Medal of Honor, the Silver Lifesaving Medal, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Navy Cross.

Admiral Byrd is the only person to have three ticker-tape parades in New York City (in 1926, 1927, and 1930) given in his honor.

Byrd was one of only four American military officers in history entitled to wear a medal with his own image on it. The others were Admiral George Dewey, General John J. Pershing, and Admiral William T. Sampson. As Byrd&#x27;s image is on both the first and second Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medals, he was the only American entitled to wear two medals with his own image on them.

He was one of the recipients of the Langley Gold Medal, which is awarded by the Smithsonian Institution for outstanding achievement in aviation.

He was the seventh recipient of the prestigious Hubbard Medal awarded by the National Geographic Society for his flight to the North Pole. Other recipients include Robert Peary, Roald Amundsen, and Charles Lindbergh.

Byrd received numerous medals from nongovernmental organizations in honor of his achievements. These included the David Livingstone Centenary Medal of the American Geographical Society, the Loczy Medal of the Hungarian Geographical Society, the Vega Medal of the Swedish Geographical Society, and the Elisha Kent Kane Medal of the Philadelphia Geographical Society.

In 1927, the Boy Scouts of America made Byrd an Honorary Scout, a new category of scout created that same year. This distinction was given to &quot;American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration, and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys ...&quot;.
Also in 1927 the City of Richmond dedicated the Richard Evelyn Byrd Flying Field, now Richmond International Airport, in Henrico County, Virginia. Byrd&#x27;s Fairchild FC-2W2, NX8006, &quot;Stars And Stripes&quot;, is on display at the Virginia Aviation Museum located on the north side of the airport, on loan from the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

In 1929, Byrd received the Silver Buffalo Award from the Boy Scouts of America. Also in 1929, he received the Langley Gold Medal from the Smithsonian Institution.

Lunar crater Byrd is named after him, as was the United States Navy dry cargo ship and the now decommissioned &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class guided missile destroyer .

In 1930, Byrd was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

In Glen Rock, New Jersey, Richard E. Byrd School was dedicated in 1931.

On March 31, 1934, during a regularly scheduled broadcast, Admiral Byrd was awarded the CBS Medal for Distinguished Contribution to Radio. Byrd&#x27;s short-wave relay broadcasts, from his second Antarctic expedition, established a new chapter of communication history. Byrd was the sixth individual to receive this award.

The Institute of Polar Studies at the Ohio State University officially changed its name to the Byrd Polar Research Center (BPRC) on January 21, 1987, after it acquired Byrd&#x27;s expeditionary records, personal papers, and other memorabilia in 1985 from the estate of Marie A. Byrd, the late wife of Admiral Byrd. His papers served as the nucleus for establishment of the BPRC Polar Archival Program in 1990. In 1958. the Richard Byrd library, part of the Fairfax County Public Library system opened in Springfield, Virginia.

Richard E. Byrd Elementary School, a Department of Defense school located in Negishi (Yokohama, Japan) opened on September 20, 1948. The name was changed to R.E. Byrd Elementary School on April 5, 1960.

Memorials to Byrd can be found in two cities in New Zealand (Wellington and Dunedin). Byrd used New Zealand as his departure point for several of his Antarctic expeditions.

The 50th anniversary of Byrd&#x27;s first flight over the South Pole was commemorated in a set of two postage stamps by Australian Antarctic Territory in 1979, and a commemorative flag was designed.

The long-range short-wave voice transmissions from Byrd&#x27;s Antarctic expedition in 1934 were named an IEEE Milestone in 2001.

Admiral Richard E. Byrd Middle School, located in Frederick County, Virginia, was opened in 2005, and is decorated with pictures and letters from Byrd&#x27;s life and career.

He was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa as an honorary member at the University of Virginia.

Byrd was inducted into the International Air and Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air and Space Museum in 1968.

Richard E. Byrd Middle School in Sun Valley, California, is named after Admiral Byrd. The school opened in its present location in 2008 after its original location was converted to Sun Valley High School.

==Popular culture==
Jacques Vallée in his book &quot;Confrontations&quot; mentions a &quot;spurious story&quot; about &quot;&#x27;holes in the pole&#x27; allegedly found by Admiral Byrd&quot;, when he quotes Clint Chapin of the &quot;Copper Medic&quot; case as believing the UFOs came from inside the earth.

In &quot;Great Circle&quot; by Maggie Shipstead, Byrd and the Little America bases are the final stop in Marian Graves&#x27; journey to circle the globe by flight over the North and South Poles.

==Military awards==
Admiral Byrd was one of the most highly decorated officers in the history of the United States Navy. He is, probably, the only individual to receive the Medal of Honor, Navy Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Silver Life Saving Medal. He also was one of a very few individuals to receive all three Antarctic expedition medals issued for expeditions prior to the Second World War.

===Decorations and medals===
Note – The dates on the table below are the year the award was received and not necessarily the year of the actions the award recognizes.
Byrd was posthumously eligible for the Antarctic Service Medal, established in 1960, for his participation in the Antarctic expeditions Operation Highjump (1946 to 1947) and Operation Deep Freeze (1955 to 1956).

Byrd also received numerous other awards from governmental and private entities in the United States.

Rear Admiral Byrd did much toward the difficult task of organizing the expedition, which was accomplished in one fourth of the time generally necessary for such undertakings. In spite of a short operating season, he established two Antarctic bases 1,500 miles apart, where valuable scientific and economic investigations are now being carried on. With the , he penetrated unknown and dangerous seas where important discoveries were made; in addition to which he made four noteworthy flights, resulting in the discovery of new mountain ranges, islands, more than a hundred thousand square miles of area, a peninsula and 700 miles of hitherto unknown stretches of the Antarctic coast. The operations of the Antarctic Service have been a credit to the Government of the United States. His qualities of leadership and unselfish devotion to duty are in accordance with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

<text>A Ritchey–Chrétien telescope (RCT or simply RC) is a specialized variant of the Cassegrain telescope that has a hyperbolic primary mirror and a hyperbolic secondary mirror designed to eliminate off-axis optical errors (coma). The RCT has a wider field of view free of optical errors compared to a more traditional reflecting telescope configuration. Since the mid 20th century, a majority of large professional research telescopes have been Ritchey–Chrétien configurations; some well-known examples are the Hubble Space Telescope, the Keck telescopes and the ESO Very Large Telescope.

==History==
The Ritchey–Chrétien telescope was invented in the early 1910s by American astronomer George Willis Ritchey and French astronomer Henri Chrétien. Ritchey constructed the first successful RCT, which had an aperture diameter of in 1927 (Ritchey 24-inch reflector). The second RCT was a instrument constructed by Ritchey for the United States Naval Observatory; that telescope is still in operation at the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station.

==Design==
As with the other Cassegrain-configuration reflectors, the Ritchey–Chrétien telescope (RCT) has a very short optical tube assembly and compact design for a given focal length. The RCT offers good off-axis optical performance, but its mirrors require sophisticated techniques to manufacture and test. Hence the Ritchey–Chrétien configuration is most commonly found on high-performance professional telescopes.

===Two-mirror foundation===
A telescope with only one curved mirror, such as a Newtonian telescope, will always have aberrations. If the mirror is spherical, it will suffer primarily from spherical aberration. If the mirror is made parabolic, to correct the spherical aberration, then it still suffers from coma and astigmatism, since there are no additional design parameters one can vary to eliminate them. With two non-spherical mirrors, such as the Ritchey–Chrétien telescope, coma can be eliminated as well, by making the two mirrors&#x27; contribution to total coma cancel. This allows a larger useful field of view. However, such designs still suffer from astigmatism.

The basic Ritchey–Chrétien two-surface design is free of third-order coma and spherical aberration. However, the two-surface design does suffer from fifth-order coma, severe large-angle astigmatism, and comparatively severe field curvature.

===Further corrections by a third element===
When focused midway between the sagittal and tangential focusing planes, stars appear as circles, making the Ritchey–Chrétien well suited for wide field and photographic observations.
The remaining aberrations of the two-element basic design may be improved with the addition of smaller optical elements near the focal plane. 

Astigmatism can be cancelled by including a third curved optical element. When this element is a mirror, the result is a three-mirror anastigmat. Alternatively, a RCT may use one or several low-power lenses in front of the focal plane as a field-corrector to correct astigmatism and flatten the focal surface, as for example the SDSS telescope and the VISTA telescope; this can allow a field-of-view up to around 3° diameter.

The Schmidt camera can deliver even wider fields up to about 7°. However, the Schmidt requires a full-aperture corrector plate, which restricts it to apertures below 1.2 meters, while a Ritchey–Chrétien can be much larger. Other telescope designs with front-correcting elements are not limited by the practical problems of making a multiply-curved Schmidt corrector plate, such as the Lurie–Houghton design.

===Aperture obstruction===
In a Ritchey–Chrétien design, as in most Cassegrain systems, the secondary mirror blocks a central portion of the aperture. This ring-shaped entrance aperture significantly reduces a portion of the modulation transfer function (MTF) over a range of low spatial frequencies, compared to a full-aperture design such as a refractor. This MTF notch has the effect of lowering image contrast when imaging broad features. In addition, the support for the secondary (the spider) may introduce diffraction spikes in images.

===Mirrors===
The radii of curvature of the primary and secondary mirrors, respectively, in a two-mirror Cassegrain configuration are:

:formula_1
and

:formula_2,

where
* formula_3 is the effective focal length of the system,
* formula_4 is the back focal length (the distance from the secondary to the focus),
* formula_5 is the distance between the two mirrors and
* formula_6 is the secondary magnification.

If, instead of formula_4 and formula_5, the known quantities are the focal length of the primary mirror, formula_9, and the distance to the focus behind the primary mirror, formula_10, then formula_11 and formula_12.

For a Ritchey–Chrétien system, the conic constants formula_13 and formula_14 of the two mirrors are chosen so as to eliminate third-order spherical aberration and coma; the solution is:

:formula_15
and
:formula_16.

Note that formula_13 and formula_14 are less than formula_19 (since formula_20), so both mirrors are hyperbolic. (The primary mirror is typically quite close to being parabolic, however.)

The hyperbolic curvatures are difficult to test, especially with equipment typically available to amateur telescope makers or laboratory-scale fabricators; thus, older telescope layouts predominate in these applications. However, professional optics fabricators and large research groups test their mirrors with interferometers. A Ritchey–Chrétien then requires minimal additional equipment, typically a small optical device called a null corrector that makes the hyperbolic primary look spherical for the interferometric test. On the Hubble Space Telescope, this device was built incorrectly (a reflection from an un-intended surface leading to an incorrect measurement of lens position) leading to the error in the Hubble primary mirror.

Incorrect null correctors have led to other mirror fabrication errors as well, such as in the New Technology Telescope.

===Additional flat mirrors===
In practice, each of these designs may also include any number of flat &quot;fold mirrors&quot;, used to bend the optical path into more convenient configurations. This article only discusses the mirrors required for forming an image, not those for placing it in a convenient location.

==Examples of large Ritchey–Chrétien telescopes==
Ritchey intended the 100-inch Mount Wilson Hooker telescope (1917) and the 200-inch (5 m) Hale Telescope to be RCTs. His designs would have provided sharper images over a larger usable field of view compared to the parabolic designs actually used. However, Ritchey and Hale had a falling-out. With the 100-inch project already late and over budget, Hale refused to adopt the new design, with its hard-to-test curvatures, and Ritchey left the project. Both projects were then built with traditional optics. Since then, advances in optical measurement and fabrication have allowed the RCT design to take over – the Hale telescope, dedicated in 1948, turned out to be the last world-leading telescope to have a parabolic primary mirror.

<text>George Willis Ritchey (December 31, 1864 – November 4, 1945) was an American optician and telescope maker and astronomer born at Tuppers Plains, Ohio.

Ritchey was educated as a furniture maker. He coinvented the Ritchey–Chrétien (R–C) reflecting telescope along with Henri Chrétien. The R-C prescription remains the predominant optical design for telescopes and has since been used for the majority of major ground-based and space-based telescopes.

He worked closely with George Ellery Hale, first at Yerkes Observatory and later at Mt. Wilson Observatory. He played a major role in designing the mountings and making the mirrors of the Mt. Wilson and telescopes. Hale and Ritchey had a falling-out in 1919, and Ritchey eventually went to Paris where he promoted the construction of very large telescopes. He returned to America in 1930 and obtained a contract to build a Ritchey-Chrétien telescope for the U.S. Naval Observatory. This last telescope produced by Ritchey remains in operation at the U.S. Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In 1924, he received the Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Société astronomique de France, the French astronomical society. Craters on Mars and the Moon were named in his honor.

A very readable biography of Ritchey and Hale is in Don Osterbrock&#x27;s book &quot;Pauper and Prince - Ritchey, Hale and the Big American Telescopes&quot; (The university of Arizona Press, 1993) where the idiosyncratic personalities of both Ritchey and Hale are exposed.

Known for his roles on stage and screen, he has received numerous accolades including a BAFTA Award, two Emmy Awards, two Tony Awards, and an Olivier Award.

Cumming also starred in the CBS series &quot;Instinct&quot; (2018–2019), the Apple TV+ series &quot;Schmigadoon!&quot; (2021–2023) and presents the Peacock reality game show &quot;The Traitors&quot;. Cumming has written a novel, &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2002), and two memoirs in 2014 and 2019.

==Early life==
Cumming was born on 27 January 1965 in Aberfeldy, Perthshire, Scotland. His mother, Mary Darling, was an insurance company secretary and his father, Alex Cumming, was the head forester of Panmure Estate, which is located near Carnoustie, on the east coast of Scotland, and is where Cumming grew up. He has described the environment as &quot;feudal&quot;. He has a brother, Tom, who is six years older, and a niece and two nephews. Cumming attended Monikie Primary School and Carnoustie High School.

In his autobiography &quot;Not My Father&#x27;s Son&quot;, Cumming describes the emotional and physical violence his father inflicted on him in his childhood. His mother found it impossible to obtain a divorce until she was financially independent. Cumming said that, after his early 20s, he did not have any communication with his father until just before the filming of his episode of the series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; He then found out his father had believed that Cumming was not his biological son. Later, Cumming and his brother took DNA tests that proved they were indeed his biological children.

Cumming said that his difficult childhood taught him how to act by &quot;needing to suppress my own emotions and feelings around him [his father] when I was a little boy&quot;. He has described himself as having been a voracious reader as a child, particularly of &quot;The Famous Five&quot; series by Enid Blyton.

== Career ==
=== 1984–1999 ===
In 1984, Cumming made his television debut in ITV Granada&#x27;s &quot;Travelling Man&quot;, before going on to appear later in the 1980s in the Scottish Television series &quot;Take the High Road&quot;, &quot;Taggart&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Stone&quot;. Cumming made his film debut in Gillies MacKinnon&#x27;s short film &quot;Passing Glory&quot; in 1986. His breakthrough television role was as Bernard Bottle in the Christmas 1991 BBC comedy &quot;Bernard and the Genie&quot;, a Richard Curtis-scripted film in which he starred alongside Lenny Henry and Rowan Atkinson. He also featured in a comic relief sketch in 1993 on the popular UK television show Blind Date with Atkinson playing Mr. Bean. Cumming went on to star as flight attendant Sebastian Flight in the BBC2 sitcom &quot;The High Life&quot; in 1995. The series was written by Cumming and co-star Forbes Masson, continuing an acting-writing partnership the two had developed since their drama school days. Also in 1995, Cumming appeared in the series &quot;Ghosts&quot;.

His feature film debut came in 1992 when he starred alongside Sandrine Bonnaire and Bruno Ganz in Ian Sellar&#x27;s &quot;Prague&quot;, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and earned him the Best Actor award at the Atlantic Film Festival and a Scottish BAFTA Best Actor nomination. American audiences first saw him portraying the smarmy Sean Walsh, an unwanted suitor of Minnie Driver&#x27;s character, in &quot;Circle of Friends&quot;, an Irish film released in 1995. Also, in 1995, he played Boris Ivanovich Grishenko in the James Bond film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;. He also played Mr. Elton in &quot;Emma&quot; in 1996.

In 1993, he received great critical acclaim and the TMA Best Actor award for playing the title role in the 1993 English Touring Theatre&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (playing opposite his then-wife, Hilary Lyon, in the role of Ophelia).

He gained prominence for his role as The Master of Ceremonies in Sam Mendes&#x27;s 1993 revival of the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; in London&#x27;s West End opposite Jane Horrocks as Sally Bowles. He received an Olivier Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical. He reprised the role in 1998 for the Mendes-Rob Marshall Broadway revival, this time opposite Natasha Richardson as Sally Bowles. He won a Tony Award, Drama Desk Award and Outer Critics Circle Award for his performance. Cumming had a minor role in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s final film, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; (1999), as a hotel clerk who humorously flirts with Tom Cruise&#x27;s character; according to Cumming, he was required to go through six auditions for the role. His first film in the United States was 1997&#x27;s &quot;Romy and Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion&quot;, playing Sandy Frink opposite Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino.

=== 2000–2011 ===
Cumming co-wrote, co-directed, co-produced and co-starred in the ensemble film &quot;The Anniversary Party&quot; with friend and former &quot;Cabaret&quot; co-star Jennifer Jason Leigh in 2001. Other US stage roles include Otto in the 2001 Broadway production of &quot;Design for Living&quot; by Noël Coward and Mack the Knife in the Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill musical &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; opposite Cyndi Lauper. Cumming performed alongside Dianne Wiest in Classic Stage Company&#x27;s production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot;, directed by Viacheslav Dolgachev. In 2002, Cumming and then-boyfriend Nick Philippou formed the production company The Art Party. The company&#x27;s first and only play was the first English production of Jean Genet&#x27;s play &quot;Elle&quot;, which Cumming had adapted from a literal translation by Terri Gordon. The company closed in 2003. Cumming&#x27;s novel, &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Tale&quot;, was published in 2002.
He has also written articles for magazines, notably as a contributing editor for &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, writing on the haute couture shows in Paris, as well as what it was like for him dressing as a woman for a day. He also contributed articles to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Modern Painters&quot;, &quot;Out&quot;, &quot;Black Book&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. He has written introductions and prefaces to various books, including the works of Nancy Mitford, Andy Warhol and Christopher Isherwood, and wrote a chapter of &quot;If You Had Five Minutes with the President&quot;, a collection of 55+ essays by members or supporters of The Creative Coalition.

In 2006, he returned to the West End playing the lead role in &quot;Bent&quot;, a play about homosexuals in Germany under the Nazis. In 2007, he took the lead role in the National Theatre of Scotland&#x27;s production of &quot;The Bacchae&quot;, directed by John Tiffany, which premiered at the Edinburgh International Festival in August, transferring to the Lyric Theatre in London and then to Lincoln Center, New York, winning him the Herald Archangel award. Cumming introduced &quot;Masterpiece Mystery!&quot; for PBS, beginning in 2008. He played Eli Gold on the CBS television show &quot;The Good Wife&quot;.

He has also made several documentaries: &quot;My Brilliant Britain&quot;, about Scottish humour, &quot;The Real Cabaret&quot; in which he investigated the Weimar cabaret artistes, and the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in 2010 in which he discovered his maternal grandfather was a war hero who had died playing Russian roulette.

=== 2012–present ===
He collaborated again with Tiffany and the National Theatre of Scotland in 2012, playing all the roles in &quot;Macbeth&quot;. He brought this critically acclaimed production of &quot;Macbeth &quot;to New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center in 2012 and to a 73-show Broadway engagement at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in 2013. &quot;Macbeth&quot; concluded its run on Broadway on 14 July 2013.

In October 2013, Cumming appeared in the music video for &quot;City of Angels&quot; by Thirty Seconds to Mars. In 2014, he published his autobiography, &quot;Not My Father&#x27;s Son&quot;, which deals with both his experiences growing up with an abusive father and the discoveries he made about his maternal grandfather&#x27;s life while filming &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;. That same year he returned again to Broadway to star in Roundabout Theater Company&#x27;s revival production of &quot;Cabaret&quot;, directed again by Sam Mendes. Starring opposite Michelle Williams, &quot;Cabaret&quot; opened 24 April 2014 and closed 29 March 2015. The run was extended originally from its 24-week engagement.

Starting in 2022, Cumming partnered with British-Australian actress Miriam Margolyes in a television series entitled &quot;Miriam and Alan: Lost in Scotland&quot;. The series follows the pair as they travel in a motorhome and explore Scotland. That same year, Cumming appeared in &quot;My Old School&quot;, a documentary about the case of Brandon Lee, a 32-year-old man exposed in 1995 as having attended a Scottish secondary school in the guise of a 17-year-old. Cumming appeared as an avatar for Lee, who did not want to appear on camera for the film, lip syncing to audio of his interviews. Cumming had previously planned to play Lee in a theatrical production in the late 90s which failed to materialize.

In June 2021, Cumming was artistic director of the Adelaide Cabaret Festival, as announced in June 2020. Later that year, he played Mayor Aloysius Menlove, the closeted small-town mayor of Schmigadoon, in the Apple TV+ comedy musical series &quot;Schmigadoon!&quot; Since 2023, Cumming hosts the American version of the reality TV series &quot;The Traitors&quot;.

==Activism and charity==

Cumming has promoted LGBT rights, MC-ing and attending fundraisers for organisations such as the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), and taking part in an Equality Network video campaign, from New York, promoting the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Scotland. Cumming also supports several AIDS charities, including the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AMFAR) and Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, and is also a patron of NORM-UK, an English-registered charity concerned with foreskin health and matters related to circumcision; he has condemned the practice of routine infant circumcision, particularly in the United States, where it is common. Cumming recorded a duet of &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; with Liza Minnelli to raise money for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS and 11 September Fund.

In 2005, he released an award-winning fragrance called &quot;Cumming&quot; and a related line of scented bath lotion and body wash. A second fragrance was launched in 2011, named &quot;Second (Alan) Cumming&quot;, with all proceeds going to charity. In 2014, Cumming was a supporter and activist for the Scottish &#x27;Yes&#x27; campaign in the run-up to Scotland&#x27;s referendum on independence in September 2014. In October 2014, Cumming and the Broadway cast of &quot;Cabaret&quot; collected donations for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS during the &quot;Gypsy of the Year&quot; fundraising season.

In October 2023, Cumming signed the Artists4Ceasefire open letter to Joe Biden, President of the United States, calling for a ceasefire of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.

==Personal life==
Cumming is bisexual. His relationships include an eight-year marriage to actress Hilary Lyon, a two-year relationship with actress Saffron Burrows and a six-year relationship with theatre director Nick Philippou. In 2006, Cumming stated that he &quot;would dearly like to adopt a child&quot;, but that his life was &quot;too hectic&quot; for the rearing of children.

Cumming and his partner, illustrator Grant Shaffer, dated for two years before becoming civil partners at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, London, on 7 January 2007. Cumming and Shaffer legally married in New York on 7 January 2012, the fifth anniversary of their London union.

<text>Soul Asylum is an American rock band formed in 1981 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Their 1993 hit &quot;Runaway Train&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song.

The band was originally called Loud Fast Rules, with a lineup consisting of Dave Pirner, Dan Murphy, Karl Mueller, and Pat Morley. They changed their name to Soul Asylum in 1983. Morley was replaced by Grant Young in 1984.

The band recorded three albums with Twin/Tone Records and two with A&amp;M Records, with little commercial success. In 1992, they released the triple-platinum album &quot;Grave Dancers Union&quot;, featuring &quot;Runaway Train&quot;. The band played at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton early the next year. They also scored a platinum record with the album &quot;Let Your Dim Light Shine&quot; three years later. In 1998 they recorded &quot;Candy from a Stranger.&quot; The band released four more albums over the next 15 years. Their most recent releases are &quot;Hurry Up and Wait&quot; in 2020, their twelfth studio release; and &quot;Slowly But Shirley&quot; in 2024, their thirteenth release.

Mueller was diagnosed with cancer in 2004, and the band organized a benefit concert on his behalf. Mueller died a year later.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
The group was an outgrowth of a previous band, Loud Fast Rules, formed in 1981 by drummer and lead vocalist Dave Pirner, guitarist and backing vocalist Dan Murphy, and bassist Karl Mueller. Pirner switched to rhythm guitar, and Pat Morley took over on drums. 
As Loud Fast Rules, two of their songs were released on the 1982 Reflex Records cassette compilation &quot;Barefoot and Pregnant&quot;.
On the following Reflex compilation, &quot;Kitten&quot; (recorded live at Goofy&#x27;s Upper Deck), they were billed as Proud Crass Fools.
Soul Asylum began performing around the Minneapolis–St. Paul area (including the First Avenue nightclub) and quickly developed a core following while becoming known for their powerful, dynamic stage shows.

Their 1984 debut album, &quot;Say What You Will... Everything Can Happen&quot; was originally released on LP and cassette by local record label Twin/Tone as a nine-song EP. It is out of print but was re-released on CD as &quot;Say What You Will, Clarence...Karl Sold the Truck&quot;, which includes five additional tracks that were cut from the original album. Between the release of &quot;Say What You Will&quot; and their second album, Grant Young joined the group, taking over the drums from Morley. In 1986, Soul Asylum released three albums: &quot;Made to Be Broken&quot;, &quot;Time&#x27;s Incinerator&quot; (on cassette only) and &quot;While You Were Out&quot;.

The band toured relentlessly in its early years, opening for other American touring bands and later performing as a headliner act after gaining exposure on the &quot;Flip Your Wig&quot; tour with fellow Twin Cities band Hüsker Dü in early 1986. Contrasted with some of the popular underground and alternative styles at the time, audiences were struck by the band&#x27;s onstage swagger, scruffy Midwestern appearance and extremely loud, frenetic sound, mixing tuneful but unrestrained punk, hardcore, 1970s rock, country and self-effacing kitsch. One early review described their sound as &quot;some unholy mix of Kiss and Hank Williams thrown under the wheels of a runaway train.&quot; All elements contributed to the band&#x27;s being described as a &quot;grunge precursor&quot;, a claim often recited in comparisons between pre-Nirvana Minneapolis and Seattle bands. Despite critical acclaim locally and internationally, they remained unknown to a larger U.S. audience and radio market.

===Mainstream popularity and success: 1988–1999===

The group signed with A&amp;M Records in 1988. Their first offering on that label was &quot;Clam Dip &amp; Other Delights&quot; (1989), the title and cover art being a parody of &quot;Whipped Cream &amp; Other Delights&quot;, by A&amp;M Records co-founder Herb Alpert. &quot;Hang Time&quot; was released in 1988, followed by &quot;And the Horse They Rode In On&quot; in 1990 (produced by X-pensive Winos drummer Steve Jordan). Because of poor sales and Pirner&#x27;s hearing problems, the group considered disbanding.

After playing a series of acoustic shows in the early 1990s, they were picked up by Columbia Records. In 1992 they released &quot;Grave Dancers Union&quot;, which became their most popular album. On January 20, 1993, the group performed at the first inauguration of United States President Bill Clinton. Later that year, the band performed &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; for the AIDS benefit album &quot;No Alternative&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization. The band added keyboard player Joey Huffman in the summer of 1993. He toured with the band until joining Matchbox Twenty in 1998. Huffman played on the albums &quot;Let Your Dim Light Shine&quot;, &quot;After the Flood: Live from the Grand Forks Prom, June 28, 1997&quot;, and &quot;The Silver Lining&quot;. Soul Asylum won the 1994 Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for &quot;Runaway Train&quot;. The music video for that song featured photographs and names of missing children, in the style of a public service announcement. At the end of the video, Pirner appeared and said, &quot;If you&#x27;ve seen one of these kids, or you are one of them, please call this number&quot;, and then the telephone number of a missing children&#x27;s help line was shown. For use outside the U.S., the video was edited to include photos and names of missing children from the area where the video would be shown. The video was instrumental in reuniting several children with their families.

Before their next studio album, drummer Grant Young was fired and was replaced by Sterling Campbell. Campbell had been credited as providing percussion on &quot;Grave Dancers Union&quot; (although he had actually done at least half of the drumming on that album). The next release, &quot;Let Your Dim Light Shine&quot;, included the track &quot;Misery&quot;, which reached the Top 20, but the album was not as successful as the band&#x27;s previous one. In 1997 Soul Asylum performed a benefit concert for North Dakota students whose prom had been cancelled because of the Red River Flood of 1997. Some of the songs played during the prom were later released on &quot;After the Flood: Live from the Grand Forks Prom, June 28, 1997&quot; in 2004. The group released &quot;Candy from a Stranger&quot; the following year. The album was unsuccessful, and the band was dropped by Columbia Records. Pirner said, &quot;It&#x27;s sort of sad to say, but you could see the whole grunge-rock-band thing getting totally over-saturated and people were looking for something new.&quot; The band took a step back; Pirner explained, &quot;We needed to reassess how far we&#x27;ve gone and how much further we&#x27;re going to go and which way we want to go and what we do right and what we do wrong. It was kind of time to take inventory.&quot;

===2000s===
Pirner became friends with the film director Kevin Smith, a longtime Soul Asylum fan. Soul Asylum contributed music to three Kevin Smith films, &quot;Clerks&quot;, &quot;Clerks II&quot;, and 1997&#x27;s &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; (in which Pirner provided the score). Smith directed the music video for the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Even Tell,&quot; which was featured on the &quot;Clerks&quot; soundtrack.

In May 2004, bassist Mueller was diagnosed with throat cancer and underwent treatment. In October 2004, a benefit concert was held for him in Minneapolis at The Quest nightclub, featuring popular local groups and musicians, including Soul Asylum, the Gear Daddies, Paul Westerberg, and former Hüsker Dü bandmates Bob Mould and Grant Hart, who reunited for their first performance together in sixteen years. The benefit raised over $50,000. At the time, Mueller&#x27;s cancer was in remission, and he played with his bandmates during the show. Mueller later recorded his last Soul Asylum album, &quot;The Silver Lining&quot;. However, the cancer returned, and he died at his home on June 17, 2005. Soul Asylum released &quot;The Silver Lining&quot; on July 11, 2006, their first album of new material since &quot;Candy from a Stranger&quot;, released eight years earlier.
In late 2005, ex-Replacements bassist (and former Guns N&#x27; Roses bassist) Tommy Stinson and former Prince drummer Michael Bland joined Soul Asylum. The band completed its American tour in support of &quot;The Silver Lining&quot; in late 2006. In November and December 2006 they opened for Cheap Trick on that band&#x27;s American tour. On March 10, 2007, Soul Asylum joined Cyndi Lauper, Mint Condition, and Lifehouse in a concert to benefit Wain McFarlane, the leader of the reggae band Ipso Facto, to help pay for the expenses of a kidney transplant.

=== 2010s &amp; 2020s ===
Stinson was a permanent member until 2012, but in 2006 and 2007, while he was on tour with Guns N&#x27; Roses, his place was temporarily filled by George Scot McKelvey. During the 2010 Guns N&#x27; Roses world tour, his fill-in was Pete Donnelly. Soul Asylum released the album &quot;Delayed Reaction&quot; in 2012.

On October 9, 2012, guitarist Dan Murphy retired from Soul Asylum to focus on his private life.

In November 2012, Winston Roye replaced Tommy Stinson on bass and Justin Sharbono replaced Dan Murphy on guitar. In 2016, Ryan Smith replaced Sharbono.

In 2014, Karl Mueller&#x27;s widow Mary Beth founded the nonprofit Kill Kancer in Karl&#x27;s memory to help continue the fight against cancer. 

The band&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;Hurry Up and Wait&quot;, was released on April 17, 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic interrupted the 2020 tour in support of &quot;Hurry Up and Wait&quot; with a final performance at the Teragram Ballroom in Los Angeles on March 11, 2020. Pirner and Smith instead hosted frequent &quot;live&quot; performances during the 2020 shutdown via Facebook and Instagram.

Soul Asylum returned to the stage on June 26, 2021 performing in New Lenox, Illinois as the opening act for the Bodeans.

In March 2023, through Kill Kancer, singer Dave Pirner and bassist Jeremy Tappero met with Alex Etheridge, a 13-year-old Phoenix musician suffering from bone cancer, at Flowers Studio in Minneapolis. Flowers was founded by musician Ed Ackerson, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2019; Ackerson&#x27;s widow Ashley donated the studio time to Alex. The trio recorded Alex&#x27;s song &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;. The song is about how Alex&#x27;s thoughts of returning home helped him deal with being in the hospital. It was largely written by Alex himself, who had worked out the drums parts, lyrics, and main guitar riff before meeting with Soul Asylum. He and the band spent four hours in the studio working on the song, which was later released on SoundCloud. Alex died on July 19, 2023.

In June 2024, the band released a new single &quot;Trial By Fire,” followed by “High Road” on July 17 from their upcoming thirteenth studio album, &quot;Slowly but Shirley&quot;, set to be released in the fall.

==Musical style==
The band have been described musically as alternative rock, grunge, country rock, punk rock, pop rock, post-grunge, and indie rock.

==Honors and awards==

The band has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,&quot; according to journalist Steve Marsh.

<text>Newcastle University (legally the University of Newcastle upon Tyne) is a public research university based in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. It has overseas campuses in Singapore and Malaysia. The university is a red brick university and a member of the Russell Group, an association of research-intensive UK universities.

The university&#x27;s history began with the School of Medicine and Surgery (later the College of Medicine), established in Newcastle in 1834, and the College of Physical Science (later renamed Armstrong College), founded in 1871. These two colleges came to form the larger division of the federal University of Durham, with the Durham Colleges forming the other. The Newcastle colleges merged to form King&#x27;s College in 1937. In 1963, following an Act of Parliament, King&#x27;s College became the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.

The university is subdivided into three faculties: the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences; the Faculty of Medical Sciences; and the Faculty of Science, Agriculture and Engineering. The university offers over 200 full-time undergraduate degree programmes and over 300 postgraduate taught and research programmes across a range of disciplines. The annual income of the institution for 2023–24 was £619.8 million of which £126.1 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £475 million.

==History==
The establishment of a university in Newcastle upon Tyne was first proposed in 1831 by Thomas Greenhow in a lecture to the Literary and Philosophical Society. In 1832 a group of local medics – physicians George Fife (teaching &quot;materia medica&quot; and therapeutics) and Samuel Knott (teaching theory and practice of medicine), and surgeons John Fife (teaching surgery), Alexander Fraser (teaching anatomy and physiology) and Henry Glassford Potter (teaching chemistry) – started offering medical lectures in Bell&#x27;s Court to supplement the apprenticeship system (a fourth surgeon, Duncan McAllum, is mentioned by some sources among the founders, but was not included in the prospectus). The first session started on 1 October 1832 with eight or nine students, including John Snow, then apprenticed to a local surgeon-apothecary, the opening lecture being delivered by John Fife. In 1834 the lectures and practical demonstrations moved to the Hall of the Company of Barber Surgeons to accommodate the growing number of students, and the School of Medicine and Surgery was formally established on 1 October 1834.

On 25 June 1851, following a dispute among the teaching staff, the school was formally dissolved and the lecturers split into two rival institutions. The majority formed the Newcastle College of Medicine, and the others established themselves as the Newcastle upon Tyne College of Medicine and Practical Science with competing lecture courses. In July 1851 the majority college was recognised by the Society of Apothecaries and in October by the Royal College of Surgeons of England and in January 1852 was approved by the University of London to submit its students for London medical degree examinations. Later in 1852, the majority college was formally linked to the University of Durham, becoming the &quot;Newcastle-upon-Tyne College of Medicine in connection with the University of Durham&quot;. The college awarded its first &#x27;Licence in Medicine&#x27; (LicMed) under the auspices of the University of Durham in 1856, with external examiners from Oxford and London, becoming the first medical examining body in the United Kingdom to institute practical examinations alongside written and &quot;viva voce&quot; examinations. The two colleges amalgamated in 1857, with the first session of the unified college opening on 3 October that year. In 1861 the degree of Master of Surgery was introduced, allowing for the double qualification of Licence of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery, along with the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Doctor of Medicine, both of which required residence in Durham. In 1870 the college was brought into closer connection with the university, becoming the &quot;Durham University College of Medicine&quot; with the Reader in Medicine becoming the Professor of Medicine, the college gaining a representative on the university&#x27;s senate, and residence at the college henceforth counting as residence in the university towards degrees in medicine and surgery, removing the need for students to spend a period of residence in Durham before they could receive the higher degrees.

Attempts to realise a place for the teaching of sciences in the city were finally met with the foundation of the College of Physical Science in 1871. The college offered instruction in mathematics, physics, chemistry and geology to meet the growing needs of the mining industry, becoming the &quot;Durham College of Physical Science&quot; in 1883 and then renamed after William George Armstrong as &quot;Armstrong College&quot; in 1904. Both of these institutions were part of the University of Durham, which became a federal university under the Durham University Act 1908 with two divisions in Durham and Newcastle. By 1908, the Newcastle division was teaching a full range of subjects in the Faculties of Medicine, Arts, and Science, which also included agriculture and engineering.

Throughout the early 20th century, the medical and science colleges outpaced the growth of their Durham counterparts. Following tensions between the two Newcastle colleges in the early 1930s, a Royal Commission in 1934 recommended the merger of the two colleges to form &quot;King&#x27;s College, Durham&quot;; that was effected by the Durham University Act 1937. Further growth of both division of the federal university led to tensions within the structure and a feeling that it was too large to manage as a single body. On 1 August 1963 the Universities of Durham and Newcastle upon Tyne Act 1963 separated the two thus creating the &quot;University of Newcastle upon Tyne&quot;. As the successor of King&#x27;s College, Durham, the university at its founding in 1963, adopted the coat of arms originally granted to the Council of King&#x27;s College in 1937.

Above the portico of the Students&#x27; Union building are bas-relief carvings of the arms and mottoes of the University of Durham, Armstrong College and Durham University College of Medicine, the predecessor parts of Newcastle University. While a Latin motto, (&quot;mind moves matter&quot;) appears in the Students&#x27; Union building, the university itself does not have an official motto.

In 1967, Newcastle became the only British university to confer an honorary degree on Martin Luther King.

The university established a branch campus in London in 2015, in partnership with INTO University Partnerships, at INTO&#x27;s existing London campus. The London campus was closed in 2021.

In 2024, Newcastle University had a drop in income of £35 million, referred to as a crisis by the local branch of the Universities and Colleges Union (UCU). The university had already made £15 million of savings in its budget for the year, but this left a deficit of £20 million. As a result, academic promotions were cancelled and the university announced a voluntary redundancy scheme. The UCU held a consultative ballot of members on possible strike action related to the cuts in November 2024.

==Campus and location==

===United Kingdom===

The university occupies a campus site close to Haymarket in central Newcastle upon Tyne. It is located to the northwest of the city centre between the open spaces of Leazes Park and the Town Moor; the university medical school and Royal Victoria Infirmary are adjacent to the west.

The Armstrong building is the oldest building on the campus and is the site of the original Armstrong College. The building was constructed in three stages; the north east wing was completed first at a cost of £18,000 and opened by Princess Louise on 5 November 1888. The south-east wing, which includes the Jubilee Tower, and south-west wings were opened in 1894. The Jubilee Tower was built with surplus funds raised from an Exhibition to mark Queen Victoria&#x27;s Jubilee in 1887. The north-west front, forming the main entrance, was completed in 1906 and features two stone figures to represent science and the arts. Much of the later construction work was financed by Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell, the metallurgist and former Lord Mayor of Newcastle, after whom the main tower is named. In 1906 it was opened by King Edward VII.

The building contains the &quot;King&#x27;s Hall&quot;, which serves as the university&#x27;s chief hall for ceremonial purposes where Congregation ceremonies are held. It can contain 500 seats. King Edward VII gave permission to call the Great Hall, King&#x27;s Hall. During the First World War, the building was requisitioned by the War Office to create the first Northern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. Graduation photographs are often taken in the University Quadrangle, next to the Armstrong building. In 1949 the Quadrangle was turned into a formal garden in memory of members of Newcastle University who gave their lives in the two World Wars. In 2017, a statue of Martin Luther King Jr. was erected in the inner courtyard of the Armstrong Building, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his honorary degree from the university.

The Bruce Building is a former brewery, constructed between 1896 and 1900 on the site of the Hotspur Hotel, and designed by the architect Joseph Oswald as the new premises of Newcastle Breweries Limited. The university occupied the building from the 1950s, but, having been empty for some time, the building was refurbished in 2016 to become residential and office space.

The Devonshire Building, opened in 2004, incorporates in an energy efficient design. It uses photovoltaic cells to help to power motorised shades that control the temperature of the building and geothermal heating coils. Its architects won awards in the Hadrian awards and the RICS Building of the Year Award 2004. The university won a Green Gown Award for its construction.
Plans for additions and improvements to the campus were made public in March 2008 and completed in 2010 at a cost of £200 million. They included a redevelopment of the south-east (Haymarket) façade with a five-storey King&#x27;s Gate administration building as well as new student accommodation. Two additional buildings for the school of medicine were also built.
September 2012 saw the completion of the new buildings and facilities for INTO Newcastle University on the university campus. The main building provides 18 new teaching rooms, a Learning Resource Centre, a lecture theatre, science lab, administrative and academic offices and restaurant.

The Philip Robinson Library is the main university library and is named after a bookseller in the city and benefactor to the library. The Walton Library specialises in services for the Faculty of Medical Sciences in the Medical School. It is named after Lord Walton of Detchant, former Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Professor of Neurology. The library has a relationship with the Northern region of the NHS allowing their staff to use the library for research and study. The Law Library specialises in resources relating to law, and the Marjorie Robinson Library Rooms offers additional study spaces and computers. Together, these house over one million books and 500,000 electronic resources. Some schools within the university, such as the School of Modern Languages, also have their own smaller libraries with smaller highly specialised collections.

In addition to the city centre campus there are buildings such as the Dove Marine Laboratory located on Cullercoats Bay, and Cockle Park Farm in Northumberland.

===International===
In September 2008, the university&#x27;s first overseas branch was opened in Singapore, a Marine International campus called, NUMI Singapore. This later expanded beyond marine subjects and became Newcastle University Singapore, largely through becoming an Overseas University Partner of Singapore Institute of Technology.

In 2011, the university&#x27;s Medical School opened an international branch campus in Iskandar Puteri, Johor, Malaysia, namely Newcastle University Medicine Malaysia.

===Student accommodation===
Newcastle University has many catered and non-catered halls of residence available to first-year students, located around the city of Newcastle. Popular Newcastle areas for private student houses and flats off campus include Jesmond, Heaton, Sandyford, Shieldfield, South Shields and Spital Tongues.

Henderson Hall was used as a hall of residence until a fire destroyed it in 2023.

St Mary&#x27;s College in Fenham, one of the halls of residence, was formerly St Mary&#x27;s College of Education, a teacher training college.

==Organisation and governance==
The current Chancellor is the British poet and artist Imtiaz Dharker. She assumed the position of Chancellor on 1 January 2020. The vice-chancellor is Chris Day, a hepatologist and former pro-vice-chancellor of the Faculty of Medical Sciences.

The university has an enrolment of some 16,000 undergraduate and 5,600 postgraduate students. Teaching and research are delivered in 19 academic schools, 13 research institutes and 38 research centres, spread across three Faculties: the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences; the Faculty of Medical Sciences; and the Faculty of Science, Agriculture and Engineering. The university offers around 175 full-time undergraduate degree programmes in a wide range of subject areas spanning arts, sciences, engineering and medicine, together with approximately 340 postgraduate taught and research programmes across a range of disciplines.

It holds a series of public lectures called &#x27;Insights&#x27; each year in the Curtis Auditorium in the Herschel Building. Many of the university&#x27;s partnerships with companies, like Red Hat, are housed in the Herschel Annex.

In 2012, the university opened the Newcastle Institute for Social Renewal to address issues of social and economic change, representing the research-led academic schools across the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences and the Business School.

Mark Shucksmith was Director of the Newcastle Institute for Social Renewal (NISR) at Newcastle University, where he is also Professor of Planning.

In 2006, the university was granted fair trade status and from January 2007 it became a smoke-free campus.

The university has also been actively involved with several of the region&#x27;s museums for many years. The Great North Museum: Hancock originally opened in 1884 and is often a venue for the university&#x27;s events programme.

The Economics Department is currently headed by the Sir David Dale Chair. Among the eminent economists having served in the Department (both as holders of the Sir David Dale Chair) are Harry Mainwaring Hallsworth and Stanley Dennison.

==== Business School ====
Like its peers in the north of England, such as the business schools of University of Bradford and Manchester Metropolitan University, Newcastle University Business School is a triple accredited business school, with accreditation by the three major accreditation bodies: AACSB, AMBA and EQUIS. 

In 2002, Newcastle University Business School established the Business Accounting and Finance or &#x27;Flying Start&#x27; degree in association with the ICAEW and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The course offers an accelerated route towards the ACA Chartered Accountancy qualification and is the Business School&#x27;s Flagship programme.

In 2011 the business school opened their new building built on the former Scottish and Newcastle brewery site next to St James&#x27; Park. This building was officially opened on 19 March 2012 by Lord Burns.

The business school operated a central London campus from 2014 to 2021, in partnership with INTO University Partnerships until 2020.

====Medical School====
The BMC Medicine journal reported in 2008 that medical graduates from Oxford, Cambridge and Newcastle performed better in postgraduate tests than any other medical school in the UK.

In 2008 the Medical School announced that they were expanding their campus to Malaysia.

The Royal Victoria Infirmary has always had close links with the Faculty of Medical Sciences as a major teaching hospital.

====School of Modern Languages====
The School of Modern Languages consists of five sections: East Asian (which includes Japanese and Chinese); French; German; Spanish, Portuguese &amp; Latin American Studies; and Translating &amp; Interpreting Studies. Six languages are taught from beginner&#x27;s level to full degree level ‒ Chinese, Japanese, French, German, Spanish and Portuguese ‒ and beginner&#x27;s courses in Catalan, Dutch, Italian and Quechua are also available. Beyond the learning of the languages themselves, Newcastle also places a great deal of emphasis on study and experience of the cultures of the countries where the languages taught are spoken. The School of Modern Languages hosts North East England&#x27;s only branches of two internationally important institutes: the Camões Institute, a language institute for Portuguese, and the Confucius Institute, a language and cultural institute for Chinese.

The teaching of modern foreign languages at Newcastle predates the creation of Newcastle University itself, as in 1911 Armstrong College in Newcastle installed Albert George Latham, its first professor of modern languages.

The School of Modern Languages at Newcastle is the lead institution in the North East Routes into Languages Consortium and, together with the Durham University, Northumbria University, the University of Sunderland, the Teesside University and a network of schools, undertakes work activities of discovery of languages for the 9 to 13 years pupils. This implies having festivals, Q&amp;A sessions, language tasters, or quizzes organised, as well as a web learning work aiming at constructing a web portal to link language learners across the region.

====Newcastle Law School====

Newcastle Law School is the longest established law school in the north-east of England when law was taught at the university&#x27;s predecessor college before it became independent from Durham University. It has a number of recognised international and national experts in a variety of areas of legal scholarship ranging from Common and Chancery law, to International and European law, as well as contextual, socio-legal and theoretical legal studies.

The Law School occupies four specially adapted late-Victorian town houses. The Staff Offices, the Alumni Lecture Theatre and seminar rooms as well as the Law Library are all located within the School buildings.

====School of Computing====
The School of Computing was ranked in the Times Higher Education world Top 100. Research areas include Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and ubiquitous computing, secure and resilient systems, synthetic biology, scalable computing (high performance systems, data science, machine learning and data visualization), and advanced modelling. The school led the formation of the National Innovation Centre for Data. Innovative teaching in the School was recognised in 2017 with the award of a National Teaching Fellowship.

===Cavitation tunnel===

Newcastle University has the second largest cavitation tunnel in the UK. Founded in 1950, and based in the Marine Science and Technology Department, the Emerson Cavitation Tunnel is used as a test basin for propellers, water turbines, underwater coatings and interaction of propellers with ice. The Emerson Cavitation Tunnel was recently relocated to a new facility in Blyth.

===Museums and galleries===
The university is associated with a number of the region&#x27;s museums and galleries, including the Great North Museum project, which is primarily based at the world-renowned Hancock Museum. The Great North Museum: Hancock also contains the collections from two of the university&#x27;s former museums, the Shefton Museum and the Museum of Antiquities, both now closed. The university&#x27;s Hatton Gallery is also a part of the Great North Museum project, and remains within the Fine Art Building.

===Finances===

In the financial year ending 31 July 2024, Newcastle had a total income of £619.8 billion (2022/23 – £592.4 million) and total expenditure of £475 million (2022/23 – £558 million). Key sources of income included £307.4 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 – £286.2 million), £88.7 million from funding body grants (2022/23 – £88.9 million), £126.1 million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 – £119.3 million), £9.8 million from investment income (2022/23 – £6 million) and £7.6 million from donations and endowments (2022/23 – £11 million).

At year end, Newcastle had endowments of £94.8 million (2023 – £87.1 million) and total net assets of £627.2 million (2023 – £474.9 million). It holds the sixteenth-largest endowment of any university in the UK.

Due to a decline in the intake of international students as of 2025, the university is undergoing 300 full-time job cuts to recover from a £35 million shortfall. Since 20 January 2025, the university heads have proposed a &quot;voluntary severance scheme&quot; to allow staff to voluntarily leave their jobs, but they will not rule out forced job losses if the scheme does not reach their goal. Staff voted to take part in industrial strike action to oppose the cuts.

==Student life==

===Students&#x27; union===
Newcastle University Students&#x27; Union (NUSU), known as the Union Society until a 2012 rebranding, includes student-run sports clubs and societies.

The Union building was built in 1924 following a generous gift from an anonymous donor, who is now believed to have been Sir Cecil Cochrane, a major benefactor to the university. It is built in the neo-Jacobean style and was designed by the local architect Robert Burns Dick. It was opened on 22 October 1925 by the Rt. Hon. Lord Eustace Percy, who later served as Rector of King&#x27;s College from 1937 to 1952. It is a Grade II listed building. In 2010, the university donated £8 million towards a redevelopment project for the Union Building.

The Students&#x27; Union is run by seven paid sabbatical officers, including a Welfare and Equality Officer, and ten part-time unpaid officer positions. The former leader of the Liberal Democrats Tim Farron was President of NUSU in 1991–1992. The Students&#x27; Union also employs around 300 people in ancillary roles including bar staff and entertainment organisers.

<doc id="203344" wikidata="Q460178" url="?curid=203344" title="GmbH">
<text> (; ) is a type of legal entity in German-speaking countries. It is equivalent to a (Sàrl) in the French-speaking part of Switzerland and to a (Sagl) in the Italian-speaking part.

It is an entity broadly equivalent to the private limited company in the United Kingdom and many Commonwealth countries, and the limited liability company (LLC) in the United States. The name of the GmbH form emphasizes that the owners (, also known as members) of the entity are not personally liable for the company&#x27;s debts. GmbHs are considered legal persons under German, Swiss and Austrian law. Other variations include mbH (used when the term is part of the company name itself), and gGmbH () for non-profit companies.

The GmbH has become the most common corporation form in Germany because the AG (), the other major company form corresponding to a stock corporation, was much more complicated to form and operate until recently.

==Requirements of formation==
A GmbH is formed in three stages: the founding association, which is regarded as a private partnership with full liability of the founding partners/members; the founded company (often styled as &quot;GmbH i.G.&quot;, with &quot;i.G.&quot; standing for – literally &quot;in the founding stages&quot;, with the meaning of &quot;registration pending&quot;); and finally the fully registered GmbH. Only the registration of the company in the Commercial Register () provides the GmbH with its full legal status.

The founding act and the articles of association have to be notarized, as do a number of business transactions, such as transfer of shares, issuing of stock, and amendments to the articles of association. Many of those documents have to be filed with the company registry, where they are checked by special judges or other judicial officers. This can be a tiresome and time-consuming process, as in most cases the transactions are legally valid only when filed with the registry. The founding process is expensive. Normally the foundation of a new GmbH costs about €1000 to €3000. The GmbH law outlines the minimum content of the articles of association, but it is quite common to have a wide range of additional rules in the articles.

Under German law, the GmbH must have a minimum founding capital of €25,000 (§ 5 I GmbHG), of which €12,500 has to be raised before registering in the commercial register (§ 7 II GmbHG). A supervisory board () is required if the company has more than 500 employees; otherwise, the company is run only by the managing directors () who have the unrestricted proxy for the company. The members acting collectively may restrict the powers of the managing directors by giving them binding orders. In most cases, the articles of the association list the business activities for which the directors obtain prior consent from the members. Under German law, a violation of these duties by a managing director will not invalidate a contract with a third party, but the GmbH may hold the managing director in question liable for damages.

Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein have different national requirements as follows:

==History==
The concept of a company with limited liability existed in the United Kingdom before it did in German-speaking countries. In 1892, the laws governing the GmbH were adopted in Germany, and in Austria in 1906. 
During the 19th century, a legal entity with liability limited to the contributed capital was regarded as something dangerous. Hence, German law has many restrictions unknown to common law systems.

Because there is no central company registry in Germany but rather several hundred connected to regional courts, administration of the law can vary somewhat between German states. Since 2007, there has been an internet-based central company register for Germany, called the .

In 2008, a derived form called (), or in short , was introduced. It requires a minimum founding capital of €1 and was introduced to assist company founders in setting up a new company. The UG must enlarge its capital by at least 25% of its annual net profit (with some adjustments), until the general minimum of €25,000 is reached (at which point the company may change its name to the more prestigious &quot;GmbH&quot;).
A (gGmbH) is a special form of a limited liability company with a charitable purpose. Traditional foundations and gGmbHs in Germany do not have minimum annual giving requirements. They are required to spend any profits by the end of the fiscal year in which they were accrued, but are allowed to build capital reserves totaling 10 percent of annual donations or 33 percent of dividends received.

This is most commonly followed by 2.d4 d5. Black usually plays ...c5 soon after, attacking White&#x27;s and gaining on the . The French has a reputation for solidity and resilience, although some lines such as the Winawer Variation can lead to complications. Black&#x27;s position is often somewhat in the early game; in particular, the pawn on e6 can impede the of the bishop on c8.

Following the opening moves 1.e4 e6, the main line of the French Defence continues 2.d4 d5 (see below for alternatives). White sets up a , which Black immediately challenges by attacking the pawn on e4. The same position can be reached by transposition from a Queen&#x27;s Pawn Game after 1.d4 e6 2.e4 d5 or the declining of a Blackmar–Diemer Gambit after 1.d4 d5 2.e4 e6.

White&#x27;s options include defending the e4-pawn with 3.Nc3 or 3.Nd2, advancing it with 3.e5, or exchanging it with 3.exd5, each of which leads to different types of positions. Defending the pawn with 3.Bd3 allows 3...dxe4 4.Bxe4 Nf6, when Black gains either a tempo or the advantage of .

==General themes==
The diagram shows a pawn structure commonly found in the French. Black has more space on the queenside, so tends to focus on that side of the board, almost always playing ...c7–c5 early on to attack White&#x27;s pawn chain at its base, and may follow up by advancing the a- and b-pawns.

Alternatively or simultaneously, Black will play against White&#x27;s centre, which is cramping Black&#x27;s position. In the unlikely case that the flank attack ...c7–c5 is insufficient to achieve counterplay, Black can also try ...f7–f6. In many positions, White may support the pawn on e5 by playing f2–f4, with ideas of f4–f5, but the primary drawback to the advance of the f-pawn is opening of the g1–a7 diagonal, which is particularly significant due to the black queen&#x27;s oft-found position on b6 and the heavy pressure on d4. In addition, many French Advance lines do not provide White with the time to play f2–f4 as it does not support the heavily pressured d4-pawn. For instance, 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.f4? (if White plays Nf3, f4 will come much slower) 5...Qb6 6.Nf3 Nh6! and the knight will go to f5 to place fatal pressure on d4 and dxc5 will never be an option as the white king would be stuck in the centre of the board after ...Bxc5.
White usually tries to exploit the extra space on the , often playing for a mating attack. White tries to do this in the Alekhine–Chatard Attack, for example. Another example is the following line of the Classical French: 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.e5 Nfd7 6.Bxe7 Qxe7 7.f4 0-0 8.Nf3 c5 9.Bd3 (). White&#x27;s eyes the weak h7-pawn, which is usually defended by a knight on f6, but here it has been pushed away by e5. If 9...cxd4 (Black does better with 9...f5 or 9...f6), White can play the Greek gift sacrifice 10.Bxh7+ Kxh7 11.Ng5+ Qxg5 12.fxg5 dxc3 13.Qh5+! where Black has three minor pieces for the queen, a slight material superiority, but has a vulnerable king and White has good attacking chances.

Apart from a piece attack, White may play for the advance of the kingside pawns (an especially common idea in the endgame), which usually involves f2–f4, g2–g4 and then f4–f5 to use the spatial advantage on that side of the board. A white pawn on f5 can be very strong as it may threaten to capture on e6 or advance to f6. Sometimes the h-pawn to h5 or h6 may also be effective. A modern idea is for White to gain space on the queenside by playing a2–a3 and b2–b4. If implemented successfully, this will further restrict Black&#x27;s pieces.
One of the drawbacks of the French Defence for Black is the , which is blocked in by the pawn on e6 and can remain passive throughout the game. An often-cited example of the potential weakness of this bishop is S. Tarrasch–R. Teichmann, San Sebastián 1912, in which the diagrammed position was reached after fifteen moves of a Classical French.

Black&#x27;s position is passive because the light-square bishop is hemmed in by pawns on a6, b5, d5, e6 and f7. White will probably try to exchange Black&#x27;s knight, which is the only one of Black&#x27;s pieces that has any scope. Although it might be possible for Black to hold on for a draw, it is not easy and, barring any mistakes by White, Black will have few chances to create counterplay; this is why, for many years, the classical lines fell out of favour, and 3...Bb4 began to be seen more frequently after World War I, owing to the efforts of Nimzowitsch and Botvinnik. In Tarrasch–Teichmann, White won after 41 moves. In order to avoid this fate, Black usually makes it a priority early in the game to find a useful post for the bishop. Black can play ...Bd7–a4 to attack a pawn on c2, which occurs in many lines of the Winawer Variation. If Black&#x27;s f-pawn has moved to f6, then Black may also consider bringing the bishop to g6 or h5 via d7 and e8. If White&#x27;s light-square bishop is on the f1–a6 diagonal, Black can try to exchange it by playing ...b6 and ...Ba6, or ...Qb6 followed by ...Bd7–b5.

==Main line: 2.d4 d5 ==

===3.Nc3===
Played in over 40% of all games after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5, 3.Nc3 is the most commonly seen line against the French. Black has three main options, 3...Bb4 (the Winawer Variation), 3...Nf6 (the Classical Variation), and 3...dxe4 (the Rubinstein Variation). An eccentric idea is 3...Nc6 4.Nf3 Nf6 with the idea of 5.e5 Ne4; German IM Helmut Reefschlaeger has been fond of this move. It is incredibly dense in theory.

====Winawer Variation: 3...Bb4 ====
This variation, named after Szymon Winawer and pioneered by Nimzowitsch and Botvinnik, is one of the main systems in the French, due chiefly to the latter&#x27;s efforts in the 1940s, becoming the most often seen rejoinder to 3.Nc3, though in the 1980s, the Classical Variation with 3...Nf6 began a revival, and has since become more popular.
3...Bb4 pins the knight on c3, forcing White to resolve the central tension. White normally clarifies the central situation for the moment with 4.e5, gaining space and hoping to show that Black&#x27;s b4-bishop is misplaced. The main line then is: 4...c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3, resulting in the diagrammed position.

While White has doubled pawns on the queenside, which form the basis for Black&#x27;s counterplay, they can also help White since they strengthen his centre and give him a semi-open b-file. White has a spatial advantage on the kingside, where Black is even weaker than usual because he has traded off his . Combined with the bishop pair, this gives White attacking chances, which he must attempt to use as the long-term features of this pawn structure favour Black.

In the diagrammed position, Black most frequently plays 6...Ne7 (The main alternative is 6...Qc7, which can simply transpose to main lines after 7.Qg4 Ne7, but Black also has the option of 7.Qg4 f5 or ...f6. 6...Qa5 has recently become a popular alternative). Now White can exploit the absence of Black&#x27;s dark-square bishop by playing 7.Qg4, giving Black two choices: he may sacrifice his kingside pawns with 7...Qc7 8.Qxg7 Rg8 9.Qxh7 cxd4 but destroy White&#x27;s centre in return, the so-called &quot;Poisoned Pawn Variation&quot;; or he can play 7...0-0 8.Bd3 Nbc6, which avoids giving up material, but leaves the king on the flank where White is trying to attack. A more recent alternative is 7...Kf8, which tries to make use of the locked pawn centre (the king is safe from central attacks, and can run away from a kingside attack). Experts on the 7.Qg4 line include Judit Polgár.

If the tactical complications of 7.Qg4 are not to White&#x27;s taste, 7.Nf3 and 7.a4 are good positional alternatives, and 7.h4 is a more aggressive attempt:

7.Nf3 is a natural developing move, and White usually follows it up by developing the king&#x27;s bishop to d3 or e2 (occasionally to b5) and castling kingside. This is called the Winawer Advance Variation. This line often continues 7...Bd7 8.Bd3 c4 9.Be2 Ba4 10.0-0 Qa5 11.Bd2 Nbc6 12.Ng5 h6 13.Nh3 0-0-0. Its assessment is unclear, but most likely Black would be considered &quot;comfortable&quot; here.

The purpose behind 7.a4 is threefold: it prepares Bc1–a3, taking advantage of the absence of Black&#x27;s dark-square bishop. It also prevents Black from playing ...Qa5–a4 or ...Bd7–a4 attacking c2, and if Black plays ...b6 (followed by ...Ba6 to trade off the bad bishop), White may play a5 to attack the b6-pawn. World Champions Vasily Smyslov and Bobby Fischer both used this line with success.

White also has 7.h4, which has the ideas of either pushing this pawn to h6 to cause more dark-square weaknesses in the Black kingside (if Black meets h5 with ...h6, White can play g4–g5), or getting the rook into the game via Rh3–g3.

Black can also gain attacking chances in most lines: against 7.Qg4, Black will attack White&#x27;s king in the centre; whereas against the other lines, Black can often gain an attack with ...0-0-0, normally combined with ...c4 to close the queenside, and then ...f6 to open up the kingside, where White&#x27;s king often resides. If Black can accomplish this, White is often left without meaningful play, although ...c4 does permit White a4 followed by Ba3 if Black has not stopped this by placing a piece on a4 (for example, by Bd7–a4).

=====Sidelines=====
5th-move deviations for White include:
* 5.Qg4
* 5.dxc5
* 5.Nf3
* 5.Bd2

4th-move deviations for White include:
* 4.exd5 exd5, transposing to a line of the Exchange Variation, where White may aim to prove that Black&#x27;s bishop on b4 is misplaced.
* 4.Ne2 (the Alekhine Gambit) 4...dxe4 5.a3 Be7 (5...Bxc3+ is necessary if Black wants to try to hold the pawn) 6.Nxe4 to prevent Black from doubling his pawns.
* 4.Bd3 defending e4.
* 4.a3 Bxc3+ 5.bxc3 dxe4 6.Qg4, another attempt to exploit Black&#x27;s weakness on g7.
* 4.e5 c5 5.Bd2, again preventing the doubled pawns and making possible 6.Nb5, where the knight may hop into d6 or simply defend d4.
* 4.Bd2 (an old move sometimes played by Rashid Nezhmetdinov, notably against Mikhail Tal)

Deviations for Black include:
* 4...Ne7 although this move usually transposes to the main line.
* 4...b6 followed by ...Ba6, or 4...Qd7 with the idea of meeting 5.Qg4 with 5...f5. However, theory currently prefers White&#x27;s chances in both lines.
* Another popular way for Black to deviate is 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Ba5, the Armenian Variation, as its theory and practice have been much enriched by players from that country, the most notable of whom is Rafael Vaganian. Black maintains the pin on the knight, which White usually tries to break by playing 6.b4 cxb4 7.Qg4 or 7.Nb5 (usually 7.Nb5 bxa3+ 8.c3 Bc7 9.Bxa3 and White has the upper hand).

====Classical Variation: 3...Nf6 ====
This is another major system in the French. This position was seen as so normal so no-one thought about claiming it. White can continue with the following options:

=====4.Bg5=====

White threatens 5.e5, attacking the pinned knight. Black has a number of ways to meet this threat.

======Burn Variation: 4...dxe4 ======
Named after Amos Burn, the Burn Variation is the most common reply at the top level. 4...dxe4 5.Nxe4 and usually there now follows: 5...Be7 6.Bxf6 Bxf6 7.Nf3 Nd7 or 7...0-0, resulting in a position resembling those arising from the Rubinstein Variation. However, here Black has the bishop pair, with greater dynamic chances (although White&#x27;s knight is well placed on e4), so this line is more popular than the Rubinstein and has long been a favourite of Evgeny Bareev. Black can also try 5...Be7 6.Bxf6 gxf6, as played by Alexander Morozevich and Gregory Kaidanov; by following up with ...f5 and ...Bf6, Black obtains active piece play in return for his shattered pawn structure. Another line that resembles the Rubinstein is 5...Nbd7 6.Nf3 Be7 (6...h6 is also tried) 7.Nxf6+ Bxf6.

======4...Be7 5.e5 Nfd7 ======

* 4...Be7 5.e5 Nfd7 used to be the main line, even though the Burn Variation has overtaken it in popularity. The usual continuation is 6.Bxe7 Qxe7 7.f4 0-0 (not 7...c5? 8.Nb5!) 8.Nf3 c5, when White has a number of options, including 9.Bd3, 9.Qd2 and 9.dxc5.
* An alternative for White is the gambit 6.h4, which was devised by Adolf Albin and played by Chatard, but not taken seriously until the game Alekhine–Fahrni, Mannheim 1914. It is known today as the Albin–Chatard Attack or the Alekhine–Chatard Attack. After 6...Bxg5 7.hxg5 Qxg5 8.Nh3 Qe7 9.Qg4 g6 10.Ng5 (the reason for 8.Nh3 rather than 8.Nf3 is to play Qg4), White has sacrificed a pawn to keep the black king in the centre, as castling neither queenside nor kingside appears safe. Another point of the gambit is that Black&#x27;s natural French Defence move 6...c5 runs into 7.Bxe7 when Black must either move the king with 7...Kxe7 or allow 7...Qxe7 8.Nb5! with a dual threat of Nc7+, winning the rook on a8, and Nd6+, when Black&#x27;s king must move and the knight is very strong on d6. Black may decline the gambit in several ways such as 6...a6 and 6...h6. After 6...a6, White can continue to play for an attack with the aggressive 7.Qg4! threatening Bxe7 and then Qxg7. Black is forced to eliminate the bishop with 7...Bxg5 8.hxg5, opening up the h-file. A wild game with unsafe kings is sure to ensue. 6...h6 is a safer declination of the sacrifice, forcing the bishop to trade with 7.Bxe7 Qxe7 after which White may continue to try to attack on the kingside in anticipation of Black castling kingside (since queenside castling is undesirable due to the need for c5) with 8.f4 a6 9.g4 with a menacing attack.

======McCutcheon Variation: 4...Bb4 ======
* A third choice for Black is to counterattack with the McCutcheon Variation. In this variation, the second player ignores White&#x27;s threat of e4–e5 and instead plays 4...Bb4. The main line continues: 5.e5 h6 6.Bd2 Bxc3 7.bxc3 Ne4 8.Qg4. At this point Black may play 8...g6, which weakens the kingside dark squares but keeps the option of castling queenside, or 8...Kf8. An alternative way White can treat 5...h6 is to carry through with the threat with 6.exf6 hxg5 7.fxg7 Rg8. The McCutcheon Variation is named for John Lindsay McCutcheon of Philadelphia (1857–1905), who brought the variation to public attention when he used it to defeat World Champion Steinitz in a simultaneous exhibition in Manhattan in 1885. It reached the height of its popularity from 1905 until 1925. After that it disappeared from public eye until it was revived in 1990.

=====Steinitz Variation: 4.e5 =====

Named after Wilhelm Steinitz, the Steinitz Variation continues with 4.e5 Nfd7. Here 5.Nce2, the Shirov–Anand Variation, prepares to bolster the white pawn centre with c2–c3 and f2–f4; while 5.Nf3 transposes to a position also reached via the Two Knights Variation (2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.d4). The main line of the Steinitz is 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3. (Instead 7.Ne2 transposes to the Shirov–Anand Variation, while 7.Be2 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Ndxe5! 9.fxe5 Qh4+ wins a pawn for Black.) Here Black may step up the pressure on d4 by playing 7...Qb6 or 7...cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6, begin queenside play with 7...a6 8.Qd2 b5, or continue kingside development by playing 7...Be7 or 7...cxd4 8.Nxd4 Bc5. Another side-line for 7...cxd4 is 8.Nxd4 Bc5 9. Qd2 Bxd4 10.Bxd4 Nxd4 11. Qxd4 Qb6 12.Qxb6 Nxb6, This line has been referred to as the Vacuum Cleaner Variation. In these lines, White has the option of playing either Qd2 and 0-0-0, or Be2 and 0-0, with the former typically leading to positions due to opposite-side castling when Black castles kingside in both cases.
====Rubinstein Variation: 3...dxe4 ====

This variation is named after Akiba Rubinstein and can also arise from a different move order: 3.Nd2 dxe4. White has freer development and more space in the centre, which Black intends to neutralise by playing ...c7–c5 at some point. This solid line has undergone a modest revival, featuring in many grandmaster (GM) games as a drawing weapon but theory still gives White a slight edge. After 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4, Black has the following options:
* The mainline 4...Nd7 (the most frequent high-level exponent of this variation is Georg Meier). Play might typically proceed 5.Nf3 Ngf6 6.Nxf6+ Nxf6 when Black is ready for ...c5.
* 4...Bd7 5.Nf3 Bc6 (the Fort Knox Variation) activating the light-square bishop, which is often played by Alexander Rustemov.
====Hecht Reefschlager Variation: 3...Nc6 ====
3...Nc6 is the Hecht Reefschlager Variation, a name coined by John Watson. This sideline has been played by Aron Nimzowitsch and many other players.

====Rare sidelines after 3.Nc3====
One rare sideline after 3.Nc3 is 3...c6, which is known as the Paulsen Variation, after Louis Paulsen. It can also be reached via a Caro–Kann Defence move order (1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 e6).

===Tarrasch Variation: 3.Nd2 ===

The Tarrasch Variation is named after Siegbert Tarrasch. This move became particularly popular during the 1970s and early 1980s when Anatoly Karpov used it to great effect. Though less aggressive than the alternate 3.Nc3, it is still used by top-level players seeking a small, safe advantage.

Like 3.Nc3, 3.Nd2 protects e4, but is different in several key respects: it does not block White&#x27;s c-pawn from advancing, which means he can play c3 at some point to support his d4-pawn. Hence, it avoids the Winawer Variation as 3...Bb4 is now readily answered by 4.c3. On the other hand, 3.Nd2 develops the knight to an arguably less active square than 3.Nc3, and in addition, it hems in White&#x27;s dark-square bishop. Hence, White will typically have to spend an extra tempo moving the knight from d2 at some point before developing said bishop.

* 3...c5 4.exd5 and now Black has two ways to recapture:
** 4...exd5 was a staple of many old Karpov–Korchnoi battles, including seven games in their 1974 FIDE Candidates match. It usually leads to Black having an isolated queen&#x27;s pawn (see isolated pawn). The main line continues 5.Ngf3 Nc6 6.Bb5 Bd6 7.0-0 Nge7 8.dxc5 Bxc5 9.Nb3 Bb6 with a position where, if White can neutralise the activity of Black&#x27;s pieces in the middlegame, he will have a slight advantage in the ending. Another possibility for White is 5.Bb5+ Bd7 (5...Nc6 is also possible) 6.Qe2+ Be7 7.dxc5 to trade off the bishops and make it more difficult for Black to regain the pawn.
** 4...Qxd5 is an important alternative for Black; the idea is to trade his c- and d-pawns for White&#x27;s d- and e-pawns, leaving Black with an extra centre pawn. This constitutes a slight structural advantage, but in return White gains time for development by harassing Black&#x27;s queen. This interplay of static and dynamic advantages is the reason why this line has become popular in the last decade. Play usually continues 5.Ngf3 cxd4 6.Bc4 Qd6 7.0-0 Nf6 (preventing 8.Ne4) 8.Nb3 Nc6 9.Nbxd4 Nxd4, and here White may stay in the middlegame with 10.Nxd4 or offer the trade of queens with 10.Qxd4, with the former far more commonly played today.
* 3...Nf6 While the objective of 3...c5 was to break open the centre, 3... Nf6 aims to close it. After 4.e5 Nfd7 5.Bd3 c5 6.c3 Nc6 (6...b6 intends ...Ba6 next to get rid of Black&#x27;s &quot;bad&quot; light-square bishop, a recurring idea in the French) 7.Ne2 (leaving f3 open for the queen&#x27;s knight) 7...cxd4 8.cxd4 f6 9.exf6 Nxf6 10.Nf3 Bd6 Black has freed his pieces at the cost of having a backward pawn on e6. White may also choose to preserve his pawn on e5 by playing 4.e5 Nfd7 5.c3 c5 6.f4 Nc6 7.Ndf3, but his development is slowed as a result, and Black will gain dynamic chances if he can open the position to advantage.
* 3...Nc6 is known as the Guimard Variation: after 4.Ngf3 Nf6 5.e5 Nd7 Black will exchange White&#x27;s cramping e-pawn next move by ...f6. However, Black does not exert any pressure on d4 because he cannot play ...c5, so White should maintain a slight advantage, with 6.Be2 or 6 Nb3.
* 3...Be7 is known as the Morozevich Variation. A fashionable line among top GMs in recent years, this odd-looking move aims to prove that every White move now has its drawbacks, e.g. after 4.Ngf3 Nf6 5.e5 Nfd7 White cannot play f4, whereas 4.Bd3 c5 5.dxc5 Nf6 and 4.e5 c5 5. Qg4 Kf8!? lead to obscure complications. 3...h6, with a similar rationale, has also gained some adventurous followers in recent years, including GM Alexander Morozevich.
* Another rare line is 3...a6, which gained some popularity in the 1970s. Similar to 3...Be7, the idea is to play a waiting move to make White declare his intentions before Black commits to a plan of his own. 3...a6 also controls the b5-square, which is typically useful for Black in most French lines because, for example, White no longer has the option of playing Bb5.

===Advance Variation: 3.e5 ===

The main line of the Advance Variation continues 3...c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 and then we have a branching point:
* 5...Qb6, the idea is to increase the pressure on d4 and eventually undermine the white centre. The queen also attacks the b2-square, so White&#x27;s dark-square bishop cannot easily defend the d4-pawn without losing the b2-pawn. White&#x27;s most common replies are 6.a3, 6.Be2 and 6.Bd3.
** 6.a3 is currently the most important line in the Advance: it prepares 7.b4, gaining space on the queenside. Black may prevent this with 6...c4 intending to take &quot;en passant&quot; if White plays b4, which creates a closed game where Black fights for control of the b3-square. A possible line is 6.a3 c4 7.Nbd2 Na5 8.Rb1 Bd7 and Black has a firm grip on b3 square. Alternatively, Black may continue developing with 6...Nh6, intending ...Nf5, which might seem strange as White can double the pawn with Bxh6, but this is actually considered good for Black. Black plays ...Bg7 and ...0-0 and Black&#x27;s king has adequate defence and White will miss his apparently &#x27;bad&#x27; dark-square bishop.
** 6.Be2 is the other alternative, aiming simply to castle. Once again, a common Black response is 6...Nh6 intending 7...cxd4 8.cxd4 Nf5 attacking d4. White usually responds to this threat with 7.Bxh6 or 7.b3 preparing Bb2.
** 6.Bd3 cxd4 7.cxd4 Bd7 (7...Nxd4 8.Nxd4 Qxd4 9.Bb5+) 8.0-0 Nxd4 9.Nxd4 Qxd4 10.Nc3 is the Milner-Barry Gambit. If Black continues 10...Qxe5, White gains an attack with 11.Re1 Qb8 12.Nxd5 or 11...Qd6 12.Nb5.
* 5...Bd7 was mentioned by Greco as early as 1620. It is known as the Euwe Variation and was popularised by Viktor Korchnoi in the 1970s. Now a main line, the idea behind the move is that since Black usually plays ...Bd7 eventually, he plays it at once and waits for White to show his hand. If White continues 6.a3, modern theory says that Black at least equalises after 6...f6! The lines are complex, but the main point is that a3 is a wasted move if the black queen is not on b6 and so Black uses the extra tempo to attack White&#x27;s centre immediately. Common continuations after 5...Bd7 are 6.Be2 or 6.dxc5 (6.Bb5? is immediately refuted by 6...Nxe5).
* 5...Nh6 has recently become a popular alternative; the idea is that 6.Bxh6 gxh6 gains Black a semi-open g-file to attack the White king, or Black can play ...Bg7 to support ...f6 to attack White&#x27;s pawn on e5. If White doesn&#x27;t take the knight, it will move to f5 to pressure d4, or (after ...f6) to f7 to pressure e5.

There are alternative strategies to 3...c5 that were tried in the early 20th century such as 3...b6, intending to fianchetto the bad bishop and which can transpose to Owen&#x27;s Defence. Also possible is 4...Qb6 5.Nf3 Bd7 intending 6...Bb5 to trade off the &quot;bad&quot; queen&#x27;s bishop. Playing 3...Nc6 is a misguided attempt to reach the Hecht Reefschlager Variation or the Guimard Variation.

===Exchange Variation: 3.exd5 ===

Many players who begin with 1.e4 find that the French Defence is the most difficult opening for them to play against due to the closed structure and unique strategies of the system. Thus, many players choose to play the Exchange so that the position becomes simpler and more clearcut. White makes no effort to exploit the advantage of the first move, and has often chosen this line with expectation of an early draw, and indeed draws often occur if neither side breaks the symmetry. An extreme example was Capablanca–Maróczy, Lake Hopatcong 1926, which went: 4.Bd3 Bd6 5.Nf3 Nf6 6.0-0 0-0 7.Bg5 Bg4 8.Re1 Nbd7 9.Nbd2 c6 10.c3 Qc7 11.Qc2 Rfe8 12.Bh4 Bh5 13.Bg3 Bxg3 14.hxg3 Bg6 15.Rxe8+ Rxe8 16.Bxg6 hxg6 17.Re1 Rxe1+ 18.Nxe1 Ne8 19.Nd3 Nd6 20.Qb3 a6 21.Kf1 .

Despite the symmetrical pawn structure, White cannot force a draw. An obsession with obtaining one sometimes results in embarrassment for White, as in Tatai–Korchnoi, Beer Sheva 1978, which continued 4.Bd3 c5!? 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.Qe2+ Be7 7.dxc5 Nf6 8.h3 0-0 9.0-0 Bxc5 10.c3 Re8 11.Qc2 Qd6 12.Nbd2 Qg3 13.Bf5 Re2 14.Nd4 Nxd4 . A less extreme example was Mikhail Gurevich–Nigel Short, Manila 1990 where White, a strong Russian grandmaster, played openly for the draw but was ground down by Short in 42 moves.

To create genuine winning chances, White will often play c2–c4 at some stage to put pressure on Black&#x27;s d5-pawn. Black can give White an isolated queen&#x27;s pawn by capturing on c4, but this gives White&#x27;s pieces greater freedom, which may lead to attacking chances. This occurs in lines such as 3.exd5 exd5 4.c4 (played by GMs Normunds Miezis and Maurice Ashley) and 4.Nf3 Bd6 5.c4, which may transpose to the Petroff. Conversely, if White declines to do this, Black may play ...c7–c5 himself, e.g. 4.Bd3 c5, as in the above-cited Tatai–Korchnoi game.

If c2–c4 is not played, White and Black have two main piece setups. White may put his pieces on Nf3, Bd3, Bg5 (pinning the black knight), Nc3, Qd2 or the queen&#x27;s knight can go to d2 instead and White can support the centre with c3 and perhaps play Qb3. Conversely, when the queen&#x27;s knight is on c3, the king&#x27;s knight may go to e2 when the enemy bishop and knight can be kept out of the key squares e4 and g4 by f3. When the knight is on c3 in the first and last of the above strategies, White may choose either or . The positions are so symmetrical that the options and strategies are the same for both sides.

Another way to unbalance the position is for White or Black to castle on opposite sides of the board. An example of this is the line 4.Bd3 Nc6 5.c3 Bd6 6.Nf3 Bg4 7.0-0 Nge7 8.Re1 Qd7 9.Nbd2 .

==Early deviations for White==
After 1.e4 e6, the main variation continues 2.d4 d5, but White can try other ideas.

* 2.d3 is usually played with the idea of adopting a King&#x27;s Indian Attack setup after 2...d5 3.Nd2. It has been used by many leading players over the years, including GMs Pal Benko, Bobby Fischer, Leonid Stein and Lev Psakhis. White will likely play Ngf3, g3, Bg2, 0-0, c3 and/or Re1 in some order on the next few moves. Black may combat this setup with 3...c5 followed by ...Nc6, ...Nf6, ...Be7, and ...0-0; developing the kingside by ...Bd6 and ...Nge7 is also playable. 3...Nf6 4.Ngf3 Nc6 plans ...dxe4 and ...e5 to block in the Bg2, and 3...Nf6 4.Ngf3 b6 makes ...Ba6 possible if White&#x27;s light-square bishop leaves the a6–f1 diagonal. Black may defer ...d5, and play 2...c5 and 3...Nc6, developing the kingside by ...g6, ...Bg7, and ...Nge7, or less commonly, by ...Nf6, ...Be7, and (if White&#x27;s knight goes to d2) ...d6.
* 2.f4 is the La Bourdonnais Variation, named after Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais, the 19th-century French master. Play can continue 2...d5 3. e5 c5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5.c3 Nge7 6.Na3 Nf5.
* 2.Qe2 is the Chigorin Variation, which discourages 2...d5 because after 3.exd5 the black pawn is pinned, meaning Black would need to recapture with the queen. Black usually replies 2...c5, after which play can resemble the 2.d3 variation or the Closed Variation of the Sicilian Defence.
* 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3 is the Two Knights Variation: 3...d4 and 3...Nf6 are good replies for Black.
* 2.c4 (attempting to discourage 2...d5 by Black) is the Steiner Variation. But Black can reply 2...d5 anyway, when after 3.cxd5 exd5 4.exd5 Nf6 the only way for White to hold on to his extra pawn on d5 is to play 5.Bb5+. Black gets good compensation in return for the pawn, however.
* 2.Bb5 has occasionally been tried. Notably, Henry Bird defeated Max Fleissig with the variation during the Vienna 1873 chess tournament.
* 2.b3 leads to the Réti Gambit after 2...d5 3.Bb2 dxe4, but Black can also decline it with 3...Nf6 4.e5 Nd7 with White going for f4 and Qg4 before putting the knight on f3.
* 2.e5 the Steinitz Attack, offers no advantage to White after 2...d6; alternatively 2...d5 3.d4 transposes into the Advance Variation.

There are also a few rare continuations after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5, including 3.Bd3 (the Schlechter Variation), 3.Be3 (the Alapin Gambit), and 3.c4 (the Diemer–Duhm Gambit, which can also be reached via the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined).

==Early deviations for Black==
Although 2...d5 is the most consistent move after 1.e4 e6 2.d4, Black occasionally plays other moves. Chief among them is 2...c5, the Franco-Benoni Defence, so-called because it features the ...c7–c5 push characteristic of the Benoni Defence. White may continue 3.d5, when play can transpose into the Benoni, though White has extra options since c2–c4 is not mandated. 3.Nf3, transposing into a normal Sicilian Defence, and 3.c3, transposing into a line of the Alapin Sicilian (usually arrived at after 1.e4 c5 2.c3 e6 3.d4) are also common. Play may also lead back to the French; for example, 1.e4 e6 2.d4 c5 3.c3 d5 4.e5 transposes into the Advance Variation. 

Another move is 2...b6, which transposes into Owen&#x27;s Defence or the English Defence. Also possible is 2...f5, the Franco-Hiva Gambit, but this is regarded as dubious.

2...d6 is a version of the Lengfellner System, in which Black begins the game with ...e7-e6 and ...d7-d6 regardless of the opponent&#x27;s moves. (White can also play the Lengfellner System by opening e2-e2 and d2-d3). The Lengfellner System is usually adopted by players who wish to reach a stable position while avoiding opening theory.

==History==
The French Defence is named after a match played by correspondence between the cities of London and Paris in 1834 (although earlier examples of games with the opening do exist). It was Jacques Chamouillet, one of the players of the Paris team, who persuaded the others to adopt this defence.

As a reply to 1.e4, the French Defence received relatively little attention in the nineteenth century compared to 1...e5. The first world chess champion Wilhelm Steinitz said &quot;I have never in my life played the French Defence, which is the dullest of all openings&quot;. In the early 20th century, Géza Maróczy was perhaps the first world-class player to make it his primary weapon against 1.e4. For a long time, it was the third most popular reply to 1.e4, behind only 1...c5 and 1...e5. However, according to the Mega Database 2007, in 2006, 1...e6 was second only to the Sicilian in popularity.

Historically important contributors to the theory of the defence include Mikhail Botvinnik, Viktor Korchnoi, Akiba Rubinstein, Aron Nimzowitsch, Tigran Petrosian, Lev Psakhis, Wolfgang Uhlmann and Rafael Vaganian. More recently, its leading practitioners include Evgeny Bareev, Alexey Dreev, Mikhail Gurevich, Alexander Khalifman, Smbat Lputian, Alexander Morozevich, Teimour Radjabov, Nigel Short, Gata Kamsky, and Yury Shulman.

The Exchange Variation was recommended by Howard Staunton in the 19th century, but has been in decline ever since. In the early 1990s, Garry Kasparov briefly experimented with it before switching to 3.Nc3. Black&#x27;s game is made much easier as his queen&#x27;s bishop has been liberated. It has the reputation of giving immediate to Black due to the symmetrical pawn structure.

Like the Exchange, the Advance Variation was frequently played in the early days of the French Defence. Aron Nimzowitsch believed it to be White&#x27;s best choice and enriched its theory with many ideas. The Advance declined in popularity, however, throughout most of the 20th century until it was revived in the 1980s by GM and prominent opening theoretician Evgeny Sveshnikov, who continued to be a leading expert in this line. In recent years, it has become nearly as popular as 3.Nd2; GM Alexander Grischuk has championed it successfully at the highest levels. It is also a popular choice at the club level due to the availability of a simple, straightforward plan involving attacking chances and extra space.

==&quot;ECO&quot; codes==

<text>Winfield Bennett Mercer (January 31, 1910 – December 7, 1984), known professionally as Jack Mercer, was an American voice actor. He is best known as the voice of cartoon characters Popeye the Sailor Man and Felix the Cat. The son of vaudeville and Broadway performers, he also performed on the vaudeville and legitimate stages.

==Popeye the Sailor==
Mercer began his work in cartoons as an &quot;inbetweener&quot;, an apprentice animator at Fleischer Studios. Mercer liked to imitate voices, including one close call when he mimicked the high-pitched and loud voice of the wife of one of the Fleischers after he mistakenly thought she had left the studio.

When William Costello, the original cartoon voice of Popeye (1933–1935), became difficult to work with, he was dismissed. Mercer had begun imitating Costello&#x27;s interpretation of Popeye, and he practiced it until his voice &quot;cracked&quot; just right and he had it down. Searching for a replacement for Costello, Lou Fleischer heard Mercer singing the Popeye theme song and gave him the job of doing the voice. Mercer&#x27;s first cartoon was 1935&#x27;s &quot;King of the Mardi Gras&quot;.

Mercer voiced Popeye for more than 40 years, first for the Fleischers, then for Paramount&#x27;s Famous Studios cartoons (1942–1957), then for a series of television cartoons for King Features Syndicate (1961), and finally for a Saturday-morning cartoon show (1978-1983) produced by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Mercer also read the lines for the opening segment of the 1980 the live action film; the film&#x27;s regular role of Popeye was played by Robin Williams.

==Other voice work==
Mercer also did other cartoon voices. In the &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons he also voiced Wimpy, Poopdeck Pappy, and Popeye&#x27;s nephews. For Fleischer&#x27;s feature film &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; he voiced King Little, Twinkletoes the carrier pigeon, and the bumbling spies Sneak, Snoop, and Snitch. He played supporting characters Mr. Bumble and Swat (the Fly) for Fleischer&#x27;s second feature &quot;Mister Bug Goes to Town&quot;. He was also regularly cast with Pinto Colvig (who voiced Gabby from &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; and the spinoff &quot;Gabby&quot; film series). Mercer also played numerous supporting characters in Fleischer&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; series of 1941–1942. Mercer&#x27;s natural voice was relatively high-pitched for a man, and he was able to do some of the female voices as well.

Beginning in 1958 Mercer also provided all the voices for the &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; TV cartoons, including The Professor and Rock Bottom, produced by former Paramount animator Joe Oriolo. Mercer later worked with Oriolo on &quot;The Mighty Hercules&quot;.

In addition to his vocal talents, Mercer was also a prolific comedy writer. He wrote hundreds of scripts for various cartoon series at Paramount, including a number of &quot;Popeye&quot; episodes, as well as for television&#x27;s &quot;Deputy Dawg&quot; and &quot;Milton the Monster&quot;.

Jack Mercer appeared as himself on a 1973 episode of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, receiving one of four possible votes.

==Personal life==
Mercer&#x27;s first wife was Margie Hines, who provided the voice of Olive Oyl from 1939 to 1944. They were divorced in 1950. He later married Virginia Caroll, and the couple remained married until Mercer&#x27;s death in 1984.

Originally a resident of New York City, Mercer moved to Miami, Florida, when Fleischer Studios relocated there in 1938. After Famous Studios took over the Popeye cartoons, Mercer moved back to New York by early 1944. In the late 1970s he lived briefly in Los Angeles but moved back to New York City to live in Woodside, Queens.

==Death==
He died at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on December 7, 1984, after stomach cancer-related problems.

<text>Henri Jacques Chrétien (; 1 February 1879, Paris – 6 February 1956, Washington, D.C.) was a French astronomer and an inventor.
Born in Paris, France, his most famous inventions are:

* the anamorphic widescreen process, using an anamorphic lens system called Hypergonar, that resulted in the CinemaScope widescreen technique, and
* the co-invention, with George Willis Ritchey, of the Ritchey–Chrétien telescope, an improved type of astronomical telescope, employing a system now used in virtually all large research telescopes.

He spent part of his early astronomical career at the Nice Observatory, which was close to his house, the Villa Paradou. The Villa was built by famous French architect Charles Garnier who also built the Nice Observatory and both the operas of Paris and Monaco. In 1995, the abandoned villa was acquired by the artist Rainer Maria Latzke, who restored it and added new murals to the existing frescoes.

Chrétien was one of the founders of the &quot;Institut d&#x27;optique théorique et appliquée&quot; and professor at the French &quot;grande école&quot; SupOptique (École supérieure d&#x27;optique).

== Awards and honors ==
*The astronomical &quot;Chrétien International Research Grants&quot; awards are in honor of him
* In 1901, Chrétien, Joseph Joachim Landerer and Thomas David Anderson jointly received the Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Société astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society).
*Valz Prize from the French Academy of Sciences (1931)
*The crater Chrétien on the Moon is named in his honor. 
*In 1955, he received an Academy Award for his work on the CinemaScope process
*The &quot;Pavillon Henri Chrétien&quot;, an historical building on the Nice Observatory site which is visible from the city of Nice, also bears his name.

<doc id="203354" wikidata="Q2987365" url="?curid=203354" title="River Kennet">
<text>The Kennet is a tributary of the River Thames in Southern England. Most of the river is straddled by the North Wessex Downs AONB (Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty). The lower reaches have been made navigable as the Kennet Navigation, which – together with the Avon Navigation, the Kennet and Avon Canal and the Thames – links the cities of Bristol and London.

The length from near its sources west of Marlborough, Wiltshire down to Woolhampton, Berkshire is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). This is primarily from an array of rare plants and animals completely endemic to chalky watercourses.

When Wiltshire had second-tier local authorities, one, Kennet District, took the name of the river.

==Etymology==
The pronunciation (and spelling) was as the Kunnit (or Cunnit). This is likely derived from the Roman settlement in the upper valley floor, Cunetio (in the later large village of Mildenhall). Latin scholars state Cunetio is very unlikely to be a Latin derivation, meaning it is a Celtic British name, like most Roman town names in Britain. The frequent Celtic stem &quot;cun-&quot; means &quot;hound&quot;, as in the modern Welsh &quot;ci, cŵn&quot; &quot;dog&quot;.

==Course==

One of the Kennet&#x27;s sources is Swallowhead Spring near Silbury Hill in Wiltshire, and others are springs north of Avebury near the small villages of Uffcott and Broad Hinton. These then converge. In these early stages, the Kennet passes close by prehistoric sites, including Avebury Henge, West Kennet Long Barrow and Silbury Hill. The land drained by the headwaters normally has a deep water table (being in the North Wessex Downs which is mostly chalk as the upper subsoil), thus many stretches are winterbournes when and where precipitation is low and surrounding soils are not so dense with impermeables as to form a surface spring.

The river flows through the towns of Marlborough, Hungerford and Newbury before flowing into the Thames on the reach above Sonning Lock in central Reading, Berkshire.

The Og joins at Marlborough and the Dun enters at Hungerford, followed by the River Lambourn, Enborne and the Foudry Brook. For six miles (10 km) west of Reading&#x27;s centre, the Kennet, being barraged to maintain its longest heads of water, has a semi-natural secondary channel (a long leat, a corollary), the Holy Brook. This powered the mills belonging to Reading Abbey.

==Navigation==



The Horseshoe Bridge at Kennet Mouth, a timber-clad iron-truss structure, was built in 1891 as a way for horses towing barges along the Thames to cross the Kennet.

Going upstream, the first mile of the river, from Kennet Mouth to the High Bridge in Reading, has been navigable since at least the 13th century, providing wharfage for both the townspeople and Reading Abbey. Originally this short stretch of navigable river was under the control of the Abbey; today, including Blake&#x27;s Lock, it is administered by the Environment Agency as if it were part of the River Thames.

From High Bridge through to Newbury, the river was made navigable between 1718 and 1723 under the supervision of the engineer John Hore of Newbury. Known as the Kennet Navigation, this stretch of the river is now administered by the Canal &amp; River Trust as part of the Kennet and Avon Canal. Throughout the navigation, stretches of natural river bed alternate with of artificially created lock cuts, and a series of locks including County, Fobney, Southcote, Burghfield, Garston, Sheffield, Sulhamstead and Tyle Mill, to overcome a rise of .

==Wildlife==
The River Kennet is a haven for plants and animals. Its course takes it through the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and the river between Marlborough and Woolhampton is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The protection that this status affords the Kennet means that endangered species of plants and animals can be found here. The white drifts of water crowfoot (&quot;Ranunculus&quot;) in early summer are characteristic of chalk and limestone rivers; there are superb displays by the footbridge at Chilton Foliat, and by the road bridge in Hungerford.

Animal species such as the water vole, grass snake, reed bunting, brown trout, and brook lamprey flourish here, despite being in decline in other parts of the country. Crayfish are very common in parts of the river. However, most, if not all, are now the alien American signal crayfish, having escaped from crayfish farms, which has replaced the native white-clawed crayfish in most southern rivers, although a small population still survives in the River Lambourn. Many hundreds of insect species can be found in and around the River Kennet. There are large hatches of mayflies, whose long-tailed, short-lived adults are a favourite food of trout; many species of water beetle and insect larvae. Caddisflies are also numerous, especially in the late summer. Alongside the river, the reed beds, grasses and other vegetation support other species, including the scarlet tiger moth, poplar hawk moths and privet hawks.

==Resource uses==
Throughout its history, water mills on the Kennet have been a source of power for pre-industrial and industrial activities. In places the river has been built up to provide an additional head of water to drive the mills. Three mills remain in Ramsbury alone, and there are many disused or former mill sites, such as at Southcote, Burghfield, Sulhamstead, Aldermaston, Thatcham, Newbury, and Hungerford. Aside from the mills, in the 17th and 18th centuries the river water was also used for the brewing and tanning industries of Ramsbury and Marlborough.

== Water quality==
The Environment Agency measures the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

Water quality of the River Kennet in 2019:
===Insect kill of July 2013===
In July 2013 the Environment Agency investigated an insect kill which resulted when a small quantity (estimated to be two teaspoonfuls (10 millilitres)), of chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate insecticide used in ant poison and available in garden centres, was flushed into the river killing the freshwater shrimp and most other arthropods on the stretch of the river between Marlborough and Hungerford. The dead insects sank to the bottom of the river and rotted, resulting in a bad smell, but no fish seemed to have been killed. However, without insects and shrimps to feed on, many of the fish, birds and amphibians that use the river would be likely to fade away and die. The poison was diluted and removed by the flow of the stream.

<text>Magnetic resonance is a process by which a physical excitation (resonance) is set up via magnetism.

This process was used to develop magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS) technology.

It is also being used to develop nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computers.

== History ==
The first observation of electron-spin resonance was in 1944 by Y. K. Zavosky, a Soviet physicist then teaching at Kazan State University (now Kazan Federal University). Nuclear magnetic resonance was first observed in 1946 in the US by a team led by Felix Bloch at the same time as a separate team led by Edward Mills Purcell, the two of whom would later be the 1952 Nobel Laureates in Physics.

==Resonant and non-resonant methods==
A natural way to measure the separation between two energy levels is to find a measurable quantity defined by this separation and measure it. However, the precision of this method is limited by measurement precision and thus may be poor.

Alternatively, we can set up an experiment in which the system&#x27;s behavior depends on the energy level. If we apply an external field of controlled frequency, we can measure the level separation by noting at which frequency a qualitative change happens: that would mean that at this frequency, the transition between two states has a high probability. An example of such an experiment is a variation of Stern–Gerlach experiment, in which magnetic moment is measured by finding resonance frequency for the transition between two spin states.

<text>The following are lists of devices categorized as types of telescopes or devices associated with telescopes. They are broken into major classifications with many variations due to professional, amateur, and commercial sub-types. Telescopes can be classified by optical design or mechanical design/construction. Telescopes can also be classified by where they are placed, such as space telescopes. One major determining factor is type of light, or particle being observed including devices referred to as &quot;telescopes&quot; that do not form an image or use optics. Some telescopes are classified by the task they perform; for example Solar telescopes are all designs that look at the Sun, Dobsonian telescopes are designed to be low cost and portable, Aerial telescopes overcame the optical shortcomings of 17th-century objective lenses, etc.

==List of optical telescope types==
Optical telescopes can be classified by three primary optical designs (refractor, reflector, or catadioptric), by sub-designs of these types, by how they are constructed, or by the task they perform. They all have their different advantages and disadvantages and they are used in different areas of professional and amateur astronomy.
==List of telescope types working outside the optical spectrum==

*Atmospheric Cherenkov telescope used to detect gamma rays
*Infrared telescope

<doc id="203407" wikidata="Q5105" url="?curid=203407" title="Celine Dion">
<text>Céline Marie Claudette Dion ( , ; born 30 March 1968) is a Canadian singer. Referred to as the &quot;Queen of Power Ballads&quot;, Dion&#x27;s powerful, technically skilled vocals and commercially successful works have had a significant impact on popular music.

Born into a large family in Charlemagne, Quebec, Dion was discovered by her future manager and husband, René Angélil, and emerged as a teen star in her home country with a series of French-language albums during the 1980s. She gained international recognition by winning the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest, where she represented Switzerland with the song &quot;Ne partez pas sans moi&quot;. Dion went on to release twelve English-language albums, including &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; (1993), &quot;Falling into You&quot; (1996), &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; (1997), and &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot; (1999), all of which rank among the best-selling albums in history. Her catalog of high-charting tracks includes &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, &quot;Think Twice&quot;, &quot;To Love You More&quot;, &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot;, &quot;All by Myself&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Angel&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;, and &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, the theme for the 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot;.

Dion continued releasing French-language albums between each English record, with &quot;D&#x27;eux&quot; (1995) becoming the best-selling French-language album of all time. During the 2000s, she built her reputation as a successful live performer with A New Day... on the Las Vegas Strip (2003–2007), the highest-grossing concert residency of all time, and the Taking Chances World Tour (2008–2009), one of the highest-grossing concert tours of the 2000s. In 2009, she was named by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as the top-earning artist of the decade, with combined album sales and concert revenue exceeding $747 million. In 2022, Dion canceled her tour due to a diagnosis with stiff-person syndrome.

With over 200 million records sold worldwide, Dion is the best-selling Canadian recording artist, the best-selling French-language artist, and one of the best-selling musical artists of all time. Her accolades include 5 Grammy Awards, 20 Juno Awards and a recognition from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry for selling over 50 million albums in Europe. Seven of her albums have sold at least 10 million copies worldwide, the second most among women in history. She was ranked among the greatest women in music by VH1 and one of the greatest voices in music by MTV. Dion is one of the highest-grossing touring artists in history and the second woman to accumulate US$1 billion in concert revenue. One of the wealthiest musicians in the world, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked her the highest-paid female musician of 1997, 1998, 2004, and 2006. She received honorary doctorates in music from the Berklee College of Music and the .

== Life and career ==
=== 1968–1989: Early life and career beginnings ===

Dion was born in Charlemagne, Quebec, northeast of Montreal, the youngest of 14 children of Thérèse (, 1927–2020), a homemaker, and Adhémar Dion (1923–2003), a butcher, both of French descent. As the youngest of 14 children, Dion grew up wearing hand-me-downs and sharing a bed with several sisters. As a baby, she slept in a drawer instead of a crib to save money. She was bullied at school and called &quot;Vampire&quot; due to her teeth and skinny frame. Local tabloids even dubbed her &quot;Canine Dion&quot; in the teenage years of her career. She often spoke of running home from school to play music in the basement with her brothers and sisters. &quot;I detested school&quot;, she would later write in her autobiography. &quot;I had always lived surrounded by adults and children a lot older than me. I learned everything I needed to know from them. As far as I was concerned, real life existed around them.&quot; Dion&#x27;s eldest sister was already in her twenties, married, and pregnant with her first child at the time that Dion&#x27;s mother, Thérèse, was pregnant with Dion.

Dion was raised a Roman Catholic in a poor but, by her own account, happy home in Charlemagne. Music had always been a major part of the Dion family, and she was named after the song &quot;Céline&quot;, which French singer Hugues Aufray had recorded two years before her birth. On 13 August 1973, she performed publicly for the first time at her brother Michel&#x27;s wedding, singing Christine Charbonneau&#x27;s &quot;Du fil, des aiguilles et du coton&quot;. She continued to perform with her siblings in her parents&#x27; small piano bar called &quot;Le Vieux Baril&quot;, &quot;The Old Barrel&quot;.

She suffered a number of accidents as a young child, including an incident at five years old when she was struck by a car as her father and brother Clément looked on. She was hospitalized briefly with a concussion. From an early age, she had dreamed of being a performer. In a 1994 interview with &quot;People&quot;, she recalled, &quot;I missed my family and my home, but I don&#x27;t regret having lost my adolescence. I had one dream: I wanted to be a singer.&quot; As a child in Quebec, Dion participated in Girl Guide programs as a member of Girl Guides of Canada.

At age 12, she collaborated with her mother and her brother Jacques to write and compose her first song, &quot;Ce n&#x27;était qu&#x27;un rêve&quot;, whose title translates as &quot;It Was Only a Dream&quot; or &quot;Nothing But A Dream&quot;. Michel sent the recording to music manager René Angélil, whose name he discovered on the back of a Ginette Reno album. Angélil was moved to tears by Dion&#x27;s voice and decided to make her a star. In 1981, he mortgaged his home to fund her first record, &quot;La voix du bon Dieu&quot;, which later became a local No. 1 hit and made her an instant star in Quebec. Her popularity spread to other parts of the world when she competed in the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo and won the musician&#x27;s award for &quot;Top Performer&quot; as well as the gold medal for &quot;Best Song&quot; with &quot;Tellement j&#x27;ai d&#x27;amour pour toi&quot;.

By 1983, in addition to becoming the first Canadian artist to receive a gold record in France for the single &quot;D&#x27;amour ou d&#x27;amitié&quot; (&quot;Of Love or of Friendship&quot;), Dion had also won several Félix Awards, including &quot;Best Female performer&quot; and &quot;Discovery of the Year&quot;. Further success came when she represented Switzerland in the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;Ne partez pas sans moi&quot; and won the contest by a close margin in Dublin. At age 18, after seeing a Michael Jackson performance, Dion told Angélil she wanted to be a star like Jackson. Though confident in her talent, Angélil realized her image needed to be changed for her to be marketed worldwide. She withdrew from the spotlight for a number of months, during which she underwent dental surgery to improve her appearance, and was sent to the École Berlitz in 1989 to improve her English. In 1989, during a concert on the Incognito tournée, she injured her voice. She consulted the otorhinolaryngologist William Gould, who gave her an ultimatum: have immediate surgery on her vocal cords or do not utilize them at all for three weeks. Dion chose the latter and underwent vocal training with William Riley.

=== 1990–1992: &quot;Unison&quot;, &quot;Dion chante Plamondon&quot;, and &quot;Celine Dion&quot; ===
Two years after she learned English, Dion made her debut into the Anglophone market with &quot;Unison&quot; (1990), the lead single having originally been recorded by English singer Junior in 1983 and later Laura Branigan. She incorporated the help of producers including Vito Luprano and David Foster. The album was largely influenced by 1980s soft rock music and quickly found a niche within the adult contemporary radio format. &quot;Unison&quot; also hit the right notes with critics: Jim Farber of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote her vocals were &quot;tastefully unadorned&quot;, and she never attempted to &quot;bring off styles that are beyond her&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared it &quot;a fine, sophisticated American debut&quot;. Singles from the album included &quot;(If There Was) Any Other Way&quot;, &quot;The Last to Know&quot;, &quot;Unison&quot;, and &quot;Where Does My Heart Beat Now&quot;, a mid-tempo soft-rock ballad made prominent use of the electric guitar. The latter became her first top-ten hit on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number four. In 1991, Dion was a featured soloist on &quot;Voices That Care&quot;, a tribute to American troops fighting in Operation Desert Storm.

Her real international breakthrough came when she duetted with Peabo Bryson on the title track to Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991). It became her first top-ten hit in the UK and her second top-ten hit in the US. The song earned its songwriters an Academy Award for Best Song and gave Dion her first Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; served as the lead single from her 1992 self-titled album, which, like her debut, had a strong pop rock influence combined with elements of soul and classical music. Owing to the success of the lead-off single and her collaborations with David Foster and Diane Warren, the album was even more well-received commercially than &quot;Unison&quot;; it was certified diamond in Canada and double platinum in the U.S. The album&#x27;s second single &quot;If You Asked Me To&quot; (a cover of Patti LaBelle&#x27;s song from the 1989 movie &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;) became her first number-one single in Canada and peaked at number four on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Also during this time, Dion released the Francophone album &quot;Dion chante Plamondon&quot;. The album consisted mostly of covers, but featured four new songs: &quot;Des mots qui sonnent&quot;, &quot;Je danse dans ma tête&quot;, &quot;Quelqu&#x27;un que j&#x27;aime, quelqu&#x27;un qui m&#x27;aime&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;amour existe encore&quot;. It was originally released in Canada and France between 1991 and 1992, then later received an international release in 1994, the first French Celine Dion album to do so. &quot;Un garçon pas comme les autres (Ziggy)&quot; became a smash hit in France, reaching No. 2 and being certified gold. In Quebec, the album was certified Gold the day it was released.

By 1992, &quot;Unison&quot;, &quot;Celine Dion&quot;, and numerous high-profile media appearances had propelled Dion to superstardom in North America. She had achieved one of her main objectives: wedging her way into the Anglophone market and achieving fame. However, while she was experiencing rising success in the U.S., her French fans in Canada criticized her for neglecting them. She would later rebuff these criticisms at the 1991 Félix Awards show, where, after winning &quot;English Artist of the Year&quot;, she openly declined the award. She asserted she was—and would always be—a French, not an English, artist. Indeed, she speaks English with a noticeable Quebec French accent to this day. Apart from her commercial success, there were also changes in her personal life, as Angélil, who was 26 years her senior, transitioned from manager to lover. However, the relationship was kept a secret as they both feared the public would find it inappropriate.

=== 1993–1995: &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; and &quot;D&#x27;eux&quot; ===
In 1993, Dion announced her feelings for her manager by declaring him &quot;the colour of [her] love&quot; in the dedication section of her third English-language album &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot;. However, instead of criticizing their relationship as she had feared, fans embraced the couple. Eventually, Angélil and Dion married in an extravagant wedding ceremony on 17 December 1994, which was broadcast live on Canadian television.

As with most of her catalogue, &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; had overarching themes of love and romance. It became her most successful record up to point, selling more than six million copies in the US, two million in Canada, and peaking at No. 1 in many countries. The album also spawned Dion&#x27;s first US, Canadian, and Australian No. 1 single &quot;The Power of Love&quot; (a remake of Jennifer Rush&#x27;s 1985 hit), which would become her signature hit in various nations until she reached new career heights in the late 1990s.

The single &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;, a duet with Clive Griffin, achieved moderate success on the U.S. and Canadian charts and was nominated for two Grammy Awards, winning one. &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot; also became Dion&#x27;s first major hit in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom. Both the album and the single &quot;Think Twice&quot; simultaneously occupied the top of the British charts for five consecutive weeks. &quot;Think Twice&quot;, which remained at No. 1 for seven weeks, eventually became the fourth single by a female artist to sell in excess of one million copies in the UK while the album was eventually certified five-times platinum for two million copies sold.

Dion kept to her French roots and continued to release many Francophone recordings between each English record. Generally, they achieved more credibility than her English-language works. She released &quot;À l&#x27;Olympia&quot;, a live album recorded during one of her concerts at the Paris Olympia in 1994. It had one promotional single, a live version of &quot;Calling You&quot;, which peaked at seventy-five on the French Singles Chart. She also recorded a bilingual version of &quot;Petit Papa Noël&quot; with Alvin and the Chipmunks for the 1994 holiday album &quot;A Very Merry Chipmunk&quot;. &quot;D&#x27;eux&quot; (also known as &quot;The French Album&quot; in the United States), was released in 1995, and it would go on to become the best-selling French-language album of all time. The album was mostly written and produced by Jean-Jacques Goldman, and amassed huge success with the singles &quot;Pour que tu m&#x27;aimes encore&quot; and &quot;Je sais pas&quot;. &quot;Pour que tu m&#x27;aimes encore&quot; reached No. 1 in France and stayed at the top position for twelve weeks. It was later certified Platinum in France. The single reached the top ten in the UK and Ireland, a rare accomplishment for a French song. &quot;Je sais pas&quot;, the second single off the album, reached No. 1 on the French Singles Chart as well and was certified Silver there.

During the mid-1990s and onward, Dion&#x27;s albums were generally constructed on the basis of melodramatic soft rock ballads, with sprinklings of up-tempo pop and rare forays into other genres. She collaborated with writers and producers such as Jim Steinman and David Foster, who helped her to develop a signature sound. While critical reviews fluctuated, her releases performed increasingly well on the international charts, and in 1996, she won the World Music Award for &quot;World&#x27;s Best-selling Female Recording Artist of the Year&quot; for the third time. By the mid-1990s, she had established herself as one of the best-selling artists in the world.

=== 1996–1999: &quot;Falling into You&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot;, and &quot;S&#x27;il suffisait d&#x27;aimer&quot; ===

In the five years since her debut English language album in 1990, &quot;Billboard&quot; stated she had already sold 40 million albums worldwide. &quot;Falling into You&quot; (1996), Dion&#x27;s fourth English-language album, presented Dion at the height of her popularity and showed a further progression of her music. In an attempt to reach a wider audience, the album combined many elements, such as complex orchestral sounds, African chanting, and elaborate musical effects. Additionally, instruments like the violin, Spanish guitar, trombone, the cavaquinho, and saxophone created a new sound. The singles encompassed a variety of musical styles. The title track &quot;Falling into You&quot; and &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot; (a Tina Turner cover) made prominent use of percussion instruments; &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot; (produced by its writer, Jim Steinman) and a remake of Eric Carmen&#x27;s &quot;All by Myself&quot; maintained a soft-rock atmosphere, combined with the classical sound of the piano; and the No. 1 single &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot;, which was written by Diane Warren, was a pop ballad served as the theme to the 1996 film &quot;Up Close and Personal&quot;.

&quot;Falling into You&quot; garnered career-best reviews for Dion. While Dan Leroy wrote it was not very different from her previous work with Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Natalie Nichols of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writing the album was &quot;formulaic&quot;, other critics, such as Chuck Eddy of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, and Daniel Durchholz, lavished the album as &quot;compelling&quot;, &quot;passionate&quot;, &quot;stylish&quot;, &quot;elegant&quot;, and &quot;remarkably well-crafted&quot;. &quot;Falling into You&quot; became Dion&#x27;s most critically and commercially successful album, topping the charts in many countries and becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time.

In 2013, CBC Music ranked &quot;Falling into You&quot; 33rd in their list of the 100 greatest Canadian albums ever. In the United States, the album reached No. 1, and was later certified 12× Platinum for over 12 million copies shipped. In Canada, the album was certified diamond for over one million copies shipped. The IFPI certified &quot;Falling into You&quot; 9× Platinum, an accolade has been given to only two other albums in history, with one of the two being Dion&#x27;s own album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot;. The album also won Grammy Awards for Best Pop Album and the academy&#x27;s highest honour, Album of the Year. In March 1996, she launched the Falling into You Tour in support of her new album, performing concerts around the world for over a year. In July 1996, she performed &quot;The Power of the Dream&quot; at the 1996 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. 
 She followed &quot;Falling into You&quot; with &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; (1997), which was publicized as its sequel. The recording process took place in London, New York City, and Los Angeles, and featured a host of special guests, such as Barbra Streisand on &quot;Tell Him&quot;; the Bee Gees on &quot;Immortality&quot;; and tenor Luciano Pavarotti on &quot;I Hate You Then I Love You&quot;. Other musicians included Carole King, George Martin, Bryan Adams and Jamaican singer Diana King, who added a reggae tinge to &quot;Treat Her Like a Lady&quot;.

&quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; was another major success, reaching No. 1 all over the world, attaining platinum status in twenty-four sales territories, and becoming the fastest selling album of her career. In the United States, the album topped the chart in its seventh week of release, and was later certified 11× Platinum in the U.S. for over 11 million copies shipped. In Canada, the album sold 230,212 copies in its first week of release, which remains a record. It was eventually certified diamond in Canada for over one million copies shipped. The most successful single from the album was the classically influenced ballad &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, which was written and composed by James Horner and Will Jennings, and produced by Horner and Walter Afanasieff.

Serving as the love theme for the 1997 blockbuster film &quot;Titanic&quot;, the song topped the charts across the world and became Dion&#x27;s signature song. Horner and Jennings won the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Original Song, while Dion herself garnered two Grammy Awards for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and the most coveted, Record of the Year, (the song itself won four awards, but two were presented to the songwriters). &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; and &quot;Think Twice&quot; made her the only female artist in the UK to have two singles to sell more than a million copies. In support of her album, she embarked on the Let&#x27;s Talk About Love Tour between 1998 and 1999.

Dion ended the 1990s with three more extremely successful albums: the Christmas album &quot;These Are Special Times&quot; (1998), the French-language album, &quot;S&#x27;il suffisait d&#x27;aimer&quot;, and the compilation album &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot; (1999). On &quot;These Are Special Times&quot;, she co-wrote the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Save It All for Christmas Day&quot; along with Ric Wake and Peter Zizzo. The album was her most classically influenced yet, with orchestral arrangements found on virtually every track. The album featured the single &quot;I&#x27;m Your Angel&quot; (a duet with R. Kelly), which became her fourth US No. 1 single, and a smash hit across the world. The album&#x27;s second single &quot;The Prayer&quot; (a duet with Andrea Bocelli) served as the soundtrack of the 1998 film &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot; and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot; drew together her most successful hits coupled with seven new songs, including the lead-off single &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot;, a cover of Roberta Flack&#x27;s &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;, and &quot;All the Way&quot;, a duet with Frank Sinatra. &quot;All the Way&quot; became one of the best-selling compilation albums of all time, reaching No. 1 in the United States for three weeks. The album was later certified 7× Platinum in the U.S. for 7 million copies shipped. It also topped the charts in the UK, Canada, and Australia. Her last French-language studio album of the 1990s, &quot;S&#x27;il suffisait d&#x27;aimer&quot;, was very successful as well, topping the charts in every major French-speaking country, including France, Switzerland, the Wallonia region of Belgium, and Canada. In France, the album was certified diamond, selling 1.5 million copies. By the end of the 1990s, Dion had sold more than 130 million records worldwide, and had won a slew of industry awards. Her status as one of the music industry&#x27;s biggest pop divas was further solidified when she was asked to perform on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Divas Live&quot; special in 1998, with superstars Aretha Franklin, Gloria Estefan, Shania Twain, and Mariah Carey. That year, she also received two of the highest Canadian honours: &quot;Officer of the Order of Canada for Outstanding Contribution to the World of Contemporary Music&quot; and &quot;Officer of the National Order of Quebec&quot;. A year later, she was inducted into the Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame, and was honoured with a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

Starting from the mid-1990s, the pop rock influence more noticeable in her earlier releases was replaced by a more mature feel. Additionally, the recurring theme of &quot;love&quot; dominated most of her releases, which led to some critics dismissing her music as banal. Other critics, like Elysa Gardner and Jose F. Promis, praised her voice during this period, describing it as a &quot;technical marvel&quot;. Steve Dollar, in his review of &quot;These Are Special Times&quot;, opined Dion was a &quot;vocal Olympian for whom there ain&#x27;t no mountain—or scale—high enough&quot;.

=== 2000–2003: Hiatus, &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot;, &quot;One Heart&quot;, and &quot;1 fille &amp; 4 types&quot; ===

After releasing and promoting thirteen albums during the 1990s, Dion stated she needed to settle down, and announced on her latest album &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot;, she needed to take a step back from the spotlight and enjoy life. Angélil&#x27;s diagnosis with esophageal cancer also prompted her to hiatus. While on break, she was unable to escape the spotlight. In 2000, the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; published a false story about Dion. Brandishing a picture of Dion and her husband, the magazine misquoted her, printing the headline, &quot;Celine — &#x27;I&#x27;m Pregnant With Twins!&#x27;&quot; She sued the magazine for more than $20million. The editors printed an apology and a full retraction in the next issue, and donated money to the American Cancer Society in honour of her and her husband. A year after the incident, after undergoing fertility treatments, she gave birth to a son, René-Charles Dion Angélil, on 25 January 2001, in Florida.

Following the 11 September attacks, Dion returned to the music scene, and in a televised performance sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; at the benefit concert . Chuck Taylor of &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote, &quot;the performance ... brings to mind what has made her one of the celebrated vocalists of our time: the ability to render emotion that shakes the soul. Affecting, meaningful, and filled with grace, this is a musical reflection to share with all of us still searching for ways to cope.&quot; She performed it again in 2003 during pregame festivities for Super Bowl XXXVII in Qualcomm Stadium. In December 2001, she published her autobiography, &quot;My Story, My Dream&quot;, which chronicled her rags-to-riches story.

Dion ended her three-year sabbatical from the music industry with the aptly titled album &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot;, released in March 2002. The album was her most personal yet, with songs focusing on her motherhood and maturation as a woman such as &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot;, and &quot;Goodbye&#x27;s (The Saddest Word)&quot;. She stated: &quot;Becoming a mother makes you a grown-up.&quot; She also stated: &quot;&quot;A New Day Has Come&quot;, for Rene, for me, is the baby. It has everything to do with the baby ... The song &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; represents very well the mood I&#x27;m feeling right now. It represents the whole album.&quot; &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; debuted at No. 1 in more than 17 countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada. In the United States, the album debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first-week sales of 527,000 copies; marking her first No. 1 debut on the chart, as well as the highest debut sales week of her career in the U.S. It was eventually certified 3× Platinum in the United States, and 6× Platinum in Canada.

While the album was commercially successful, critical reviews suggested it was &quot;forgettable&quot; and the lyrics were &quot;lifeless&quot;. Both Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, stated Dion&#x27;s music had not developed much during her break, and classed her material as trite and mediocre. Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; called the album &quot;a lengthy collection of drippy, gooey pop fluffer-nutter&quot;. The first single off the album, &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; peaked at No.22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts, being an airplay-only release. On the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, however, the song spent 21 consecutive weeks at No. 1, breaking the record for the longest span at the top. The previous record holders were Phil Collins&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;ll Be in My Heart&quot; and Dion&#x27;s own &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot;, both of which lasted nineteen weeks at No. 1. The album&#x27;s next single, &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;, was featured on the soundtrack for &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; (2002), and was ranked number 2 on the European Hot 100 Singles, and number 6 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks in the United States. During 2002, she performed for many benefit concerts, including her second appearance on VH1 Divas Live, a concert to benefit the VH1 Save The Music Foundation, alongside Cher, Anastacia, Dixie Chicks, Mary J. Blige, Whitney Houston, Cyndi Lauper, Shakira, and Stevie Nicks.

In conjunction with an endorsement deal with Chrysler, she released &quot;One Heart&quot; (2003), an album representing her appreciation for life. The album largely consisted of pop and dance music—a deviation from the soaring, melodramatic ballads, for which she had been known. Although the album achieved moderate success, &quot;One Heart&quot; was met with mixed criticism, and words such as &quot;predictable&quot; and &quot;banal&quot; appeared even in the most lenient reviews. A cover of the 1989 Cyndi Lauper hit &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;, released to launch her advertising campaign with Chrysler, incorporated elements of dance-pop and rock and roll. The advertising deal was met with criticism, with some stating Dion was trying to cater to her sponsors.

After &quot;One Heart&quot;, she released her next English-language studio album, &quot;Miracle&quot; (2004). &quot;Miracle&quot; was a multimedia project conceived by Dion and Australian photographer Anne Geddes and had a theme centring on babies and motherhood. The album was filled with lullabies and other songs of maternal love and inspiration, including covers of Louis Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; and John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot;. The reviews for &quot;Miracle&quot; were mixed. Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three of out five stars, stating, &quot;The worst you can say about the record is that there are no surprises, but the audience for this record doesn&#x27;t want surprises; they want comfort, whether it arrives in polished music or artsy photos of newborns, and Miracle provides both, which makes it appealing for those expectant or new mothers in Dion&#x27;s audience.&quot; Chuck Taylor of &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote the single &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot; was &quot;an unexpected gem&quot; and called Dion &quot;a timeless, enormously versatile artist&quot;, Chuck Arnold of &quot;People&quot;, however, labelled the album as excessively sentimental, while Nancy Miller of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; opined that &quot;the whole earth-mama act is just opportunism, reborn&quot;. &quot;Miracle&quot; debuted at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and No. 1 in Canada and was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA.

The francophone album (&quot;1 Girl &amp; 4 Guys&quot;), released in October 2003, fared better than her previous two releases and showed her trying to distance herself from the &quot;diva&quot; image. She recruited Jean-Jacques Goldman, Gildas Arzel, Eric Benzi, and Jacques Veneruso, with whom she had previously worked on two of her best-selling French albums &quot;S&#x27;il suffisait d&#x27;aimer&quot; and &quot;D&#x27;eux&quot;. Labeled &quot;the album of pleasure&quot; by Dion herself, the album cover showed her in a simple and relaxed manner, contrary to the choreographed poses usually found on her album covers. The album achieved widespread commercial success in France, Canada, and Belgium where it reached No. 1. In France, the album debuted at No. 1 and was later certified 2× platinum after selling over 700,000 copies. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote Dion&#x27;s vocals were &quot;back at top of their game&quot; and she was &quot;getting back to pop basics and performing at a level unheard in a while&quot;.

Though her albums were commercially successful, they did not achieve the sales or the reception of her previous works. Her songs received less airplay as radio became less embracing of balladeers like Dion, Carey, and Houston, and was focused on more up-tempo, urban/hip-hop songs. By 2004, Dion had accumulated sales of more than 175 million albums worldwide and received the Chopard Diamond Award from the World Music Awards for her achievements. According to the official World Music Awards website, the award is rare; it is &quot;not presented every year&quot; and an artist can be presented with the award only for selling &quot;over 100 million albums during their career&quot;.

=== 2003–2007: A New Day... residency ===
In early 2002, Dion announced a three-year, 600-show contract to appear five nights a week in an entertainment extravaganza, A New Day..., at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace. This move was generally seen as risky, but journalist Miriam Nunzio wrote it was &quot;one of the smartest business decisions in years by any major recording artist&quot;. Dion conceived the show after seeing &quot;O&quot; by Franco Dragone during her break from recording, and it premiered on 25 March 2003, in a 4,000-seat arena specifically designed for her show and modelled after the Roman Colosseum. Many stars attended the opening night including Dick Clark, Alan Thicke, Kathy Griffin, Lance Bass, and Justin Timberlake, who hosted the television special. The show, directed by Dragone and choreographed by Mia Michaels, was a combination of dance, music, and visual effects. It included Dion performing her biggest hits against an array of dancers and special effects. Reviewer Mike Weatherford felt that, at first, Dion was not as relaxed as she should be, and at times, it was hard to find her among the excessive stage ornamentation and dancers. However, he noted the show had become more enjoyable over the course of its run, because of her improved stage-presence and simplified costumes.

The show was well received by audiences; it routinely sold out until its end in late 2007. Ticket prices averaged US $135.33. According to &quot;Pollstar&quot;, Dion sold 322,000 tickets and grossed US $43.9 million in the first half of 2005, and by July 2005, she had sold out 315 out of 384 shows. By the end of 2005, she grossed more than US $76 million, placing sixth on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s Money Makers list for 2005&quot;. Because of the show&#x27;s success, her contract was extended into 2007 for an undisclosed sum. On 5 January 2007, it was announced the show would end on 15 December 2007, with tickets for the period after October 2007 having gone on sale from 1 March. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, A New Day... is the most successful residency of all time, grossing over US$385 million ($ million in dollars) and drawing nearly three million people to 717 shows. The &quot;Live in Las Vegas: A New Day...&quot; DVD was released on 10 December 2007, in Europe and the following day in North America.

=== 2007–2010: &quot;D&#x27;elles&quot;, &quot;Taking Chances&quot;, and Taking Chances Tour ===
On 21 May 2007, Dion released the French-language album &quot;D&#x27;elles&quot; &quot;(About Them)&quot;, which debuted at the top of the Canadian album charts, selling 72,200 copies in its first week. It marked her tenth No. 1 album in the SoundScan era, and her eighth debut at the top position. In Canada, the album has been certified 2× platinum, and within the first month had already shipped half a million units worldwide. &quot;D&#x27;Elles&quot; also reached No. 1 in France and Belgium. The first single &quot;Et s&#x27;il n&#x27;en restait qu&#x27;une (je serais celle-là)&quot; (meaning &quot;And If There Was Only One Woman Left (I Would Be That One)&quot;) debuted at the top of the French singles chart a month earlier. Later in same year, she released the English album &quot;Taking Chances&quot; on 12 November in Europe, and 13 November in North America. Her first English studio album since 2003&#x27;s &quot;One Heart&quot;, it featured pop, R&amp;B, and rock inspired music. For this album, she collaborated with John Shanks and ex-Evanescence guitarist Ben Moody, as well as Kristian Lundin, Peer Åström, Linda Perry, Japanese singer Yuna Ito, and R&amp;B singer and songwriter Ne-Yo. Dion stated, &quot;I think this album represents a positive evolution in my career ... I&#x27;m feeling strong, maybe a little gutsier than in the past, and just as passionate about music and life as I ever was.&quot; She launched her year-long global Taking Chances Tour on 14 February 2008 in South Africa, performing 132 dates in stadiums and arenas across 5 continents.

The Taking Chances Tour was a great success in the United States, reaching the No. 1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Boxscore, having sold out every concert in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, she appeared on &quot;Idol Gives Back&quot; for a second year in a row. Dion was nominated for six Juno Awards in 2008, adding to her 53 previous nominations (an all-time record). Her nominations included Artist of the Year, Pop Album of the Year (for &quot;Taking Chances&quot;), Francophone Album of the Year (for &quot;D&#x27;elles&quot;) and Album of the Year (for both &quot;Taking Chances&quot; and &quot;D&#x27;elles&quot;). The following year, she was nominated for 3 Juno Awards including the Fan Choice Award, Song of the Year (for &quot;Taking Chances&quot;), and Music DVD of the Year (for &quot;Live in Las Vegas: A New Day...&quot;)
On 22 August 2008, Dion presented a free outdoor concert, mostly in French, on the Plains of Abraham, for the 400th anniversary of Quebec City. The celebration gathered approximately 490,000 people. The concert, called &quot;Céline sur les Plaines&quot;, was released on DVD on 11 November 2008, in Quebec and was released on 20 May 2009, in France. Late October 2008 saw the worldwide release of a comprehensive English-language greatest hits album, &quot;My Love: Essential Collection&quot;.

In May 2009, Dion was named the 20th best-selling artist of the decade and the second-best-selling female artist of the decade in the United States, selling an estimated 17.57 million copies of her albums there since 2000. In June 2009, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported she earned $100 million during 2008. In December 2009, Pollstar announced she was the highest-grossing solo live music act in North America of the decade, second overall behind only the Dave Matthews Band. She grossed $522.2 million during the decade, a large portion of the sum coming from her five-year residency at Caesars Palace.

In January 2010, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; presented its annual list of the top ten largest earners of the year, revealing Dion took the top spot for the entire decade, with $747.9 million in total revenue from 2000 to 2009. The largest haul came from ticket sales, totalling $522.2 million. Additionally, she was named &quot;Artist of the Decade&quot; in Quebec, announced by &quot;Le Journal de Québec&quot; in December 2009. A public online survey asked responders to vote for whom they believe deserved the above-mentioned accolade.

On 17 February 2010, Dion released into theatres a documentary film about her &quot;Taking Chances Tour&quot;, titled, &quot;&quot;. The documentary shows behind-the-scenes footage of her both onstage and offstage, along with footage of her with her family as they travelled the world with her. The distributor is the Sony Pictures subsidiary, Hot Ticket. The film was later released on Blu-ray and DVD on 4 May 2010, along with the CD/DVD, &quot;Taking Chances World Tour: The Concert&quot;. At the 52nd Grammy Awards in February 2010, Dion joined Carrie Underwood, Usher, Jennifer Hudson, and Smokey Robinson to perform the song &quot;Earth Song&quot; during the 3-D Michael Jackson tribute.

Furthermore, in a May 2010 Harris Poll, Dion was named the most popular musician in the United States, ahead of U2, Elvis Presley, and The Beatles while factoring in gender, political affiliations, geographic region of residence, and income. Specifically, she was the most popular musician in the female demographic, as well as among all Democrats, those who live in the eastern United States and southern United States, and those who have incomes between US$35k and US$74.9k. In September 2010, she released the single &quot;Voler&quot;, a duet with French singer Michel Sardou. The song was later included on Sardou&#x27;s album. In addition, it was announced in October 2010 that Dion wrote and composed a new song for Canadian singer Marc Dupré; this song is entitled &quot;Entre deux mondes&quot;.

In an interview with &quot;People&quot; published in February 2010, Dion announced she would be returning to Caesars Palace for &quot;Celine&quot;, a three-year residency for seventy shows a year, beginning 15 March 2011. She stated the show will feature, &quot;all the songs from my repertoire people want to hear&quot; and will contain a selection of music from classic Hollywood films. To promote her return to Las Vegas, Dion made an appearance on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; on 21 February, during the show&#x27;s final season, marking her record twenty-seventh appearance. In 2018, &quot;Billboard&quot; stated her residency &quot;Celine&quot; is the second most successful residency of all time. By the end of 2011, Dion has sold 331,000 albums (despite not releasing any studio album since 2007) and 956,000 digital tracks in the United States.

For a record sixth time, she performed at the 83rd Academy Awards, where she sang the song &quot;Smile&quot;, as part of the ceremony&#x27;s &quot;In Memoriam&quot; segment. On 4 September, she appeared on the 2011 MDA Labor Telethon Event and presented a prerecorded performance of &quot;Open Arms&quot; from her new Las Vegas show. On 1 October 2011, the OWN Network premiered a documentary on Dion&#x27;s life, detailing the months before, during and after her pregnancy, to the makings of her new Las Vegas Show, called, &quot;Celine: 3 Boys and a New Show&quot;. The documentary became the second highest rated show on TV OWN Canada. In October, FlightNetwork.com conducted a poll asking 780 participants which celebrity they would most like to sit next to on an airplane. Dion was the top favourite, with 23.7% of the vote. Also, in September, she released the 14th perfume from her Celine Dion Parfums Collection, called &quot;Signature&quot;.

On 13 August 2014, Dion announced the indefinite postponement of all her show business activities, including her concert residency at Caesars Palace, and the cancellation of her Asia Tour, because of the worsening of her husband&#x27;s health after he underwent the removal of a cancerous tumor in December 2013. However, on 20 March 2015, she announced she would be returning to the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in late August 2015.

=== 2022–present: Illness, acting debut and Paris Olympics ===
On 15 January 2022, Dion canceled her North American tour dates because of severe muscle spasms. On 8 December, she announced she had been diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome, a rare neurological disease. She said the disease affected every aspect of her life, making it difficult to walk, and affected her vocal cords. All her tour dates were cancelled.In 2023, Dion starred as herself in &quot;Love Again&quot;, her first acting appearance in a feature film. She also recorded five new songs for the soundtrack, released on 12 May; the first single, &quot;Love Again&quot;, premiered on 13 April. On 3 May 2024, a mashup of Dion&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; and the Whispers&#x27; 1979 song &quot;And the Beat Goes On&quot; was released as a single. &quot;Set My Heart on Fire (I&#x27;m Alive x And the Beat Goes On)&quot;, by Majestic and the Jammin Kid, also includes Dion as a lead credit. The single debuted at number 6 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart.
On 25 June 2024, Amazon MGM Studios released a documentary about Dion&#x27;s life with stiff-person syndrome, &quot;I Am: Celine Dion&quot;. The &quot;I Am: Celine Dion&quot; soundtrack was released on 21 June. On 26 July, Dion sang &quot;Hymne à l’amour&quot; from the Eiffel Tower to conclude the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. It was her first public performance in four years. Reviewing the ceremony, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that Dion&#x27;s performance was an &quot;undaunted, beatific return&quot;, with &quot;the gusto of someone who, by her own admission, longs to resume touring more than her fans&quot;. On 13 November, Dion walked the runway at the 1000 Seasons of Elie Saab fashion show in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where she performed &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; and &quot;The Power of Love&quot;.

== Artistry ==
=== Influences ===
Dion cites idols as varied as Michael Jackson, Aretha Franklin, Charles Aznavour, Carole King, Anne Murray, Barbra Streisand, Whitney Houston and the Bee Gees. She eventually collaborated with most of them. Michael Jackson in particular was a major motivation for her to learn English as early as in the 1980s. Her music has been influenced by numerous genres, including pop, rock, gospel, R&amp;B, and soul, and her lyrics focus on themes of poverty, world hunger, and spirituality, with an emphasis on love and romance. After the birth of her first child, her work increasingly focused on maternal love.

=== Musical style ===
Dion has faced considerable criticism from critics, who state that her music often retreats behind pop and soul conventions, and is marked by excessive sentimentality. According to Keith Harris of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, &quot;[Dion&#x27;s] sentimentality is bombastic and defiant rather than demure and retiring ... [she] stands at the end of the chain of drastic devolution that goes Aretha–Whitney–Mariah. Far from being an aberration, Dion actually stands as a symbol of a certain kind of pop sensibility—bigger is better, too much is never enough, and the riper the emotion the more true.&quot; Her recordings have been mainly in English and French, although she has also sung in several other languages including Japanese, Italian, German, Mandarin, Spanish, and Neapolitan. Her francophone releases, by contrast, tend to be deeper and more varied than her English releases, and consequently have achieved more credibility.

Critics have stated that Dion&#x27;s involvement in the production aspect of her music is fundamentally lacking, which results in her work being overproduced and impersonal. However, coming from a family in which all of her siblings were musicians, she dabbled in learning how to play instruments like piano and guitar, and practised with a Fender Stratocaster during the recording sessions for her album &quot;Falling into You&quot;.

Occasionally, Dion has contributed to the writing of a handful of her English and French songs, as well as writing a few songs for other artists such as Marc Dupré. Additionally, as her career progressed, she found herself taking charge in the production of her albums. On her first English album, which she recorded before she had a firm command of the English language, she expressed disapproval, which could have been avoided if she had assumed more creative input. By the time she released her second English album &quot;Celine Dion&quot;, she assumed more control of the production and recording process, hoping to dispel earlier criticisms. She stated, &quot;On the second album I said, &#x27;Well, I have the choice to be afraid one more time and not be 100% happy, or not be afraid and be part of this album.&#x27; This is my album.&quot; Besides her contributions to some of her early French albums, Dion wrote a few of the songs on &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; (1997) and &quot;These Are Special Times&quot; (1998).

She is often the subject of media ridicule and parody and is frequently impersonated on shows such as &quot;MADtv&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot;, and &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; for her strong accent and onstage gesticulations. However, she has stated that she is unaffected by the comments, and is flattered that people take the time to impersonate her. She even invited Ana Gasteyer, who parodied her on &quot;SNL&quot;, to appear onstage during one of her performances in New York City. While she is rarely politically outspoken, in 2005 following the Hurricane Katrina disaster, Dion appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and tearfully criticized the US government&#x27;s slow response in aiding the victims of the hurricane: &quot;There&#x27;s people still there waiting to be rescued. To me that is not acceptable ... How can it be so easy to send planes in another country to kill everybody in a second and destroy lives. We need to serve our country.&quot; After her interview, she stated, &quot;When I do interviews with Larry King or the big TV shows like that, they put you on the spot, which is very difficult. I do have an opinion, but I&#x27;m a singer. I&#x27;m not a politician.&quot;

=== Voice and timbre ===

In discussions of opera projects, Dion said she was a mezzo-soprano. However, attempts to adapt classical voice types to other forms of singing have been met with controversy. Kent Nagano, maestro of the Munich Symphony Orchestra, remarked, &quot;All you just sang was soprano&quot;, after Dion auditioned with two solos from &quot;Carmen&quot;, wanting to know if she could sing opera. Her timbre has been described as &quot;thin, slightly nasal&quot; with a &quot;raspy&quot; lower register and &quot;bell glass-like high notes&quot;.

According to Linda Lister in &quot;Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars&quot;, she has been described as a reigning &quot;Queen of Pop&quot; for her influence over the recording industry during the 1990s, alongside other female artists, including Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. In a countdown of the &quot;22 Greatest Voices in Music&quot; by &quot;Blender Magazine&quot; and MTV, she placed ninth (sixth for a female), and she was also placed fourth in &quot;Cover Magazine&quot; list of &quot;The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists&quot;. MTV Australia ranked Dion at fourth place in their list of Top 10 music divas of all time. Dion is often compared to Houston and Carey for her vocal style, and to her idol Barbra Streisand for her voice.

She is often praised for her technical virtuosity. Jim Santella of &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; writes &quot;Like an iron fist in a velvet glove, the power of Celine Dion&#x27;s voice is cloaked in a silky vibrato that betrays the intensity of her vocal commitment.&quot; Jeff Miers, also of &quot;The Buffalo News&quot;, says of Dion &quot;Her singing voice is absolutely extra-human. She hits notes in full voice, with a controlled vibrato and an incredible conception of pitch, like she&#x27;s shucking an ear of corn.&quot; Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; states that Dion has &quot;a good-sized arsenal of technical skills. She can deliver tricky melismas, produce expressive vocal catches and sustain long notes without the tiniest wavering of pitch. And as her duets ... have shown, she is a reliable harmony voice.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Libération&quot;, Jean-Jacques Goldman notes that she has &quot;no problem of accuracy or tempo&quot;. According to Kent Nagano, she is &quot;a musician who has a good ear, a refinement, and a degree of perfection that is enviable&quot;. Charles Alexander of &quot;Time&quot; states, &quot;[Her] voice glides effortlessly from deep whispers to dead-on high notes, a sweet siren that combines force with grace.&quot;

In her French repertoire, Dion adorns her vocals with more nuances and expressiveness, with the emotional intensity being &quot;more tender and intimate&quot;. Additionally, Luc Plamondon, a French singer-songwriter who has worked closely with Dion claims that there are three chanteuses (stylistically) that she uses: the Québécois, the French, and the American. Her self-titled 1992 album was promoted with the slogan &quot;Remember the name because you&#x27;ll never forget the voice.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Dion is credited for introducing Francophone music to many non-Francophone countries around the globe. &quot;RFI Musique&quot; opined that French music &quot;would probably never have got beyond Francophone borders without her&quot; She has also been credited with revitalizing and revolutionizing the entertainment scene in Las Vegas with the gargantuan successes of her residencies there. She signed a $100 million contract for a residency in Vegas, which is considered one of the most lucrative and risky residency contracts in the touring industry. Dion is popularly referred as the reigning &quot;Queen of Las Vegas&quot; by various media outlets for her impact and legacy in the city. Celine Dion has received various acclaims from fashion critics for reinventing her fashion style over the years. &quot;Vogue&quot; named her as one of music&#x27;s most exuberant dressers, beloved as much for her glorious voice as her extravagant sense of style. Since her career&#x27;s inception in 1981, Dion has been cited as an influence by various music artists all over the world, as well as one of the greaest vocalists of all-time. According to producer, musician, and former &quot;American Idol&quot; judge Randy Jackson, Dion, Houston, and Carey are the voices of the modern era.

Dion has been the subject of various tribute projects around the world, including a jukebox musical &quot;Titanique&quot;, which is a retelling of the events from the 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot; from the perspective of Dion, and a musical comedy biopic titled &quot;Aline&quot;. Dion has also been the subject of numerous drag queens in their performance, and she has been referenced in music and films. Jazz vocalist Ranee Lee released an album titled &quot;&quot;Because You Loved Me&quot;,&quot; covering some of Dion&#x27;s biggest songs.

According to Innee-Sedona International, the Asia partner for Bugatti Group said that it already topped $10 million sales after just three collections.

Dion became an entrepreneur with the establishment of her franchise restaurant &quot;Nickels&quot; in 1990. She has since divested her interests in the chain and is no longer affiliated with &quot;Nickels&quot;, as of 1997. In 2003, Dion signed a deal with Coty to release &quot;Celine Dion Parfums&quot;.

=== Philanthropy ===
Dion has actively supported many charity organizations, worldwide. She has promoted the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CCFF) since 1982, and became the foundation&#x27;s National Celebrity Patron in 1993. She has an emotional attachment to the foundation; her niece Karine died from the disease at the age of sixteen, in Dion&#x27;s arms. In 2003, she joined a number of other celebrities, athletes, and politicians, including Josh Groban and Yolanda Adams, to support &quot;World Children&#x27;s Day&quot;, a global fundraising effort sponsored by McDonald&#x27;s.

Martell Foundation, the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, and many health and educational campaigns. During the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, she donated $1 million to the victims of the storm, and held a fund-raising event for the victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami, which subsequently raised more than $1 million.

== Personal life ==

=== Relationships and family ===
Dion first met René Angélil, her future husband and manager, in 1980, when she was 12 and he was 38, after her brother, Michel Dondalinger Dion, had sent him a demonstration recording of &quot;Ce n&#x27;était qu&#x27;un rêve&quot; (&quot;It Was Only a Dream/Nothing but a Dream&quot;), a song she, her mother Thérèse, and her brother Jacques Dion had jointly written. Over subsequent years, Angélil guided her to stardom in Francophone territories.

After the dissolution (around 1985) of Angélil&#x27;s second marriage (to Canadian singer Anne Renée), he and Dion took a break from each other professionally, and he spent a major part of the year in Las Vegas, while Dion was learning English and taking dance and vocal lessons in Montreal. Upon his return, &quot;he avoided being alone with me for too long a time&quot;, she said in her 2000 autobiography &quot;My Story, My Dream&quot;. Meanwhile, she kept a photo of Angélil under her pillow, later writing, &quot;Before I fell asleep, I slipped it under the pillow, out of fear that my mother, who always shared a room with me, would find it.&quot; She also wrote, &quot;Less and less could I hide from myself the fact that I was in love with René; I had all the symptoms,&quot; and &quot;I was in love with a man I couldn&#x27;t love, who didn&#x27;t want me to love him, who didn&#x27;t want to love me.&quot; Dion&#x27;s mother, who traveled everywhere with her until she was 19, was initially wary of her growing infatuation with a much older and twice-divorced Angélil, but Dion was insistent, telling her mother &quot;I&#x27;m not a minor. This is a free country. No one has the right to prevent me from loving whoever I want to.&quot;

Their professional relationship eventually turned romantic after Dion&#x27;s win at the Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin in 1988, when she was 20. The romance was known to only family and friends for five years, though Dion nearly revealed it in a tearful 1992 interview with journalist Lise Payette. Many years later, Payette penned the song &quot;Je cherche l&#x27;ombre&quot; for Dion&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;D&#x27;elles&quot;. Dion and Angélil became engaged on 30 March 1993, which was Dion&#x27;s 25th birthday, and made their relationship public in the liner notes of her 1993 album &quot;The Colour of My Love&quot;. They married on 17 December 1994, at Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal, Quebec. On 5 January 2000, Dion and Angélil renewed their wedding vows in Las Vegas.

In May 2000, Dion had two small operations at a fertility clinic in New York to improve her chances of conceiving, after deciding to use in vitro fertilization because of years of failed attempts to conceive. Their first son, René-Charles Angélil, was born on 25 January 2001. Dion suffered a miscarriage in 2009. In May 2010, Dion announced that she was 14 weeks pregnant with twins after a sixth treatment of in vitro fertilization. On Saturday, 23 October 2010, at 11:11 and 11:12 am respectively, Dion gave birth to fraternal twins by Caesarean section at St. Mary&#x27;s Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Florida. The twins were named Eddy, after Dion&#x27;s favourite French songwriter, Eddy Marnay, who had also produced her first five albums; and Nelson, after former South African president Nelson Mandela. She appeared with her newborn sons on the cover of 9 December 2010 issue of the Canadian edition of &quot;Hello!&quot; magazine.

On 14 January 2016, Angélil died at age 73 of throat cancer. His funeral was held on 22 January 2016, in Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal, where he and Dion wed 21 years earlier. The couple&#x27;s eldest son René-Charles gave the eulogy, three days before his 15th birthday. Following Angélil&#x27;s death, Dion became the sole owner and president of her management and production companies, including CDA Productions and Les Productions Feeling. Two days after Angélil&#x27;s deathon what would have been her husband&#x27;s birthdayone of Dion&#x27;s brothers, Daniel, died at age 59, also of cancer.

=== Health ===
On 22 March 2018, Dion&#x27;s management team announced that she had been dealing with hearing irregularities for the previous 12 to 18 months due to patulous Eustachian tube and would undergo a minimally invasive surgical procedure to correct the problem after ear-drop medications appeared to be no longer working.

Owing to her slight frame, Dion has been subject to eating disorder rumors for decades, which she has consistently denied: &quot;I don&#x27;t have an eating problem, and there&#x27;s nothing more I can say about it&quot;; &quot;My work requires me to be in great physical shape. I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to give up to a hundred shows a year and travel ceaselessly from one end of the world to the other if I had eaten too much or not enough, or if, as certain magazines have claimed, I made myself throw up after each meal.&quot; She has often spoken about having been bullied at school and lacking confidence in her early years in the business: &quot;I didn&#x27;t have, visually, what it took. I was not pretty, I had teeth problems, and I was very skinny. I didn&#x27;t fit the mold&quot;. Dion took up ballet under the guidance of her former dancer, Naomi Stikeman, who also previously performed for The National Ballet of Canada and La La La Human Steps, and former Cirque du Soleil dancer-turned-fashion-illustrator, Pepe Muñoz, who is also part of her styling team. She is also a skier and a regular at her son René-Charles&#x27; hockey games.

In December 2022, Dion disclosed that she had been diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome, a neurological disorder affecting her muscles. In June 2024, Dion publicly disclosed in a &quot;People&quot; magazine cover story that she had struggled with a variety of mysterious symptoms for 17 years before her August 2022 diagnosis. It was also concurrently revealed that for two years, Dion had been under the care of Dr. Amanda Piquet, a specialist in autoimmune neurology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado, and that Dion&#x27;s charitable foundation was donating $2 million to the Anschutz Medical Campus to support autoimmune neurology research for five years. Dion explained that with the help of Dr. Piquet and other experts, she was already preparing to return to the stage: &quot;My voice is being rebuilt as we speak, right now.&quot;

=== Wealth ===

In 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported that Dion had a net worth of US$550 million, getting her to no. 59 on the magazine&#x27;s list of America&#x27;s Richest Self-Made Women. In 2023, Dion sold her Summerlin, Nevada house for US$30 million. She previously owned a home on a private island in Montreal, which she sold for US$25.5 million in 2019. In 2017, Dion sold her Jupiter Island, Florida home for US$38.5 million After the death of her mother in 2020, Dion listed her mother&#x27;s Laval home for US$1.785 million. As of 2024, Dion resides in a house in Henderson, Nevada, which was reportedly purchased for US$1.5 million in 2003 and as of 2024 was now closer to US$4.5 million in value after renovations.

<text>Robert E. Connick (July 29, 1917 – August 21, 2014) was a professor emeritus of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.

==Life==
Connick studied chemistry at Berkeley, receiving his B.S. in 1939 and his Ph.D. in 1942. He was a research associate on the Manhattan Project from 1943 - 1946, and has been a professor, chair of the chemistry department, dean of the college of chemistry, vice chancellor, and chair of the academic senate at both Berkeley and the entire University of California system.

His research led to growth and improvement in inorganic reaction kinetics and mechanisms. He is most known for development of nuclear magnetic resonance methods for determining rates of water exchange reactions. During his time with the Manhattan Project, Connick contributed research to the fundamental chemical properties of plutonium, during a time when only minute amounts were accessible, and helped devise its separation techniques. Connick’s studies revealed plutonium’s complicated oxidation-reduction properties and the existence of many ions. The results showed scientific basis for the various practical separation processes developed during and since World War II.

He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1963. 
He was a 1968 G.N. Lewis Lecturer and Awardee.
He was a two-time Guggenheim Fellow, in 1948 and 1958. Connick also served as a Counselor for the Save the Redwoods League. Connick died at the age of 97 in 2014.

<text>Robert Gerson Shulman (born March 3, 1924) is an American biophysicist and Sterling Professor Emeritus of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry and a senior research scientist at the Department Diagnostic Radiology at Yale University.

==Early life and education==
Shulman was born in New York City and in 1943. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Columbia University where he majored in chemistry and studied literature with Lionel Trilling, who encouraged Shulman&#x27;s life-long interest in the humanities. 

After graduating, Shulman joined the United States Navy Reserve. He served in the Pacific during the last days of World War II as a Lt,jg USNR on the USS Saratoga. After the war he entered Columbia as a graduate student. His war time work with radar brought him to the lab of Charles H. Townes, who was working with microwave spectroscopy. In a 2019 oral history, Shulman said:

Shulman received his Ph.D. in chemistry at Columbia in 1949. 

== Career ==
From 1949 to 1950 was a fellow at California Institute of Technology (CalTech). There he met Alexander Rich, his roommate, who worked with Linus Pauling.

After this postdoc year, Shulman took a job at Howard Hughes&#x27; Hughes Aircraft Company, working with Harper Q. North who was running the company&#x27;s semi-conductor program as part of the research group producing the Hughes Germanium Diodes, which were marketed as &quot;Fusion-sealed in a glass.&quot; In 1953, he joined the physics research department at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., where he began research on the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in condensed matter physics particularly studying magnetic materials like paramagnetic fluorides where he defined the covalent bonds and the exchange reactions responsible for their antiferromagnetism in these primarily ionic compounds. Eventually he became interested in Russian claims that DNA was a magnetic material which he showed were mistaken. In 1961 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship to study abroad as a visiting Professor of Physics at the École normale supérieure in Paris which, because his interests had shifted to biological materials, he transferred, with the blessing of the Guggenheim, to the Laboratory for Molecular Biology in University of Cambridge. &quot;There was all sorts of speculation about DNA,&quot; he said while still at Bell Labs &quot;so I went back to Alex Rich, who was by then an established biologist. I said, &#x27;I&#x27;d like to go into biology, where should I go on my sabbatical?&#x27; The answer was &#x27;Go work with Francis Crick if you can.&#x27;&quot;
In 1961–1962, he worked with Crick and Sidney Brenner in Cambridge, &quot;in the old courtyard of the Cavendish Lab&quot;, helping to put &quot;the finishing touches to Crick’s hypothesis as to how the DNA code was read for synthesizing proteins&quot;.

At Cambridge talking about what experiments to do next about how the genetic code was read, Francis walked around saying, &quot;I feel as if at any minute the whole hypothesis is going to go down the drain. We&#x27;ll do an experiment and it will disprove it all, and we&#x27;ll be left with nothing.&quot; &quot;I feel it every day I come in here, frightened by that.&quot; And that was such a wonderful thing to have heard about science. ...&quot;I realize this is a hypothesis. We’re doing experiments that support the hypothesis, and it gives us confidence that the hypothesis is an accurate description of the world, some part of the world. But it&#x27;s a hypothesis and we must never forget that. There was timidity, tentativeness in Francis&#x27;s attitude towards scientific results, in that despite the success of his creative hypotheses he remained open to any results that will disprove it. And so it was really a lovely illustration of what science could be.&quot; (2019 Oral History). Another day Francis, in a discussion, said we could do Sidney&#x27;s experiment which meant trying to experimentally identify chain terminators in the DNA which I volunteered to do and with guidance from Leslie Barnett managed to accomplish. But instead of continuing in Molecular Biology I was more interested in charting new directions for biological NMR and returned to Bell Labs to follow NMR and other spectroscopic studies of biological materials and organisms. With Terry Eisinger and Bill Blumberg I built up a group of young scientists which eventually became the Biophysical Research Department. Over several decades, we pioneered in the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), other forms of spectroscopy and EXAFS to study biochemical processes. The research soon focused on non-invasive nuclear magnetic resonance studies in vivo of humans and animals

A propos of the direction he took on returning to Bell Labs, Dr. Shulman said,

(2019 Oral History). They extended NMR in vivo and filled many important positions in academia, industry and governmental History)

Dr. Shulman joined the faculty at Yale University in 1979. He was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1962. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Institute of Medicine.
To the surprise of his new colleagues, he left the study of biomolecular structure in favor of in vivo pathways. 

==Personal life==
He is married to Stephanie S. Spangler, and has two surviving sons.

<text>The Lizzie McGuire Movie is a 2003 American teen comedy film directed by Jim Fall. The film serves as the finale of the Disney Channel television series &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; and was the first theatrical film based on a Disney Channel series. The film stars Hilary Duff, Adam Lamberg, Robert Carradine, Hallie Todd and Jake Thomas, and the story follows Lizzie and her classmates on a graduation trip to Rome, where she gets mistaken for an Italian pop star and embarks on an unexpected adventure. It was released on May 2, 2003, by Buena Vista Pictures, peaking at number two at the domestic box office behind &quot;X2&quot;. It received mixed reviews from critics but gained a strong cult following in later years. The events of the film take place after the second and final season of &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;.

==Plot==
Lizzie McGuire prepares for her junior-high graduation with one of her two closest friends, David &quot;Gordo&quot; Gordon. Their other best friend, Miranda Sanchez, has chosen to skip the graduation ceremony in favor of a trip to Mexico City to visit her relatives. During the ceremony, Lizzie trips onstage and accidentally brings the curtain down on her fellow graduates; this causes her to be teased by her younger brother Matt and her former best friend Kate Sanders.

After graduation, Lizzie and her classmates embark on a trip to Rome, chaperoned by their future strict high school principal, Angela Ungermeyer. The rest of the class chose a trip to a water park instead. To their dismay, Lizzie and Kate are assigned to the same hotel room. Their class visits the Trevi Fountain, where Lizzie is approached by an Italian pop star named Paolo Valisari, who mistakes her for his singing partner, Isabella Parigi. He asks Lizzie to meet him at the fountain the next day, and she feigns illness to sneak away.

Paolo explains that he and Isabella are booked for the International Music Video Awards, but she left Italy after their partnership breakup. He tells Lizzie that Isabella lip syncs and begs her to pose as her for the ceremony so that they won&#x27;t be fined for canceling. Lizzie reluctantly agrees but soon begins to enjoy the experience and falls for Paolo. Lizzie continues to fake being ill to prepare for the ceremony, but Kate quickly figures out her secret. To Lizzie&#x27;s surprise, she agrees to help her and they become friendly again. Meanwhile, Ms. Ungermeyer grows suspicious, leading Gordo to take the blame and results in him being sent back home as punishment. Lizzie is shocked when she learns from Kate that Gordo sacrificed himself to protect her.

Back home, Matt finds Italian gossip sites with pictures of Lizzie as Isabella. He initially tells his parents he misses Lizzie, convincing his parents to fly them to Rome, during which his parents find out about Lizzie&#x27;s exploits. At the airport, Gordo meets the real Isabella, who is upset that someone has been impersonating her. They realize that Paolo is planning to have a nervous Lizzie unknowingly sing live at the ceremony, as Isabella actually does, creating the impression that Isabella is a fake, which would damage the latter&#x27;s career and embarrass Lizzie. Gordo and Isabella rush to the awards to stop him and warn Lizzie. When the McGuires arrive in Rome, Ms. Ungermeyer learns that Lizzie is missing. Gordo&#x27;s roommate Ethan Craft reveals that she is performing at the International Music Video Awards, and Lizzie&#x27;s family and the class also rush to the ceremony.

Backstage, Gordo and Isabella find Lizzie preparing for the ceremony and warn her about Paolo&#x27;s scheme. She refuses to believe them at first, but Isabella convinces her otherwise. Ms. Ungermeyer gets the class and Lizzie&#x27;s family into the ceremony by pushing her way through the bouncers. During the performance, Isabella and Gordo expose Paolo, who is actually the one who lip syncs, by turning on his microphone, revealing his real mediocre singing voice. Upset, he runs off stage, where his displeased manager Sergei resigns, and gets ambushed outside by paparazzi. Isabella introduces Lizzie to the crowd, and the two of them sing &quot;What Dreams Are Made Of&quot;.

When Isabella leaves the stage, Lizzie finishes the song solo, displaying a newfound confidence. Later, they all celebrate at the hotel&#x27;s after party, where Ms. Ungermeyer rescinds Gordo&#x27;s punishment and flirts with Sergei. Although Lizzie&#x27;s parents tell her she is grounded for the rest of the summer, they are still proud of her. Lizzie and Gordo sneak away from the party to go up to the roof, where they promise to never let things change between them. They kiss and then rejoin the party before they get into more trouble. As the film ends with fireworks spelling &quot;The End&quot;, the animated Lizzie does a parody of Tinker Bell, winking at the audience.

==Production==
The film, produced by Stan Rogow, was directed by Jim Fall from a screenplay by Susan Estelle Jansen, Ed Decter and John J. Strauss. It was filmed on location in Rome, Italy in the fall of 2002, with some additional scenes shot in Vancouver, Canada. Most of the series characters reprised their roles except for Lalaine (Miranda Sanchez), who left the series late in the second season to film the Disney Channel original movie &quot;You Wish!&quot;. Her character was said to be on vacation with her family in Mexico City. Additionally, the characters Claire Miller, Larry Tudgeman, and Lanny Onassis were absent from the film.

Fall, an openly gay filmmaker, had previously directed the R-rated film &quot;Trick&quot;, after which he began pitching and searching gay-related projects in Hollywood. He found that the script for &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot; had some similarities with this earlier film: &quot;Both movies end in a kiss, both movies have musical numbers, [and] both movies have cute boys.&quot; Disney wanted the film to feel and look different from the show it is based on, and supported many of Fall&#x27;s ideas, including the suggestion to shoot in widescreen.

New York&#x27;s Tapehouse Toons again handled the animation sequences involving Lizzie&#x27;s cartoon alter ego, just like in the television show. This marked their first time working on a feature film, after being approached by Disney, who normally handled these type of projects at their in-house animation studio. Tapehouse had to hire 15 additional people for the task of completing the film, thus expanding their &quot;core group&quot; of five employees.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 40% based on 102 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus calls the film: &quot;A harmless piece of fluff that ought to satisfy fans of the TV show.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100 based on 28 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Scott Brown of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a B+: &quot;Let&#x27;s face it: Lizzie McGuire (Hilary Duff) is just too darn polished to be a junior-high underdog, even by the standards of her &#x27;luxe suburban environs&#x27;. But that hasn&#x27;t tarnished her comeback-kid cred among the six-and-ups who faithfully follow her Disney Channel show—and it doesn&#x27;t make &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot;, a clever, agreeably weightless theatrical outing, any less enjoyable.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, but praised Borstein&#x27;s performance, calling her work &quot;the only really delightful element in the movie; everything else is simply slick and professional.&quot;

===Box office===
In its opening weekend the film grossed $17.3 million in 2,825 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking second behind &quot;X2: X-Men United&quot;. &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot; grossed $42.7 million domestically and $12.8 million internationally for a worldwide total of $55.5 million.

===Awards===
* 2003 (won): Kids&#x27; Choice Award for Movie Breakout Star, Female (Hilary Duff)
* 2003 (won): Teen Choice Award for Movie Breakout Star, Female (Hilary Duff)
* 2003 (nominated): Teen Choice Awards for Movie Comedy, Movie Comedy Actress (Hilary Duff)
* 2004 (nominated): Leo Award for Feature-Length Drama: Best Visual Effects (Gary Gutierrez, Jayne Craig, Bruce Woloshyn, Simon Ager and Wes Sargent)

==Soundtrack==
==Home media==
The film was released on DVD and VHS on August 12, 2003. The video sold 2,90 million copies earning a profit of over 50.5 million dollars. It is also included on Disney&#x27;s streaming service, Disney+.

==Cancelled sequel==
Following the release of the film, there were plans to continue the &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; series, one of which included a planned sequel film. This was ultimately shelved due to creative differences with Duff and Disney. In August 2019, it was announced that a &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; revival would be entering production for Disney+, with Duff reprising her role and Minsky returning as showrunner. Lamberg, Thomas, Todd and Carradine would also return to the series in their original roles. The series began production in association with Disney Channel, but entered a hiatus after Minsky&#x27;s departure and did not resume. It was later cancelled in December 2020.

<text>Robert Benedict Browder (born December 11, 1962) is an American actor, writer and film director, known for his roles as John Crichton in &quot;Farscape&quot; and Cameron Mitchell in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Browder grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina. His parents were race car owners and operators. He attended Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, and graduated with a degree in psychology. He was a star player on the Furman football team. Browder met his wife, actress Francesca Buller, while studying at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London.

==Career==
Browder appeared as a recurring guest on the U.S. television show &quot;Party of Five&quot; as Sam Brody in its 3rd season in 1997. Browder and Buller moved with their two children to Australia during the production of &quot;Farscape&quot; (1999–2003), on which Browder starred as American astronaut John Crichton. Buller played several guest roles on the show. The two returned to the United States in 2003 following the cancellation of &quot;Farscape&quot;. He has received two Saturn Awards for Best Actor in a Television Role for his acting in &quot;Farscape&quot;. He appeared in the 2004 film &quot;A Killer Within&quot;, co-starring C. Thomas Howell and Sean Young. Also in 2004, he portrayed fellow actor Lee Majors in the television film &quot;Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;.
He returned to play John Crichton in the 2004 SciFi Channel miniseries &quot;&quot;. The miniseries wrapped up the remaining plotlines of &quot;Farscape&quot;, while leaving open the possibility of future adventures.

October 2003 marked the audiobook release of &quot;Interlopers&quot;, a novel written by Alan Dean Foster and narrated by Browder.

In January 2005, Browder voiced the character Bartholomew Aloysius &quot;Bat&quot; Lash in an episode of the animated series &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; entitled &quot;The Once and Future Thing, Part 1: Weird Western Tales&quot;.

Browder returned to the SciFi Channel as he joined the cast of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; for its ninth season in 2005. He played the character of Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell, the new commanding officer of SG-1. Browder&#x27;s former &quot;Farscape&quot; co-star Claudia Black appeared on &quot;SG-1&quot; in the eighth-season episode entitled &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; and again during the first episodes of the ninth season before becoming a regular cast member on the series at the beginning of its tenth season in 2006. Several episodes of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, most notably &quot;200&quot;, comically alluded to &quot;Farscape&quot; during Browder and Black&#x27;s time on the series. In addition to being a series regular on Stargate SG-1, Browder also performed many of his own stunts.

In 2012, Browder was cast in a series 7 episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;A Town Called Mercy&quot;. It was filmed in Almeria, Spain, in March 2012.

Browder played the role of Max the Janitor in the 2012 live-action feature film &quot;Bad Kids Go to Hell&quot;, based on the graphic novel of the same name. He reprised the role and made his directorial debut in the 2017 sequel &quot;Bad Kids of Crestview Academy&quot;.

<text>Amanda Laura Bynes (born April 3, 1986) is an American actress. Bynes began her career as a child, appearing on the Nickelodeon sketch comedy series &quot;All That&quot; (1996–2000) and its spin-off series &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; (1999–2002). During her mid-teens, she played Holly Tyler on the WB sitcom &quot;What I Like About You&quot; (2002–2006) and starred in the teen comedy films &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; (2002) and &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; (2003). As an adult, she appeared in the films &quot;She&#x27;s the Man&quot; (2006), &quot;Hairspray&quot; (2007), and &quot;Easy A&quot; (2010).

Bynes is heralded for her acting work in the 1990s and 2000s, winning a Critics&#x27; Choice Award and six Kids&#x27; Choice Awards among other accolades. In her highly publicized personal life, she has struggled with mental health and other issues, and was in a conservatorship from August 2013 to March 2022.

==Early life==
Bynes was born and raised on April 3, 1986, in Thousand Oaks, California, a suburb of Los Angeles.

She is the youngest of three children born to Lynn (née Organ), a dental assistant and office manager, and Rick Bynes, a dentist.

Her father is Catholic and is of Irish, Lithuanian, and Polish descent.

Her mother is Jewish, born to a Canadian couple whose families were from Poland, Russia, and Romania.

==Career==

=== 1993–2005: Child acting and breakthrough ===

Bynes began professionally acting at age seven, appearing in a television advertisements for Buncha Crunch candies, Cut and Style Barbie, and Taco Bell. During her childhood, she also appeared on stage in versions of &quot;Annie&quot;, &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, &quot;The Music Man&quot;, and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. Later she attended a comedy camp at the Los Angeles Laugh Factory, at which she received advice from Richard Pryor and Arsenio Hall. A Nickelodeon producer spotted her at a performance at the Laugh Factory, which prompted the network to cast her on the sketch comedy series &quot;All That&quot;, where she played various roles from season three to season six. The show brought Bynes considerable recognition, and she won a Kids&#x27; Choice Award in 2000. Bynes was also a regular member of the series &quot;Figure It Out&quot; from 1997 to 1999.

At the age of 13, Bynes starred in the &quot;All That&quot; spin-off comedy &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; from 1999 to 2002. She had her breakthrough on the show, earning praise and acclaim. She won four Kids&#x27; Choice Awards and received two Young Artist Award nominations. In 2002, Bynes made her feature film debut in &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; starring as Kaylee, best friend of co-star Frankie Muniz&#x27;s character. Although the film had a mixed reception, it was a commercial success, and she won another Kids&#x27; Choice Award for her performance. Also in 2002, she landed a starring role in the WB sitcom &quot;What I Like About You&quot; from 2002 to 2006, co-starring with Jennie Garth. The series garnered positive reviews and Bynes received a number of nominations from the Teen Choice Awards and the Young Artist Awards.

In 2003, Bynes appeared on the cover of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; July 2003 edition. She had a voice role in the direct-to-video film &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web 2: Wilbur&#x27;s Great Adventure&quot;, which was panned by critics. She also had a voice role as Piper Pinwheeler in the 2005 animated film &quot;Robots&quot;, which was a commercial success. Also in 2005, she starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Love Wrecked&quot;.

=== 2006–2010: Mainstream stardom and hiatus ===
Bynes was named one of &quot;Teen People&quot;″s &quot;25 Hottest Stars Under 25&quot; in 2006. In 2006, Bynes starred in the teen sports romantic comedy film &quot;She&#x27;s the Man&quot;, based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night.&quot; She portrays Viola Hastings, a girl who pretends to be her twin brother to play with the boys&#x27; soccer team at an elite boarding school after the girls soccer team at her school gets cut. Critic Roger Ebert wrote &quot;Of Amanda Bynes let us say that she is sunny and plucky and somehow finds a way to play her impossible role without clearing her throat more than six or eight times. More importantly, we like her.&quot;

In 2007, Bynes starred as Penny Pingleton, a sheltered young girl, in the musical comedy film &quot;Hairspray&quot;, based on the musical theater adaptation of John Waters&#x27; 1988 film. The film was a critical and commercial success premiering in over 3,000 theaters, the largest debut for any musical film. It went on to become Bynes&#x27;s most successful film at the time, and she and the rest of the cast were acclaimed for their performances. She won the Critics&#x27; Choice Award for Best Acting Ensemble and received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination in 2008, among others. She was also featured on the &quot;Hairspray&quot; soundtrack, which went on to get a Grammy nomination. It was announced Bynes would reprise her role in &quot;Hairspray 2&quot;, but the project was canceled. In August 2007, Bynes teamed up with Steve &amp; Barry&#x27;s to create her own fashion line called Dear, consisting of apparel and accessories. The line was cut short when Steve &amp; Barry&#x27;s filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2008.

Bynes&#x27; next role was in another comedy, &quot;Sydney White&quot;, released in 2007. The film was a critical and commercial failure, although Bynes&#x27; performance was praised. Review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes wrote &quot;Amanda Bynes is charming, but &quot;Sydney White&quot; is a poorly adapted take on &quot;Snow White&quot;, relying on tired ethnic stereotypes laughs.&quot; In 2008, she appeared in the Lifetime Television movie &quot;Living Proof&quot; as the student assistant of Harry Connick, Jr.&#x27;s character. The film and the cast were praised. Also in 2008, Bynes voiced Anna in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Long John Peter&quot;.

In 2009, she was set to star in the comedy &quot;Post Grad&quot;, but she dropped out and was replaced by Alexis Bledel amid rumors that she was having difficulties. In 2010, Bynes co-starred alongside the then-relatively unknown Emma Stone in the comedy &quot;Easy A&quot;. She starred as Marianne Bryant, the president of a high school Bible study club who becomes the personal nemesis of Stone&#x27;s character. The film was a critical and commercial success, with Stone and Bynes receiving critical praise for their performances. In the same year, Bynes started shooting the Farrelly Brothers comedy film &quot;Hall Pass&quot;, but dropped out of the film and was replaced by Alexandra Daddario. In July 2010, Bynes announced an indefinite hiatus from acting.

In 2018, Bynes considered returning to acting, but nothing happened at that time. She was going to reunite with former &quot;All That&quot; cast members at &#x27;90s Con in March 2023, her first public appearance since the end of her conservatorship, but she did not attend due to illness. In December 2023, Bynes debuted as the co-host of an interview-style podcast, &quot;Amanda Bynes &amp; Paul Sieminski: The Podcast&quot;, but she left after one episode to &quot;get [her] manicurist license and have a consistent job&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2007, Bynes described herself as Jewish and said: &quot;As far as religion, I was raised both. I learned about both [Judaism and Catholicism]. My parents said it was up to me to decide when I grew up. I&#x27;m sort of a spiritual person anyway. I haven&#x27;t decided yet. I don&#x27;t know yet exactly what I believe.&quot;

In 2008, Bynes briefly dated Seth MacFarlane after voicing a character in an episode of MacFarlane&#x27;s show &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

Since childhood, Bynes has been interested in illustration and fashion design. In December 2013, Bynes enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising (FIDM) in Irvine, California for 2014. In 2018, she received her associate&#x27;s of art degree in merchandise product development and announced her intentions to start a bachelor&#x27;s degree program. In 2019, Bynes graduated from FIDM.

===Mental health and substance abuse problems===
In 2012, Bynes was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) in West Hollywood. She accepted a plea bargain of three years probation in exchange for the dismissal of the DUI charge. In May 2013, Bynes was charged with reckless endangerment and marijuana possession after she was found smoking in the lobby of her Manhattan apartment building. When officers entered her 36th-floor apartment, she allegedly threw a bong out the window. A New York County judge dismissed the case against her in June 2014.

In July 2013, Ventura County, California sheriff&#x27;s deputies detained her after she allegedly started a small fire in the driveway of a stranger in Thousand Oaks. She was hospitalized under a 72-hour mental-health evaluation hold. Bynes&#x27;s parents filed for conservatorship of their daughter shortly after her hospitalization began. In August, Bynes&#x27; mother was granted a temporary conservatorship over Bynes&#x27;s affairs.

In October 2014, Bynes accused her father of emotional and sexual abuse in a series of tweets; after her parents protested and claimed innocence, Bynes tweeted that her father had never abused her, adding: &quot;The microchip in my brain made me say those things but he&#x27;s the one that ordered them to microchip me&quot;. Days later, Bynes&#x27; mother again received conservatorship of her. Soon afterward, Bynes announced that she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In August 2018, paperwork was filed to continue the conservatorship until August 2020.

In 2018, Bynes stated she had been sober for four years with the help of her parents. She also apologized for what she said on Twitter during her years of substance abuse: &quot;I&#x27;m really ashamed and embarrassed with the things I said. I can&#x27;t turn back time but if I could, I would. And I&#x27;m so sorry to whoever I hurt and whoever I lied about because it truly eats away at me.&quot; In an interview, Bynes stated that during her days of substance abuse she experimented with cocaine and MDMA, but the drug she &quot;abused the most&quot; was the ADHD prescription medication Adderall.
In February 2022, Bynes filed to end her conservatorship. Her attorney stated that Bynes believed her condition was improved and protection of the court was no longer necessary. Attorneys for her parents stated that they supported her in ending it. The conservatorship was officially terminated on March 22, 2022.

On March 20, 2023, Bynes was placed on a 72-hour psychiatric hold after she flagged a bystander for help and called 911 following a psychotic episode in Los Angeles. The previous weekend she had been scheduled to appear at an &quot;All That&quot; panel at &#x27;90s Con in Connecticut, her first scheduled public event since the end of her conservatorship, but she did not appear. On June 17, 2023, after she called the police indicating that she had thoughts of self-harm, mental health professionals determined that she needed inpatient treatment. She left the facility on June 30 with plans for follow-up outpatient treatment.

<text>Nyasaland () was a British protectorate in Africa that was established in 1907 when the former British Central Africa Protectorate changed its name. Between 1953 and 1963, Nyasaland was part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. After the Federation was dissolved, Nyasaland became independent from Britain on 6 July 1964 and was renamed Malawi.

Nyasaland&#x27;s history was marked by the massive loss of African communal lands in the early colonial period. In January 1915, the Reverend John Chilembwe staged an attempted rebellion to protest against colonial forced labour and discrimination against Africans, among other grievances. Although the rebellion was unsuccessful, colonial authorities responded by reassessing some of their policies. Throughout the 1930s, a growing class of educated African elite, many educated in the United Kingdom, became increasingly politically active and vocal about gaining independence. They established associations and, after 1944, the Nyasaland African Congress (NAC).

When Nyasaland became part of a federation with Southern and Northern Rhodesia in 1953, there was a rise in civic unrest, as this was deeply unpopular among the people of the territory. The failure of the NAC to prevent this caused its collapse. Soon, a younger and more militant generation revived the NAC. They invited Hastings Banda to return to the country and lead it to independence as Malawi in 1964.

==Historic population==
The 1911 census was the first after the protectorate was renamed as Nyasaland. The population according to this census was: Africans, classed as &quot;natives&quot;: 969,183, Europeans 766, Asians 481. In March 1920, Europeans numbered 1,015 and Asians 515. In 1919, the number of Africans was estimated at 561,600 males and 664,400 females, a total of 1,226,000. Blantyre, the chief town, had some 300 European residents. The number of resident Europeans was always small (only 1,948 in 1945). By 1960 their numbers rose to about 9,500, but they declined afterward following the struggle for independence. The number of ethnic Asian residents, many of whom were traders and merchants, was also small.

The category of &#x27;native&#x27; was large, but there was no general definition of the term. In a Nyasaland court case in 1929, the judge opined that, &quot;A native means a native of Africa who is not of European or Asiatic race or origin; all others are non-natives. A person&#x27;s race or origin does not depend on where he or she is born. Race depends on the blood in one&#x27;s veins ...&quot;. Unlike Europeans of British origin, Nyasaland natives did not hold British citizenship under British nationality law, but had the lesser status of British protected person. The term &#x27;native&#x27; was used in all colonial censuses up to and including 1945.

Census data from colonial censuses and the first census after independence in the table below show a population that increased quite rapidly. The &quot;de facto&quot; populations count those who are resident; the &quot;de jure&quot; populations include absent migrant workers who gave addresses in Malawi as their permanent home.

Source: &quot;Final Report of the 1966 Census of Malawi,&quot; Zomba, 1968.

The colonial censuses were imprecise: those of 1901 and 1911 estimated the African population based on hut tax records, and adult male tax defaulters (up to 10% of the total) went unrecorded. The censuses of 1921, 1926 and 1931 did not make individual counts of the African population, probably under-estimated absentees, and under-counted in remote areas. The census of 1945 was better, but still not a true record of the African population. The censuses of 1921, 1931 and 1945 all recorded the numbers of Mozambique immigrants. Those conducted before 1945 may have substantially under-recorded the number of Africans and also the full extent of labour emigration out of Nyasaland.

Throughout the colonial period and up to the present, the rural population density of Nyasaland/Malawi has been among the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the population increased quite rapidly, doubling between 1901 and 1931, high infant mortality and deaths from tropical diseases restricted the natural increase to no more than 1 to 2 percent a year. The rest of the increase seems to have resulted from immigration from Mozambique. From 1931 to 1945, natural increase doubled, probably through improved medical services, and infant mortality gradually decreased. Although immigration continued throughout the colonial period, it was a less significant factor.

The 1921 census listed 108,204 &quot;Anguru&quot; (Lomwe-speaking immigrants from Mozambique). It is likely that a large number of those listed under other tribal names had crossed the border from Mozambique as well. It is also likely that the numbers of immigrants from tribal groups believed to belong to surrounding territories, mainly Mozambique and Northern Rhodesia, had doubled between 1921 and 1931. Most of this large migratory movement took place after 1926. The &quot;Anguru&quot; population further increased by more than 60 percent between 1931 and 1945. The 1966 census recorded 283,854 foreign-born Africans, of whom about 70 percent were born in Mozambique.

This inward immigration of families was somewhat balanced by outward labour emigration, mainly by men, to Southern Rhodesia and South Africa. The development of Nyasaland was likely adversely affected by the drain of workers to other countries. The Nyasaland government estimated that 58,000 adult males were working outside Nyasaland in 1935. The Southern Rhodesian census of 1931 alone recorded 54,000 male Nyasaland Africans there, so the former estimate was probably undercounting the total number of workers in other countries. In 1937, it was estimated that over 90,000 adult males were migrant workers: of these a quarter was thought not to have been in touch with their families for more than five years.

By 1945 almost 124,000 adult males and almost 9,500 adult females were known to be absent, excluding those who were not in touch with their families. The great bulk of migrant workers came from the rural Northern and Central regions: in 1937, out of 91,000 Africans recorded as absent, fewer than 11,000 were from districts in the south, where there were more jobs available. Labour migration continued up to and after independence. It was estimated that in 1963, some 170,000 men were absent and working abroad: 120,000 in Southern Rhodesia, 30,000 in South Africa, and 20,000 in Zambia.
==Administration==
===Central===
Throughout the period 1907 to 1953, Nyasaland was subject to direct superintendence and control by the Colonial Office and the United Kingdom parliament. Its administration was headed by a Governor, appointed by the British Government and responsible to the Colonial Office. As Nyasaland needed financial support through grants and loans, Governors also reported to HM Treasury on financial matters. From 1953 to the end of 1963, Nyasaland was part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which was not a fully independent state as it was constitutionally subordinate to the British government. Nyasaland remained a protectorate and its Governors retained responsibilities for local administration, labour and trade unions, African primary and secondary education, African agriculture and forestry, and internal policing.

The greater part of the Governors&#x27; former powers was transferred to the Federal government. This had sole responsibility for external affairs, defence, immigration, higher education, transport, posts and major aspects of economic policy, and the predominant role in health, industrial development and electricity. The Colonial Office retained ultimate power over African affairs and the African ownership of land. The Federation was formally dissolved on 31 December 1963; at the same time Nyasaland&#x27;s independence was fixed for 6 July 1964.

Most governors spent the bulk of their career in other territories but were assisted by heads of departments who spent their working life in Nyasaland. Some of these senior officials also sat on the two councils that advised governors. The Legislative Council was formed solely of officials in 1907 to advise governors on legislation; from 1909 a minority of nominated &quot;non-official&quot; members was added. Until 1961, the Governor had power to veto any ordinance passed by the Legislative Council. The Executive Council was a smaller body advising on policy. It was formed solely of officials until 1949, when two nominated white &quot;non-official&quot; members were added to eight officials.

The composition of the Legislative Council gradually became more representative. In 1930, its six &quot;non-official&quot; members were no longer nominated by the governor but were selected by as association representing white planters and businessmen. Until 1949, African interests were represented by one white missionary. That year the governor appointed three Africans and an Asian to join six white &quot;non-official&quot; and 10 official members.

From 1955, its six white &quot;non-official&quot; members were elected; five Africans (but no Asians) were nominated. Only in 1961 were all Legislative Council seats filled by election: the Malawi Congress Party won 22 of 28 seats. The party was also nominated to seven of the 10 Executive Council seats.

===Local===
The protectorate was divided into districts from 1892, with a Collector of Revenue (later called District Commissioner in charge of each. There were originally around a dozen districts, but the number had increased to some two dozen at independence. The 12 Collectors and 26 assistants in 1907 were responsible for collecting Hut tax and customs duties; they also had judicial responsibilities as magistrates, although few had any legal training. From 1920 the District Commissioners reported to three Provincial Commissioners for the Northern, Central and Southern provinces. They, in turn, reported to the Chief Secretary in Zomba. The numbers of District Commissioners and their assistants rose slowly to 51 in 1937 and about 120 in 1961.

In many parts of the protectorate, there were few strong chiefs. At first the British tried to evade the powers of existing chiefs who were powerful, minimising them in favour of direct rule by the Collectors. From 1912, Collectors were able to nominate principal headmen and village headmen as local intermediaries between the protectorate administration and local people, in an early form of Indirect rule. Each Collector could determine what powers to delegate to headmen in his district. Some appointed existing traditional chiefs as Principal headmen, who had significant authority locally.

Another version of indirect rule was instituted in 1933. The government authorized the chiefs and their councils as Native Authorities, but they had few real powers and little money to enforce them. The Native Authorities could set up Native Courts to decide cases under local customary law. But Sir Charles Golding, governor from 1924 to 1929, believed that the system of traditional chiefs was in decay and could not be relied on. Native Courts had no jurisdiction over European-owned estates. They were subject to the oversight of District Commissioners, and they were generally used by the colonial administration to enforce unpopular agricultural rules. They dealt with the vast bulk of civil disputes in the protectorate.

From 1902, the British established English law as the official legal code, and set up a High Court on the English model, with a Chief Justice and other judges. Appeals were heard by the East African Appeals Court in Zanzibar. Customary law was allowed (but not mandatory) in cases involving Africans, if native law or custom was not repugnant to English legal principles. Order was at first maintained by soldiers of the King&#x27;s African Rifles, some of whom were seconded to assist the District Commissioners, or by poorly trained police recruited by the District Commissioners. A better-trained central colonial police force was set up in 1922, but in 1945 it still had only 500 constables.

After the Second World War, the government increased expenditures on the police and expanded its forces into rural areas. A Police Training School was opened in 1952, police man-power increased to 750 by 1959, and new units were set up (the Special Branch and the Police Mobile Force for riot control). These changes proved insufficient when major disturbances took place in 1959, as support began to grow for independence. The government declared a state of emergency, and military forces were brought in from the Rhodesias and Tanganyika. Police manpower was rapidly expanded to about 3,000 through recruiting and training. After the Malawi Congress Party took power in 1962, it inherited a colonial police force of 3,000, including British senior officers.

==Land==
===Private===
European acquisition and ownership of large areas of land presented a major social and political problem for the protectorate, as Africans increasingly challenged this takeover of their land. Between 1892 and 1894, 3,705,255 acres (almost 1.5 million hectares, or 15% of the total land area of the protectorate) was alienated as European-owned estates through the colonial grant of Certificates of Claim. Of this, 2,702,379 acres (over 1 million hectares) in the north of the protectorate had been acquired by the British South Africa Company for its mineral potential; it was never turned into plantations. But much of the remaining land, some 867,000 acres (over 350,000 hectares) of estates, included a large proportion of the best arable lands in the Shire Highlands, which was the most densely populated part of the country and where Africans had relied on subsistence farming.

The first Commissioner of the Protectorate, Sir Harry Johnston, had hoped that the Shire Highlands would become an area for large-scale European settlement. He later considered it was too unhealthy. He acknowledged that it had a large African population who required sufficient land for their own use, although his successors did not share this view. Additional land alienations were much smaller. Around 250,000 acres of former Crown Lands were sold as freehold land or leased, and almost 400,000 acres more, originally in Certificates of Claim, were sold or leased in holdings whose average size was around 1,000 acres. Many of these were smaller farms operated by Europeans who came to Nyasaland after the First World War to grow tobacco.

As late as 1920, a Land Commission set up by the Nyasaland authorities proposed further land alienation, to promote the development of small to medium-size European plantations, from the 700,000 acres of Crown Land which it said were available after the present and future needs of the African people were met. This plan was rejected by the Colonial Office.

Much of the best land in the Shire Highlands was alienated to Europeans at the end of the 19th century. Of more than 860,000 acres (over 350,000 hectares) of estates in the Shire Highlands, only a quarter was poor-quality land. The other 660,000 acres were in areas of more fertile soils, which had a total area of some 1.3 million acres in the Shire Highlands. But two large belts one from Zomba town to Blantyre-Limbe, the second from Limbe to Thyolo town were almost entirely estates. In these two significant areas, Trust land for Africans was rare and consequently overcrowded.

In the early years of the protectorate, little of the land on estates was planted. Settlers wanted labour, and encouraged existing African residents to stay on the undeveloped land. According to L. White, by the 1880s large areas of the Shire Highlands may have become underpopulated through fighting or slave raiding. It was these almost empty and indefensible areas that Europeans claimed in the 1880s and 1890s. Few Africans were resident on estate lands at that time. After Europeans introduced the requirement for rent payments by tenant farmers, many Africans left the estates. Earlier African residents who had fled to more defensible areas usually avoided returning to settle on estates.

New workers (often the so-called &quot;Anguru&quot; migrants from Mozambique) were encouraged to move onto estates and grow their own crops, but were required to pay rent. In the early years, this was usually satisfied by two months&#x27; labour annually, under the system known as &quot;thangata.&quot; Later, many owners required a longer period of labour to pay the &quot;rent.&quot; In 1911 it was estimated that about 9% of the protectorate&#x27;s Africans lived on estates; in 1945, it was about 10%. These estates comprised 5% of the country by area, but about 15% of the total cultivable land. Estates appeared to have rather low populations relative to the quality of their land.

Three major estate companies retained landholdings in the Shire Highlands.
* The British Central Africa Company once owned 350,000 acres, but before 1928 it had sold or leased 50,000 acres. It retained two large blocks of land, each of around 100,000 acres, in the Shire Highlands. The rest of its properties were in or near to the Shire valley. From the late 1920s, it obtained cash rents from African tenants on crowded and unsupervised estates.
* A L Bruce Estates Ltd owned 160,000 acres, mostly in the single Magomero estate in Zomba, and Chiradzulu districts. Before the 1940s, it had sold little of its land and preferred to farm it directly; by 1948 the estate was largely let to tenants, who produced all its crops.
* Blantyre and East Africa Ltd had once owned 157,000 acres in Blantyre and Zomba districts, but sales to small planters reduced this to 91,500 acres by 1925. Until around 1930, it marketed its tenants&#x27; crops, but afterwards sought cash rents.

The 1920 Land Commission also considered the situation of Africans living on private estates, and proposed to give all tenants some security of tenure. Apart from the elderly and widows, all tenants would pay rents in cash by labour or by selling crops to the owner, but rent levels would be regulated. These proposals were enacted in 1928 after a 1926 census had shown that over 115,000 Africans (10% of the population) lived on estates.

Before 1928, the prevailing annual rent was 6 shillings. After 1928, maximum cash rents were fixed at £1 (20 shillings) for a plot of 8 acres, although some estates charged less. The &quot;equivalent&quot; rents in kind required delivering crops worth between 30 and 50 shillings instead of £1 cash, to discourage this option. Estate owners could expel up to 10% of their tenants every five years without showing any cause, and could expel male children of residents at age 16, and refuse to allow settlement to husbands of residents&#x27; daughters. The aim was to prevent overcrowding, but there was little land available to resettle those expelled. From 1943, evictions were resisted.

===Native Trust===
British legislation of 1902 treated all the land in Nyasaland not already granted as freehold as Crown Land, which could be alienated regardless of its residents&#x27; wishes. Only in 1904 did the Governor receive powers to reserve areas of Crown Land (called Native Trust Land) for the benefit of African communities, and it was not until 1936 that all conversion of Native Trust Land to freehold was prohibited by the 1936 Native Trust Lands Order. The aims of this legislation were to reassure the African people of their rights in land and to relieve them of fears of its alienation without their consent. Reassurance was needed, because in 1920 when Native Trust Land covered 6.6 million acres, a debate developed about the respective needs of European and African communities for land. The protectorate administration suggested that, although the African population might double in 30 years, it would still be possible to form new estates outside the Shire Highlands.

Throughout the whole protectorate, the vast majority of its people were rural rather than urban dwellers and over 90% of the rural African population lived on Crown Lands (including the reserves). Their access to land for farming was governed by customary law. This varied, but generally entitled a person granted or inheriting the use of land (not its ownership) the exclusive right to farm it for an indefinite period, with the right to pass it to their successors, unless it was forfeited for a crime, neglect or abandonment. There was an expectation that community leaders would allocate communal land to the community members, but limit its allocation to outsiders. Customary law had little legal status in the early colonial period and little recognition or protection was given to customary land or the communities that used it then.

It has been claimed that throughout the colonial period and up to 1982 Malawi had sufficient arable land to meet the basic food needs of its population, if the arable land were distributed equally and used to produce food. As early as 1920, while the Land Commission did not consider that the country was inherently overcrowded, it noted that, in congested districts where a large proportion of the working population was employed, particularly on tea estates or near towns, families had only 1 to 2 acres to farm. By 1946, the congested districts were even more crowded.

===Reform===
From 1938, the protectorate administration began to purchase small amounts of under-used estate land for resettlement of those evicted. These purchases were insufficient and, in 1942, hundreds of Africans in the Blantyre District who had been served with notices to quit refused to leave since there was no other land for them. Two years later the same difficulty arose in the densely populated Cholo District, two-thirds of whose land constituted private estates.

In 1946 the Nyasaland government appointed a commission, the Abrahams Commission (also known the Land Commission) to inquire into land issues following the riots and disturbances by tenants on European-owned estates in 1943 and 1945. It had only one member, Sir Sidney Abrahams, who proposed that the Nyasaland government should purchase all unused or under-used freehold land on European-owned estates which would become Crown land, available to African farmers. The Africans on estates were to be offered the choice of remaining on the estate as workers or tenants or of moving to Crown land. These proposals were not implemented in full until 1952.

The report of the Abrahams Commission divided opinion. Africans were generally in favour of its proposals, as was the governor from 1942 to 1947, Edmund Richards (who had proposed the establishment of a Land Commission) and the incoming governor, Geoffrey Colby. Estate owners and managers were strongly against it, and many European settlers bitterly attacked it.

As a result of the Abrahams report, in 1947 the Nyasaland government set up a Land Planning Committee of civil servants to advise on implementing its proposals and deal with the acquisition of land for resettlement. It recommended the re-acquisition only of land which was either undeveloped or occupied by large numbers of African residents or tenants. Land capable of future development as estates was to be protected against unorganised cultivation. From 1948, the programme of land acquisition intensified, assisted by an increased willingness of estate owners who saw no future in merely leasing land and marketing their tenants&#x27; crops. In 1948, it was estimated that 1.2 million acres (or 487,000 hectares) of freehold estates remained, with an African population of 200,000. At independence in 1964, only some 422,000 acres (171,000 hectares) of European-owned estates remained, mainly as tea estates or small estates farmed directly by their owners.

==Agricultural economy==
Although Nyasaland has some mineral resources, particularly coal, these were not exploited in colonial times. Without economic mineral resources, the protectorate&#x27;s economy had to be based on agriculture, but in 1907 most of its people were subsistence farmers. In the mid-to-late 19th century, cassava, rice, beans and millet were grown in the Shire Valley, maize, cassava, sweet potatoes and sorghum in the Shire Highlands, and cassava, millet and groundnuts along the shores of Lake Nyasa (now Lake Malawi). These crops continued to be staple foods throughout the colonial period, although with less millet and more maize. Tobacco and a local variety of cotton were grown widely.

Throughout the protectorate, the colonial Department of Agriculture favoured European planter interests. Its negative opinion of African agriculture, which it failed to promote, helped to prevent the creation of a properly functioning peasant economy. It criticised the practice of shifting cultivation in which trees on the land to be cultivated were cut down and burnt and their ashes dug into the soil to fertilise it. The land was used for a few years after another section of land was cleared.

Compared with European, North American and Asian soils many sub-Saharan African soils are low in natural fertility, being poor in nutrients, low in organic matter and liable to erosion. The best cultivation technique for such soils involves 10 to 15 years of fallow between 2 or 3 years of cultivation, the system of shifting cultivation and fallowing that was common in Nyasaland as long as there was sufficient land to practice it. As more intensive agricultural use began in the 1930s, the amounts and duration of fallow were progressively reduced in more populous areas, which placed soil fertility under gradually increasing pressure. The Department of Agriculture&#x27;s prediction that soil fertility would decline at a rapid rate is contradicted by recent research. This showed that the majority of soils in Malawi were adequate for smallholders to produce maize. Most have sufficient (if barely so) organic material and nutrients, although their low nitrogen and phosphorus favours the use of chemical fertilisers and manure.

Although in the early years of the 20th century European estates produced the bulk of exportable cash crops directly, by the 1930s, a large proportion of many of these crops (particularly tobacco) was produced by Africans, either as smallholders on Crown land or as tenants on the estates. The first estate crop was coffee, grown commercially in quantity from around 1895, but competition from Brazil which flooded the world markets by 1905 and droughts led to its decline in favour of tobacco and cotton. Both these crops had previously been grown in small quantities, but the decline of coffee prompted planters to turn to tobacco in the Shire Highlands and cotton in the Shire Valley.

Tea was also first planted commercially in 1905 in the Shire Highlands, with significant development of tobacco and tea growing taking place after the opening of the Shire Highlands Railway in 1908. During the 56 years that the protectorate existed, tobacco, tea and cotton were the main export crops, and tea was the only one that remained an estate crop throughout. The main barriers to increasing exports were the high costs of transport from Nyasaland to the coast, the poor quality of much of the produce and, for African farmers, the planters&#x27; opposition to them growing cotton or tobacco in competition with the estates.

===Crops===
The areas of flue-cured brightleaf or Virginia tobacco farmed by European planters in the Shire Highlands rose from 4,500 acres in 1911 to 14,200 acres in 1920, yielding 2,500 ton of tobacco. Before 1920, about 5% of the crop sold was dark-fired tobacco produced by African farmers, and this rose to 14% by 1924. The First World War boosted the production of tobacco, but post-war competition from United States Virginia required a rebate of import duty under Imperial Preference to assist Nyasaland growers.

Much of the tobacco produced by the European estates was of low-grade. In 1921, 1,500 tons of a 3,500-ton crop was saleable and many smaller European growers went out of business. Between 1919 and 1935 their numbers fell from 229 to 82. The decline in flue-cured tobacco intensified throughout the 1920s. Europeans produced 86% of Malawi&#x27;s tobacco in 1924, 57% in 1927, 28% in 1933, and 16% in 1936. Despite this decline, tobacco accounted for 65–80% of exports from 1921 to 1932.

Formation of a Native Tobacco Board in 1926 stimulated the production of fire-cured tobacco. By 1935, 70% of the national tobacco crop was grown in the Central Province where the Board had around 30,000 registered growers. At first, these farmed Crown land, but later estates contracted sharecropping &quot;Visiting Tenants&quot;. The number of growers fluctuated until the Second World War then expanded, so by 1950 there were over 104,500 growers planting 132,000 acres and growing 10,000 tons of tobacco. 15,000 were growers in the Southern Province. About three-quarters were smallholders on Native Trust Land, the rest estate tenants. Numbers declined later, but there were still 70,000 in 1965, producing 12,000 tons. Although the value of tobacco exports continued to rise, they decreased as a proportion of the total after 1935 because of the increased importance of tea.

Egyptian cotton was first grown commercially by African smallholders in the upper Shire valley in 1903 and spread to the lower Shire valley and the shores of Lake Nyasa. By 1905 American Upland cotton was grown on estates in the Shire Highlands. African-grown cotton was bought by British Central Africa Company and the African Lakes Corporation until 1912 when government cotton markets were established where a fairer price for cotton was given.

Reckless opening-up of unsuitable land by inexperienced planters had led to 22,000 acres of cotton in 1905, but 140 tons were exported. Halving of the area to 10,000 acres and improving quality made cotton more important, to a peak of 44% of export value in 1917 when the First World War stimulated demand to 1,750 tons. A shortage of manpower and disastrous floods in the lower Shire valley caused a drop in production to 365 tons in 1918. It was not until 1924 that the industry recovered, reaching 2,700 tons in 1932 and a record of 4,000 tons exported in 1935. This was mainly African production in the lower Shire valley, as output from European estates became insignificant. The relative importance of cotton exports dropped from 16% of the total in 1922 to 5% in 1932, then rallied to 10% in 1941, falling to 7% in 1951. The quality of cotton produced improved from the 1950s with stricter controls on pests and, although 80% of the crop continued to be grown in the lower Shire valley, it also began to be grown in the northern shore of Lake Malawi. Production varied widely, and increasing amounts were used domestically, but at independence cotton was only the fourth most valuable export crop.

Tea was first exported from Nyasaland in 1904 after tea plantations were established in the high rainfall areas of Mlanje District, later extended into Cholo District. Exports steadily increased from 375 tons in 1922 to 1,250 tons in 1932, from 12,600 acres planted. The importance of tea increased dramatically after 1934, from only 6% of total exports in 1932 to over 20% in 1935. It never fell below that level, rising to over 40% from 1938 to 1942, and in the three years 1955, 1957 and 1960 the value of tea exports exceeded that of tobacco and until the mid-1960s, Nyasaland had the most extensive area of tea cultivation in Africa. Despite its value to the protectorate&#x27;s economy, the main problem with its tea on the international market was its low quality.

Groundnut exports were insignificant before 1951 when they amounted to 316 tons, but a government scheme to promote their cultivation and better prices led to a rapid increase in the mid-to-late 1950s. At independence, the annual exports totalled 25,000 tons and groundnuts became Nyasaland&#x27;s third most valuable export. They are also widely grown for food. In the 1930s and 1940s, Nyasaland became a major producer of tung oil and over 20,000 acres on estates in the Shire Highlands were planted with tung trees. After 1953, world prices declined and production dropped as tung oil was replaced by cheaper petrochemical substitutes. Until the 1949 famine, maize was not exported but a government scheme then promoted it as a cash crop, and 38,500 tons were exported in 1955. By independence, local demand had reduced exports to virtually nil.

===Hunger and famine===
Seasonal hunger was common in pre-colonial and early colonial times, as peasant farmers grew food for their families&#x27; needs, with only small surpluses to store, barter for livestock or pass to dependents. Famines were often associated with warfare, as in a major famine in the south of the country in 1863. One theory of colonial-era African famines is that colonialism led to poverty by expropriating land for cash crops or forcing farmers to grow them (reducing their ability to produce food), underpaying for their crops, charging rents for expropriated lands and taxing them arbitrarily (reducing their ability to buy food). The introduction of a market economy eroded several pre-colonial survival strategies such as growing secondary crops in case the main one failed, gathering wild food or seeking support from family or friends and eventually created an underclass of the chronically malnourished poor.

Nyasaland suffered local famines in 1918 and at various times between 1920 and 1924, and significant food shortages in other years. The government took little action until the situation was critical when relief supplies were expensive and their distribution delayed and was also reluctant to issue free relief to the able-bodied. It imported around 2,000 tons of maize for famine relief in 1922 and 1923 and buy grain in less-affected areas. Although these events were on a smaller scale than in 1949, the authorities did not react by making adequate preparations to counteract later famines.

In November and December 1949, the rains stopped several months early and food shortages rapidly developed in the Shire Highlands. Government and mission employees, many urban workers and some estate tenants received free or subsidised food or food on credit. Those less able to cope, such as widows or deserted wives, the old, the very young and those already in poverty suffered most, and families did not help remoter relatives. In 1949 and 1950, 25,000 tons of food were imported, although initial deliveries were delayed. The official mortality figure was 100 to 200 deaths, but the true number may have been higher, and there were severe food shortages and hunger in 1949 and 1950.

==Transport==

From the time of Livingstone&#x27;s expedition in 1859, the Zambesi, Shire River, and Lake Nyasa waterways were seen as the most convenient method of transport for Nyasaland. The Zambesi-Lower Shire and Upper Shire-Lake Nyasa systems were separated by of impassable falls and rapids in the Middle Shire which prevented continuous navigation. The main economic centres of the protectorate at Blantyre and in the Shire Highlands were from the Shire, and transport of goods from that river was by inefficient and costly head porterage or ox-cart. Until 1914, small river steamers carrying 100 tons or less operated between the British concession of Chinde at the mouth of the Zambezi and the Lower Shire, about . The British government had obtained a 99-year lease of a site for an ocean port at Chinde at which passengers transferred to river steamers from Union-Castle Line and German East Africa Line ships up to 1914, when the service was suspended. The Union-Castle service was resumed between 1918 and 1922 when the port at Chinde was damaged by a cyclone.

Until the opening of the railway in 1907, passengers and goods were transferred to smaller boats at Chiromo to go a further upstream to Chikwawa, where porters carried goods up the escarpment and passengers continued on foot. Low water levels in Lake Nyasa reduced the Shire River&#x27;s flow from 1896 to 1934; this and the changing sandbanks made navigation difficult in the dry season. The main port moved downriver from Chiromo to Port Herald in 1908, but by 1912 it was difficult and often impossible to use Port Herald, so a Zambezi port was needed. The extension of the railway to the Zambezi in 1914 effectively ended significant water transport on the Lower Shire, and low water levels ended it on the Upper Shire, but it has continued on Lake Nyasa up to the present.

A number of lake steamers, at first based at Fort Johnston, served lakeside communities which had poor road connections. Their value was increased in 1935 when a northern extension of the railway from Blantyre reached Lake Nyasa, and a terminal for Lake Services was developed at Salima. Harbour facilities at several lake ports were inadequate and there were few good roads to most ports: some in the north had no road connection.

Railways could supplement water transport and, as Nyasaland was nowhere closer than to a suitable Indian Ocean port, a short rail link to river ports that eliminated porterage was initially more practical than a line direct to the coast passing through low-population areas. The Shire Highlands Railway opened a line from Blantyre to Chiromo in 1907 and extended it to Port Herald, from Blantyre in 1908. After Port Herald became unsatisfactory, the British South Africa Company built the Central African Railway, mainly in Mozambique, of from Port Herald to Chindio on the north bank of the Zambezi in 1914. From here, goods went by river steamers to Chinde then by sea to Beira, involving three transhipments and delays. The Central African Railway was poorly built and soon needed extensive repairs.

Chinde was severely damaged by a cyclone in 1922 and was unsuitable for larger ships. The alternative ports were Beira, which had developed as a major port in the early 20th century, and the small port of Quelimane. Beira was congested, but significant improvements were made to it in the 1920s: the route to Quelimane was shorter, but the port was underdeveloped. The Trans-Zambezia Railway, constructed between 1919 and 1922, ran from the south bank of the Zambezi to join the main line from Beira to Rhodesia. Its promoters had interests in Beira port, and they ignored its high cost and limited benefit to Nyasaland of a shorter alternative route.

The Zambezi crossing ferry, using steamers to tow barges, had limited capacity and was a weak point in the link to Beira. For part of the year the river was too shallow and at other times it flooded. In 1935, the ferry was replaced by construction of the Zambezi Bridge, over long, creating an uninterrupted rail link to the sea. In the same year, a northern extension from Blantyre to Lake Nyasa was completed.

The Zambezi Bridge and northern extension generated less traffic than anticipated, and it was only in 1946 that traffic volumes predicted in 1937 were reached. The rail link was inadequate for heavy loads, being a single narrow-gauge track with sharp curves and steep gradients. Maintenance costs were high and freight volumes were low, so transport rates were up to three times Rhodesian and East African levels. Although costly and inefficient, the rail link to Beira remained Nyasaland&#x27;s main transport link up to and beyond independence. A second rail link to the Mozambique port of Nacala was first proposed in 1964 and is the principal route for imports and exports today.

Roads in the early protectorate were little more than trails, barely passable in the wet season. Roads suitable for motor vehicles were developed in the southern half of the protectorate in the 1920s and replaced head porterage, but few all-weather roads existed in the northern half until quite late in the 1930s, so motor transport was concentrated in the south. Road travel was becoming an alternative to rail, but government regulations designed to promote railway use hindered this development. When the northern railway extension was completed, proposals failed to be carried out to build a road traffic interchange at Salima and improve roads in the Central Province to help develop Central Nyasaland and Eastern Zambia. Road transport remained underdeveloped and, at independence, there were few tarmac roads.

Air transport began modestly in 1934 with weekly Rhodesian and Nyasaland Airways service from an airstrip at Chileka to Salisbury, increased to twice weekly in 1937. Blantyre (Chileka) was also linked to Beira from 1935. All flights were discontinued in 1940 but in 1946 Central African Airways Corporation, backed by the governments of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland resumed services. Its Salisbury to Blantyre service was extended to Nairobi, a Blantyre-Lilongwe-Lusaka service was added and internal services ran to Salima and Karonga. The former Nyasaland arm of the corporation became Air Malawi in 1964.

==Nationalism==

The first protests against colonial rule came from two sources. Firstly, independent African churches rejected European missionary control and, through Watch Tower and other groups, promoted Millennialism doctrines that the authorities considered seditious. Secondly, Africans educated by missions or abroad sought social, economic and political advancement through voluntary &quot;Native Associations&quot;. Both movements were generally peaceful, but a violent uprising in 1915 by John Chilembwe expressed both religious radicalism and the frustration of educated Africans denied an effective voice, as well as anger over African casualties in the First World War.

After Chilembwe&#x27;s uprising, protests were muted until the early 1930s and concentrated on improving African education and agriculture. Political representation was a distant aspiration. A 1930 declaration by the British government that white settlers north of the Zambezi could not form minority governments dominating Africans stimulated the political awareness.

Agitation by the government of Southern Rhodesia led to a Royal Commission on future association between Northern and Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, or all three territories. Despite almost unanimous African opposition to amalgamation with Southern Rhodesia, the Bledisloe Commission report of 1939 did not entirely rule out some form of association in the future, provided Southern Rhodesian forms of racial discrimination were not applied north of the Zambezi.

The danger of Southern Rhodesian rule made African demands for political rights more urgent, and in 1944 various local Voluntary Associations united as the Nyasaland African Congress (NAC). One of its first demands was to have African representation on the Legislative Council, which was conceded in 1949. From 1946, the NAC received financial and political support from Hastings Banda, then living in Britain. Despite this support, Congress lost momentum until the revival of amalgamation proposals in 1948 gave it new life.

Post-war British governments were persuaded that closer association in Central Africa would cut costs, and they agreed to a federal solution, not the full amalgamation that the Southern Rhodesian government preferred. The main African objections to the Federation were summed up in a joint memorandum prepared by Hastings Banda for Nyasaland and Harry Nkumbula for Northern Rhodesia in 1951. These were that political domination by the white minority of Southern Rhodesia would prevent greater African political participation and that control by Southern Rhodesian politicians would lead to an extension of racial discrimination and segregation.

The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was pushed through in 1953 against very strong African opposition including riots and deaths in Cholo District although there were also local land issues. In 1953, the NAC opposed federation and demanded independence. Its supporters demonstrated against taxes and pass laws. In early 1954, Congress abandoned its campaign and lost much of its support. Shortly after its formation, the Federal government attempted to take control of African affairs from the British Colonial Office. It also scaled-back the fairly modest British post-war development proposals.

In 1955, the Colonial Office agreed to the suggestion of the governor of Nyasaland that African representation on the Legislative Council should be increased from three to five members, and that the African members should no longer be appointed by the governor, but nominated by Provincial Councils. As these Provincial Councils were receptive to popular wishes, this allowed these Councils to nominate Congress members to the Legislative Council. This occurred in 1956 when Henry Chipembere and Kanyama Chiume, two young radical members of Congress, were nominated together with three moderates, including two Congress supporters. This success led to a rapid growth in Congress membership in 1956 and 1957.

Several of the younger members of the Nyasaland African Congress had little faith in the ability of its leader, T D T Banda, who they also accused of dishonesty, and wished to replace him with Dr Hastings Banda, then living in the Gold Coast. Dr Banda announced he would only return if given the presidency of Congress. After this was agreed he returned to Nyasaland in July 1958 and T D T Banda was ousted.

==Independence==
Banda and Congress Party leaders started a campaign of direct action against federation, for immediate constitutional change and eventual independence. As this included resistance to Federal directives on farming practices, protests were widespread and sometimes violent. In January 1958, Banda presented Congress proposals for constitutional reform to the governor, Sir Robert Armitage. These were for an African majority in the Legislative Council and at least parity with non-Africans in the Executive Council.

The governor rejected the proposals, and this breakdown in constitutional talks led to demands within Congress for an escalation of anti-government protests and more violent action. As Congress supporters became more violent and Congress leaders made increasingly inflammatory statements, Armitage decided against offering concessions but prepared for mass arrests. On 21 February, European troops of the Rhodesia Regiment were flown into Nyasaland and, in the days immediately following, police or troops opened fire on rioters in several places, leading to four deaths.

In deciding to make widespread arrests covering almost the whole Congress organisation, Armitage was influenced by a report received by the police from an informer of a meeting of Congress leaders at which, it was claimed by the Head of Special Branch that the indiscriminate killing of Europeans and Asians, and of those Africans opposed to Congress was planned, the so-called &quot;murder plot&quot;. There is no evidence that any formal plan existed, and the Nyasaland government took no immediate action against Banda or other Congress leaders but continued to negotiate with them until late February.

In the debate in the House of Commons on 3 March 1959, the day that the State of Emergency was declared, Alan Lennox-Boyd, the Colonial Secretary, stated that it was clear from information received that Congress had planned the widespread murder of Europeans, Asians and moderate Africans, &quot;... in fact, a massacre was being planned&quot;. This was the first public mention of a murder plot and, later in the same debate, the Minister of State at the Colonial Office, Julian Amery, reinforced what Lennox-Boyd had said with talk of a &quot;... conspiracy of murder&quot; and &quot;a massacre ... on a Kenyan scale&quot;.

The strongest criticism later made by the Devlin Commission was over the &quot;murder plot&quot;, whose existence it doubted, and it condemned the use made of it by both the Nyasaland and British governments in trying to justify the Emergency, while at the same time conceding that the declaration of a State of Emergency was &quot;justified in any event&quot;. The commission also declared that Banda had no knowledge of the inflammatory talk of some Congress activists about attacking Europeans.

On 3 March 1959 Sir Robert Armitage, as governor of Nyasaland, declared a State of Emergency over the whole of the protectorate and, in a police and military undertaking which it called Operation Sunrise arrested Dr. Hastings Banda its president and other members of its executive committee, as well as over a hundred local party officials. The Nyasaland African Congress was banned the next day. Those arrested were detained without trial, and the total number detained finally rose to over 1,300. Over 2,000 more were imprisoned for offences related to the emergency, including rioting and criminal damage. The stated aim of these measures was to allow the Nyasaland government to restore law and order after the increasing lawlessness following Dr Banda&#x27;s return. Rather than calming the situation immediately, in the emergency that followed fifty-one Africans were killed and many more were wounded.

Of these, 20 were killed at Nkhata Bay where those detained in the Northern Region were being held prior to being transferred south. A local Congress leader encouraged a large crowd to gather, apparently to secure the release of the detainees. Troops who should have arrived in the town early on 3 March were delayed and, when they arrived, the District Commissioner, who felt the situation was out of control ordered them to open fire. Twelve more deaths occurred up to 19 March, mostly when soldiers of the Royal Rhodesia Regiment or Kings African Rifles opened fire on rioters. The remainder of the 51 officially recorded deaths were in military operations in the Northern Region. The NAC, which was banned in 1958 was re-formed as the Malawi Congress Party in 1959.

After the emergency, a commission headed by Lord Devlin exposed the failings of the Nyasaland administration. The Commission found that the declaration of a State of Emergency was necessary to restore order and prevent a descent into anarchy, but it criticised instances of the illegal use of force by the police and troops, including burning houses, destroying property and beatings. It rejected the existence of any &quot;murder plot&quot;, but noted:

The report concluded that the Nyasaland administration had lost the support of Nyasaland&#x27;s African people, noting their almost universal rejection of Federation. Finally, it suggested that the British government should negotiate with African leaders on the country&#x27;s constitutional future. The Devlin Commission&#x27;s report is the only example of a British judge examining whether the actions of a colonial administration in suppressing dissent were appropriate. Devlin&#x27;s conclusions that excessive force was used and that Nyasaland was a &quot;police state&quot; caused political uproar. His report was largely rejected and the state of emergency lasted until June 1960.

At first, the British government tried to calm the situation by nominating additional African members (who were not Malawi Congress Party supporters) to the Legislative Council. It soon decided that the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland could not be maintained. It was formally dissolved on 31 December 1963 but had ceased to be relevant to Nyasaland sometime before this. It also decided that Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia should be given responsible government under majority rule. Banda was released in April 1960 and invited to London to discuss proposals for responsible government.

Following the Malawi Congress Party&#x27;s overwhelming victory in August 1961 elections, Banda and four other Malawi Congress Party members or supporters joined the Executive Council as elected ministers alongside five officials. After a constitutional conference in London in 1962, Nyasaland achieved internal self-government with Banda as Prime Minister in February 1963. Full independence was achieved on 6 July 1964 with Banda as Prime Minister, and the country became the Republic of Malawi, a republic within the Commonwealth, on 6 July 1966, with Banda as president.

<text>Dayan Khan (; ), born Batumöngke ( , ; &quot;Bātúméngkè&quot;; 1472–1517) was a khagan of the Northern Yuan dynasty, reigning from 1480 to 1517. During his rule, he reunited the Mongols under Chinggisid supremacy. His reigning title, &quot;Dayan&quot;, means &quot;the whole&quot; or &quot;long lasting&quot; in Mongolian language as he was the longest reigning khagan of the unified Mongols.

Dayan Khan eliminated Oirat power and abolished the taishi system used by both local and foreign warlords. Dayan Khan&#x27;s victory at Dalan Tergin reunified the Mongols and solidified their identity as Chinggisid people. His decision to divide the six tumens of Eastern Mongolia as fiefs for his sons created decentralized but stable Borjigin rule over the Mongolian Plateau for a century.

==Childhood==
Batumongke was the son of Bayanmongke (Bayanmunh) (fl. 1470–1480) the Bolkhu jinong (or crown prince/viceroy) of the Borjigin clan and Shiker Taiko (Shihir Taihu) of the Uriyangkhai in Mongolia. His paternal grandmother, Sechen, was a daughter of Esen Tayshi of the Oirats. Although Bolkhu and his family suffered through life&#x27;s darkest hours during the reign of Esen and the internal conflict of the Northern Yuan dynasty, they were welcomed by his uncle (brother) Manduul Khan (r. 1465–1467) soon after his coronation.

Batumongke&#x27;s father and his uncle Manduul had come to blows due to warlords&#x27; convictions, and Bayanmongke had fled and been murdered. Manduul&#x27;s taishi Ismayil (also known as Isama) then took his wife Shikher and properties. In order to save Batumongke&#x27;s life Shiker gave her child to the Bakhay family to nurse him. However, Temur-Qadag of the Tangud (already Mongolicized) took the child from Bakhay. Because of his Borjigin blood, Batumongke was well taken care of by the Mongol commoners and minor nobles.

At the sudden death of Manduul Khan in 1467, Batumongke was five years old. Later he was adopted by Mandukhai Khatun, the widow of Manduul Khan. When Mandukhai&#x27;s loyalists brought back Batumongke, he was suffering echinococcosis. Mandukhai had him treated and the boy recovered soon.

==Reign==
As a direct descendant of Kublai Khan (r. 1260–1294), Mandukhai had him ascend to the throne at the age of eight at the Royal shrine kept by the Chakhar and he became known by the title &quot;Dayan Khan&quot;. When he was aged nineteen, she married him, and retained great influence over court and military. They reunified the Mongol retainers of the former eastern region of the Mongol Empire. The Oirats were defeated by the military skill of Mandukhai and control was reclaimed over the Eastern Mongols. Batumongke and his queen Mandukhai led Mongol armies in 1483 against Ismayil Taishi who after the imperial victory over him fled to Hami where he was killed by other Muslims and Turco-Mongols. Dayan Khan&#x27;s mother Shiker was brought back and given the title taikhu (empress dowager). However, she did not live long enough after that. The imperial power was supported by Unubold (Naybolad), the descendant of Hasar who was the brother of Genghis Khan, and the tribes ruled by descendants of Genghis Khan&#x27;s brothers were allied. Most of the Four Oirats remaining in Mongolia surrendered and provided troops. Only Khoosai of the Tumed rejected Dayan Khan&#x27;s supremacy but was defeated in turn.

The most important achievement of the couple was their defeat of the war-like Oirats who had previously revolted against the rule of the Borjigin Emperors since the 14th century. By 1495, Batumongke won the Three Guards (Doyin Uriankhai, Ujiyed and Fuyu guard), tributaries of the Ming dynasty, and had them incorporated into his Six tumens.

===Early conflicts with Ming dynasty===
While the Golden Horde lost its power in 1480, Mongol raids on Ming borderlands became virtually constant. Under Dayan Khan they reached a new level of organization. Dayan Khan intended to maintain good relations with Ming dynasty at first. His envoys were sent to sign open-trade contract with gifts, but one of them was killed by the Ming court, so he launched military expeditions into the Ming China. Dayan Khan as a mature ruler had no interest in joining the Ming&#x27;s tribute system.

Dayan Khan allied with the Monggoljins under Toloogen and Khooshai of Ordos. With Dayan Khan and Mandukhai&#x27;s movement to the Eight white yurts in Ordos in 1500, they launched a massive attack on Ningxia and conquered some lands. At first their invasion caused trouble to the Ming Chinese but Yu, the officer of the Ming Dynasty, and his commander Wang ambushed the Mongols and organized an unexpectedly vigorous counter attack in an attempt to capture Dayan Khan the next year. Barely escaping the Ming attack, Dayan Khan relocated to the Kherlen River, yet large-scale raids all along the frontier continued through 1507.

=== The unrest of the Right Wing ===
A delegation from the Three Right Wing Tumens (Ordos, Tümed and Yöngshiyebü) invited Dayan Khan to rule them. Because Iburai Taishi (also known as Ibrahim), an Uighur adventurer or an Oirat/Kharchin warlord and Mandulai dominated the area, the three Tumens were seeking a more agreeable arrangement. In a skirmish raid on one of the rebel groups, the imperial army killed Ibrahim’s younger brother. Dayan Khan dispatched to the Tumens his sons Ulusbaikh (Ulusbold) and Barsubolad Sainalag. As Ulusbold was being enthroned as jinong, he was killed in a riot and Barsubolad escaped. In revenge, Dayan Khan attacked the Three Right Wing Tumens with his three Left Wing Tumens (Chakhar, Khalkha and Uriankhai), the Khorchin and the Abagha. Because a large group of the Uriankhai Tumen defected to Iburai, Dayan Khan was first defeated at Turgen Stream at present-day Tumed territory.

In 1510, he crushed the Three Right Wing Tumens and killed Mandulai, the Ordos elder. Iburai fled to Kokenuur (Qinghai) where he remained active to 1533. Dayan Khan dispersed the rebel Uriankhais among other 5 tumens. Instead of enslaving the Right Wing Tumens, Dayan Khan had Barsubolad enthroned as jinong (晉王) in 1513, abolishing old titles like taishi (太師) and chingsang (丞相) of the Yuan dynasty. He exempted his soldiers from imposts and made them Darqan. According to an ancient Mongolian source, the Mongols were again peaceful thereafter thanks to the policy of Dayan Khan and his khatun Maudukhai.

With defeats of Iburai and Ismayil, Dayan and Mandukhai could remove the power of descendants of the Alans, the Kypchaks and the Hami Muslim warlords from the Northern Yuan court in the Mongolian Plateau.

===Later conflicts with the Ming dynasty===
From 1513, Mongol invasions of the Ming Empire recommenced. Dayan Khan built forts in Xuanhua and Datong. He also stationed 30,000 cavalry on Ming territory. His Mongols numbering up to 175,000 invaded the Ming Empire in 1514 and 1517. His sons established a series of permanent bases along the Ming border where the Mongols could keep watch on the Ming troops. Batumongke Dayan Khan repeatedly sought trade relation with the Ming, but rejection turned him more and more to outright warfare.

The high point of Mongol power came in 1517, when Dayan Khan moved on Beijing itself. Although the Ming dynasty held the Mongols off in a major battle, Dayan Khan and his successors continued to threaten China until 1526. The Mongol armies raided the Ming dynasty not only in the north, but also in the hitherto quiet west. The Zhengde Emperor of the Ming dynasty lost his protectorate Hami to the Turpans at the same time. In 1542, Dayan Khan defeated Ming troops just before his death.

Dayan Khan and Mandukhai&#x27;s nation now stretched from the Siberian tundra and Lake Baikal in the north, across the Gobi, to the edge of the Yellow River and south of it into the Ordos. The lands extended from the forests of Manchuria in the East past the Altai Mountains and out onto the steppes of Central Asia.

===Reform===
He reorganized the Eastern Mongols into 6 tumens (literally &quot;ten thousand&quot;) as follows:

*Left Wing: Khalkha, Chahar and Uriankhai
*Right Wing: Ordos, Tümed and Yöngshiyebü (including Asud and Kharchin)

They functioned both as military units and as tribal administrative bodies. Northern Khalkha people and Uriyankhan were attached to the South Khalkha of eastern Inner Mongolia and Doyin Uriyangkhan of the Three Guards, respectively. After the failed rebellion of the northern Uriankhai people, they were divided in 1538 and mostly annexed by the northern Khalkha. Under Dayan Khan or his successors, the Eastern Mongols compelled the Barga to surrender. However, his decision to divide the Six tumens to his sons, or taijis, and local tabunangs, sons-in-law of the taijis, created a decentralized system of Borjigin rule that secured domestic peace and outward expansion for a century. Despite this decentralization there was a remarkable concord within the Dayan Khanid aristocracy and intra-Chinggisid civil war remained unknown until the reign of Ligden Khan (1604–34).

==In fiction==
Dayan&#x27;s early life is also fictionalized in books three and four of the historical fiction &quot;Fractured Empire Saga&quot;, by Starr Z. Davies, published 2021-2022, a four-book series: &quot;Daughter of the Yellow Dragon&quot;, &quot;Lords of the Black Banner&quot;, &quot;Mother of the Blue Wolf&quot;, &quot;Empress of the Jade Realm&quot;.

Dayan Khan is an important background character in the historical novel &quot;Manduchai&quot;, written by German Author Tanja Kinkel in 2014.

Dayan Khan appeared as a background character in the historical drama &quot;Marco Polo&quot; on Season 2 Episode 11, written John Fusco and Lorenzo Richelmy in 2016.

==Family==
Dayan Khan married Mandukhai the Wise, Guushi and Jimsgene.

* Parents:
** Bayanmunh
** Shihir Taihu
*Wives and children:
# Mandukhai
##Turbolad
##Ulusbold
##Arsubolad
##Barsubolad
##Töröltu 
##Ochirbolad
##Alchubolad
##Albolad
# Jimsgene
##Gersenji
##Gerbolad
#Guushi 
##Gert
##Chintaiji

His sons were made tribal chiefs. Many princes in the Mongolian Plateau were his descendants such as Altan Khan and Ligden Khan. Dayan Khan and his successor Khagans led the Chahar tumen directly. The Chinese chroniclers of the Ming dynasty considered him a Holy Emperor who restored former glory of the Mongol Empire. There is much that is uncertain about Dayan Khan&#x27;s life after the death of Mandukhai. The dates of death range from 1517 until 1543.

<text>Stoke City Football Club is a professional association football club based in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England. The team competes in the , the second level of the English football league system.

Founded as Stoke Ramblers in 1863, the club changed its name to Stoke in 1878 and then to Stoke City in 1925 after Stoke-on-Trent was granted city status. Stoke&#x27;s home ground is the 30,089 capacity bet365 Stadium. Before it was opened in 1997, the club was based at the Victoria Ground, which was their home ground since 1878. The club&#x27;s nickname is The Potters, after the pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent, and their traditional home kit is a red-and-white vertically striped shirt, white shorts and stockings. Their traditional rivals are Midlands clubs West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers, whilst their local rivals are Port Vale with whom they contest the Potteries derby.

Stoke were one of the twelve founding members of the Football League in 1888. They failed re-election in 1890, but were re-admitted after winning the 1890–91 Football Alliance title. The club were relegated from the First Division in 1907 and entered liquidation the following year. Though the club was saved, they were not re-elected until 1915, and instead spent the intervening years in the Birmingham &amp; District League and Southern League. Promoted from the Second Division in 1921–22, the club were relegated twice in four years by 1926. Stoke won the Third Division North in 1926–27 and then the Second Division title in 1932–33. They remained in the top-flight for twenty years and then spent a decade in the Second Division, before winning promotion as champions in 1962–63.

Under the stewardship of Tony Waddington, Stoke won the League Cup in 1972 with a 2–1 victory over Chelsea. Stoke had also been beaten finalists in 1964. The club spent fourteen years in the top-flight, and would secure promotion in 1978–79 after being relegated two years earlier. Stoke remained in the top-flight from 1979 to 1985, though were relegated to the Third Division in 1990. Having won the Football League Trophy in 1992, they were promoted as champions in 1992–93. Relegation in 1998 allowed the club to win another Football League Trophy title in 2000, before promotion was secured with victory in the 2002 play-off final. Manager Tony Pulis took Stoke into the Premier League at the end of the 2007–08 campaign. They played in the final of the FA Cup in 2011, finishing runners-up to Manchester City, which saw the club qualify for European football. Ten years of Premier League football culminated in relegation to the Championship in 2018.

==History==

===Formation and the early years (1863–1919)===

Although there are reports of the game being played in Stoke in 1863 and the club gives this as its official date of formation, the Stoke Ramblers club was formed in 1868 by Henry Almond, who had been a student at Charterhouse school where a dribbling form of the game was popular. Almond arrived in the region to become an apprentice with the North Staffordshire Railway Company and, wishing to continue playing the game that he had enjoyed whilst at school, established the first formal association football club in the region. The club&#x27;s first documented match was in October 1868, against a scratch team brought together for the occasion by E.W May. Harry Almond captained the Stoke Ramblers team and also scored the club&#x27;s first goal. The club&#x27;s first recorded away match was at Congleton, a rugby club that were convinced to play a one-off fixture under association rules, in December 1868. From the 1860s, the club played at the Victoria Cricket Club ground; however they switched to a nearby ground at Sweetings Field in 1875 to cope with rising attendances.
In 1870, after two seasons as the Ramblers, the club dropped the suffix from its title and became known as Stoke Football Club. It became closely aligned with Stoke Victoria Cricket Club, sharing facilities and some administrative responsibilities. The club played at the Athletic Club ground, which soon became known as the Victoria Ground. It was around this time that the club adopted their traditional red-and-white striped kit. In August 1885, the club turned professional.

Stoke were one of the twelve founding members of the Football League when it was introduced in 1888. The club struggled in their first two seasons, 1888–89 and 1889–90, finishing bottom on both occasions. In 1890 Stoke failed to be re-elected, the first club to do so, and joined the Football Alliance, which they won, and thus were re-elected to the Football League. Stoke spent the next 15 seasons in the First Division and reached the FA Cup semi-final in the 1898–99 season before being relegated in 1907 with severe financial problems. Stoke went bankrupt at the end of the 1907–08 season and entered non-league football, playing in the Birmingham &amp; District League and Southern League until 1915, when the First World War meant the Football League was suspended for four years. However, at the League&#x27;s Annual General Meeting of that year, Stoke was re-elected to the Second Division at the expense of Glossop. During the wartime period, Stoke entered the Lancashire Primary and Secondary leagues. When football recommenced in August 1919, Stoke was back in the league.

===Victoria Ground and Stanley Matthews (1919–1937)===
The club became owners of the Victoria Ground in 1919. This was followed by the construction of the Butler Street stand, which increased the overall capacity of the ground to 50,000. In 1925, Stoke-on-Trent was granted city status and this led the club to change its name to Stoke City F.C.

The 1930s saw the debut of club&#x27;s most celebrated player, Stanley Matthews. Matthews, who grew up in Hanley, was an apprentice at the club and made his first appearance in March 1932, against Bury, at the age of 17. By end of the decade, Matthews had established himself as an England international and as one of the best footballers of his generation. Stoke achieved promotion from the Second Division in 1932–33 – as champions – however Matthews only featured in fifteen games in this season. He did however score his first goal for the club in a 3–1 win against local rivals Port Vale.

By 1934, the club&#x27;s average attendance had risen to over 23,000, which in turn allowed the club to give the manager Tom Mather increased transfer funds. The club was now considered one of the top teams in the country. It was in this period that the club recorded its record league win, a 10–3 win over West Bromwich Albion in February 1937. In April of that year, the club achieved its record league crowd – 51,373 against Arsenal. Freddie Steele&#x27;s 33 league goals in the 1936–37 season remains a club record.

===Title challenge and league decline (1937–1960)===
Following the resumption of the FA Cup after World War II, tragedy struck on 9 March 1946, as 33 fans died and 520 were injured during a 6th round tie away against Bolton Wanderers. This came known as the Burnden Park disaster. In 1946–47, Stoke mounted a serious title challenge. The club needed a win in their final game of the season to win the First Division title. However, a 2–1 defeat to Sheffield United meant the title went to Liverpool instead. Stanley Matthews left with 3 games remaining of the 1946–47 season, opting to join Blackpool at the age of 32.

Stoke were relegated from the First Division in 1952–53; during the season Bob McGrory resigned as the club&#x27;s manager after 17 years in the role. Former Wolverhampton Wanderers defender Frank Taylor took over at the club looking to gain promotion back to the First Division. However, after seven seasons in the Second Division without promotion, Taylor was sacked. Taylor was shocked at being fired and vowed never to be associated with football again.

===Tony Waddington years (1960–1977)===
Tony Waddington was appointed as the club&#x27;s manager in June 1960. He joined the club in 1952 as a coach, before being promoted to assistant manager in 1957. Waddington pulled off a significant coup by enticing Stanley Matthews – then 46 years old – back to the club, 14 years after he had departed. The return of Matthews helped Stoke to an improved eighth position in 1961–62. Promotion was achieved in the following season, with Stoke finishing as champions. In their first season back in the top flight, 1963–64, the team celebrated its centenary and Waddington guided Stoke to a mid-table finish. Stoke reached the 1964 Football League Cup final, which they lost 4–3 to Leicester City over two legs.

Waddington counted on experience; Dennis Viollet, Jackie Mudie, Roy Vernon, Maurice Setters and Jimmy McIlroy were all players signed in the latter stages of their careers. Matthews was awarded a knighthood for services to football in the 1965 New Year&#x27;s Honours list. This was followed by his final appearance for the club against Fulham in February 1965, shortly after his 50th birthday. Gordon Banks, England&#x27;s 1966 World Cup-winning goalkeeper, joined in 1967 for £52,000 from Leicester. Regarded as the best goalkeeper in the world, Banks proved to be a shrewd signing for Waddington as he helped the club maintain stability in the First Division. During the close season of 1967, Stoke City played in the one-off United Soccer Association which imported clubs from Europe and South America. Stoke played as the Cleveland Stokers and finished as runner-up of the Eastern Division.

The club won its first major trophy on 4 March 1972 in the League Cup final against Chelsea. Stoke won 2–1 in front of a crowd of 97,852 at Wembley with goals from Terry Conroy and George Eastham. Preceding this victory, Stoke had progressed through 11 games in order to reach the final. This included four games with West Ham United in the semi-final; the two-legged tie was replayed twice. Stoke fared well in the FA Cup; the club progressed to the semi-final stage in both the 1970–71 and 1971–72 seasons. However, on both occasions Stoke lost to Arsenal in a replay. Stoke also competed in the UEFA Cup in 1972 and 1974 losing at the first attempt to 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Ajax respectively.

In January 1976, the roof of the Butler Street Stand was blown off in a storm. The repair bill of nearly £250,000 put the club in financial trouble; key players such as Alan Hudson, Mike Pejic and Jimmy Greenhoff were sold to cover the repairs. With the team depleted, Stoke were relegated in the 1976–77 season. Waddington, after a spell of 17 years in charge, left the club after a 1–0 home defeat to Leicester in March 1977.

===Managerial roundabout (1977–1997)===
Waddington&#x27;s replacement, George Eastham, left in January 1978 after only ten months in charge, and was replaced by Alan Durban from Shrewsbury Town. Durban achieved promotion to the First Division in the 1978–79 season, but after consolidating the club&#x27;s position in the First Division, he left to manage Sunderland in 1981. Richie Barker was appointed for the 1981–82 season, but was sacked in December 1983 and was replaced by Bill Asprey. Asprey decided to bring back veteran Alan Hudson, and the decision paid off as an improved second half of the season saw Stoke avoid relegation on the final day of the 1983–84 season.

The 1984–85 season proved to be disastrous. Stoke finished the season with only 17 points, with just three wins all season. Mick Mills was appointed player-manager for the 1985–86 season, but was unable to sustain a challenge for promotion in his four seasons as manager and was sacked in November 1989. His successor, Alan Ball Jr., became the club&#x27;s fifth manager in ten years. Ball struggled in his first season in charge, 1989–90, and Stoke were relegated to the third tier of English football after finishing bottom of the Second Division. Ball kept his job for the start of the following season, 1990–91, but departed during February 1991, in an indifferent season that saw Stoke finish 14th in the Third Division, Stoke&#x27;s lowest league position.

Ball&#x27;s successor, Lou Macari, was appointed in May 1991, prior to the start of the 1991–92 season. He clinched silverware for the club; the 1992 Football League Trophy was won with a 1–0 victory against Stockport County at Wembley, with Mark Stein scoring the only goal of the match. The following season, 1992–93, promotion was achieved from the third tier. Macari left for his boyhood club Celtic in October 1993 to be replaced by Joe Jordan; Stein also departed, in a club record £1.5 million move to Chelsea. Jordan&#x27;s tenure in charge was short, leaving the club less than a year after joining, and Stoke opted to re-appoint Lou Macari only 12 months after he had left. Stoke finished fourth in 1995–96 but were defeated in the play-off semi-final by Leicester City. Macari left the club at the end of the following season. His last match in charge was the final league game at the Victoria Ground. Mike Sheron, who was signed two years previously from Norwich City, was sold for a club record fee of £2.5 million in 1997.

===Britannia Stadium and the Icelandic takeover (1997–2008)===
1997–98 saw Stoke move to its new ground, the Britannia Stadium, after 119 years at the Victoria Ground. Chic Bates, Macari&#x27;s assistant, was appointed manager for the club&#x27;s first season in the new ground. He did not last long though, and was replaced by Chris Kamara in January 1998. Kamara could not improve the club&#x27;s fortunes either, and he too left in April. Alan Durban, previously Stoke&#x27;s manager two decades earlier, took charge for the remainder of season. Despite his best efforts, Durban was unable to keep the club up, as defeat against Manchester City on the final day of the season consigned Stoke to relegation to the third tier.

Brian Little, formerly manager of Aston Villa, took charge for the 1998–99 season. Despite an impressive start, the team&#x27;s form tailed off dramatically in the latter stages of the season, which led to Little leaving the club at the end of the season. His successor, Gary Megson, was only in the job for four months. Megson was forced to depart following a takeover by Stoke Holding, an Icelandic consortium, who purchased a 66% share in Stoke City F.C. for £6.6 million. Stoke became the first Icelandic-owned football club outside of Iceland. They appointed the club&#x27;s first foreign manager, Guðjón Þórðarson, who helped Stoke win the Football League Trophy in the 1999–2000 season, with a 2–1 win over Bristol City in front of a crowd of 85,057 at Wembley.

Guðjón achieved promotion at the third time of asking in 2001–02 after previous play-off defeats against Gillingham and Walsall. Cardiff City were defeated in the semi-final before a 2–0 win against Brentford at the Millennium Stadium secured promotion. Despite achieving the goal of promotion, Guðjón was sacked by Gunnar Gíslason just five days later.

Steve Cotterill was drafted in as Guðjón&#x27;s replacement prior to the start of the 2002–03 season, but resigned in October 2002 after only four months in charge. Tony Pulis was appointed as Stoke&#x27;s new manager shortly after. Pulis steered Stoke clear of relegation, with a 1–0 win over Reading on the final day of the season keeping the club in the division. However, Pulis was sacked at the end of the 2004–05 season, following disagreement between himself and the club&#x27;s owners.

Dutch manager Johan Boskamp was named as Pulis&#x27; successor on 29 June 2005, only one day after Pulis was sacked. Boskamp brought in a number of new players from Europe, but his side was inconsistent and only a mid-table finish was achieved. Boskamp left at the end of the 2005–06 season amidst a takeover bid by former chairman Peter Coates. On 23 May 2006, Coates completed his takeover of Stoke City, marking the end of Gunnar Gíslason&#x27;s chairmanship of the club. Coates chose former manager Tony Pulis as Boskamp&#x27;s successor in June 2006. Pulis took Stoke close to a play-off place, but an eventual eighth-place finish was achieved in the 2006–07 season.

===Ten years in the Premier League (2008–2018)===
Stoke won automatic promotion to the Premier League on the final day of the 2007–08 season, finishing in second place in the Championship. A 3–1 defeat to Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2008–09 season saw Stoke written off by many media outlets as relegation certainties. Stoke managed to turn the Britannia Stadium into a &quot;fortress&quot;, making it difficult for teams to pick up points there. In their first home match, Stoke defeated Aston Villa 3–2, and wins also came against Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Sunderland and West Bromwich Albion. After a 2–1 win at Hull City, Stoke confirmed their place in the Premier League as the &quot;Potters&quot; finished 12th in their return to the top flight, with a total of 45 points. Stoke finished the following 2009–10 season in a respectable 11th place, with 47 points. Stoke also made it to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 1972, defeating York City, Arsenal and Manchester City before losing out to eventual winners Chelsea.

Stoke reached the FA Cup final for the first time in 2011, beating Cardiff City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, West Ham United and a famous 5–0 win against Bolton, the largest post-war FA Cup semi-final victory. However, they lost the final 1–0 to Manchester City. By reaching the final, Stoke qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League. In the Europa League, Stoke advanced past Hajduk Split, Thun and a tough group containing Beşiktaş, Dynamo Kyiv and Maccabi Tel Aviv which Stoke managed to progress through finishing in second position. City&#x27;s reward was a tie against Spanish giants Valencia and despite putting up a spirited second leg performance, Stoke went out 2–0 on aggregate. In the Premier League, Stoke made the high-profile signing of Peter Crouch as they finished in a mid-table position for a fourth time. The 2012–13 season saw Stoke make little progress, and Pulis left the club by mutual consent on 21 May 2013.

Pulis was replaced by fellow Welshman Mark Hughes, who signed a three-year contract on 30 May 2013. Hughes led Stoke to a ninth-place finish in 2013–14, their highest position in the Premier League and best finish since 1974–75. The 2014–15 season saw Stoke again finish in ninth position this time, with 54 points. Despite breaking their transfer record twice on Xherdan Shaqiri and then Giannelli Imbula, in 2015–16, Stoke did not make any progress and finished in ninth position for a third season running. Stoke declined in 2016–17, finishing in 13th position. In January 2018, Hughes was sacked after a poor run left the club in the relegation zone. He was replaced by Paul Lambert, who could not prevent the club ending their 10-year spell in the Premier League.

===Return to the Championship (2018–present)===
Following their relegation to the Championship, Lambert was replaced with former Derby County boss Gary Rowett. Despite spending nearly £50 million on players in the summer transfer window, results and performances were poor and Rowett was subsequently sacked on 8 January 2019 with the team 14th in the table. He was replaced with Luton Town boss Nathan Jones. Stoke went on to end an uneventful 2018–19 season in 16th place with a record number of draws (22).

After achieving just two wins in the opening 14 games of the following season, Jones was sacked on 1 November 2019 with the team in the relegation zone. Northern Ireland boss Michael O&#x27;Neill was confirmed as his replacement a week later. Results improved under O&#x27;Neill and the team managed to avoid relegation, finishing in 15th. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the entire 2020–21 campaign was played without supporters present as Stoke again finished in mid-table. The following campaign started brightly with the team challenging for the playoffs, though a poor finish to the season saw them finish in 14th. A slow start to the 2022–23 season marked the end for O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s time in charge and he was dismissed in August 2022, with Sunderland boss Alex Neil replacing him. Neil was unable to end Stoke&#x27;s mid-table positioning and was replaced by Plymouth Argyle&#x27;s Steven Schumacher in December 2023, who lasted less than a year in charge before also being sacked in September 2024. Narcís Pèlach was announced as Stoke&#x27;s new manager on 18 September 2024, but was sacked in December 2024; Mark Robins was appointed as manager on 1 January 2025.

==Stadium==
It is not clear where Stoke&#x27;s original playing fields were located. Their first pitch was certainly in the site of a present burial ground in Lonsdale Street, although there is evidence that they also played on land near to the Copeland Arms public house on Campbell Road. In 1875, they moved to Sweetings Field, which was owned by the mayor of Stoke, Alderman Sweeting. It is estimated that as many as 200–250 spectators were attending home matches at Sweetings Field, paying one penny for admission. Stoke were to stay at Sweetings Field until a merger with the Stoke Victoria Cricket Club in March 1878, when Stoke moved to the Victoria Ground.

The first match to be played at the Victoria Ground was the inaugural Staffordshire Cup final against Talke Rangers on 28 March 1878, Stoke won 1–0 in front of 2,500 fans with the goal scored by William Boddington at about the 80th minute. The ground was originally an oval shape to cater for athletics, and this shape was retained for the next 30 years. Major development work began in the 1920s, and by 1930 the ground had lost its original shape. By 1935, the ground capacity was up to 50,000. A record crowd of 51,380 packed into the Ground on 29 March 1937 to watch a league match against Arsenal.

Floodlights were installed in 1956 and another new main stand was built. Over the weekend of the 3/4 in January 1976, gale-force winds blew the roof off the Butler Street Stand. Stoke played a home League match against Middlesbrough at Vale Park whilst repair work was on-going. The Stoke End Stand was improved in 1979 and through the 1980s more improvements were made. By 1995, Stoke drew up plans to make the ground an all seater stadium, to comply with the Taylor Report. However, the club decided it would be better to leave the Victoria Ground and re-locate to a new site.

In 1997, Stoke left the Victoria Ground after 119 years, and moved to the modern 28,384 all seater Britannia Stadium at a cost of £14.7 million. Stoke struggled at first to adjust to their new surroundings and were relegated to the third tier in the first season at the new ground. In 2002, a record 28,218 attended an FA Cup match against Everton. With Stoke gaining promotion to the Premier League in 2008, attendances increased. However, the capacity was reduced to 27,500 due to segregation. The name of the ground was changed to the bet365 Stadium in June 2016. Work began on expanding the stadium to over 30,000 in February 2017 and was concluded in the summer of 2017.

==Supporters==

While much of the support that the club enjoys is from the local Stoke-on-Trent area, there are a number of exile fan clubs, notably in London and stretching from Scandinavia to countries farther afield such as Russia, Canada, the United States and Australia. A capacity crowd regularly turned out to see them in the Premier League.

Stoke have had problems with football hooliganism in the 1970s through the early 2000s, due to the actions of the &quot;Naughty Forty&quot; firm which associated itself with the club and was formed by supporter Mark Chester. Chester reformed himself and now works as a youth inclusion promoter. In 2003, the BBC described Stoke City as having &quot;one of the most active and organised football hooligan firms in England&quot;. In response to these criticisms, the club introduced an Away Travel ID scheme. It was subsequently suspended in 2008 as a result of improved behaviour and an enhanced reputation. More recently, Stoke City&#x27;s fans and stadium have been perceived as loud, friendly, passionate and modern, welcoming as guests Sugar Ray Leonard and Diego Maradona. There is in the media now &quot;genuine admiration for the volume and volatility of the club&#x27;s loyal support&quot;. Stoke announced that they would offer supporters free bus travel to every Premier League away game in the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons.

In November 2008, a group of Stoke fans was forced by the Greater Manchester Police to leave Manchester before a league match against Manchester United. The human rights group Liberty took up their case, and the Greater Manchester police eventually apologised for their actions and the fans received compensation.

Supporters of the club have adopted &quot;Delilah&quot; as their anthem since the 1970s, when a supporter was heard singing it in a local pub. Some of the song&#x27;s lyrics have been adapted for the terraces, but most remain the same. Stoke&#x27;s official club anthem is &quot;We&#x27;ll be with you&quot;, which was recorded by the Stoke players prior to the 1972 Football League Cup final.

Between 2008 and 2011, local fan &quot;Pottermouth&quot; contributed a series of raps to BBC Radio Stoke about Stoke&#x27;s promotion, their battle to stay in the Premier League, and the 2011 FA Cup final.

==Rivalries==
Stoke&#x27;s local rivals are Port Vale, based in the Burslem area of Stoke-on-Trent. As the two clubs have regularly been in different divisions, there have only been 46 league matches between the two sides, with the last match being in 2002. Regardless of the lack of matches, the Potteries derby is often a tight and close game of football with few goals being scored. Stoke have won 19 matches while Vale have won 15.

Due to the rarity of this fixture, Stoke have more established rivalries with Midlands clubs Derby County, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers. A rivalry with Welsh side Cardiff City was formed in the 2001–02 season where the sides played each other in the Second Division play-offs.

==Kit and crest==

===Kit===

Stoke&#x27;s traditional kit is red and white striped shirts with white shorts and socks. Their first strip was navy and cardinal hoops with white knickerbockers and hooped stockings. This changed to black and blue hoops before the club settled on red and white stripes in 1883. However, in 1891 the Football League decided that only one club could use one style of strip &quot;per&quot; season and Sunderland were allowed to take red and white stripes. So between 1891 and 1908 Stoke used a variety of kits with plain maroon being the most common. In 1908, Stoke lost their League status and were able to finally revert to red and white and when they re-joined the league in 1919 the rule was scrapped. Since then, Stoke have forever used red and white striped shirts, with the only time when they diverted from this was for two seasons in the mid-1980s, which saw them wear a pin-striped shirt.

===Crest===
Stoke&#x27;s first club crest was a stylised &quot;S&quot; which was used by players in 1882 who would stitch the crest on to their shirts; however, this practice soon faded away. In the 1950s Stoke began using the shield from the Stoke-on-Trent coat-of-arms which was used infrequently until 1977. A new and simpler club crest was introduced a Stafford knot and pottery kiln represented local tradition while red and white stripes were also added. This lasted until 1992 when the club decided to use the entire Stoke-on-Trent coat-of-arms which included the club&#x27;s name at the top of the crest. They changed their crest in 2001 to the current version which includes their nickname &quot;The Potters&quot;. For the 2012–13 season, they used a special version to mark the club&#x27;s 150th anniversary which included the club&#x27;s Latin motto &quot;Vis Unita Fortior&quot; (&quot;United Strength is Stronger&quot;).

<text>In music, the subdominant is the fourth tonal degree () of the diatonic scale. It is so called because it is the same distance &quot;below&quot; the tonic as the dominant is &quot;above&quot; the tonicin other words, the tonic is the dominant of the subdominant. It also happens to be the note one step below the dominant. In the movable do solfège system, the subdominant note is sung as &quot;fa&quot;.

The triad built on the subdominant note is called the subdominant chord. In Roman numeral analysis, the subdominant chord is typically symbolized by the Roman numeral &quot;IV&quot; in a major key, indicating that the chord is a major triad. In a minor key, it is symbolized by &quot;iv&quot;, indicating that the chord is a minor triad.

These chords may also appear as seventh chords: in major, as IVM7, or in minor as iv7 or sometimes IV7:
&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble
 \time 4/4
 \key c \major
 &lt;f a c e&gt;1_\markup { \concat { &quot;IV&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;M7&quot; } } \bar &quot;||&quot;

 \clef treble
 \time 4/4
 \key c \minor
 &lt;f aes c es&gt;1_\markup { \concat { &quot;iv&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;7&quot; } }
 &lt;f a c es&gt;^\markup { \tiny { &quot;infrequent&quot; } }_\markup { \concat { &quot;IV&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;7&quot; } } \bar &quot;||&quot;
&lt;/score&gt;
A cadential subdominant chord followed by a tonic chord produces the so-called plagal cadence.

As with other chords which often precede the dominant, subdominant chords typically have predominant function. In Riemannian theory, it is considered to balance the dominant around the tonic (being as far below the tonic as the dominant is above).

The term &quot;subdominant&quot; may also refer to a relationship of musical keys. For example, relative to the key of C major, the key of F major is the subdominant. Music which modulates (changes key) often modulates to the subdominant when the leading tone is lowered by half step to the subtonic (B to B in the key of C). Modulation to the subdominant key often creates a sense of musical relaxation, as opposed to modulation to the dominant (fifth note of the scale), which increases tension.
