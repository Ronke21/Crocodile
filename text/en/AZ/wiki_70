<text>A Messier marathon is an attempt, usually organized by amateur astronomers, to find as many Messier objects as possible during one night. The Messier catalogue was compiled by French astronomer Charles Messier during the late 18th century and consists of 110 relatively bright deep-sky objects (galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters).

==When and where a marathon is possible==
The number of Messier objects visible in any one night varies depending on a few factors, including the location of the observer, the duration of daylight and nighttime, and the season (the positions of the Messier objects relative to the Sun varies with the season, as does the length of the night).

===Location===
Because Messier compiled his catalog from a northern latitude, not all of the Messier objects are visible from the southern hemisphere. In particular, M81, M82, M52, and M103 make southern-hemisphere Messier marathons difficult, because they are all located at a declination of 60° north or greater. Although a Messier marathon can be attempted from any northern latitude, low northern latitudes are best. In particular, a latitude of around 25° north lends the best possibility to complete a Messier marathon at the right time of year.

===Season===
At low northern latitudes, particularly around latitude 25° north, it is possible to observe all Messier objects in one night during a window of a few weeks from mid-March to early April. In that period the dark nights around the time of the new moon are best for a Messier marathon.

===Other times of year===
Less complete Messier marathons can be undertaken at other times of the year, with the actual quantity of Messier objects seen depending upon season and location. In particular, there is a short period around the autumnal equinox when most of the objects can be seen.

==The marathon==
The Messier Marathon was invented independently by American astronomers Tom Hoffelder, Donald Machholz, and Tom Reiland in the 1970s.
Typically an observer attempting a Messier marathon begins observing at sundown and will observe through the night until sunrise in order to see all 110 objects. An observer starts with objects low in the western sky at sunset, hoping to view them before they dip out of view, then works eastward across the sky. By sunrise, the successful observer will be observing the last few objects low on the eastern horizon, hoping to see them before the sky becomes too bright due to the rising sun. The evening can be a test of stamina and willpower depending on weather conditions and the physical fitness of the observer. Particularly crowded regions of the sky (namely, the Virgo Cluster and the Milky Way&#x27;s Galactic Center) can prove to be challenging to an observer as well, and a Messier marathon will generally budget time for these regions accordingly.

==Organized marathons==

Marathons are typically organized by a local astronomy organization or astronomical society as a special type of star party. These are usually attempted at least once every year. Some clubs issue certificates/awards either for participation or for achieving a set number of objects.

<doc id="207848" wikidata="Q11681141" url="?curid=207848" title="Tutelary deity">
<text>A tutelary (; also tutelar) is a deity or a spirit who is a guardian, patron, or protector of a particular place, geographic feature, person, lineage, nation, culture, or occupation. The etymology of &quot;tutelary&quot; expresses the concept of safety and thus of guardianship.

In late Greek and Roman religion, one type of tutelary deity, the &quot;genius&quot;, functions as the personal deity or &quot;daimon&quot; of an individual from birth to death. Another form of personal tutelary spirit is the familiar spirit of European folklore.

==Ancient Greece==

Socrates spoke of hearing the voice of his personal spirit or &quot;daimonion&quot;:
The Greeks also thought deities guarded specific places: for instance, Athena was the patron goddess of the city of Athens.

==Ancient Rome==
Tutelary deities who guard and preserve a place or a person are fundamental to ancient Roman religion. The tutelary deity of a man was his Genius, that of a woman her Juno. In the Imperial era, the Genius of the Emperor was a focus of Imperial cult. An emperor might also adopt a major deity as his personal patron or tutelary, as Augustus did Apollo. Precedents for claiming the personal protection of a deity were established in the Republican era, when for instance the Roman dictator Sulla advertised the goddess Victory as his tutelary by holding public games &quot;(ludi)&quot; in her honor.

Each town or city had one or more tutelary deities, whose protection was considered particularly vital in time of war and siege. Rome itself was protected by a goddess whose name was to be kept ritually secret on pain of death (for a supposed case, see Quintus Valerius Soranus). The Capitoline Triad of Juno, Jupiter, and Minerva were also tutelaries of Rome.

The Italic towns had their own tutelary deities. Juno often had this function, as at the Latin town of Lanuvium and the Etruscan city of Veii, and was often housed in an especially grand temple on the &quot;arx&quot; (citadel) or other prominent or central location. The tutelary deity of Praeneste was Fortuna, whose oracle was renowned.

The Roman ritual of &quot;evocatio&quot; was premised on the belief that a town could be made vulnerable to military defeat if the power of its tutelary deity were diverted outside the city, perhaps by the offer of superior cult at Rome. The depiction of some goddesses such as the &quot;Magna Mater&quot; (Great Mother, or Cybele) as &quot;tower-crowned&quot; represents their capacity to preserve the city.

A town in the provinces might adopt a deity from within the Roman religious sphere to serve as its guardian, or syncretize its own tutelary with such; for instance, a community within the &quot;civitas&quot; of the Remi in Gaul adopted Apollo as its tutelary, and at the capital of the Remi (present-day Rheims), the tutelary was Mars Camulus.
Tutelary deities were also attached to sites of a much smaller scale, such as storerooms, crossroads, and granaries. Each Roman home had a set of protective deities: the Lar or Lares of the household or &quot;familia&quot;, whose shrine was a &quot;lararium&quot;; the Penates who guarded the storeroom &quot;(penus)&quot; of the innermost part of the house; Vesta, whose sacred site in each house was the hearth; and the Genius of the &quot;paterfamilias&quot;, the head of household. The poet Martial lists the tutelary deities who watch over various aspects of his farm. The architecture of a granary &quot;(horreum)&quot; featured niches for images of the tutelary deities, who might include the &quot;genius loci&quot; or guardian spirit of the site, Hercules, Silvanus, Fortuna Conservatrix (&quot;Fortuna the Preserver&quot;) and in the Greek East Aphrodite and Agathe Tyche.

The &quot;Lares Compitales&quot; were the tutelary gods of a neighborhood &quot;(vicus)&quot;, each of which had a &quot;compitum&quot; (shrine) devoted to these. Their annual public festival was the Compitalia. During the Republic, the cult of local or neighborhood tutelaries sometimes became rallying points for political and social unrest.

==Indonesian folk religion==
Influenced by the religion of Islam, Indonesian people believe in jinn, particularly on the island of Java. Those jinn who adhere to the religion of Islam are generally benevolent, however, non-Muslim jinn are considered to be mischievous. Some of them guard graves. If a pilgrim approaching the grave has evil intentions, they would cause severe illness or even death.

==Judaism==
Spirits called &quot;shedim&quot; are mentioned twice in the Hebrew Bible. In both of these instances (Psalm 106:37 and Deuteronomy 32:17) the &quot;shedim&quot; are associated with child sacrifice or animal sacrifice. The term &quot;shedim&quot; is believed by some to be a loan-word from the Akkadian &quot;shedu&quot;, which referred to a spirit which could be either protective or malevolent.

==Korean shamanism==
In Korean shamanism, &quot;jangseung&quot; and &quot;sotdae&quot; were placed at the edge of villages to frighten off demons. They were also worshiped as deities. Seonangshin is the patron deity of the village in Korean tradition and was believed to embody the Seonangdang.

==Shinto==

In Shinto, the spirits, or &quot;kami&quot;, which give life to human bodies come from nature and return to it after death. Ancestors are therefore themselves tutelaries to be worshiped.

Some tutelary deities are known to exist in Slavic Europe, a more prominent example being that of the Leshy.

==Thai religion==

* Thai provincial capitals have tutelary city pillars and palladiums. The guardian spirit of a house is known as &quot;Chao Thi&quot; (เจ้าที่) or &quot;Phra Phum&quot; (พระภูมิ). Almost every traditional household in Thailand has a miniature shrine housing this tutelary deity, known as a spirit house.

<text>New German Cinema () is a period in West German cinema which lasted from 1962 to 1982, in which a new generation of directors emerged who, working with low budgets, and influenced by the French New Wave and Italian Neorealism, gained notice by producing a number of &quot;small&quot; motion pictures that caught the attention of art house audiences. These filmmakers included Percy Adlon, Harun Farocki, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Peter Fleischmann, Werner Herzog, Alexander Kluge, Ulli Lommel, Wolfgang Petersen, Volker Schlöndorff, Helma Sanders-Brahms, Werner Schroeter, Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, Margarethe von Trotta and Wim Wenders. As a result of the attention they garnered, they were able (particularly in the case of Wenders, Petersen, and Schlöndorff) to create better-financed productions which were backed by the big US studios. However, most of these larger films were commercial failures and the movement was heavily dependent on subsidies. By 1977, 80% of a budget for a typical West German film was ensured by a subsidy.

Most of the directors of the New German Cinema movement were members of their self-owned Filmverlag der Autoren association founded in 1971, which funded and distributed most of their films, and the history of New German Cinema from the 1970s onwards was largely synonymous with it.

==History==

As a reaction to the artistic and economic stagnation of West German cinema, a group of young filmmakers issued the Oberhausen Manifesto on 28 February 1962. This call to arms, which included Alexander Kluge, Edgar Reitz, Peter Schamoni, Haro Senft and Franz-Josef Spieker among its signatories, provocatively declared &quot;Der alte Film ist tot. Wir glauben an den neuen&quot; (&quot;The old cinema is dead. We believe in the new cinema&quot;). Other younger filmmakers allied themselves to this Oberhausen group, among them Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Jean-Marie Straub, Wim Wenders, Hans-Jürgen Syberberg and Rainer Werner Fassbinder in their rejection of the existing West German film industry and their determination to build a new industry founded on artistic excellence rather than commercial dictates.

Despite the foundation of the &quot;Kuratorium Junger Deutscher Film&quot; (Young German Film Committee) in 1965, set up under the auspices of the Federal Ministry of the Interior to support new West German films financially, the directors of this New German Cinema, who rejected co-operation with the existing film industry, were consequently often dependent on money from television. Young filmmakers had the opportunity to test their mettle in such programmes as the stand-alone drama and documentary series &quot;Das kleine Fernsehspiel&quot; (&quot;The Little TV Play&quot;) or the television films of the crime series &quot;Tatort&quot;. However, the broadcasters sought TV premieres for the films which they had supported financially, with theatrical showings only occurring later. As a consequence, such films tended to be unsuccessful at the cinema box-office.

This situation changed after 1974 when the &quot;Film-Fernseh-Abkommen&quot; (Film and Television Accord) was agreed between the Federal Republic&#x27;s main broadcasters, ARD and ZDF, and the German Federal Film Board (a government body created in 1968 to support film-making in West Germany). This accord, which has been repeatedly extended up to the present day, provides for the television companies to make available an annual sum to support the production of films which are suitable for both theatrical distribution and television presentation (the amount of money provided by the public broadcasters has varied between €4.5 and 12.94 million per year). Under the terms of the accord, films produced using these funds can only be screened on television 24 months after their theatrical release. They may appear on video or DVD no sooner than six months after cinema release. As a result of the funds provided by the &quot;Film-Fernseh-Abkommen&quot;, German films, particularly those of the New German Cinema, gained a much greater opportunity to enjoy box-office success before they played on television.

The artistically ambitious and socially critical films of the New German Cinema strove to delineate themselves from what had gone before and the works of auteur filmmakers such as Kluge and Fassbinder are examples of this, although Fassbinder in his use of stars from West German cinema history also sought a reconciliation between the new cinema and the old. In addition, a distinction is sometimes drawn between the avantgarde &quot;Young German Cinema&quot; of the 1960s and the more accessible &quot;New German Cinema&quot; of the 1970s. For their influences, the new generation of filmmakers looked to Italian Neorealism, the French &quot;Nouvelle Vague&quot; and the British New Wave but combined this eclectically with references to the well-established genres of Hollywood cinema. The new movement saw German cinema return to international critical significance for the first time since the end of the Weimar Republic. Films such as Kluge&#x27;s &quot;Abschied von gestern&quot; (&quot;Yesterday Girl&quot;, 1966), Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot; (1972), Fassbinder&#x27;s &quot;Fear Eats the Soul&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Marriage of Maria Braun&quot; (1979), and Wenders&#x27; &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984) found international acclaim and critical approval. Often the work of these auteurs was first recognised abroad rather than in West Germany itself. The work of post-war Germany&#x27;s leading novelists Heinrich Böll and Günter Grass provided source material for the adaptations &quot;The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum&quot; (1975) (by Schlöndorff and Margarethe von Trotta) and &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; (1979) (by Schlöndorff alone) respectively, the latter becoming the first German film to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Although overlooked in early scholarship on New German Cinema, female directors were an important part of it, which encompassed the works of directors such as Danièle Huillet, Helma Sanders-Brahms, Helke Sander, and von Trotta. Rosa von Praunheim, who formed the German lesbian and gay movement with his film &quot;It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, But the Society in Which He Lives&quot; (1971), can also be counted to the movement.

<text>Nuclear artillery is a subset of limited-yield tactical nuclear weapons, in particular those weapons that are launched from the ground at battlefield targets. Nuclear artillery is commonly associated with shells delivered by a cannon, but in a technical sense short-range artillery rockets or tactical ballistic missiles are also included.

The development of nuclear artillery was part of a broad push by nuclear weapons countries to develop nuclear weapons which could be used tactically against enemy armies in the field (as opposed to strategic uses against cities, military bases, and heavy industry). Nuclear artillery was both developed and deployed by a small group of states, including the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. The United Kingdom planned and partially developed such weapon systems (the Blue Water missile and the Yellow Anvil artillery shell) but did not put them into production.

A second group of states has derivative association with nuclear artillery. These nations fielded artillery units trained and equipped to use nuclear weapons, but did not control the devices themselves. Instead, the devices were held by embedded custodial units of the developing countries. These custodial units retained control of the nuclear weapons until they were released for use in a crisis. This second group has included such North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) countries as Belgium, Canada, West Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.

Today, nuclear artillery has been almost entirely replaced with mobile tactical ballistic missile launchers, carrying missiles with nuclear warheads.

==The United States==

United States developments resulted in nuclear weapons for various artillery systems. After the short-lived M65 Atomic Cannon, standard howitzers were used. Delivery systems include, in approximate order of development:
* MGR-1 Honest John free flight rocket delivering W7 and later W31 nuclear weapons, 1953–1985.
* M65 Atomic Cannon delivering 280mm W9 and W19 nuclear shells, 1953–1963.
* MGM-5 Corporal missile delivering W7 nuclear weapon, 1955–1964.
* 16&quot;/50 caliber Mark 7 gun on the Iowa-class battleship delivering 406 mm W23 nuclear shells, 1956–1962.
* PGM-11 Redstone missile delivering the W39 nuclear weapon, 1958–1964
* M110 howitzer and M115 howitzer delivering 203mm W33 nuclear shell, 1957–1992.
* M-28/M-29 Davy Crockett (nuclear device) M-388 warhead derived from W54, 1961–1971.
* MGR-3 Little John free flight rocket delivering W45 nuclear weapon, 1962–1969.
* MGM-18 Lacrosse missile with W40 nuclear warhead, 1959–1964.
* M109 self-propelled, M114 towed howitzers and M198 towed howitzers delivering 155mm W48, 1963–1992.
* MGM-29 Sergeant missile delivering W52 nuclear weapon, 1962–1979.
* MGM-31 Pershing missile delivering W50 nuclear weapon, 1962–1969 for Pershing 1, 1969–1991 for Pershing 1a.
* MGM-52 Lance missile delivering W70 nuclear weapon, 1972–1992.
* M110 howitzer and M115 howitzer delivering 203mm W79 nuclear shell, 1976–1992.
* Pershing II missile delivering W85 nuclear warhead, 1983–1991.
* 155mm W82 nuclear artillery shell, cancelled. Likely would have been delivered by M109 self-propelled, M114 towed howitzers and M198 towed howitzers.
The first artillery test was on May 25, 1953, at the Nevada Test Site. Fired as part of Operation Upshot–Knothole and codenamed &quot;Shot GRABLE&quot;, a 280 mm (11 inch) shell with a gun-type fission warhead was fired 10,000 m (6.2 miles) and detonated 160 m (525 ft) above the ground with an estimated yield of 15 kilotons. This was the only nuclear artillery shell ever actually fired in the U.S. nuclear weapons test program. The shell was 1,384 mm (4.5 ft) long and weighed 365 kg (805 lb). It was fired from a special, very large artillery piece, nicknamed &quot;Atomic Annie&quot;, built by the Artillery Test Unit of Fort Sill, Oklahoma. About 3,200 soldiers and civilians were present. The warhead was designated the W9 nuclear warhead and 80 were produced in 1952 to 1953 for the T-124 shell. It was retired in 1957.

Development work continued and resulted in the W19, a 280 mm shell, a longer version of the W9. Only 80 warheads were produced and the system was retired in 1963 coinciding with the introduction of the W48 warhead.

The W48 was long and weighed ; it was in a 155 mm M-45 AFAP (artillery fired atomic projectile) for firing from standard 155 mm howitzer. The fission warhead was a linear implosion type, consisting of a long cylinder of subcritical fissile material which is compressed and shaped by explosive into a supercritical sphere. The W48 yielded an explosive force of just 100 tons of TNT.

The W48 went into production beginning in 1963, and 135 Mod 0 version projectiles were produced by 1968 when it was replaced by the Mod 1. The Mod 1 was manufactured from 1965 through 1969. 925 of these were produced.

Only one type of artillery round other than the W48 was produced in large numbers. It was the W33 nuclear warhead for use in an artillery shell. About 2,000 of these warheads were produced from 1957 to 1965. Each XM422 projectile was long, it had a projectile weight of XM422 were fitted with a triple-deck mechanical time-base fuze. They were to be fired from a standard eight-inch howitzer, if the use of this weapon had ever been called for.
The W33&#x27;s four explosive yields were all greater than that of the W48. M422 projectiles were hand-assembled in the field to provide the required yield, three yielding 5 to 10 kilotons and one with 40 kilotons. There was also a ballistically matched spotting round (HES M424) and a special white bag charge system, M80, composed of charges one through three. The M423 ordnance training rounds and their associated &quot;bird cages&quot; can be seen at the National Atomic Museum in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Efforts were made to update the warheads: the 155 mm W74 and 203 mm W75 were developed from about 1970, and they were intended to have a yield of 100 tons or more. These versions were canceled in 1973. A further development program began in the 1980s: the W82, for the XM-785 (a 155 mm shell), was intended to yield up to two kilotons with an enhanced radiation capability. Its development was halted in 1983. A W82-1 fission-only type was designed but was canceled in 1990.

Other developments also continued. In 1958 a fusion warhead was developed and tested, the &quot;UCRL Swift&quot;. It was long, diameter, and weighed . At its test, it yielded only 190 tons; it failed to achieve fusion, and only the initial fission explosion worked correctly. There are unconfirmed reports that work on similar concepts continued into the 1970s and resulted in a one-kiloton warhead design for 5-inch (127 mm) naval gun rounds; these, however, were never deployed as operational weapons.

In 1991, the US unilaterally withdrew its nuclear artillery shells from service, and Russia responded in kind in 1992. The US removed around 1,300 nuclear shells from Europe and reportedly dismantled its last shells by 2004. Focus has since moved to the development of nuclear bunker buster munitions.

==The Soviet Union==
The Soviet Union&#x27;s nuclear artillery was operated by the rocket troops and artillery branch of the Soviet ground forces. Delivery units were organic to tank and motor rifle divisions and higher echelons. The control and custody of nuclear weapons was the responsibility of the 12th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense and its special units.

The Soviet Union developed and eventually deployed both rocket- and projectile-type nuclear artillery systems. The first system developed was the SM-54 (2А3) 406 mm gun, nicknamed &quot;Kondensator&quot; (Russian: Конденсатор, &quot;Capacitor&quot;); this was released in 1956. A 420 mm breech-loading smoothbore self-propelled mortar, 2B1 Oka or &quot;Transformator&quot; (Russian: Трансформатор; &quot;Transformer&quot;) was produced in 1957. Testing revealed critical operational defects in both systems and they were not put into full production. The purpose-built weapons suffered from the same deficiencies of the American M-65 Nuclear Cannon to which they are analogous; large, unwieldy, and quickly obsolete.

Meanwhile, rocket- and missile-based delivery systems were concurrently developed. The original systems (the T7 &quot;Scud&quot;, the FROG-1 and successors) were first introduced in the late 1950s. Development continued on missile based systems:
* T5 Luna (NATO FROG family) free flight rocket 
* T7 (NATO SS-1 Scud) missile
* TR-1 Temp (NATO SS-12 Scaleboard) missile
* OTR-21 Tochka (NATO SS-21 Scarab) missile
* OTR-23 Oka (NATO SS-23 Spider) missile

After the abortive effort with purpose-built artillery pieces, the Soviet approach to nuclear artillery was that nuclear munitions should be fired by standard guns and howitzers (without modification) in normal artillery units. The first nuclear weapon for use from standard 152 mm artillery, called 3BV3, was finally accepted in 1965. Subsequent weapon designs followed using existing and new technology: 
* 152 mm projectile 3BV3 for self-propelled guns 2S19 Msta-S, 2S3 Akatsiya, 2S5 Giatsint-S, towed gun D-20, 2A36 Giatsint-B, and 2A65 Msta-B. The yield was 1 kiloton, maximum range . The nuclear weapon was designated RFYAC-VNIITF and designed by Academician E. I. Zababakhin in Snezhinsk.
* 180 mm projectile 3BV1 for S-23, MK-3-180 (originally a coast artillery piece), maximum range .
* 203 mm projectile 3BV2 for self-propelled gun 2S7 Pion, and towed howitzer B-4M, range from .
* 240 mm projectile 3BV4 for mortar M-240 and self-propelled 2S4 Tyulpan. Normal maximum range and with rocket assistance.

At the end of the Cold War, Russia followed the United States lead and deactivated its nuclear artillery units in 1993. By 2000, Russia reported that nearly all nuclear artillery shells and missile warheads had been destroyed.

==France==

France&#x27;s nuclear artillery was provided by Artillery Regiments equipped with the Pluton missile system from 1975 to 1993 and with its successor, the longer-ranged Hadès missile, from 1991 to 1996.

==NATO==

Belgium, Canada, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United Kingdom provided artillery units trained in the correct handling and operation of nuclear weapons and in some cases specialist logistic and security units. Their allocated nuclear weapons were in the custody of US Army Artillery Groups (USAAG) with subordinate US Army Field Artillery Detachments (USAFAD) assigned to the national artillery units. The Groups were part of the 59th Ordnance Brigade.

At various times these artillery units operated: 
* MGR-1 Honest John free flight rocket 
* MGM-5 Corporal missile 
* MGM-29 Sergeant missile 
* MGM-52 Lance missile 
* 8-inch (203 mm) howitzer M1, M15, M110, M110A1, M110A2 firing the W33 nuclear artillery shell 
* 155 mm howitzer M109, M109A1, M109A2 and M109G firing the W48 nuclear artillery shell 
* Pershing 1 and Pershing 1a missiles were operated by the German Air Force

===Italy===

Nuclear artillery was provided by Artillery Groups equipped with the MGR-1 Honest John free flight rockets, MGM-52 Lance missiles, and 8-inch (203 mm) howitzers.

The Italian units were (links in Italian):
* 3rd Missile Brigade &quot;Aquileia&quot;
** 3rd Missile Artillery Group &quot;Volturno&quot;
** 1st Heavy Artillery Group &quot;Adige&quot;
** 9th Heavy Artillery Group &quot;Rovigo&quot;
** 27th Heavy Self-propelled Artillery Group &quot;Marche&quot;

===The Netherlands===

Nuclear artillery was provided by two Artillery Groups.

<doc id="207858" wikidata="Q749418" url="?curid=207858" title="Sweden Finns">
<text>Sweden Finns (; ) are a Finnish-speaking national minority in Sweden.

People with Finnish heritage comprise a relatively large share of the population of Sweden. In addition to a smaller part of Sweden Finns historically residing in Sweden, there were about 426,000 people in Sweden (4.46% of the total population in 2012) who were either born in Finland or had at least one parent who was born in Finland. In 2017 that number was 720,000. Like the Swedish language, the Finnish language has been spoken on both sides of the Gulf of Bothnia since the late Middle Ages. Following military campaigns in Finland by Sweden in the 13th century, Finland gradually came under Swedish rule and Finns in Finland and Sweden became subjugates of Sweden. Already in the 1400s, a sizeable population of Stockholm spoke Finnish, and around 4% in the 1700s. Finland remained a part of Sweden until 1809 when the peace after the Finnish War handed Finland to the Russian Empire, leaving Finnish populations on the Swedish side of the Torne river.

In the 1940s, 70,000 young Finnish children were evacuated from Finland. Most of them came to Sweden during the Winter War and the Continuation War, and around 20% remained after the war. Helped by the Nordic Passport Union, Finnish immigration to Sweden was considerable during the 1950s and 1960s. In 2015, 156 045 people in Sweden (or 1.58% of the Swedish population) were Finnish immigrants. Not all of them, however, were Finnish speakers.

The national minority of Sweden Finns usually does not include immigrated Swedish-speaking Finns, and the national minority of Sweden Finns is protected by Swedish laws that grant specific rights to speakers of the Finnish language. English somewhat lacks the distinction between Finns in Sweden (), which emphases nationality rather than linguistic or ethnic belonging and thereby includes all Finnish heritage regardless of language, and Sweden Finns () which emphases linguistic and ethnic belonging rather than nationality and usually excludes Swedish-speaking Finns. Such distinctions are, however, blurred by the dynamics of migration, bilingualism, and national identities in the two countries. Speakers of Meänkieli are singled out as a separate linguistic minority by Swedish authorities.

==History==
Communities of Finns in Sweden can be traced back to the Reformation when the Finnish Church in Stockholm was founded in 1533, although earlier migration, and migration to other cities in present-day Sweden, remain undisputed. (Strictly speaking this was not a case of emigration/immigration but of &quot;internal migration&quot; within pre-1809 Sweden.)

In the 16th and the 17th century large groups of Savonians moved from Finland to Dalecarlia, Bergslagen and other provinces where their slash and burn cultivation was suitable. This was part of an effort of the Swedish king Gustav Vasa, and his successors, to expand agriculture to these uninhabited parts of the country which were later on known as finnskogar (&quot;Forests of the Finns&quot;).

In the 1600s, there were plans to set up a new region Järle län that would have contained most of the Forest Finns. In Sweden at this time, all legislation and official journals were also published in Finnish. Bank-notes were issued in Swedish and Finnish etc. After 1809, and the loss of the eastern part of Sweden (Finland) to Russia, the Swedish church planned a Finnish-speaking bishopric with Filipstad as seat. However, after the mid-1800s cultural imperialism and nationalism led to new policies of assimilation and Swedification of the Finnish-speaking population. These efforts peaked from the end of the 1800s and until the 1950s. Finnish speakers remain only along the border with Finland in the far North, and as domestic migrants due to unemployment in the North. Depending on definition they are reported to number to 30,000–90,000 — that is up to 1% of Sweden&#x27;s population, but the proportion of active Finnish-speakers among them has declined drastically in the last generations, and Finnish is hardly spoken among the youngsters today. Since the 1970s largely unsuccessful efforts have been made to reverse some of the effects of Swedification, notably education and public broadcasts in Finnish, to raise the status of Finnish. As a result, a written standard of the local dialect Meänkieli has been established and taught, which has given reason to critical remarks from Finland, along the line that standard Finnish would be of more use for the students.

==Distribution of Sweden Finns==
The city of Eskilstuna, Södermanland, is one of the most heavily populated Sweden Finnish cities of Sweden, due to migration from Finland, during the 1950s until the 1970s, due to Eskilstuna&#x27;s large number of industries. In Eskilstuna, the Finnish-speaking minority have both a private school (the only one in the city of Eskilstuna, there is no public school or teachers in Finnish at the public schools. Only the lower level is in Finnish, upper level is in Swedish) and only one magazine in Finnish. Some of the municipal administration is also available in Finnish.

In the Finnish mindset, the term &quot;Sweden Finns&quot; &quot;(ruotsinsuomalaiset)&quot; is first and foremost directed at these immigrants and their offspring, who at the end of the 20th century numbered almost 200,000 first-generation immigrants, and about 250,000 second-generation immigrants. Of these some 200,000–250,000 are estimated to be able to speak Finnish, and 100,000 remain citizens of Finland. This usage is not quite embraced in Sweden. According to the latest research by SR&#x27;s Finnish language channel &quot;Sveriges Radio Finska&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Sisuradio&quot;), there are almost 470,000 people who speak or understand Finnish or &quot;Meänkieli&quot;, which was about 4.5% of the population of Sweden in 2019.

In the Swedish mindset, the term &quot;Sweden Finns&quot; historically denominated primarily the (previously) un-assimilated indigenous minority of ethnic Finns who ended up on the Swedish side of the border when Sweden was partitioned in 1809, after the Finnish War, and the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland was created. These Finnish-speakers are chiefly categorized as either Tornedalians originating at the Finnish–Swedish border in the far north, or &quot;Forest Finns&quot; (skogsfinnar) along the Norwegian–Swedish border in Central Sweden.

== Today ==
Today Finnish is an official minority language of Sweden. The benefits of being a &quot;minority language&quot; are however limited to Finnish-speakers being able to use Finnish for some communication with local and regional authorities in a small number of communities &quot;(Borås, Borlänge, Botkyrka, Degerfors, Enköping, Eskilstuna, Fagersta, Finspång, Gällivare, Gävle, Göteborg, Gislaved, Hällefors, Håbo, Hallstahammar, Haninge, Haparanda, Hofors, Huddinge, Järfälla, Köping, Kalix, Karlskoga, Kiruna, Lindesberg, Ludvika, Luleå, Malmö, Mariestad, Motala, Norrköping, Nykvarn, Olofström, Oxelösund, Pajala, Söderhamn, Södertälje, Sandviken, Sigtuna, Skövde, Skellefteå, Skinnskatteberg, Smedjebacken, Solna, Stockholm, Sundbyberg, Sundsvall, Surahammar, Tierp, Trelleborg, Trollhättan, Trosa, Uddevalla, Umeå, Upplands-Väsby, Uppsala, Västerås, Norrtälje, Upplands-Bro, Älvkarleby, Örebro, Örnsköldsvik, Österåker, Östhammar, Övertorneå)&quot; where Finnish immigrants make up a considerable share of the population, but not in the rest of Sweden.

<doc id="207860" wikidata="Q229867" url="?curid=207860" title="Elisabeth Farnese">
<text>Elisabeth Farnese (Italian: &quot;Elisabetta Farnese&quot;, Spanish: &quot;Isabel de Farnesio&quot;; 25 October 169211 July 1766) was Queen of Spain by marriage to King Philip V. She was the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Spain from 1714 until 1746, since she managed the affairs of state with the approval of her spouse. She is particularly known for her great influence over Spain&#x27;s foreign policy. From 1759 to 1760, she governed as regent.

==Parma==
Elisabeth was born at the Palazzo della Pilotta in Parma, the daughter of Odoardo Farnese and Dorothea Sophie of Neuburg. Her mother later married her uncle Francesco Farnese, Duke of Parma.

Elisabeth was raised in seclusion in an apartment in the Palace in Parma. She had a difficult relationship with her mother, but was reportedly deeply devoted to her uncle-stepfather. She could speak and write Latin, French, and German and was schooled in rhetoric, philosophy, geography and history, but, reportedly, she found no interest in her studies and lacked intellectual interests. She was a better student within dance, studied painting under Pietro Antonio Avanzini and enjoyed music and embroidery. She survived a virulent attack of smallpox.

Because of the lack of male heirs of her father, her uncle-stepfather, and her youngest uncle, who all succeeded one another, preparations were made for the succession of the Duchy of Parma through the female line (her). She consequently received many marriage proposals. Victor Amadeus, Prince of Piedmont and Francesco d&#x27;Este, Hereditary Prince of Modena both asked for her hand but negotiations eventually failed, as well as Prince Pico della Mirandola. The Duchy of Parma would later be inherited by her first son, Infante Carlos. After his accession to the Spanish throne, the title passed on to her third son, Infante Felipe. It was he who founded the modern day House of Bourbon-Parma.

==Marriage==
On 16 September 1714 she was married by proxy at Parma to Philip V of Spain. The marriage was arranged by the ambassador of Parma, Cardinal Alberoni, with the concurrence of the Princesse des Ursins, the &quot;Camarera mayor de Palacio&quot; of the King of Spain. Elisabeth was a natural choice for Philip V because of the traditional Spanish interests in Italian provinces, and she was the heir of the Parmesan throne. 

The Parmese ambassador convinced the all-powerful Princess des Ursins to give her crucial consent to the marriage by convincing her that Elisabeth was a simple-minded person, accustomed to nothing but needlework and embroidery and easy to control and dominate as a replacement for the previous, cooperative queen consort. In parallel, Alberoni informed Elisabeth that the king &quot;wishes to be governed&quot; by others and that she would be an unhappy queen unless she swiftly took control, and that she would also be liked by the Spaniards if she removed the influence of the French party headed by the Princess des Ursins.

Elisabeth left Parma in September and traveled to Spain by land in a retinue led by Marquis Schotta and Ippolita Ludovisi, Princess of Piombino. Originally intended to travel by sea, she became ill in Genoa, and the plans were therefore altered. On her way to Spain, she met the Prince of Monaco and the French ambassador, who forwarded her gifts from the King of France. Elisabeth spent several days in Bayonne in November as guest of her maternal aunt, the Queen Dowager Maria Anna of Spain. At the Franco-Spanish border, she was met by Alberoni, who spent several days warning her against des Ursins. Upon entrance to Spain, she refused to part with her Italian retinue in exchange for a Spanish one, as had originally been planned.

On 23 December at Jadraque, Elisabeth met the Princesse des Ursins, who as her newly appointed Mistress of the Robes wished to present herself before Elisabeth met Philip V at Guadalajara. The princess had sent out spies who reported that Elisabeth was in fact not at all a timid person who would be easy to control. Elisabeth received des Ursins and asked to speak with her privately. Shortly after, the party could hear the sounds of a violent argument, after which des Ursins was arrested, fired, and immediately escorted over the border to France. There have been many different versions of this incident, and different suggestions as to how it occurred. Alberoni informed the king that Elisabeth had acted with his best interests at hand, and when Philip met Elisabeth at Guadalajara 24 December, he quickly fell in love with her at first sight, just as he had with his former spouse.

==Queen of Spain==

Elisabeth enjoyed hunting and wore male riding attire while doing so. She was described as an excellent shot and rider, and often hunted with the king. She spent extravagantly, on both herself and her confidants. Her circle of confidants consisted, except her nurse Laura Pescatori, of her Italian doctor Cervi and Marquis Scotti, who were also a part of her Italian retinue. Her favorites among her ladies-in-waiting was first her Flemish attendant La Pellegrina, who acted as the go-between for her and minister Patino, and the Duchess of Saint-Pierre; after the former had married and the latter departed for France in 1727, she favored the Marchioness Las Nieves, who had the task to act as the queen&#x27;s informant and who by 1736 was said to be the one who should be courted for supplicants to the queen. She respected her chief lady-in-waiting, Countess de Altamira, who managed her ladies-in-waiting very strictly.

The queen collected Italian works from the 16th and 17th centuries, including masterpieces by Correggio, Guido Reni, Francesco Salviati and Flemish works by such celebrated artists as Anthony van Dyck, and the Bruegel family.

Initially, Queen Elisabeth was popular because her dismissal of des Ursins made her seem as the savior of Spain from French dominance, but her complete dominance of the monarch soon made her as unpopular as des Ursins. Elisabeth was also unpopular among the Spanish nobility for the decline of formal Spanish etiquette court life, and pamphlets of the &quot;Spanish party&quot; typically accused her of keeping the king in slavery, benefiting foreigners and trying to murder her step-sons.

===Political influence===
With the advice of Alberoni and Cardinal del Giudice, Elisabeth became the confidante of Philip and proceeded to eliminate the French party at court. They were replaced with her own followers through a network of clients and supporters, created with the help of her Italian nurse Laura Pescatori. Her chief adviser was Alberoni, who guided her as to how to protect the interests of herself and Parma, while he himself, as a foreigner, had only her to rely on for his power.

Queen Elisabeth quickly obtained complete influence over Philip. Reportedly she had charm and purposefulness, she was intelligent and could converse, be happy, jovial and charming. But she was also ambitious for glory, approval and popularity. According to the French ambassador the Duke of Saint-Aignan, she got the king to believe that what she willed was what he wanted, and she shared his tastes and eccentricities. Also, depressive episodes often left Philip V paralyzed and unable to handle government affairs, during which she handled them. Such periods occurred in 1717, 1722, 1728, 1731, 1732–33 and 1737. 
In contrast to what was customary for a Spanish monarch, Philip preferred to share the queen&#x27;s apartments rather than have his own separate ones, and it was in the queen&#x27;s apartments he met with his ministers. Elisabeth was therefore present at all government meetings from the start, and while she initially sat by the side embroidering, she soon participated more and more and eventually speaking for her spouse while he sat quiet. The king did not live in his own apartments but in the queen&#x27;s, where he spent the whole night. When he awoke, he discussed the government business with the queen, after which the couple, still in their dressing gowns, conferred with their ministers in the queen&#x27;s bedroom while the government business was spread over the queen&#x27;s bed by her ladies-in-waiting. From 1729, they seldom emerged from the queen&#x27;s quarters before two in the afternoon, after which they very swiftly performed their official functions. Philip did not like ceremonial court life and preferred to live in the smaller hunting palaces such as El Pardo or Aranjuez, where ceremonial court life could not properly occur. The royal couple&#x27;s absence from court life and lack of public visibility became so marked that they were criticized for it, especially Elisabeth. After the dismissal of Alberoni in 1719 she was effectively the sole ruler in Spain.

In 1724, entreaties failed to prevent the abdication of Philip, who gave up the throne in favour of his firstborn (Louis I), heir from his first marriage. Phillip then retired to the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso. Also in 1724, Elisabeth acquired the San Ildefonso Group for him from the Odescalchi family. During the reign of Louis Elisabeth kept her hold of power. Seven months later, however, the death of the young king recalled Philip to the throne. It was Elisabeth who, with the aide of the ministers, the papal nuncio, theologians and her network of contacts, pressured him to retake the crown.

===Foreign policy===
Queen Elisabeth was uninterested in domestic policy and preferred foreign policy, where her goal was to enforce the Spanish presence in the Italian states, combined with her ambition for her own sons, who were initially not expected to succeed in Spain because of her step-sons. Elisabeth&#x27;s influence was exerted altogether in support of Alberoni&#x27;s policy, one chief aim of which was to recover the ancient Italian possessions of Spain, and which actually resulted in the seizure of Sardinia and Sicily. So vigorously did she enter into this policy that when the French forces advanced to the Pyrenees, she placed herself at the head of one division of the Spanish army. In April 1719, the queen accompanied the king on his campaign to the front upon the French invasion; dressed in a habit of blue and silver, she continuously reviewed and encouraged her troops on horseback.

Her ambition, however, was grievously disappointed. The Triple Alliance thwarted her plans when British troops raided Vigo, and by 1720 the allies made the banishment of Alberoni a condition of peace. Sicily and Sardinia also had to be evacuated.

During the later years of Philip V, when he was nearly senile, Elisabeth directed the whole policy of Spain so as to secure thrones in Italy for her sons. In 1731 she had the satisfaction of seeing her favored scheme realized with the recognition by the powers in the Treaty of Vienna of her son Don Carlos (afterwards Charles III of Spain) as the Duke of Parma, and after the 1738 Treaty of Vienna his accession to the thrones of Naples and Sicily. Her second son, Philip, became Duke of Parma in 1748.

==Queen Dowager==
On 9 July 1746, the reign of Elisabeth ended with the death of Philip V and the succession of her stepson Ferdinand. As Ferdinand, like his father, left the government business to his spouse, Maria Barbara, the French ambassador remarked that: &quot;it is rather Barbara who succeeds Elisabeth than Ferdinand succeeding Philip.&quot;

As queen dowager, Elisabeth initially did not agree to surrender the reins of power. She settled with a court of supporters in a rented mansion in Madrid, and demanded to be kept informed of government policy and openly criticized the new monarchs. By mid 1747, Queen Barbara was encouraged to deal with her by Portugal and José de Carvajal y Lancáster, and on 23 July 1747, Elisabeth was exiled with her court to the palace of La Granja, where she spent the rest of her step-son&#x27;s reign exiled from the royal court and any influence on politics. She hosted grand receptions where she welcomed foreign diplomats and encouraged the criticism of the opposition toward her step-son.

The last time Elisabeth Farnese was involved in politics was after the death of her step-son Ferdinand VI in 1759. After his death, the Spanish throne went to her own son, then absent as the King of Naples. Elisabeth was then made interim regent of Spain from the death of Ferdinand VI in 1759 until the arrival of her son Charles III in 1760.

In the time between her husband&#x27;s death in 1746 and her own in 1766, she witnessed many events: the accession to the Spanish throne of her stepson, Ferdinand VI and Barbara of Portugal, whom she hated; and the accession to the throne of Parma of her beloved second son, Philip. In 1752 she built the Royal Palace of Riofrío as her dowager residence.

She later spent much of her time at the palaces of La Granja and Aranjuez. She was a patron of the Royal Glass Factory at La Granja. She died at Aranjuez in 1766 at the age of 73. She was buried next to her husband in the Colegiata of San Ildefonso. Her extensive art collection was divided among her three sons.

<text>Creature Comforts is a British stop-motion comedy franchise originating in a 1989 animated short film of the same name. The film matched animated zoo animals with a soundtrack of people talking about their homes, making it appear as if the animals were being interviewed about their living conditions. It was created by Nick Park and Aardman Animations. The film became the basis of a series of television advertisements for the electricity boards in the United Kingdom. In 2003, a television series in the same style was released. An American version of the series was also made. A sequel series, &quot;Things We Love&quot;, first aired on BBC One in 2024.

==The original film==
The original &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; (short film) was five minutes and a few seconds long and was conceived and directed by Nick Park and produced by Aardman Animations, featuring the voices of British non-actors in the same vein as the &quot;man on the street&quot; Vox Pop interviews. It was produced as part of a series called &quot;Lip Synch&quot; for Channel 4. The film won Nick Park the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1991.

The film shows various animals in a zoo being interviewed about their living conditions. These include a family of polar bears, Tracey, a depressed female gorilla, a Brazilian puma, a maternal brown four-eyed opossum, and a hippopotamus calf who complain about the cold weather, the poor quality of their enclosures and the lack of space and freedom.

By contrast, a tarsier, Alex, a former circus chicken, a tortoise, and an armadillo praise their enclosures for the comfort and security they bring, and a family of polar bears, particularly one named Andrew, talk about both the advantages and disadvantages of zoos for the welfare of animals. Rather than the subject being one-sided or biased towards one viewpoint, there is a strong balance of opinions in the film, with some interviewees who are happy with their living situation, some who are not, and some who have a neutral opinion.

The voices of each character were performed by residents of both a housing estate and an old people&#x27;s home. Stop motion animation was then used to animate each character, and the answers given in the interviews were put in the context of zoo animals. The polar bears were voiced by a family who owned a local shop, while the puma was voiced by Nick Park&#x27;s Brazilian friend. The only credited actress was Julie Sedgewick who voiced the interviewer.

==Advertisements==
In 1990, Nick Park worked with Phil Rylance and Paul Cardwell to develop a series of British television advertisements for the electricity boards&#x27; &quot;Heat Electric&quot; campaign. The creative team of advertising agency GGK had seen the original &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; film and were hugely impressed by it.

They were convinced that a series of short films modeled on the original film would be ideally suited to television advertising – as long as the advertising was handled with sufficient sensitivity to preserve the integrity and charm of Park&#x27;s work. The initial result of their collaboration was three thirty-seconds &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; advertisements, made in the same style as the original film. This led to a series.

Although there had been a tradition of &quot;vox pop&quot; advertisements going back to the soap powder adverts of the 1960s, the &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; series was distinctive in its juxtaposition of real-life dialogue and animated creatures. The series featured a variety of endearing plasticine animals, including a tortoise, a cat, a family of penguins and a Brazilian parrot. The characters were seen in their own domestic settings, chatting to an unseen interviewer behind a large microphone.

The characters&#x27; dialogue was obtained by taking tape recordings of everyday people talking about the comfort and benefits of the electrical appliances in their homes and then using extracts of these – complete with pauses, false starts, repetitions, hesitations and unscripted use of language (such as &quot;easily turn off and on able&quot;). The selected interviewees spoke in a range of down-to-earth regional accents, and the overall effect was of natural conversation. The adverts&#x27; warm and cosy tone reflected the warmth and homeliness of central heating.

There was a certain charm about the animations, with their quirky humour and sharpness of observation – such as in the antics of the non-speaking characters and in the odd little things happening in the background. The animations had an unusual expressiveness, with the wit often coming from tiny nuances – such as a dog scratching his ear at a particular moment.

The characterisation was strengthened by having each voice carefully matched to a suitable animal in a combination that would produce a memorable impact. These features were rounded off by a gentle closing voiceover spoken by Johnny Morris. Morris appealed especially to older audiences, who would remember him and his animal conversations on the television programme &quot;Animal Magic&quot;.

The campaign was a great success and its run was extended over three years. The advertisements received critical acclaim within the advertising industry – with Park, Rylance and Cardwell picking up many top creative awards in Europe and America, including &quot;Best Commercial of the Year&quot; in the 1991 British Television Advertising Awards and &quot;Most Outstanding European Campaign&quot; in the 1991 D&amp;AD Europe Awards. In fact, &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; was subsequently voted by media professionals (in leading trade outlets &quot;Marketing&quot; and &quot;Brand Republic&quot;) as one of the top television advertisements of the last fifty years.

As well as attaining a very high level of viewer recall, the advertisements were much loved – particularly the ones involving Frank (the tortoise), Carol (the cat) and Pablo (the parrot). In awarding them a place in &quot;The 100 best British ads of the century&quot;, the United Kingdom&#x27;s leading advertising journal &quot;Campaign&quot; commented &quot;The power of a campaign which can make consumers feel warm towards a utility cannot be underestimated&quot;.

The many popular awards won by the &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; advertisements included being voted fourth in the all time &quot;100 Greatest TV Ads&quot; by readers of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and viewers of Channel 4 in April 2000. Their position among the classic advertisements of British television was confirmed when &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; was voted fourth in &quot;ITV&#x27;s Best Ever Adverts&quot; by viewers of ITV in 2005. Finally, in a YouGov survey during 2006, &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; topped the list of the United Kingdom&#x27;s alltime favourite animated or puppet characters used in adverts.

The &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; advertisements have now attained a place in popular culture, and are probably better remembered than the original film that spawned them. However, it is claimed that many members of the public mistakenly remember the commercials as advertising gas heating, the main competitor to electricity.

===Influences===
The &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; advertisements were produced in the period 1990 to 1992 and in some ways they were indicative of the shape of things to come in British television advertising. Many commentators believe that there was a fundamental shift in television advertising from the unbridled consumerism and egoism of the 1980s to what is sometimes termed a more &quot;caring&quot; approach in the 1990s. The &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; advertisements are cited as an early example of this phenomenon.

The format of the &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; advertisements was so successful that it was replicated in other campaigns in the following decades. In later years, however, members of the public became increasingly conscious of the potential uses of their &quot;vox pop&quot; interviews. This made it difficult to recapture the spontaneity and innocence of the early &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; advertisements. Although lookalike animations became relatively commonplace in television advertisements, they were usually scripted and rarely possessed the painstaking attention to detail of the original advertisements.

==The series==
In 2003, a series of &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; films directed by Richard Goleszowski was made for the British television network ITV by Aardman Animations. The series was distributed globally by Granada International who also handled home video rights except in the United Kingdom, United States and Australia, which were retained by Aardman.

The series has since aired as repeats on Comedy Central, usually late at night. Starting in 2005, it has also aired in Australia on ABC, in The Netherlands on Veronica, on pay television channel US TV, and on the Internet, as well as on the Aardman Animations YouTube Channel.

A thirty-minute special in which the regular characters attempt to perform and interpret the Christmas carol &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; was first aired on 25 December 2005. The special was broadcast in Canada on the CBC on 26 December 2005.

Humour pervades all aspects of the series, for example:
* A highly philosophical speech given by Brian the amoeba.
* An alligator praising her neighbourhood, the sewer.
* Animals being scared of their own habitat
* Background details such as:
** Insects swarming into a gap in the paving stones when a slug mimics a bird call.
** Grey aliens blinking in unison.
** A lab mouse being interviewed while another mouse with a human ear on his back walks by.

The series gently mocks the constructed &quot;performance&quot; sometimes given by members of the general public when being interviewed for television vox pops and documentaries. This includes the attempts to present a cogent but simple conclusive answer to a general question, a sound bite, and the attempts to present a cheery spin on a complex issue while the subject attempts to hide their personal issues and problems with the issue.

The series is currently repeated on Gold.

The series is also available on the streaming service ITVX.

==Regular characters==
The following characters are among those who make regular appearances throughout the series. These animals are always portrayed by the same interviewees to maintain consistency throughout the series.

* Sapphire – an adolescent bottlenose dolphin who lives in an aquarium.

==Miscellaneous==
A special short was aired in the United Kingdom as part of Red Nose Day 2007.

==American version==
Starting in June 2007, CBS planned to broadcast seven episodes of an Americanized version of the show, featuring ordinary American people providing the voices, in the same vein as the British original. The series was titled &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; and was seen Monday nights at 8PM ET/PT from 4 to 18 June 2007 (only three episodes were broadcast due to low ratings, and was replaced with reruns of &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot;); the series was also simulcast in Canada on the CH system. It was the first adult animated series produced for CBS since &quot;Where&#x27;s Huddles?&quot; and &quot;Fish Police&quot;.

CBS also created a web presence with the help of the &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; staff. A behind-the-scenes collaborative account/blog of each episode was posted, in conjunction with the three short-lived airings. The American version was co-produced by Aardman Animations and The Gotham Group.

Seven episodes of this series were produced. However, the series ran for only three episodes, before being cancelled by CBS due to low ratings. Its remaining episodes were later premiered on Animal Planet in 2008 (see below). A standard DVD of the show&#x27;s seven episodes was released on 9 October 2007 by Sony, now entitled &quot;Creature Comforts America&quot;. Currently, there is no Blu-ray version, even though the show was mastered in 1080 HD with a 16:9 aspect ratio.

On 8 February 2008, the show won an Annie Award for &quot;Best Animated Television Production&quot; of 2007. In Australia, public broadcaster ABC Television began airing the American season in Australia on 18 February 2008, having aired the original British version since its inception on both ABC1 and the digital only ABC2.

On 24 April 2008, Animal Planet picked up the first season of the American version. It was broadcast in both SD letterbox and native HD formats. Episodes 1&amp;2 premiered on 24 April, Episodes 3&amp;4 premiered on 1 May, and Episodes 5&amp;6 premiered on 9 May. &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; was nominated for an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour)&quot; but on 13 September 2008, it lost out to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Teresa Drilling, one of the show&#x27;s many animators, won an individual Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation&quot;.

===American version staff===
* Executive Producers: Kit Boss, Miles Bullough, Peter McHugh, David Sproxton, Peter Lord, Nick Park
* Producers: Kenny Micka, Gareth Owen
* Story Editors: Chad Carter, June Raphael, Casey Wilson
* Writers: Kit Boss, Chad Carter, Michael Dougan, Ben Stout, June Raphael, Casey Wilson
* Directors: David Osmand, Merlin Crossingham

==&quot;Things We Love&quot;==
In 2024, a sequel series, &quot;Things We Love&quot;, was announced by the BBC. Like the original series, audio from interviews with non-actors is synched with stop-motion animation of animals to make it seem as if they are talking about their living conditions. The sequel series is also created and produced by Aardman. The first three shorts aired on 8 March 2024 on BBC One.

==DVD releases==
The television series (United Kingdom) is now available to watch on the official Aardman YouTube channel. ()

<doc id="207870" wikidata="Q920953" url="?curid=207870" title="Lynden Pindling">
<text>Sir Lynden Oscar Pindling, KCMG, PC, NH, JP (22 March 193026 August 2000) was a Bahamian politician who is regarded by some as the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;, having led the Bahamas to majority rule and independence.

He served as the first black premier of the Colony of the Bahama Islands from 1967 to 1969 and as Prime Minister of the Bahamas from 1969 to 1992. 

He was leader of the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) from 1956 to 1997 when he resigned from public life under scandal. Pindling won an unbroken string of general elections until 1992, when the PLP lost to the Free National Movement (FNM) led by Hubert Alexander Ingraham. He conceded defeat with the words: &quot;the people of this great little democracy have spoken in a most dignified and eloquent manner and the voice of the people, is the voice of God&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Pindling was born on 22 March 1930 to Arnold and Viola (née Bain) Pindling in his grandfather&#x27;s home in Mason&#x27;s Addition, Nassau. 

Pindling&#x27;s father was a native of Jamaica who had immigrated to the Bahamas to join the Royal Bahamas Police Force as a constable. His father was also a shopkeeper, occasional farmer, raiser of racehorses and a businessman. Pindling&#x27;s mother hailed from the island of Acklins, which she left as a child. Sir Lynden Pindling was their only child.

As a young boy, Pindling worked for his father&#x27;s small grocery store which was attached to their home in East Street.He became chief delivery boy using the handlebars of his bike to make drop-offs in neighbouring areas. Earlier, this post had belonged to his then neighbour Sidney Poitier. 

== Education ==
Pindling&#x27;s parents wanted the best possible education available to him that they could afford, which led to Pindling transferring schools frequently in his earlier years.

He first attended Eastern Primary School, then located on School Lane between Shirley and Dowdeswell Street. He also spent some time at a Seventh-day Adventist primary school at his mother behest.

Between the ages seven and nine, Pindling attended all three of the government&#x27;s junior schools. He spent approximately one year each at Eastern Junior on Bay Street, Southern Junior on Wulff Road and Western Junior on the corner of Meeting Street and Hospital Lane. 

He then spent three years at Western Senior School from 1940 to 1943, where the head teacher was musician (and composer of the Bahamian National anthem), Timothy Gibson from whom Pindling also later took piano lessons. Pindling also participated in sports like track and field and softball.

In the summer of 1943, Pindling along with hundreds of children from all over The Bahamas took examinations for enrolment in the selective Government High School (GHS). He was one of twenty who won a place. He graduated from GHS in 1946.

Pindling went on to study at King&#x27;s College, University of London (1948–52), from which he received a law degree. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 12 October 1948 and was Called to the Bar on 10 February 1953.

==Political career==
=== Joining the PLP ===
By the end of 1953, Pindling had joined the newly-formed Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) as its legal advisor. 

=== Parliamentary leader of the party ===
In May 1956, Pindling got married. The following month, he successfully contested Nassau&#x27;s Southern District constituency in the 1956 general election. 

He became Parliamentary Leader of the party when PLP Chairman and de facto leader, Henry Taylor, was defeated in the 1956 general election. 

Pindling was elected the party&#x27;s Parliamentary Leader over the dynamic and popular labour leader Randol Fawkes. He was appointed as the first leader of the opposition in 1964.

He would go on to win successive elections to the House of Assembly in 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992 and 1997.

=== Black Tuesday ===
On 27 April 1965, a day known in Bahamian history as &quot;Black Tuesday&quot;, Pindling delivered a speech in the House of Assembly. 

In a dramatic turn of events, Pindling ended his speech by taking the Speaker&#x27;s Mace and, in a dramatic power-to-the-people gesture, throwing the mace out of a window onto the street, which temporarily halted proceedings.

=== Prime minister ===
Pindling was elected in 1967 on a platform that included hostility to gambling, corruption and the Bay Street Boys&#x27; mob connections. 

On 10 January 1967, the PLP and the governing United Bahamian Party (led by Sir Roland Symonette) each won 18 seats in the Assembly. Randol Fawkes, the lone Labour MP, and Alvin Braynen, lent their votes to PLP allowing Pindling to form the first black government in Bahamian history. 

Fawkes would be become Labour Minister and Braynen Speaker of the House of Assembly.

=== Independence ===
Pindling went on to lead the Bahamas to independence from Great Britain on 10 July 1973. 

=== Achievements ===
He introduced social security measures in the form of the National Insurance Scheme, and the formation of the College of The Bahamas and the Royal Bahamas Defence Force.

Pindling held the additional portfolio of Minister of Finance from 1984 to 1990.

== Controversy ==

=== Early corruption claims ===
In 1966–67, the British government sent a Royal Commission of Inquiry to Nassau to investigate charges of widespread corruption in the Bahamian political system. The four-man commission was headed by Sir Ranulph Bacon, who had recently retired as deputy commander of Scotland Yard. 

The commission reported that the United Bahamian Party, which had previously been in government, had been a front for mob-affiliated American casino interests, and that the former Premier, Sir Roland Symonette, and the influential Tourism Minister, Sir Stafford Sands, and some others, all received large payments from the casino and resort businesses they had permitted to operate. 

The commission also found, however, that Pindling, during his campaign, had been funded and aided by U.S. casino operator Michael McLaney in the expectation that Pindling would permit McLaney to operate in the islands. Because of the report, Pindling broke his link with McLaney but was not himself prosecuted. Certain prominent mob figures, including Dino Cellini, were exiled from Bahamas but casino operations continued. Pindling told the commission that U.S. interests had first approached him with evidence to implicate the UBP in corruption, which led to the royal commission.

In 1973, during a U.S. Senate subcommittee investigation of corrupt offshore finances, mob elements accused Mike McLaney and his associate Elliott Roosevelt of having offered a contract to kill Pindling for reneging on the deal. This plot was discredited, but new elements of the control of the Miami Beach-based, Meyer Lansky-led syndicate over Bahamian business and politics emerged, as well as details of McLaney&#x27;s dealings with Pindling, which included cash, aircraft, boats, and a campaign headquarters on Bay Street.

=== Later claims ===
In 1983, a report entitled &quot;The Bahamas: A Nation For Sale&quot; by investigative television journalist Brian Ross was aired on NBC in the United States. The report claimed Pindling and his government accepted bribes from Colombian drug smugglers, particularly the notorious Carlos Lehder, co-founder of the Medellín Cartel, in exchange for allowing the smugglers to use the Bahamas as a transshipment point to smuggle Colombian cocaine into the US. 

Through murder and extortion, Lehder had gained complete control over the Norman&#x27;s Cay in Exuma, which became the chief base for smuggling cocaine into the United States.

Lehder boasted to the Colombian media about his involvement in drug trafficking at Norman&#x27;s Cay and about giving hundreds of thousands of dollars in payoffs to the ruling Progressive Liberal Party, but Pindling vigorously denied the accusations, and made a testy appearance on NBC to rebut them.

==== Commission of Inquiry ====
The public outcry, however, led to the creation in 1983 of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking and Government Corruption in the Bahamas.

A review of Pindling&#x27;s personal finances by the Commission found that he had spent eight times his reported earnings from 1977 to 1984. According to the Inquiry, &quot;[t]he prime minister and Lady Pindling have received at least $57.3 million in cash. Explanations for some of these deposits were given... but could not be verified.&quot;

In 2018, a &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;It is an indication of the level of Pindling&#x27;s popularity in the Bahamas at the time that, despite the scandalous claims made against him in the US media, he never felt the need to resign or call an early election. Even with the commission&#x27;s report fresh in voters&#x27; minds, he led his party to another election victory in 1987.

=== Electoral defeat and retirement ===
However, in August 1992, the opposition Free National Movement bested the PLP in the general election.

After Pindling&#x27;s defeat, new prime minister Hubert Ingraham &quot;strongly rejected the idea that Sir Lynden or any member of his Government should be extradited to the United States to face possible charges.&quot;

The FNM would go on to win a second landslide victory in 1997, and Pindling retired from politics shortly afterward. He was succeeded as party leader by Perry Christie.

== Personal life ==
On 5 May 1956, Pindling married Marguerite McKenzie (later Lady Pindling and, in her own right, Dame Marguerite Pindling), of Long Bay Cays in Andros, at St Ann&#x27;s Parish on Fox Hill Road in Nassau.

The Pindlings were married from 1956 until Sir Lynden&#x27;s death in 2000. 

They had four children.

== Honours, awards, and recognition ==
Pindling was sworn in as a member of Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council (PC) in 1976, and he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (KCMG) in 1982. 

In 2018, he was posthumously awarded the Bahamian Order of National Hero (NH).

== Illness and death ==
In early 1996, Pindling began showing signs of tiredness and was diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer. He underwent a ten-week course of radiation treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital&#x27;s Oncology Center in Baltimore, and was given a clean bill of health, after which he returned to his post-Prime Minister work as lawyer.

In early July 2000, the cancer was found to have spread to his bones and Pindling was prescribed palliative care.

=== Death ===
Pindling died on Saturday, 26 August 2000 at his home on Skyline Drive, New Providence, surrounded by family. He was 70.

Following his death, 10 days of official mourning was declared nationwide. On 29 August, Parliament met, and then Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham and others paid public tribute. Two days later, all members of the Bahamas Bar did the same in a special session of the Supreme Court.

=== Lying in state and state funeral ===
Pindling&#x27;s body was displayed in the House of Assembly on Rawson Square, for public viewing for four days, beginning early in the morning on Thursday, 31 August.

On 4 September, a full state funeral was held at the Church of God of Prophecy in New Providence, led by a long procession, with the Royal Bahamas Police Force Band at its front and the Royal Bahamas Defence Force Band at its rear. 

His body was laid to rest at St Agnes Cemetery on Nassau Street in a mausoleum.

== Legacy ==

In 2006, Nassau International Airport was renamed Lynden Pindling International Airport in his honour.

He is also depicted on the current one dollar Bahamian bank note.

<doc id="207874" wikidata="Q14915018" url="?curid=207874" title="Swarm behaviour">
<text>Swarm behaviour, or swarming, is a collective behaviour exhibited by entities, particularly animals, of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps milling about the same spot or perhaps moving &quot;en masse&quot; or migrating in some direction. It is a highly interdisciplinary topic.

As a term, &quot;swarming&quot; is applied particularly to insects, but can also be applied to any other entity or animal that exhibits swarm behaviour. The term &quot;flocking&quot; or &quot;murmuration&quot; can refer specifically to swarm behaviour in birds, &quot;herding&quot; to refer to swarm behaviour in tetrapods, and &quot;shoaling&quot; or &quot;schooling&quot; to refer to swarm behaviour in fish. Phytoplankton also gather in huge swarms called &quot;blooms&quot;, although these organisms are algae and are not self-propelled the way animals are. By extension, the term &quot;swarm&quot; is applied also to inanimate entities which exhibit parallel behaviours, as in a robot swarm, an earthquake swarm, or a swarm of stars.

From a more abstract point of view, swarm behaviour is the collective motion of a large number of self-propelled entities. From the perspective of the mathematical modeller, it is an emergent behaviour arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination. Swarm behaviour is also studied by active matter physicists as a phenomenon which is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, and as such requires the development of tools beyond those available from the statistical physics of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. In this regard, swarming has been compared to the mathematics of superfluids, specifically in the context of starling flocks (murmuration).

Swarm behaviour was first simulated on a computer in 1986 with the simulation program boids. This program simulates simple agents (boids) that are allowed to move according to a set of basic rules. The model was originally designed to mimic the flocking behaviour of birds, but it can be applied also to schooling fish and other swarming entities.

==Models==
In recent decades, scientists have turned to modeling swarm behaviour to gain a deeper understanding of the behaviour.

===Mathematical models===
Early studies of swarm behaviour employed mathematical models to simulate and understand the behaviour. The simplest mathematical models of animal swarms generally represent individual animals as following three rules:
* Move in the same direction as their neighbours
* Remain close to their neighbours
* Avoid collisions with their neighbours

The boids computer program, created by Craig Reynolds in 1986, simulates swarm behaviour following the above rules. Many subsequent and current models use variations on these rules, often implementing them by means of concentric &quot;zones&quot; around each animal. In the &quot;zone of repulsion&quot;, very close to the animal, the focal animal will seek to distance itself from its neighbours to avoid collision. Slightly further away, in the &quot;zone of alignment&quot;, the focal animal will seek to align its direction of motion with its neighbours. In the outermost &quot;zone of attraction&quot;, which extends as far away from the focal animal as it is able to sense, the focal animal will seek to move towards a neighbour.

The shape of these zones will necessarily be affected by the sensory capabilities of a given animal. For example, the visual field of a bird does not extend behind its body. Fish rely on both vision and on hydrodynamic perceptions relayed through their lateral lines, while Antarctic krill rely both on vision and hydrodynamic signals relayed through antennae.

However recent studies of starling flocks have shown that each bird modifies its position, relative to the six or seven animals directly surrounding it, no matter how close or how far away those animals are. Interactions between flocking starlings are thus based on a topological, rather than a metric, rule. It remains to be seen whether this applies to other animals. Another recent study, based on an analysis of high-speed camera footage of flocks above Rome and assuming minimal behavioural rules, has convincingly simulated a number of aspects of flock behaviour.

===Evolutionary models===
In order to gain insight into why animals evolve swarming behaviours, scientists have turned to evolutionary models that simulate populations of evolving animals. Typically these studies use a genetic algorithm to simulate evolution over many generations. These studies have investigated a number of hypotheses attempting to explain why animals evolve swarming behaviours, such as the selfish herd theory the predator confusion effect, the dilution effect, and the many eyes theory.

===Agents===


===Self-organization===

===Emergence===
The concept of emergence—that the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and are irrelevant at the lower levels–is often a basic principle behind self-organizing systems. An example of self-organization in biology leading to emergence in the natural world occurs in ant colonies. The queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do. Instead, each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scents from larvae, other ants, intruders, food and buildup of waste, and leaves behind a chemical trail, which, in turn, provides a stimulus to other ants. Here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety. Despite the lack of centralized decision making, ant colonies exhibit complex behaviours and have even been able to demonstrate the ability to solve geometric problems. For example, colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies.

===Stigmergy===
A further key concept in the field of swarm intelligence is stigmergy. Stigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination between agents or actions. The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity. Stigmergy is a form of self-organization. It produces complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without need for any planning, control, or even direct communication between the agents. As such it supports efficient collaboration between extremely simple agents, who lack any memory, intelligence or even awareness of each other.

===Swarm intelligence===
Swarm intelligence is the collective behaviour of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial. The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence. The expression was introduced by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of cellular robotic systems.

Swarm intelligence systems are typically made up of a population of simple agents such as boids interacting locally with one another and with their environment. The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the emergence of intelligent global behaviour, unknown to the individual agents.

Swarm intelligence research is multidisciplinary. It can be divided into natural swarm research studying biological systems and artificial swarm research studying human artefacts. There is also a scientific stream attempting to model the swarm systems themselves and understand their underlying mechanisms, and an engineering stream focused on applying the insights developed by the scientific stream to solve practical problems in other areas.

===Algorithms===
Swarm algorithms follow a Lagrangian approach or an Eulerian approach. The Eulerian approach views the swarm as a field, working with the density of the swarm and deriving mean field properties. It is a hydrodynamic approach, and can be useful for modelling the overall dynamics of large swarms. However, most models work with the Lagrangian approach, which is an agent-based model following the individual agents (points or particles) that make up the swarm. Individual particle models can follow information on heading and spacing that is lost in the Eulerian approach.

====Ant colony optimization====

Ant colony optimization is a widely used algorithm which was inspired by the behaviours of ants, and has been effective solving discrete optimization problems related to swarming. The algorithm was initially proposed by Marco Dorigo in 1992, and has since been diversified to solve a wider class of numerical problems. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site, a process akin to swarming in honeybees.
*Ants are behaviourally unsophisticated; collectively they perform complex tasks. Ants have highly developed sophisticated sign-based communication.
*Ants communicate using pheromones; trails are laid that can be followed by other ants.
*Routing problem ants drop different pheromones used to compute the &quot;shortest&quot; path from source to destination(s).

====Self-propelled particles====

The concept of self-propelled particles (SPP) was introduced in 1995 by Tamás Vicsek &quot;et al.&quot; as a special case of the boids model introduced in 1986 by Reynolds. An SPP swarm is modelled by a collection of particles that move with a constant speed and respond to random perturbations by adopting at each time increment the average direction of motion of the other particles in their local neighbourhood.

Simulations demonstrate that a suitable &quot;nearest neighbour rule&quot; eventually results in all the particles swarming together, or moving in the same direction. This emerges, even though there is no centralized coordination, and even though the neighbours for each particle constantly change over time. SPP models predict that swarming animals share certain properties at the group level, regardless of the type of animals in the swarm. Swarming systems give rise to emergent behaviours which occur at many different scales, some of which are both universal and robust. It has become a challenge in theoretical physics to find minimal statistical models that capture these behaviours.

====Particle swarm optimization====

Particle swarm optimization is another algorithm widely used to solve problems related to swarms. It was developed in 1995 by Kennedy and Eberhart and was first aimed at simulating the social behaviour and choreography of bird flocks and fish schools. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The system initially seeds a population with random solutions. It then searches in the problem space through successive generations using stochastic optimization to find the best solutions. The solutions it finds are called particles. Each particle stores its position as well as the best solution it has achieved so far. The particle swarm optimizer tracks the best local value obtained so far by any particle in the local neighbourhood. The remaining particles then move through the problem space following the lead of the optimum particles. At each time iteration, the particle swarm optimiser accelerates each particle toward its optimum locations according to simple mathematical rules. Particle swarm optimization has been applied in many areas. It has few parameters to adjust, and a version that works well for a specific applications can also work well with minor modifications across a range of related applications. A book by Kennedy and Eberhart describes some philosophical aspects of particle swarm optimization applications and swarm intelligence. An extensive survey of applications is made by Poli.

====Altruism====
Researchers in Switzerland have developed an algorithm based on Hamilton&#x27;s rule of kin selection. The algorithm shows how altruism in a swarm of entities can, over time, evolve and result in more effective swarm behaviour.

==Biological swarming==
The earliest evidence of swarm behaviour in animals dates back about 480 million years. Fossils of the trilobite &quot;Ampyx priscus&quot; have been recently described as clustered in lines along the ocean floor. The animals were all mature adults, and were all facing the same direction as though they had formed a conga line or a peloton. It has been suggested they line up in this manner to migrate, much as spiny lobsters migrate in single-file queues; it has also been suggested that the formation is the precursor for mating, as with the fly &quot;Leptoconops torrens&quot;. The findings suggest animal collective behaviour has very early evolutionary origins.

Examples of biological swarming are found in bird flocks, fish schools, insect swarms, bacteria swarms, molds, molecular motors, quadruped herds and people.

===Social insects===
The behaviour of social insects (insects that live in colonies, such as ants, bees, wasps and termites) has always been a source of fascination for children, naturalists and artists. Individual insects seem to do their own thing without any central control, yet the colony as a whole behaves in a highly coordinated manner. Researchers have found that cooperation at the colony level is largely self-organized. The group coordination that emerges is often just a consequence of the way individuals in the colony interact. These interactions can be remarkably simple, such as one ant merely following the trail left by another ant. Yet put together, the cumulative effect of such behaviours can solve highly complex problems, such as locating the shortest route in a network of possible paths to a food source. The organised behaviour that emerges in this way is sometimes called swarm intelligence, a form of biological emergence.

====Ants====

Individual ants do not exhibit complex behaviours, yet a colony of ants collectively achieves complex tasks such as constructing nests, taking care of their young, building bridges and foraging for food. A colony of ants can collectively select (i.e. send most workers towards) the best, or closest, food source from several in the vicinity. Such collective decisions are achieved using positive feedback mechanisms. Selection of the best food source is achieved by ants following two simple rules. First, ants which find food return to the nest depositing a pheromone chemical. More pheromone is laid for higher quality food sources. Thus, if two equidistant food sources of different qualities are found simultaneously, the pheromone trail to the better one will be stronger. Ants in the nest follow another simple rule, to favor stronger trails, on average. More ants then follow the stronger trail, so more ants arrive at the high quality food source, and a positive feedback cycle ensures, resulting in a collective decision for the best food source. If there are two paths from the ant nest to a food source, then the colony usually selects the shorter path. This is because the ants that first return to the nest from the food source are more likely to be those that took the shorter path. More ants then retrace the shorter path, reinforcing the pheromone trail.

Army ants, unlike most ant species, do not construct permanent nests; an army ant colony moves almost incessantly over the time it exists, remaining in an essentially perpetual state of swarming. Several lineages have independently evolved the same basic behavioural and ecological syndrome, often referred to as &quot;legionary behaviour&quot;, and may be an example of convergent evolution.

The successful techniques used by ant colonies have been studied in computer science and robotics to produce distributed and fault-tolerant systems for solving problems. This area of biomimetics has led to studies of ant locomotion, search engines that make use of &quot;foraging trails&quot;, fault-tolerant storage and networking algorithms.

====Honey bees====

In temperate climates, honey bees usually form swarms in late spring. A swarm typically contains about half the workers together with the old queen, while the new queen stays back with the remaining workers in the original hive. When honey bees emerge from a hive to form a swarm, they may gather on a branch of a tree or on a bush only a few meters from the hive. The bees cluster about the queen and send out 20–50 scouts to find suitable new nest locations. The scouts are the most experienced foragers in the cluster. If a scout finds a suitable location, she returns to the cluster and promotes it by dancing a version of the waggle dance. This dance conveys information about the quality, direction, and distance of the new site. The more excited she is about her findings, the more vigorously she dances. If she can convince others they may take off and check the site she found. If they approve they may promote it as well. In this decision-making process, scouts check several sites, often abandoning their own original site to promote the superior site of another scout. Several different sites may be promoted by different scouts at first. After some hours and sometimes days, a preferred location eventually emerges from this decision-making process. When all scouts agree on the final location, the whole cluster takes off and swarms to it. Sometimes, if no decision is reached, the swarm will separate, some bees going in one direction; others, going in another. This usually results in failure, with both groups dying. A new location is typically a kilometre or more from the original hive, though some species, e.g., &quot;Apis dorsata&quot;, may establish new colonies within as little as 500 meters from the natal nest. This collective decision-making process is remarkably successful in identifying the most suitable new nest site and keeping the swarm intact. A good hive site has to be large enough to accommodate the swarm (about 15 litres in volume), has to be well-protected from the elements, receive an optimal amount of sunshine, be some height above the ground, have a small entrance and be capable of resisting ant infestation - that is why tree cavities are often selected.

===Non-social insects===

Unlike social insects, swarms of non-social insects that have been studied primarily seem to function in contexts such as mating, feeding, predator avoidance, and migration.

====Moths====
Moths may exhibit synchronized mating, during which pheromones released by females initiate searching and swarming behavior in males. Males sense pheromones with sensitive antennae and may track females as far as several kilometers away. Swarm mating involves female choice and male competition. Only one male in the swarm—typically the first—will successfully copulate. Females maximize fitness benefits and minimize cost by governing the onset and magnitude of pheromone deployed. Too little pheromone will not attract a mate, too much allows less fit males to sense the signal. After copulation, females lay the eggs on a host plant. Quality of host plant may be a factor influencing the location of swarming and egg-laying. In one case, researchers observed pink-striped oakworm moths (&quot;Anisota virginiensis&quot;) swarming at a carrion site, where decomposition likely increased soil nutrient levels and host plant quality.

====Flies====
Midges, such as &quot;Tokunagayusurika akamusi,&quot; form swarms, dancing in the air. Swarming serves multiple purposes, including the facilitation of mating by attracting females to approach the swarm, a phenomenon known as lek mating. Such cloud-like swarms often form in early evening when the sun is getting low, at the tip of a bush, on a hilltop, over a pool of water, or even sometimes above a person. The forming of such swarms is not out of instinct, but an adaptive behavior – a &quot;consensus&quot; – between the individuals within the swarms. It is also suggested that swarming is a ritual, because there is rarely any male midge by itself and not in a swarm. This could have formed due to the benefit of lowering inbreeding by having males of various genes gathering in one spot. The genus &quot;Culicoides&quot;, also known as biting midges, have displayed swarming behavior which are believed to cause confusion in predators.

====Cockroaches====
Cockroaches leave chemical trails in their feces as well as emitting airborne pheromones for mating. Other cockroaches will follow these trails to discover sources of food and water, and also discover where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, groups of cockroaches can exhibit emergent behaviour, in which group or swarm behaviour emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.

Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and will run away when exposed to light. A study tested the hypothesis that cockroaches use just two pieces of information to decide where to go under those conditions: how dark it is and how many other cockroaches there are. The study conducted by José Halloy and colleagues at the Free University of Brussels and other European institutions created a set of tiny robots that appear to the roaches as other roaches and can thus alter the roaches&#x27; perception of critical mass. The robots were also specially scented so that they would be accepted by the real roaches.

====Locusts====

Locusts are the swarming phase of the short-horned grasshoppers of the family Acrididae. Some species can breed rapidly under suitable conditions and subsequently become gregarious and migratory. They form bands as nymphs and swarms as adults—both of which can travel great distances, rapidly stripping fields and greatly damaging crops. The largest swarms can cover hundreds of square miles and contain billions of locusts. A locust can eat its own weight (about 2 grams) in plants every day. That means one million locusts can eat more than one tonne of food each day, and the largest swarms can consume over 100,000 tonnes each day.

Swarming in locusts has been found to be associated with increased levels of serotonin which causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, become mutually attracted, and breed much more easily. Researchers propose that swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding and studies have shown that increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs or, in some species, simply encountering other individuals causes an increase in levels of serotonin. The transformation of the locust to the swarming variety can be induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. Notably, an innate predisposition to aggregate has been found in hatchlings of the desert locust, &quot;Schistocerca gregaria&quot;, independent of their parental phase.

An individual locust&#x27;s response to a loss of alignment in the group appears to increase the randomness of its motion, until an aligned state is again achieved. This noise-induced alignment appears to be an intrinsic characteristic of collective coherent motion.

====Migratory behavior====

Insect migration is the seasonal movement of insects, particularly those by species of dragonflies, beetles, butterflies, and moths. The distance can vary from species to species, but in most cases these movements involve large numbers of individuals. In some cases the individuals that migrate in one direction may not return and the next generation may instead migrate in the opposite direction. This is a significant difference from bird migration.

Monarch butterflies are especially noted for their lengthy annual migration. In North America they make massive southward migrations starting in August until the first frost. A northward migration takes place in the spring. The monarch is the only butterfly that migrates both north and south as the birds do on a regular basis. But no single individual makes the entire round trip. Female monarchs deposit eggs for the next generation during these migrations. The length of these journeys exceeds the normal lifespan of most monarchs, which is less than two months for butterflies born in early summer. The last generation of the summer enters into a non-reproductive phase known as diapause and may live seven months or more. During diapause, butterflies fly to one of many overwintering sites. The generation that overwinters generally does not reproduce until it leaves the overwintering site sometime in February and March. It is the second, third and fourth generations that return to their northern locations in the United States and Canada in the spring. How the species manages to return to the same overwintering spots over a gap of several generations is still a subject of research; the flight patterns appear to be inherited, based on a combination of the position of the sun in the sky and a time-compensated Sun compass that depends upon a circadian clock that is based in their antennae.

===Birds===


====Bird migration====


Approximately 1800 of the world&#x27;s 10,000 bird species are long-distance migrants. The primary motivation for migration appears to be food; for example, some hummingbirds choose not to migrate if fed through the winter. Also, the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for breeding birds to feed their young. This helps diurnal birds to produce larger clutches than related non-migratory species that remain in the tropics. As the days shorten in autumn, the birds return to warmer regions where the available food supply varies little with the season. These advantages offset the high stress, physical exertion costs, and other risks of the migration such as predation.

Many birds migrate in flocks. For larger birds, it is assumed that flying in flocks reduces energy costs. The V formation is often supposed to boost the efficiency and range of flying birds, particularly over long migratory routes. All the birds except the first fly in the upwash from one of the wingtip vortices of the bird ahead. The upwash assists each bird in supporting its own weight in flight, in the same way a glider can climb or maintain height indefinitely in rising air. Geese flying in a V formation save energy by flying in the updraft of the wingtip vortex generated by the previous animal in the formation. Thus, the birds flying behind do not need to work as hard to achieve lift. Studies show that birds in a V formation place themselves roughly at the optimum distance predicted by simple aerodynamic theory. Geese in a V-formation may conserve 12–20% of the energy they would need to fly alone. Red knots and dunlins were found in radar studies to fly 5 km per hour faster in flocks than when they were flying alone. The birds flying at the tips and at the front are rotated in a timely cyclical fashion to spread flight fatigue equally among the flock members. The formation also makes communication easier and allows the birds to maintain visual contact with each other.


Other animals may use similar drafting techniques when migrating. Lobsters, for example, migrate in close single-file formation &quot;lobster trains&quot;, sometimes for hundreds of miles.

The Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large raptors and storks pass through areas such as Gibraltar, Falsterbo, and the Bosphorus at migration times. More common species, such as the European honey buzzard, can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the Central American migratory bottleneck. This concentration of birds during migration can put species at risk. Some spectacular migrants have already gone extinct, the most notable being the passenger pigeon. During migration the flocks were a mile (1.6 km) wide and 300 miles (500 km) long, taking several days to pass and containing up to a billion birds.
===Marine life===

====Fish====


The term &quot;shoal&quot; can be used to describe any group of fish, including mixed-species groups, while &quot;school&quot; is used for more closely knit groups of the same species swimming in a highly synchronised and polarised manner.

Fish derive many benefits from shoaling behaviour including defence against predators (through better predator detection and by diluting the chance of capture), enhanced foraging success, and higher success in finding a mate. It is also likely that fish benefit from shoal membership through increased hydrodynamic efficiency.

Fish use many traits to choose shoalmates. Generally they prefer larger shoals, shoalmates of their own species, shoalmates similar in size and appearance to themselves, healthy fish, and kin (when recognised). The &quot;oddity effect&quot; posits that any shoal member that stands out in appearance will be preferentially targeted by predators. This may explain why fish prefer to shoal with individuals that resemble them. The oddity effect would thus tend to homogenise shoals.

One puzzling aspect of shoal selection is how a fish can choose to join a shoal of animals similar to themselves, given that it cannot know its own appearance. Experiments with zebrafish have shown that shoal preference is a learned ability, not innate. A zebrafish tends to associate with shoals that resemble shoals in which it was reared, a form of imprinting.

Other open questions of shoaling behaviour include identifying which individuals are responsible for the direction of shoal movement. In the case of migratory movement, most members of a shoal seem to know where they are going. In the case of foraging behaviour, captive shoals of golden shiner (a kind of minnow) are led by a small number of experienced individuals who knew when and where food was available.

Radakov estimated herring schools in the North Atlantic can occupy up to with fish densities between 0.5 and 1.0 fish/cubic metre, totalling several billion fish in one school.

====Fish migration====


Between May and July huge numbers of sardines spawn in the cool waters of the Agulhas Bank and then follow a current of cold water northward along the east coast of South Africa. This great migration, called the sardine run, creates spectacular feeding frenzies along the coastline as marine predators, such as dolphins, sharks and gannets attack the schools.

====Krill====

Most krill, small shrimp-like crustaceans, form large swarms, sometimes reaching densities of 10,000–60,000 individual animals per cubic metre. Swarming is a defensive mechanism, confusing smaller predators that would like to pick out single individuals. The largest swarms are visible from space and can be tracked by satellite. One swarm was observed to cover an area of 450 square kilometres (175 square miles) of ocean, to a depth of 200 meters (650 feet) and was estimated to contain over 2 million tons of krill. Recent research suggests that krill do not simply drift passively in these currents but actually modify them. Krill typically follow a diurnal vertical migration. By moving vertically through the ocean on a 12-hour cycle, the swarms play a major part in mixing deeper, nutrient-rich water with nutrient-poor water at the surface. Until recently it has been assumed that they spend the day at greater depths and rise during the night toward the surface. It has been found that the deeper they go, the more they reduce their activity, apparently to reduce encounters with predators and to conserve energy.

Later work suggested that swimming activity in krill varied with stomach fullness. Satiated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefore sink below the mixed layer. As they sink they produce faeces which may mean that they have an important role to play in the Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs were found to swim more actively and thus head towards the surface. This implies that vertical migration may be a bi- or tri-daily occurrence. Some species form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because it makes them extremely vulnerable to predators. Dense swarms may elicit a feeding frenzy among fish, birds and mammal predators, especially near the surface. When disturbed, a swarm scatters, and some individuals have even been observed to moult instantaneously, leaving the exuvia behind as a decoy. In 2012, Gandomi and Alavi presented what appears to be a successful stochastic algorithm for modelling the behaviour of krill swarms. The algorithm is based on three main factors: &quot; (i) movement induced by the presence of other individuals (ii) foraging activity, and (iii) random diffusion.&quot;

====Copepods====

Copepods are a group of tiny crustaceans found in the sea and lakes. Many species are planktonic (drifting in sea waters), and others are benthic (living on the ocean floor). Copepods are typically long, with a teardrop shaped body and large antennae. Although like other crustaceans they have an armoured exoskeleton, they are so small that in most species this thin armour, and the entire body, is almost totally transparent. Copepods have a compound, median single eye, usually bright red, in the centre of the transparent head.

Copepods also swarm. For example, monospecific swarms have been observed regularly around coral reefs and sea grass, and in lakes. Swarms densities were about one million copepods per cubic metre. Typical swarms were one or two metres in diameter, but some exceeded 30 cubic metres. Copepods need visual contact to keep together, and they disperse at night.

Spring produces blooms of swarming phytoplankton which provide food for copepods. Planktonic copepods are usually the dominant members of the zooplankton, and are in turn major food organisms for many other marine animals. In particular, copepods are prey to forage fish and jellyfish, both of which can assemble in vast, million-strong swarms. Some copepods have extremely fast escape responses when a predator is sensed and can jump with high speed over a few millimetres (see animated image below).

Planktonic copepods are important to the carbon cycle. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on earth. They compete for this title with Antarctic krill. Because of their smaller size and relatively faster growth rates, however, and because they are more evenly distributed throughout more of the world&#x27;s oceans, copepods almost certainly contribute far more to the secondary productivity of the world&#x27;s oceans, and to the global ocean carbon sink than krill, and perhaps more than all other groups of organisms together. The surface layers of the oceans are currently believed to be the world&#x27;s largest carbon sink, absorbing about 2 billion tonnes of carbon a year, the equivalent to perhaps a third of human carbon emissions, thus reducing their impact. Many planktonic copepods feed near the surface at night, then sink into deeper water during the day to avoid visual predators. Their moulted exoskeletons, faecal pellets and respiration at depth all bring carbon to the deep sea.

====Algal blooms====
Many single-celled organisms called phytoplankton live in oceans and lakes. When certain conditions are present, such as high nutrient or light levels, these organisms reproduce explosively. The resulting dense swarm of phytoplankton is called an algal bloom. Blooms can cover hundreds of square kilometres and are easily seen in satellite images. Individual phytoplankton rarely live more than a few days, but blooms can last weeks.

===Plants===
Scientists have attributed swarm behavior to plants for hundreds of years. In his 1800 book, &quot;Phytologia: or, The philosophy of agriculture and gardening&quot;, Erasmus Darwin wrote that plant growth resembled swarms observed elsewhere in nature. While he was referring to more broad observations of plant morphology, and was focused on both root and shoot behavior, recent research has supported this claim.

Plant roots, in particular, display observable swarm behavior, growing in patterns that exceed the statistical threshold for random probability, and indicate the presence of communication between individual root apexes. The primary function of plant roots is the uptake of soil nutrients, and it is this purpose which drives swarm behavior. Plants growing in close proximity have adapted their growth to assure optimal nutrient availability. This is accomplished by growing in a direction that optimizes the distance between nearby roots, thereby increasing their chance of exploiting untapped nutrient reserves. The action of this behavior takes two forms: maximization of distance from, and repulsion by, neighboring root apexes. The transition zone of a root tip is largely responsible for monitoring for the presence of soil-borne hormones, signaling responsive growth patterns as appropriate. Plant responses are often complex, integrating multiple inputs to inform an autonomous response. Additional inputs that inform swarm growth includes light and gravity, both of which are also monitored in the transition zone of a root&#x27;s apex. These forces act to inform any number of growing &quot;main&quot; roots, which exhibit their own independent releases of inhibitory chemicals to establish appropriate spacing, thereby contributing to a swarm behavior pattern. Horizontal growth of roots, whether in response to high mineral content in soil or due to stolon growth, produces branched growth that establish to also form their own, independent root swarms.

===Bacteria===

Swarming also describes groupings of some kinds of predatory bacteria such as myxobacteria. Myxobacteria swarm together in &quot;wolf packs&quot;, actively moving using a process known as bacterial gliding and keeping together with the help of intercellular molecular signals.

===Mammals===



==People==


A collection of people can also exhibit swarm behaviour, such as pedestrians or soldiers swarming the parapets. In Cologne, Germany, two biologists from the University of Leeds demonstrated flock like behaviour in humans. The group of people exhibited similar behavioural pattern to a flock, where if five percent of the flock changed direction the others would follow. If one person was designated as a predator and everyone else was to avoid him, the flock behaved very much like a school of fish. Understanding how humans interact in crowds is important if crowd management is to effectively avoid casualties at football grounds, music concerts and subway stations.

The mathematical modelling of flocking behaviour is a common technology, and has found uses in animation. Flocking simulations have been used in many films to generate crowds which move realistically. Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was the first movie to make use of swarm technology for rendering, realistically depicting the movements of a group of bats using the boids system. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy made use of similar technology, known as Massive, during battle scenes. Swarm technology is particularly attractive because it is cheap, robust, and simple.

An ant-based computer simulation using only six interaction rules has also been used to evaluate aircraft boarding behaviour. Airlines have also used ant-based routing in assigning aircraft arrivals to airport gates. An airline system developed by Douglas A. Lawson uses swarm theory, or swarm intelligence—the idea that a colony of ants works better than one alone. Each pilot acts like an ant searching for the best airport gate. &quot;The pilot learns from his experience what&#x27;s the best for him, and it turns out that that&#x27;s the best solution for the airline,&quot; Lawson explains. As a result, the &quot;colony&quot; of pilots always go to gates they can arrive and depart quickly. The program can even alert a pilot of plane back-ups before they happen. &quot;We can anticipate that it&#x27;s going to happen, so we&#x27;ll have a gate available,&quot; says Lawson.

Swarm behaviour occurs also in traffic flow dynamics, such as the traffic wave. Bidirectional traffic can be observed in ant trails. In recent years this behaviour has been researched for insight into pedestrian and traffic models. Simulations based on pedestrian models have also been applied to crowds which stampede because of panic.

Herd behaviour in marketing has been used to explain the dependencies of customers&#x27; mutual behaviour. &quot;The Economist&quot; reported a recent conference in Rome on the subject of the simulation of adaptive human behaviour. It shared mechanisms to increase impulse buying and get people &quot;to buy more by playing on the herd instinct.&quot; The basic idea is that people will buy more of products that are seen to be popular, and several feedback mechanisms to get product popularity information to consumers are mentioned, including smart card technology and the use of Radio Frequency Identification Tag technology. A &quot;swarm-moves&quot; model was introduced by a Florida Institute of Technology researcher, which is appealing to supermarkets because it can &quot;increase sales without the need to give people discounts.&quot;

==Robotics==


The application of swarm principles to robots is called swarm robotics, while swarm intelligence refers to the more general set of algorithms.
Partially inspired by colonies of insects such as ants and bees, researchers are modelling the behaviour of swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task, such as finding something hidden, cleaning, or spying. Each robot is quite simple, but the emergent behaviour of the swarm is more complex. The whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system, in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism, exhibiting swarm intelligence. The largest swarms so far created is the 1024 robot Kilobot swarm. Other large swarms include the iRobot swarm, the SRI International/ActivMedia Robotics Centibots project, and the Open-source Micro-robotic Project swarm, which are being used to research collective behaviours. Swarms are also more resistant to failure. Whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission, a swarm can continue even if several robots fail. This could make them attractive for space exploration missions, where failure is normally extremely costly. In addition to ground vehicles, swarm robotics includes also research of swarms of aerial robots and heterogeneous teams of ground and aerial vehicles.

In contrast macroscopic robots, colloidal particles at microscale can also be adopted as agents to perform collective behaviors to conduct tasks using mechanical and physical approaches, such as reconfigurable tornado-like microswarm mimicking schooling fish, hierarchical particle species mimicking predating behavior of mammals, micro-object manipulation using a transformable microswarm. The fabrication of such colloidal particles is usually based on chemical synthesis.
==Military==

Military swarming is a behaviour where autonomous or partially autonomous units of action attack an enemy from several different directions and then regroup. &quot;Pulsing&quot;, where the units shift the point of attack, is also a part of military swarming. Military swarming involves the use of a decentralized force against an opponent, in a manner that emphasizes mobility, communication, unit autonomy and coordination or synchronization. Historically military forces used principles of swarming without really examining them explicitly, but now active research consciously examines military doctrines that draw ideas from swarming.

Merely because multiple units converge on a target, they are not necessarily swarming. Siege operations do not involve swarming, because there is no manoeuvre; there is convergence but on the besieged fortification. Nor do guerrilla ambushes constitute swarms, because they are &quot;hit-and-run&quot;. Even though the ambush may have several points of attack on the enemy, the guerillas withdraw when they either have inflicted adequate damage, or when they are endangered.

In 2014 the U. S. Office of Naval Research released a video showing tests of a swarm of small autonomous drone attack boats that can steer and take coordinated offensive action as a group.

==Myths==

* There is a popular myth that lemmings commit mass suicide by swarming off cliffs when they migrate. Driven by strong biological urges, some species of lemmings may migrate in large groups when population density becomes too great. Lemmings can swim and may choose to cross a body of water in search of a new habitat. In such cases, many may drown if the body of water is so wide as to stretch their physical capability to the limit. This fact combined with some unexplained fluctuations in the population of Norwegian lemmings gave rise to the myth.
* Piranha have a reputation as fearless fish that swarm in ferocious and predatory packs. However, recent research, which started &quot;with the premise that they school as a means of cooperative hunting&quot;, discovered that they were in fact rather fearful fish, like other fish, who schooled for protection from their predators, such as cormorants, caimans and dolphins. A researcher described them as &quot;basically like regular fish with large teeth&quot;.

<text>The Honourable Society of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, commonly known as Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, is one of the four Inns of Court (professional associations for barristers and judges) in London. To be called to the bar in order to practise as a barrister in England and Wales, an individual must belong to one of these inns. The other three are Middle Temple, Inner Temple, and Gray&#x27;s Inn.

Lincoln&#x27;s Inn is situated in Holborn, in the London Borough of Camden, just on the border with the City of London and the City of Westminster, and across the road from London School of Economics and Political Science, Royal Courts of Justice and King&#x27;s College London&#x27;s Maughan Library. The nearest tube station is Holborn tube station or Chancery Lane.

Lincoln&#x27;s Inn is the largest Inn, covering . It is believed to be named after Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln.

==History==
During the 12th and early 13th centuries, the law was taught in the City of London, primarily by the clergy. Two events ended this form of legal education: firstly, a papal bull in 1218 prohibited the clergy from teaching the common law, rather than canon law; and secondly, a decree by Henry III of England on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London. The secular lawyers migrated to the hamlet of Holborn, near to the law courts at Westminster Hall and outside the City.

As with the other Inns of Court, the precise date of founding of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn is unknown. The Inn can claim the oldest records – its &quot;black books&quot; documenting the minutes of the governing council go back to 1422, and the earliest entries show that the inn was at that point an organised and disciplined body. Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln had encouraged lawyers to move to Holborn, and they moved to Thavie&#x27;s Inn, one of the Inns of Chancery, later expanding into Furnival&#x27;s Inn as well. It is felt that Lincoln&#x27;s Inn became a formally organised inn of court soon after the earl&#x27;s death in 1310.

At some point before 1422, the greater part of &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Inn&quot;, as they had become known, after the Earl, moved to the estate of Ralph Neville, the Bishop of Chichester, near Chancery Lane. They retained Thavie&#x27;s and Furnival&#x27;s Inn, using them as &quot;training houses&quot; for young lawyers, and fully purchased the properties in 1550 and 1547 respectively. In 1537, the land Lincoln&#x27;s Inn sat on was sold by Bishop Richard Sampson to a Bencher named William Suliard, and his son sold the land to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1580. The Inn became formally organised as a place of legal education thanks to a decree in 1464, which required a Reader to give lectures to the law students there.

During the 15th century, the Inn was not a particularly prosperous one, and the Benchers, particularly John Fortescue, are credited with fixing this situation.

In 1920, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn added its first female member: Marjorie Powell.

==Structure and governance==

Lincoln&#x27;s Inn had no constitution or fundamental form of governance, and legislation was divided into two types; statutes, passed by the Governors (see below) and ordinances issued by the Society (all the Fellows of the Inn). A third method used was to have individual Fellows promise to fulfill a certain duty; the first known example is from 1435, and starts &quot;Here folowen certaynes covenantes and promyses made to the felloweshippe of Lyncoll&#x27; Yne&quot;. The increase of the size of the Inn led to a loss of its partially democratic nature, first in 1494 when it was decided that only Benchers and Governors should have a voice in calling people to the Bar and, by the end of the sixteenth century, Benchers were almost entirely in control.

Admissions were recorded in the black books and divided into two categories: Clerks (&quot;Clerici&quot;) who were admitted to Clerks&#x27; Commons; and Fellows (&quot;Socii&quot;) who were admitted to Fellows&#x27; Commons. All entrants swore the same oath regardless of category, and some Fellows were permitted to dine in Clerks&#x27; Commons as it cost less, making it difficult for academics to sometimes distinguish between the two – Walker, the editor of the Black Books, maintains that the two categories were one and the same. During the 15th century, the Fellows began to be called Masters, and the gap between Masters and Clerks gradually grew, with an order in 1505 that no Master was to be found in Clerks&#x27; Commons unless studying a point of law there. By 1466, the Fellows were divided into Benchers, those &quot;at the Bar&quot; (&quot;ad barram&quot;, also known as &quot;utter barristers&quot; or simply &quot;barristers&quot;), and those &quot;not at the Bar&quot; (&quot;extra barram&quot;). By 1502, the &quot;extra barram&quot; Fellows were being referred to as &quot;inner barristers&quot;, in contrast to the &quot;utter&quot; or &quot;outer&quot; barristers.

In Lord Mansfield&#x27;s time, there was no formal legal education, and the only requirement for a person to be called to the Bar was for him to have eaten five dinners a term at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and to have read the first sentence of a paper prepared for him by the steward.

===Benchers===

A Bencher, Benchsitter or (formally) Master of the Bench is a member of the Council, the governing body of the Honourable Society of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. The term originally referred to one who sat on the benches in the main hall of the Inn, which were used for dining and during moots, and the term originally had no significance. In Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, the idea of a Bencher was believed to have begun far earlier than elsewhere; there are records of four Benchers being sworn in 1440.

William Holdsworth and the editor of the Black Books both concluded that Benchers were, from the earliest times, the governors of the Inn, unlike other Inns who started with Readers. A. W. B. Simpson, writing at a later date, decided based on the Black Books that the Benchers were not the original governing body, and that the Inn was instead ruled by Governors (or &quot;gubernatores&quot;), sometimes called Rulers, who led the Inn. The Governors were elected to serve a year-long term, with between four and six sitting at any one time.

The first record of Benchers comes from 1478, when John Glynne was expelled from the Society for using &quot;presumptious and unsuitable words&quot; in front of the governors and &quot;other fellows of the Bench&quot;, and a piece of legislation passed in 1489 was &quot;ordained by the governors and other the worshipfuls of the Bench&quot;. By the late 15th century, the ruling group were the Governors (who were always Benchers) with assistance and advice from the other &quot;masters of the Bench&quot;, and occasional votes from the entire Society. The Benchers were still subordinate to the Governors, however; a note from 1505 shows the admission of two Benchers &quot;to aid and advice for the good governing of the Inn, but not to vote&quot;. The practice of using Governors died out in 1572 and, from 1584, the term was applied to Benchers, with the power of a Governor and a new Bencher being synonymous.

There are approximately 296 Benchers as of November 2013, with the body consisting of those members of the Inn elected to high judicial office, those who have sat as King&#x27;s Counsel for six or seven years and some of the more distinguished &quot;junior&quot; barristers (those barristers who are not King&#x27;s Counsel). There are also &quot;additional benchers&quot;—members of the Inn who have been successful in a profession other than the law, who have the rights of a normal bencher except that they cannot hold an office, such as Treasurer. In addition there are &quot;honorary benchers&quot;, who hold all the rights of a Bencher except the right to vote and the right to hold an office. These are people of &quot;sufficient distinction&quot; who have been elected by the Inn, and includes people such as Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

In common with the other Inns, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn also has a &quot;Royal Bencher&quot;—a member or members of the Royal Family who have been elected Benchers. The present Royal Bencher is Duke of Kent who was elected after the death of the previous incumbent Princess Margaret. In 1943, when she was elected as Royal Bencher, Queen Mary became the first female Bencher in any Inn. His Royal Highness Prince Andrew Duke of York was elected a Royal Bencher in December 2012.

==Buildings and architectural points of note==
Lincoln’s Inn’s estate comprises collegiate buildings, barristers’ chambers, commercial premises and residential apartments. The Inn is situated between Chancery Lane and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, north of Inner and Middle Temples and south of Gray&#x27;s Inn. Lincoln&#x27;s Inn is surrounded by a brick wall separating it from the neighbourhood; this was first erected in 1562, and it is said that Ben Jonson did some of the brickwork. The only surviving part is that on the western side between the North Lawn and the Fields. As well as the major buildings discussed below, the Inn consists of: Old Square, Old Buildings, Stone Buildings and Hardwicke buildings.

First built in 1683, New Square, sometimes known as Serle Court, finished in about 1697. New Square was originally named Serle&#x27;s Court because it was built as a compromise between the Inn and Henry Serle over ownership of the land. A compromise was made in 1682, and Serle built 11 brick sets of chambers on three sides of the square between 1682 and 1693. Alterations were made in 1843, when the open area in the middle was replaced by gardens and lawns. Because of its difficult history of ownership, some parts of the Square are still freehold, with individuals owning floors or sections of floors within the buildings. The Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Act 1860 was passed directly to allow the Inn to charge the various freeholders in the Square fees.

Stone Buildings was built between 1775 and 1780 using the designs of Robert Taylor, with the exception of No. 7, which was completed the range in the same style in 1845. The design was originally meant to be part of a massive rebuilding of the entire Inn, but this was never completed. Stone Buildings were seriously damaged during The Blitz, but their external appearance remains much the same. From &quot;within&quot; it appears as a cul de sac rather than a square, the two ranges closed to the north with a third which originally contained the library. The eastern side along Chancery Lane and the western backing onto the North Lawn. These provide the standard layout of &quot;staircases&quot; of working chambers. From the North Lawn there is no access but the west range provides a fine institutional range of some distinction.

No. 10 was originally provided by the Inn to strengthen its ties with Chancery (which used to be held in the Old Hall) as the office of the Six Clerks of the Court of Chancery, with the Inn taking it back when the Clerks were abolished and the Court moved to the Royal Courts of Justice in 1882. It is currently used as the headquarters of the Inns of Court &amp; City Yeomanry, part of the Territorial Army. The Officers Mess facilities make use of the principal rooms. Lincoln&#x27;s Inn has maintained a corps of volunteers in times of war since 1585, when 95 members of the Inn made a pledge to protect Queen Elizabeth against Spain. George III gave the then-temporary unit the epithet &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot;, which remains attached to the Regiment to this day. There is a large War Memorial between New Square and the North lawn containing the names of the members of the Inn killed in the First World War and World War 2.

Old Square and Old Buildings were built between 1525 and 1609, initially running between numbers 1 and 26. Although 1 exists near the Gatehouse, the others now only run from 16 to 24, with some buildings having been merged to the point where the entrances for 25 and 26 now frame windows, not doorways. Hardwicke Buildings was built in the 1960s, was originally named &quot;Hale Court&quot;, between the east range of New Square name changed in the 1990s. The buildings of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in Old Square, New Square and Stone Buildings are normally divided into four or five floors of barristers&#x27; chambers, with residential flats on the top floor. The buildings are used both by barristers and solicitors and other professional bodies.

===Old Hall===

The Old Hall dates from at least 1489, when it replaced the smaller &quot;bishops hall&quot;. The Old Hall is 71 feet long and 32 feet wide, although little remains of the original size and shape; it was significantly altered in 1625, 1652, 1706 and 1819. A former librarian reported that it was &quot;extensively remodelled&quot; by Francis Bernasconi in 1800. This remodelling led to the covering of the oak beams with a curved plaster ceiling, &quot;a most barbarous innovation&quot;. The weight of the plaster created the risk that the roof would collapse, and between 1924 and 1927 Sir John Simpson dismantled the entire hall, straightening warped timbers, removing the plaster, replacing any unserviceable sections and then putting the entire hall back together. It was reopened on 22 November 1928 by Queen Mary.

As well as its use for revels, moots and feasts, the Old Hall was also used as a court. The Master of the Rolls sat there between 1717 and 1724 while the Rolls Court was being rebuilt, and Lord Talbot used it as a court in 1733. From 1737 onward it was used to house the Court of Chancery, a practice that ended with the opening of the Royal Courts of Justice. The Hall&#x27;s most famous use as a court is in the start of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Bleak House&quot;, which opens with &quot;London. Michaelmas Term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Hall&quot;. It is now used for examinations, lectures, social functions and can be hired for private events. In 2010 the Hall was refurbished and its Crypt was improved and made more accessible by the installation of a staircase from the outside.

===Chapel===

The first mention of a chapel in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn comes from 1428. By the 17th century, this had become too small, and discussions started about building a new one in 1608. The current chapel was built between 1620 and 1623 by Inigo Jones, and was extensively rebuilt in 1797 and again in 1883. Other repairs took place in 1685, after the consultation of Christopher Wren, and again in 1915. The chapel is built on a fan-vaulted, open undercroft and has acted (sometimes simultaneously) as a crypt, meeting place and place of recreation. For many years only Benchers were allowed to be buried in the Crypt, with the last one being interred on 15 May 1852. Before that, however, it was open to any member or servant of the society; in 1829 a former Preacher was interred, and in 1780 William Turner, described as &quot;Hatch-keeper and Washpot to this Honble. Society&quot;, was buried.

The chapel has a bell said to date from 1596, although this is not considered likely. Traditionally, the bell would chime a curfew at 9 pm, with a stroke for each year of the current Treasurer&#x27;s age. The bell would also chime between 12:30 and 1:00 pm when a Bencher had died. Inside the chapel are six stained glass windows, three on each side, designed by the Van Linge family.

The chapel&#x27;s first pipe organ was a Flight &amp; Robson model installed in 1820. A substantial William Hill organ replaced it in 1856; a model designed at the peak of his skill, with thick lead and tin pipes, a set of pedals, and three manuals. During its service years it was rebuilt nine times, the final overhaul carried out in 1969. In the 2000s the organ, increasingly unreliable, was seen to have little unaltered initial material, with little hope of returning it to original condition, and it was replaced with a Kenneth Tickell model, the new organ installed during 2009–2010.

The chapel is used for concerts throughout the year.

===Great Hall===

The Great Hall, or New Hall, was constructed during the 19th century. The Inn&#x27;s membership had grown to the point where the Old Hall was too small for meetings, and so the Benchers decided to construct a new hall, also containing sizable rooms for their use, and a library. The new building was designed by Philip Hardwick, with the foundation stone laid on 20 April 1843 by James Lewis Knight-Bruce, the Treasurer.

The building was completed by 1845, and opened by Queen Victoria on 30 October. The Hall is long, wide, and high, much larger than the Old Hall. The Great Hall is used for the call to the Bar, as a dining place and for concerts arranged through the Bar Musical Society.

The lower ground floor was divided by a mezzanine in 2007 and the upper part became the Members Common Room for informal dining and with a lounge. It replaced the Junior Common Room, Barristers Members Room and Benchers Room as a social facility. In effect it is a club providing bar and restaurant facilities for all &quot;entitled&quot; persons, meaning members of the Inn and its &quot;bona fide&quot; tenants.

===Library===

The Library was first mentioned in 1471, and originally existed in a building next to the Old Hall before being moved to a set of chambers at No. 2 Stone Buildings in 1787. A bequest by John Nethersale in 1497 is recorded as an early acquisition.

The current Library was built as part of the complex containing the Great Hall, to the designs of Hardwick and was finished in 1845 being formally opened by Queen Victoria. At this point it was 80 feet long, 40 feet wide and 44 feet high. It was extended, almost doubled, in 1872 by George Gilbert Scott in the same style. The ground floor contained a Court room which became part of the Library facilities when the Court of Chancery moved out of the Inn in the 1880s. It has since 2010 been utilised as a lecture room and during the developments of 2016 to 2018 became the &#x27;interim&#x27; Members Common Room.

The Library contains a large collection of rare books, including the Hale Manuscripts, the complete collection of Sir Matthew Hale, which he left to the Inn on his death in 1676. The Library also contains over 1,000 other rare manuscripts, and approximately 2,000 pamphlets. The total collection of the Library, including textbooks and practitioners works, is approximately 150,000 volumes. The collection also includes a complete set of Parliamentary records. The Library is open to all students and barristers of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, as well as outside scholars and solicitors by application.

The Library is primarily a reference library, so borrowing is restricted. The only other lending service available is offered by Middle Temple Library, which permits barristers and students of any Inn, on production of suitable ID, to borrow current editions of textbooks that are not loose-leaf – but not any other material – half an hour before closing for return by half an hour after opening the following day.

===Gatehouse===
The Gatehouse from Chancery Lane is the oldest existing part of the Inn, and was built between 1518 and 1521. The Gatehouse was mainly built thanks to the efforts of Sir Thomas Lovell, the Treasurer at the time, who provided at least a third of the funds and oversaw the construction itself—as a result, his coat of arms hang on the gate, along with those of the Earl of Lincoln and Henry VIII (the king at the time).

The Gatehouse is a large tower four stories high and features diagonal rows of darker bricks, along with a set of oak gates that date from 1564. The Gatehouse was restored in 1695 and again between 1967 and 1969—the arms of the Treasurers for those years (Lord Upjohn, John Hawles and Princess Margaret) were added to the inwards side of the Gatehouse itself. Minor repairs also took place in 1815, when the three Coats of Arms were repaired and cleaned.

===New Square Lawn===
The New Square Lawn is surrounded by the block of New Square. It is bordered by the Lincoln Inn chambers, and is visible from the western Gatehouse. Centred on the New Square Lawn is Jubilee Fountain. After the original fountain from 1970 was removed, William Pye installed the new Jubilee fountain in 2003, to celebrate Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. The construction of the fountain was funded by David Shirley. 
The Jubilee fountain is a two tier fountain centered in New Square. The top level of the fountain creates arches in the air with the water, and the lower level has complementary tiny fountains. A photo of the fountain can be found on the designer&#x27;s website.

===East Terrace Underground development, New Library and New Teaching Facilities===
The Inn self-funded a major improvement and extension of its facilities between 2016 and 2018. The Inn being a conservation area and consisting of listed buildings could not simply add modern structures within the precincts without considerable difficulty of their impact on the current layout and planning objections by interest groups, as well indeed from members of the Inn. The improvement requirements for the Library and teaching activities were partly addressed by demolition of the Under Treasurer&#x27;s House on the north side of the Library, which was a post-WW2 building, replacing it with an extension to the Reading Rooms and Book Stack. The solution of providing a 150-seat Lecture Theatre and Tutorial Rooms was to exploit the space under the large east terrace of the Great Hall.

The Inn decided to name the new education suite the Ashworth Centre after Mercy Ashworth, one of the first women to be called to the bar by Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. On 13 December 2018, HM Queen Elizabeth II along with the Duke of York (Royal Bencher of the Inn) officially opened the Ashworth Centre and re-opened the Great Hall following its renovation. The Great Hall was originally opened by Queen Victoria in 1845.

==Coat of arms==

For many years, the Inn used the arms of the 3rd Earl of Lincoln as their own; in blazon, a &quot;lion rampant purpure in a field or&quot;, which is a purple lion on a gold field. Around 1699, Sir Richard Holford discovered the Inn&#x27;s own coat of arms on a manuscript, granted to them in 1516. The arms are &quot;azure seme de fer moline or, on a dexter canton or a lion rampant purpure&quot;. Following validation using some heraldry books, the arms were placed first in the council chamber and then in the library. Since then, they have been used continuously in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

<text>The twelve leverage points to intervene in a system were proposed by Donella Meadows, a scientist and system analyst who studied environmental limits to economic growth.

== History ==
The leverage points, first published in 1997, were inspired by Meadows&#x27; attendance at a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) meeting in the early 1990s, where she realized a very large new system was being proposed but the mechanisms to manage it were ineffective. Meadows, who worked in the field of systems analysis, proposed a scale of places to intervene in a system. Awareness and manipulation of these levers is an aspect of self-organization and can lead to collective intelligence. Her observations are often cited in energy economics, green economics and human development theory.

Meadows started with the observation that there are levers, or places within a complex system (such as a firm, a city, an economy, a living being, an ecosystem, an ecoregion) where a &quot;small shift in one thing can produce big changes in everything&quot; (compare: constraint in the sense of the theory of constraints).

She claimed we need to know about these shifts, where they are, and how to use them. She said most people know where these points are instinctively, but tend to adjust them in the wrong direction. A greater understanding would help solve global problems such as unemployment, hunger, economic stagnation, pollution, resources depletion, and conservation issues.

Meadows started with a nine-point list of such places, and expanded it to a list of twelve leverage points with explanations and examples, for systems in general. She describes a system as being in a certain state, consisting of a stock and flow, with inflows (amounts entering the system) and outflows (amounts leaving the system). At a given time, the system is in a certain perceived state. There may also be a goal for the system to be in a certain state. The difference between the current state and the goal is the discrepancy.

==Leverage points to intervene in a system==
The following are in increasing order of effectiveness.

=== 12. Constants, parameters, numbers ===
Parameters are points of lowest leverage effects. Though they are the most clearly perceived among all leverages, they rarely change behaviors and therefore have little long-term effect. 

=== 11. The size of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows ===
A &#x27;s ability to stabilize a system is important when the stock amount is much higher than the potential amount of inflows or outflows. In the lake, the water is the buffer: if there&#x27;s a lot more of it than inflow/outflow, the system stays stable. 

Buffers can improve a system, but they are often physical entities whose size is critical and can&#x27;t be changed easily.

=== 10. Structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport network, population age structures)===
A system&#x27;s structure may have enormous effect on operations, but may be difficult or prohibitively expensive to change. Fluctuations, limitations, and bottlenecks may be easier to address. 

=== 9. Length of delays, relative to the rate of system changes ===
Information received too quickly or too late can cause over- or underreaction, even oscillations. 

=== 8. Strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the effect they are trying to correct against===
A negative feedback loop slows down a process, tending to promote stability. The loop will keep the stock near the goal, thanks to parameters, accuracy and speed of information feedback, and size of correcting flows. 

=== 7. Gain around driving positive feedback loops===

A positive feedback loop speeds up a process. Meadows indicates that in most cases, it is preferable to slow down a positive loop, rather than speeding up a negative one.
=== 6. Structure of information flow (who does and does not have access to what kinds of information)===
Information flow is neither a parameter, nor a reinforcing or slowing loop, but a loop that delivers new information. It is cheaper and easier to change information flows than it is to change structure. 

=== 5. Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints)===
Pay attention to rules, and to who makes them. 

=== 4. Power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure===
Self-organization describes a system&#x27;s ability to change itself by creating new structures, adding new negative and positive feedback loops, promoting new information flows, or making new rules. 

=== 3. Goal of the system ===
Changing goals changes every item listed above: parameters, feedback loops, information and self-organization. 

=== 2. Mindset or paradigm that the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises from ===
A societal paradigm is an idea, a shared unstated assumption, or a system of thought that is the foundation of complex social structures. Paradigms are very hard to change, but there are no limits to paradigm change. Meadows indicates paradigms might be changed by repeatedly and consistently pointing out anomalies and failures in the current paradigm to those with open minds. 
:&quot;A current paradigm is &quot;Nature is a stock of resources to be converted to human purpose&quot;. What might happen to the lake were this collective idea changed ?&quot;

=== 1. Power to transcend paradigms===
Transcending paradigms may go beyond challenging fundamental assumptions, into the realm of changing the values and priorities that lead to the assumptions, and being able to choose among value sets at will.

<text>John Wesley Metcalf (born 12 November 1938) is an English-born Canadian writer, editor and critic.

==Personal life==
Metcalf was born in Carlisle, England on 12 November 1938. His father, Thomas Metcalf, was a clergyman and his mother, Gladys Moore Metcalf, was a teacher. He immigrated to Canada in 1962 and here began to write. In 1975 he married Myrna Teitelbaum and now lives with her in Ottawa, Ontario.

==Education==
Metcalf gained an Honours Bachelor of Arts and a Certificate in Education from the University of Bristol, prior to his immigration to Canada.

==Writing career==
Metcalf&#x27;s first attempt at writing fiction came when he entered the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Short Story Essay Contest which was followed by eight of his short stories being accepted by the Vancouver-based magazine &quot;Prism International&quot;. He supplemented his writing career with teaching jobs.

&quot;New Canadian Writing 1969&quot; included Metcalf&#x27;s first published stories. They followed a common theme of young people coming of age. He used a coming-of-age theme and the events that shape it extensively throughout his works. His first novella, &quot;The Lady Who Stole Furniture&quot;, was published in 1970, shortly after &quot;New Canadian Writing 1969&quot;. The narrator deals with the morality and integrity of his intimate relationship with an older woman. This novella first showcased Metcalf&#x27;s &quot;skill with dialogue, the idiom and rhythms of speech&quot;, which is seen in most of his work.

Many Metcalf works follow characters modeled after himself, young English teachers who immigrated to Canada and are displeased with the educational system. His first novel &quot;Going Down Slow&quot; follows a young teacher as described above as he deals with morality in the , and his second novel, &quot;General Ludd&quot;, describes a similar character, fighting the implementation of communications technology in his workplace.
&quot;The Teeth of My Father&quot; is a collection of short stories with the common theme of artists&#x27; relationships with society and their artwork and personal life. This theme was followed by, and extended in his &quot;Adult Entertainment&quot;. &quot;Girl in Gingham&quot; is a collection of two novellas. The first, &quot;Private Parts&quot;, chronicles one narrator&#x27;s &quot;sexual and spiritual childhood and adolescence&quot;. The second, &quot;Girl in Gingham&quot;, follows another narrator&#x27;s search for the perfect mate via an online dating service, with the undertone being his realization of people trying to invent themselves to fit what others want, or the ideals of their culture. Short story and novella forms are his preferred form of writing. He said when writing these, &quot;you got to get it dead right. A beat or two off and it&#x27;s ruined&quot;.

Metcalf is a longtime critic of Canadian &quot;cultural and educational inadequacies&quot;, and published &quot;Kicking Against the Pricks&quot; in 1982 to showcase this frustration. It was a collection of eight essays and included an interview with himself. To encourage debate on this theme within the literary community, he published &quot;The Bumper Book&quot; in 1986 and followed it with &quot;Carry On Bumping&quot; in 1988. Both collections consisted of contentious essays focussing on problems with Canadian literature. In an interview with Geoff Hancock, he asserted that &quot;the quality of the education has declined everywhere over the last 50 years as the number to be educated has risen&quot;. He is in &quot;conflict with the dominant nature of North American society&quot; and the influence it has on education.

Metcalf extensively contributed to Canadian literature through editing, teaching various educational levels across Canada, critiquing other writers, compiling anthologies and publishing and promoting Canadian writers. A &quot;storyteller, editor, novelist, essayist, critic&quot;, he is known for his satires of Canadian life and academia.

==Awards==
&quot;Forde Abroad&quot; won the 1996 Gold Medal for Fiction at the National Magazine Awards.
&quot;The Estuary&quot; won University of Western Ontario&#x27;s President&#x27;s Medal for the Best Story of 1969.
Metcalf was appointed as a Member of the Order of Canada in 2004.

<doc id="207885" wikidata="Q1233784" url="?curid=207885" title="Inner Temple">
<text>The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple, commonly known as the Inner Temple, is one of the four Inns of Court and is a professional association for barristers and judges. To be called to the Bar and practise as a barrister in England and Wales, a person must belong to one of these Inns. It is located in the wider Temple area, near the Royal Courts of Justice, and within the City of London. As a liberty, it functions largely as an independent local government authority.

The Inn is a professional body that provides legal training, selection, and regulation for members. It is ruled by a governing council called &quot;Parliament&quot;, made up of the Masters of the Bench (or &quot;Benchers&quot;), and led by the Treasurer, who is elected to serve a one-year term. The Temple takes its name from the Knights Templar, who originally (until their abolition in 1312) leased the land to the Temple&#x27;s inhabitants (Templars). The Inner Temple was a distinct society from at least 1388, although as with all the Inns of Court its precise date of founding is not known. After a disrupted early period (during which the Temple was almost entirely destroyed in the Peasants&#x27; Revolt) it flourished, becoming the second-largest Inn during the Elizabethan period (after Gray&#x27;s Inn).

The Inner Temple expanded during the reigns of James I and Charles I, with 1,700 students admitted between 1600 and 1640. The First English Civil War&#x27;s outbreak led to a complete suspension of legal education, with the Inns close to being shut down for almost four years. Following the English Restoration the Inner Templars welcomed Charles II back to London personally with a lavish banquet.

After a period of slow decline in the 18th century, the following 100 years saw a restoration of the Temple&#x27;s fortunes, with buildings constructed or restored, such as the Hall and the Library. Much of this work was destroyed during The Blitz, when the Hall, Temple, Temple Church, and many sets of barristers&#x27; chambers were devastated. Rebuilding was completed in 1959, and today the Temple is an active Inn of Court with over 8,000 members.

==Role==

The Inner Temple is one of the four Inns of Court, along with Gray&#x27;s Inn, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and the Middle Temple. The Inns are responsible for training, regulating, and selecting barristers within England and Wales, and are the only bodies allowed to call a barrister to the Bar and allow him or her to practice.

The Inner Temple is an independent, unincorporated organisation, and works as a trust. It has approximately 8,000 members and around 450 apply to join per year. Although the Inn was previously a disciplinary and teaching body, these functions are now shared between the four Inns, with the Bar Standards Board (a division of the General Council of the Bar) acting as a disciplinary body and the Inns of Court and Bar Educational Trust providing education.

==History==

===The Knights Templar and the founding of the Inner Temple===
The history of the Inner Temple begins in the early years of the reign of Henry II (1154–1189), when the contingent of Knights Templar in London moved from the Old Temple in Holborn to a new location on the banks of the River Thames, stretching from Fleet Street to what is now Essex House. The original Temple covered much of what is now the northern part of Chancery Lane (originally New Street), which the Knights created to provide access to their new buildings. The old Temple eventually became the London palace of the Bishop of Lincoln. After the Reformation it became the home of the Earl of Southampton, and the location is now named Southampton Buildings. The first group of lawyers came to live here during the 13th century, although as legal advisers to the Knights rather than as a society. The Knights fell out of favour, and the order was dissolved in 1312, with the land seized by the king and later granted to the Knights Hospitaller. The Hospitallers probably did not live on the property, but rather used it as a source of revenue through rent.
The secular, common law lawyers migrated to the hamlet of Holborn, as it was easy to get to the law courts at Westminster Hall and was just outside the City.

Two groups occupied the Hospitaller land, and became known as the &quot;inner inn&quot; (occupying the consecrated buildings near the centre of the Temple) and the &quot;middle inn&quot; (occupying the unconsecrated buildings between the &quot;inner inn&quot; and the Outer Temple). These became the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple, and were distinct societies by 1388, when they are mentioned in a year book. The Hospitallers leased the land to the Inner Temple for £10 a year, with students coming from Thavie&#x27;s Inn to study there.

===Early years===

There are few records of the Inner Temple from the 14th and 15th centuries—indeed, from all the societies, although Lincoln&#x27;s Inn&#x27;s records stretch back to 1422. The Temple was sacked by Wat Tyler and his rebels during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1381, with buildings pulled down and records destroyed. John Stow wrote that, after breaking into Fleet Prison, the rebels:

went to the Temple to destroy it, and plucked down the houses, tooke off the tyles of the other buildings left; went to the churche, tooke out all the bookes and remembrances that were m the hatches of the prentices of the law, carried them into the high street, and there burnt them. This house they spoyled for wrathe they bare to the prior of St. John&#x27;s, unto whom it belonged, and, after a number of them had sacked this Temple, what with labour and what with wine being overcome, they lay down under the walls and housing, and were slain like swyne, one of them killing another for old grudge and hatred, and others also made quick dispatch of them. A number of them that burnt the Temple went from thence to the Savoy, destroying in their way all the houses that belonged to the Hospital of St. John.
John Baker thinks that the inhabitants took the opportunity to rebuild much of the Temple, and that this was when the Temple&#x27;s Hall was built, since it contained 14th century roofing that would not have been available to the Knights Templar. The Inns of Court were similarly attacked in Jack Cade&#x27;s rebellion, although there are no specific records showing damage to the Inner Temple.

The Hospitallers&#x27; properties were confiscated and given to Henry VIII by a statute of 1539/40. The Benchers of the Inn then attorned to the crown and were tenants until 1608. Following a Scotsman&#x27;s request to purchase the land, the Inner and Middle Temples appealed to James I, who granted the land to a group of noted lawyers and Benchers, including Henry Montague and Sir Julius Caesar, and to &quot;their heirs and assignees for ever&quot; on the condition that the Inner and Middle Temples each paid him £10 a year.

===Elizabethan age===
The Elizabethan age saw a large amount of rebuilding and beautification within the Temple, and with over 100 sets of chambers it was the second largest Inn (after Gray&#x27;s Inn), with 155 residential students reported in 1574.

In winter 1561, the Inner Temple was the scene of an extraordinary set of revels that celebrated the raising of Robert Dudley as the Temple&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Prince&quot;, a role he was granted in gratitude for his intervention in a dispute with the Middle Temple over Lyon&#x27;s Inn, one of the Inns of Chancery that had historically been tied to the Inner Temple. Dudley&#x27;s influence swayed Elizabeth into asking Nicholas Bacon to rule in favour of the Inner Temple, and in gratitude the Parliament and Governors swore never to take a case against Dudley and to offer him their legal services whenever required.

This pledge was always honoured, and in 1576 the Inner Temple Parliament referred to Dudley as the &quot;chief governor of this House&quot;. The play was partially documented by Gerard Legh in his &quot;Accedens of Armory&quot;, a book of heraldry woodcuts, which described Dudley&#x27;s role as Prince Pallaphilos, the lieutenant of Athena and Patron of the Order of the Pegasus.

===Seventeenth century===

The Inner Temple continued to expand during the reigns of James I and Charles I, with 1,700 students admitted to the Inn between 1600 and 1640. The outbreak of the First English Civil War led to a complete suspension of legal education, with the Inns almost shut down for nearly four years; the Inns &quot;suffered a mortal collapse&quot;. Nothing was done to adapt the old system of legal education, which was declining anyway, to the new climate of internal war. After the end of the Civil War, the old system was not restored; Readers refused to read and both barristers and Benchers refused to follow the internal regulations. The last reading at Inner Temple was made in 1678.

Following the English Restoration, the Inner Temple welcomed Charles II back to London with a lavish banquet on 15 August 1661. The banquet was hosted by Sir Heneage Finch, the Speaker of the House of Commons and was attended by the King, four Dukes including the Duke of York, fourteen Earls of England, Scotland and Ireland, 6 Lords and the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. The group proceeded from Whitehall on the King&#x27;s barge, landed at the Temple and walked through the Temple Garden surrounded by all the Benchers, barristers and servants of the Temple, fifty of whom brought a lavish feast for the revellers. At the start of the next legal term, two Dukes including the Duke of York, two Earls and two Lords were admitted as members, and the Duke of York was called to the Bar and made an honorary Bencher.

During the rule of the House of Stuart, much was done by the Court of Star Chamber to enforce religious edicts against Catholicism within the Inner Temple. An order was sent directly to the Benchers proclaiming that no &quot;pson eyther convented or suspected for papistrye shulde be called eyther to the benche or to the barre&quot;, and at the same time Benchers were selected specifically because of their Protestant beliefs, with popular and successful Catholics held back.

This period also features an example of the independent standing of the Temple; in 1668 the Lord Mayor of London attempted to enter the Temple with his sword, something that was his right in the City but not permitted within the Temple. The students took his sword and forced him to spend the night in a set of chambers; when he escaped and tried to return, they called the Trained Bands. The Mayor complained to the King, who heard the case on 7 April 1669 and decided to allow it to be determined by law rather than by his royal privilege; the lawyers returned to the principle that the Temple could set its own internal rules on the right to carry swords.

Much of the Inn was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, and extensive damage was done in other fires in 1677 and 1678. One of these fires destroyed Caesar&#x27;s Buildings, on Middle Temple Lane where Lamb Buildings now stand, and the site was purchased by Middle Temple from Inner Temple, which needed the proceeds to repair or rebuild other buildings.

===Eighteenth century to the present===

The 18th century was a period of relative stability, with an element of decline. The Benchers of the time were described as &quot;opposed to all modern fashions, including new-fangled comforts&quot;, with the Inn&#x27;s buildings deteriorating.
Much of the Temple was rebuilt during the 19th century, most noticeably the Hall and Library, although fever and disease continued as a result of the Inn&#x27;s outdated systems; the same water was used both for drinking and for flushing the toilet, for example. 

In 1922 the Temple called Ivy Williams to the bar, making her the first female barrister in England and Wales. The Temple suffered massively during The Blitz in the Second World War, including attacks on 19 September and 26 September 1940, which destroyed the Library clocktower and the Hall respectively; on 10–11 May 1941 the Inn was hit by a series of incendiaries which destroyed the inside of Temple Church, the Hall, the Library and many sets of chambers. Fires continued to burn for another day, despite the assistance of the Fire Brigade and several barristers and employees.

It was decided not to start rebuilding until after the cessation of hostilities, and plans began in 1944, when the Temple contacted the War Damage Commission to provide the £1.5 million to cover the damage. £1.4 million was provided, with the rest found elsewhere. There was a further delay due to the Temple&#x27;s choice of architect, Hubert Worthington, who was so slow that the Benchers ended up replacing him with his junior associate, T.W. Sutcliffe, and eventually Sir Edward Maufe. The chambers were the priority, with parts of King&#x27;s Bench Walk finished in 1949, and the final building (the Library) was opened on 21 April 1958.


In 2001 the Inner Temple bought the neighbouring 1–2 Serjeant&#x27;s Inn, which can be accessed directly from the Inner Temple, with the intention of converting it to barristers&#x27; chambers. However, instead, the premises has been let on a 99-year lease to Apex Hotels. No. 3 Serjeant&#x27;s Inn has been a barristers&#x27; chambers, occupying commercial premises, since 1986. Mitre Court, which connects the Inner Temple area, Serjeant&#x27;s Inn and Fleet Street, is occupied as barristers&#x27; chambers, residential flats and more recently, solicitors.

==Structure and governance==
The Inner Temple is governed by the Parliament, an executive council made up of the elected Benchers. The Parliament is led by the Treasurer, who is elected annually to serve a one-year term; the Treasurer for 2023 is Sir Robert Francis KC. The Inner Temple also has a Reader, who traditionally holds the position for a year before being appointed as Treasurer; the Reader for 2023 is Richard Salter KC.

The Inner Temple was historically governed by a Treasurer and three Governors. Members were divided into two categories; Clerks (&quot;Clerici&quot;) admitted to Clerks&#x27; Commons and Fellows (&quot;Socii&quot;) admitted to Fellows&#x27; Commons. The Governors held Parliament with a small group of senior barristers; in 1508, for example, Parliament was held with three Governors and four senior barristers. The last Governor was elected in 1566, and Benchers took over later that century. Benchers, or Masters of the Bench, are elected members of the Parliament responsible for overseeing the estates, the Inn&#x27;s finances and setting internal policy. Today there are approximately 350 Governing Benchers (barristers and members of the judiciary) and honorary, academic and Royal Benchers appointed, as well as those practising in other jurisdictions.

===Coat of arms===

The coat of arms of the Inner Temple is, in blazon, &quot;Azure a pegasus salient argent&quot;, or a Pegasus. Gerard Legh is normally given the credit for having suggested the Pegasus as a coat of arms, having given an account of Robert Dudley playing the part of Prince Pallaphilos, a patron of the Honorable Order of Pegasus in the 1561 Christmas revels. It may alternately have come about because of the tiles in Temple Church, which show a knight on horseback with a shield and sword raised. From this point onwards, the arms were considered the Temple&#x27;s property, and they were confirmed by the College of Arms in 1967.

===Liberty===

Inner Temple (together with the neighbouring Middle Temple) is also one of the few remaining liberties, an old name for a type of administrative division. It is an independent extra-parochial area, historically not governed by the City of London Corporation (and is today regarded as a local authority for most purposes) and equally outside the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Bishop of London. The Inner Temple&#x27;s functions as a local council are set out in the Temples Order 1971.

It geographically falls within the boundaries and liberties of the City, but can be thought of as an independent enclave.

==Plate==
The Inner Temple is noted for its collection of silver and pewter plate, described in the early 20th century as similar in value to that of Oxford or Cambridge University. The first reference to plate is in 1534, with a silver cup left to the Temple as part of the estate of a Master Sutton. Further pieces were added over the next century, with Robert Bowes giving a silver gilt cup to Sir John Baker in 1552. The cup, which was shaped like a melon with feet formed from the &quot;tendrils&quot; of the melon, is a prized possession of the Temple. Nicholas Hare left three silver salt cellars for the use of the Benchers in 1597. Two silver candlesticks were bought in 1606, another salt cellar in 1610 and six silver spoons in 1619. A large part of the &quot;house plate&quot; was stolen in 1643, and it is unknown whether it was recovered, although money was spent in prosecuting the offender.

Two silver cups were bought in 1699, and records from 1 January 1703 show that the Temple owned one gilt cup (the &quot;melon&quot; cup) five salt cellars, ten large cups, twelve
little cups, and twenty-three spoons. Twelve more spoons were bought in 1707, along with another silver cup, and at some point in this period the Temple purchased or was given a &quot;nef&quot;. A dozen teaspoons were bought in 1750, a coffee pot in 1788 and an &quot;argyle&quot; or gravy holder in 1790.

==Buildings==

The Inner Temple contains many buildings, some modern and some ancient, although only Temple Church dates back to the time of the Knights Templars who originally inhabited the site.

===Chambers===
The Inn contains several buildings and sets of buildings used to house barristers&#x27; chambers, with those rooms above the second floor generally being residential in nature. The sets are Crown Office Row, Dr Johnson&#x27;s Buildings, Farrar&#x27;s Building, Francis Taylor Building, Harcourt Buildings, Hare Court, King&#x27;s Bench Walk, Littleton Building, Mitre Court Buildings, Paper Buildings and the eastern side of Temple Gardens.

Crown Office Row was named after the Crown Office, which used to sit on the site and was removed in 1621. The first building (described by Charles Dugdale as &quot;the Great Brick Building over against the Garden&quot;) was constructed in 1628, and completely replaced in 1737. The current buildings were designed and built by Sir Edward Maufe. Charles Lamb was born in No. 2 Crown Office Row, which was destroyed during the Second World War, and Thomas Coventry maintained a set of chambers there.

Harcourt Buildings were first built in 1703 by John Banks and named after Simon Harcourt, the Treasurer of the time. There were three buildings, 50 feet wide, 27 feet deep and 3 storeys high. Replacements were constructed between 1832 and 1833, and were not particularly attractive—Hugh Bellot said that they &quot;could scarcely be more unsightly&quot;. These replacements were destroyed in 1941, and new buildings were built based on a design by Hubert Worthington.

Hare Court was named after Nicholas Hare, who built the first set in 1567. The west and south sides were destroyed in the fire of 1678. On 31 May 1679 orders were given to replace the west side with four new buildings three storeys high, which were funded by the Treasurer (Thomas Hanmer) and the tenants at the time, including Judge Jeffreys. The Court features a pump, the water of which was noted in the 19th century for its purity.

King&#x27;s Bench Walk has contained buildings since at least 1543, although these were burnt down in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and their replacements destroyed in another fire in 1677. The buildings take their name from the Office of the King&#x27;s Bench, which was situated in the row and destroyed in the 1677 fire. Buildings were reconstructed in 1678 and 1684, and a noted inhabitant of these early constructs was Lord Mansfield. The current buildings date from the first, 1678 construction to, most recently, chambers built in 1948.

Mitre Court Buildings are on the site of Fuller&#x27;s Rents, constructed in 1562 by John Fuller, the Temple&#x27;s Treasurer. Noted residents of chambers here included Sir Edward Coke. Mitre Court was erected on the site in 1830, and based on a design by Robert Smirke. While constructing it the labourers found a hoard of 67 guineas dated from the reigns of monarchs from Charles II to George II, which were confiscated by the Clerk of the Works.

Paper Buildings are on the site of Heyward&#x27;s Buildings, constructed in 1610. The &quot;paper&quot; part of the name comes from the fact that they were built from timber, lath and plaster, a construction method known as &quot;paperwork&quot;. A fire in 1838 destroyed three of the buildings, which were immediately replaced with a design by Robert Smirke, with Sydney Smirke later adding two more buildings. A famous resident of (at the time) Heyward&#x27;s Buildings was John Selden, who was one of the original tenants and shared a set of chambers with Heyward himself.

===Gardens and Gateway===

Inner Temple Gardens were laid out around 1601, with a set of decorated railings added in 1618 with the Temple&#x27;s pegasus and the griffin of Gray&#x27;s Inn, a sign of the strong relationship between the two; the design was included in the new iron gates made in 1730, which are still present. The gardens contain various landmarks, including a sundial from 1707 by Edward Strong the Elder, a pair of cisterns dated from 1730 and a lead statute of a blackmoor by John Nost, which was transferred from Clifford&#x27;s Inn when Clifford&#x27;s was destroyed. A rookery was established during the 18th century by Edward Northey, who brought a colony of crows from his estates in Epsom to fill it. The gardens were previously noted for their roses, and William Shakespeare claimed that the Wars of the Roses started in the Inner Temple Garden. The gardens have recently been the subject of substantial restoration under the auspices of the Master of the Garden, Oliver Sells QC. In 1870 Robert Marnock re-designed the Inner Temple Garden.

The Gateway, at the top of Inner Temple Lane on Fleet Street, is thought to have existed in the same location since the founding of the Temples by the Knights Templar. It was rebuilt in 1610 by John Bennett, the King&#x27;s Serjeant-at-Arms, and again rebuilt in 1748. The building above it (which is not owned by the Inn) is reputed to have been the council chambers of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales and Charles, Prince of Wales, later Charles I.

===Hall===
The original Knights&#x27; Templar Hall was replaced in the fourteenth or fifteenth century. It was extensively repaired in 1606 and 1629, but was still in poor condition in 1816. Despite this, little was done at that time but replacing the timbers which had gone rotten and patching the crumbling walls with brick. As a result of the poor condition and the increasing numbers of barristers, it was demolished in 1868.

Its replacement was a larger hall in the Gothic style, designed by Sydney Smirke, which was opened on 14 May 1870 by Princess Louise. The new Hall was 94 feet long, 41 feet wide and 40 feet high, with glass windows featuring the coats of arms of noted Treasurers from 1506 onwards running around the room. There were two doors, one to the south and one to the north, which are said by William Dugdale to be the remnants of a &quot;great carved screen&quot; erected in 1574.

The Hall was destroyed during the Second World War, and the foundation stone for the new hall was laid by Queen Elizabeth in 1952. The building was designed by Hubert Worthington and opened in 1955 as part of a complex involving the Hall, Library and Benchers&#x27; Chambers.

===Library===

The original Library existed from at least 1506, and consisted of a single room. This was not a dedicated library, as it was also used for dining when there were too many barristers for the hall, and later for moots. By 1607 a second room had been added, and Edward Coke donated a copy of his &quot;Reports&quot; for the library a year later. The Library of the Inner Temple was far superior to those of the other Inns of Court, and &quot;placed the House far in advance of the other societies&quot;.

The Library refused to accept John Selden&#x27;s manuscripts in 1654, most likely because the size of the collection would necessitate a new building, but it has been described as &quot;the greatest loss which the Library of the Inner Temple ever sustained&quot;. The Library was entirely destroyed in the Great Fire of London, but a replacement was built in 1668. A second, smaller fire in 1679 necessitated the destruction of one library building to act as a firebreak and save the hall.

In 1707 the Inner Temple was offered the Petyt Manuscripts and a sum of £150 to build a new Library, which was completed in 1709 and consisted of three rooms. A Librarian was appointed immediately, and the practice continues to this day. Modifications were made in 1867, 1872 and 1882 which extended the Library to eight rooms A new Library was built on the site of the old one in the 19th century, with the north wing being completed in 1882, and contained 26,000 law volumes, as well as 36,000 historical and architectural texts. This building was destroyed during the Second World War, and although some of the rarest manuscripts had been moved off site, 45,000 books were lost. A replacement Library was built in 1958, and currently contains approximately 70,000 books.

===Temple Church===

Temple Church has been described as &quot;the finest of the four round churches still existing in London&quot;. The original Round was constructed in 1185 by the Knights Templar and consecrated by the Patriarch of Jerusalem on 10 February. The church was highly regarded during this period, with William the Marshal buried there and Henry III initially making plans before changing to Westminster Abbey.

After the fall of the Templars the church, along with the rest of the Temple, fell into the hands of the Knights Hospitaller, and from there passed to Henry VIII, who appointed a priest, known as the Master of the Temple. The Royal Charter granted by James I that guaranteed the independence of the Inner and Middle Temples did so on the condition that the Temples maintain the church, a requirement which has been followed to this day. Both societies also own the Master&#x27;s House next to the church, a Georgian townhouse built in 1764.

During the reign of Charles II the elegant columns which had dominated the church were covered with oak wainscotting. Repairs to the east end of the church took place in 1707, and the exterior of the north and east sides was repaired in 1737. Some further repairs took place in 1811, but the main restoration happened in 1837, when Robert Smirke restored the south side and removed most of the wainscotting. This was followed with more repairs in 1845, which lowered the floor to its original height, removed ugly whitewash which had been added a century earlier and led to the discovery of a marble piscina at the east end.

All of this work was destroyed on 10 May 1941 during the Second World War when firebombs gutted the church. Over the next decade the church was restored, and it was reconsecrated in 1954 by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

<text>The Honourable Society of Gray&#x27;s Inn, commonly known as Gray&#x27;s Inn, is one of the four Inns of Court (professional associations for barristers and judges) in London. To be called to the bar in order to practise as a barrister in England and Wales, an individual must belong to one of these inns. Located at the intersection of High Holborn and Gray&#x27;s Inn Road in Central London, the Inn is a professional body and provides office and some residential accommodation for barristers. It is ruled by a governing council called &quot;Pension&quot;, made up of the Masters of the Bench (or &quot;benchers&quot;) and led by the Treasurer, who is elected to serve a one-year term. The Inn is known for its gardens (the &quot;Walks&quot;), which have existed since at least 1597.

Gray&#x27;s Inn does not claim a specific foundation date; none of the Inns of Court claims to be any older than the others. Law clerks and their apprentices have been established on the present site since at latest 1370, with records dating from 1381. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the Inn grew in size, peaking during the reign of Elizabeth I. The Inn was home to many important barristers and politicians, including Francis Bacon. Queen Elizabeth herself was a patron. As a result of the efforts of prominent members such as William Cecil and Gilbert Gerard, Gray&#x27;s Inn became the largest of the four Inns by number, with over 200 barristers recorded as members. During this period, the Inn mounted masques and revels. William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; is believed first to have been performed in Gray&#x27;s Inn Hall.

The Inn continued to prosper during the reign of James I (1603–1625) and the beginning of that of Charles I, when over 100 students per year were recorded as joining. The outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642 during the reign of Charles I disrupted the systems of legal education and governance at the Inns of Court, shutting down all calls to the bar and new admissions, and Gray&#x27;s Inn never fully recovered. Fortunes continued to decline after the English Restoration, which saw the end of the then-traditional method of legal education. Now more prosperous, Gray&#x27;s Inn is today the smallest of the Inns of Court.
==Role==

Gray&#x27;s Inn and the other three Inns of Court remain the only bodies legally allowed to call a barrister to the Bar, allowing him or her to practise in England and Wales. Although the Inn was previously a disciplinary and teaching body, these functions are now shared between the four Inns, with the Bar Standards Board (a division of the General Council of the Bar) acting as a disciplinary body and the Inns of Court and Bar Educational Trust providing education. The Inn remains a collegiate self-governing, unincorporated association of its members, providing within its precincts library, dining, residential and office accommodation (barristers&#x27; chambers), along with a chapel. Members of the Bar from other Inns may use these facilities to some extent.

==History==
During the 12th and early 13th centuries, the law was taught in the City of London, primarily by the clergy. Then two events happened which ended the Church&#x27;s role in legal education: firstly, a papal bull that prohibited the clergy from teaching the common law, rather than canon law; and secondly, a decree by Henry III of England on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London. The common law began to be practised and taught by laymen instead of clerics, and these lawyers migrated to the hamlet of Holborn, just outside the city and near to the law courts at Westminster Hall.
===Founding and early years===
The early records of all four Inns of Court have been lost, and it is not known precisely when each was founded. The records of Gray&#x27;s Inn itself are lost until 1569, and the precise date of founding cannot therefore be verified. Lincoln&#x27;s Inn has the earliest surviving records. Gray&#x27;s Inn dates from at least 1370, and takes its name from the 1st Baron Grey de Wilton, as the Inn was originally Lord Grey&#x27;s family townhouse (or inn) within the Manor of Portpoole. A lease was taken for various parts of the inn by practising lawyers as both residential and working accommodation, and their apprentices were housed with them. From this the tradition of dining in &quot;commons&quot;, probably by using the inn&#x27;s main hall, followed as the most convenient arrangement for the members. Outside records from 1437 show that Gray&#x27;s Inn was occupied by &quot;socii&quot;, or members of a society, at that date.

In 1456 the 7th Baron Grey de Wilton, the owner of the Manor itself, sold the land to a group including Thomas Bryan. A few months later, the other members signed deeds of release, granting the property solely to Bryan. Bryan acted as either a feoffee or an owner representing the governing body of the Inn (there are some records suggesting he may have been a Bencher at this point) but in 1493 he transferred the ownership by charter to a group including Sir Robert Brudenell and Thomas Wodeward, reverting the ownership of the Inn partially back to the Grey family.

In 1506 the Inn was sold by the Grey family to Hugh Denys and a group of his feoffees including Roger Lupton. This was not a purchase on behalf of the society and after a five-year delay, it was transferred under the will of Denys in 1516 to the Carthusian House of Jesus of Bethlehem (Sheen Priory), which remained the Society&#x27;s landlord until 1539, when the Second Act of Dissolution led to the Dissolution of the Monasteries and passed ownership of the Inn to the Crown.

===Elizabethan golden age===
During the reign of Elizabeth I, Gray&#x27;s Inn rose in prominence, and the Elizabethan era is considered the &quot;golden age&quot; of the Inn, with Elizabeth serving as the Patron Lady. This can be traced to the actions of Nicholas Bacon, William Cecil and Gilbert Gerard, all prominent members of the Inn and confidantes of Elizabeth. Cecil and Bacon in particular took pains to find the most promising young men and get them to join the Inn. In 1574 it was the largest of all the Inns of Court by number, with 120 barristers, and by 1619 it had a membership of more than 200 barristers.

Gray&#x27;s Inn, as well as the other Inns of Court, became noted for the parties and festivals it hosted. Students performed masques and plays in court weddings, in front of Queen Elizabeth herself, and hosted regular festivals and banquets at Candlemas, All Hallows Eve and Easter. At Christmas the students ruled the Inn for the day, appointing a Lord of Misrule called the &quot;Prince of Purpoole&quot;, and organising a masque entirely on their own, with the Benchers and other senior members away for the holiday.

The Gray&#x27;s Inn masque in 1588 with its centrepiece, &quot;The Misfortunes of Arthur&quot; by Thomas Hughes, is considered by A.W. Ward to be the most impressive masque thrown at any of the Inns. William Shakespeare performed at the Inn at least once, as his patron, Lord Southampton, was a member. For the Christmas of 1594, his play &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; was performed by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men before a riotous assembly of notables in such disorder that the affair became known as the &quot;Night of Errors&quot; and a mock trial was held to arraign the culprit.

Central to Gray&#x27;s was the system shared across the Inns of Court of progress towards a call to the Bar, which lasted approximately 12 to 14 years. A student would first study at either Oxford or Cambridge University, or at one of the Inns of Chancery, which were dedicated legal training institutions. If he studied at Oxford or Cambridge he would spend three years working towards a degree, and be admitted to one of the Inns of Court after graduation. If he studied at one of the Inns of Chancery he would do so for one year before seeking admission to the Inn of Court to which his Inn of Chancery was tied—in the case of Gray&#x27;s Inn, the attached Inns of Chancery were Staple Inn and Barnard&#x27;s Inn.

The student was then considered an &quot;inner barrister&quot;, and would study in private, take part in the moots and listen to the readings and other lectures. After serving from six to nine years as an &quot;inner barrister&quot;, the student was called to the Bar, assuming he had fulfilled the requirements of having argued twice at moots in one of the Inns of Chancery, twice in the Hall of his Inn of Court and twice in the Inn Library. The new &quot;utter barrister&quot; was then expected to supervise bolts (&quot;arguments&quot; over a single point of law between students and barristers) and moots at his Inn of Court, attend lectures at the Inns of Court and Chancery and teach students. After five years as an &quot;utter&quot; barrister he was allowed to practice in court—after 10 years he was made an Ancient.

The period saw the establishment of a regular system of legal education. In the early days of the Inn, the quality of legal education had been poor—readings were given infrequently, and the standards for call to the Bar were weak and varied. During the Elizabethan age readings were given regularly, moots took place daily and barristers who were called to the Bar were expected to play a part in teaching students, resulting in skilled and knowledgeable graduates from the Inn.
Many noted barristers, judges and politicians were members of the Inn during this period, including Gilbert Gerard, Master of the Rolls, Edmund Pelham, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and Francis Bacon, who served as Treasurer for eight years, supervising significant changes to the facilities of the Inn and the first proper construction of the gardens and walks for which the Inn is noted.

===Caroline period and the English Civil War===

At the start of the Caroline era, when Charles I came to the throne, the Inn continued to prosper. Over 100 students were admitted to the Inn each year, and except during the plague of 1636 the legal education of students continued. Masques continued to be held, including one in 1634 organised by all four Inns that cost £21,000—approximately £ in 2025 terms. Before 1685 the Inn counted as members five dukes, three marquises, twenty-nine earls, five viscounts and thirty-nine barons, and during that period &quot;none can exhibit a more illustrious list of great men&quot;.

Many academics, including William Holdsworth, a man considered to be one of the best legal academics in history, maintain that this period saw a decline in the standard of teaching at all the Inns. From 1640 onwards no readings were held, and barristers such as Sir Edward Coke remarked at the time that the quality of education at the Inns of Court had decreased. Holdsworth put this down to three things—the introduction of printed books, the disinclination of students to attend moots and readings and the disinclination of the Benchers and Readers to enforce attendance.

With the introduction of printing, written legal texts became more available, reducing the need for students to attend readings and lectures. However, this meant that the students denied themselves the opportunity to query what they had learnt or discuss it in greater detail. Eventually, as students now had a way to learn without attending lectures, they began to excuse themselves from lectures, meetings and moots altogether; in the early 17th century they developed a way of deputising other students to do their moots for them. The Benchers and Readers did little to arrest the decline of the practice of lecturers and readings, first because many probably believed (as the students did) that books were an adequate substitute, and secondly because many were keen to avoid the work of preparing a reading, which cut into their time as practising barristers. These problems were endemic to all the Inns, not just Gray&#x27;s Inn.

The outbreak of the First English Civil War led to a complete suspension of legal education, and from November 1642 until July 1644 no Pension meetings were held. Only 43 students were admitted during the four years of the war, and none were called to the Bar. Meetings of Pension resumed after the Battle of Marston Moor but the education system remained dormant. Although Readers were appointed, none read, and no moots were held. In 1646, after the end of the war, there was an attempt to restore the old system of readings and moots, and in 1647 an order was made that students were required to moot at least once a day. This failed to work, with Readers refusing to read, and the old system of legal education completely died out.

The Caroline period saw a decline in prosperity for Gray&#x27;s Inn. Although there were many notable members of the Inn, both legal (Sir Dudley Digges, Thomas Bedingfield and Francis Bacon, for example) and non-legal (including William Juxon, the Archbishop of Canterbury), the list could not compare to that of the Elizabethan period. Following the English Restoration, admissions fell to an average of 57 a year.

===English Restoration to present===
The fortunes of Gray&#x27;s Inn continued to decline after the English Restoration, and by 1719 only 22 students were joining the Inn a year. This fall in numbers was partly because the landed gentry were no longer sending sons who had no intention of becoming barristers to study at the Inn. In 1615, 13 students joined the Inn for every student called to the Bar, but by 1713 the ratio had become 2.3 new members to every 1 call.

Over a 50-year period, the Civil War and high taxation under William III economically crippled many members of the gentry, meaning that they could not afford to allow their sons to study at the Inns. David Lemmings considers it to have been more serious than that, for two reasons; firstly, Inner Temple and Middle Temple had actually shown an increase in membership following the Restoration, and secondly because Gray&#x27;s Inn had previously had far more &quot;common&quot; members than the other Inns. The decrease in the number of gentry at the Inn could therefore not completely explain the large drop in members.

Gray&#x27;s Inn was the venue for an early cricket match in July 1730 between London and Kent. The original source reports &quot;a cricket-match between the Kentish men and the Londoners for £50, and won by the former&quot;, giving the precise location as &quot;a field near the lower end of Gray&#x27;s Inn Lane, London&quot;.

In 1733 the requirements for a call to the Bar were significantly revised in a joint meeting between the Benchers of Inner Temple and Gray&#x27;s Inn, revisions accepted by Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and Middle Temple, although they were not represented. It is not recorded what these changes were, but after a further discussion in 1762 the Inns adopted a rule that any student with a Master of Arts or Bachelor of Laws degree from the universities of Oxford or Cambridge could be called to the Bar after three years as a student, and any other student could be called after five years. An attempt was made to increase the quality of legal education at Gray&#x27;s Inn; in 1753 a barrister, Danby Pickering, was employed to lecture there, although this agreement ended in 1761 when he was called to the Bar.

The 18th century was not a particularly prosperous time for the Inn or its members, and few notable barristers were members during this period. Some noted members include Sir Thomas Clarke, the Master of the Rolls, Sir James Eyre, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Samuel Romilly, a noted law reformer. In 1780 the Inn was involved in the case of &quot;R v the Benchers of Gray&#x27;s Inn&quot;, a test of the role of the Inns of Court as the sole authority to call students to the Bar. The case was brought to the Court of King&#x27;s Bench by William Hart, a student at the Inn, who asked the court (under Lord Mansfield) to order the Inn to call him to the Bar. Mansfield ruled that the Inns of Court were indeed the only organisations able to call students to the Bar, and refused to order the Inns to call Hart.

During the 19th century, the Inns began to stagnate; little had been changed since the 17th century in terms of legal education or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to the Bar was introduced. Gray&#x27;s Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to the Bar at the Inn transferred to others.

Gray&#x27;s Inn was the smallest of the Inns during the early 20th century, and was noted for its connection to the Northern Circuit. During a 1918 Allied World War I conference it would be the site where Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, the future leaders of the Western Allies in World War II, would first meet. 

Following the passage of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act in December 1919, women could be admitted to the Inns of Court. The first three women were admitted in 1920. Mary Selina Share Jones (1874–1954) was admitted on 27 Jan 1920 following a law degree from the University of Liverpool but was not called, going on to qualify as a medical doctor instead. Edith Hesling (1899–1971) was admitted on 4 October 1920 while studying for a law degree at the University of Manchester. On 13 June 1923 she became the first woman called to the Bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn. (Mary) Robina Stevens (1903–51) was admitted on 8 October 1920 whilst studying at London University. She was called on 28 January 1924.

During World War II the Inn was badly damaged during the Blitz in 1941, with the Hall, the chapel, the Library and many other buildings hit and almost destroyed. The rebuilding of much of the Inn took until 1960 by the architect Sir Edward Maufe. In 2008 Gray&#x27;s Inn became the first Inn to appoint &quot;fellows&quot;—elected businesspeople, legal academics and others—with the intent of giving them a wider perspective and education than the other Inns would offer.

==Structure and governance==
Gray&#x27;s Inn&#x27;s internal records date from 1569, at which point there were four types of member; those who had not yet been called to the Bar, Utter Barristers, Ancients and Readers. Utter Barristers were those who had been called to the Bar but were still studying, Ancients were those who were called to the Bar and were allowed to practise and Readers were those who had been called to the Bar, were allowed to practise and now played a part in educating law students at the Inns of Chancery and at Gray&#x27;s Inn itself. At the time Gray&#x27;s Inn was the odd one out amongst the Inns; the others did not recognise Ancients as a degree of barrister and had Benchers roughly corresponding to the Readers used at Gray&#x27;s Inn (although the positions were not identical).

The Inn is run by Pension, its ultimate governing body. The name is peculiar to Gray&#x27;s Inn—at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn the governing body is called the council, and at the Inner and Middle Temples it is called the Parliament. The name was used for the governing bodies of three of the Inns of Chancery—Barnard&#x27;s Inn, Clement&#x27;s Inn and New Inn. In Gray&#x27;s Inn the Readers, when they existed, were required to attend Pension meetings, and other barristers were at one point welcome to, although only the Readers would be allowed to speak. Pension at Gray&#x27;s Inn is made up of the Masters of the Bench, and the Inn as a whole is headed by the Treasurer, a senior Bencher. The Treasurer has always been elected, and since 1744 the office has rotated between individuals, with a term of one year.

===Readers===
A Reader was a person literally elected to read—he would be elected to the Pension (council) of Gray&#x27;s Inn, and would take his place by giving a &quot;reading&quot;, or lecture, on a particular legal topic. Two readers would be elected annually by Pension to serve a one-year term. Initially (before the rise of the Benchers) the Readers were the governing body of Gray&#x27;s Inn, and formed Pension. The earliest certain records of Readers are from the 16th century—although the Inn&#x27;s records only start at 1569 William Dugdale (himself a member) published a list in his &quot;Origines Juridiciales&quot; dating from 1514. S.E. Thorne published a list dating from 1430, but this is entirely conjectural and not based on any official records, only reports of &quot;readings&quot; that took place at Gray&#x27;s Inn. By 1569 there had certainly been Readers for more than a century.

The English Civil War marked the end of legal education at the Inns, and the class of Readers went into decline. The last Readers were appointed in 1677, and the position of the Readers as heads of the Inn and members of Pension was taken by the Benchers.

===Benchers===

A Bencher, Benchsitter or (formally) Master of the Bench is a member of Pension, the governing body of the Honourable Society of Gray&#x27;s Inn. The term originally referred to one who sat on the benches in the main hall of the Inn which were used for dining and during moots, and the term originally had no significance. The position of Bencher developed during the 16th century when the Readers, for unknown reasons, decided that some barristers who were not Readers should be afforded the same rights and privileges as those who were, although without a voice in Pension. This was a rare practice and occurred a total of seven times within the 16th century, the first being Robert Flynt in 1549. The next was Nicholas Bacon in 1550, then Edward Stanhope in 1580, who was afforded the privilege because, although a skilled attorney, an illness meant he could never fulfil the duties of a Reader.

The practice became more common during the 17th century—11 people were made Benchers between 1600 and 1630—and in 1614 one of the Benchers appointed was explicitly allowed to be a member of Pension. This became more common, creating a two-rank system in which both Readers and Benchers were members of Pension. However far more Readers were appointed than Benchers—50 between 1600 and 1630—and it appeared that Readers would remain the higher rank despite this change.

The outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642 marked the end of legal education at the Inns, although Parliament attempted to persuade Readers to continue by threatening them with fines. The class of Readers went into decline and Benchers were called as members of Pension instead. In 1679 there was the first mass-call of Benchers (22 on one occasion, and 15 on another), with the Benchers paying a fine of 100 marks because they refused to read, and modern Benchers pay a &quot;fine&quot; in a continuation of this tradition.

Noted Benchers of Gray&#x27;s Inn include Lord Birkenhead and Francis Bacon. Honorary Benchers can also be appointed, although they have no role in Pension, such as Lord Denning, who was appointed in 1979, and Winston Churchill. Today there are over 300 Benchers in Gray&#x27;s Inn, mostly senior barristers and members of the judiciary.

===Badge===

Gray&#x27;s Inn does not possess a coat of arms &quot;per se&quot; but instead uses a heraldic badge, which is often displayed on a shield. It is blazoned either &quot;Azure an Indian Griffin proper segreant&quot; or, more currently, &quot;Sable a griffin segreant or&quot;, i.e., a gold griffin on a black background. The Inn originally used a variant of the coat of arms of the Grey family, but this was changed to the griffin at some time around the 1590s. There is no record of why this was done, but it is possible that the new emblem was adapted from the arms of the Treasurer Richard Aungier (d. 1597).

The Inn&#x27;s motto, the date of adoption of which is unknown, is &quot;Integra Lex Aequi Custos Rectique Magistra Non Habet Affectus Sed Causas Gubernat&quot;, which is Latin for &#x27;Impartial justice, guardian of equity, mistress of the law, without fear or favour rules men&#x27;s causes aright&#x27;. The seal of Gray&#x27;s Inn consists of the badge encircled by the motto.

==Buildings and gardens==
The Inn is located at the intersection of High Holborn and Gray&#x27;s Inn Road. It started as a single manor house with a hall and chapel, although an additional wing had been added by the date of the &quot;Woodcut&quot; map of London, drawn probably in the early 1560s. Expansion continued over the following decades, and by 1586 the Pension had added another two wings around the central court. Around these were several sets of barristers&#x27; chambers erected by members of the Inn under a leasehold agreement whereby ownership of the buildings would revert to the Inn at the end of the lease.

As the Inn grew it became necessary (for safety purposes) to wall off the land owned by the Inn, which had previously been open to everyone. In 1591 the &quot;back field&quot; was walled off, but little more was done until 1608, when under the supervision of Francis Bacon, the Treasurer, more construction work was undertaken, particularly in walling off and improving the gardens and walks. In 1629 it was ordered that an architect supervise any construction and ensure that the new buildings were architecturally similar to the old ones, and the strict enforcement of this rule during the 18th century is given as a reason for the uniformity of the buildings at Gray&#x27;s Inn.

During the late 17th century many buildings were demolished, either because of poor repair or to standardise and modernise the buildings at the Inn. Many more were built over the open land surrounding the Inn, although this was controversial at the time; in November 1672 the Privy Council and Charles II himself were petitioned to order that nothing should be built on the open land, and a similar request was sent to the Lord Chancellor in May 1673. From 1672 to 1674 additional buildings were constructed in the Red Lyon Fields by Nicholas Barebone, and members of the Inn attempted to sue him to prevent this. After the lawsuits failed members of the Inn were seen to fight with Barebones&#x27; workmen, &quot;wherein several were shrewdly hurt&quot;.

In February 1679 a fire broke out on the west side of Coney Court, necessitating the rebuilding of the entire row. Another fire broke out in January 1684 in Coney Court, destroying several buildings including the Library. A third fire in 1687 destroyed a large part of Holborn Court, and when the buildings were rebuilt after these fires they were constructed of brick to be more resistant to fire than the wood and plaster previously used in construction. As a result, the domestic Tudor style architecture which had dominated much of the Inn was replaced with more modern styles. Records show that prior to the rebuilding in 1687, the Inn had been &quot;so incommodious&quot; that the &quot;ancients&quot; were forced to work two to a chamber. More of the Inn was rebuilt during that period, and between 1669 and 1774 all of the Inn apart from parts of the Hall and Chapel had been rebuilt.

More buildings were constructed during the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1941 the Inn suffered under The Blitz, which damaged or destroyed much of the Inn, necessitating the repair of many buildings and the construction of more. Today many buildings are let as professional offices for barristers and solicitors with between and of office space available. There are also approximately 60 residential apartments, rented out to barristers who are members of the Inn. The Inn also contains the Inns of Court School of Law, a joint educational venture between all four Inns of Court where the vocational training for barristers and solicitors is undertaken. The current Inn layout consists of two squares—South Square and Gray&#x27;s Inn Square—with the remaining buildings arranged around the Walks.

===Hall===

The Hall was part of the original Manor of Portpoole, although it was significantly rebuilt during the reign of Mary I, and again during the reign of Elizabeth, with the rebuilding being finished on 10 November 1559. The rebuilt Hall measured in length, in width and in height, and remains about the same size today. It has a hammerbeam roof and a raised dais at one end with a grand table on it, where the Benchers and other notables would originally have sat.

The hall also contains a large carved screen at one end covering the entrance to the Vestibule. Legend says that the screen was given to the Inn by Elizabeth I while she was the Inn&#x27;s patron, and is carved out of the wood of a Spanish galleon captured from the Spanish Armada. The Hall was lit with the aid of massive windows filled with the Coats of Arms of those members who became Treasurers. The Benchers&#x27; table is also said to have been a gift from Elizabeth, and as a result the only public toast in the Inn until the late 19th century was &quot;to the glorious, pious and immortal memory of Queen Elizabeth&quot;.

The walls of the Hall are decorated with paintings of noted patrons or members of the Inn, including Nicholas Bacon and Elizabeth I. During the Second World War the Hall was one of those buildings badly damaged during the Blitz. The Treasurers&#x27; Arms and paintings had been moved to a place of safety and were not damaged; during the rebuilding after the War they were put back in the Hall, where they remain. The rebuilt hall was designed by Edward Maufe, and was formally opened in 1951 by the Duke of Gloucester.

===Chapel===
The Chapel existed in the original manor house used by the Inn, and dates from 1315. In 1625 it was enlarged under the supervision of Eubule Thelwall, but by 1698 it was &quot;very ruinous&quot;, and had to be rebuilt. Little is known of the changes, except that the barristers&#x27; chambers above the chapel were removed. The building was again rebuilt in 1893, and remained that way until its destruction during The Blitz in 1941. The chapel was finally rebuilt in 1960, and the original stained glass windows (which had been removed and taken to a safe location) were restored. The rebuilt Chapel contains &quot;simple furnishings&quot; made of Canadian maple donated by the Canadian Bar Association.

The Inn has had a Chaplain since at least 1400, where a court case is recorded as being brought by the &quot;Chaplain of Greyes Inn&quot;. During the 16th century the Inn began hiring full-time preachers to staff the Chapel—the first, John Cherke, was appointed in 1576. A radical Puritan in a time of religious conflict, Cherke held his post for only a short time before being replaced by a Thomas Crooke in 1580. After Crooke&#x27;s death in 1598 Roger Fenton served as preacher, until his replacement by Richard Sibbes, later Master of Catherine Hall, Cambridge, in 1616. Gray&#x27;s Inn still employs a Preacher; Michael Doe, former Bishop of Swindon and more recently General Secretary of the United Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, was appointed in 2011. The East window is by George Ostrehan.

===Walks===

The Walks are the gardens within Gray&#x27;s Inn, and have existed since at least 1597, when records show that Francis Bacon was to be paid £7 for &quot;planting of trees in the walkes&quot;. Prior to this the area (known as Green Court) was used as a place to dump waste and rubble, since at the time the Inn was open to any Londoner. In 1587 four Benchers were ordered by the Pension to &quot;consider what charge a brick wall in the fields will draw unto And where the said wall shalbe fittest to be builded&quot;, and work on such a wall was completed in 1598, which helped keep out the citizens of London.

In 1599 additional trees were planted in the Walks, and stairs up to the Walks were also added. When Francis Bacon became treasurer in 1608 more improvements were made, since he no longer had to seek the approval of the Pension to make changes. In September 1608 a gate was installed on the southern wall, and various gardeners were employed to maintain the Walks. The gardens became commonly used as a place of relaxation, and James Howell wrote in 1621 that &quot;I hold [Gray&#x27;s Inn Walks] to be the pleasantest place about London, and that there you have the choicest society&quot;.

The Walks were well-maintained during the reign of William III, although the Inn&#x27;s lack of prosperity made more improvements impossible. In 1711 the gardener was ordered not to admit &quot;any women or children into the Walkes&quot;, and in 1718 was given permission to physically remove those he found. At the end of the 18th century Charles Lamb said that the Walks were &quot;the best gardens of any of the Inns of Court, their aspect being altogether reverend and law-abiding&quot;. In 1720 the old gate was replaced by &quot;a pair of handsome iron gates with peers and other proper imbellishments&quot;. The 19th and 20th centuries saw few major changes, apart from the introduction of plane trees into the Walks.

The Walks are listed Grade II*on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

===Library===
The Library of Gray&#x27;s Inn has existed since at least 1555, when the first mention of it was made in the will of Robert Chaloner, who left some money to buy law books for the Library. The Library was neither a big collection nor a dedicated one; in 1568 it was being housed in a single room in the chambers of Nicholas Bacon, a room that was also used for mooting and to store the deed chest. The collection grew larger over the years as individual Benchers such as Sir John Finch and Sir John Bankes left books or money to buy books in their wills, and the first Librarian was appointed in 1646 after members of the Inn had been found stealing books.

In 1669 books were bought by the Inn as an organisation for the first time, and a proper catalogue was drawn up to prevent theft. In 1684 a fire that broke out in Coney Court, where the Library was situated, and destroyed much of the collection. While some books were saved, most of the records prior to 1684 were lost. A &quot;handsome room&quot; was then built to house the Library.

The Library became more important during the 18th century; prior to that it had been a small, little-used collection of books. In 1725 it was proposed by the Pension that &quot;a publick Library be sett up and kept open for ye use of ye society&quot;, and that more books be purchased. The first order of new books was on 27 June 1729 and consisted of &quot;a collection of Lord Bacon&#x27;s works&quot;. In 1750 the Under-Steward of the Inn made a new catalogue of the books, and in 1789 the Library was moved to a new room between the Hall and the chapel. In 1840 another two rooms were erected in which to store books, and in 1883 a new Library was constructed with space to store approximately 11,000 books. This was rapidly found to be inadequate, and in 1929 a new Library, known as the Holker Library after the benefactor, Sir John Holker, was opened. The library, although impressive looking, was not particularly useful. Francis Cowper wrote that:
Though impressive to look at, the new building was something less than a success as a library. The air of spaciousness was produced at the expense of shelf room, and though in the octagon [at the north end] the decorative effect of row upon row of books soaring upwards towards the cornice was considerable, the loftiest were totally inaccessible save to those who could scale the longest and dizziest ladders. Further, the appointments were of such surpassing magnificence that no ink-pots were allowed in the room for fear of accidents.

The building did not last very long—damage to the Inn during the Blitz completely destroyed the Library and a large part of its collection, although the rare manuscripts, which had been moved elsewhere, survived. After the destruction of much of the Inn&#x27;s collection, George VI donated replacements for many lost texts. A prefabricated building in the Walks was used to hold the surviving books while a new Library was constructed, and the new building (designed by Sir Edward Maufe) was opened in 1958. It is similar in size to the old Holker Library, but is more workmanlike and designed to allow for easy access to the books.

==Notable members==

Having existed for over 600 years, Gray&#x27;s Inn has a long list of notable members and honorary members. Names of many members can be found in the List of members of Gray&#x27;s Inn. Even as the smallest of the Inns of Court it has had members who have been particularly noted lawyers and judges, such as Francis Bacon, The 1st Earl of Birkenhead, Baron Slynn, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Hoffmann and Baroness Hale of Richmond, the first female Justice of the Supreme Court. Outside the Bar and judiciary of England and Wales, members have included the clergy (including five Archbishops of Canterbury), industrialists like John Wynne, astronomers such as John Lee, media figures, like Huw Thomas, and members of the Bar, judiciary and Government of other nations, such as Sir Ti-liang Yang (former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong), B. R. Ambedkar (principal architect of the Constitution of India), Leslie Goonewardene (founder of Sri Lanka&#x27;s first political party, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party), former presidents of Cyprus Spyros Kyprianou, Tassos Papadopoulos, and Glafcos Clerides, and Prime Minister-designate of Trinidad and Tobago Stuart Young.

<text>Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) is a herring in the family Clupeidae. It is one of the most abundant fish species in the world. Atlantic herrings can be found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, congregating in large schools. They can grow up to in length and weigh up to . They feed on copepods, krill and small fish, while their natural predators are seals, whales, cod and other larger fish.

The Atlantic herring fishery has long been an important part of the economy of New England and the Atlantic provinces of Canada. This is because the fish congregate relatively near to the coast in massive schools, notably in the cold waters of the semi-enclosed Gulf of Maine and Gulf of St. Lawrence. North Atlantic herring schools have been measured up to in size, containing an estimated four billion fish.

==Description==
Atlantic herring have a body. Gill rakers in their mouths filter incoming water, trapping any zooplankton and phytoplankton.

Atlantic herring are in general fragile. They have large and delicate gill surfaces, and contact with foreign matter can strip away their large scales.

They have retreated from many estuaries worldwide due to excess water pollution although in some estuaries that have been cleaned up, herring have returned. The presence of their larvae indicates cleaner and more–oxygenated waters.

==Range and habitat==
Atlantic herring can be found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. They range, shoaling and schooling, across North Atlantic waters such as the Gulf of Maine, the Gulf of St Lawrence, the Bay of Fundy, the Labrador Sea, the Davis Straits, the Beaufort Sea, the Denmark Strait, the Norwegian Sea, the North Sea, the Skagerrak, the English Channel, the Celtic Sea, the Irish Sea, the Bay of Biscay and Sea of the Hebrides. Although Atlantic herring are found in the northern waters surrounding the Arctic, they are not considered to be an Arctic species.

==Baltic herring==

The small-sized herring in the inner parts of the Baltic Sea, which is also less fatty than the true Atlantic herring (&quot;Clupea harengus harengus&quot;), is considered a distinct subspecies, &quot;Baltic herring&quot; (&quot;Clupea harengus membras&quot;), despite the lack of a distinctive genome. The Baltic herring has a specific name in many local languages (Swedish &quot;strömming&quot;, Finnish &quot;silakka&quot;, Estonian &quot;räim&quot;, &quot;silk&quot;, Livonian &quot;siļk&quot;, Russian салака, Polish &quot;śledź bałtycki&quot;, Latvian &quot;reņģes&quot;, Lithuanian s&quot;trimelė&quot;) and is popularly and in cuisine considered distinct from herring. For example, the Swedish dish surströmming is made from Baltic herring.

Fisheries for Baltic herring have been at unsustainable levels since the Middle Ages. Around this time, the primary Baltic herring catch consisted of an autumn-spawning population. Cooling in the mid-16th century related to the Little Ice Age, combined with this overfishing, led to a dramatic loss of productivity in the population of autumn-spawning herring that rendered it nearly extinct. Due to this, the autumn-spawning herring were largely replaced by a spring-spawning population, which has since comprised most of the Baltic herring fisheries; this population is also at risk of overfishing.

== Life cycle ==
Herrings reach sexual maturity when they are 3 to 5 years old. The life expectancy once mature is 12 to 16 years. Atlantic herring may have different spawning components within a single stock which spawn during different seasons. They spawn in estuaries, coastal waters or in offshore banks. Fertilization is external, as in most other fish: the female releases between 20,000 and 40,000 eggs and the males simultaneously release masses of milt so that they mix freely in the sea. Once fertilized the 1 to 1.4 mm diameter eggs sink to the sea bed where their sticky surface adheres to gravel or weed. They mature in 1–3 weeks; in 14–19 °C water it takes 6–8 days, in 7,5 °C it takes 17 days. They will only mature if the water temperature stays below 19 °C. The hatched larvae are 3 to 4 mm long and transparent except for the eyes which have some pigmentation.

== Population ==
Herrings are most seen in the North Atlantic Ocean, from the coast of South Carolina until Greenland, and from the Baltic Sea until Novaya Zemlya. In the North Sea people can distinguish four different main populations spawning in different periods:

* The Buchan-Shetland herrings spawn in August and September near the Scottish and Shetland coasts.
* On the Dogger Bank herrings spawn from August until October. 
* The more southern population will spawn later, from November until January. These are the herrings from the Southern Bight of Downs.
* The Soused herring spawns every spring in the Baltic Sea, and travels via Skagerrak to the North Sea.

These four populations live outside of the spawn season interchangeably. In their spawn season, each population gathers together on their own spawn grounds.

In the past, there was another, fifth distinct population, the Zuiderzee herring, which spawned in the former Zuiderzee. This population disappeared when the Zuiderzee was drained by the Dutch as part of the larger Zuiderzee Works.

==Ecology==
Herring-like fish are the most important fish group on the planet. They are also the most populous fish. They are the dominant converter of zooplankton into fish, consuming copepods, arrow worms chaetognatha, pelagic amphipods hyperiidae, mysids and krill in the pelagic zone. Conversely, they are a central prey item or forage fish for higher trophic levels. The reasons for this success are still enigmatic; one speculation attributes their dominance to the huge, extremely fast cruising schools they inhabit.

Orca, cod, dolphins, porpoises, sharks, rockfish, seabirds, whales, squid, sea lions, seals, tuna, salmon, and fishermen are among the predators of these fishes.

Herring&#x27;s pelagic–prey includes copepods (e.g. Centropagidae, &quot;Calanus&quot; spp., &quot;Acartia&quot; spp., &quot;Temora&quot; spp.), amphipods like &quot;Hyperia&quot; spp., larval snails, diatoms by larvae below , peridinians, molluscan larvae, fish eggs, krill like &quot;Meganyctiphanes norvegica&quot;, mysids, small fishes, menhaden larvae, pteropods, annelids, tintinnids by larvae below , Haplosphaera, &quot;Pseudocalanus&quot;.

==Schooling==

Atlantic herring can school in immense numbers. Radakov estimated herring schools in the North Atlantic can occupy up to 4.8 cubic kilometres with fish densities between 0.5 and 1.0 fish/cubic metre, equivalent to several million fish in one school.

Herring are amongst the most spectacular schoolers (&quot;obligate schoolers&quot; under older terminology). They aggregate in groups that consist of thousands to hundreds of thousands or even millions of individuals. The schools traverse the open oceans.

Schools have a very precise spatial arrangement that allows the school to maintain a relatively constant cruising speed. Schools from an individual stock generally travel in a triangular pattern between their spawning grounds, e.g. Southern Norway, their feeding grounds (Iceland) and their nursery grounds (Northern Norway). Such wide triangular journeys are probably important because feeding herrings cannot distinguish their own offspring. They have excellent hearing, and a school can react very quickly to evade predators. Herring schools keep a certain distance from a moving scuba diver or a cruising predator like a killer whale, forming a vacuole which looks like a doughnut from a spotter plane. The phenomenon of schooling is far from understood, especially the implications on swimming and feeding-energetics. Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain the function of schooling, such as predator confusion, reduced risk of being found, better orientation, and synchronized hunting. However, schooling has disadvantages such as: oxygen- and food-depletion and excretion buildup in the breathing media. The school-array probably gives advantages in energy saving although this is a highly controversial and much debated field.

Schools of herring can on calm days sometimes be detected at the surface from more than a mile away by the little waves they form, or from a few meters at night when they trigger bioluminescence in surrounding plankton (&quot;firing&quot;). All underwater recordings show herring constantly cruising reaching speeds up to per second, and much higher escape speeds.

==Relationship with humans==
===Fisheries===
The Atlantic herring fishery is managed by multiple organizations that work together on the rules and regulations applying to herring. As of 2010 the species was not threatened by overfishing.

They are an important bait fish for recreational fishermen.

===Aquariums===
Because of their feeding habits, cruising desire, collective behavior and fragility they survive in very few aquaria worldwide despite their abundance in the ocean. Even the best facilities leave them slim and slow compared to healthy wild schools.

<doc id="207897" wikidata="Q835016" url="?curid=207897" title="Window (computing)">
<text>In computing, a window is a graphical control element. It consists of a visual area containing some of the graphical user interface of the program it belongs to and is framed by a window decoration. It usually has a rectangular shape that can overlap with the area of other windows. It displays the &quot;output&quot; of and may allow &quot;input&quot; to one or more processes.

Windows are primarily associated with graphical displays, where they can be manipulated with a pointer by employing some kind of pointing device. Text-only displays can also support windowing, as a way to maintain multiple independent display areas, such as multiple buffers in Emacs. Text windows are usually controlled by keyboard, though some also respond to the mouse.

A graphical user interface (GUI) using windows as one of its main &quot;metaphors&quot; is called a windowing system, whose main components are the display server and the window manager.

==History==
The idea was developed at the Stanford Research Institute (led by Douglas Engelbart). Their earliest systems supported multiple windows, but there was no obvious way to indicate boundaries between them (such as window borders, title bars, etc.).

Research continued at Xerox Corporation&#x27;s Palo Alto Research Center / PARC (led by Alan Kay). They used overlapping windows.

During the 1980s the term &quot;WIMP&quot;, which stands for window, icon, menu, pointer, was coined at PARC.

Apple had worked with PARC briefly at that time. Apple developed an interface based on PARC&#x27;s interface. It was first used on Apple&#x27;s Lisa and later Macintosh computers. Microsoft was developing Office applications for the Mac at that time. Some speculate that this gave them access to Apple&#x27;s OS before it was released and thus influenced the design of the windowing system in what would eventually be called Microsoft Windows.

==Properties==
Windows are two dimensional objects arranged on a plane called the desktop metaphor. In a modern full-featured windowing system they can be resized, moved, hidden, restored or closed.

Windows usually include other graphical objects, possibly including a menu-bar, toolbars, controls, icons and often a working area. In the working area, the document, image, folder contents or other main object is displayed. Around the working area, within the bounding window, there may be other smaller window areas, sometimes called panes or panels, showing relevant information or options. The working area of a single document interface holds only one main object. &quot;Child windows&quot; in multiple document interfaces, and tabs for example in many web browsers, can make several similar documents or main objects available within a single main application window. Some windows in macOS have a feature called a drawer, which is a pane that slides out the side of the window and to show extra options.

Applications that can run either under a graphical user interface or in a text user interface may use different terminology. GNU Emacs uses the term &quot;window&quot; to refer to an area within its display while a traditional window, such as controlled by an X11 window manager, is called a &quot;frame&quot;.

Any window can be split into the window decoration and the window&#x27;s content, although some systems purposely eschew window decoration as a form of minimalism.

==Window decoration==
The window decoration is a part of a window in most windowing systems.

Window decoration typically consists of a title bar, usually along the top of each window and a minimal border around the other three sides. On Microsoft Windows this is called &quot;non-client area&quot;.

In the predominant layout for modern window decorations, the top bar contains the title of that window and buttons which perform windowing-related actions such as:
* Close
* Maximize
* Minimize
* Resize
* Roll-up

The border exists primarily to allow the user to resize the window, but also to create a visual separation between the window&#x27;s contents and the rest of the desktop environment.

Window decorations are considered important for the design of the look and feel of an operating system and some systems allow for customization of the colors, styles and animation effects used.

=== Window border ===

Window border is a window decoration component provided by some window managers, that appears around the active window. Some window managers may also display a border around background windows. Typically window borders enable the window to be resized or moved by dragging the border. Some window managers provide useless borders which are purely for decorative purposes and offer no window motion facility. These window managers do not allow windows to be resized by using a drag action on the border.

=== Title bar ===
The title bar is a graphical control element and part of the window decoration provided by some window managers. As a convention, it is located at the top of the window as a horizontal bar. The title bar is typically used to display the name of the application or the name of the open document, and may provide title bar buttons for minimizing, maximizing, closing or rolling up of application windows. These functions are typically placed in the top-right of the screen to allow fast and inaccurate inputs through barrier pointing. Typically title bars can be used to provide window motion enabling the window to be moved around the screen by grabbing the title bar and dragging it. Some window managers provide title bars which are purely for decorative purposes and offer no window motion facility. These window managers do not allow windows to be moved around the screen by using a drag action on the title bar.

Default title-bar text often incorporates the name of the application and/or of its developer. The name of the host running the application also appears frequently. Various methods (menu-selections, escape sequences, setup parameters, command-line options – depending on the computing environment) may exist to give the end-user some control of title-bar text. Document-oriented applications like a text editor may display the filename or path of the document being edited. Most web browsers will render the contents of the HTML element codice_1 in their title bar, sometimes pre- or postfixed by the application name. Google Chrome and some versions of Mozilla Firefox place their tabs in the title bar. This makes it unnecessary to use the main window for the tabs, but usually results in the title becoming truncated. An asterisk at its beginning may be used to signify unsaved changes.

The title bar often contains widgets for system commands relating to the window, such as a &quot;maximize&quot;, &quot;minimize&quot;, &quot;rollup&quot; and &quot;close&quot; buttons; and may include other content such as an application icon, a clock, etc.

====Title bar buttons====
Some window managers provide title bar buttons which provide the facility to minimize, maximize, roll-up or close application windows. Some window managers may display the title bar buttons in the task bar or task panel, rather than in the title bars.

The following buttons may appear in the title bar:
* Close
* Maximize
* Minimize
* Resize
* Roll-up (or WindowShade)

Note that a context menu may be available from some title bar buttons or by right-clicking.

==== Title bar icon ====
Some window managers display a small icon in the title bar that may vary according to the application on which it appears. The title bar icon may behave like a menu button, or may provide a context menu facility. macOS applications commonly have a proxy icon next to the window title that functions the same as the document&#x27;s icon in the file manager.

==== Document status icon ====
Some window managers display an icon or symbol to indicate that the contents of the window have not been saved or confirmed in some way: macOS displays a dot in the center of its close button; RISC OS appends an asterisk to the title.

==== Tiling window managers ====
Some tiling window managers provide title bars which are purely for informative purposes and offer no controls or menus. These window managers do not allow windows to be moved around the screen by using a drag action on the title bar and may also serve the purpose of a status line from stacking window managers.

<text>Eobaataridae is a family of fossil mammals within the order Multituberculata. Remains are known from the Lower Cretaceous of Europe and Asia. They are among the most derived representatives of the informal suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot;, and closely related to Cimolodonta. Most eobaatarids are only known from isolated teeth, though several reasonably complete members are known, including &quot;Sinobaatar&quot; and &quot;Jeholbaatar&quot;. The body of &quot;Sinobaatar&quot; is generalised, while &quot;Jeholbaatar&quot; displays clear adaptations for scansoriality (climbing) due to its elongated digits. Due to the morphology of the cheek teeth, &quot;Eobaatar&quot; and &quot;Jeholbaatar&quot; are inferred to be omnivorous, likely feeding on plants and invertebrates.

&quot;Indobaatar&quot; from the Early Jurassic Kota Formation has been suggested to be the earliest known multituberculate, let alone the earliest eobaatarid, and may stretch the eobaatarid-cimolodontan group much earlier than previously thought. However its referral to the family has been considered questionable by other scholars.

Fossils of &quot;Jeholbaatar kielanae&quot; seem to show that multituberculates independently acquired a middle ear from other mammal groups.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Eobaatar&quot; (from ancient Greek &quot;ἠώς&quot;= dawn and Mongolian &quot;baatar&quot;= hero) means &quot;dawn hero&quot;.

<text>Bong Load Records is an independent record label originally based in Los Angeles which was founded by producers Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf and partner Bradshaw Lambert.

Much of the Bong Load Records catalog is released in small quantities. Several bands have very rare releases that are much sought after and command high prices at auctions.

Bong Load Records relaunched on its 25th anniversary in 2016 with limited edition vinyl releases. Tom Rothrock sums up the label &quot;Our core philosophy of the indie label was always about making high quality music with artists who have dedicated their lives to their craft – artists who otherwise might not have been heard.&quot;

== History ==

One of Bong Load Records&#x27; biggest signings was Beck in 1991. Beck&#x27;s &quot;Loser&quot; single became the first number one, non-major label single since FM radio became mainstream. In 1998, Beck recorded the album &quot;Mutations&quot; intended for release on Bong Load Records but it was eventually released on the Geffen label. There were a series of lawsuits between Beck, Bong Load and Geffen, settled in 1999, which led to Beck&#x27;s renegotiation with Geffen. Beck released multiple titles on Bong Load including &quot;Loser&quot;, &quot;Mellow Gold&quot;, &quot;Odelay&quot;, &quot;Mutations&quot; and &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot;.

Other notable bands from the original Bong Load Custom Records include Wool, Kyuss, The Obsessed, Fatso Jetson, Elliott Smith, Eels, L7, R.L. Burnside and Lutefisk. Stoner rock band Fu Manchu released their first two albums via Bong Load Records.

In 2007, Rothrock briefly relaunched the label with a series of releases, including his own instrumental album &quot;Resonator&quot;.

In July 2016, Bong Load Records announced a relaunch of the label, now based in Las Vegas, with 7 limited edition vinyl releases: The Killers (&quot;Sam’s Town&quot; - 10th Anniversary reissue), Mark Stoermer (&quot;Dark Arts&quot;), Masters of Reality (&quot;Deep In The Hole&quot; - 15th Anniversary reissue - features Chris Goss and guests Mark Lanegan, Josh Homme and members of Queens of the Stone Age and Kyuss) Elliott Smith (&quot;Figure 8&quot;, &quot;XO&quot;) and Beck (&quot;Odelay&quot; (20th Anniversary reissue), &quot;Mellow Gold&quot;).

<text>Tinamous () are members of the order Tinamiformes (), and family Tinamidae (), divided into two distinct subfamilies, containing 46 species found in Mexico, Central America, and South America. The word &quot;tinamou&quot; comes from the Galibi term for these birds, &quot;tinamu&quot;. Tinamous are the only living group of palaeognaths able to fly, and were traditionally regarded as the sister group of the flightless ratites, but recent work places them well within the ratite radiation as most closely related to the extinct moa of New Zealand, implying flightlessness emerged among ratites multiple times. Tinamous first appear in the fossil record in the Miocene epoch. They are generally sedentary, ground-dwelling and, though not flightless, when possible avoid flight in favour of hiding or running away from danger. They are found in a variety of habitats, ranging from semi-arid alpine grasslands to tropical rainforests. The two subfamilies are broadly divided by habitat, with the Nothurinae referred to as steppe or open country tinamous, and the Tinaminae known as forest tinamous.

Although some species are quite common, tinamous are shy and secretive birds. They are active during the day, retiring to roosts at night. They generally have cryptic plumage, with males and females similar in appearance, though the females are usually larger. They are opportunistic and omnivorous feeders, consuming a wide variety of plant and animal food from fruits and seeds to worms, insects and small vertebrates. They will dust-bathe as well as wash themselves by standing in heavy rain. They are heard more often than seen, communicating with each other by a variety of frequently given, characteristic calls, especially during the breeding season.

With occasional exceptions, a male tinamou maintains a territory and a nesting site during the breeding season which a succession of females will visit, laying their eggs in the same nest. Females will wander through several territories mating with, and laying eggs in the nests of, the resident males. Nests are always on the ground, concealed in vegetation or among rocks. Eggs are relatively large and glossy, often brightly colored when laid, and are incubated by the males for a period of two to three weeks. The chicks can run soon after hatching and are largely self-sufficient at three weeks old.

Tinamous and their eggs have many natural predators, from falcons and vampire bats to jaguars. They have also been extensively hunted by humans and sometimes persecuted as agricultural pests. However, the main threat to their populations is from habitat destruction through land clearing and agricultural development. Seven species are listed as vulnerable and another seven as near-threatened. They feature in the mythology of the indigenous peoples of their range. Often translocated and easily bred in captivity, they have never been successfully domesticated.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The tinamou family consists of 46 extant species in nine genera. The two subfamilies are the Nothurinae (also known as the Rhyncotinae), the steppe tinamous, and the Tinaminae, the forest tinamous. &quot;&quot;Tinamidae&quot; was defined as by Gauthier and de Queiroz (2001): &quot;Tinamidae&quot; refers to the crown clade stemming from the most recent common ancestor of &quot;Tetrao&quot; [&quot;Tinamus&quot;] &quot;major&quot; Gmelin 1789 and all extant birds sharing a more recent ancestor with that species than with &quot;Struthio camelus&quot; Linnaeus 1758 and &quot;Vultur gryphus&quot; Linnaeus 1758.&quot; Their similarity to other ground-dwelling birds such as partridges and megapodes is a result of convergence and symplesiomorphy rather than shared evolutionary innovations.

Of Gondwanan origin, tinamous are allied to the flightless ratites, together comprising the Palaeognathae (&quot;old jaws&quot;), while all other living birds are members of Neognathae (&quot;new jaws&quot;). Unlike other palaeognaths, tinamous do have a keeled sternum, but like the other palaeognaths, they have a distinctive palate. It was formerly believed that the Tinamiformes separated from the ratites early on due to their retention of a keeled sternum. The tinamous&#x27; possession of powder-down feathers and preen glands, which the other ratites lack, was another source of confusion in evaluating their taxonomy.
The tinamou family has been shown to be monophyletic. Phylogenomic studies have placed it as the sister group to extant Australasian and Oceanian ratites (i.e. the cassowaries, emus, and kiwis), thus putting it well within the ratite phylogenetic tree, with the South American rheas and African ostriches as successive outgroups. Research published starting in 2010 has found that tinamous are closest to the extinct moa of New Zealand; moa are more distantly related to the geographically proximate kiwis, emus and cassowaries than had been previously supposed. These findings imply that flightlessness evolved independently multiple times in ratite evolution. Flight may have been maintained in the tinamou family due to the rhea colonizing South America before ancestral tinamous arrived. The ecological niche for large, flightless herbivores was thus already occupied, forcing tinamous to retain smaller-bodied, omnivorous, and volant lifestyles.

===Fossil record===
Flight-capable lithornithids from the Paleocene and Eocene epochs appear to have been structurally the most similar precursors to the tinamous, and may have been ancestral to them as well as to the ratites, though their precise relationships are unclear. The earliest unequivocally Tinamiforme fossil material dates from the Miocene, but flightless ratite-like taxa from the Paleocene may belong to this group.

Several tinamou fossils have been found in the 16–17 Mya Early-Middle Miocene Santa Cruz Formation and the contemporary, or slightly older, Pinturas Formation, in Santa Cruz Province of Argentinian Patagonia, including a tinaminid, &quot;Crypturellus reai&quot;. Associated fossils indicate that the local palaeoenvironment at the beginning of this period was characterised by a humid, subtropical climate, with forest vegetation, becoming drier and more open with time. Some of the tinamou fossil material appears to be intermediate between the two subfamilies, suggesting that the period coincides with the origins of the radiation of the Nothurinae into the expanding open-country habitats.

Nothurine fossils referrable to &quot;Eudromia&quot; and &quot;Nothura&quot; have been found in the Late Miocene Cerro Azul Formation from the Pampean region of central-southern Argentina. Tinamous described from Pliocene material include &quot;Eudromia olsoni&quot; Tambussi &amp; Tonni, 1985, &quot;Nothura parvulus&quot; Rovereto, 1914, and &quot;Nothura padulosa&quot; Mercerat, 1897. The Pliocene fossil genera &quot;Cayetornis&quot; Brodkorb and &quot;Tinamisornis&quot; Rovereto have been synonymized with &quot;Nothura&quot; and &quot;Eudromia&quot; respectively. Fossils having affinities with several extant genera have been found in Pleistocene deposits.

==Description==

Tinamous are plump, compact birds with slender necks, small heads and, usually, short, bills, though a few have long bills. Females are usually larger than the males. The smallest species, the dwarf tinamou, weighs about with a length of . Females of the largest, the grey tinamou, weigh up to with a length of up to . Their feet have three forward-facing toes; a hind toe is either higher and retrogressed, or absent. The back of the tarsus is covered with scales, the color of which may aid in identification.

Tinamous have a pneumaticized skeleton with a sternal keel, 16–18 cervical vertebrae, and fused thoracic vertebrae. They have poor circulation, evidenced by a greenish tint to the skin. They also have relatively the smallest hearts and lungs of all birds, comprising only 1.6–3.1% of their body weight, whereas the equivalent in a domestic chicken is 12%. Despite their poor flying ability, the percentage of their body mass that is muscle is 28.6–40%, which is similar to that of hummingbirds. The preen gland is small and tufted. The male has a corkscrew shaped penis, similar to those of the other ratites and to the hemipenis of some reptiles. The female has a small phallic organ in the cloaca which becomes larger during the breeding season.

===Plumage===

The plumage of the family is cryptic, as is usual with ground birds, with typical colors ranging through dark brown, rufous, buff, yellow and grey. Plumage does not usually differ between sexes, but in a few species females are brighter. The forest dwellers tend to be darker and more uniform, whereas the steppe species are paler with more barring, speckling, or streaking. Tinamous have well-developed powder down feathers; these grow continuously and disintegrate at the tips into a powder that is spread through the rest of the feathers by preening. This gives the plumage a glossy appearance as well as waterproofing it. Their tails are short, sometimes hidden behind the coverts, and possibly indicative of an ability to sacrifice feathers to a predator in order to escape when grasped. Some tinamous have crests. Members of &quot;Eudromia&quot; have the most developed crests and, when excited, will direct them forward.

===Voice===

Tinamous are rarely seen but often heard within their range and have a wide variety of calls. They are among the most characteristic bird vocalizations of South America and Central America, often resembling sounds made by a flute or a whistle. Some calls are uniform and monotone, while others have multiple phrases. They vary in intensity and can often be heard from afar. Trying to locate a bird by its call is not easy.

Plains-dwelling tinamous have higher-pitched, more delicate voices. They can also be less melodic, sometimes resembling the chirps of crickets. Forest species tend to have deep, loud calls, suitable for penetrating the vegetation. The male highland tinamou can be heard several kilometres distant through dense forest. When calling, a tinamou extends its neck vertically, tilts its head at an angle, and opens its bill wide. A bird, when flushed, will utter a sharp trill.

Identification of tinamous is not an easy task; utilizing their calls as a tool is integral. Each species has its own unique call or calls. The solitary tinamou has 11 different vocalizations. In most species both sexes call; some have different calls for males and females. Females tend to have deeper voices. Some species, in particular members of &quot;Crypturellus&quot;, have regional dialects. Male slaty-breasted tinamous have calls unique enough to be individually recognized by humans.

Calls are typically heard more frequently during the breeding season. However, the time of day can differ amongst species, as some are more vocal in the morning, others in the evening, and some are more vocal during the heat of midday. Some will call at night from their roosts. Frequency can vary between species and between individuals. One male brushland tinamou called every few minutes from dawn until dusk (over 500 calls daily). Some, in particular &quot;Crypturellus&quot; species, use regular call sites. Only a few possess an alarm call.

==Distribution and habitat==

===Range===
Tinamous are exclusively neotropical and all 47 species live in South America, Mexico, and Central America. The range of the northernmost species extends to Mexico but not much further north than the Tropic of Cancer. Chilean tinamous have been introduced to Easter Island. The greatest concentration of species is in the tropics, and in particular the Amazon Basin. In the north, they tend to be forest or woodland birds, while in the south they prefer open habitats. Tinamous form the dominant group of terrestrial birds in South America, where they largely replace the Galliformes ecologically, with no other bird family there having comparable diversity, distribution, or suite of habitat adaptations. Rheas are only found in open country, curassows and guans are generally limited to forests, and the pheasant family is only represented by a few species in the north of the region.

They occur in a wide range of habitats. Members of the genera &quot;Tinamus&quot;, &quot;Nothocercus&quot;, and &quot;Crypturellus&quot; live in dense forests, with &quot;Nothocercus&quot; preferring high altitude, and members of most other genera in grassland, puna, montane forest, and savanna. &quot;Tinamotis&quot; and &quot;Nothoprocta&quot; prefer high altitude habitats, up to , whereas the other steppe tinamous have a wide altitude range. Tinamous inhabit most parts of South and Central America, as well as the tropical regions of Mexico, with the exception of aquatic, snow-covered, and true desert habitats, and the southernmost tip of Patagonia.

===Ecology===

Behavioral and ecological separation of tinamou species is evident where their ranges overlap through the utilization of different food sources and occupation of limited micro-habitats. These micro-habitats are not always easy to identify, and are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Some species, such as the red-winged tinamou, utilize multiple habitats such as the open savannas of Amazonia and the dry valleys of the Andes. Similarly, brown tinamous occur in both the Amazon basin and the humid montane forests on the Andean slope.

Panama provides examples of ecological separation. The highland tinamou occupies the highlands throughout the country. The great tinamou prefers the rainforests on the slopes. The Choco tinamou also likes the rainforest, but is limited to the south-east of the country. Finally, the little tinamou is found in dense secondary forest on either the Pacific or Atlantic slope above . Size difference allows the red-winged tinamou and the spotted nothura to coexist, as they both occupy the same habitat of Brazil, the tropical savanna. The former prefers long grass pastures, while the latter prefers short grass.

Further examples of such diversity are found in the Andes, where a small subspecies of Darwin&#x27;s nothura, &quot;Nothura darwinii boliviana&quot;, occurs in grassland at about above sea level. Here also are the red-winged tinamou which prefers open ground with some scrub, and the Andean tinamou which prefers dense vegetation beside streams. Their habitat extends upslope through the &quot;Polylepis&quot; woodlands into puna grassland. In the puna is another subspecies of Darwin&#x27;s nothura, &quot;Nothura darwinii agassizii&quot;, which prefers tussock grassland. Also in the puna is the ornate tinamou which frequents the rocky slopes and cliffs of tola heath. Higher in the puna is the puna tinamou, living just below the snowline at as well as in the semi-deserts of the southern Altiplano.

===Movements===

Tinamous are largely sedentary birds. Forest-dwelling tinamous will move short distances if climatic conditions, such as intense rain, flooding or drought force them to. Most Amazonian species will move between the varzea forests and dry land depending on water levels. The puna tinamou occupies high ridges in the Andes but, in bad weather, will move down to the valley floors.

Forest species, such as the slaty-breasted tinamou, maintain large home ranges through which they move in apparently random patterns. The male brushland tinamou maintains a home territory of , but will occasionally wander outside it into those of his neighbors. Females will wander throughout multiple males&#x27; territories. The ornate tinamou lives mainly upslope in hilly puna grassland but will move each morning to the bottom of the slopes to feed and drink. Granivorous species will move daily into grain fields with some, such as Darwin&#x27;s nothura, remaining in the fields until there is no food left. Open country and southern species maintain territories only during the breeding season and at other times seem to wander at random.

==Behavior==
Tinamous form one of the most terrestrial groups of flying birds, spending virtually all of their time on the ground. They walk silently, pausing frequently in mid-stride. When a potential threat is detected, a tinamou will typically freeze in one of two positions, either crouched or with its neck extended upwards. As far as possible, they will avoid resorting to flight by stealthy walking or running away from danger as well as by concealment in dense vegetation. They may then pause to observe the cause of their alarm from cover. They also hide in burrows. Their cryptic behavior has allowed them to survive or even thrive in areas where guans have been extirpated.

===Flight===
Unlike the related ratites, tinamous can fly, though poorly and reluctantly, preferring to walk or run. When forced to take to the air, they do so only for short distances at high speed. Their small wings give them a high wing loading. They take off with rapid and noisy wing beats, until they have gained sufficient altitude, then glide while slipping sideways, with an occasional further burst of flapping. Due to their near lack of a tail to serve as rudder or counterweight, tinamous are notoriously poor at steering. They regularly crash into objects on attempting to take off, sometimes with fatal consequences. They rarely fly more than and typically do so downslope where the terrain allows. They land in an upright position with upstretched neck. Some species will land running. The brushland tinamou will perform a sharp 90° turn immediately before touching down.

===Roosting===

Although tinamous are diurnal, many species become less active in the middle of the day. They rest or feed during this period, while during the night they will cease all activity. They are wary of the dark; they roost at night and have been known to roost during solar eclipses. Roosting of the larger forest species, such as those in &quot;Tinamus&quot;, occurs in trees. They prefer horizontal branches approximately off the ground, choosing sites with good views and clear exits. In order to minimize the effort involved in ascending to their roosts, in hilly terrain they will access them from uphill and, when threatened, will fly downhill to gain more distance from the threat.

Tinamous prefer thick branches on which to roost as they do not clutch the branch with their toes, but rest on it with folded legs. They will reuse the same locations and avoid defecating nearby to avoid advertising the roost site to predators. The smaller forest species, along with the steppe tinamous, will roost on the ground, sometimes in the shelter of a bush. They will also use the same location repeatedly; known examples are the elegant crested and ornate tinamous.

===Sociality===
Tinamous, depending on the species, may be solitary or social and gather in groups. Gregariousness also varies by season. Forest species tend to be solitary and may only approach other birds during the breeding season. Some live as mated pairs throughout the year. Steppe or grassland species tend to live in groups, though with little obvious group interaction apart from an occasional contact call. Group size may vary by season; in winter, aggregations of elegant crested tinamous may approach 100 birds.

Both steppe and forest species are territorial, though territoriality varies between species from being characteristic only during the breeding season, to being territorial throughout the year. When defending their territories from conspecifics, tinamous are highly vocal, creating a cacophony of sound. When an intruder is noticed, birds of the same sex will confront it. This may lead to conflict, with feet and wings being used in attack. Both males and females will defend their territories; however, in each species only one sex is fiercely territorial.

==Breeding==

In most tinamou species, the males practice simultaneous polygyny and the females sequential polyandry. This is not invariable; ornate tinamous form stable pairs, and spotted nothuras are monogamous when young and polygamous when older. There are larger numbers of females than males; for example, the variegated tinamou has a female to male ratio of 4:1.

The breeding season varies from species to species; those that live in tropical forests, where there is little seasonal change, may breed at any time, though there is usually a preferred period. In areas with a marked seasonal fluctuation, tinamous generally breed when food is most abundant, which is usually summer. Studies have shown that it is not day length that determines the onset of breeding, but the amount of light, through cloud cover.

===Courtship===
The courtship process starts with the male vocally advertising his abilities with continuous calling. He will try to attract multiple females. In &quot;Tinamus&quot; species, the male will lower his chest to the ground, stretch his neck forward, and fluff up his back to appear larger than normal. When observed head on, all of the bird&#x27;s back is in view while the under-tail coverts are exposed, a pose similar to that used by the rhea. The female will scratch her feet on the ground as part of the ritual.

===Nesting===
Tinamous always nest on the ground; in open areas, near a bush; in scrub, in a dense patch of grass; in forest, at the base of a tree trunk between the buttresses. The highland tinamou is unique in that it sites its nest in a cavity or under an overhanging rock on a steep slope. Many species do not build a nest, choosing to lay their eggs on a thin bed of leaves. Other species do construct nests and are meticulous in doing so. The nest of the ornate tinamou is circular and made of grass on a turf surface. The male brushland tinamou starts to scrape out a nest once copulation has occurred; several may be constructed though only one is used.

===Egg-laying===
A tinamou female lays several eggs which the male incubates while the female departs to seek another mate. Large species will lay one egg every 3–4 days, while the smaller ones lay on consecutive days. The females lay eggs in multiple nests throughout the nesting season.

There may be as many as 16 eggs in a clutch, a consequence of several females laying in the same nest. The more mature male will attract more females and may have the eggs of up to four females under him. The variegated and ornate tinamous have single-female nests, and consequently only one or two eggs per nest. This may result from food shortage in their ranges and the consequent ability to care for only one or two chicks.

The eggs are fairly deeply colored, usually in a single color, and have a hard porcelain-like gloss. Colors vary with species, ranging through green, purple, violet, turquoise, steel grey, chocolate and lemon-yellow. White is rare, but does occur. Though the eggs are bright and colorful when laid, over time they fade and become duller. For example, the egg of the red-winged tinamou dulls from purple to leaden. Most tinamou eggs are solid colored, without spots or speckling; however, the eggs of &quot;Tinamotis&quot; species may exhibit small white speckles. The benefit of laying brightly colored eggs is unknown, but is not detrimental as most tinamou predators hunt at night.

Eggs are relatively large compared to the mass of the female, though even the largest birds produce eggs very similar in size to the smallest of species. Their shapes are either spherical or elliptical; the two ends are similar in shape, and difficult to distinguish. The shells are thin enough to see the embryos within.

===Incubation===

Incubation takes about 16 days in &quot;Crypturellus&quot;, which contains the smallest species, and 19–20 days in &quot;Tinamus&quot; and &quot;Eudromia&quot;. During this period the male is typically silent; if he does call, he does so away from the nest. As he incubates, he will leave the nest to feed, and he may be gone from 45 minutes to five hours, covering the eggs when he leaves. While incubating, he is mainly motionless and reluctant to move, even from potential danger. It is possible for a human observer to approach and touch the incubating male without eliciting an overt response. Some species will flatten themselves against the ground, stretch out their necks, and raise their backs to the air. This posture causes them to resemble a plant; however, if it is overdone, the eggs become visible from behind.

If the male becomes alarmed enough to leave the nest, he will attempt a distraction display. This usually involves a fake injury display, similar to that of the killdeer. To do this, he will hop on one leg and attempt to fly, always falling down. He will perform this display if the eggs have not hatched or the chicks are still too young to fly. It is generally believed that tinamous are not as effective at distraction displays as other birds.

===Chicks===

Chicks hatch synchronously with a dense downy coat. The coloring is white, grey or yellow, with dark spots to aid in camouflage. The young are precocial, and can run almost as soon as they hatch. Soon after hatching the eggs, the male will leave the nest and call the chicks to him with a soft contact call. If threatened, he will freeze and attempt to hide the chicks under his wings or belly. There have been documented cases of females caring for the young; it is thought that this occurs when the male has been killed. Young chicks can feed themselves within the first few days, but the male will bring the food and drop it on the ground in front of them. The chicks have a high initial mortality rate. However, within a few days they are chasing insects on their own and, at 1–3 weeks, they can fly to branches a metre from the ground. They are self-sufficient within 20 days.

By 20 days, the young slaty-breasted tinamou has gained adult size, though not adult weight. The spotted nothura will go from 10% of adult weight to 90% within 85 days, and the red-winged tinamou will do so in 108 days. Sexual maturity comes at the age of one year, although some species may be physiologically mature by 57 days. However, some behavior may need to be learned before the birds can breed successfully.

Once done with the brood the male, if still within the breeding season, will seek out another female and initiate the cycle again. Studies have shown that 54–62% of breeding female spotted nothura are first-year birds.

==Feeding==

===Foods===
Tinamous are opportunistic feeders and eat a wide range of foods, though each species varies in proportional dietary makeup. Tinamou genera can be roughly divided into three groups based on the vegetable component of their diets. &quot;Tinamus&quot;, &quot;Nothocercus&quot; and &quot;Crypturellus&quot; focus on fleshy fruit. &quot;Nothura&quot;, &quot;Nothoprocta&quot; and &quot;Eudromia&quot;, comprising open country birds, eat mainly seeds and other soft vegetative matter. High-altitude genera living in harsh environments, such as &quot;Tinamotis&quot;, will eat most of the plant, not just the succulent parts.

Most species eat a mixture of plant and animal products, though some are mainly herbivorous and others predominantly insectivorous or carnivorous. Diet may also vary seasonally; red-winged tinamous eat mostly animal food in the summer and plant matter in the winter. Chicks eat more insects than their parents, probably for their growth needs.

Consumed plant material includes fruit (either fallen or on the tree), seeds, green shoots, tender leaves, buds, flowers, tender stems, roots, and tubers. Much of the animal food consists of insects, including ants, termites, beetles, grasshoppers, Hemiptera, and lepidopteran larvae, as well as gastropods, mollusks, worms, and small vertebrates, such as amphibians and reptiles. Larger species will eat small mammals.

===Feeding methods===
Food is taken mainly off the ground but also off the vine. The birds may jump for fruit or, as with the &quot;Crypturellus&quot; species, jump up to a metre in height for insects. The main foraging technique is a slow walk with head down, pecking at the ground and looking up occasionally. Small animals are eaten whole, larger ones are beaten against the ground or pecked. Bills rather than feet are used to probe leaf litter and sift through soil deep.

The most frequent diggers are &quot;Rhynchotus&quot;, &quot;Nothura&quot; and &quot;Nothoprocta&quot; species, which are open country birds. They have their nostrils positioned at the base of the bills, a feature thought to be an adaptation to their digging. As with most birds, they swallow grit to aid their gizzards in digestion. Some species follow army ants, eating from the disturbance created. Others feed in the company of antbirds, formicariids, and ovenbirds. &quot;Nothura&quot; species, in particular, will follow livestock and eat the ticks that fall off them as well as the insects knocked off bushes as they pass.

===Drinking===
Water is required by most tinamou species, with some needing a good source within their home territory. Solitary tinamous can withstand an extended period without water by eating more succulent plants. However, species that live in arid or semi-arid climates rarely need any water additional to that ingested with their diet. When tinamous drink, unlike most other birds, they do so by sucking and swallowing, instead of lifting their heads and letting gravity do the work.

==Health and mortality==

===Hygiene===
Tinamous are avid bathers. During heavy rain they may stand erect with their bill pointing skyward allowing the rain to wash over them. They will dust-bathe at regular intervals, and have been known to dust-bathe often enough to tint themselves the same color as the soil. They also sunbathe, and will do so while resting on one leg with an outstretched wing. Defecation for a tinamou is a slightly involved task as it must move aside the dense plumage that surrounds the cloaca to avoid soiling itself. Captive tinamous defecate once daily.

===Parasites===
There are over 240 species of bird lice that infest tinamous, with one individual bird recorded as hosting nine species. Blood parasites include louse flies, leeches, nematodes, cestodes, armadillo ticks, mites, and trematodes. Darwin&#x27;s nothura may carry a malarial plasmodium.

===Predators===
Tinamou predators include cats, foxes, raccoons, skunks, weasels, tayras, rats, peccaries, and opossums. Legend speaks of jaguars that imitate the call to trick and catch them. Nests are vulnerable to snakes, monkeys and opossums. Giant anteaters have been seen on Marajo Island breaking tinamou eggs. Forest falcons and orange-breasted falcons have been seen hunting them, and vampire bats lap their blood.

==Relationship with humans==

===Mythology===
Tinamous have established themselves in the folklore and histories of the indigenous people of South America and Central America. Forest tribes of Brazil and Colombia believe the jaguar imitates the call of the great tinamou in order to track and eat it. A tale from the Guahibo Indians tells of a young man traveling by canoe who tried to locate a calling tinamou. As he approached the bank he became suspicious at the harshness of the call and backed away just as a jaguar burst out of the vegetation.

Panamanian tradition states that after the &quot;Great Flood&quot;, the great tinamou grew frightened of the bright colors in the rainbow. He flew away from the rainbow, the ark, and the rest of the animals, heading for the darkest part of the forest, where he has remained ever since.

A Brazilian legend explains of the separation of the red-winged tinamou and the undulated tinamou. The story starts off with how inseparable the two birds were, as they did everything together. One day they got into an argument and split up. The undulated tinamou went into the deepest dark of the forest, and the red-winged tinamou wanting to be different went to the grassy plains. One day, the undulated tinamou was feeling sad and lonely, went to the forest&#x27;s edge and called his old friend. &quot;Shall we make up?&quot; he cries. The red-winged tinamou responds with &quot;What me, never again&quot;. This story is meant to show that they are often heard but seldom seen.

===Introduction and translocation===

During the 20th century there were numerous attempts to introduce or reintroduce tinamous to various parts of the world. The red-winged tinamou has been reintroduced to the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where its wild population was hunted to extermination at the turn of the 20th century. France, Germany, and Hungary have all, unsuccessfully, attempted to introduce them into their countryside.

There have been several unsuccessful attempts to introduce tinamous to the United States. In Oregon, between 1966 and 1974, 473 ornate tinamous and 110 red-winged tinamou were brought in. In 1966 and 1971, Florida introduced 128 spotted nothura. In 1969, 47 and 136 spotted nothura were introduced to Alabama and Texas. 1970 saw Colorado and Oklahoma introducing 164 and 100 Darwin&#x27;s nothura respectively. In 1971, Nebraska brought 256 elegant crested tinamou, and California introduced 217 in 1969, and 1200 between 1971 and 1977. The 1885 introduction of Chilean tinamou to Easter Island was successful, though the population has not prospered since Chimango caracaras were introduced in 1928.

===Domestication and aviculture===

No tinamou species has been successfully domesticated so far, despite their ability to breed well in captivity. The red-winged tinamou has been bred on farms in France, Great Britain, Belgium, and Denmark. They, along with some of the &quot;Crypturellus&quot; species, are being bred in Rio Grande do Sul to boost numbers for hunting. Hybridization can occur.

Many South American zoos hold tinamous, as do some private estates. Examples of captive breeding are small-billed tinamou in Minas Gerais and red-winged tinamou in Rio Grande do Sul. The small-billed tinamou has looked promising for domestication as the birds can raise three to four broods per year and are resistant to diseases that affect domestic chickens.

===Pests===
Several species have adapted to agricultural systems and will enter grain fields after the harvest to glean the ground; they will also enter the fields during the growing season, to the dismay of the farmers. Some, in particular the ornate and Andean tinamous, will dig up tubers such as potatoes, while red-winged tinamous create similar problems in peanut plantations. However, some members of &quot;Nothoprocta&quot; will prey on insect pests without damaging the crops. Spotted nothuras have been documented eating weeds and, of the 28 animals they were recorded as eating, 26 were considered to be pests.

===Research===
The Tinamiformes are one of the least studied orders of birds despite tinamous exhibiting rare and little understood behavioral patterns. They have male parental care which is not always associated with polyandry or sex-role reversal. Their varied mating systems and diverse habitats have the potential, through comparative studies, to explain how ecological differences affect mating strategies. In some species, females cooperate in assembling clutches of eggs for different males. However, methodological difficulties have hampered behavioral research, especially on the forest dwelling species, because their secretive behavior and cryptic coloration make them difficult to follow for continuous observation. It was not until 2003 that the first scientific symposium on tinamous was organized at the VIIth Neotropical Ornithological Congress, held at Termas de Puyehue, Chile.

==Status and conservation==
The status of the family is not easy to determine as many species live in the Amazon Basin or the far reaches of the Andes and attract little attention, even from ornithologists. Moreover, their cryptic coloration and behavior means that their presence often remains unnoticed. A large proportion of the species are Amazonian, with the majority of these decreasing in range. Most, however, are surviving well enough so far to avoid being classified as threatened.

Major threats are habitat fragmentation and destruction. Although they are hunted throughout their range, it generally has little or only localized impact on the populations of the more widespread and common species. Pesticides are a problem throughout the grasslands and farmlands. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies seven tinamou species as vulnerable and seven as near threatened. The solitary tinamou is listed under Appendix I of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).

===Land clearance===

The major threat for the forest tinamous is deforestation. Neotropical forests are badly affected, with large tracts being clearcut for cropping, pasture or timber plantations. Much of this land is poor in nutrients, so is abandoned after a few years for newly cleared land. Forest species are consequently forced to adapt, relocate, or die out. As well as the forests, most types of habitat in Middle and South America, apart from the high Andes and Patagonia, are under threat. There is controversy over the vegetative history with speculation that what is now high-altitude grassland in the Andes was once elfin forest.

The dwarf tinamou is a resident of the open plains of eastern Brazil, though there are fewer than 10,000 birds left. It appears to have disappeared from its former range on the grasslands of Argentina and Paraguay. In the cerrado grasslands of Brazil the population of the lesser nothura has also decreased to fewer than 10,000 individuals because of agricultural and economic development. The practice of burning the fields is particularly detrimental to grassland tinamous. For example, the dwarf tinamou becomes intoxicated with the smoke and vulnerable to predators. Moreover, if the burning occurs during the nesting season, the eggs or chicks are roasted.

The solitary tinamou, limited to the Atlantic forests of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina, is threatened by habitat destruction and hunting. In the cloud forests of northern South America, there are fewer than 10,000 black tinamous left. The tepui tinamou&#x27;s range is limited to the tops of a handful of plateaus in the cloud forests of Venezuela, making it highly vulnerable to any threat.

===Hunting===

Tinamous have been popular game birds for many years in South America and Central America, so much so that some species&#x27; numbers have dropped. The steppe birds are more popular to hunt because they can be flushed into flight, rather than the forest birds that run to cover and hide. In the late 19th and early 20th century hunting was responsible for mass killing within the family, with the elegant crested tinamou and spotted nothura popular targets. In 1921, Argentina urged the control of commercial hunting of several bird species, including tinamou.

Between 1890 and 1899, in Buenos Aires alone, 18 million tinamou were sold in meat markets. They were also marketed in North America as &quot;South American partridge&quot;. One shipment alone comprised 360,000 birds. Frank Chapman of the American Museum of Natural History helped raise awareness about the rate of exploitation and its potential impact on the populations of the species. Eventually, the USA banned the importation of the birds.

Hunting pressures remain, though at a reduced level. For example, 25,000–40,000 spotted nothura are killed annually through legal hunting, not counting poaching. Although some grassland species have increased in both range and numbers, they remain vulnerable to hunting with the use of dogs to flush them. Native peoples also are involved in the killing tinamou for meat, catching them in nooses or traps after imitating their calls. A family of seven in Ceará will consume 60 nothura per year. Tinamou species are among the most commonly harvested birds by subsistence hunting in the Americas.

Some species are highly vulnerable to illegal hunting, or poaching. In Brazil, illegal hunts take place at night by torchlight. The use of flutes to imitate the calls during the breeding season to lure the birds into the open can result in local extermination. Overall, there is a lack of adequate controls in place to ensure sustainable hunting, as well as insufficient resources and determination to enforce existing regulations.

<doc id="207908" wikidata="Q2034459" url="?curid=207908" title="Coat of arms of Nova Scotia">
<text>The coat of arms of Nova Scotia is the heraldic symbol representing the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. It is the oldest provincial achievement of arms in Canada, and the oldest British coat of arms in use outside Great Britain. It is blazoned as follows: &quot;Argent, a saltire azure charged with an escutcheon of the Royal Arms of Scotland&quot;.

The arms were originally granted in 1625 by King Charles I for the first Scottish colony on the Canadian mainland. The arms are also borne as a heraldic badge by the Baronets of Nova Scotia, a chivalric order of Great Britain.

They fell out of use when Nova Scotia joined the Confederation in 1867, but were restored in 1929 by royal warrant of King George V.

== History ==

The arms were originally granted in 1625 by King Charles I as part of a Scottish settlement attempt in Nova Scotia led by Sir William Alexander. These remained in use until the mid 19th century, appearing on the great seal of the province used prior to Confederation in 1867, after which all the provincial great seals were replaced with new ones delivered in 1868. That for Nova Scotia had a new coat of arms comprising a salmon on a blue band between three thistles, on a gold field. The provincial government disliked this and wanted to continue using the old seal, but the federal government did not initially take the necessary steps to facilitate this. Pressure to restore it grew, and it was reassumed in 1929, with the newer arms being abandoned. The original coat of arms was augmented with a compartment upon the issue of the new royal warrant in 1929.

The 1867–1929 shield was blazoned &quot;Or, on a fess wavy azure between three thistles proper a salmon naiant argent.&quot;

==Symbolism==

;Crest
:Two hands, one naked and the other clad in armour, holding a thistle, representing Scotland, and laurel, representing peace.
;Shield
:The shield, a blue saltire on a white field, is a simple reversal of the Scottish flag (a white saltire, Saint Andrew&#x27;s cross, on a blue field). It is also charged with an escutcheon bearing the Royal arms of Scotland; a gold shield with a red rampant lion in a double border decorated with fleurs de lis.
;Compartment
:The compartment includes thistles as well as the trailing arbutus or mayflower, the floral emblem of Nova Scotia, added when the arms were reassumed in 1929.
;Supporters
:The supporters are the unicorn from the royal arms of Scotland which is now borne by the British monarchy, and a member of the Mi&#x27;kmaq First Nation indigenous to Nova Scotia, who in the heraldic language of the 17th century was blazoned a &quot;savage.&quot; When the grant of arms was registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority in 2007, the sinister supporter was redescribed as &quot;a 17th century representation of a North American Indian.&quot;

;Motto
:&quot;Munit haec et altera vincit&quot; (&quot;One [hand] defends and the other conquers&quot;), placed above the shield in the Scottish tradition.

<doc id="207910" wikidata="Q7870374" url="?curid=207910" title="USS Independence (1814)">
<text>USS &quot;Independence&quot; was a wooden-hulled, three-masted ship, originally a ship of the line and the first to be commissioned by the United States Navy. Originally a 90-gun ship, in 1836 she was cut down by one deck and re-rated as a 54-gun frigate.

==Service history==

===Mediterranean Fleet, 1814–1822===

Launched on 22 June 1814 in the Boston Navy Yard, she immediately took on guns and was stationed with frigate in Boston. She could not cruise until the end of the War of 1812 as she was blockaded in port by a squadron consisting of a number of 74-gun ships and the 98-gun HMS &quot;Boyne&quot;. Flying the broad pennant of Commodore William Bainbridge, and under command of Captain William M. Crane, she led her squadron from Boston on 3 July 1815 to deal with piratical acts of the Barbary States against American merchant commerce.

Peace had been enforced by a squadron under Stephen Decatur by the time &quot;Independence&quot; arrived in the Mediterranean. But she led an impressive show of American naval might before Barbary ports that encouraged them to keep the peace treaties concluded. Having served adequate notice of rising U.S. seapower and added to the prestige of the Navy and the Nation, &quot;Independence&quot; returned to Newport, Rhode Island on 15 November 1815. She continued to wear the pennant of Commodore Bainbridge at Boston until 29 November 1819, then was flagship of Commodore John Shaw until placed in ordinary in 1822.

===Refit 1836===
&quot;Independence&quot; remained in ordinary at Boston until 1836 when she was razeed (cut down to one covered fighting deck with poop and forecastle). She was rated down to 54 guns as her configuration gave way to that of a very large frigate. She proved to be one of the fastest and most powerful &quot;frigates&quot; of the Navy.

===Russia, South America, Home Squadron, 1837–1845===
&quot;Independence&quot; recommissioned on 26 March 1837 and sailed from Boston on 20 May 1837 as flagship of Commodore John B. Nicholson. On board for her record passage across the Atlantic Ocean to England was the Honorable George Dallas, Minister to Russia. She arrived at Portsmouth, England, 13 June, called at Copenhagen; then proceeded into Kronstadt 29 July 1837 to receive a visit from the Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. Two days later a steam boat arrived to transport Mr. Dallas and his family to St. Petersburg.

Having received marked social courtesies from the Russian government, &quot;Independence&quot; departed Kronstadt on 13 August 1837 for Rio de Janeiro, where she became flagship of the Brazil Squadron to guard American commerce along the eastern seaboard of South America. This duty continued into the spring of 1839 when Commodore Nicholson attempted mediation to end the war between France and Argentina. He reported 22 April 1839 that:

&quot;Independence&quot; returned north to New York on 30 March 1840. She was laid up in ordinary until 14 May 1842 when she became flagship of Commodore Charles Stewart in the Home Squadron. Based at Boston and New York, she continued as his flagship until laid up in ordinary on 3 December 1845.

===Mexican War, 1846–1849===
She recommissioned on 4 August 1846, and the nation was already at war with Mexico as she departed Boston 29 August 1846 for the coast of California. She entered Monterey Bay on 22 January 1847 and became the flagship of Commodore William Shubrick, commanding the Pacific Squadron.

&quot;Independence&quot; assisted in the blockade of the Mexican coast, capturing Mexican ship &quot;Correo&quot; and a launch on 16 May 1847. She was present to support the capture of Guaymas on 19 October and landed sailors and Marines to occupy Mazatlán on 11 November 1847. She later cruised as far as Hawaii, arriving Hilo on 12 August 1848, arriving Lahaina on 30 August 1848 and Honolulu 4 September 1848. &quot;Independence&quot; returned to the East Coast at Norfolk, Virginia on 23 May 1849 and decommissioned there on 30 May.

===Mediterranean, Pacific, 1849–1912===
Recommissioned on 7 July 1849, &quot;Independence&quot; departed Norfolk on 26 July under Captain Thomas Conover to serve as flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron under Commodore Charles Morgan. She was the first U.S. man-of-war to show the flag at Spezia, Italy, arriving on 23 May 1850 to an enthusiastic welcome. She returned to Norfolk on 25 June 1852 and was placed in ordinary at New York on 3 July 1852.

&quot;Independence&quot; was recommissioned in September 1854 and departed New York on 10 October to serve as flagship of the Pacific Squadron under Commodore William Mervine. She arrived Valparaíso, Chile, on 2 February 1855. Her cruising grounds ranged northward to San Francisco and west to Hawaii. Proceeding from Panama Bay, she entered the Mare Island Navy Yard on 2 October 1857. She served as receiving ship there until decommissioned on 3 November 1912. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 3 September 1913.

===Decommissioning and fate===
&quot;Independence&quot; did not leave the Mare Island Navy Yard until 28 November 1914. Sold to John H. Rinder, she was towed to the Union Iron Works, San Francisco. On 5 March 1915 she shifted to Hunters Point, and remained for a week. Some repairs were made and a plan formulated to use her as a restaurant for the Panama–Pacific International Exposition. But this plan was not executed though a permit was granted by Exposition authorities. Pig iron and ballast were removed from her hold and valuable hard wood salvaged from her orlop deck knees. On the night of 20 September 1915, &quot;Independence&quot; was burned on the Hunter&#x27;s Point mud flats to recover her metal fittings.

Unlike her three close friends, Elaine is absent from the pilot episode. Previously the female role was supposed to be Claire, the waitress at Pete&#x27;s Luncheonette played by Lee Garlington, but Monk&#x27;s Cafe replaced the luncheonette and Garlington was dropped from the role. Elaine first appears in &quot;The Stake Out&quot;, but in production order she appears in a final scene eating M&amp;Ms in &quot;Male Unbonding&quot;. NBC executives felt the show was too male-centric, and demanded that Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David add a woman to the cast as a condition for commissioning the show, as revealed in the commentary on the Season 1 and 2 DVD. In addition to the first episode, Elaine does not appear in &quot;The Trip&quot; (Louis-Dreyfus having been in the late stages of pregnancy at the time of filming) and therefore appears in fewer episodes than George and Jerry.

== Real-life inspiration ==
After it was discovered that Jerry Seinfeld once dated writer and comedian Carol Leifer, speculation grew that Elaine was based on Leifer, though that was later largely denied. Leifer, who wrote or co-wrote a number of episodes for the show, has said only some elements of the backstory of the character — that she and Seinfeld had dated and have remained good friends since the relationship ended — relate to her. Leifer has said some elements of the character of Elaine, especially her assertiveness, intelligence and sense of humor, are drawn from the off-screen personality of Julia Louis-Dreyfus herself. According to Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s biography (written by Jerry Oppenheimer), Elaine was based in part on Susan McNabb (who was dating Seinfeld when the character was created), though eventually named after friend and fellow comic Elayne Boosler. The character was also partially based on Monica Yates (daughter of novelist Richard Yates), whom Larry David once dated; they remained good friends after they broke up.

It has been reported that other actresses were in line to play the character, including Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Megan Mullally, Jessica Lundy, Patricia Heaton, Mariska Hargitay, and Amy Yasbeck.

On the DVD commentary for the season-1 episode, “The Stakeout”, Larry David says that Elaine was based on, “…every ex-girlfriend [Jerry] and I ever had.”

== Background and education ==
Unlike George, Jerry and Kramer, Elaine is not a native of New York City, having grown up in the affluent Baltimore suburb of Towson, and is shown to be a fan of the Baltimore Orioles. She attended finishing school and completed her undergraduate education at Tufts University, revealed to be her safety school in &quot;The Puerto Rican Day&quot;, as a French literature major. In &quot;The Dog&quot;, she tells George she moved to New York in 1986, which, by coincidence, is the year Jerry moved into his apartment across the hall from Kramer. She started dating Jerry later that year. In &quot;The Doodle&quot; it is stated by George that Elaine takes a drawing class at The New School with his girlfriend Paula.

Elaine&#x27;s religious beliefs are never fully confirmed, and she appears to have little interest in religion. She expresses shock when Puddy is revealed as a devout Christian. She views saying &quot;God bless you&quot; as a &quot;silly superstition&quot; in &quot;The Good Samaritan&quot;. It is likely that Elaine was raised Catholic, as her last name is Czech in origin (see Edvard Beneš) and the Czech people are, for the most part, historically Catholic. It is strongly suggested in the show that Elaine is Catholic when she is seen making the sign of the cross before entering Jerry&#x27;s apartment to retrieve a manuscript while the apartment is being fumigated in &quot;The Doodle&quot;, and crosses herself again in &quot;The Betrayal&quot; after turning her back on a Hindu altar. Furthermore, in &quot;The Pick&quot;, Elaine is horrified when she realizes she sent a Christmas card which features her nipple to &quot;Sister Mary Catherine&quot; and &quot;Father Chelios&quot;. In multiple episodes, including &quot;The Strong Box&quot; and &quot;The Wizard&quot;, she can be seen wearing a crucifix. In multiple episodes, including &quot;The Soup&quot;, she is seen wearing cross earrings. In &quot;The Postponement&quot; and &quot;The Fatigues&quot;, Elaine states that she is not Jewish.

== Family ==
Though her ethnicity is never made clear, the name Beneš is a common Czech surname. Her boyfriend incorrectly assumed that she was Hispanic in &quot;The Wizard&quot;. In &quot;The Wink&quot;, her cousin Holly repeatedly mentions a &quot;Grandma Mema&quot; who apparently shared a mutual dislike with Elaine&#x27;s side of the family. Elaine claims to have an IQ of 145 (although her scores range from 85 to 151).

Elaine&#x27;s father, a gruff novelist named Alton Benes (Lawrence Tierney), was featured in &quot;The Jacket&quot;. In &quot;The Wait Out&quot;, Elaine reveals to David Lookner that Alton left her and the rest of her family when she was nine years old. Elaine is the only main character in the series whose mother never makes an appearance.

Elaine has a sister, Gail, and a nephew; they are first mentioned in &quot;The Pick&quot;. In &quot;The Airport&quot;, it is revealed that Gail lives in St. Louis. Elaine has a cousin, Holly, who appears in &quot;The Wink&quot;, where reference is made to Elaine&#x27;s grandmother Mema, from whom Holly inherited a set of cloth napkins. It is not revealed if Mema is her maternal or paternal grandmother.

In &quot;The Stock Tip&quot;, Elaine mentions she has an Uncle Pete. In &quot;The Secret Code&quot;, she mentions an uncle who worked in the Texas School Book Depository with Lee Harvey Oswald. Whether the two uncles are the same person is not revealed.

== Employment ==
During Seasons 2 to 5, Elaine works at Pendant Publishing under her boss Mr. Lippman, where she served as a copy editor. She loses her job at the end of Season 5 when the company goes bankrupt and a misunderstanding resulting from her penchant for chewy, speech-impairing Jujyfruit candies thwarts a merger that might have saved the company. (&quot;The Opposite&quot;).

Elaine then becomes a personal assistant to the eccentric, demanding Justin Pitt, starting in &quot;The Chaperone&quot;, but later is fired when Mr. Pitt thinks she and Jerry are conspiring to kill him in &quot;The Diplomat&#x27;s Club&quot;.

After meeting J. Peterman on the street in &quot;The Understudy&quot; in season 6, she becomes an editor at his &quot;J. Peterman Catalog&quot;, where she remains employed for the rest of the series. Starting in &quot;The Foundation&quot;, she takes charge of the catalog when Peterman suffers a nervous breakdown and flees to Burma. Once Peterman returns in &quot;The Money&quot; she is demoted back to her former position. Peterman also fires her twice: first when her penchant for poppy seed muffins causes her to fail a drug test in &quot;The Shower Head&quot; and later in &quot;The English Patient&quot; when she expresses her hatred for the movie &quot;The English Patient&quot;. She is able to recover her job by agreeing to live temporarily in a remote cave in the desert of Tunisia.

== Personality ==
In &quot;The Sponge&quot;, Elaine is desperate to buy a cache of discontinued contraceptive sponges before existing stock is exhausted. She coins the word &quot;spongeworthy&quot; debating her then-boyfriend&#x27;s prospects of intimacy at the expense of her inventory.

In “The Cafe”, Elaine took an IQ test for George, who was worried about being embarrassed by the score. On her second attempt, she received a score of 151, a genius-level IQ.

In &quot;The Stall&quot;, Elaine is dating Tony, a very good-looking athletic type. After a rock climbing accident mangles Tony&#x27;s face, Elaine admits to Jerry that she cannot date somebody who is unattractive and wonders how long she is obligated to stay with him post-accident.

Elaine has a particular affection for &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. In &quot;The Pen&quot;, Elaine shows her love for the movie when she becomes unintentionally high on muscle relaxers and repeatedly screams &quot;Stella&quot; at a fancy awards dinner for Morty Seinfeld in Florida.

In &quot;The Boyfriend&quot;, Elaine reveals her disgust for smokers, which leads to a breakup with Keith Hernandez. Her dislike of smoking also leads to an argument with a fortune-teller in &quot;The Suicide&quot;. However, in &quot;The Calzone&quot; and &quot;The Foundation&quot; she is seen smoking a Cuban cigar.

Jerry revealed in the episode, &quot;The Pilot&quot;, that Elaine&#x27;s favorite film is &quot;Shaft&quot;.

Elaine is a breathtakingly poor dancer. Her performance at a J. Peterman company party, the central plot theme of &quot;The Little Kicks&quot;, causes George to describe it as &quot;a full-bodied dry heave set to music.&quot; The moves are repeated in her bedroom in a short scene of &quot;The Slicer&quot;. Both clips appear in &quot;The Clip Show, Pt. 1&quot;.

=== Insecurities ===
In &quot;The Andrea Doria&quot;, Elaine dates Alan, a &quot;bad breaker-upper&quot;, who makes her feel insecure about having a big head. In the episode she describes herself as a &quot;walking candy apple&quot; after a bird flies into her &quot;giant, freak head.&quot;

In &quot;The Smelly Car&quot;, Elaine repulses her boyfriend Carl when her hair smells of body odor from riding in Jerry&#x27;s car. She goes to extreme lengths to get the smell out but nothing works, and he continues to be grossed out.

In &quot;The Postponement&quot;, Elaine confides in a rabbi that she is jealous of George&#x27;s engagement to Susan Ross because George would be getting married before her and she considers George a loser. The Rabbi proceeds to tell everybody in Elaine&#x27;s apartment complex and later on his cable TV show about her insecurity.

=== Influence/effect on others ===
In &quot;The Chinese Woman&quot;, Jerry describes how Elaine&#x27;s influence has had a destructive effect on her relationship with her friend Noreen. It is revealed that over the course of their friendship, Elaine has convinced Noreen to join the Army, then go AWOL, break up with one boyfriend for being a &quot;high-talker&quot;, then later break up with another for being a &quot;long-talker&quot;. Eventually, Kramer steps in and forbids Elaine to have any more contact with Noreen.

In &quot;The Muffin Tops&quot;, Elaine convinces her ex-boss Mr. Lippman to start his own business selling just &quot;muffin tops&quot;. However, they soon run into problems when no one will take the leftover stumps, and only by calling in &quot;The Cleaner&quot; (who turns out to be Newman) can they get rid of them.

In &quot;The Non-Fat Yogurt&quot;, Elaine suggests to Lloyd Braun, an advisor to Mayor David Dinkins, that everybody in the city should wear name tags. Lloyd Braun suggests this idea to the mayor, who likes it so much that he adds it to his campaign, subsequently leading to his loss in the mayoral elections. In &quot;The Gum&quot;, it&#x27;s revealed that Lloyd Braun also loses his job and later has a nervous breakdown.

== Romantic relationships ==
=== Jerry Seinfeld ===
Jerry and Elaine dated for a while before the show started. They started dating in 1986 (as revealed in &quot;The Truth&quot;) and dated until 1990. In &quot;The Deal&quot;, Elaine states they only had sex 37 times. In &quot;The Stakeout&quot;, Jerry tells his parents that the reason for the break-up had to do with fighting too much and &quot;physical chemistry&quot;.

In &quot;The Deal&quot;, Jerry and Elaine create a set of rules whereby they can be sexually intimate but remain only friends. However, their theory is ruined when Elaine is furious over Jerry giving her $182 as a birthday gift. In &quot;The Mango&quot;, Jerry is shocked to discover that Elaine had feigned her orgasms while they were together.

In &quot;The Serenity Now&quot;, Jerry&#x27;s uninhibited, exaggerated emotional state causes him to ask Elaine to marry him. Shocked, she makes an excuse and leaves. She returns later to accept his proposal, but Jerry has by that time settled to his usual stable emotional state and says &quot;I don&#x27;t see it happening.&quot; In &quot;The Finale&quot;, when they think their airplane is about to crash, Elaine says &quot;I&#x27;ve always loved y...&quot;, but the pilot is able to steady the airplane. Elaine later explained in court that she was going to say &quot;I&#x27;ve always loved United Airlines.&quot;

During her interview on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, Julia Louis-Dreyfus said she believed Jerry and Elaine were soul mates but would never end up together because they were both too &quot;insane and messed up.&quot;

In the reunion episode featured in Season 7 of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, it is revealed in the years since the finale Jerry has donated sperm to Elaine that results in her having a daughter, who has taken to calling Jerry &quot;Uncle Jerry&quot;, but by the episode&#x27;s end, it is said she now refers to him as &quot;daddy&quot; to Jerry and Elaine&#x27;s clear discomfort.

=== David Puddy ===
Elaine&#x27;s longest relationship, besides that with Jerry, is with David Puddy (Patrick Warburton), an auto mechanic turned car salesman. Elaine begins dating David in the latter half of Season 6, and later for the majority of Season 9. Puddy has a casual approach to their relationship as seen in &quot;The Voice&quot; when Puddy claims he just likes her for the sex. In the same episode, when Elaine tells him that they&#x27;re back together, he answers &quot;Oh, no&quot;. In &quot;The Finale&quot;, when Elaine is about to be taken away to prison, she emotionally tells Puddy to &quot;not wait for her&quot;. Puddy answers back with a simple, casual, &quot;Alright.&quot;

=== Other notable boyfriends ===
Elaine dates baseball player (and Kramer and Newman&#x27;s nemesis) Keith Hernandez in &quot;The Boyfriend&quot;.

Over several episodes in Season 4, she dates Joe Davola, who is—unbeknownst to Elaine—simultaneously stalking Jerry.

In &quot;The Sniffing Accountant&quot; she dates Jake Jarmel, an up-and-coming writer and star client of Pendant Publishing. She dumps him because of his reluctance to use exclamation points.

In &quot;The Non-Fat Yogurt&quot;, Elaine dates Lloyd Braun. Since Lloyd works for the mayor, she tells him that the city would be a better place if everybody wore name tags. He mentions this to the mayor, who eventually loses re-election as a result.

In &quot;The Masseuse&quot;, she dates a man named Joel Rifkin, who shares the same name as a notorious serial killer.

In &quot;The Stall&quot;, her boyfriend Tony, dubbed a male bimbo or &quot;mimbo&quot; by Jerry, becomes George&#x27;s new idol.

In &quot;The Maestro&quot;, Elaine starts dating Bob Cobb, a conductor who insists on being called &quot;Maestro&quot;. They eventually go to Tuscany together.

In &quot;The Bizarro Jerry&quot;, she dates Kevin, the nice, kind antithesis of Jerry whose friends Gene, Feldman and Vargas are polar opposites of George, Kramer and Newman, respectively, each described as coming from the backwards Bizarro World of Superman comics.

In &quot;The Checks&quot;, her boyfriend Brett is so obsessed with the song &quot;Desperado&quot; that she feels ignored whenever it comes on. She tries to find a song that they can share and comes up with &quot;Witchy Woman&quot;, but it does not work. Both songs are by the Eagles.

In &quot;The Junk Mail&quot;, Elaine dates Jack, the TV pitchman for The Wiz.

In &quot;The Wizard&quot;, Elaine is not sure if her new boyfriend Darryl is black or not and gets mixed signals when she tries to find out. It turns out he is white and he thought Elaine was Hispanic.

== Conflicts ==
In &quot;The Visa&quot; she and Jerry anger Pakistani immigrant Babu Bhatt after she fails to notice Babu&#x27;s visa application in Jerry&#x27;s mail that she is picking up for him.

In &quot;The Cigar Store Indian&quot;, Elaine angers Frank Costanza by taking his &quot;TV Guide&quot; without asking and then spilling her gyro on it. Then, in &quot;The Little Kicks&quot;, she and Frank come to blows after George is arrested along with Elaine&#x27;s coworker Anna. Elaine says to Frank, &quot;I could drop you like a bag of dirt.&quot; Frank replies, &quot;You want a piece of me? You got it.&quot; Later, when Jerry chides her for fighting with an old man, she says, &quot;Hey, he wrote the check. I cashed it.&quot;

In &quot;The Fire&quot;, Elaine reveals her hate for her overly energetic, always-happy colleague Toby. Then, when Toby loses her pinky toe in an accident (caused by Jerry), an outpouring of office sympathy leads Toby to a major promotion instead of the more qualified Elaine.

Elaine&#x27;s abortion argument with restaurateur Poppie gets him so angry that he loses control of his bladder in &quot;The Couch&quot; and again in &quot;The Doorman&quot;.

In &quot;The Understudy&quot;, after she thinks her Korean manicurists are making fun of her, she angers them by bringing in Frank Costanza, who is fluent in Korean, to eavesdrop on them.

In &quot;The Soup Nazi&quot;, Elaine refuses to abide by the rules of a strict soup stand owner nicknamed &quot;The Soup Nazi&quot; and therefore becomes the subject of his ire. When she finds his secret recipes that he accidentally left in an armoire, she hints that she will drive him out of business, gloating that he&#x27;s &quot;through.&quot;

In &quot;The Package&quot;, it is revealed that Elaine&#x27;s medical charts characterize her as a &quot;difficult&quot; patient to such a degree that she cannot receive treatment for a rash because one doctor after another refuses to treat her.

In &quot;The Susie&quot;, co-worker Peggy tells Elaine — who she thinks is a woman named Susie — that Elaine is a &quot;dolt&quot; and &quot;disaster&quot;. Later, in &quot;The Apology&quot;, Peggy thinks Elaine has germs, and in retaliation Elaine intentionally coughs on Peggy&#x27;s doorknob, rubs her stapler in her armpit, and rubs her keyboard on her backside.

In &quot;The Summer of George&quot;, Elaine makes an enemy of her coworker Sam (Molly Shannon). First, when Elaine criticizes Sam&#x27;s way of walking (&quot;It&#x27;s like she&#x27;s carrying invisible suitcases&quot;), Sam gets furious and threatens revenge. Then, Raquel Welch (who was recently fired from a musical for dancing without swinging her arms), sees Elaine describing the walk to the police and thinks that Elaine is making fun of her and attacks her.

In &quot;The Betrayal&quot;, Elaine is so unhappy at receiving an &quot;unvitation&quot; (a deliberately last-minute invitation) to her frenemy Sue Ellen Mischke&#x27;s wedding that she travels all the way to India just to attend. At the wedding, George reveals that Elaine had once dated the groom, leading Sue Ellen to rip out Elaine&#x27;s nose-ring.

<doc id="207917" wikidata="Q3726681" url="?curid=207917" title="Eobaatar">
<text>Eobaatar is a genus of extinct mammal from the Lower Cretaceous of Mongolia, Spain and England. A member of the also extinct order Multituberculata, it lies within the suborder Plagiaulacida and family Eobaataridae. The genus &quot;Eobaatar&quot; was named by Kielan-Jaworowska Z., Dashzeveg D. and Trofimov B.A. in 1987. Its name was made from Greek &quot;eos&quot; = &quot;dawn&quot; and Mongolian &quot;baatar&quot; = &quot;hero&quot;&quot;, &quot;warrior&quot;.

==Species==
===&quot;Eobaatar hispanicus&quot;===
This species was named by Hahn G. and Hahn R. in 1992. Remains consisting of a single tooth were found in Hauterivian - Barremian (Lower Cretaceous)-age strata of the Camarillas Formation, Spain.

===&quot;Eobaatar magnus&quot;===
This species was named by Kielan-Jaworowska Z., Dashzeveg D. and Trofimov B.A. in 1987. It is based on a fragment of lower jaw with teeth found in Aptian or Albian (Lower Cretaceous) strata of the Dzunbain Formation in Guchin Us County, Mongolia, and had a cranial length of about 3 cm.

===&quot;Eobaatar minor&quot;===
This species was also named by Kielan-Jaworowska Z., Dashzeveg D. and Trofimov B.A. in 1987. Remains were found in Lower Cretaceous Dzunbain Formation of Mongolia. Going by the species name, it was probably relatively small; his skull was 2 cm in length indeed.

===&quot;Eobaatar pajaronensis&quot;===
This species was named by Hahn G. and Hahn R. in 2001. Remains were discovered in Barremian (Lower Cretaceous) strata of the Camarillas Formation in Spain.

===&quot;Eobaatar clemensi&quot;===
This species was named by Steven Sweetman in 2009. Remains were found in the Barremian (lower Cretaceous) of the Wessex formation, England.

<doc id="207923" wikidata="Q1263856" url="?curid=207923" title="Ari Fleischer">
<text>Lawrence Ari Fleischer (born October 13, 1960) is an American media consultant and political aide who served as the 23rd White House Press Secretary, for President George W. Bush, from January 2001 to July 2003.

As press secretary in the Bush administration, Fleischer was a prominent advocate for the invasion of Iraq. Since leaving the White House, he has worked as a media consultant and commentator. He joined Fox News as a contributor in July 2017.

==Early life==
Fleischer was born in 1960 in New York City, the son of Martha and Alan A. Fleischer. His mother was a database coordinator and his father was owner of an executive recruiting company. His parents were Jewish; his mother is a Hungarian immigrant who lost much of her family in the Holocaust. Both parents were Democrats who were &quot;horrified&quot; when Fleischer became a Republican, he told an interviewer in 2003: &quot;While I lived at home and when I started college, I was a liberal Democrat. In a sense, it was President Carter who drove me out of the Democratic Party and it was President Reagan who welcomed me into the Republican Party.&quot; He graduated from Fox Lane High School in Bedford, New York, in 1978, and graduated from Middlebury College in Vermont in 1982.

==Congressional staffer==
Upon his graduation from Middlebury, Fleischer worked as press secretary for Jon S. Fossel, a Republican candidate for a New York congressional seat. Later Fleischer worked as press secretary for Norman Lent. From 1985 to 1988, he was field director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. He went back to being a press secretary in 1988, working for congressman Joseph DioGuardi.

Fleischer served as U.S. Senator Pete Domenici&#x27;s press secretary from 1989 to 1994 and as spokesman for the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee for five years. He worked as deputy communications director for George H. W. Bush&#x27;s 1992 reelection campaign.

==White House press secretary==

Although Fleischer served as communications director for Elizabeth Dole during her presidential run in the 2000 election campaign, he joined George W. Bush&#x27;s presidential campaign after Dole dropped out of the race. When Bush became President in 2001, he tapped Fleischer to become his press secretary.

Fleischer is credited with introducing the phrase &quot;homicide bombing&quot; to describe what has also been called suicide bombing, in April 2002, to emphasize the tactic&#x27;s terrorist connotations:

On May 19, 2003, he announced that he would resign during the summer, citing a desire to spend more time with his wife and to work in the private sector. He was replaced by deputy press secretary Scott McClellan on July 15, 2003.

=== Iraq War ===
As press secretary in the Bush administration, Fleischer was a prominent advocate for the invasion of Iraq. He made numerous exaggerated and misleading claims about Iraq in the lead-up to the Iraq War, in particular about Iraq&#x27;s purported WMD program (it did not have one) and the Saddam Hussein regime&#x27;s purported relationship with al-Qaeda (they did not have an operational relationship). In January 2003, after UN weapons inspectors said they had &quot;not found any smoking gun&quot; evidence of an active WMD program, Fleischer said, &quot;The problem with guns that are hidden is you can&#x27;t see their smoke... We know for a fact that there are weapons there.&quot; (there were not) On the issue of whether the Saddam Hussein regime had sought to obtain uranium from Niger, Fleischer said that it was &quot;an issue that very well may be true. We don’t know if it’s true—but nobody, but nobody, can say it is wrong.&quot; In his press conferences, he repeatedly insisted that the burden of proof for the non-existence of the Hussein regime&#x27;s WMD program fell on Saddam Hussein, not on the Bush administration to prove that he did have an active WMD program. On one occasion Fleischer said that Hussein &quot;has to indicate whether or not he has weapons. . . . If he declares he has none, then we will know that Saddam Hussein is once again misleading the world... If Saddam Hussein indicates that he has weapons of mass destruction and that he is violating United Nations resolutions, then we will know that Saddam Hussein again deceived the world.&quot;

In 2019, Fleischer said, &quot;It’s a myth that Bush lied&quot; about Iraq, resulting in a backlash. Fleischer claimed that he and Bush &quot;faithfully and accurately reported&quot; the assessments of the Intelligence community. &quot;Operation Avarice&quot;, a covert Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operation to buy up WMD&#x27;s in Iraq, did secure over 400 missiles and rockets containing chemical weapons, mostly Sarin nerve-gas, between 2005 and 2006. In some cases the missile&#x27;s toxicity was over 25%, much higher than expected. Some details of the classified operation were revealed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2015. Additionally, hundreds and possibly thousands of US troops were exposed to various chemical weapons during cleanup operations when about 5,000 chemical warheads, shells or aviation bombs were located and demolished in Iraq. Some of the cases of exposure were hushed up at the time, as the military did not want to reveal that there were chemical agents around lest they be used by terrorists in conjunction with IEDs.

=== Torture ===
In 2003, Fleischer said, &quot;The standard for any type of interrogation of somebody in American custody is to be humane and to follow all international laws and accords dealing with this type subject. That is precisely what has been happening and exactly what will happen.&quot; The administration used waterboarding, sleep deprivation and forced nudity against suspected combatants and suspected terrorists.

In 2009, when the Department of Justice of the Obama administration launched a probe into alleged CIA interrogation abuses, Fleischer described the decision as &quot;disgusting.&quot; Fleischer said if he were subpoenaed in an investigation of alleged interrogation abuses, &quot;I&#x27;ll be proud to testify... I&#x27;m proud of what we did to protect this country.&quot;

==Alleged role in Plame affair==

Fleischer was an important figure in the Plame affair, which revolved around journalist Robert Novak&#x27;s public identification of Valerie Plame as a covert CIA officer in 2003. Fleischer testified that Scooter Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s then-chief of staff, told him that Valerie Plame was a CIA agent weeks before Libby had claimed to have been informed of Plame&#x27;s status by a reporter.

On July 7, 2003, in the James S. Brady Briefing Room, Fleischer was asked about Joseph Wilson, a former U.S. ambassador who had recently written an editorial for &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticizing the intelligence information the Bush administration had relied upon to make its case for invading the nation of Iraq. Specifically, Fleischer was asked to respond to Mr. Wilson&#x27;s assertion that he had been sent to Niger to investigate claims that Saddam Hussein had sought yellowcake uranium and found no evidence that such events had ever occurred.

Fleischer testified in open court on January 29, 2007, that Libby told him on July 7, 2003, at lunch, about Plame, who is Wilson&#x27;s wife. MSNBC correspondent David Shuster summarized Fleisher&#x27;s testimony on &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;:

Fleischer also testified to the fact that Dan Bartlett, the president&#x27;s communications adviser, told him the same thing on Air Force One days later on the way to Niger with President Bush. Fleischer had then relayed this information to &quot;Time&quot; correspondent John Dickerson and NBC&#x27;s David Gregory in Uganda during the African trip.

Dickerson denied that such a conversation ever took place. Fleischer gave his final &quot;Press Briefing&quot; on July 14, 2003.

On July 18, 2005, &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported that in his sworn testimony before the grand jury investigating the leak, Fleischer denied having seen a memo circulating in Air Force One on July 7, 2003, which named Plame in connection to Wilson&#x27;s mission and which identified her as a &quot;CIA&quot; covert agent. However, a former Bush Administration official also on the plane testified to having seen Fleischer perusing the document.

Columnist Robert Novak, who published Plame&#x27;s name on July 14, 2003, made a call to Fleischer on July 7, 2003, before Fleischer&#x27;s trip to Africa with President Bush. It is unclear whether Fleischer returned Novak&#x27;s call. However, Fleischer is mentioned in Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald&#x27;s indictment of Libby. The indictment states that Libby told Fleischer (referred to as the White House press secretary in the indictment) that Plame worked for the &quot;CIA&quot; and that this fact was not well known.

After receiving an immunity agreement, Fleischer testified that he had revealed Plame&#x27;s identity to reporters after learning it from Libby. However, in the end it was discovered that Richard Armitage first leaked Plame&#x27;s identity, not Libby or Cheney.

== Media bias ==
In his book &quot;Suppression, Deception, Snobbery, and Bias: Why the Press Gets So Much Wrong ― and Just Doesn&#x27;t Care&quot;, Fleischer argues that &quot;there&#x27;s a younger generation of journalists … who think their job is to be subjective&quot; and that &quot;They don&#x27;t believe in objectivity. They don&#x27;t believe in two sides. They believe that their side, particularly on social issues and on racial matters, is the only right side.&quot;

==Consultancy firm==
Today he works as a media consultant for various corporations and sports organizations and players through his company, Ari Fleischer Communications. He has consulted for former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper, Mark McGwire, the Washington Redskins, Tiger Woods and the Green Bay Packers.

He also worked with the Saudi Arabian LIV Golf Tour.

==Memoir==
In 2005, Fleischer published a memoir, &quot;Taking Heat: The President, the Press and My Years in the White House&quot;. Michiko Kakutani wrote in &quot;The New York Times,&quot; &quot;[T]his book does not provide any new insights into the workings of the current White House. It does not present compelling portraits of cabinet members or members of the White House supporting cast. And it does not shed new light on the president or his methods of governance.&quot; She found the book &quot;insular, defensive and wholly predictable.&quot; In Salon.com, Eric Boehlert declared that despite &quot;a few curious nuggets,&quot; the book is &quot;long on praise for his boss and criticism of the &#x27;liberal&#x27; media, and short on revelations.&quot;

<doc id="207925" wikidata="Q4905656" url="?curid=207925" title="Ethel Muggs">
<text>Ethel Muggs is a fictional character frequently featured in Archie Comics. She is a student of Riverdale High School, sometimes known to her schoolmates by the nickname Big Ethel, though this nickname has largely fallen out of use since the 1980s.

She was first drawn by cartoonist Samm Schwartz, probably modeled after a prototype designed by Bill Vigoda for a 1948 Archie Comics story. She has been voiced by Jane Webb, Jazzmin Lausanne, and Michele Phillips. Cindy Ambuehl played Ethel in the television film &quot;&quot;, and Shannon Purser portrays the character in a recurring capacity on The CW&#x27;s &quot;Riverdale&quot;. In Zoya Akhtar&#x27;s 2024 Teen Rom-Com movie adaptation of The Archies, which goes by the same name, she is played by actress Aditi Saigal.

==History and character==
Ethel Muggs (originally Ethel Dinklehof) was portrayed in the early era as a tall, gangly, plain-faced, somewhat boy-crazy young woman that had a huge infatuation with Jughead Jones. This was explained in her first appearance in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Pal, Jughead&quot; #84 as the result of Dilton Doiley&#x27;s &quot;Electronic Mate Selector&quot; selecting Jughead as &quot;the perfect mate&quot; for her. She usually resorted to devious means to get Jughead in her clutches, and would typically end up running after him. Ethel has also pursued Jughead by appealing to his appetite; the &quot;Betty and Veronica&quot; comic title often featured real recipes that Ethel used to make her way to Jughead&#x27;s heart through his stomach. Earlier issues featuring Big Ethel show her bearing a strong resemblance to Jughead, also, with her prominent nose, dark hair, and angular build. In the late 1980s, Ethel was occasionally drawn with braces on her buck teeth.

Although Ethel is usually portrayed as drab-looking and gawky, one story involving a makeover by Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge in an attempt to attract Jughead&#x27;s attention revealed her to be quite curvy and pretty (albeit still with buck teeth). Despite her new look, Jughead was as uninterested as ever.

In the later era, she has been portrayed as an average, decent-looking, somewhat likeable teen girl, whose infatuation for Jughead has been considerably toned down. She now has other interests that keep her mind from Jughead, including Dilton and Archie Andrews, to keep her company. This actually tends to make Jughead a bit jealous. She and Dilton share mutual sympathy due to their few successes with romantic relationships, which is one of the reasons that they occasionally date. She has even been on one memorable date with Archie in one story. That date showed another side of Ethel, where she was funny, smart and attractive. The same story also introduces Hank, a friend of Ethel&#x27;s who works at a local club Archie and Ethel visit on their date. It is later revealed that Hank was originally a pen pal of Ethel&#x27;s, and she sent him a picture of Veronica instead of herself because of her low self-esteem. When Hank met Veronica standing in as Ethel, he dumped her because of her vanity. He soon ran into the real Ethel, and told her she was the most exciting girl he has ever met, and that Veronica could not hold a candle to her. When she questions his sincerity, he replies that he does mean it, and she is even more beautiful than Veronica. In another story, a merman (temporarily transformed into a teenage human boy) finds her enchanting due to her inner beauty, giving her self-esteem a huge boost.

Although Jughead drives Ethel away when her affections are too obvious, he can often stand being around her when she keeps her calm. In a storyline that ran in &quot;Jughead&quot; in the early 1990s, Ethel told Jughead she is tired of chasing him, and begins a romantic relationship with Jeffrey, a blind boy. During this time, Jughead also had a semi-romantic relationship with Anita, a paraplegic African-American teen. Both Jughead and Ethel displayed jealousy at the others&#x27; relationship, but the storyline was eventually dropped.

Various stories depict Ethel as a fan of science fiction, art, and trains. She also has a talent for making doll-house furniture, and often works as a babysitter. She is also a fine cook, which is one of the reasons Jughead occasionally submits to being around her. She is fond of dogs, and sometimes uses her attractive female poodle, Clementine, as bait to lure Jughead and Hot Dog.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Afterlife with Archie&quot;===
In the second issue of the 2013 Archie Horror series &quot;Afterlife with Archie&quot;, Ethel attends the Halloween dance dressed as Snow White and after an attempted flirtation, a zombified Jughead bites and infects her. When the reanimated Ethel goes after Betty, Veronica blasts and hits the zombie with a fire extinguisher. When she doesn&#x27;t stay down, the kids realize that a zombie apocalypse is upon them.

===&quot;Archie&#x27;s R/C Racers&quot;===
In the &quot;Archie&#x27;s R/C Racers&quot; series (which takes place outside the regular Archie continuity), Ethel was a member of Archie&#x27;s team who was traveling across the United States racing radio-controlled cars. She was given her own subplot in the series when she chose to leave Archie&#x27;s team and join Babette and her henchmen, one of whom had a crush on Ethel and whose feelings were returned. They promised to help Ethel&#x27;s aspiring country music career. Gradually, she became a starlet, known as &quot;Ethel Sue&quot;.

Ethel eventually learned the truth about the trio when Babette convinced her to pose for some publicity photos. Standing in front of a large metal target, Ethel suddenly became strapped to the target and Babette prepared to shoot her with a ray gun, which Ethel believed was a camera. Babette explained that the ray gun was a device that can give the recipient mental powers and she planned on using it on herself after testing it on Ethel. Before she could be zapped, Archie&#x27;s team saved her. Babette instead zapped a tour guide, who became a villain in the series. Ethel left Babette and returned to Archie&#x27;s team.

===&quot;Life with Archie: The Married Life&quot;===
Ethel Muggs appears in &quot;Life with Archie: The Married Life&quot;.

===Prototypes===
An early unnamed prototype for the Big Ethel character drawn by Bill Vigoda appeared in &quot;Archie Comics&quot; #30 (1948). In the story &quot;Patch as Catch Can&quot;, Riverdale had a &quot;patch hop&quot;; the girl who could sew her patch on a boy&#x27;s clothes is his date for the dance. Archie was trying to avoid Betty. While running from her, he found a boy on a tandem, and jumps aboard. He soon realized the boy was actually a very unattractive girl, whom Archie referred to as a &quot;Zombie&quot;. Except for her freckles she looks exactly like Ethel with black hair in pigtails, a buck toothed smile, and a tall skinny figure. Archie jumped off the bike, and continued to dodge Betty throughout the story. In the end, he ended up strung from rope tied to a flagpole, and the &quot;Zombie&quot; returned and sewed a patch on Archie&#x27;s underwear. The story ended with Archie lying on the railroad tracks, saying &quot;It&#x27;s no use, Jug. This is a much easier way out.&quot;

There was also a later character similar to Ethel named Ophelia Glutenschnable. Ophelia was also tall, skinny and dark, but her hair was styled differently, her nose was much bigger, and she usually had no buck teeth. She relentlessly pursued Jughead and all the other boys. In contrast to later stories, Jughead willingly went on dates with Ophelia. In one gag, Archie asks Jughead why he asked Ophelia to the dance, and Jughead replies that she was different: &quot;She&#x27;s the only one who&#x27;ll go with me!&quot; Eventually, Ophelia was replaced by Big Ethel.

A separate and unrelated character named &quot;Big Ethel&quot; appeared in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Girls Betty and Veronica&quot; #95 (November 1963). This character is a plump, disheveled redhead who chased Jughead. Betty and Veronica gave her a makeover (secured by waist-slimming shapewear) that turned her into a voluptuous beauty; however, her makeover was undone after a sneeze caused the foundation garment to break and her hair and clothing to become a mess. In later reprint stories, the character is renamed &quot;Esmeralda&quot;.

==Titles==
Ethel has never had her own series, but has been a supporting character mainly in the various &quot;Jughead&quot; series, as well as some of the &quot;Betty&quot; series, as she has a close friendship with Betty Cooper. She also has solo stories in the various &quot;Archie&quot; anthology titles. In 1982, she co-starred in the Spire Christian Comics title &quot;Archie and Big Ethel&quot;.

In October 2021, a series created by Keryl Brown Ahmed and Siobhan was published on Webtoon under the name &quot;Archie Comics: Big Ethel Energy,&quot; in which Ethel is the main character of a future Riverdale where everyone has graduated since long.

===Television===

====Animated====
* Ethel made her television debut in the early Filmation Archie cartoons, most notably in the &quot;How to Catch a Man&quot; segments on &quot;Archie&#x27;s Funhouse&quot;, where she is voiced by Jane Webb. Webb went on to voice the character, among several others, in numerous Archie-based television projects from 1968 to 1977. 
* Ethel appears in &quot;The New Archies&quot;, voiced by Jazzmin Lausanne.
* Ethel appears sporadically in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot; voiced by Michele Phillips. This incarnation is visually based on older versions of the character, but like in the newer comics, she also has other interests, such as beekeeping and magic.

====Live-action====

* Ethel appears in the 1990 television film &quot;&quot;, where she is portrayed as an adult by Cindy Ambuehl. Ethel is now a gorgeous fashion model, having been a late bloomer, and still has a crush on Jughead Jones. By the end of the movie, Jughead and his son decide to stay in Riverdale so that he can pursue a relationship with Ethel.
* Ethel is portrayed by Shannon Purser in The CW television series &quot;Riverdale&quot;, which debuted in 2017. In the series, Ethel is not shown to be obsessed with Jughead and is actually good friends with his girlfriend, Betty Cooper, and later Veronica Lodge after their shared experiences with harassment by Chuck Clayton. However, in season 3, it is revealed that Ethel is infatuated with Jughead and even convinces him to kiss her while playing a game of Gryphons and Gargoyles.

<text>Tyrone Gabriel Martin (born June 5, 1930) is a retired United States Navy commander, and a naval historian, most notable as an authority on (&quot;Old Ironsides&quot;), of which he was the 58th commanding officer. Martin was born in Greenwich, Connecticut on 5 June 1930 and commissioned an officer through the NROTC in 1952. During his twenty-six years of navy service he commanded two destroyers on tours of duty off Korea and Vietnam finally becoming the commanding officer (captain) of &quot;Constitution&quot; on 6 August 1974. In July 1976, during the United States Bicentennial celebrations, Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, arrived for their state visit and privately toured the ship for approximately thirty minutes with Commander Martin and Secretary of the Navy J. William Middendorf. During the 1980s, he was a Senior Naval Science Instructor (SNSI) for the NJROTC program at Boston Technical High School.

During Martin&#x27;s tenure as Commanding Officer, several traditions were instituted that are still observed by the crew of &quot;Constitution&quot; such as the wearing of 1812 era uniforms and the practice of firing morning and sunset guns. &quot;Constitution&quot; received her first Meritorious Unit Commendation during his tour and Martin was the first Captain to be decorated for service since Charles Stewart. Martin turned over command of the ship to Commander Robert Leo Gillen on 30 June 1978. Now retired, Martin has written several books about &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;, as well as numerous articles on various aspects of the ship and her times, plus the &quot;Salty Talk&quot; column in the journal &quot;Naval History&quot;.

In 2019, the Naval Historical Foundation awarded Martin the Commodore Dudley W. Knox Naval History Lifetime Achievement Award.

<text>The IBM 700/7000 series is a series of large-scale (mainframe) computer systems that were made by IBM through the 1950s and early 1960s. The series includes several different, incompatible processor architectures. The 700s use vacuum-tube logic and were made obsolete by the introduction of the transistorized 7000s. The 7000s, in turn, were eventually replaced with System/360, which was announced in 1964. However the 360/65, the first 360 powerful enough to replace 7000s, did not become available until November 1965. Early problems with OS/360 and the high cost of converting software kept many 7000s in service for years afterward.

==Architectures==
The IBM 700/7000 series has six completely different ways of storing data and instructions:
*First scientific (36/18-bit words): 701 (Defense Calculator)
*Later scientific (36-bit words, hardware floating-point): 704, 709, 7040, 7044, 7090, 7094
*Commercial (variable-length character strings): 702, 705, 7080
*1400 series (variable-length character strings): 7010
*Decimal (10-digit words, hardware floating-point): 7070, 7072, 7074
*Supercomputer (64-bit words, hardware floating-point): 7030 &quot;Stretch&quot;

The 700 class machines use vacuum tubes; the 7000 class machines are transistorized. All machines (like most other computers of the time) use magnetic-core memory; except for early 701 and 702 models, which initially used Williams tube CRT memory and were later converted to magnetic-core memory.

===Software compatibility issues===
Early computers were sold without software. As operating systems began to emerge, having four different mainframe architectures plus the IBM 1400 midline architectures became a major problem for IBM since it meant at least four different programming efforts were required.

The System/360 combines the best features of the 7000 and 1400 series architectures into a single design both for commercial computing and for scientific and engineering computing. However, its architecture is not compatible with those of the 7000 and 1400 series, so some 360 models have optional features that allow them to emulate the 1400 and 7000 instruction sets in microcode. One of the selling points of the System/370, the successor of the 360 introduced in mid-1970, was improved 1400/7000 series emulation, which could be done under operating system control rather than shutting down and restarting in emulation mode as was required for emulation of 7040/44, 7070/72/74, 7080 and 7090/94 on all of the 360s except the 360/85.

===Peripherals===
While the architectures differ, the machines in the same class use the same electronics technologies and generally use the same peripherals. Tape drives generally use 7-track format, with the IBM 727 for vacuum tube machines and the 729 for transistor machines. Both the vacuum tube and most transistor models use the same card readers, card punches, and line printers that were introduced with the 701. These units, the IBM 711, 721, and 716, are based on IBM accounting machine technology and even include plugboard control panels. They are relatively slow and it was common for 7000 series installations to include an IBM 1401, with its much faster peripherals, to do card-to-tape and tape-to-line-printer operations off-line. Three later machines, the 7010, the 7040 and the 7044, adopted peripherals from the midline IBM 1400 series. Some of the technology for the 7030 was used in data channels and peripheral devices on other 7000 series computers, e.g., 7340 Hypertape.

== First scientific architecture (701)==


Known as the Defense Calculator while in development in the IBM Poughkeepsie Laboratory, this machine was formally unveiled April 7, 1953 as the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine.

;Data formats
Numbers are either 36 bits or 18 bits long, only fixed point.
*Fixed-point numbers are stored in binary sign/magnitude format.

;Instruction format
Instructions are 18 bits long, single address.
*Sign (1 bit) – Whole-word (-) or Half-word (+) operand address
*Opcode (5 bits) – 32 instructions
*Address (12 bits) – 4096 Half-word addresses

To expand the memory from 2048 to 4096 words, a 33rd instruction was added that uses the most-significant bit of its address field to select the bank. (This instruction was probably created using the &quot;No OP&quot; instruction, which appears to have been the only instruction with unused bits, as it originally ignored its address field. However, documentation on this new instruction is not currently available.)

;Registers
Processor registers consisted of:
*AC  – 38-bit Accumulator
*MQ – 36-bit Multiplier-Quotient

;Memory
2,048 or 4,096 – 36-bit binary words with six-bit characters

== Later scientific architecture (704/709/7090/7094)==
IBM&#x27;s 36-bit scientific architecture was used for a variety of computation-intensive applications. First machines were the vacuum-tube 704 and 709, followed by the transistorized 7090, 7094, 7094-II, and the lower-cost 7040 and 7044. The ultimate model was the Direct Coupled System (DCS) consisting of a 7094 linked to a 7044 that handled input and output operations.

;Data formats
Numbers are 36 bits long, for both fixed-point arithmetic and floating-point arithmetic.
*Fixed-point numbers are stored in binary sign/magnitude format.
*Single-precision floating-point numbers have a magnitude sign, an 8-bit excess-128 exponent and a 27-bit magnitude
*Double-precision floating-point numbers, introduced on the 7094, have a magnitude sign, a 17-bit excess-65536 exponent, and a 54-bit magnitude
*Alphameric characters are 6-bit BCD, packed six to a word.

;Instruction format
The basic instruction format is a three-bit &quot;prefix&quot;, fifteen-bit &quot;decrement&quot;, three-bit &quot;tag&quot;, and fifteen-bit &quot;address&quot;. The prefix field specifies the class of instruction. The decrement field often contains an immediate operand to modify the results of the operation, or is used to further define the instruction type. The three bits of the tag specify three (seven in the 7094) &quot;index registers&quot;, the contents of which are subtracted from the address to produce an &quot;effective address&quot;. The address field either contains an address or an immediate operand.

;Registers

Processor registers consisted of:
*AC  – 38-bit Accumulator
*MQ – 36-bit Multiplier-Quotient
*XR  – 15-bit Index Registers (three or seven)
*SI    – 36-bit Sense Indicator

The accumulator (and multiplier-quotient) registers operate in sign/magnitude format. The accumulator has two overflow bits, labelled Q and P. Logical instructions clear or ignore S and Q; the Add and Carry Logical (ACL) instruction does an end-around carry from bit P to bit 35. 

The Index registers operate using two&#x27;s complement format and when used to modify an instruction address are subtracted from the address in the instruction. On machines with three index registers, if the tag has two or three bits set (i.e. selected multiple registers) then their values are ORed together before being subtracted. The IBM 7094, with seven index registers, powers up in &quot;multiple tag mode&quot; for compatibility with earlier machines, so that programs that used this trick could continue to be used; the &quot;Leave Multiple Tag Mode&quot; (LMTM) instruction turns that mode off, so that the tag specifies which of the index registers to use, and the &quot;Enter Multiple Tag Mode&quot; (EMTM) instruction turns it back on.

The Sense Indicators permit interaction with the operator via panel switches and lights.

;Memory
*704: 4,096 or 8,192 or 32,768 – 36-bit binary words with six-bit characters
*709, 7090, 7094, 7094 II, 7040, 7044: 32,768 – 36-bit binary words with six-bit characters
;Input/output
The 709/7090 series use Data Synchronizer Channels for high-speed input/output, such as tape and disk. The basic 7-bit DSCs, e.g., 7607, execute their own simple programs from the computer memory that controls the transfer of data between memory and the I/O devices; the more advanced 9-bit 7909 supports more sophisticated channel programs. Because the unit record equipment on the 709x was so slow, punched card I/O and high-speed printing were often performed by transferring magnetic tapes to and from an off-line IBM 1401. Later, the data channels were used to connect a 7090 to a 7040 or a 7094 to a 7044 to form the IBM 7094/7044 Direct Coupled System (DCS). In that configuration, the 7044, which could use faster 1400 series peripherals, primarily handled I/O.

===FORTRAN assembly program===
The FORTRAN Assembly Program (FAP) is an assembler for the 709, 7090, and 7094, originally written at the Western Data Processing Center by David E. Ferguson and Donald P. Moore for the 709. It runs under IBM&#x27;s Fortran Monitor System (FMS) and IBSYS operating systems. An earlier assembler was SHARE Compiler-Assembler-Translator (SCAT) under SHARE Operating System (SOS). Macros were added to FAP by Bell Laboratories (BE-FAP), and the final 7090/7094 assembler was Macro Assembly Program (IBMAP), under IBSYS/IBJOB. SCAT, FAP and MAP were mutually incompatible.

Its pseudo-operation &quot;BSS&quot;, used to reserve memory, is the origin of the common name of the &quot;BSS section&quot;, still used in many assembly languages today for designating reserved memory address ranges of the type not having to be saved in the executable image.

== Commercial architecture (702/705/7080)==
The IBM 702 and IBM 705 are similar, and the 705 can run many 702 programs without modification, but they are not completely compatible.

The IBM 7080 is a transistorized version of the 705, with various improvements. For backward compatibility it can be run in &quot;705 I&quot; mode, &quot;705 II&quot; mode, &quot;705 III&quot; mode, or full 7080 mode.

;Data format
Data is represented by a variable-length string of characters terminated by a Record mark.

;Instruction format
Five characters: one character opcode and four character address – OAAAA

;Registers
*702
**two Accumulators (A &amp; B) – 512 characters
*705
**one Accumulator – 256 characters
**14 auxiliary storage units – 16 characters
**one auxiliary storage unit – 32 characters
*7080
**one Accumulator – 256 characters
**30 auxiliary storage units – 512 characters
**32 communication storage units – 8 characters

;Memory
*702
**2,000 to 10,000 characters in Williams tubes (in increments of 2,000 characters)
**Character cycle rate – 23 microseconds
*705 (models I, II, or III)
**20,000 or 40,000 or 80,000 characters of core memory
**Character cycle rate – 17 microseconds or 9.8 microseconds
*7080
**80,000 or 160,000 characters of Core memory
**Character cycle rate – 2.18 microseconds

;Input/output
The 705 and the basic 7080 use channels with a 7-bit interface. The 7080 can be equipped with 7908 data channels to attach faster devices using a 9-bit interface.

== 1400 series architecture (7010)==

The 700/7000 commercial architecture inspired the very successful IBM 1400 series of mid-sized business computers. In turn, IBM later introduced a mainframe version of the IBM 1410 called the IBM 7010.

;Data format
*Data is represented by a variable length string of characters terminated by a word mark.

;Instruction format
*Variable length: 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, or 12 characters.

;Registers
Fifteen five-character fields in fixed locations in low memory can be treated as index registers, whose values can be added to the address specified in an instruction. Also, certain internal registers that would today be invisible, such as the addresses of the characters being currently processed, are exposed to the programmer; in particular, the B address register is often used for subroutine linkage.

;Memory
*100,000 characters

== Decimal architecture (7070/7072/7074)==

The IBM 7070, IBM 7072, and IBM 7074 are decimal, fixed-word-length machines. They use a ten-digit word like the smaller and older IBM 650, but are not instruction set compatible with the 650.

;Data format
*Word length – 10 decimal digits plus sign
*Digit encoding – two-out-of-five code
*Floating point – optional, with a two-digit exponent
*Three signs for each word – Plus, Minus, and Alpha
**Plus and Minus indicate 10-digit numeric values
**Alpha indicates five characters of text coded by pairs of digits. 61 = A, 91 = 1.

;Instruction format
*All instructions use one word
*Two-digit opcode (including sign, Plus or Minus only)
*Two-digit index register
*Two-digit field control – allows selecting sets of digits, shifting left or right
*Four-digit address

;Registers
*All registers use one word and can also be addressed as memory.
*Accumulators – three (addresses 9991, 9992, and 9993 – standard; 99991, 99992, and 99993 – extended 7074)
*Program register – one (address 9995 – standard; 99995 – extended 7074)
**Addressable from console only. Stores current instruction.
*Instruction counter – one (address 9999 – standard; 99999 – extended 7074)
**Addressable from console only
*Index registers – 99 (addresses 0001-0099)

;Memory
*5000 to 9990 words (standard)
*15000 to 30000 words (extended 7074)
*Access time – 6 microseconds (7070/7072), 4 microseconds (7074)
*Add time – 72 microseconds (7070), 12 microseconds (7072), 10 microseconds (7074)

;Input/output
The 707x uses channels with a 7-bit interface. The 7070 and 7074 can be equipped with 7907 data channels to attach faster devices using a 9-bit interface.

==Timeline==
An IBM 7074 was used by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in 1962.

The IBM 7700 Data Acquisition System is not a member of the IBM 7000 series, despite its number and its announcement date of December 2, 1963.

==Performance==
All of the 700 and 7000 series machines predate standard performance measurement tools such as the Whetstone (1972), Dhrystone (1984), LINPACK (1979), or Livermore loops (1986) benchmarks.

In the table below, the Gibson and Knight measurements report speed, where higher numbers are better; the TRIDIA measurement reports time, where lower numbers are better.

<doc id="207929" wikidata="Q5092694" url="?curid=207929" title="Cheryl Blossom">
<text>Cheryl Marjorie Blossom is a fictional character of the Archie Comics universe. She is a wealthy and powerful teenage girl, the privileged daughter of a businessman. She is portrayed by Madelaine Petsch in &quot;Riverdale&quot; and Diya Gupta in &quot;The Archies&quot;.

==History and character==
Cheryl Blossom was introduced in 1982 in &quot;Betty and Veronica #320&quot; as a third love interest for Archie Andrews, but she and her twin brother Jason disappeared two years later.

In the 1980s, when a number of alternate universe series were published, Cheryl was a minor recurring character in the short-lived title &quot;Archie&#x27;s Explorers of the Unknown&quot;. She appeared as Blaze Blossom and would brief the Explorers on their missions.

The character was reintroduced into the main continuity and Archie Andrews&#x27; life during the &quot;Love Showdown&quot; four-part series in 1994. During the series, Archie receives a letter from Cheryl which states she will be returning to Riverdale. Archie, infatuated with girls as always, decides to keep Cheryl&#x27;s return a secret from Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge. He merely acts in a typical Archie girl crush maneuver (looking dreamy, uttering nonsense). Unknown to Archie is that Betty and Veronica both think the other person did this to Archie, and they declare war on each other to win back Archie once and for all. Super Soakers, dirty dancing, and fraud are just some of the tactics that the girls use on each other. Cheryl returns to Riverdale, leaving readers wondering whom Archie will choose in the end.

Cheryl has appeared in several comic book stories over the years, including her own series. In one story, it was revealed that an ancestor of Archie once fell in love with an ancestor of Cheryl&#x27;s back in Scotland. In another story, she decides to join a band titled &quot;The Sugar Girls&quot;, (a spoof of the popular band &quot;The Spice Girls&quot;) because Ginger Sugar had quit the group. In most stories, Cheryl behaves in a way that reflects her wealth and upbringing. She is very proud of her wealth and occasionally squabbles with Veronica over who leads the more extravagant lifestyle. She can be selfish and manipulative, sometimes plotting to lure Archie away from Betty and Veronica. There are stories where Cheryl is rude and condescending to the Riverdale &quot;townies,&quot; and sometimes only appearing as an antagonist to Betty and Veronica. Other times, particularly in the stories in her eponymous series, Cheryl can be kind and caring. She cares for her dog, a Pomeranian named Sugar, and rescues animals in need. In stories featuring Betty, Veronica, and Cheryl, Cheryl is usually the most adventurous. Cheryl is popular within her Pembrooke crowd and popular with the boys in Riverdale, but loathed by the girls for her flirtatious nature, her manipulations and her attractiveness.

Cheryl Blossom was ranked 92nd in &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;″s &quot;100 Sexiest Women in Comics&quot; list.

==Friends and family==

Cheryl has a twin brother, Jason, an arrogant rival of Archie. Jason is smitten with Betty Cooper, despite claiming that he only dates rich girls. Cheryl has never complained about his choice of girls. She often shows full support towards her brother, although sometimes, she warns Betty about Jason&#x27;s womanizing behavior.

At one point, in the story &quot;Undercover Blossom&quot;, Cheryl decided that she would try to get into Riverdale High under false pretenses. She chose the alias &quot;Shirley Merriwether&quot;; at first nobody thought anything amiss, until she decided to cause trouble, (i.e., sending fake love letters; and stealing a couple of term papers) and then she&#x27;d frame Archie for it, almost turning his friends against him. She had almost succeeded in destroying their friendship forever, but was thwarted when Mr. Weatherbee discovered her fraudulent enrollment papers. At a dance, the following evening, Cheryl&#x27;s parents, who had been informed of her deceit by Mr. Weatherbee, exposed the entire scam to Cheryl&#x27;s embarrassment. Her punishment was that she would attend Riverdale High. Her parents thought that since she got in by less than honest means, she would stay there and finish out her school year there.
Betty became Cheryl&#x27;s best friend in the three-part story and loved her dearly. &quot;Friendly Fire&quot; in an issue of Cheryl&#x27;s title series after Veronica humiliated Cheryl on Betty and Veronica&#x27;s local public-access television cable TV show, which alienated Betty from Veronica. Veronica, for no other reason than missing Betty&#x27;s friendship, eventually very publicly apologized to Cheryl, winning back Betty&#x27;s friendship in the process. Cheryl was shown to still be friends with Betty in a later issue, inviting Betty over to her house. It is unclear how much Archie writers other than Holly Golightly (the writer of &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;) portrayed Betty and Cheryl as friends, but a story in &quot;Archie &amp; Friends&quot; in early 2006 involves Betty suggesting that she, Veronica, and Cheryl go to Pop Tate&#x27;s Chock&#x27;lit Shoppe and hang out. Veronica and Cheryl accept and walk off with Betty, indicating that Betty and Cheryl are still friends.

In the late 1990s, Cheryl began dating Dilton Doiley. They were paired together online, without knowing each other&#x27;s true identity, fell in love, met in real life, and decided to continue their romantic relationship, though this was largely ignored in later stories.

At one point, Reggie and Cheryl started dating because they both had devilish minds and were very alike. Their relationship was unsuccessful, so Cheryl appeared on a dating show. In a reader-poll event, Archie Comics finally gave Cheryl a new boyfriend, with readers voting on the potential boyfriends featured on the show: blond-haired fitness-guru Austin, dark-complected computer genius Brandon, and shaved-headed gourmet chef George. The winner of the &#x27;contest&#x27; was George.

Raj Patel&#x27;s younger sister Tina Patel, who was introduced to &quot;Archie&quot; Comics in 2007, has been written into the CW television series &quot;Riverdale&quot;, which is described as a subversive take on the &quot;Archie&quot; comics and the characters. Tina Patel is cast as one of Cheryl Blossom&#x27;s best friends.

==Pembrooke==

Cheryl and Jason lived in the neighboring, upscale community of Pembrooke during her second stay in the comic books, which lasted until the quiet cancellation of her title series and her subsequent move to Paris. However, Cheryl was soon brought back by popular demand from her fans. Cheryl now lives in Riverdale, and no longer attends Pembrooke, although in some stories she and her brother return to visit friends there. (After her family almost lost all their wealth in one story, the Blossom family decide to make their son and daughter attend Riverdale High for the same reasons that the Lodge family make Veronica attend public school instead of private school).

Pembrooke Academy is the local private school in Pembrooke. The students who attend are frequently portrayed as antagonists to Riverdale High School, often disdaining Riverdale students as &quot;townies.&quot; The Blossom twins are the only students who openly date Riverdale &quot;townies,&quot; a practice that most Pembrooke students find barely tolerable were it not for the Blossom twins&#x27; wealth and popularity.

Pembrooke Academy&#x27;s athletics were not above using unfair tactics such as sabotage to win a competition. In many stories that feature a rivalry between Riverdale and Pembrooke, Pembrooke often loses despite their attempts to cheat to victory, or the two teams decide to come to a truce.

==Other versions==

Cheryl appears twice in the 2000–2002 &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot; comic series, despite not appearing in the TV series of the same name.

She was seen as a washed-up actress waiting tables in Los Angeles. It was revealed that her parents cut her off financially because they disapproved of her moving there to become an actress. Her brother, Jason, was revealed to be working for Mr. Lodge.

Cheryl returned to &quot;Life with Archie&quot; in issue 21 (July 2012).

===Television===

Cheryl Blossom appears in The CW&#x27;s teen drama series &quot;Riverdale&quot; as a series regular, played by Madelaine Petsch. She is the first character to appear on &quot;Chapter One: The River&#x27;s Edge&quot;. She is portrayed as the most popular girl at Riverdale High School, a &quot;rich, entitled, and manipulative girl who recently lost her twin brother by being shot in the head by their own father.&quot; She is also the daughter of Penelope and Clifford Blossom, who operate Blossom Maple Farms, which produces the town&#x27;s main export, maple syrup, amongst other things, and niece to Claudius Blossom, Clifford&#x27;s twin brother. It is revealed that her parents&#x27; constant emotional abuse among other traumas is the main cause of her mental instability, which leads to her attempting suicide &amp; attempted murder of her mother in season one. In the second season, her mother forces her into conversion therapy at an institution called &quot;The Sisters of Quiet Mercy&quot;, namely due to her attraction towards other girls, mainly Josie McCoy. After escaping, Cheryl begins a relationship with Toni Topaz, thus joining the Southside Serpents gang in the season finale. Cheryl and Toni then proceed to move in together at Thistlehouse, the Blossom residence. In season three, her relationship with Toni progresses further, and she is confirmed as a lesbian. After being kicked out of the Serpents by Jughead, Cheryl thanks Toni for being the best girlfriend ever with a new gang, called the Pretty Poisons. After Cheryl breaks up with Toni, she stars in the high school musical production as Heather Chandler in &quot;Heathers&quot;. Cheryl and Toni later get back together, but no sooner than that does she join The Farm, which is really an organ harvesting cult. Soon after her joining, Betty warns her about it. Cheryl saves Toni, but is still trapped there. While trying to break free she finds her dead brother Jason&#x27;s body at the farm. Alice Cooper helps Cheryl escape and meet up with Toni. Meanwhile, Veronica, Archie, and Betty are all being tortured and nearly killed by Penelope Blossom, Cheryl&#x27;s mother. Cheryl and Toni round up the Pretty Poisons and Serpents to save their friends. In the fourth season, Toni and Cheryl continue their relationship. Veronica and Cheryl start their own rum business called Maple Rum, run in an old brothel club that Penelope Blossom used to run. After visiting Ms. Burble, the guidance counselor, and expressing all of her feelings including that she has her dead brother&#x27;s body in her basement and is being haunted by a doll, she is replaced by a coach on the cheerleading squad.

<text>Il Dottore (; ), most commonly known in Italian as &quot;Dottor Balan&quot; or simply &quot;Balanzone&quot; (; Bolognese ), is a commedia dell&#x27;arte stock character, in one scenario being an obstacle to young lovers. Il Dottore and Pantalone are the comic foils of each other, Pantalone being the decadent wealthy merchant, and il Dottore being the decadent erudite. He has been part of the main canon of characters since the mid-16th century.

==Overview==
Il Dottore was born in the city of Bologna, Italy. He is comically inept. He is usually extremely rich, although the needs of the scenario might have things otherwise, and extremely pompous, loving the sound of his own voice and spouting ersatz Latin and Greek, il Dottore is known to be overly self loving and greedy. His interaction in the play is usually mostly with Pantalone, either as a friend, mentor or competitor.

==History==
Il Dottore first originated as the comic foil of Pantalone. The character has his performance origins in the year 1560 with the actor Lucio Burchiella; two other mentions follow soon after, with a pair of being mentioned in the year 1565, and another mention of &quot;Dottore Gracian&quot; in 1574. Since his introduction, he has existed in some form or other due to his popularity and interactions with Pantalone; however, his popularity did wane in Italy by the 1800s. He has gone by many names besides il Dottore, those being &quot;Dottore Gratiano&quot;, &quot;Dottore Baloardo&quot; (&quot;Dr. Dolt&quot;), &quot;Dottore Spaccastrummolo&quot; (&quot;Dr. Hack-and-Bandage&quot;), &quot;Dottore Scarpazon&quot;, and &quot;Dottore Forbizone&quot; (&quot;Dr. Large Scissor&quot;). His many names reflect his buffoonish nature, and call attention to his positive traits. Il Dottore migrates to France with the Gelosi troupe during the year 1572, still performed by Lucio Burchiella. Since commedia dell&#x27;arte performers were itinerant by nature, it is only natural that his character was transplanted to other countries. By the late 17th century, il Dottore was firmly embedded in the public eye, as evidenced by the playwright Molière&#x27;s inclusion of a Docteur-style character in his play &quot;&quot;. In contemporary media, il Dottore can be found in many common characters, such as Sheldon from &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; and Dr. Zoidberg from &quot;Futurama&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Rotund, il Dottore is fond of drink and food, but he loves chocolate the most. Il Dottore is also fond of girls. However, he is untruthful and gets caught cheating several times; he is a love rat. Il Dottore is representative of the learned intellectual class, and as such is meant to playfully parody the educated elite. He attended the University of Bologna, and pretends to be an expert in many subjects, talking constantly, but usually having no idea about that of which he speaks. Depending on the portrayal, however, he can actually be very educated, and bore the other players into leaving the stage. The preferred crowd favorite, however, is il Dottore who speaks nonsense. Il Dottore walks with his chest up, knees bent, and with a bouncy movement, taking small steps; he gesticulates with his hands and fingers, making room around him by keeping others at bay. He stands in one position and plants himself to make a point. Il Dottore can be the father to one of the &quot;innamorati&quot;, usually either Columbine or Isabella. There are, however, existing scenarios in which il Dottore is not a father, specifically &quot;the Tooth-Puller&quot;, or il Cavadente. There is also precedence for il Dottore to be cuckolded.
==Mask and costume==
Unlike the majority of half masks in commedia dell&#x27;arte, il Dottore&#x27;s mask is unique in that it is a one-third mask; the mask itself is meant to be a parody of a Bolognese jurisconsult. The actor&#x27;s cheeks may sometimes have rouge applied to imply that il Dottore is fond of drinking. His costume is usually all or mostly black and he frequently wears a black felt hat with long, trailing robes. Under his black robes are shorter black robes and black shoes. The ruff around il Dottore&#x27;s neck didn&#x27;t come into play until his popularity in France grew, at which point it was adopted in 1653 by Agostino Lolli.

==&quot;Balanzoni&quot; (type of pasta)==

&quot;Balanzoni&quot; is a type of pasta originating in the Italian city of Bologna, named after the renowned Bolognese mask. This fresh green pasta, colored by spinach in the dough, resembles tortellini in shape and is filled with ricotta and mortadella, leading some to call them &quot;tortelli matti&quot; (). The recipe for this dish is relatively recent, dating back to the latter half of the 20th century. It is said that in the post-World War II era, when household economy was crucial and minimizing waste was essential, an enterprising pasta maker used leftover green lasagna dough to create tortelli filled with available kitchen ingredients (ricotta and mortadella). The new pasta shape was named &quot;balanzoni&quot; to highlight its quintessential Bolognese essence, given its tortellini-like form, green lasagna color, and the use of mortadella, Bologna&#x27;s most typical sausage.

<doc id="207940" wikidata="Q977890" url="?curid=207940" title="Dick Turpin">
<text>Richard Turpin (bapt. 21 September 1705 – 7 April 1739) was an English highwayman whose exploits were romanticised following his execution in York for horse theft. Turpin may have followed his father&#x27;s trade as a butcher early in his life but, by the early 1730s, he had joined a gang of deer thieves and, later, became a poacher, burglar, horse thief, and killer. He is also known for a fictional overnight ride from London to York on his horse Black Bess, a story that was made famous by the Victorian novelist William Harrison Ainsworth almost 100 years after Turpin&#x27;s death.

Turpin&#x27;s involvement in the crime with which he is most closely associated—highway robbery—followed the arrest of the other members of his gang in 1735. He then disappeared from public view towards the end of that year, only to resurface in 1737 with two new accomplices, one of whom Turpin may have accidentally shot and killed. Turpin fled from the scene and shortly afterwards killed a man who attempted his capture.

Later that year, he moved to Yorkshire and assumed the alias of John Palmer. While he was staying at an inn, local magistrates became suspicious of &quot;Palmer&quot; and made enquiries as to how he funded his lifestyle. Suspected of being a horse thief, &quot;Palmer&quot; was imprisoned in York Castle, to be tried at the next assizes. Turpin&#x27;s true identity was revealed by a letter he wrote to his brother-in-law from his prison cell, which fell into the hands of the authorities. On 22 March 1739, Turpin was found guilty on two charges of horse theft and sentenced to death. He was hanged at Knavesmire on 7 April 1739.

Turpin became the subject of legend after his execution, romanticised as dashing and heroic in English ballads and popular theatre of the 18th and 19th centuries and in film and television of the 20th century.

== Early life ==

Richard (Dick) Turpin was born at the Blue Bell Inn (later the Rose and Crown) in Hempstead, Essex, the fifth of six children to John Turpin and Mary Elizabeth Parmenter. He was baptised on 21 September 1705, in the same parish where his parents had been married more than ten years earlier.

Turpin&#x27;s father was a butcher and innkeeper. Several stories suggest that Dick Turpin may have followed his father into these trades; one hints that, as a teenager, he was apprenticed to a butcher in the village of Whitechapel, while another proposes that he ran his own butcher&#x27;s shop in Thaxted. Testimony from his trial in 1739 suggests that he had a rudimentary education and, although no records survive of the date of the union, that in about 1725 he married Elizabeth Millington. Following his apprenticeship they moved north to Buckhurst Hill, Essex, where Turpin opened a butcher&#x27;s shop.

==Essex gang==
Turpin most likely became involved with the Essex gang of deer thieves in the early 1730s. Deer poaching had long been endemic in the Royal Forest of Waltham, and in 1723 the Black Act (so called because it outlawed the blackening or disguising of faces while in the forests) was enacted to deal with such problems. Deer stealing was a domestic offence that was judged not in civil courts, but before justices of the peace; it was not until 1737 that the more severe penalty of seven years&#x27; transportation was introduced. However, in 1731 seven verderers became so concerned by the increase in activity that they signed an affidavit which demonstrated their worries. The statement was lodged with the Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State, who responded by offering a reward to anyone who helped identify the thieves, plus a pardon for those thieves who gave up their colleagues. Following a series of nasty incidents, including the threatened murder of a keeper and his family, in 1733 the government increased the reward to .

The Essex gang (sometimes called the Gregory Gang), which included Samuel Gregory, his brothers Jeremiah and Jasper, Joseph Rose, Mary Brazier (the gang&#x27;s fence), John Jones, Thomas Rowden and a young John Wheeler, needed contacts to help them to dispose of the deer. Turpin, a young butcher who traded in the area, almost certainly became involved with their activities. By 1733 the changing fortunes of the gang may have prompted him to leave the butchery trade, and he became the landlord of a public house, most likely the Rose and Crown at Clay Hill. Although there is no evidence to suggest that Turpin was directly involved in the thefts, by summer 1734 he was a close associate of the gang, which may indicate that he had been known to them for some time.

By October 1734 several in the gang had either been captured or had fled, and the remaining members moved away from poaching, raiding the home of a chandler and grocer named Peter Split, at Woodford. Although the identities of the perpetrators are unknown, Turpin may have been involved. Two nights later they struck again, at the Woodford home of a gentleman named Richard Woolridge, a Furnisher of Small Arms in the Office of Ordnance at the Tower of London. In December Jasper and Samuel Gregory, John Jones, and John Wheeler, attacked the home of John Gladwin (a higler) and John Shockley, in Chingford. On 19 December Turpin and five other men raided the home of Ambrose Skinner, a 73-year-old farmer from Barking, leaving with an estimated .

Two days later, the gang—minus Turpin—attacked the home of a Keeper, William Mason, at Epping Forest. During the robbery Mason&#x27;s servant managed to escape, and returned about an hour later with several neighbours, by which time the house was ransacked and the thieves long gone. On 11 January 1735 the gang raided the Charlton home of a Mr. Saunders. For the robbery of a gentleman named Sheldon, one week later at Croydon, Turpin arrived masked and armed with pistols, with four other members of the gang. In the same month two men, possibly from the same gang, raided the home of a Reverend Mr. Dyde. The clergyman was absent but the two cut his manservant around the face &quot;in a barbarous manner&quot;. Another brutal attack occurred on 1 February 1735 at Loughton:

The gang lived in or around London. For a time Turpin stayed at Whitechapel, before moving to Millbank. On 4 February 1735 he met John Fielder, Samuel Gregory, Joseph Rose, and John Wheeler, at an inn along The Broadway in London. They planned to rob the house of Joseph Lawrence, a farmer at Earlsbury Farm in Edgware. Late that afternoon, after stopping twice along the way for food and drink, they captured a shepherd boy and burst into the house, armed with pistols. They bound the two maidservants, and brutally attacked the 70-year-old farmer. They pulled his breeches around his ankles, and dragged him around the house, but Lawrence refused to reveal the whereabouts of his money. Turpin beat Lawrence&#x27;s bare buttocks with his pistols, badly bruising him, and other members of the gang beat him around the head with their pistols. They emptied a kettle of water over his head, forced him to sit bare-buttocked on the fire, and pulled him around the house by his nose, and hair. Gregory took one of the maidservants upstairs and raped her. For their trouble, the gang escaped with a haul of less than .

Three days later Turpin, accompanied by the same men along with William Saunders and Humphrey Walker, brutally raided a farm in Marylebone. The attack netted the gang just under . The next day the Duke of Newcastle offered a reward of in exchange for information leading to the conviction of the &quot;several persons&quot; involved in the two Woodford robberies, and the robberies of the widow Shelley and Reverend Dyde. On 11 February Fielder, Saunders, and Wheeler, were apprehended. Two accounts of their capture exist. One claims that on their way to rob the Lawrence household the gang had stopped at an alehouse in Edgware, and that on 11 February, while out walking, the owner noticed a group of horses outside an alehouse in Bloomsbury. He recognised these horses as those used by the same group of men who had stopped at his alehouse before the Lawrence attack, and called for the parish constable. Another account claims that two of the gang were spotted by a servant of Joseph Lawrence. Regardless, the three, who were drinking with a woman (possibly Mary Brazier) were promptly arrested and committed to prison. Wheeler, who may have been as young as 15, quickly betrayed his colleagues, and descriptions of those yet to be captured were circulated in the press. In &quot;The London Gazette&quot;, Turpin was described as &quot;Richard Turpin, a butcher by trade, is a tall fresh coloured man, very much marked with the small pox, about 26 years of age, about five feet nine inches high, lived some time ago in Whitechapel and did lately lodge somewhere about Millbank, Westminster, wears a blue grey coat and a natural wig&quot;.

== Breakup of the Essex gang ==

Once Wheeler&#x27;s confession became apparent, the other members of the gang fled their usual haunts. Turpin informed Gregory and the others of Wheeler&#x27;s capture, and left Westminster. On 15 February 1735, while Wheeler was busy confessing to the authorities, &quot;three or four men&quot; (most likely Samuel Gregory, Herbert Haines, Turpin, and possibly Thomas Rowden) robbed the house of a Mrs St. John at Chingford. On the following day Turpin (and Rowden, if present) parted company with Gregory and Haines, and headed for Hempstead to see his family. Gregory and Haines may have gone looking for Turpin, because on 17 February they stopped at an alehouse in Debden and ordered a shoulder of mutton, intending to stay for the night. However, a man named Palmer recognised them, and called for the parish constable. A fracas ensued, during which the two thieves escaped. They rejoined Turpin, and along with Jones and Rowden may have travelled to Gravesend before returning to Woodford. Another robbery was reported at Woodford toward the end of February—possibly by Gregory and his cohorts—but with most avenues of escape cut off, and with the authorities hunting them down, the remaining members of the Essex gang kept their heads down and remained under cover, probably in Epping Forest.

Six days after the arrest of Fielder, Saunders, and Wheeler – just as Turpin and his associates were returning from Gravesend – Rose, Brazier, and Walker were captured at a chandler&#x27;s shop in Westminster, while drinking punch. Fielder, Rose, Saunders and Walker were tried at the Middlesex General Session between 26 February and 1 March 1735. Turpin and Gregory were also named on the indictments for burglary. Walker died while still in Newgate Prison, but the remaining three were hanged at Tyburn gallows on 10 March, before their bodies were hung to rot in gibbets on Edgware Road. Walker&#x27;s body was hung in chains. Two days before the hanging, a report of &quot;four suspicious men&quot; being driven away from an alehouse at East Sheen appeared in a newspaper, and was likely describing Gregory and his companions, but the remaining members of the Essex gang were not reported again until 30 March, when three of them (unsuccessfully) tried to steal a horse from a servant of the Earl of Suffolk.

Turpin was present with four of the gang at another robbery, reported on 8 March. Jasper Gregory meanwhile was captured, and then executed late in March. His brothers were arrested on 9 April in Rake, West Sussex, after a struggle during which Samuel lost the tip of his nose to a sword, and Jeremy was shot in the leg. He died in Winchester gaol; Samuel was tried in May, and executed on 4 June. His body was later moved, to hang in chains alongside those of his colleagues at Edgware. Mary Brazier was transported to the Thirteen Colonies. Herbert Haines was captured on 13 April, and executed in August. John Wheeler, who had been instrumental in proving the cases against his former colleagues, and who was freed, died at Hackney in January 1738. The reason for his death is not recorded, but is assumed to be natural causes.

== Highwayman ==
With the Essex gang now smashed by the authorities, Turpin turned instead to the crime he became most noted forhighway robbery. Although he may have been involved in earlier highway robberies on 10 and 12 April, he was first identified as a suspect in one event on 10 July, as &quot;Turpin the butcher&quot;, along with Thomas Rowden, &quot;the pewterer&quot;. Several days later the two struck at Epping Forest, depriving a man from Southwark of his belongings. With a further bounty of £100 on their heads they continued their activities through the latter half of 1735. In August they robbed five people accompanying a coach on Barnes Common, and shortly after that they attacked another coach party, between Putney and Kingston Hill. On 20 August the pair relieved a Mr Godfrey of six guineas and a pocket book, on Hounslow Heath. Fearing capture, they moved on to Blackheath in Hertfordshire, and then back to London. On 5 December the two were seen near Winchester, but in late December, following the capture of John Jones, they separated. Rowden had previously been convicted of counterfeiting, and in July 1736 he was convicted of passing counterfeit coin, under the alias Daniel Crispe. Crispe&#x27;s true name was eventually discovered and he was transported in June 1738. Jones also suffered transportation, to the Thirteen Colonies.

Little is known of Turpin&#x27;s movements during 1736. He may have travelled to Holland, as various sightings were reported there, but he may also have assumed an alias and disappeared from public view. In February 1737 though, he spent the night at Puckeridge, with his wife, her maid and a man called Robert Nott. Turpin arranged the meeting by letter, which was intercepted by the authorities. While Turpin escaped to Cambridge, the others were arrested on charges of &quot;violent suspicion of being dangerous rogues and robbing upon the highway&quot;. They were imprisoned at Hertford gaol, although the women were later acquitted (Nott was released at the next Assize). Although one report late in March suggests, unusually, that Turpin alone robbed a company of higlers, in the same month he was reported to be working alongside two other highwaymen, Matthew King (then, and since, incorrectly identified as Tom King), and Stephen Potter. The trio were responsible for a string of robberies between March and April 1737, which ended suddenly in an incident at Whitechapel, after King (or Turpin, depending upon which report is read) had stolen a horse near Waltham Forest. Its owner, Joseph Major, reported the theft to Richard Bayes, landlord of the Green Man public house at Leytonstone. Bayes (who later wrote a biography of Turpin), tracked the horse to the Red Lion at Whitechapel. Major identified the animal, but as it was late evening and the horses had not yet been collected by their owners, they elected to hold a vigil. John King (Matthew King&#x27;s brother) arrived late that night, and was quickly apprehended by the party, which included the local constable. John King told him the whereabouts of Matthew King, who was waiting nearby. During the resulting mêlée, Matthew King was wounded by gunfire, and died on 19 May. Potter was later caught, but at his trial was released for lack of evidence against him.

== Fatal shooting ==
Bayes&#x27; statement regarding the death of Matthew King may have been heavily embellished. Several reports, including Turpin&#x27;s own account, offer different versions of what actually happened on that night early in May 1737; early reports claimed that Turpin had shot King, however by the following month the same newspapers retracted this claim, and stated that Bayes had fired the fatal shot. The shooting of King, however, preceded an event that changed Turpin&#x27;s life significantly. He escaped to a hideaway in Epping Forest, where he was seen by Thomas Morris, a servant of one of the Forest&#x27;s Keepers. Turpin shot and killed Morris on 4 May with a carbine when, armed with pistols, Morris attempted to capture him. The shooting was reported in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;:


Several newspapers suggested that on 6 and 7 May, he committed two highway robberies near Epping. Turpin may also have lost his mount; on 7 May Elizabeth King, the wife of Turpin&#x27;s accomplice, attempted to secure two horses left by Matthew King, at an inn called the Red Lion. The horses were suspected as belonging to &quot;highwaymen&quot; and Elizabeth King was arrested for questioning, but she was later released without charge. Morris&#x27;s killing unleashed a flood of Turpin reports, and a reward of £200 was offered for his capture.

== As John Palmer ==
Sometime around June 1737 Turpin boarded at the Ferry Inn at Brough, under the alias of John Palmer (or Parmen). Travelling across the River Humber between the historic counties of the East Riding of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, he posed as a horse trader, and often hunted alongside local gentlemen. On 2 October 1738 Turpin shot another man&#x27;s game cock in the street. While being rebuked by John Robinson, he then threatened to shoot him also. Three East Riding justices (JPs), George Crowle (Member of Parliament for Hull), Hugh Bethell, and Marmaduke Constable, travelled to Brough and took written depositions about the incident. They intended to bind him over, but Turpin refused to pay the required surety, and was committed to the House of Correction at Beverley. Turpin was escorted to Beverley by the parish constable, Carey Gill. He made no attempt at escape; It has been suggested that Turpin may have been depressed about failures in his life.

Robert Appleton, Clerk of the Peace for the East Riding, and the man whose account details the above incident, later reported that the three JPs made enquiries as to how &quot;Palmer&quot; had made his money, suspecting that his lifestyle was funded by criminal activities. Turpin claimed that he was a butcher who had fallen into debt, and that he had from his home in Long Sutton, Lincolnshire. When contacted, the JP at Long Sutton (a Mr Delamere) confirmed that John Palmer had lived there for about nine months, but that he was suspected of stealing sheep, and had escaped the custody of the local constable. Delamere also suspected that Palmer was a horse-thief and had taken several depositions supporting his view, and told the three JPs that he would prefer him to be detained. The three JPs now presumed that the case was too serious for Palmer to remain at Beverley House of Correction, and demanded sureties for his appearance at York Assizes. Turpin refused, and so on 16 October he was transferred to York Castle in handcuffs.

Horse theft became a capital offence in 1545, punishable by death. During the 17th and 18th centuries, crimes in violation of property rights were some of the most severely punished; most of the 200 capital statutes were property offences. Robbery combined with violence was &quot;the sort of offence, second only to premeditated murder (a relatively uncommon crime), most likely to be prosecuted and punished to [the law&#x27;s] utmost rigour&quot;. Turpin had stolen several horses while operating under the pseudonym of Palmer. In July 1737 he stole a horse from Pinchbeck in Lincolnshire, and took it to visit his father at Hempstead. When Turpin returned to Brough (stealing three horses along the way) he left the gelding with his father. The identity of John Turpin&#x27;s son was well known, and the horse&#x27;s identity was soon discovered. On 12 September 1738 therefore, John Turpin was committed to gaol in Essex on charges of horse theft, but following his help in preventing a gaolbreak, the charges were dropped on 5 March 1739. About a month after &quot;Palmer&quot; had been moved to York Castle, Thomas Creasy, the owner of the three horses stolen by Turpin, managed to track them down and recover them, and it was for these thefts that he was eventually tried.
From his cell, Turpin wrote to his brother-in-law, Pompr Rivernall, who also lived at Hempstead. Rivernall was married to Turpin&#x27;s sister, Dorothy. The letter was kept at the local post office, but seeing the York post stamp Rivernall refused to pay the delivery charge, claiming that he &quot;had no correspondent at York&quot;. Rivernall may not have wanted to pay the charge for the letter, or he may have wished to distance himself from Turpin&#x27;s affairs. The letter was then moved to the post office at Saffron Walden where James Smith, who had taught his younger schoolmate Turpin how to write while they were at school, recognised the handwriting. He alerted JP Thomas Stubbing, who paid the postage and opened the letter. Smith travelled to York Castle and on 23 February identified Palmer as Turpin. He received the £200 (about £ as of ) reward originally offered by the Duke of Newcastle following Turpin&#x27;s murder of Thomas Morris.

== Trial ==

Although there was some question as to where the trial should be held—the Duke of Newcastle wanted him tried in London—Turpin was tried at York Assizes. Proceedings began three days after the winter Assizes opened, on 22 March. Turpin was charged with the theft of Creasy&#x27;s horses: a mare worth three pounds, a foal worth 20 shillings, and a gelding worth three pounds. The indictments stated that the alleged offences had occurred at Welton on 1 March 1739, and described Turpin as &quot;John Palmer alias Pawmer alias Richard Turpin ... late of the castle of York in the County of York labourer&quot;. Technically the charges were invalid—the offences had occurred at Heckington, not Welton, and the date was also incorrect; the offences were in August 1738.

Presiding over the trial was Sir William Chapple, a senior and respected judge in his early sixties. The prosecution was directed by King&#x27;s Counsel Thomas Place and Richard Crowle (brother of George), and proceedings were recorded by a York resident, Thomas Kyll. Turpin had no defence barrister; during this period of English history, for those accused of felonies it was costly to find legal representation, their interests were cared for by the presiding judge. Among the seven witnesses called to testify were Thomas Creasy, and James Smith, the man who had recognised Turpin&#x27;s handwriting. Turpin offered little in the way of questioning his accusers; when asked if he had anything to ask of Creasy, he replied &quot;I cannot say anything, for I have not any witnesses come this day, as I have expected, and therefore beg of your Lordship to put off my trial &#x27;till another day&quot;, and when asked about Smith, he claimed not to know him. When questioned himself, Turpin told the court that he had bought the mare and foal from an inn-keeper near Heckington. He repeated his original story of how he had come to use the pseudonym Palmer, claiming that it was his mother&#x27;s maiden name. When asked by the judge for his name before he came to Lincolnshire, he said &quot;Turpin&quot;. Without leaving the courtroom the jury found Turpin guilty of the first charge of stealing the mare and foal, and following further proceedings, guilty of stealing the gelding. Throughout the trial Turpin had repeatedly claimed that he had not been allowed enough time to form his defence, that proceedings should be delayed until he could call his witnesses, and that the trial should be held at Essex. Before sentencing him, the judge asked Turpin if he could offer any reason why he should not be sentenced to death; Turpin said: &quot;It is very hard upon me, my Lord, because I was not prepar&#x27;d for my Defence.&quot; The judge replied: &quot;Why was you not? You knew the Time of the Assizes as well as any Person here.&quot; Despite Turpin&#x27;s pleas that he had been told the trial would be held in Essex, the judge replied: &quot;Whoever told you so were highly to blame; and as your country have found you guilty of a crime worthy of death, it is my office to pronounce sentence against you&quot;, sentencing him to death.

== Execution ==

Before his execution, Turpin frequently received visitors (the gaoler was reputed to have earned £100 from selling drinks to Turpin and his guests), although he refused the efforts of a local clergyman who offered him &quot;serious remonstrances and admonitions&quot;. Turpin&#x27;s father may have sent him a letter, dated 29 March, urging him to &quot;beg of God to pardon your many transgressions, which the thief upon the cross received pardon for at the last hour&quot;. Turpin bought a new frock coat and shoes, and on the day before his execution hired five mourners for three pounds and ten shillings to be shared between them.

On 7 April 1739, followed by his mourners, Turpin and John Stead (a horse thief) were taken through York by open cart to Knavesmire, which was then the city&#x27;s equivalent of London&#x27;s Tyburn gallows. Turpin &quot;behav&#x27;d himself with amazing assurance&quot;, and &quot;bow&#x27;d to the spectators as he passed&quot;. He climbed a ladder to the gallows and spoke to his executioner. York had no permanent hangman, and it was the custom to pardon a prisoner on condition that he acted as executioner. On this occasion, the pardoned man was a fellow highwayman, Thomas Hadfield. An account in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; for 7 April 1739 notes Turpin&#x27;s brashness: &quot;Turpin behaved in an undaunted manner; as he mounted the ladder, feeling his right leg tremble, he spoke a few words to the topsman, then threw himself off, and expir&#x27;d in five minutes.&quot;

The short drop method of hanging meant that those executed were killed by slow strangulation, and so Turpin was left hanging until late afternoon, before being cut down and taken to a tavern in Castlegate. The next morning, Turpin&#x27;s body was buried in the graveyard of St George&#x27;s Church, Fishergate, opposite what is now the Roman Catholic St George&#x27;s Church. On the Tuesday following the burial, the corpse was reportedly stolen by body-snatchers. The theft of cadavers for medical research was a common enough occurrence, and was possibly tolerated by the authorities in York. The practice was however unpopular with the general public, and the body-snatchers, together with Turpin&#x27;s corpse, were soon apprehended by a mob. The body was recovered and reburied, supposedly this time with quicklime. Turpin&#x27;s body is purported to lie in St George&#x27;s graveyard, although some doubt persists as to the grave&#x27;s authenticity.

== Later views ==

Some of the Turpin legend can be sourced directly to Richard Bayes&#x27; &quot;The Genuine History of the Life of Richard Turpin&quot; (1739), a mixture of fact and fiction hurriedly put together in the wake of the trial, to satisfy a gullible public. The speeches of the condemned, biographies of criminals, and trial literature, were popular genres during the late 17th and early 18th centuries; written for a mass audience and a precursor to the modern novel, they were &quot;produced on a scale which beggars comparison with any period before or since&quot;. Such literature functioned as news and a &quot;forum in which anxieties about crime, punishment, sin, salvation, the workings of providence and social and moral transgression generally could be expressed and negotiated.&quot;

Bayes&#x27; document contains elements of conjecture; for instance, his claim that Turpin was married to a Miss Palmer (and not Elizabeth Millington) is almost certainly incorrect, and the date of Turpin&#x27;s marriage, for which no documentary evidence has been found, appears to be based solely on Bayes&#x27; claim that in 1739 Turpin had married 11 or 12 years earlier. His account of those present during the robberies committed by the Essex Gang often contains names that never appeared in contemporary newspaper reports, suggesting, according to author Derek Barlow, that Bayes embellished his story. Bayes&#x27; description of Turpin&#x27;s relationship with &quot;King the Highwayman&quot; is almost certainly fictional. Turpin may have known Matthew King as early as 1734, and had an active association with him from February 1737, but the story of the &quot;Gentleman Highwayman&quot; may have been created only to link the end of the Essex gang with the author&#x27;s own recollection of events. Barlow also views the account of the theft of Turpin&#x27;s corpse, appended to Thomas Kyll&#x27;s publication of 1739, as &quot;handled with such delicacy as to amount almost to reverence&quot;, and therefore of suspect provenance.

No contemporary portrait exists of Turpin, who as a notorious but unremarkable figure was not considered sufficiently important to be immortalised. An engraving in one edition of Bayes&#x27; 1739 publication, of a man hiding in a cave, is sometimes supposed to be him, but the closest description that exists is that given by John Wheeler, of &quot;a fresh coloured man, very much marked with the small pox, about five feet nine inches high ... wears a blue grey coat and a light coloured wig&quot;. An E-FIT of Turpin, created from such reports, was published by the Castle Museum in York in 2009.

Turpin is best known for his exploits as a highwayman, but before his execution the only contemporary report of him as such was in June 1737, when a broadsheet entitled &quot;News news: great and wonderful news from London in an uproar or a hue and cry after the Great Turpin, with his escape into Ireland&quot; was published. Although some highwaymen of the seventeenth century had become the subject of chapbooks, names such as James Hind, Claude Duval and William Nevison, are not nearly as well-known today as the legend of Dick Turpin, whose fictionalised exploits first began to appear around the turn of the 19th century. It was, however, the story of a fabled ride from London to York that provided the impetus for 19th-century author William Harrison Ainsworth to include and embellish the exploit in his 1834 novel &quot;Rookwood&quot;. Ainsworth used Turpin as a plot device, describing him in a manner that makes him more lively than the book&#x27;s other characters. Turpin is introduced with the pseudonym Palmer, and is later forced to escape on his horse, Black Bess. Although fast enough to keep ahead of those in pursuit, Black Bess eventually dies under the stress of the journey. This scene appealed more to readers than the rest of the work, and as Turpin was depicted as a likeable character who made the life of a criminal seem appealing, the story came to form part of the modern legend surrounding Turpin. The artist Edward Hull capitalised on Ainsworth&#x27;s story, publishing six prints of notable events in Turpin&#x27;s career.

Ainsworth&#x27;s tale of Turpin&#x27;s overnight journey from London to York on his mare Black Bess has its origins in an episode recorded by Daniel Defoe, in his 1727 work &quot;A tour thro&#x27; the whole island of Great Britain&quot;. After committing a robbery in Kent in 1676, William Nevison apparently rode to York to establish an alibi, and Defoe&#x27;s account of that journey became part of folk legend. A similar ride was attributed to Turpin as early as 1808, and was being performed on stage by 1819, but the feat as imagined by Ainsworth (about 200 miles in less than a day) is impossible. Nevertheless, Ainsworth&#x27;s legend of Black Bess was repeated in works such as &quot;Black Bess or the Knight of the Road&quot;, a 254-part penny dreadful published in 1867–68. In these tales, Turpin was the hero, accompanied by his trusty colleagues Claude Duval, Tom King, and Jack Rann. These narratives, which transformed Turpin from a pockmarked thug and murderer into &quot;a gentleman of the road [and] a protector of the weak&quot;, followed a popular cultural tradition of romanticising English criminals. This practice is reflected in the ballads written about Turpin, the earliest of which, &quot;Dick Turpin&quot;, would appear to have been published in 1737. Later ballads presented Turpin as an 18th-century Robin Hood figure: &quot;Turpin was caught and his trial was passed, and for a game cock he died at last. Five hundred pounds he gave so free, all to Jack Ketch as a small legacy.&quot;

===Legacy===
Stories about Turpin continued to be published well into the 20th century, and the legend was also transferred to the stage and film.

In 1845 the playwright George Dibdin Pitt recreated the most notable &quot;facts&quot; of Turpin&#x27;s life, and in 1846 Marie Tussaud added a wax sculpture of Turpin to her collection at Madame Tussauds. Astley&#x27;s Amphitheatre put on a hippodrama of &quot;Dick Turpin&#x27;s Ride to York.&quot;

In 1906 actor Fred Ginnett wrote and starred in the film &quot;Dick Turpin&#x27;s Last Ride to York&quot;. &quot;Dick Turpin&#x27;s Ride to York&quot; is a 1922 British historical silent film drama directed by Maurice Elvey, the first feature-length film of the story. It was for many years assumed by film historians to be completely lost, but two reels were rediscovered in 2003. Other silent versions appeared for the silver screen, and some adaptations even moulded Turpin into a figure styled on Robin Hood. Sid James appeared as Turpin in the 1974 Carry On film &quot;Carry On Dick,&quot; and LWT cast Richard O&#x27;Sullivan as Turpin in their eponymous series &quot;Dick Turpin&quot; (1979–1982). Noel Fielding starred as Turpin in &quot;The Completely Made-Up Adventures of Dick Turpin&quot; for Apple TV+.

There is a street in Feltham, near Hatton Cross tube station on the edge of London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport, named Dick Turpin Way, owing to the belief that Turpin lurked in nearby Hounslow Heath.

<doc id="207945" wikidata="Q957666" url="?curid=207945" title="Critique of Dialectical Reason">
<text>Critique of Dialectical Reason () is a 1960 book by the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, in which the author further develops the existentialist Marxism he first expounded in his essay &quot;Search for a Method&quot; (1957). &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; and &quot;Search for a Method&quot; were written as a common manuscript, with Sartre intending the former to logically precede the latter. &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; was Sartre&#x27;s second large-scale philosophical treatise, &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; (1943) having been the first. The book has been seen by some as an abandonment of Sartre&#x27;s original existentialism, while others have seen it as a continuation and elaboration of his earlier work. It was translated into English by Alan Sheridan-Smith.

The first volume, &quot;Theory of Practical Ensembles&quot;, was first published in English in 1976; a corrected English translation was published in 1991, based on the revised French edition of 1985. The second volume, &quot;The Intelligibility of History&quot;, was published posthumously in French in 1985 with an English translation by Quintin Hoare appearing in 1991.

Sartre is quoted as having said this was the principal of his two philosophical works for which he wished to be remembered.

==Background==
In the wake of &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;, Sartre became concerned with reconciling his concept of freedom with concrete social subjects and was strongly influenced in this regard by his friend and associate Maurice Merleau-Ponty, whose writings in the late 1940s and early 1950s, including &quot;Sense and Non-Sense&quot;, were pioneering a path towards a synthesis of existentialism and Marxism. Merleau-Ponty, however, then became increasingly skeptical of Marxism, culminating in his &quot;Adventures of the Dialectic&quot; (1955), while Sartre continued to grow more engaged with Marxist thought. Though Sartre had, by 1957, decisively broken with the Soviet Union and &quot;official&quot; Marxism in the wake of the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian uprising, he nonetheless declared Marxism &quot;the philosophy of our time&quot; and stated the need to resuscitate it from the moribund state that Soviet dogma had left it in, a need he attempted to answer by writing &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot;. The conflict between Sartre and Merleau-Ponty on this issue ended their long-standing friendship, though Ronald Aronson states that, in part, &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; was Sartre&#x27;s answer to his former friend and political mentor&#x27;s attack on Marxism.

More generally, &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; was written following the rejection of Communism by leftist French intellectuals sympathetic to Marxism, a process that not only ended Sartre&#x27;s friendship with Merleau-Ponty but with Albert Camus as well. The work was part of Sartre&#x27;s attempt to learn &quot;the lessons of history&quot; from these events, and to try to create an adequate Marxist history and sociology.

==Summary==
&quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; is the product of a later stage in Sartre&#x27;s thinking, during which he no longer identified Marxism with the Soviet Union or French Communism but came closer to identifying as a Marxist. In it, Sartre puts forward a revision of existentialism, and an interpretation of Marxism as a contemporary philosophy &quot;par excellence&quot;, one that can be criticized only from a reactionary pre-Marxist standpoint.

Sartre argues that while the free fusion of many human projects may possibly constitute a Communist society, there is no guarantee of this. Conscious human acts are not projections of freedom that produce human &#x27;temporality&#x27;, but movements toward &#x27;totalization&#x27;, their sense being co-determined by existing social conditions. People are thus neither absolutely free to determine the meaning of their acts nor slaves to the circumstances in which they find themselves. Social life does not consist only of individual acts rooted in freedom since it is also a sedimentation of history by which we are limited and a fight with nature, which imposes further obstacles and causes social relationships to be dominated by scarcity. Every satisfaction of a need can cause antagonism and make it more difficult for people to accept each other as human beings. Scarcity deprives people of the ability to make particular choices and diminishes their humanity. Communism will restore the freedom of the individual and his/her ability to recognize the freedom of others.

==Reception==
From the time the &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; was published in 1960, there has been much discussion about where it stands in relation to Sartre&#x27;s earlier, seminal work, &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;. Some Sartre scholars and critics, like George Kline, see the work as essentially a repudiation of Sartre&#x27;s existentialist stance. Marjorie Grene thinks that the &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; can be readily translated into the categories of &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;. Hazel Barnes and Peter Caws see a shift in emphasis between the two works but not a difference of kind. Barnes observes that the title &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; &quot;suggests both Kant and Hegel.&quot; According to Barnes, the &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; resembles Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; in that it is concerned &quot;with the nature, possibilities, and limitations of human reason.&quot; She sees this as the only similarity, however, since Sartre&#x27;s interests are not primarily epistemological or metaphysical and he is more indebted to Hegel than to Kant. Josef Catalano argues that the &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; gives a historical and social dimension to the being-for-itself described in &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;. Finally, Fredric Jameson believes that a reading of the Critique forever alters our view of what Sartre meant in &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;, that the label &quot;existentialist&quot; as applied to Sartre can no longer have its previous meaning.

Sartre&#x27;s analysis of &quot;groups-in-fusion&quot; (people brought together by a common cause) resonated with the events of the May–June 1968 uprising in France and allowed him to sideline for a while the competing influence of Louis Althusser&#x27;s structuralist interpretation of Marxism. Situating the &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; in the context of May–June 1968, the psychoanalyst Didier Anzieu stated that &quot;Sartre first described in his book the passive and anonymous forms of individual alienation--this is what he calls the &#x27;practico-inert&#x27;--and then he showed how a group introduces negation into history and shapes itself (instead of being shaped), invents itself by breaking with this passive and anonymous society that an American sociologist called &#x27;the lonely crowd.&#x27; The students who sparked the outbreak of the revolution of the spring of 1968 were shaped by, if not this second Sartrean philosophy, at least a dialectical philosophy of history. May of 1968 is the historical upsurge of a &#x27;wild-flowering&#x27; force of negation. It is the inroad of &#x27;Sartrean&#x27; freedom, not that of the isolated individual but the creative freedom of groups.&quot;

The philosopher Sidney Hook described the work as a philosophical justification for widespread human rights abuses by the Communist leadership of the Soviet Union. The psychiatrists R. D. Laing and David Cooper consider the &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; an attempt to provide a dialectical basis for structural anthropology, and to establish through a dialectical approach the limits of dialectical reason. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari endorsed Sartre&#x27;s view that there is no &quot;class spontaneity&quot; but only &quot;group spontaneity&quot;.

Leszek Kołakowski argues that the &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; represents an abandonment of Sartre&#x27;s original existentialism and that it absurdly depicts Marxism as &quot;invincible&quot;. Kołakowski nevertheless considers the book an interesting attempt to find room for creativity and spontaneity within Marxism, noting that Sartre rejects the dialectic of nature and historical determinism while preserving the social significance of human behavior. Kołakowski criticizes Sartre for failing to explain how Communism could restore freedom. In his view, Sartre gives such a generalized account of revolutionary organization that he ignores the real difficulties of groups engaging in common action without infringing the freedom of their individual members. Kołakowski criticizes Sartre for introducing many superfluous neologisms, writing that aside from these he does not provide a genuinely new interpretation of Marxism; he sees Sartre&#x27;s view of the historical character of perception and knowledge and its rejection of the dialectic of nature as stemming from the work of György Lukács. In his view, neither Sartre&#x27;s view that freedom must be safeguarded in revolutionary organization nor his view that there will be perfect freedom when Communism has abolished shortages is new in a Marxist context, and Sartre fails to explain how either could have been brought about.

The conservative philosopher Roger Scruton writes that the &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; &quot;shows a total rejection of the rules of intellectual enquiry - a determined flight from the rule of truth. To suppose that the book might actually fulfill the promise offered by its title is in fact a gross impertinence.&quot;

<text>Isobel Gowdie was a Scottish woman who confessed to witchcraft at Auldearn near Nairn during 1662. Scant information is available about her age or life and, although she was probably executed in line with the usual practice, it is uncertain whether this was the case or if she was allowed to return to the obscurity of her former life as a cottar’s wife. Her detailed testimony, apparently achieved without the use of violent torture, provides one of the most comprehensive insights into European witchcraft folklore at the end of the era of witch-hunts.

The four confessions she made over a period of six weeks include details of charms and rhymes, claims she was a member of a coven in the service of the Devil and that she met with the fairy queen and king. Lurid information concerning carnal dealings with the Devil were also provided. A combination of demonic and fairy beliefs, the narratives were used by Margaret Murray as the basis for her now mostly discredited theories about cults and witchcraft.

Modern day academics characterise Gowdie, who was illiterate and of a low social status, as a talented narrator with a creative imagination. It is unclear why she came forward or was initially arrested but she may have suffered from ergotism. Since the confessions were transcribed by Robert Pitcairn and first published in 1833, historians have described the material as remarkable or extraordinary and scholars continue to debate the topic in the 21st century.

Gowdie is commemorated outside academia by songs, books, plays and radio broadcasts. &quot;The Confession of Isobel Gowdie&quot;, a 1990 work for symphony orchestra, was composed by James MacMillan as a requiem for her.

==Background==
The early modern period saw the Scottish courts trying many cases of witchcraft and witch hunts began in about 1550. The parliament of Mary, Queen of Scots, passed the Scottish Witchcraft Act in 1563, making convictions for witchcraft subject to capital punishment. Mary&#x27;s son, James, wrote &quot;Daemonologie&quot; in 1597 after his involvement with the North Berwick witch trials in 1590 and the Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597, a nationwide hunt that started in Aberdeen. In common with other European witch trials, major Scottish witch hunts occurred in batches; historians offer differing opinions as to why this would happen but generally agree that military hostilities and political or economic uncertainty played a part coupled with local ministers and landowners determined to seek convictions. Scotland had been subjected to nearly a century of vigorous oppression although areas in the north of the country had not felt the full brunt of Presbyterianism so a strong belief in fairy traditions and folklore persisted. The Laird of Castle of Park (Aberdeenshire), who owned the land where Gowdie lived, was a fervent Covenanter and rejected all traditional superstitions. He had been involved in commissions for witchcraft trials and the deaths of his father, uncle and grandfather were publicly credited as being caused by witchcraft.

Adverse weather conditions caused a sustained period of poor harvests from 1649 until 1653. The execution of King Charles I took place in 1649 and an extensive witch hunt started that year. Charles II was declared the monarch of Scotland in 1660; most historians connect the Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1661–62, the last but most severe wave of prosecutions, with the Restoration. Writing in 1884, Scottish antiquary Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe opined &quot;Whatever satisfaction the return of King Charles the Second might afford to the younger females in his dominions, it certainly brought nothing, save torture and destruction, to the unfortunate old women, or witches of Scotland.&quot; According to Emma Wilby, a British historian who has undertaken a comprehensive study of Gowdie and her confessions, she was one of probably seven witches tried in Auldearn during this witch hunt.

==Personal life==
Records provide no information on Gowdie before her marriage to John Gilbert, who had no involvement in the witchcraft case. Wilby speculates that she would have been brought up in the Auldearn region as she alluded to locations in the area. Likewise no detail is available concerning her age; at the time of her trial in 1662 she may have been aged anywhere from fifteen – although this is unlikely as she claimed to have participated in sexual activities fifteen years before her confession – to well into her thirties or fifties but she was certainly of child-bearing age despite there being no records of her having any children.

Gowdie and her husband lived in the area around Loch Loy, about two miles north of Auldearn. In the 17th century, the sea loch was larger than it is now and was surrounded by woodland, hills and sand dunes. Gowdie&#x27;s husband was a farm labourer, possibly a cottar, hired by one of the tenants of the Laird of Park; in return for his labour he would have been provided with a cottage and the use of a small parcel of land. According to Wilby, their lifestyle and social status could be compared with present-day developing countries. Unable to read or write, Gowdie possessed a good imagination and the ability to express herself eloquently. Her daily life was spent in basic household chores and tasks such as milking, making bread, weaving yarn or weeding.

==Confessions==
Gowdie made four confessions over a period of six weeks; the first is dated 13 April 1662 at Auldearn. It is uncertain why she came forward; the historian John Callow, who authored her Oxford Dictionary of National Biography article, suggests it was because of her involvement in a conspiracy to torment the local minister, Harry Forbes, a zealous extremist who had a fear of witchcraft. Forbes was a witness at each of Gowdie&#x27;s four interrogations. Accusations against Gowdie would have circulated for a lengthy period before she confessed. She would have been detained in solitary confinement, most probably in the tolbooth in Auldearn, throughout the six-week time span of her confessions.

Her first confession described an encounter with the Devil after she arranged to meet him in the kirk at Auldearn at night. Naming several others who attended including Janet Breadhead and Margret Brodie, she said she renounced her baptism and the Devil put his mark on her shoulder then sucked blood from it. Other meetings took place at several locations, for instance Nairn and Inshoch. She touched on having sexual intercourse with the Devil who she described as a very cold &quot;meikle, blak, roch man&quot;. He had forked and cloven feet that were sometimes covered with shoes or boots. Details were given of taking a child&#x27;s body from a grave and spoiling crops together with information about covens and where they danced. She explained that brooms were laid beside her husband in his bed so he would not notice she was absent. The coven ate and drank the best of food at houses they reached by flying through the air on magical horses and entered via the windows. They were entertained by the Queen of the Fairies, also known as the Queen of Elphame, in her home at Downie Hill which was filled with water bulls that frightened her. Gowdie claimed to have made clay effigies of the Laird of Park&#x27;s male children to cause them suffering or death and that she had assumed the form of a jackdaw and, with other members of the coven who had transformed into animals like cats and hares, visited the house of Alexander Cumings. Some parts of her testimony, like her description of the king and queen of fairies, has been cut short when the notaries have just noted &quot;et cetera&quot;, a frequent occurrence when the material was deemed irrelevant or, if it did not comply with the inference the interrogators intended, it was abruptly ended. Alternatively it may have happened when the scribes were unable to keep pace with the volume of information being narrated by Gowdie.
A little over two weeks later, on 3 May 1662, Gowdie&#x27;s second confession was transcribed. She expanded on details about the coven by providing the nicknames of its members and as many of the spirits that waited on them as she could remember; her own servant spirit, dressed in black, was called the Read Reiver. Claims included having the ability to transform into animals with the individual chants used to turn into a cat, horse or various other animals supplied. Over the duration of all her confessions a total of twenty-seven benevolent or malevolent chants were given, more than in any other British witchcraft case; three were transcribed twice but with significant differences.

Gowdie testified the Devil handmade elf arrows that were then enhanced by small roughly-spoken &quot;elf-boys&quot;. The Devil allocated a number of arrows to each coven member with instructions they were to be fired in his name; no bows were supplied so the arrows were flicked by thumb. The witches were not always accurate when they fired the arrows but if the intended target, whether it was a woman, a man or an animal, was touched by the implement, she claimed they would die even if wearing a protective armour. Spells used to inflict illness and torment on Harry Forbes, the minister, were also described.

On 15 May 1662 Gowdie was brought before her interrogators for a third time. Like her first and second confessions, and in common with many other Scottish witchcraft testimonies, the transcript begins by detailing her pact with the Devil after she encountered him and agreed to meet him at Auldearn kirk. Taking the information she provided previously about the elf arrows a step further, she revealed the names of those killed, expressing regret for the deaths she caused and supplied names of other coven members with details of who they had murdered too. She gave an account of the Devil sending her on an errand to Auldearn disguised as a hare. Her narrative went on to describe how while in that form she was chased by a pack of dogs; she escaped from them by running from house to house until eventually she had the opportunity to utter the chant to transform herself back into a human. She added that sometimes the dogs would be able to bite a witch when she took the form of a hare; although the dogs could not kill the shapeshifter, the bite marks and scars would still be evident once the human form was reinstated.

Descriptions of dining with the Devil and his beating of coven members and their responses to it are recounted. Salacious details concerning sexual relations with the Devil together with broad characteristics of his genitalia are chronicled. Continuing on from the tale in her first testimony about the methods undertaken to kill any male children of the Laird of Park, the verse the Devil had taught them to chant while burning the effigies was relayed.

The fourth and final confession, dated 27 May 1662, is, according to the historian Robert Pitcairn who first reproduced Gowdie&#x27;s testimonies in 1833, basically to confirm the three previous testimonies coupled with an attempt to elicit more information about the members of the coven to enable charges to be brought against them. Forty-one people were arrested as the result of Breadhead and Gowdie&#x27;s statements.

==Aftermath==
The panel of interrogators felt there was ample evidence to secure a conviction against Gowdie so they applied to the Privy Council in Edinburgh seeking a Commission of Justiciary for a local trial to be held. Together with the confession of her accomplice, Janet Breadhead, some or all of Gowdie&#x27;s confessions were sent with the request. According to Wilby, it is likely the confessions were received in Edinburgh around the middle of June 1662; the Register of the Privy Council for July contains an entry instructing the Sheriff principal of Nairn, Sir Hew Campbell of Calder [Cawdor], and others to arrange local trials for both women.

Gowdie&#x27;s second testimony has a note on the back dated 10 July 1662 indicating the document had been appraised and the justice department found it germane; a further instruction was added to &quot;Tak ceare of this peaper&quot;. On the same document the justice depute, Alexander Colville, added a signed statement beside the witness signatures endorsing the commission. Lord Brodie was likely to have been involved in approving the commission; he was in Edinburgh at the time and he noted in his diary that he had been &quot;excisd in ordouring the depositions of witches&quot;. The entry in his diary the following day describes a meeting with Colville when they discussed witches and he mentions &quot;Park&#x27;s witches&quot;. Brodie was highly thought of by the minister and the lairds from the Auldearn area who had asked for his intervention on prior occasions. His relative, the Laird of Lethen, was a witness at Gowdie&#x27;s interrogations and visited Brodie at the time; he was probably the person who took the trial application to Edinburgh. The pair prayed together petitioning against the Devil and witchcraft.

On 10 April 1662 the Privy Council had issued a proclamation prohibiting torture being used as a means of securing confessions from witches unless it was specifically authorised by the council. This led to a caution frequently being appended to commissions. In Gowdie and Breadhead&#x27;s case, the Council advised they should be found guilty only if the confessions had been volunteered without torture, that they were sane and without a wish to die.

There is no record of Gowdie being executed although this is not unusual as in 90 per cent of Scottish cases the outcome is unknown due to the local records no longer existing. Wilby hypothesises that once the commission was returned to Auldearn, Gowdie and Breadhead would have been found guilty at a local trial in mid-July, transported by cart to Gallowhill on the outskirts of Nairn where they would have been strangled and burned. Prior to 1678 most Scottish witches tried under a Privy Council commission were convicted and executed; Pitcairn shared the opinion that Gowdie and Breadhead were executed and most modern day academics, like historian Brian P. Levack, agree it would be the likely outcome. The possibility the pair may have been acquitted on the basis of mental impairment has been put forward by some historians; Callow suggests they may have been freed under the clauses attached to the commission and then been permitted to return to &quot;quiet obscurity&quot;.

==Modern interpretations==
The confessions are a blend of fairy and demonic beliefs without parallel in any other witchcraft case. They are more detailed than most and are inconsistent with much of the folklore and records from the witchtrials. It is unclear whether Gowdie&#x27;s confessions are the result of psychosis, whether she had fallen under suspicion of witchcraft or sought leniency by confessing. Locally it has been suggested she may have suffered ergotism, which can produce hallucinations and other mental instability. At least two other confessions from the 16th century, those of Andro Mann and Allison Peirson, reported encounters with the Queen of Elphame; later, in 1670, Jean Weir from Edinburgh, also claimed she met the fairy queen.

Gowdie&#x27;s confessions formed the crux of historian Margaret Murray&#x27;s thesis about covens consisting of thirteen members; Murray also asserted cults were structured this way throughout Europe although her work was later discredited. Wilby opines there may have been dark shamanic aspects contained in the fairy elements. Despite the Privy Council&#x27;s April 1662 proclamation, torture was often still employed and Levack speculates some form of it may have been applied to Gowdie; she may have become unbalanced by the imprisonment and lengthy inquisitions. While kept in solitary confinement, she was probably prevented from sleeping and mistreated. Scholars, such as Callow and Diane Purkiss, suggest Gowdie&#x27;s narratives about sumptuous meals are indicative of a woman who was continually hungry; other details may be evidence of a powerless woman, angry and sexually frustrated by the austerity imposed by the ministers. Church and court records show rape as a recurrent crime during civil unrest and in the mid-16th century; Gowdie described her first carnal experience with the Devil as being in 1647 when soldiers may still have been in the area and Wilby postulates the lurid sexual details may be Gowdie&#x27;s &quot;fantasy-response to the trauma of rape.&quot;

Wilby characterises Gowdie as a survivor of conflicts like the Battle of Auldearn, who experienced the wrath of zealous, bigoted, ministers and local elite that were frightened of witches; she was a skilled story-teller who entertained relatives and friends with narratives of the supernatural. She suggests the tales recorded may have been the result of a talented orator responding to a &quot;rapt audience&quot;.

Levack describes Gowdie&#x27;s initial statement as &quot;one of the most remarkable documents in the history of witchcraft&quot; with academic Julian Goodare referring to her as &quot;one of the most famous of all Scottish witches&quot; whose &quot;extraordinary confessions&quot; include &quot;some of the most remarkable [visionary activities] on record&quot;. These modern day descriptions mirror those of Pitcairn in 1833 and George F. Black in 1937 who wrote in the &quot;Calendar of Witchcraft in Scotland&quot; that &quot;This is the most remarkable witchcraft case on record ... referred to, in more or less detail, in every work relating to witchcraft in Scotland.&quot; According to Wilby, the confessions still remain at the forefront of academics debating witchcraft.

==In literature, art and music==
Gowdie and her magic have been remembered in a number of later works of culture.
She appears as a character in the biographical novels &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Mistress&quot; by novelist and occultist J. W. Brodie-Innes, &quot;Isobel&quot; by Jane Parkhurst, &quot;Bitter Magic&quot;, by Nancy Kilgore, &quot;Isobel Gowdie&quot;, by Martin Dey, and the fantasy novel &quot;Night Plague&quot; by Graham Masterton. In the 21st century her story has been the inspiration for plays, radio broadcasts and lectures.

&quot;The Confession of Isobel Gowdie&quot; is a work for symphony orchestra by the Scottish composer James MacMillan; he believed Gowdie&#x27;s confession was obtained by torture, and that she was burned at the stake for witchcraft. In a broadcast by BBC Radio 3 in 2010 he styled the composition as his requiem for her. The Sensational Alex Harvey Band song titled &#x27;Isobel Goudie&#x27; was one of many songs commemorating her.

The traditional English folk singer Fay Hield has set a selection of Gowdie&#x27;s transformation chants to music in the song &#x27;Hare Spell&#x27; from her 2020 album &quot;Wrackline&quot;.

The American heavy metal band King 810 features Gowdie&#x27;s alleged chant in their song Isobel.

In 2023 there was an exhibition of thirteen figures, &quot;Witches in Words, not Deeds&quot;, created by Carolyn Sutton. Gowdie was one of the figures exhibited at Edinburgh&#x27;s Central Library.

<text>Michael Schenker (born 10 January 1955) is a German guitarist. He played in the rock band UFO and leads the Michael Schenker Group (MSG). He was an early member of the hard rock band Scorpions, a band co-founded by his elder brother Rudolf Schenker. In the mid-1970s, Schenker joined UFO, playing lead and rhythm guitar. He left the band in 1978 to briefly rejoin Scorpions for the recording of &quot;Lovedrive&quot;, and then to form MSG. He has rejoined UFO three times, producing an album each time. Schenker continues to perform and record. He has been called &quot;a legendary figure in the history of metal guitar.&quot;

== Career ==

=== Early career and rise to fame: Scorpions and UFO ===
Schenker started playing guitar at an early age, after his brother Rudolf got a Gibson Flying V guitar for his birthday, which captured his imagination. His main influences were Jimmy Page, George Harrison, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Leslie West, Johnny Winter, Steve Marriott and Rory Gallagher. He played his first gig when he was 11, with Rudolf and the Scorpions in a nightclub. Schenker played with the Scorpions on their debut &quot;Lonesome Crow&quot; at the age of 16.

After recording their first album, the Scorpions opened for then-up-and-coming UK band UFO in Germany. Schenker was invited to be lead guitarist for UFO (taking over from Bernie Marsden, himself a temporary replacement for Larry Wallis who had in turn taken over for the departed Mick Bolton). With Rudolf&#x27;s blessing, Schenker accepted.

Schenker cowrote most of the songs on UFO&#x27;s major label (Chrysalis Records) debut &quot;Phenomenon&quot;. His career with UFO was turbulent, sometimes walking off mid-song and causing shows to be cancelled. Despite successful albums and tours, Schenker unequivocally quit UFO after their show in Palo Alto, California, on 29 October 1978. During this tour the band had recorded six concerts, from which selected tracks would make up their live album &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;, released after he left the band. &quot;&quot;[Singer Phil]&quot; Mogg later claimed that I left UFO over a disagreement about which version of &#x27;Rock Bottom&#x27; appeared on &quot;Strangers&quot;,&quot; Schenker recalled, &quot;but don&#x27;t believe everything you read.&quot;

Schenker briefly rejoined Scorpions in late 1978, when they were recording &quot;Lovedrive&quot;. He composed and played lead guitar on &quot;Another Piece of Meat&quot;, &quot;Coast To Coast&quot; and &quot;Lovedrive&quot;. Although it was believed for decades that those three were Schenker&#x27;s only contributions to the record, during an interview with satellite radio host Eddie Trunk, Schenker vehemently maintained that he contributed to the whole album. In 1979, Schenker briefly toured with the band in support of the album. He blamed his very short stay on finding out he did not enjoy playing other people&#x27;s songs. He was permanently replaced by Matthias Jabs, who had originally joined Scorpions before Schenker&#x27;s return.

Schenker auditioned for Aerosmith in 1979 after Joe Perry left. According to Martin Huxley, Schenker stormed out of the room after producer Gary Lyons made jokes about Nazis. After the death of Randy Rhoads, Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s first call was to Schenker to replace Rhoads, as the German guitarist and his iconic Flying V were a huge influence on the latter. But, Osbourne claims, Schenker made too many outlandish demands (including a private jet). Schenker himself, in an interview with KNAC radio, claims he was the one to say &quot;no&quot; to Osbourne: &quot;If I would have joined Ozzy Osbourne, I would have screwed up my life. I was almost about to do it, and something told me: DON&#x27;T!!&quot; Schenker has also claimed that at some point he was offered, but turned down joining the likes of Deep Purple, Thin Lizzy, Ian Hunter and Motörhead in order to focus on his solo career.

=== Michael Schenker Group, McAuley Schenker Group and UFO Reunion ===

In 1979, Schenker started a solo career by founding the Michael Schenker Group (MSG). The history of MSG is strewn with personality conflicts and incidents. In 1982, original singer Gary Barden, who sang on the first two studio albums and a live album, was fired in favour of Graham Bonnet. Bonnet lasted one album (&quot;Assault Attack&quot;) and a single gig, at Sheffield University, where he drunkenly exposed himself and was subsequently fired from the band. Barden rejoined MSG for the rest of the tour. He also appeared on the 1983 studio album (&quot;Built to Destroy&quot;) and the band&#x27;s second live album (&quot;Rock Will Never Die&quot;).

After Barden&#x27;s second departure, Schenker reorganized the band around himself and new singer Robin McAuley and renamed it the McAuley Schenker Group. The new incarnation of MSG was steered toward a more commercial hard rock sound. After three albums, Schenker and McAuley parted company. In the meantime, he briefly replaced Robbin Crosby in Ratt, appearing on their 1990 MTV Unplugged performance.

In 1993, Schenker rejoined UFO. He co-wrote (with Phil Mogg) nearly the whole of their reunion album, &quot;Walk on Water&quot; (1995), and toured with them briefly.

He then resurrected the Michael Schenker Group with all new members and recorded three more albums, &quot;Written in the Sand&quot;, &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, and &quot;Be Aware of Scorpions&quot; before rejoining UFO for two further releases, &quot;Covenant&quot; and &quot;Sharks&quot;.
=== 2000–present ===
Schenker fell on hard times in the early 2000s, despite his rejoining UFO that year. He later recorded the album &quot;Arachnophobiac&quot; and supported it with two years of touring. In 2004, recognition came from Dean Guitars, which began producing a Schenker signature Dean V (with subtle differences from the Gibson, but with the split black and white trademark Schenker finish).

2005 was the 25th anniversary of the Michael Schenker Group. Schenker put together a new album of songs called &quot;Tales of Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll&quot; to celebrate the anniversary and enlisted singers from each iteration of the band to sing on the album. However, in that same year the collection &quot;Heavy Hitters&quot;, a set of covers featuring Schenker and a revolving group of heavy metal all-stars, was marketed as a Michael Schenker Group album, with the result that Schenker only received a flat fee.

After nearly-disastrous North American and European tours in 2007, which included cancelled shows and less-than-stellar performances caused by heavy drinking, Schenker regained his composure and toured in the UK as Michael Schenker &amp; Friends in 2008. Early 2008, Schenker worked with Gary Barden, Don Airey, Simon Phillips, and Neil Murray on a new MSG album &quot;In the Midst of Beauty&quot;, which was released in May 2008, followed by touring.

In 2009 Schenker toured extensively including Russia, UK and the US with MSG including original members Gary Barden and Chris Glen.

In November 2010, Schenker was given the Marshall &quot;11&quot; award in London along with other rock legends including Ron Wood and Slash. The award was presented to Schenker by Alice Cooper, with Jimmy Page, Tony Iommi and John Paul Jones also in attendance. The award is given to &quot;those artists and musicians who represent rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll excess and livin&#x27; on the edge.&quot;

In 2011 Schenker released a new album, &quot;Temple of Rock&quot;. It was supported with a tour of Europe, Japan and the USA. In Europe the line up included Herman Rarebell on drums and Francis Buchholz on bass, both former members of Scorpions (Rarebell also joined the band for the Japanese dates) and Doogie White, formerly singer for Rainbow and Yngwie Malmsteen. With this line-up he recorded the album &quot;Bridge the Gap&quot; which was released in 2013.

In August 2012 Schenker received a Lifetime Achievement in Rock and Roll Award from &quot;Vegas Rocks! Magazine.&quot; The award was presented by David Coverdale of Whitesnake. During the award ceremony Schenker performed with Sammy Hagar of Chickenfoot, Montrose and Van Halen.

In 2016, Schenker toured Japan under the name of &quot;The Michael Schenker Fest&quot; featuring current and former singers: Doogie White, Gary Barden, Graham Bonnet and Robin McAuley, bassist Chris Glen, drummer Ted MacKenna and keyboardist/guitarist Steve Mann, releasing one live album &quot;Fest: Live Tokyo International Forum Hall&quot; (2Cd/Dvd) following two more albums, Revelation (2018) and Resurrection (2019). This lineup disbanded after the loss of the drummer Ted Mackenna in January that year.

In 2021, Schenker announced the return to the MSG brand, releasing &quot;Immortal&quot; with some of former MSG/ Fest members: singers Michael Voss, Doogie White, Robin MacAuley and Gary Barden, bassist Barry Sparks, guitarist Steve Mann and drummer Bodo Schopp along with special guests: former Rainbow singers Joe Lynn Turner and Ronnie Romero, longtime collaborators Simon Phillips and Brian Tichy on drums. The following year MSG released the album &quot;Universal&quot; featuring a new steady lineup with Mann, Schopp, Romero and bassist Barry Sparks. And as usual some special guest such as vocalists Ralph Scheepers (Primal Fear) and Michael Kiske (Helloween), former Rainbow members, keyboardist Tony Carey, drummer Bobby Rondinelli and bassist Bob Daisley. In July 2022 Dutch bassist Barend Corbois (ex-Blind Guardian) was announced as the new touring bass player.

Schenker released an album of UFO cover songs from his initial tenure with that band, titled &quot;My Years with UFO&quot;, on September 20, 2024. The album includes contributions by Guns N&#x27; Roses members Axl Rose and Slash, Biff Byford of Saxon, former Rainbow and Deep Purple frontman Joe Lynn Turner, Stephen Pearcy of Ratt, Carmine Appice, among others. Schenker also plans to release a pair of new albums in 2025 and 2026.

== Instruments and sound ==

Schenker&#x27;s main guitar for most of his career was a Gibson Flying V, which he typically played through a &quot;cocked&quot; wah-wah pedal (switched on but left in a single position, around halfway through the travel of the foot pedal, and used as an equaliser to strengthen the midrange &quot;sweet spot&quot;) and Marshall amplifiers. Schenker&#x27;s &quot;unmistakable midrange tone&quot; was emphasised by the partially engaged wah pedal, as exemplified on the song &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; from the live UFO album &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;, was listed among the 50 greatest tones of all time by &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine. Since 2004, Schenker has switched to using a signature model Dean V.

In 2007 Dean Guitars, after producing Schenker&#x27;s signature Dean V, also made two acoustic models with the familiar black and white &quot;V&quot; design.

<text>Scott Nearing (August 6, 1883 – August 24, 1983) was an American radical economist, educator, writer, political activist, pacifist, vegetarian and advocate of simple living.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Nearing was born in Morris Run, Tioga County, Pennsylvania, the heart of the state&#x27;s coal country. Nearing&#x27;s grandfather, Winfield Scott Nearing, had arrived in Tioga County with his family in 1864, at the age of 35, when he accepted a job as a civil and mining engineer. Before the end of the year he had assumed full control of mining operations as the superintendent of the Morris Run Coal Company, a position of authority which he held for the remainder of his working life. An intense, driven man, Scott Nearing&#x27;s grandfather studied science and nature, practiced gardening and carpentry, and regularly received crates of books from New York City, amassing a large personal library. In his memoirs written late in his life, Scott Nearing would recall his grandfather as one of the four most influential figures in his life. Nearing&#x27;s upbringing was that of a young bourgeois, his mother employing a part-time tutor and two Polish servants to clean the gleaming white house atop a hill overlooking the town. Scott&#x27;s brother recalled that the citizens of Morris Run had treated the handsome and intelligent Scott &quot;the way they would treat the heir to the nobleman. ... They all treated him with awe.&quot;

Nearing&#x27;s father was a small businessman and stockbroker, his mother a vigorous, energetic, and idealistic woman whom Nearing later credited with instilling in him an appreciation for the higher things in life: nature, books, and the arts. Despite an upbringing in a life of privilege made possible in no small measure by the harsh anti-union policies of his patriarchal grandfather, young Scott nevertheless developed a social conscience, which one of his biographers describes as &quot;a burr under his skin that none of his relatives acquired and that no interpretation satisfactorily explains.&quot;
Nearing graduated from high school in 1901 and enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania Law School, &quot;where corporate bias so violated his idealism that after one year he quit.&quot; Instead, he studied oratory at Temple University in Philadelphia and enrolled at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where he immersed himself in the emerging science of economics. At the Wharton School, Nearing was deeply influenced by Simon Nelson Patten, an innovative and unconventional educator and founding father of the American Economic Association. Nearing distinguished himself as a &quot;Wharton man&quot; during the progressive era, one of the proverbial &quot;best and brightest&quot; trained in practical economics to be readied for a place as a responsible leader of the community. In the words of another of his students, Patten taught innovative thinking—&quot;making use of creative intelligence to master new situations irrespective of received dogma.&quot; Nearing seems to have found these new intellectual tools for potential social change to be exciting and liberating. He completed his undergraduate program in just three years, while simultaneously engaging in campus politics and competitive debate.

Nearing received his BS degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1905 and his PhD in economics in 1909. From 1905 to 1907, he served as the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Child Labor Committee, a volunteer society working to solve the child labor problem in the state. From 1908 until 1915 while living in Arden, Delaware, Nearing taught economics and sociology at the Wharton School and Swarthmore College, authoring a stream of books on economics and social problems. Nearing was a staunch advocate of a &quot;new economics,&quot; which insisted that
 ... economists part company with the ominous pictures of an overpopulated, starving world, prostrate before the throne of &quot;competition,&quot; &quot;individual initiative,&quot; &quot;private property,&quot; or some other pseudo-god, and tell men in simple, straightforward language how they may combine, re-shape, or overcome the laws and utilize them as a blessing instead of enduring them as a burden and a curse.
Much as Karl Marx drew radical implications from the ideas of the conservative Hegel, Nearing took the economic logic of his department head, Simon Patten, and made radical inferences about wealth and the distribution of income that his mentor had hesitated to draw. He believed that unfettered wealth stifled initiative and impeded economic advancement, and hoped that progressive thinkers among the ownership class would come to realize the negative impact of economic parasitism and accept their civic duty of enlightened leadership. Nearing outlined an economic republicanism based on &quot;four basic democratic concepts—equality of opportunity, civic obligation, popular government, and human rights.&quot;

While living in Arden in 1910, Nearing learned about &quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot;, the forerunner of &quot;Monopoly&quot;, and taught it to his students. This use of the game as an instructional device led to its spread among colleges.

But Nearing&#x27;s aggressive social activism in the classroom and through the printed word brought him into conflict with his employers at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Wharton School of Business, resulting in his dismissal and his emergence as a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; of the American radical movement during the next decade. On the morning of June 16, 1915, Nearing&#x27;s secretary telephoned him to report that a letter from the provost had arrived, saying that &quot;as the term of your appointment as assistant professor of economics for 1914–1915 is about to expire, I am directed by the trustees of the University of Pennsylvania to inform you that it will not be renewed.&quot; Penn&#x27;s board of trustees was heavily stacked with bankers, corporation lawyers, financiers, and corporation executives, and Nearing&#x27;s writing had not gone unnoticed. His tenuous situation had been exacerbated by an open letter to &quot;The North American&quot; in which he challenged the right wing evangelist Billy Sunday to apply the Gospel to the conditions of industrial capitalism, including &quot;the railroad interests ... the traction company ... the manufacturers ... the vested interests.&quot; Reaction to Nearing&#x27;s dismissal from the academy was swift, with department head Patten and others issuing statements condemning the decision. Progressives in the Wharton School quickly compiled a summary of the facts of the case and sent it to 1500 newspapers, journals, and academics around the country. Even conservatives in the faculty were deeply troubled since, as one Wharton professor observed, &quot;the moment Nearing went, any conservative statement became but the spoken word of a &#x27;kept&#x27; professor.&quot; Conversely, some radicals felt vindicated in their belief in the conservative nature of the American academy. Socialist writer Upton Sinclair told Nearing in an open letter that &quot;You do not belong in a university. You belong with us Socialists and free lances . ... Instead of addressing small numbers of college boys, you will be able to address large audiences of men.&quot; Nearing&#x27;s dismissal was retrospectively called by one historian &quot;the most famous breach of academic freedom&quot; of the era.

===First World War===

From the fall of 1915, Nearing was established as a radical &quot;public man.&quot; He joined the American Union Against Militarism in 1916 and delivered a series of speeches condemning the &quot;Preparedness&quot; campaign then being promoted by Woodrow Wilson and the nation&#x27;s political elite. He also remained a university professor, teaching Social Science at the city-owned Toledo University from 1915 through 1917. The intense nationalistic feeling that swept the country now that America was embroiled at last in the war in Europe spelled the end of Nearing&#x27;s Toledo days, as he later recalled in his memoirs:
Al Miller, Chairman of the Toledo Forum, asked me to come to his office. He greeted me pleasantly and then said, &quot;As you know, I am attorney for the Toledo Chamber of Commerce, on a permanent retainer. I am their legal spokesman; they are among my clients. They have directed me to introduce a resolution at the next meeting of the Toledo university trustees, ending your connection with the institution.&quot; He waited a moment for this announcement to sink in.

&quot;Of Course,&quot; I said quietly. &quot;That is one of the symptoms of war fever. Those who tell the truth or try to tell the truth are among the first victims of any war.&quot;

Al hurried on, &quot;You understand, there is nothing personal about this. You and I have worked together on the Forum and other projects with never a real disagreement, certainly never a fight.&quot;

&quot;That is true,&quot; I said, &quot;and I think our joint efforts have helped to make some real advances here in Toledo.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; said Al. &quot;It is also true that I have enjoyed every minute of our cooperation.&quot; Then he added: &quot;At this point I guess we part company. I hope we part as friends, on two sides of the war barrier that separates us. Please remember that there is nothing personal about this,&quot; he repeated. &quot;I respect your stand and wish you well. My duty lies elsewhere.&quot; We shook hands and I never saw him again.
Nearing packed up his things and moved to New York City, where he became a founding member of the People&#x27;s Council of America for Democracy and Peace, a national pacifist organization established at the First American Conference for Peace and Democracy, held May 30–31, 1917. He assumed the chairmanship of that organization that fall. On July 1, 1917, Nearing joined the Socialist Party and began a new job, working for the next six years as a lecturer in economics and sociology at the Socialist Party&#x27;s Rand School of Social Science.

Nearing was a prolific public speaker during this time, estimating that he had given approximately 200 speeches a year during the war years. Nearing also authored a series of pamphlets, published by the Rand School, one of which, &quot;The Great Madness: A Victory for the American Plutocracy,&quot; resulted in his indictment under the Espionage Act for alleged &quot;obstruction to the recruiting and enlistment service of the United States.&quot; This indictment came down in April 1918, but it was not until February 1919—that is, several months after the war in Europe had actually ended—that the trial against Nearing and the Rand School actually commenced.

The prosecution attempted to show that Nearing, by writing against militarism, had illegally interfered with the ability of the United States government to recruit and conscript troops for its military activities in Europe. It spent its effort making Nearing admit that he had written and spoken against militarism and the war in Europe—which he was quite willing to do. But at the end of the trial, Nearing addressed the jury and made a key point:
The prosecution has not been able to show a single instance in which recruiting was obstructed. They have not been able to show a single instance in which insubordination, disloyalty, and refusal to duty was caused.
Nearing wrote: The only way to have intelligent public opinion is to have discussion, and the moment you check discussion you destroy democracy. ... 
The Constitution does not guarantee us only the right to be correct, we have a right to be honest and in error. And the views that I have expressed in this pamphlet I expressed honestly. I believe they were right. The future will show whether or not I was correct, but under the laws, as I understand it, and under the Constitution, as I understand it, every citizen in this country has the right to express himself ... on public questions.
The judge in the case, Julius M. Mayer, dismissed the first two counts of the indictment, alleging conspiracy, without sending them to the jury. Following deliberation, the jury found Nearing not guilty but the American Socialist Society guilty on the third and fourth counts of the indictment. On March 21, 1919, sentence was passed and the American Socialist Society was fined $3,000 (short of the maximum fine of $10,000), a sum ultimately collected through small donations from Socialists, labor groups, and civil libertarians in New York City.

===From Socialism to Communism===

The Socialist Party of America split in the summer of 1919, with a factionalized Communist movement leaving to forge an underground existence in the years after the Palmer Raids. A significant organized &quot;left wing&quot; inspired by the Communist International remained in the party through 1921. Nearing seems not to have participated in the factional politics of these years, but his sympathies may well have rested with the former Socialists now building the various communist parties. As an employee of the Socialist Party-affiliated Rand School of Social Science, Nearing remained in the Socialist Party until the end of 1923.

The dramatic decline of the size and strength of the Socialist Party in the first years of the 1920s took a toll on Nearing. The plummeting membership of the SPA—down below the 13,500 member mark for 1921—stood in marked contrast to the new and rapidly growing &quot;Legal Political Party&quot; of the Communists, the Workers Party of America (WPA), which surpassed the Socialist Party in size in 1922 after only a few months of existence. Nearing searched his soul in a January 1923 lecture at the Rand School, later published in the Socialist press, posing the question &quot;What Can the Radical Do?&quot; Nearing argued that the function of the radical was not administrative, but that of external critic:

The Communist radical of today will be the administrator of tomorrow, and the Communist Society will need the radical as badly as the capitalist society needs him now. It will then be the business of the radical, as it is now, not to take an appointment as justice of the Supreme Court, not to perform any particular function as a part of the established order, but to stand apart and speak his mind about the established order. ... A radical who wishes to continue being a radical cannot do so if he is an essential part of the existing order, for then he owes a certain fealty to his position. I have seen Socialists elected to office; they become, not critical functionaries, but administrators, and one cannot be both at the same time.

It was the radical&#x27;s additional function to get in touch with like-minded people in unions, cooperatives, and the sphere of political propaganda, Nearing added. It was the Communist Party&#x27;s Trade Union Educational League that was currently &quot;the liveliest thing in the trade unionism of the Middle West,&quot; attempting at &quot;boring from within&quot; to radicalize the American Federation of Labor. Outside the AF of L, on the &quot;radical left&quot; was the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), attempting to found revolutionary industrial unions. In contrast, cooperators were, by the nature of their task, localized and conservative, in Nearing&#x27;s view. Publishing was in disarray, with Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co. disorganized by wartime repression and the economics of publishing such that the production of inexpensive books was nearly impossible. Nearing produced concrete figures to show that since 1912, membership in the Socialist Party had &quot;steadily declined&quot; and drew an explosive conclusion from this:

That means, if it means anything, that in the United States as it is at present organized, the radical political movements are short-lived. And if that is true, then the Socialist Party has had its day. Through the Middle West recently I found the Socialist Party almost extinct. Since 1920 it has had first the Communist Party and then the Workers Party as rivals. ...

The Workers Party has fallen heir to the present radical political situation in the United States. Is it built to represent the American worker? So far the radical movement has represented the European worker in the United States. The opportunities for a radical political party are as great as, or greater than, ever before; the important problem before the Workers Party is to get radical ideas before the workers. Its second and more serious problem is to establish proper relations with Moscow. Moscow is strong; the Workers Party is weak; Moscow can dominate without any trouble.

Despite these misgivings, the potential of the growing organization appealed to Nearing over the malaise of the fading organization. He finally applied for membership in the WPA in December 1924 but was initially rejected, living for the next two years as a non-party fellow traveler of the organization. He finally gained admission to the Workers (Communist) Party in 1927 and went to work on the staff of its daily newspaper, &quot;The Daily Worker,&quot; on May 9, 1928, remaining there until resigning in January 1930 to publish a study on imperialism that failed to pass the organization&#x27;s ideological scrutiny. According to at least one historian, Nearing was formally expelled from the CPUSA in 1930 in connection with this decision.

In 1925, Nearing spent two months in the Soviet Union visiting schools and talking with educational authorities. &quot;It was a fascinating experience to visit this important educational laboratory in its opening experimental stages,&quot; he later recalled, noting that theories were then being actively tested with regard to subject matter, method of instruction, and social organization of students and teachers alike. The result of this visit was &quot;Education in Soviet Russia,&quot; one of the first serious studies of the nascent Soviet educational system&quot;.&quot;

In 1925 or 1926, Nearing taught a class on the law of social revolution. According to Whittaker Chambers, &quot;an infiltration of Communists ... really ran the class, steered the discussions,&quot; and tried to &quot;make the law of social revolution a Marxian law.&quot; Members included Dale Zysman, Sam Krieger, Eve Dorf, and her husband Ben Davidson, as well as Alfred J. Brooks, Myra Page, Benjamin Mandel, and Rachel Ragozin. It also included Carrie Katz, first wife of Sidney Hook, and Nerma Berman, wife of Isaiah Oggins. The result of this effort was &quot;The Law of Social Revolution. A Co-Operative Study By the Labor Research Study Group&quot; (New York: Social Science Publishers, 1926).

In 1927, Nearing made his first trip to Asia, traveling to China by ship for a three-month stay. En route, the Kuomintang Party split, with forces loyal to Chiang Kai-shek attacking and summarily executing their former Communist allies. As Nearing later recalled:
Leftists were liquidated on sight. The procedure was summary. When one was captured by Chiang&#x27;s forces, his arms were held by two Chiang soldiers while a third, with a sword, hacked off his head. The remains were left lying as a warning to other Leftists to follow Chiang or perish. I saw some heads mounted on poles.

While there, Nearing rather boldly gave a speech at Yenching University on his book &quot;The American Empire,&quot; in a room darkened so that audience members could not be later identified and denounced. Upon his return to the United States, Nearing wrote &quot;Whither China?,&quot; a book on the Chinese situation.

Nearing remained a prominent figure of the American Left throughout the decade of the 1920s, producing a series of pamphlets on various radical political themes. He was also engaged professionally on the lecture circuit, making use of an agent to arrange speaking tours for about 20 years. These speaking tours continued into the early 1930s, by which time public interest in attending live speeches and debates on political themes had waned and ill health forced Nearing&#x27;s agent into retirement.

=== Great Depression ===
Nearing and his first wife, Nellie Marguerite Seeds Nearing, were the parents of John Scott. They adopted a second son, Robert Nearing. John Scott wrote a participant&#x27;s account of having worked in industry in the Soviet Union during the 1930s. His book, &quot;Behind the Urals&quot;, tells of the great effort being put into building an industrial complex out of reach of an invasion. When the great purge started in the mid-thirties—also an indication of Stalin&#x27;s preparation for war—Scott was advised to leave, and escaped with his Russian wife and little daughter via the trans-Siberian railroad. John&#x27;s association with Henry Luce and, later, Richard Nixon caused estrangement from his father who said in a letter, &quot;I want nothing to do with him.&quot; Nearing refused to go to his son&#x27;s funeral.

He adopted a vegetarian diet when he was 35. In the 1930s and 1940s, Nearing and Helen Knothe, a lifelong vegetarian, lived together in Winhall in rural Vermont, where they had purchased a large forest tract for $2200 and a moderate-sized farm for $2500. Nearing and Knothe lived a largely ascetic and self-reliant life, growing much of their own food and putting up nine stone buildings over the course of two decades. Cash was earned from producing maple syrup and maple sugar from the trees on their land and from Scott Nearing&#x27;s occasional paid lectures.

However, in her book &quot;Meanwhile, Next Door to the Good Life&quot;, Jean Hay Bright documents that the Nearings were both heavily subsidized by substantial inheritances which supported their forest farm. In 1934, around the time they purchased the Vermont property, Helen inherited between $30,000–$40,000 from former suitor J. J. van der Leeuw (). Scott received an inheritance from his father that was said to be &quot;at least a million dollars&quot; in 1940 according to Nearing&#x27;s son Robert. Bright&#x27;s calculations make clear that while very hard working homesteaders, the Nearings never came close to supporting themselves on their &quot;cash crops&quot; as they state.

Nearing wrote and self-published many pamphlets on topics such as low income, peace throughout the world, feminism, and different environmental causes.

===Second World War===
A consistent pacifist, Nearing opposed American participation in World War II throughout the conflict. In 1943 he was fired by the Federated Press for his anti-war position, which Managing Editor Carl Haessler criticized as &quot;childish.&quot; Nearing was particularly shocked by the nuclear bombing of Japan, writing to President Harry S. Truman on August 6, 1945, the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, that &quot;your government is no longer mine.&quot;

===Cold War era===
In 1952, the Nearings decided that their dream of a communal existence in Vermont would not come to fruition, so they moved to Brooksville, Maine. With the development of a ski area at nearby Stratton Mountain, the Nearings&#x27; 750 acre Vermont farm had increased in value from $2.75 an acre to $8,000, meaning the land they had purchased for about $2,000 was worth at least $6 million. Deciding they had done nothing to justify the increase, before moving to Maine the Nearings donated the land to the town of Stratton for use as a municipal forest.

In 1954 he co-authored &quot;Living the Good Life: How to Live Simply and Sanely in a Troubled World&quot; with his second wife, Helen Nearing. The book, in which war, famine, and poverty were discussed, described a nineteen-year &quot;back to the land experiment,&quot; and also advocated modern-day &quot;homesteading&quot; and vegan organic gardening. The book became one of the main influences which inspired many young Americans, and others in countries such as Australia, to take part in the back to the land movement of the late 1960s and 1970s.

In the winter of 1956–57, the couple toured Canada, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, generating a book about their experiences called &quot;Socialists Around the World.&quot; The following winter, with their passports issued in 1956 nearing expiration, they embarked upon a trip through the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The pair visited Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad, Baku, Tashkent, and Irkutsk, touring schools and universities, apartment buildings in the process of construction, factories, and collective farms in the course of their trip. In China they saw Peking (Beijing), Wuhan and Nanking. They returned to Brooksville to write a book on their experiences, &quot;The Brave New World.&quot; The two countries were characterized in the travelogue as &quot;peaceful socialist giants&quot;:

The pro-peace attitude of the people of the Soviet Union and People&#x27;s China is not based on fear of war but on confidence in their theory and way of life. One Soviet trade unionist put the matter to us in this way. &quot;We are not afraid of war. We have been through it and survived its cruelties and horrors. We know that we can take it. Just because we have been through it and suffered from it, we know how terrible war is. It wastes materials, but worse than that, it squanders human idealism, energy, wealth and life. Still worse, those of us who are trying to build a socialist society are diverted and preoccupied by war. We know from bitter experience that if we are to engage in socialist construction we cannot fight wars. War is a full-time occupation.&quot;

After their travels to the USSR and China, New Century Publishers produced Nearing&#x27;s pamphlets on Eastern Europe and Cuba in 1962 and 1963.

===Vietnam era and thereafter===
As the Vietnam War took center stage in the mid-1960s, and as a large back-to-the-land movement developed in the U.S., a renewed interest in Nearing&#x27;s work and ideas occurred. Hundreds of anti-war believers flocked to Nearing&#x27;s home in Maine to learn homesteading practical-living skills, some also to hear a master radical&#x27;s anti-war message.

In 1968, Nearing signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

In 1973, the University of Pennsylvania formally reversed its dismissal of Nearing in 1915 by awarding him the title of Honorary Emeritus Professor of Economics. During this time, Nearing praised Albania and described its people as &quot;rested, secure, hopeful, cheerful,&quot; adding that &quot;they are building solidly and fundamentally for a better future.&quot;

Nearing appears in the film &quot;Reds&quot; (1981) as one of the many documentary &quot;witnesses,&quot; telling stories about his friend John Reed and the heady days leading up to the Russian Revolution.

== Vegetarianism ==
Scott Nearing became a vegetarian in 1917. Nearing was a vice president of the International Vegetarian Union. He was a regular speaker at the conferences held by the International Vegetarian Union. He spoke at the events in the 1950-1960s, in 1973 in Sweden, and in 1975 in Orono, Maine.

At the 13th IVU World Vegetarian Congress 1953 in Sigtuna, Sweden his speech was growing &quot;Food without Animal Residues.&quot; In the summer of 1991, the North American Vegetarian Society inducted Helen and Scott Nearing into the Vegetarian Hall of Fame.

In 2016, &quot;Portland Press Herald&quot; columnist Avery Yale Kamila reported: &quot;In the 1977 documentary film &quot;Living the Good Life,&quot; Scott Nearing stands in the couple&#x27;s huge Maine garden and addresses a group of people interested in homesteading. He explains they use absolutely no &quot;animal residues,&quot; such as manure or bonemeal, in their gardens. &quot;As vegetarians, we are against the slaughter business,&quot; he tells the crowd, &quot;and we don&#x27;t want to participate in it.&quot;&quot;

==Foreign policy analyst==
In addition to working variously as a teacher, paid public speaker, and author, Nearing wrote commentary on foreign affairs throughout his life. As an octogenarian summing up his life, Nearing recalled:

I have spent 70 years of study and travel in order to equip myself with information that would enable me to speak and write with authority on the course of world affairs. The authority I have sought is not in any sense political. It is the authority that results from collecting and classifying information on a scientific level and interpreting facts as I have found them. Since I do not speak with political authority I have no means of communicating my conclusions except by putting them in print myself and distributing them in the most advantageous way that is available to a private citizen.
Through the years, his writings on foreign affairs were distributed via several different channels. In 1921 Nearing was, along with his colleague Louis Lochner, a co-founder of a forerunner of the Federated Press, a news service that sent out domestic and international news releases and picture mats five days a week to the labor and radical press in America. Nearing remained a regular contributor to the Federated Press (controlled by the Communist Party for most of its existence) until 1943, when he was fired for his antiwar position, which Federated Press editor Carl Haessler characterized as &quot;childish.&quot; Nearing then began to contribute to an obscure monthly newsletter from Florida, &quot;World Events.&quot;

Shortly after its founding in 1949, Nearing began contributing a &quot;World Events&quot; column to the independent theoretical &quot;Monthly Review&quot;, established by dissident Marxist economists Paul Sweezy and Leo Huberman. Nearing tellingly characterized the objective of this publication as &quot;the dissemination of a true understanding of society and the reporting of dependable news of the movement toward a socialist society which is steadily spreading over the face of the globe.&quot; Through the decades, Nearing wrote thousands of pages of news and commentary on these themes, retiring from this activity only in 1970, at the age of 87.

==Death==

From his mid-nineties, Nearing&#x27;s mental and physical health was declining and he could not upkeep his garden, with his wife stating that he “only began to be old in his 90s”. A month before his death, he gave up food and his body gradually lost all strength. At first he consumed fruit juices and a week before his death he limited himself to only water. Nearing died on August 24, 1983, in his home in Harborside, Maine, eighteen days after his 100th birthday. His wife Helen was present. Nearing was cremated and his ashes were spread over his farm.

==Philosophical ideas==

During his 1919 trial for allegedly obstructing American military recruitment during World War I, at which he testified in his own defense, the prosecution asked Nearing whether he was a &quot;pacifist socialist.&quot; Nearing&#x27;s reply was illuminating; he replied that he was a &quot;pacifist&quot; and left it at that. Prosecutor Earl B. Barnes was taken aback and asked for clarification:

Q: Are you a pacifist even to class struggles?

[Nearing]: I am a pacifist in that I believe that no man has a right to do violence to any other man.

Q: Even in the class struggle?

[Nearing]: Under no circumstances.
Half a century later, in his 1972 autobiography &quot;The Making of a Radical&quot;, Nearing described himself as a pacifist, a socialist, and a vegetarian, writing, &quot;I became a vegetarian because I was persuaded that life is as valid for other creatures as it is for humans. I do not need dead animal bodies to keep me alive, strong and healthy. Therefore, I will not kill for food.&quot; Nearing listed his four most influential teachers as Leo Tolstoy, Simon Nelson Patten, his grandfather, and his mother. Other influences he acknowledged in his memoirs included Socrates, Gautama Buddha, Lao Tzu, Mahatma Gandhi, Jesus, Confucius, Henry David Thoreau, Charles Otis Whitman, Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Victor Hugo, Edward Bellamy, Olive Schreiner, Richard Maurice Bucke, and Romain Rolland&#x27;s &quot;Jean-Christophe&quot;.

Nearing&#x27;s journey over a century was described by one biographer as follows:

Nearing&#x27;s intellectual development followed a path of increasing awareness of the intransigence of the dominant classes of capitalist culture to adopt reforms that would spread the enlightenment and opportunities of the leisure classes to society as a whole. From the time of his firing from the University of Pennsylvania in 1915 through the aftermath of World War I, he experienced the limits of permissible questioning of conventional wisdom. His long, difficult journey from an orthodox reformer of the ruling class from within to a complete secessionist from capitalist cultural hegemony led him by 1932 to choose homesteading—an experiment Nearing called &quot;living the good life.&quot;

In that spirit, Nearing moved through a series of secessions—from Christianity, from politics, and finally from American society itself. He voyaged to the wilderness as if on a pilgrimage to a sacred place. His experience, along with a deeper understanding of American culture, led to the inescapable consciousness that capitalist cultural dominance was too strong to eliminate and therefore too powerful to control or mold to liberal purposes. The secessions in his life were progressive repudiations of American canons of moral conduct as well as indications of Nearing&#x27;s perception of the fragmented, segmented, discontinuous nature of American society. Only in the isolated private sphere provided by homesteading could a radical resistance and constructive challenge to capitalist culture be nurtured.

In his devotion to conscientious self-reliance, Nearing emerged as a twentieth-century colleague of Emerson and Thoreau.
This view, that Nearing chose to &quot;drop out&quot; of politics and society itself and live life as a rugged agrarian individualist at one with nature, is a common interpretation—and certainly one with some merit. Another possible reading of Nearing&#x27;s motivations and decision-making lies in his own writing. Nearing repeatedly drew inspiration from the life story of Count Leo Tolstoi, whose life Nearing clearly saw as analogous to his own:

Count Leo Tolstoi is a classic example of an individual in potential and actual conflict with his group. He was talented and had immense vitality. Until young manhood he accepted his place in the Tsarist social pattern and generally conformed to it. After some drastic experiences and much soul searching, Leo Tolstoi challenged the social system under which he lived to mortal combat. From that point until the day he left home and died in a railway station in his final attempt to win out against group pressures, his life consisted of combats with members of his family, with members of the neighboring nobility, with the army, with the Tsarist autocracy and with the established church.

The tension between the dissident individual and the group was an unenviable one, Nearing believed. In the conflict between the solitary individual and the community, Nearing identified only three possible outcomes:

(1) The individual may win out and impose himself and his ideas upon the group. The normal consequence of such an outcome is a personal dictatorship or the imposition upon the community of an oligarchy in which the dissident individual or individuals play a prominent role. (2) The division of the community into factions, one of which upholds the dissident individual, with a stalemate leading to feuding, rebellion, civil war. (3) The group wins out, imposes its will and eliminates the non-conformist. Such conflict sequences have occurred repeatedly in contemporary and in earlier history.

Nearing&#x27;s chosen lifestyle of &quot;Tolstoian,&quot; ascetic, rural self-sufficiency may be reasonably interpreted as the attempt of a self-aware dissident individual to avoid inevitably negative participation in the internal life of the group (be it a government or a political party), while retaining a keen and almost obsessive interest in the dynamics of society and the world as a whole.

In his poem &quot;America&quot;, the Beat Generation poet Allen Ginsberg called Nearing a &quot;grand old man, a real mensch&quot;&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="207962" wikidata="Q7868450" url="?curid=207962" title="USS Colorado (ACR-7)">
<text>USS &quot;Colorado&quot; (ACR-7), also referred to as &quot;Armored Cruiser No. 7&quot;, and renamed USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; (CA-7) in 1916, was a United States Navy armored cruiser. She was the second US Navy ship named &quot;Colorado&quot;, and the first to be named after the State of Colorado. The first, , was named for the Colorado River.

==Construction==
&quot;Colorado&quot; was laid down on 25 April 1901, by William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia, and launched two years later on 25 April 1903. She was sponsored by Miss C. M. Peabody, the daughter of the Governor of Colorado, James H. Peabody; and commissioned on 19 January 1905.

==Service history==

===Pre-World War I===
&quot;Colorado&quot; sailed on her shakedown cruise down the east coast to Target Bay, Culebra Island, Puerto Rico, to train in Caribbean waters, reaching Culebra, on 24 March 1905. Following the shakedown, she joined Division Four, Cruiser Squadron, Atlantic Fleet, at Provincetown, Massachusetts, on 14 May. &quot;Colorado&quot; took part in the preliminary test of , a steel floating dry dock near Solomons Island, Maryland, from 23 to 24 June 1905.

&quot;Colorado&quot; participated in a fleet problem in the Caribbean, from 10 January–17 April 1906. Captain Kennedy died while the armored cruiser maneuvered at sea. He was buried ashore at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and Lieutenant Commander Joseph L. Jayne, assumed command of the ship on 12 April 1906.

President Roosevelt held a Presidential Naval Review of a number of ships including &quot;Colorado&quot;, , , , and transport at Oyster Bay, New York, from 2–4 September 1906. &quot;Colorado&quot; then sailed for duty on the Asiatic Station, on 7 September 1906. After cruising to Japan and China to represent American interests in the Far East, she returned to San Francisco, on 27 September 1907, for exercises along the Californian and Mexican coasts, in the Hawaiian Islands, and off Central and South America.

The running aground of &quot;Colorado&quot; on 15 August 1908, lead to the upgrading and improvements of lighthouses in Puget Sound. On 26 August 1909, one of her launches had a minor collision with the ferry &quot;City of Seattle&quot;, between West Seattle and Seattle, with minor damage. She served again in the Far East, from September 1909 – February 1910.

Ceremonial visits and receptions for dignitaries highlighted the next two years, and from November 1911 – July 1912, &quot;Colorado&quot; returned to the Far East for duty. Between August and November, she sailed to land and support expeditionary troops at Corinto, Nicaragua, then patrolled Mexican waters until placed in reduced commission at Puget Sound Navy Yard on 17 May 1913.

Once more in full commission on 9 February 1915, she sailed as the flagship of the Pacific Reserve Fleet, patrolling in Mexican waters and observing and keeping in touch with interned merchant ships during the revolution. She returned to reserve status on 26 September 1915.

===World War I===
She was renamed Pueblo, in order to free up her original name for use with the , on 9 November 1916, while in overhaul.

After Submarine ran aground in Humboldt Bay, California, on 14 December 1916. sailed for Eureka, to assist in salvaging the boat on 5 January 1917. While she attempted to float the submarine on 13 January, the cruiser stranded in the first line of breakers at Samoa Beach, off Eureka. Her crewmen reached shore safely. &quot;Pueblo&quot; made for the area and stood by &quot;Milwaukee&quot; on 24 January, but attempts to salvage the stricken cruiser proved unsuccessful. &quot;Milwaukee&quot; was decommissioned on 6 March 1917, and a storm in November 1918, broke the ship in two.

&quot;Pueblo&quot; returned to full commission upon the entry of the United States into World War I, and as flagship of the Scouting Force patrolled the South Atlantic, protecting shipping, paying diplomatic calls to South American ports, and preventing the sailing of German and Austrian ships interned at Bahia, Brazil.

&quot;Pueblo&quot; returned to Norfolk, Virginia on 18 January 1918, and from 5 February – 16 October, made seven voyages to escort convoys carrying men and supplies to England. After carrying the Brazilian ambassador to the United States to Rio de Janeiro, she returned to transatlantic duty, making six voyages between Hoboken and Brest, France, to bring home veterans of the American Expeditionary Force.

===Post war===
&quot;Pueblo&quot; arrived at Philadelphia, on 8 August 1919, and was placed in reduced commission until decommissioned on 22 September. She was redesignated CA-7 in 1920. In commission for the last time from 2 April 1921 – 28 September 1927, she served as receiving ship in the 3rd Naval District. She was scrapped on 2 October 1930.

==In popular culture==
A plaque commemorating the crew of &quot;USS Colorado&quot; was shown briefly in season 13, episode 1 of &quot;American Pickers&quot;.

<text>Hipparcos was a scientific satellite of the European Space Agency (ESA), launched in 1989 and operated until 1993. It was the first space experiment devoted to precision astrometry, the accurate measurement of the positions and distances of celestial objects on the sky. This permitted the first high-precision measurements of the intrinsic brightnesses, proper motions, and parallaxes of stars, enabling better calculations of their distance and tangential velocity. When combined with radial velocity measurements from spectroscopy, astrophysicists were able to finally measure all six quantities needed to determine the motion of stars. The resulting Hipparcos Catalogue, a high-precision catalogue of more than 118,200 stars, was published in 1997. The lower-precision &quot;Tycho Catalogue&quot; of more than a million stars was published at the same time, while the enhanced Tycho-2 Catalogue of 2.5 million stars was published in 2000. &quot;Hipparcos&quot;″ follow-up mission, &quot;Gaia&quot;, was launched in 2013.

The word &quot;Hipparcos&quot; is an acronym for HIgh Precision PARallax COllecting Satellite and also a reference to the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus of Nicaea, who is noted for applications of trigonometry to astronomy and his discovery of the precession of the equinoxes.

== Background ==
By the second half of the 20th century, the accurate measurement of star positions from the ground was running into essentially insurmountable barriers to improvements in accuracy, especially for large-angle measurements and systematic terms. Problems were dominated by the effects of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, but were compounded by complex optical terms, thermal and gravitational instrument flexures, and the absence of all-sky visibility. A formal proposal to make these exacting observations from space was first put forward in 1967.

The mission was originally proposed to the French space agency CNES, which considered it too complex and expensive for a single national programme and recommended that it be proposed in a multinational context. Its acceptance within the European Space Agency&#x27;s scientific programme, in 1980, was the result of a lengthy process of study and lobbying. The underlying scientific motivation was to determine the physical properties of the stars through the measurement of their distances and space motions, and thus to place theoretical studies of stellar structure and evolution, and studies of galactic structure and kinematics, on a more secure empirical basis. Observationally, the objective was to provide the positions, parallaxes, and annual proper motions for some 100,000 stars with an unprecedented accuracy of 0.002 arcseconds, a target in practice eventually surpassed by a factor of two. The name of the space telescope, &quot;Hipparcos&quot;, was an acronym for &quot;High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite&quot;, and it also reflected the name of the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who is considered the founder of trigonometry and the discoverer of the precession of the equinoxes (due to the Earth wobbling on its axis).

== Satellite and payload ==
The spacecraft carried a single all-reflective, eccentric Schmidt telescope, with an aperture of . A special beam-combining mirror superimposed two fields of view, 58° apart, into the common focal plane. This complex mirror consisted of two mirrors tilted in opposite directions, each occupying half of the rectangular entrance pupil, and providing an unvignetted field of view of about 1° × 1°. The telescope used a system of grids, at the focal surface, composed of 2688 alternate opaque and transparent bands, with a period of 1.208 arc-sec (8.2 micrometre). Behind this grid system, an image dissector tube (photomultiplier type detector) with a sensitive field of view of about 38-arc-sec diameter converted the modulated light into a sequence of photon counts (with a sampling frequency of 1200 Hz) from which the phase of the entire pulse train from a star could be derived. The apparent angle between two stars in the combined fields of view, modulo the grid period, was obtained from the phase difference of the two star pulse trains. Originally targeting the observation of some 100,000 stars, with an astrometric accuracy of about 0.002 arc-sec, the final &quot;Hipparcos Catalogue&quot; comprised nearly 120,000 stars with a median accuracy of slightly better than 0.001 arc-sec (1 milliarc-sec).

An additional photomultiplier system viewed a beam splitter in the optical path and was used as a star mapper. Its purpose was to monitor and determine the satellite attitude, and in the process, to gather photometric and astrometric data of all stars down to about 11th magnitude. These measurements were made in two broad bands approximately corresponding to B and V in the (Johnson) UBV photometric system. The positions of these latter stars were to be determined to a precision of 0.03 arc-sec, which is a factor of 25 less than the main mission stars. Originally targeting the observation of around 400,000 stars, the resulting &quot;Tycho Catalogue&quot; comprised just over 1 million stars, with a subsequent analysis extending this to the Tycho-2 Catalogue of about 2.5 million stars.

The attitude of the spacecraft about its center of gravity was controlled to scan the celestial sphere in a regular precessional motion maintaining a constant inclination between the spin axis and the direction to the Sun. The spacecraft spun around its Z-axis at the rate of 11.25 revolutions/day (168.75 arc-sec/s) at an angle of 43° to the Sun. The Z-axis rotated about the Sun-satellite line at 6.4 revolutions/year.

The spacecraft consisted of two platforms and six vertical panels, all made of aluminum honeycomb. The solar array consisted of three deployable sections, generating around 300 W in total. Two S-band antennas were located on the top and bottom of the spacecraft, providing an omni-directional downlink data rate of 24 kbit/s. An attitude and orbit-control subsystem (comprising 5-newton hydrazine thrusters for course manoeuvres, 20-millinewton cold gas thrusters for attitude control, and gyroscopes for attitude determination) ensured correct dynamic attitude control and determination during the operational lifetime.

== Principles ==
Some key features of the observations were as follows:
* through observations from space, the effects of astronomical seeing due to the atmosphere, instrumental gravitational flexure and thermal distortions could be obviated or minimised;
* all-sky visibility permitted a direct linking of the stars observed all over the celestial sphere;
* the two viewing directions of the satellite, separated by a large and suitable angle (58°), resulted in a rigid connection between quasi-instantaneous one-dimensional observations in different parts of the sky. In turn, this led to parallax determinations which are absolute (rather than relative, with respect to some unknown zero-point);
* the continuous ecliptic-based scanning of the satellite resulted in an optimum use of the available observing time, with a resulting catalogue providing reasonably homogeneous sky density and uniform astrometric accuracy over the entire celestial sphere;

* the various geometrical scan configurations for each star, at multiple epochs throughout the 3-year observation programme, resulted in a dense network of one-dimensional positions from which the barycentric coordinate direction, the parallax, and the object&#x27;s proper motion, could be solved for in what was effectively a global least squares reduction of the totality of observations. The astrometric parameters as well as their standard errors and correlation coefficients were derived in the process;
* since the number of independent geometrical observations per object was large (typically of order 30) compared with the number of unknowns for the standard model (five astrometric unknowns per star), astrometric solutions not complying with this simple five-parameter model could be expanded to take into account the effects of double or multiple stars, or non-linear photocentric motions ascribed to unresolved astrometric binaries;
* a somewhat larger number of actual observations per object, of order 110, provided accurate and homogeneous photometric information for each star, from which mean magnitudes, variability amplitudes, and in many cases period and variability type classification could be undertaken.

== Development, launch and operations ==
The &quot;Hipparcos&quot; satellite was financed and managed under the overall authority of the European Space Agency (ESA). The main industrial contractors were Matra Marconi Space (now EADS Astrium) and Alenia Spazio (now Thales Alenia Space).

Other hardware components were supplied as follows: the beam-combining mirror from REOSC at Saint-Pierre-du-Perray, France; the spherical, folding and relay mirrors from Carl Zeiss AG in Oberkochen, Germany; the external straylight baffles from CASA in Madrid, Spain; the modulating grid from CSEM in Neuchâtel, Switzerland; the mechanism control system and the thermal control electronics from Dornier Satellite Systems in Friedrichshafen, Germany; the optical filters, the experiment structures and the attitude and orbit control system from Matra Marconi Space in Vélizy, France; the instrument switching mechanisms from Oerlikon-Contraves in Zürich, Switzerland; the image dissector tube and photomultiplier detectors assembled by the Dutch Space Research Organisation (SRON) in the Netherlands; the refocusing assembly mechanism designed by TNO-TPD in Delft, Netherlands; the electrical power subsystem from British Aerospace in Bristol, United Kingdom; the structure and reaction control system from Daimler-Benz Aerospace in Bremen, Germany; the solar arrays and thermal control system from Fokker Space System in Leiden, Netherlands; the data handling and telecommunications system from Saab Ericsson Space in Gothenburg, Sweden; and the apogee boost motor from SEP in France. Groups from the Institut d&#x27;Astrophysique in Liège, Belgium and the Laboratoire d&#x27;Astronomie Spatiale in Marseille, France, contributed optical performance, calibration and alignment test procedures; Captec in Dublin. Ireland, and Logica in London contributed to the on-board software and calibration.

The &quot;Hipparcos&quot; satellite was launched (with the direct broadcast satellite TV-Sat 2 as co-passenger) on an Ariane 4 launch vehicle, flight V33, from Centre Spatial Guyanais, Kourou, French Guiana, on 8 August 1989. Launched into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), the Mage-2 apogee boost motor failed to fire, and the intended geostationary orbit was never achieved. However, with the addition of further ground stations, in addition to ESA operations control centre at European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Germany, the satellite was successfully operated in its geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) for almost 3.5 years. All of the original mission goals were, eventually, exceeded.

Including an estimate for the scientific activities related to the satellite observations and data processing, the &quot;Hipparcos&quot; mission cost about €600 million (in year 2000 economic conditions), and its execution involved some 200 European scientists and more than 2,000 individuals in European industry.

== Hipparcos Input Catalogue ==
The satellite observations relied on a pre-defined list of target stars. Stars were observed as the satellite rotated, by a sensitive region of the image dissector tube detector. This pre-defined star list formed the &quot;Hipparcos Input Catalogue&quot; (HIC): each star in the final &quot;Hipparcos Catalogue&quot; was contained in the Input Catalogue. The Input Catalogue was compiled by the INCA Consortium over the period 1982–1989, finalised pre-launch, and published both digitally and in printed form.

Although fully superseded by the satellite results, it nevertheless includes supplemental information on multiple system components as well as compilations of radial velocities and spectral types which, not observed by the satellite, were not included in the published &quot;Hipparcos Catalogue&quot;.

Constraints on total observing time, and on the uniformity of stars across the celestial sphere for satellite operations and data analysis, led to an Input Catalogue of some 118,000 stars. It merged
two components: first, a survey of around 58,000 objects as complete as possible to the following limiting magnitudes:
V&lt;7.9 + 1.1sin|b| for spectral types earlier than G5, and
V&lt;7.3 + 1.1sin|b| for spectral types later than G5 (b is the Galactic latitude). Stars constituting this survey are flagged in the &quot;Hipparcos Catalogue&quot;.

The second component comprised additional stars selected according to their scientific interest, with none fainter than about magnitude V=13 mag. These were selected from around 200 scientific proposals submitted on the basis of an Invitation for Proposals issued by ESA in 1982, and prioritised by the Scientific Proposal Selection Committee in consultation with the Input Catalogue Consortium. This selection had to balance &#x27;a priori&#x27; scientific interest, and the observing programme&#x27;s limiting magnitude, total observing time, and sky uniformity constraints.

== Data reductions ==
For the main mission results, the data analysis was carried out by two independent scientific teams, NDAC and FAST, together comprising some 100 astronomers and scientists, mostly from European (ESA-member state) institutes. The analyses, proceeding from nearly 1000 Gbit of satellite data acquired over 3.5 years, incorporated a comprehensive system of cross-checking and validation, and is described in detail in the published catalogue.

A detailed optical calibration model was included to map the transformation from sky to instrumental coordinates. Its adequacy could be verified by the detailed measurement residuals. The Earth&#x27;s orbit, and the satellite&#x27;s orbit with respect to the Earth, were essential for describing the location of the observer at each epoch of observation, and were supplied by an appropriate Earth ephemeris combined with accurate satellite ranging. Corrections due to special relativity (stellar aberration) made use of the corresponding satellite velocity. Modifications due to general relativistic light bending were significant (4 milliarc-sec at 90° to the ecliptic) and corrected for deterministically assuming γ=1 in the PPN formalism. Residuals were examined to establish limits on any deviations from this general relativistic value, and no significant discrepancies were found.

== Reference frame ==
The satellite observations essentially yielded highly accurate relative positions of stars with respect to each other, throughout the measurement period (1989–1993). In the absence of direct observations of extragalactic sources (apart from marginal observations of quasar 3C 273) the resulting rigid reference frame was transformed to an inertial frame of reference linked to extragalactic sources. This allows surveys at different wavelengths to be directly correlated with the &quot;Hipparcos&quot; stars, and ensures that the catalogue proper motions are, as far as possible, kinematically non-rotating. The determination of the relevant three solid-body rotation angles, and the three time-dependent rotation rates, was conducted and completed in advance of the catalogue publication. This resulted in an accurate but indirect link to an inertial, extragalactic, reference frame.
A variety of methods to establish this reference frame link before catalogue publication were included and appropriately weighted: interferometric observations of radio stars by VLBI networks, MERLIN and Very Large Array (VLA); observations of quasars relative to &quot;Hipparcos&quot; stars using charge-coupled device (CCD), photographic plates, and the Hubble Space Telescope; photographic programmes to determine stellar proper motions with respect to extragalactic objects (Bonn, Kiev, Lick, Potsdam, Yale/San Juan); and comparison of Earth rotation parameters obtained by Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) and by ground-based optical observations of &quot;Hipparcos&quot; stars. Although very different in terms of instruments, observational methods and objects involved, the various techniques generally agreed to within 10 milliarc-sec in the orientation and 1 milliarc-sec/year in the rotation of the system. From appropriate weighting, the coordinate axes defined by the published catalogue are believed to be aligned with the extragalactic radio frame to within ±0.6 milliarc-sec at the epoch J1991.25, and non-rotating with respect to distant extragalactic objects to within ±0.25 milliarc-sec/yr.

The &quot;Hipparcos&quot; and Tycho Catalogues were then constructed such that the resulting &quot;Hipparcos&quot; celestial reference frame (HCRF) coincides, to within observational uncertainties, with the &quot;International Celestial Reference Frame&quot; (ICRF), and representing the best estimates at the time of the catalogue completion (in 1996). The HCRF is thus a materialisation of the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) in the optical domain. It extends and improves the J2000 (FK5) system, retaining approximately the global orientation of that system but without its regional errors.

== Double and multiple stars ==
Whilst of enormous astronomical importance, double stars and multiple stars provided considerable complications to the observations (due to the finite size and profile of the detector&#x27;s sensitive field of view) and to the data analysis. The data processing classified the astrometric solutions as follows:
* single-star solutions: 100,038 entries, of which 6,763 were flagged as suspected double
* component solutions (Annex C): 13,211 entries, comprising 24,588 components in 12,195 solutions
* acceleration solutions (Annex G): 2,622 solutions
* orbital solutions (Annex O): 235 entries
* variability-induced movers (Annex V): 288 entries
* stochastic solutions (Annex X): 1,561 entries
* no valid astrometric solution: 263 entries (of which 218 were flagged as suspected double)

If a binary star has a long orbital period such that non-linear motions of the photocentre were insignificant over the short (3-year) measurement duration, the binary nature of the star would pass unrecognised by &quot;Hipparcos&quot;, but could show as a &quot;Hipparcos&quot; proper motion discrepant compared to those established from long temporal baseline proper motion programmes on ground. Higher-order photocentric motions could be represented by a 7-parameter, or even 9-parameter model fit (compared to the standard 5-parameter model), and typically such models could be enhanced in complexity until suitable fits were obtained. A complete orbit, requiring 7 elements, was determined for 45 systems. Orbital periods close to one year can become degenerate with the parallax, resulting in unreliable solutions for both. Triple or higher-order systems provided further challenges to the data processing.

== Photometric observations ==
The highest accuracy photometric data were provided as a by-product of the main mission astrometric observations. They were made in a broad-band visible light passband, specific to &quot;Hipparcos&quot;, and designated Hp. The median photometric precision, for Hp&lt;9 magnitude, was 0.0015 magnitude, with typically 110 distinct observations per star throughout the 3.5-year observation period. As part of the data reduction and catalogue production, new variables were identified and designated with appropriate variable star designations. Variable stars were classified as periodic or unsolved variables; the former were published with estimates of their period, variability amplitude, and variability type. In total some 11,597 variable objects were detected, of which 8,237 were newly classified as variable. There are, for example, 273 Cepheid variables, 186 RR Lyr variables, 108 Delta Scuti variables, and 917 eclipsing binary stars. The star mapper observations, constituting the Tycho (and Tycho-2) Catalogue, provided two colours, roughly B and V in the Johnson UBV photometric system, important for spectral classification and effective temperature determination.

== Radial velocities ==
Classical astrometry concerns only motions in the plane of the sky and ignores the star&#x27;s radial velocity, i.e. its space motion along the line-of-sight. Whilst critical for an understanding of stellar kinematics, and hence population dynamics, its effect is generally imperceptible to astrometric measurements (in the plane of the sky), and therefore it is generally ignored in large-scale astrometric surveys. In practice, it can be measured as a Doppler shift of the spectral lines. More strictly, however, the radial velocity does enter a rigorous astrometric formulation. Specifically, a space velocity along the line-of-sight means that the transformation from tangential linear velocity to (angular) proper motion is a function of time. The resulting effect of secular or perspective acceleration is the interpretation of a transverse acceleration actually arising from a purely linear space velocity with a significant radial component, with the positional effect proportional to the product of the parallax, the proper motion, and the radial velocity. At the accuracy levels of &quot;Hipparcos&quot; it is of (marginal) importance only for the nearest stars with the largest radial velocities and proper motions, but was accounted for in the 21 cases for which the accumulated positional effect over two years exceeds 0.1 milliarc-sec. Radial velocities for &quot;Hipparcos Catalogue&quot; stars, to the extent that they are presently known from independent ground-based surveys, can be found from the astronomical database of the Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg.

The absence of reliable distances for the majority of stars means that the angular measurements made, astrometrically, in the plane of the sky, cannot generally be converted into true space velocities in the plane of the sky. For this reason, astrometry characterises the transverse motions of stars in angular measure (e.g. arcsec per year) rather than in km/s or equivalent. Similarly, the typical absence of reliable radial velocities means that the transverse space motion (when known) is, in any case, only a component of the complete, three-dimensional, space velocity.

== Published catalogues ==


The final &quot;Hipparcos Catalogue&quot; was the result of the critical comparison and merging of the two (NDAC and FAST consortia) analyses, and contains 118,218 entries (stars or multiple stars), corresponding to an average of some three stars per square degree over the entire sky. Median precision of the five astrometric parameters (Hp&lt;9 magnitude) exceeded the original mission goals, and are between 0.6 and 1.0 mas. Some 20,000 distances were determined to better than 10%, and 50,000 to better than 20%. The inferred ratio of external to standard errors is ≈1.0–1.2, and estimated systematic errors are below 0.1 mas. The number of solved or suspected double or multiple stars is 23,882. Photometric observations yielded multi-epoch photometry with a mean number of 110 observations per star, and a median photometric precision (Hp&lt;9 magnitude) of 0.0015 magnitude, with 11,597 entries were identified as variable or possibly-variable.

For the star mapper results, the data analysis was carried out by the Tycho Data Analysis Consortium (TDAC). The Tycho Catalogue comprises more than one million stars with 20–30 milliarc-sec astrometry and two-colour (B and V band) photometry.

The final &quot;Hipparcos&quot; and &quot;Tycho Catalogues&quot; were completed in August 1996. The catalogues were published by European Space Agency (ESA) on behalf of the scientific teams in June 1997.

A more extensive analysis of the star mapper (Tycho) data extracted additional faint stars from the data stream. Combined with old photographic plate observations made several decades earlier as part of the Astrographic Catalogue programme, the Tycho-2 Catalogue of more than 2.5 million stars (and fully superseding the original Tycho Catalogue) was published in 2000.

The &quot;Hipparcos&quot; and &quot;Tycho-1 Catalogues&quot; were used to create the Millennium Star Atlas: an all-sky atlas of one million stars to visual magnitude 11. Some 10,000 nonstellar objects are also included to complement the catalogue data.

Between 1997 and 2007, investigations into subtle effects in the satellite attitude and instrument calibration continued. A number of effects in the data that had not been fully accounted for were studied, such as scan-phase discontinuities and micrometeoroid-induced attitude jumps. A re-reduction of the associated steps of the analysis was eventually undertaken.

This has led to improved astrometric accuracies for stars brighter than Hp=9.0 magnitude, reaching a factor of about three for the brightest stars (Hp&lt;4.5 magnitude), while also underlining the conclusion that the &quot;Hipparcos Catalogue&quot; as originally published is generally reliable within the quoted accuracies.

All catalogue data are available online from the Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg.

== Scientific results ==
The &quot;Hipparcos&quot; results have affected a very broad range of astronomical research, which can be classified into three major themes:

* the provision of an accurate reference frame: this has allowed the consistent and rigorous re-reduction of historical astrometric measurements, including those from Schmidt plates, meridian circles, the 100-year-old Astrographic Catalogue, and 150 years of Earth-orientation measurements. These, in turn, have yielded a dense reference framework with high-accuracy, long-term proper motions (the Tycho-2 Catalogue). Reduction of current state-of-the-art survey data has yielded the dense UCAC2 Catalogue of the U.S. Naval Observatory on the same reference system, and improved astrometric data from recent surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2MASS. Implicit in the high-accuracy reference frame is the measurement of gravitational lensing and the detection and characterisation of double and multiple stars;
* constraints on stellar structure and stellar evolution: the accurate distances and luminosities of 100,000 stars has provided the most comprehensive and accurate data set of fundamental stellar parameters to date, placing constraints on internal rotation, element diffusion, convective motions, and asteroseismology. Combined with theoretical models and other data it yields evolutionary masses, radii, and ages for large numbers of stars covering a wide range of evolutionary states;
* Galactic kinematics and dynamics: the uniform and accurate distances and proper motions have provided a substantial advance in understanding of stellar kinematics and the dynamical structure of the solar neighbourhood, ranging from the presence and evolution of clusters, associations and moving groups, the presence of resonance motions due to the Galaxy&#x27;s central bar and spiral arms, determination of the parameters describing galactic rotation, discrimination of the disk and halo populations, evidence for halo accretion, and the measurement of space motions of runaway stars, globular clusters, and many other types of star.

Associated with these major themes, &quot;Hipparcos&quot; has provided results in topics as diverse as Solar System science, including mass determinations of asteroids, Earth&#x27;s rotation and Chandler wobble; the internal structure of white dwarfs; the masses of brown dwarfs; the characterisation of extra-solar planets and their host stars; the height of the Sun above the Galactic mid-plane; the age of the Universe; the stellar initial mass function and star formation rates; and strategies for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The high-precision multi-epoch photometry has been used to measure variability and stellar pulsations in many classes of objects. The &quot;Hipparcos&quot; and &quot;Tycho&quot; catalogues are now routinely used to point ground-based telescopes, navigate space missions, and drive public planetaria.

Since 1997, several thousand scientific papers have been published making use of the &quot;Hipparcos&quot; and &quot;Tycho&quot; catalogues. A detailed review of the &quot;Hipparcos&quot; scientific literature between 1997 and 2007 was published in 2009, and a popular account of the project in 2010. Some examples of notable results include (listed chronologically):

* studies of Galactic rotation from Cepheid variables 
* the nature of Delta Scuti variables 

* studies of local stellar kinematics
* testing the white dwarf mass–radius relation 
* the structure and dynamics of the Hyades cluster

* kinematics of Wolf–Rayet stars and O-type runaway stars 

* subdwarf parallaxes: metal-rich clusters and the thick disk 
* fine structure of the red giant clump and associated distance determinations 
* unexpected stellar velocity distribution in the warped Galactic disk 

* confirming the Lutz–Kelker bias of parallax measurement 
* refining the Oort and Galactic constants 
* Galactic disk dark matter, terrestrial impact cratering and the law of large numbers 
* vertical motion and expansion of the Gould Belt

* the use of gamma-ray bursts as direction and time markers in SETI strategies 
* evidence of a galaxy merger in the early formation history of the Milky Way 
* study of nearby OB associations
* close approaches of stars to the Solar System
* studies of binary star orbits and masses 

* the HD 209458 planetary transits 
* formation of the stellar Galactic halo and thick disk 

* the local density of matter in the Galaxy and the Oort limit
* ice age epochs and the Sun&#x27;s path through the Galaxy 
* local kinematics of K and M giants and the concept of superclusters 

* an improved reference frame for long-term Earth rotation studies 
* the local stellar velocity field in the Galaxy 
* Identification of two possible &quot;siblings&quot; of the Sun (HIP 87382 and HIP 47399), to be studied for evidence of exoplanets

=== The Pleiades distance controversy ===
One controversial result has been the derived proximity, at about 120 parsecs, of the Pleiades cluster, established both from the original catalogue as well as from the revised analysis. This has been contested by various other recent work, placing the mean cluster distance at around 130 parsecs.

According to a 2012 paper, the anomaly was due to the use of a weighted mean when there is a correlation between distances and distance errors for stars in clusters. It is resolved by using an unweighted mean. There is no systematic bias in the Hipparcos data when it comes to star clusters.

In August 2014, the discrepancy between the cluster distance of as measured by &quot;Hipparcos&quot; and the distance of derived with other techniques was confirmed by parallax measurements made using VLBI, which gave , the most accurate and precise distance yet presented for the cluster.

=== Polaris ===
Another distance debate set-off by Hipparcos is for the distance to the star Polaris.

=== Hipparcos-Gaia ===
Hipparcos data is recently being used together with Gaia data. Especially the comparison of the proper motion of stars from both spacecraft is being used to search for hidden binary companions. Hipparcos-Gaia data is also used to measure the dynamical mass of known binaries, such as substellar companions. Hipparcos-Gaia data was used to measure the mass of the exoplanet Beta Pictoris b and is sometimes used to study other long-period exoplanets, such as HR 5183 b.

<text>The Multiface is a hardware peripheral released by Romantic Robot for several 1980s home computers. The primary function of the device was to dump the computer&#x27;s memory to external storage. Pressing a red button on the Multiface activated it. As most games of the era did not have a save game feature, the Multiface allowed players to save their position by saving a loadable snapshot of the game. Home computer software of the early 1980s was typically loaded into RAM in one go, with copy protection measures concentrating the loading phase or just after it. The snapshot feature could be used after copy protection routines had been executed, to create a backup that was effectively unprotected against unauthorised distribution. Later models of the Multiface mitigated this by requiring the device to be present when re-loading the dumps into memory, making the dumps useless to people without a Multiface. Software producers also reacted to the threat by using routines that would prevent execution of the product if it detected that a Multiface was present and by loading the software in multiple parts, thus requiring the presence of the original, copy-protected media.

== Operation ==
Pressing the red button on the Multiface raised the non-maskable interrupt line on the computer&#x27;s processor, effectively taking control of the computer. The Multiface would then page in its own ROM, temporarily replacing the computer&#x27;s operating system with that within the Multiface.

== Additional features ==
* All Multifaces had the ability to view and edit the contents of memory. This made cheating in games especially easy: magazines used to print codes every month, known as &#x27;pokes&#x27;. By changing the memory, various aspects of the game could be altered, such as the number of lives one had before the game was over.
* Some models of Multiface allowed the user to save a screenshot, and this is how Your Sinclair and likely other magazines produced screenshots of games.
* Multifaces contained an extra 8 kilobytes of RAM that could be used by specially written software. Examples of such software included Genie, a machine code disassembler, and Lifeguard, a program for analysing the memory of a game during play in order to identify which memory locations should be changed to aid cheating. These programs could be loaded into the Multiface RAM and activated by pressing the red button.
* Some later Multifaces had a &#x27;thru-port&#x27;, an additional interface on the back of the unit which allowed other peripherals to be plugged into the back. This solved the problem of the Multiface using up the computer&#x27;s only expansion port.

== Models of Multiface ==
Multifaces were released for 8-bit and 16-bit microcomputers, such as the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC &amp; Atari ST. Different models had slightly different features.

The Multiface One was released in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum 48K. It initially cost £39.95 () and had the capability of saving data to cassette tape, ZX Microdrive, Opus Discovery (an external 3.5 inch disk drive) or Technology Research Beta (an interface that allowed 5.25 inch and 3.5 inch drives to be connected). The device worked on 128K Spectrums, but only if they were put in 48K mode. It featured a Kempston joystick port, and later revisions contained a switch that effectively &#x27;hid&#x27; the device from software. Early versions had a composite video out port but this feature was later removed.

=== Multiface Two ===

The Multiface Two was released for the Amstrad CPC range of computers and had similar features to the Multiface One, but added a button to reset the computer. Control of the visibility of the device was at a software level rather than the hardware switch found on the Multiface One.

=== Multiface 128 ===

The Multiface 128 was released in April 1987 for the 128K version of the Spectrum, including the original +2 model. It worked in 128K or 48K mode and it existed in two versions; initially without a &#x27;thru-port&#x27; and later, with one, both of which originally cost the same £44.95, () but were later reduced to the same price as the Multiface One. The 128 introduced the ability to save to the +D and DISCiPLE disk systems, but lost its joystick port (the Spectrum +2 already had built-in joystick ports). The device was not compatible with the later Spectrum +2A or the Spectrum +3.

=== Multiface 3 ===

The Multiface 3, released in November 1987, was designed for the later Amstrad-made models of Spectrum that the 128 did not support. It existed in two versions; one with a &#x27;thru-port&#x27;, for £49.95 (), and one without, which cost £44.95 (). Both were later reduced to £29.95 (). The main feature of the Multiface 3 was its ability to save to +3 disk, a useful feature for +3 owners who wanted to avoid the long loading times of tapes.

=== Multiface ST ===

The Multiface ST and Multiface ST II were released for Atari&#x27;s ST computers. They connected to the cartridge port with a wired connector attaching to the monitor port (to generate the interrupt signal when the button was pressed). Far less effective than the earlier Spectrum models and the same as the CPC model, they required the cartridge to be present in order to load saved games. Red, green and blue cartridges have been noted.

== Anti-Multiface ==

&quot;Anti-Multiface&quot; was a public domain program for the Amstrad CPC which allowed the restoring of saved memory dumps without the need for a Multiface to be present. It was limited to 128K machines and would not work on dumps bigger than 64K. The program was developed by Serge Querne but credited to &quot;Merlin J. Bond of Magic Software&quot;.

== Similar products ==
Competing devices included the Mirage Imager, Disk Wizard, and Action Replay. At the time, none of these could save as many games, or offered the opportunities for cheating that Multiface did. Action Replays for cheating have since been released on newer systems. Other competing systems were a wide array of software-based transfer programs.

For game consoles of the 1990s there was the Game Genie, which served a similar purpose in allowing memory values to be edited in order to cheat at games.

<text>The National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (, ; NSB) was a Dutch fascist and later Nazi political organisation that eventually became a political party. As a parliamentary party participating in legislative elections, the NSB had some success during the 1930s. Under German occupation, it remained the only legal party in the Netherlands during most of the Second World War.

== History ==
=== Early years (1931–1936) ===
The NSB was founded in Utrecht in 1931 during a period when several nationalist, fascist and Nazi parties were founded. The founders were Anton Mussert, who became the party&#x27;s leader, and Cornelis van Geelkerken. The party based its program on Italian fascism and German Nazism: however, unlike the latter, before 1936 the party was not antisemitic and even had Jewish members.

In 1933, after a year of building an organization, the party organized its first public meeting, a &quot;Landdag&quot; in Utrecht which was attended by 600 party militants. Here the party presented itself. After that, the party&#x27;s support began to grow. In the same year, the government forbade civil servants to be members.

In the provincial elections of 1935, the party gained almost eight percent of the votes and two seats in the Senate. This was achieved against the background of the economic hardship of the Great Depression, which increased the party&#x27;s stature until 1937. Mussert&#x27;s image as a reliable politician and his pragmatism allowed him to unite the different types of fascism and contributed to the party&#x27;s success. This was bolstered by the party&#x27;s strong organization and its political strategy, which was not oriented towards revolution but a democratic and legal take over of the country. By 1936, the party was holding annual mass meetings near Lunteren in Gelderland and, in 1938, it built the Muur van Mussert there, a wall which was supposed to be one element in a set of buildings and monuments inspired by the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg.

=== Nazi influence (1936–1940) ===
In 1936, under the influence of Meinoud Rost van Tonningen, the party became more radical and openly antisemitic. Rost van Tonningen began to question Mussert&#x27;s leadership, with the support of the German Nazi Party, increasing divisions within the party. This radicalisation led to decreased support for the party and a strong anti-fascist reaction of the political parties, trade unions and churches. In the 1937 general elections, the party gained only four percent of the votes and four seats in the House of Representatives, although it increased its representation in the Senate to five seats. After 1937, the party&#x27;s stature diminished and many members left.

In parliament, the NSB MPs showed little respect for parliamentary procedures and rules. Many NSB MPs were called to order by the chairman of parliament for physical and verbal violence.

In the provincial election of 1939, the party also gained four percent of the votes.

=== Second World War (1940–1945) ===

After the Second World War broke out, the NSB sympathized with the Germans and advocated strict neutrality for the Netherlands. In May 1940, 800 NSB members and sympathizers were put in custody by the Dutch government, after the German invasion. Supporters of the party in the Dutch East Indies were also interned at that time, and when a Japanese invasion of the colony began some of these were deported to Surinam and interned in the Jodensavanne internment camp. Soon after the Dutch defeat on 14 May 1940, the imprisoned European NSB members in the Netherlands were set free by German troops. In June 1940, Mussert delivered a speech in Lunteren in which he called for the Netherlands to embrace the Germans and renounce the Dutch Monarchy, which had fled to London.

In 1940 the German occupation government had outlawed all socialist and communist parties; in 1941 it forbade all parties, except for the NSB. The NSB openly collaborated with the occupation forces. Its membership grew to about 100,000. The NSB played an important role in lower government and civil service; every new mayor appointed by the German occupation government was a member of the NSB. On the national level, Mussert had expected he would be made leader of an independent Dutch state allied to Germany; in reality, however, the Austrian Nazi Arthur Seyss-Inquart was in charge of an occupation government. He chose to work with the remaining establishment as he realised that the NSB lacked popular support and talented candidates for more important functions.

Mussert had in total five meetings with Adolf Hitler in which he pleaded for an independent Netherlands, but he was unsuccessful. Although Seyss-Inquart had proposed that Mussert should be made Prime Minister of the Netherlands, he was only given the honorary title &#x27;Leader of the Dutch People&#x27;, and he was allowed to build a marginal State Secretariat, but he was given little or no actual power. His influence in the party waned at the expense of Rost van Tonningen and other more pro-German members. Unlike Mussert, Rost van Tonningen was in favour of incorporation of the Netherlands into a Greater Germanic Reich. Beginning in the summer of 1943, many male members of the NSB were organized in the Landwacht, which helped the government control the population.

On 4 September 1944, the Allied forces conquered Antwerp and the NSB expected the fall of the Netherlands to come soon. On 5 September, most of the NSB&#x27;s leadership and many members fled to Germany and the party&#x27;s organization fell apart, on what is known as &quot;Dolle Dinsdag&quot; (Mad Tuesday). Mussert himself spent the winter of 1944–45 at the estate of Bellinckhof, near Almelo. In these final months of the war the movement fractured further and further, and Mussert ordered measures against leaders who behaved &#x27;dishonorably&#x27; in September 1944. In the beginning of 1945 he terminated the memberships of Rost van Tonningen and Van Geelkerken. However, at that time Musserts power was severely weakened by the war events and the fracturing of the NSB.

=== Dissolution (1945) ===

After the German surrender on 6 May 1945, the NSB was outlawed. Mussert was arrested the following day. Many of the members of the NSB were arrested, but only a few were convicted.

There were no attempts to continue the organization illegally. Former members were shunned and sometimes imprisoned. After that, they and their children remained stigmatized for a long time in society. The senior party leadership was arrested and faced charges: Mussert was executed on 7 May 1946, Van Geelkerken was imprisoned, and Rost van Tonningen committed suicide while awaiting trial.

==Ideology and issues==

The NSB started out as a classical fascist party, which based itself on the principles of leadership. It wanted a fascist state with a compliant government, fascist order and state control. It put the national interest above the individual interest and the interest of social groups (pillars) that had characterized Dutch society. The party was anti-parliamentary and authoritarian. Its program, which was otherwise modeled on the program of the German Nazi Party, initially lacked reference to antisemitic or racist ideology of the Nazi Party. After 1936, under the influence of Meinoud Rost van Tonningen, the party became more oriented towards the Nazi Party and took on its antisemitic and racist ideas. It also began to sympathize with the aggressive foreign policy of Italy and Germany.

Practical demands of the NSB were: abolition of individual voting rights, corporatism, a duty to work and serve in the army, limits on the freedom of the press, laws against strikes. It demanded a unification of the Netherlands with Flanders and French Flanders in a Greater Netherlands, which would also control a large colonial empire consisting of Belgian Congo, the Dutch East Indies and perhaps South Africa. This state would not be a part of Germany, but only an independent loyal ally to Germany.

The NSB was against the current political structure of the Netherlands and parliamentary democracy itself.

== Organization ==
=== Structure ===
The party was organized with Mussert serving as party chair and political leader. From September 1940 until its dissolution, Carolus Josephus Huygen served as Secretary General of the party. Yearly the party organized a &quot;Landdag&quot;, where Mussert gave a political speech.

=== Rituals and symbols ===

The NSB copied elements of the Italian Fascists and German Nazis. Like Mussolini&#x27;s Fascists, the NSB uniforms included black shirts, and the Party adopted the Fascist salute. Since 1933 it used the salute &quot;Hou Zee!&quot;, which, Anton Mussert said, connoted courage and referred to the &quot;glorious&quot; maritime history of the Dutch Republic. It also began using titles like &quot;Leider&quot; for Mussert (Leader; similar to Duce or Führer), &quot;Kameraad&quot; for men (comrade) and &quot;Kameraadske&quot; (&#x27;comradess&#x27;, a neologism) for women. One party slogan was &quot;Mussert or Moscow&quot;, evoking the Fascist defense against supposed Communist subversion. Although the Party later adopted the Nazi red and black colors and the swastika symbol, the original NSB flag used the Prince&#x27;s Flag. A blue &quot;wolfsangel&quot; (a hooked symbol of a wolf trap) on a white disc was set against an orange field.

=== Party membership ===

Historians Lou de Jong and A.A. de Jonge have characterized NSB members as socially isolated opportunists who were motivated to join the NSB through a mix of opportunism, idealism and social connections.

=== Support and electorate ===
The NSB drew its main support from the middle class: civil servants, farmers, business people and soldiers supported the party. Most of these people were not part of the strong pillarized organisations surrounding the socialist unions, and the Protestant and Catholic churches. Instead they were often a loose member of the weaker liberal pillar, which was very diverse. The NSB party scored particularly well in Drenthe, Gelderland and the towns of Limburg at the border with Germany. The synod of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands declared membership of the NSB irreconcilable with membership in their church denomination in 1936 and reaffirmed this in 1941. The Catholic Church warned against the party&#x27;s ideology in 1936 and banned support for the NSB in 1936 on pain of exclusion from the sacraments. A mandement from the Roman Catholic bishops declared in 1941 membership of the NSB illicit to a high degree.

=== Associated organisations ===
The NSB was surrounded by several party organizations. It published a weekly newspaper, &quot;Volk en Vaderland&quot; (&quot;People and Fatherland&quot;). Between 1931 and 1935 the party had its own paramilitary organization, the black uniformed &quot;Weerbaarheidsafdeling&quot; (WA), similar to the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; of the Nazi Party. It was refounded in 1940. It also founded its own youth organization, &quot;Nationale Jeugdstorm&quot; (Youthstorm); a farmers&#x27; organization; and a daily newspaper, &quot;Het Nationale Dagblad&quot; (The National Daily).

In 1940 the NSB formed the Nederlandsche SS (Dutch SS), which had up to 7,000 members.

The party also had a branch in the East Indies, which enjoyed some modest popularity among the mixed Dutch-Indonesian Indo population, but began to rapidly decline after the NSB started to adopt more racialist and &quot;blut und boden&quot; views, and was banned on 10 May 1940, in reaction to the European NSB entering into collaboration.

The term &quot;NSB&#x27;er&quot; has become synonymous with traitor in the Netherlands, and is used as an insult, especially in the context of ratting somebody out to authorities.

A grim joke after World War II, made by Dutch Resistance fighters, is that former NSB members insisted that their acronym actually stood for &quot;Niet So [zo] Bedoeld&quot; or &quot;I didn&#x27;t mean it like that&quot; as they attempted to downplay their treachery.

=== Relationships with other parties ===
The NSB was methodically isolated by other parties. Before the war the socialist Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party and &quot;Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen&quot; (Dutch Association of Trade Unions) coordinated counter-demonstrations and propaganda with a separate organization &#x27;Freedom, Labour and Bread&#x27;. The NSB lobbied with the German occupiers to have other political organisations outlawed. Although the Germans had no problem with banning the socialists, communists and Christian-democrats, it was considerably harder for the NSB to convince them to get rid of their fascist rivals. Eventually, the Germans forbade these too and urged members to join the NSB, as these parties were considered too small. The most important rival for the NSB was the Nederlandsche Unie, an organisation founded in 1940, which wanted to rebuild Dutch society within the cadre of the changed balance of power. Although their point of view was later considered collaborationist, many Dutch joined the movement as an alternative to the NSB, which it soon outgrew. The end for the Nederlandsche Unie came when they refused to support the German invasion of the Soviet-Union. Hence, as of 1941 to 1945, the NSB was the only permitted political party in the Netherlands.

==Electoral performance==
=== House of Representatives ===
=== Senate ===
===Municipal and provincial councils===
Before 1940 the NSB held seats in provincial and municipal legislatures, but did not cooperate in any governments. After 1940 these legislatures stopped functioning and the NSB&#x27;s role in local and provincial legislatures expanded. All newly appointed mayors were members of the NSB.
